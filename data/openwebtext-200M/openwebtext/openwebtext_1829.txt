Arbiter opens Topalov file : Veselin Topalov and his manager Silvio Danailov are being closely watched by the chief arbiter at the Corus Chess Championship after an International Master accused the duo of using ‘ illegal ’ resources to win .

Novinite – Sofia News Agency ( 27.01.07 )
Bulgaria 's top chess player Vesselin Topalov was involved in another scandal after Germany 's Suddeutsche Zeitung newspaper accused him of using help during games from his manager .
The newspaper claimed Topalov used his manager Silvio Danailov to get hints for his moves on the chessboard and that could be clearly seen on the Wijk aan Zee tournament .
Suddetusche also claims there are rumours Topalov won the San Luis 2005 world tournament using illegal means , because his manager showed him which were the best moves according to a computer program .
According to the author Danailov and Topalov communicated in a secret , non-verbal manner .

International News , Bulgaria ( 29.01.07 )
A new cheating allegation against Veselin Topalov was made at the weekend , just as the world No 1 ranked grandmaster started his grudge game against the world champion , Vladimir Kramnik , in the elite Corus tournament in Wijk aan Zee , Netherlands .
An article in a German newspaper claimed that the Bulgarian 's manager , Silvio Danailov , made suspicious hand and facial movements while in eye contact with his player during Topalov 's second - round game a week earlier against the Dutch champion , Loek van Wely .
Each time Van Wely moved , Danailov would leave the hall , make a mobile phone call and then return .
While Topalov considered his next move his manager would scratch himself several times behind his ear or tap his glasses with his finger .

India Times ( 30.01.07 )
This year 's Corus chess tournament would sadly not be remembered for the right reasons in the wake of accusations of cheating by world 's top rated Bulgarian and eventual joint winner Veselin Topalov .
The heroics of Armenian Levon Aronian , who emerged as the joint winner along with Topalov and Teimour Radjabov of Azerbaijan , or for that matter , the mediocre show by five - time winner Viswanathan Anand – were all overshadowed by the scandal .
One of his supporters backed Topalov amid the accusations .
" Veselin Topalov is a man that works for chess , its development , and promotion .
If you people , that write articles with no facts or credible arguments , do not care about the future development of chess and the ones that work for its promotion , you should at least not hinder that process , " he wrote in his website .

Short take : Veselin Topalov could have been cheating
Vijay Tagore , Tuesday , January 30 , 2007 22:59 IST
Did Veselin Topalov cheat in Corus , in San Luis and elsewhere ?
Yes , if one goes by circumstantial evidence .
One is tempted to infer that the Bulgarian Grandmaster could be the recipient of external help while wrestling with the top brains of the world .
In the Corus championship , which concluded in Wijk aan Zee , Topalov ’s behaviour was reportedly suspect .
It was not the first time though that Topalov has faced such allegations .
Immediately after the San Luis championship , a Bulgarian website reported that the former world champion had received outside help .
Most GMs believe that Topalov occasionally , if not constantly , was in non-verbal communications with his manager Silvio Danailov but no one voiced his opinion .
But for the first time , someone has .
Nigel Short , a former world championship finalist , tells DNA that Topalov could have received external help .
“ It is my understanding that the majority of players in San Luis privately believe that Topalov received signalling from Danailov during play .
The essence of these allegations , which I heard personally from disgruntled players in Argentina at the time , was not that Topalov constantly received computer advice but only at critical junctures .
Indeed , if one were to cheat , a player of Topalov ’s strength would only need two or three computer moves per game to put him at an overwhelming advantage vis-a - vis his opponents . ”
The British GM says he observed something sinister in San Luis , where Topalov bulldozed his rivals to emerge a run-away winner .
In fact , Topalov had 6.5 from seven games which could be equivalent to running 100 metres in about 9 seconds at that level of competition .
“ In San Luis I did observe , indeed I was quite struck by the fact , that Danailov sat in close physical proximity to Topalov during play .
Furthermore , his not infrequent entering and exiting the hall would have provided facile opportunities for receiving communication from a third party .
In fact any half - decent player with a laptop and an analysis engine is likely to be better appraised of the position , upon entering the room , than the GMs seated at the board themselves . ”
Short believed the World Chess ( Fide ) should order an inquiry .
“ I believe there is a clear case for setting up an independent committee of decent honorable people to examine the dozens of hours of TV footage from San Luis ( the whole event was recorded ) .
Furthermore any evidence available from Mexico and Linares , Wijk aan Zee , etc. should also be examined . ”
Short , who won the Commonwealth chess championship in November in Mumbai , terms the toiletgate charges against Vladimir Kramnik as a diversionary tactic .
“ Those of a cynical mind might view the Danailov / Topalov allegations of Kramnik ’s cheating in Elista to be a smokescreen to deflect scrutiny from their own activities . ”

Experts divided over cheating allegation against Topalov
Leonard Barden , Monday January 29 , 2007
A new cheating allegation against Veselin Topalov was made at the weekend just as the world No 1 ranked grandmaster started his grudge game against the world champion , Vladimir Kramnik , in the elite Corus tournament in Wijk aan Zee , Netherlands .
An article in a German newspaper claimed that the Bulgarian 's manager , Silvio Danailov , made suspicious hand and facial movements while in eye contact with his player during Topalov 's second - round game a week earlier against the Dutch champion , Loek van Wely .
Each time Van Wely moved , Danailov would leave the hall , make a mobile phone call and then return .
While Topalov considered his next move his manager would scratch himself several times behind his ear or tap his glasses with his finger .
It later emerged that the writer of the article , the international master Martin Breutigam , is an associate of Kramnik 's manager , Carsten Hensel ( 1 ) .
Last week a Topalov aide published a book titled Toilet War , repeating and extending the allegations that Kramnik had himself used a computer aid during their 2006 world title series in Elista in Russia , which the Muscovite won by a narrow margin .
Both Van
Wely , who attributed his 35 - move defeat to being outplayed , and the chief arbiter voiced no suspicions .
However , in the next day's third round when Topalov had a dubious position against the Ukrainian prodigy Sergey Karjakin and Danailov again tried to establish eye contact , the referee blocked his view .
It also emerged yesterday that the former Fide champion Rustam Kasimdzhanov and Russia 's world No 8 Alexander Morozevich believed there had been irregularities when Topalov won the world title in San Luis , Argentina , in 2005 .
The latest allegations have left experts deeply divided .
Many deride Breutigam 's claims .
Topalov himself , quizzed yesterday , laughed off the idea that hand signals could help his play .
An expert who examined the crucial moves in the disputed games concluded that Van Wely had lost to a normal attack .
However , there is believed to be as yet unpublished video footage of Danailov which has been shown to the all - time No 1 Garry Kasparov , who thought that there were questions to answer .
At the heart of the argument is Topalov 's sudden improvement when he was 30 .
The Bulgarians attribute this to hard work .
The jury is still out .

(1) Addendum : Martin Breutigam has replied to this article with the following statement : " I am definitely not an associate of Kramnik 's Manager , Carsten Hensel !
I am an independent journalist , I have an open mind and I ’m interested in nothing but the truth .
Please correct this mistake immediately .
Thank you very much ! "
Short pushes for cheating inqiry
Leonard Barden , Thursday February 1 , 2007
Nigel Short , the former world title challenger , has called for an International Chess Federation inquiry into cheating allegations against the world No1 - ranked grandmaster , Veselin Topalov of Bulgaria .
Last week a German newspaper published detailed claims by the German international master Martin Breutigam that Topalov 's manager , Silvio Danailov , had often left the spectator area to make mobile phone calls in the second and third rounds of the recent Corus Wijk aan Zee elite tournament .
On his return he made eye contact with his player and then hand signals .
Similar claims were made after the Fide world championship at San Luis , Argentina , in 2005 , when Topalov won the title after scoring 6.5/7 points in the first half .
Short , who was the official commentator in San Luis , told the DNAIndia news group : " I personally heard allegations from disgruntled players in Argentina at the time that Topalov received computer advice , though only at critical junctures . "
Short , president of the Commonwealth Chess Association , added : " In San Luis I observed that Danailov sat close to Topalov during play .
His not infrequent entering and exiting the hall would have provided opportunities for receiving communication from a third party . "

Meanwhile Veselin Topalov 's manager Silvio Danailov has reacted to the FIDE announcement rejecting the two million dollar challenge made by the Bulgarians for a match against Kramnik in the coming weeks .
International News , Belgrade ( 29.01.07 )
Silvio Danailov , Topalov 's manager , announced that they are going to file a claim against FIDE for refusing to organise a rematch between Topalov and Kramnik .
A rematch between Veselin Topalov and Vladimir Kramnik will not take place according to FIDE 's President Kirsan Ilyumzhinov .
" We will take this to the Lausanne Court of Arbitration for Sport , " Silvio Danailov announced for the BTA news agency .
" We will file a complaint as soon as we go through the decision of FIDE Presidential Board and see what their motives are , " he explained .
Topalov 's manager said that according to unconfirmed information FIDE have already organized a rematch between Topalov and Kramnik in secret whatever the outcome of the World Championship in Mexico .
" This is outrageous .
FIDE takes us back to the years of Satanism , " Silvio Danailov commented .
" They wo n't give us a rematch but we are allowed to take part in the World Championship in Mexico while Kramnik is guaranteed a rematch whatever the outcome , " Danailov said .
" We are not afraid because everything was done according to the law , " FIDE 's President Kirsan Ilyumzhinov replied .

Yesterday we had a frozen waterfall in Estonia , today there is something else frozen from this small country , hard to say what is it for sure .
Some say it might be that waterfall from outside , some say it ’s a monument to frozen jelly - fishes or Chtulhus .
Still those guys enjoy to be shot with this thing in the background , and the thing itself looks pretty interesting , minding that fact that it is located somewhere inside the forest .
THE CIRCUMCISION REFERENCE LIBRARY
The effect of male circumcision on the sexual enjoyment of the female partner
CIRP note :
The authors of this article have written a book entitled Sex As Nature Intended It .
The book has a website at www.sexasnatureintendedit.com.
Introduction
Male circumcision , the most commonly performed surgery in the USA , removes 33 - 50 % of the penile skin , as well as nearly all of the penile fine touch neuroreceptors [ 1 ] .
To date no study has investigated whether this dramatic alteration in the male genitalia affects the sexual pleasure experienced by the female partner or whether a woman can physically discern the difference between a penis with a foreskin .
The impact that male circumcision has on the overall sexual experience for either partner is unknown .
Just as female circumcision was advocated in some Muslim and African countries to control women 's sexuality , so too was male circumcision introduced into English - speaking countries in the late 1800s as a method of treating and preventing masturbation [ 2 ] .
While there has been debate over whether circumcision affects the sexual sensations of the penis , there have been few relevant studies .
Four men circumcised in adulthood reported decreased sensitivity [ 3 ] .
Writing under a pseudonym , a physician circumcised as an adult argued that the loss of sensitivity he experienced was favourable , as it gave him more control over his orgasms [ 4 ] .
Another man circumcised as an adult lamented that the decrease in sensation could be equated with seeing in monochrome rather than in colour .
Laumann et al. [ 5 ] found that circumcised men had different sexual practices from genitally altered men .
Circumcised men were more likely to masturbate , to engage in heterosexual anal and oral sex , and to engage in homosexual anal sex .
In the male rat , removal of the penile sheath markedly interferes with normal penile reflexes and copulation .
When circumcised rats were paired with sexually experienced females , they had more difficulty obtaining an erection , more difficulty inserting the penis into the vagina , and required more mounts to inseminate than did unaltered males [ 6 ] .
Preputial secretions in mice and rats are a strong attractant for female mice and rats [ 7 - 11 ] , and may provoke the onset of oestrus in mature females [ 12 ] .
There may be a histological explanation for these findings .
The tip of the foreskin , and some or all of the frenulum , are routinely removed as part of circumcision .
This tissue contains a high concentration of the nerve endings that sense fine touch [ 1 ] .
After circumcision , the surface of the glans thickens like a callus .
The glans is innervated by free nerve endings that can only sense deep pressure and pain . [ 13 ] .
Over 30 years ago , Masters and Johnson , using undocumented methodology , tested the sensitivity of the glans in men with and without foreskins and found no difference [ 14 ] .
The absence of fine - touch receptors in the glans could explain their findings , as Masters and Johnson may have been measuring the wrong variable .
Without knowing what was measured or how , these results constitute little more than anecdotal evidence .
A study from Iowa in the late 1980s [ 15 ] found that young mothers ( who had recently given birth to sons ) preferred intercourse with a circumcised man ; however , the importance of this study is compromised , as only 16.5 % of the women surveyed had sexual experience with both circumcised and intact men .
The study results may reflect the tendency of people to choose the familiar and shun the unfamiliar .
In a survey conducted on the Internet , circumcised men were significantly more likely to use additional artificial lubricants during sexual activity ( odds ratio , OR = 5.64 , 95 % CI = 3.65 - 8.71 ) [ 16 ] .
The 12th century physician and rabbi Moses Maimonides advocated male circumcision for its ability to curb a man 's sexual appetite [ 17 ] .
Further , he implied that it could also affect a woman 's sexuality , indicating that once a woman had taken a lover who was not circumcised , it was very hard for her to give him up .
The impact of male circumcision on the sexual pleasure experienced by both males and females is largely unstudied .
While the brain is often cited as the primary ' sexual ' organ , what impact does surgical alteration of the male genitalia have for both partners ?
Based on anecdotal reports , a survey was developed to determine the effect of male circumcision on a woman 's ability to achieve vaginal orgasm ( both single and multiple ) , to maintain adequate vaginal secretions , to develop vaginal discomfort , to enjoy coitus and to develop an intimate relationship with her partner .
This review presents the findings of a survey of women who have had sexual partners both with and without foreskins , and reports their experiences .
Methods
Women having sexual experience with both circumcised and anatomically complete partners were recruited through classified advertisements in magazines and an announcement in an anti-circumcision newletter .
Respondents to the advertisements were mailed a survey to complete and return , the comments then compiled and the responses analysed statistically .
The survey is continuing and this article reports the preliminary results .
Of the 284 surveys , 139 were completed and returned ; no attempts were made to characterize the demographic details of those who did not respond .
The women completing the surveys were aware that their responses and comments could later be published anonymously in a forthcoming book .
The survey included 40 questions ; the results were analysed for age , number of lifetime partners , preputial status of the most recent partner , preference for vaginal orgasms ( as defined below ) and their preference for a circumcised or intact penis .
Multiple choice answers were assigned numeric values , i.e. ' increased ' , ' stayed about the same ' and ' lessened ' of 1,0 , and - 1 respectively .
Likewise , questions with answers of ' mostly yes ' , ' mostly no ' , ' rarely ' and ' never ' were assigned values of 3 , 2 , 1 and 0 .
The survey defined ' vaginal orgasm ' as 'an orgasm that occurs during intercourse , brought about by your partner 's penis and pelvic movements and body contact , along with your own body 's pelvic movements , with no simultaneous stimulation of the clitoris by the hands ' .
Premature ejaculation was defined as the man ' usually ( 50 - 100 % of the time ) has had his orgasm within 2 - 3 minutes after insertion ' .
The survey included three sets of responses for the respondents to rate their sexual experiences with their circumcised and unaltered male partners ; the questions and possible responses are listed in Appendix 1 .
Comparisons between responses are expressed as the OR and 95 % CI .
Results
CIRP Note :
The results of this survey are somewhat obscurely stated .
This survey surveyed 138 women .
Of that group 20 ( 14.5 % ) preferred non-intact circumcised sexual partners while 118 or ( 85.5 % ) preferred intact non-circumcised sexual partners .
This means that about 6 out of 7 women preferred intact non-circumcised partners while about 1 out of seven preferred non-intact circumcised partners .
Of the 139 surveys returned , one considered a man who was undergoing foreskin restoration as having a foreskin ; this survey was excluded from analysis .
Not all questions were answered by all respondents .
Contradictory answers showed that not all respondents understood the questions ; the responses and unanswered questions were excluded from the analysis .
The demographic profile of the respondents is shown in Table 1 .
Table 1
The demographics of the respondents Variable Mean / median number Mean ( SD ) age ( years ) 37.3 ( 9.2 ) Number of partners ; Mean ( SD ) 14.7 ( 11.2 ) Median ( SD ) Preferred vaginal orgasm 71 Preferred position for attaining vaginal orgasm ; woman on top 54 man on top 54 rear entry 4 no preference 9
Comparisons of experiences with circumcised or intact males are shown in tables 2 and 3 .
With their circumcised partners , women were more likely not to have a vaginal orgasm ( 4.62 , 3.69 - 5.80 ) .
Conversely , women were more likely to have a vaginal orgasm with an unaltered partner .
Their circumcised partners were more likely to have premature ejaculation ( 1.82 , 1.45 - 2.27 ) .
Women were also more likely to state that they had had vaginal discomfort with a circumcised partner either often ( 19.89 , 5.98-66.22 ) or occasionally ( 7.00 , 3.83 -12.79 ) as opposed to rarely or never .
More women reported that they never achieved orgasm with circumcised partners ( 2.25 , 1.13 - 4.50 ) than with their unaltered partners .
Also , they were more likely to report never having had a multiple orgasm with their circumcised partners ( 2.25 , 1.13 - 4.50 ) .
They were also more likely to report never having had a multiple orgasm with their circumcised partners ( 2.22 , 1.36 - 3.63 ) .
They were also more likely to report that vaginal secretions lessened as coitus progressed with their circumcised partners ( 16.75 , 6.88-40.77 ) .
During prolonged intercourse with their circumcised partners , women were less likely to ' really get into it ' and more likely to ' want to get it over with ' ( 23.32 , 11.24-48.39 ) .
On the other hand , with their unaltered partners , the reverse was true , they were less likely to ' want to get it over with ' and considerably more likely to ' really get into it . '
When the women were divided into those older or younger than 40 years , the older women were more likely to rate their frequency of orgasm as higher with an unaltered partner ( Z=2.04 , P=0.02 ) .
Women 29 years or younger were more likely to prefer orally induced orgasms ( 2.61 , 1.14 - 5.97 ) , while women over 40 years preferred vaginally induced orgasms more than those aged < 29 years ( 3.00 , 1.16 - 7.32 ) .
The older women also had more lifetime unaltered partners ( Z=2.95 , P=0.002 ) .
This may have reflected the decreased availability of unaltered men of similar age for the younger women .
When the women were divided into those with more or fewer than 10 lifetime partners , those with > 10 were more likely to have orgasms with their circumcised partners than those with fewer partners , but still less frequent orgasms than they had with their unaltered partners .
Women who preferred a circumcised partner overall were more likely to have had < 10 partners ( 3.52 , 0.92-13.50 ) .

When women who preferred vaginal orgasm were compared with those preferring orally or manually induced orgasm , the former rated unaltered men higher ( Z=2.12 , P=0.016 ) , had more positive post - coital feelings ( Set 3 ; Z=2.68 , P=0.003 ) with their unaltered partners , and rated these men higher overall ( Z=2.12 , P=0.016 ) .
These women were more likely to prefer being on top during coitus to achieve vaginal orgasm ( 2.46 , 1.21-4.98 ) .
They were also more likely to have an unaltered man as their most recent partner ( 1.74 , 0.87-3.47 ) .
The women who preferred circumcised partners ( as elicited in one of three questions , n=20 ) were more likely to have had their first orgasm with a circumcised partner ( 8.38 , 2.88-24.35 ) than those who preferred unaltered partners .
Although these women preferred circumcised partners , they still found unaltered partners to evoke more vaginal fluid production , a lower vaginal discomfort rating and fewer complaints ( Sets 1 and 2 , Table 3 ) during intercourse than their circumcised partners .
In women who preferred circumcised men , there was no difference in their comparison of circumcised and unaltered men other than overall rating and a higher rate of premature ejaculation in their unaltered partners ( 4.63 , 2.36 - 9.07 )
These women had fewered unaltered partners ( 2.47 vs. 3.78 , Z= - 1.68 , P=0.045 ) , which suggests that their limited exposure to unaltered men may have been a consequence of ' premature ejaculation ' .
The inability to detect a difference in orgasm frequency , coital duration , coital complaints or satisfaction , and ' yet to formulate a preference ' , suggests that factors of conformity may be influential .
When women were grouped based on the preputial status of their most recent partner , women with unaltered partners had a higher rate of orgasms with them , at a mean ( SEM ) of 70 ( 31 % ) vs 56 ( 40 % ) ( Z=2.28 , P=0.01 ) .
They were more likely to rate circumcised partners lower ( Z= - 2.61 , P0.0047 ) and unaltered partners higher ( Z=2.83 , P=0.002 ) .
When only women whose most recent partner was circumcised , the results were consistent with the results from the entire study population .
Discussion
These results show clearly that women preferred vaginal intercourse with an anatomically complete penis over that with a circumcised penis ; there may be many reasons for this .
When the anatomically complete penis thrusts in the vagina , it does not slide , but rather glides on its own ' bedding ' of movable skin , in much the same way that a turtle 's neck glides in and out of the folder layers of skin surrounding it .
The underlying corpus cavernosa and corpus spongiosum slide within the penile skin , while the skin juxtaposed agaist the vaginal wall moves very little .
This sheath - within - a - sheath alignment allows penile movement , and vaginal and penile stimulation , with minimal friction or loss of secretions .
When the penile shaft is withdrawn slightly from the vagina , the foreskin bunches up behind the corona in a manner that allows the tip of the foreskin which contains the highest density of fine - touch neuroreceptors in the penis [ 1 ] to contact the corona of the glans which has the highest concentration of fine - touch receptors on the glans [ 18 ] .
This intense stimulation discourages the penile shaft from further withdrawal , explaining the short thrusting style that women noted in their unaltered partners .
This juxtapostion of sensitive neuroreceptors is also seen in the clitoris and clitoral hood of the Rhesus monkey [ 19 ] and in the human clitoris [ 18 ] .

As stated , circumcision removes 33 - 50 % of the penile skin .
With this skin missing , there is less tissue for the swollen corpus cavernosa and corpus spongiosum to slide against .
Instead the skin of the circumcised penis rubs against the vaginal wall , increasing friction , abrasion and the need for artificial lubrication .
Because of the tight penile skin , the corona of the glans , which is configured as a one - way valve pulls the vaginal secretions from the vagina when the shaft is withdrawn .
Unlike the anatomically complete penis , there is no sensory input to limit withdrawal .
Because the vast majority of the fine - touch receptors are missing from the circumcised penis , their role as ejaculatory triggers is also absent .
The loss of these receptors creates an imbalance between the deep pressure sensed in the glans , corpus cavernosa and corpus spongiosum and the missing fine touch [ 20 ] .
To compensate for the imbalance , to achieve orgasm , the circumcised man must stimulate the glans , corpus cavernosa , and corpus spongiosum by thrusting deeply in and out of the vagina .
As a result , coitus with a circumcised partner reduces the amount of vaginal secretions in the vagina , and decreases continual stimulation of the mons pubis and clitoris .
Respondents overwhelmingly concurred that the mechanics of coitus was different for the two groups of men .
Of the women , 73 % reported that circumcised men tend to thrust harder and deeper , using elongated strokes , while unaltered men by comparison tended to thrust more gently , to have shorter thrusts , and tended to be in contact with the mons pubis and clitoris more , according to 71 % of the respondents .
The responses in Sets 1 , 2 and 3 ( Table 3 ) are more a measure of intimacy than physical differences in thrusting patterns .
While some of the respondents commented that they thought the differences were in the men , not the type of penis , the consistency with which women felt more intimate with their unaltered partners is striking .
Some respondents reported that the foreskin improved their sexual satisfaction , which improved the quality of the relationship .
In addition to the observations of Maimonides in the 12th century , one survey found that marital longevity was increased when the male had a foreskin [ 21 ] .
Why the presence of the foreskin enhances intimacy needs further exploration .
When this information is compared with that collected by Laumann et al . [ 22 ] in the same period the women in the present survey had more lifetime partners ( a median of 2 and 10 respectively ) .
When the women with one partner in the former study were excluded ( because having sexual experience with both a circumcised partner and an unaltered partner necessitates at least two partners ) , the women in the present survey were more likely to have had > 4 partners ( 7.26 , 4.46-11.83 ) , >10 partners ( 5.83 , 4.02 - 8.48 ) , and > 20 partners ( 4.16 , 2.48-6.98 ) .
The high incidence of lifetime partners is a consequence of the inclusion criteria for the present study .
If a woman were to randomly find partners among American sexually active males , 70 - 90 % of whom are circumcised , 3 - 7 partners would be needed for a woman to have an even chance of having had both a circumcised and unaltered male partner .
However , women do not procure their sexual partners randomly .
Most sexual partners are found within a fairly close social network [ 22 ] .
Likewise , circumcision does not occur randomly ; within some of these networks , circumcision rates can approach 100 % .
For a woman to have a sexual partner with an anatomically complete penis involves having partners outside her immediate social network , which is uncommon .
For these reasons , a median number of partners of 10 is not unexpected .
While this study shows clearly that women prefer the surgically unaltered penis , it does have shortcomings .
The respondents were not selected randomly and several were recruited using a newsletter of an anti-circumcision organization .
However , when the responses from respondents gathered from the mailing list of the anti-circumcision organization were compared with those of the other respondents , there were no differences .
This selection bias may be compensated to the degree that each respondent acted as her own control , using her subjective criteria on both types of penises .
The findings cannot be completely attributed to selection bias .
In asking women to evaluate their experience based on all of their lifetime sexual partners , there may be an element of recall bias , but the circumcision status of the most current sexual partner did not alter the findings .
Because the surveys were not completed ' face - to - face ' , not all questions were completed by all respondents .
There were also several other questions that were misunderstood by the respondents , but these were only a very small proportion of the respondents .
Women who preferred vaginal orgasms had a strong preference for unaltered partners .
Women who preferred circumcised partners were half as likely to prefer vaginal orgasms , but there were too few women preferring circumcised partners to make any valid statistical claims .
This would suggest that the foreskin makes the most positive impact during vaginal intercourse .
Another weakness of the survey is its preoccupation with vaginal intercourse .
Several respondents commented that the foreskin also makes a difference in foreplay and fellatio .
Although this was not directly measured , some respondents commented that unaltered men appeared to enjoy coitus more than their circumcised couterparts .
The lower rates of fellatio , masturbation and anal sex among unaltered men [ 5 ] suggests that unaltered men may find coitus more satisfying [ 20 ] .
Clearly , the anatomically complete penis offers a more rewarding experience for the female partner during coitus .
While this study has some obvious methodological flaws , all the differences cannot be attributed to them .
It is important that these findings be confirmed by a prospective study of a randomly selected population of women with experience with both types of men .
It would be useful to examine the role of the foreskin in other sexual activities .
Because these findings are of interest , the negative effect of circumcision on the sexual enjoyment of the female partner needs to be part of any discussions providing ' informed consent ' before circumcision .

March 20 , 2007  -- McDonald's U.K. has launched a campaign to get British dictionary publishers to revise their definitions of " McJob . "
According to the Oxford English Dictionary , a " McJob " is " an unstimulating , low - paid job with few prospects , especially one created by the expansion of the service sector . "
" It 's the complete opposite to that , " Amanda Pierce , McDonald 's spokesperson and employee of 15 years , told ABC News .
" It 's stimulating , rewarding and offers a wide range of opportunities .
All the skills I have learned at McDonald 's will last me a lifetime , " Pierce said .
Pierce , who started on the shop floor of McDonald 's and now works for the McDonald 's U.K. head office , is a shining example of the career path that the American fast food chain can offer its U.K. employees .
" The McJob is n't what you think it is , " she said .
In May , McDonald 's will begin offering its employees the opportunity to sign a petition to turn the expression into something more positive in the hopes of changing the way people see McDonald 's jobs .
The company will gather as many signatures as possible before submitting the request to dictionary publishing houses .
It has a hard task ahead , as McJob has entered not only the dictionary but the British and American vocabulary .
On both sides of the Atlantic , it means a low - paying job with few prospects .
First used in the United States in the 1980s , the word was popularized by Douglas Coupland 's 1991 book " Generation X . "
Today , McDonald 's jobs are often considered decent gigs for high school dropouts or temporary jobs for students paying off loans .
And at home , parents warn their children :
If you do n't study hard , you 'll end up working at McDonald's .
But the McDonald 's publicity machine is trying to work the Mc-expression to its advantage .
Last year , as part of its employer - branding strategy to woo the best staff , it displayed posters with the slogan " McProspects -- over half of our executive team started in our restaurants .
Not bad for a McJob . "
Ever since his catastrophic retreat from Moscow , the terrible losses suffered by Napoleon 's soldiers have been blamed on hunger and the biting cold of the Russian winter .
But according to new research by French scientists , the fabled Grande Armée , reduced to 30,000 men by December 1812 from a total of 600,000 - 700,000 just six months earlier , was actually felled by parasites .
Researchers led by Didier Raoult of the National Scientific Research Centre in Marseille have analysed the DNA of 72 teeth extracted from 35 skeletons removed from a mass military grave near Vilnius , in present - day Lithuania , in 1995 .
They found minute traces of the microbes associated with typhus and trench fever , deadly diseases transmitted by fleas and lice , in the dental matter of 10 Napoleonic soldiers , the newspaper Le Figaro reported yesterday .
The scientists confirmed the typhus hypothesis by identifying the remains of three fleas in 5 kg of soil and human remnants taken from the grave , in the grounds of a former army camp that was occupied in turn by Tsarist forces , Hitler 's invading troops and finally the Soviet army .
" We are confident in this diagnosis , " one of the team , Pierre - Edouard Fournier , told the paper .
" Cold and hunger certainly claimed many victims , but diseases greatly increased the toll . "
The Grande Armée , at 691,000 men the largest fighting force assembled in Europe , crossed the river Neman in Lithuania on June 23 1812 , and began its long march towards Moscow .
Meeting only sporadic resistance , Napoleon reached his objective in early September .
The invaders found Moscow empty of people and supplies , and much of the city immediately went up in flames in what is assumed to be sabotage by Russian fighters .
The Corsican - born emperor abandoned the ruined city - without ever receiving the formal surrender of the Russian army - on October 19 .
It immediately became clear that his retreat was going to be one of the most celebrated military debacles in history .
Constantly harrassed by Russian forces , including the fearsome Cossacks , and forced to take the same scorched road west on which it had earlier moved east , the French army soon lost almost all its horses and had to continue the harrowing withdrawal on foot .
Until now , it has been assumed that the Russian winter in effect finished the job , killing hundreds of thousands through frostbite , hunger and exhaustion .
But according to the scientists , the conditions of the retreat favoured a mass infestation by lice and fleas .
Mr Schroeder is taking a huge political gamble , say analysts
Mr Schroeder had urged deputies to vote his government down , so he could seek a new mandate for controversial reforms .
President Horst Koehler must now decide if there are grounds to call elections a year ahead of the original schedule .
An early election is expected to hand power to the conservative Christian Democrats ( CDU ) .
SCHROEDER'S VOTE RESULT Against - 296 For - 151 Abstained - 148
Profile : Gerhard Schroeder
After Friday 's Bundestag vote Mr Schroeder met President Koehler to request a dissolution of parliament .
CDU leader Angela Merkel told the Bundestag that Mr Schroeder 's SPD - Green coalition " can no longer govern " .
Pressure for polls
Polls show 70 % of Germans want early elections , which would probably be held on 18 September .
Mr Schroeder pointed out in his speech that all Germany 's parties wanted early elections .
He said his government now had a diminished capacity to act after a string of defeats in regional elections .
" Without a new mandate my political programme cannot be carried forward , " he said .
Some experts questioned whether Mr Schroeder 's confidence vote move was constitutional .
Many MPs from among Mr Schroeder 's own Social Democrats and his Green Party coalition allies opposed the move .
But when it came to the vote in the Bundestag ( lower house ) , 151 members backed the government , 296 voted against and 148 abstained .
Economic woes
The loss of North Rhine - Westphalia - including the industrial Ruhr region - was seen as a crushing blow to the already wounded chancellor .
" The bitter result ... jeopardises the political basis for the continuation of our task , " Mr Schroeder said at the time .
With a 17 % lead in opinion polls , CDU politicians are eager for early elections and a win that would make Ms Merkel Germany 's first female leader .
" There will be new elections in Germany .
This means a change in the content and style of politics , " said Christian Wulff , Lower Saxony 's conservative prime minister and Germany 's most popular politician .
" Then the hard work will begin .
Our leader , Angela Merkel , will carry out the kind of economic reforms that were implemented in Britain over the last 15 years . "
Mr Schroeder 's government has lost much support because of Germany 's poor economic performance and the unpopular reforms it has pushed through .
Above all , voters appear to be fed up with the government 's inability to bring down Germany 's high unemployment rate of 11.3 % - some 4.7 million people , according to the latest figures .
Although I 've been dismissive of build servers in the past , I 've increasingly come to believe that the build server is critical -- it 's the heart monitor of your software project .
It can tell you when your project is healthy , and it can give you advance warning when your project is about to flatline .
You should start out with a simple pulse -- whether or not your project builds , and how often you 're building it .
The build server can be so much more , though .
The Zutubi article The Path to Build Enlightenment provides a great overview of what a build server can do for your project :
Machine independence Let 's get past " It runs on my machine " first .
The build server retrieves everything from source control , and builds on a machine untainted by developer dependencies .
It forces an integration point for all the developers working on the project , in a neutral , indifferent way .
You can hate your co-workers , but it 's irrational to hate the build server .
Scripted Builds
Your build process is now clearly defined by a script and under source control .
You might say it 's almost .. self - documenting .
Is n't that the way it should be ?
Scripted tests
Sure , maybe all the code compiles .
But does the software actually work ?
The build server is a logical place to integrate some basic tests to see if your product is doing what it 's supposed to do .
Mere compilation is not enough .
The more tests you accrete into the build over time , the better the feedback is from the build , and the more valuable it will be to your project .
It 's a positive reinforcement cycle .
Daily and Weekly builds
Once you have the build server set up , you 'll establish a rhythm for your project , where you 're building regularly .
When something breaks , you 'll know , and quickly .
A solid heartbeat from the build server leads to a confident development team .
Continuous Integration
This is the holy grail of build server integration -- doing a complete build every time something is checked into source control .
Once you 've gotten your feet wet with weekly and daily builds , it 's the next logical step .
It also forces you to keep your test and build times reasonable so things can proceed quickly .
Automated releases
The build server automates all the drudge work associated with releasing software .
It .. labels the source code with the build number creates a uniquely named drop folder for that particular build tags the binaries with the build number in the file metadata creates installation packages and installers publishes the installs to websites , FTP sites , or file paths
A well - designed , fully - automated build process makes it trivially easy for anyone to get a particular release , or to go back in time to a previous release .
And it 's less work for you when the build machine does it .
Building in multiple environments
For advanced projects only .
If you have to test your code against 10 different languages , or different variants of an operating system , consider integrating those tests into the build process .
It 's painful , but so is that much ad - hoc testing .
Static and Dynamic Analysis
There 's an entire universe of analysis tools that you can run on your code during the build to produce the wall of metrics .
FxCop , nDepends , LibCheck , and so forth .
There are lots of metrics , and only you and your team can decide what 's important to you .
But some of these metrics are really clutch .
At the very least , you 'll want to know how much code churn you have for each build .
If you do n't have a build server on your project , what are you waiting for ?

Villagers have vowed not to move
The Egyptian government is determined to move the 3,200 families of the village to an alternative settlement it has built a few kilometres away .
Officials say emptying out the village will enable them to explore the tombs and to protect them from water damage .
An official ceremony was held and the bulldozers moved in .
They demolished four uninhabited mud brick houses in the village of Qurna , very near the Valley of the Kings in Luxor .
Many villagers have already left to the new settlement of Taref built by the Egyptian government at a cost of $ 31 m ( £ 15.6 m ) .
Qurna sits above dozens of ancient Egyptian tombs , part of the huge necropolis of Thebes on the west bank of Luxor .
Valuables sold
Over the years , the villagers are believed to have dug many of the tombs under their houses and to have sold much of what was in them .
But officials say now they will be able to further explore the tombs and to protect them from water damage coming from the village .
The government has wanted to move the Qurnawis for 60 years but it is only now that it has completed an alternative village for them .
Many villagers , however , complained that the new houses are too small for their families and that they are being cut off from their fields and their livelihoods in the tourist trade .
The governor of Luxor says it will take a month and a half to demolish the village but some Qurnawis insist they will not leave .

Two more words that might change your life ( or at least your lunch hour ) »
How to be better at almost anything
Earlier we talked about why the fast - talking guy sounds smarter than the guy who understands more than he can say .
We talked about how wrong that is , and how if the glib always win , we all lose .
But the more important battle is not between articulate vs. less - articulate people ... it 's between the articulate vs. non-articulate parts of your own head .
Your brain has both a quick - talker and a quick - thinker , but the good - talker " know - it - all " gets the glory .
In other words , there 's a smart part and a dumb part of your brain , and the problem is ... the dumb part talks .
If we can get the dumber part to STFU , we can learn much faster and perform much better at just about anything .
The dumber chatty part is hurting us .
It 's the part that makes you self - conscious :
" Do I look OK ?
Am I going to say something stupid ? "
" Am I overlooking something in this code ? "
It 's the part that criticizes :
" DOH !
I can't believe I just did that .
Idiot ! "
" This code is inefficient ... you need to fix it . "
" That paragraph reads like a six - year old wrote it .
It 's dull .
It 's the part that gives you " helpful " instructions :
" Make eye contact for three seconds .
Watch your posture , do n't look at your slides . "
" Look for a design pattern to apply .
Do n't duplicate that code over there . "
" Stay close to the fall - line .
Do n't lock your knees .
Turn quicker ! "
" It 's safer to use formal terminology than risk looking silly . "
While your brain is chatting away evaluating , judging , instructing , criticizing , directing , etc ... the smarter parts sit in the corner , ignored .
Alan Kay -- often called the father of object - oriented programming and one of the greatest thinkers / researchers / designers / teachers / engineers of our time -- talks about the implications of this for education ... something we talked about earlier .
But Alan Kay was inspired by the work of Tim Gallwey , whose work arose from one simple question , " ... is all this inner dialogue really necessary ?
Is it helping ... or is it getting in the way ? "
Until I heard Alan Kay talk about it ( and explain some of the cognitive science behind it ) , I had always thought Gallwey 's " inner game " thing was just one more bit of 60's self - help new - age nonsense .
I was dead wrong .
Gallwey showed that the parts of our brain that learn from experience are far more capable than the parts that learn from talking through it .
We think we need to tell ourselves things like , " keep your weight over your front do n't press so hard on the violin bow ... " when we 're trying to learn something new or improve our performance , when that 's exactly the thing that inhibits learning and improvement .
We did learn to walk , after all .
And we did it with virtually no explicit " talking " instruction .
Nobody compared our first steps to the steps of an expert ( i.e. a parent ) and " told " us how to adjust .
Nobody outside or inside our head was evaluating , judging , or correcting .
Think about times when people are telling you what to do when you 're trying to concentrate and you finally yell at them to STFU .
All we need to do is take that attitude we have to people outside our head and apply it to the chattering inside our head .
Easier said than done , of course .
Gallwey makes the point that most of us can't turn off the talking parts with brute force will , although that 's the basis for so many ineffective self - help or creativity books that tell you to change the way you talk to yourself or " silence your inner critic " simply by telling yourself to do so .
( pretty tough to tell yourself not to tell yourself ... )
For Gallwey , the answer is focus of attention .
In tennis , for example , he has people learn to focus on the ball -- the seams turning , the way it bounces , and the moment at which someone hits it .
Bounce - hit .
Bounce - hit .
Nothing about feet , arms , rackets , weight shifts .
Nothing talking to -- or about - - you .
( Yes , technically your brain is still ' talking ' through this " here 's the bounce , there 's the hit , etc. " but the point is that it 's not annoying and influencing you . )
Example Techniques
* Art
Nobody does a better job of this than Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain , a program created by Betty Edwards .
I 'd recommend it to everyone whether you ever care about drawing or not , just for the way it changes your brain .
Betty ( and a zillion students ) demonstrate that the part of your brain that talks is also the part that draws like a three - year old .
That part talks its way through , say , what a car or horse or human looks like , and it does a really lame job .
But if you get your brain to stop saying , " this is a horse , and they have four legs and ... " and instead focus on seeing shapes and lines , the better - performing parts of your brain can kick in .
* Writing non-fiction
If you plan a book by making outlines , you 're indulging the talking ( linear , step - by - step , rational ) part of your brain .
The focus is on what you do and say and when and how you say it .
With our books , we do not use outlines -- we do everything from storyboards .
By focusing on the story of the learner 's journey , it keeps the brain focused on the learner 's experience rather than what WE do / say / write .
This is not a trivial thing -- last week our books represented 25 % of the O'Reilly Top 20 bestsellers .
And we 're not all that good at writing .
It really is about focusing on the reader instead of focusing on what the reader will think of us .
* Design
Mind - mapping -- if you do it quickly -- stops the talking parts from jumping in and evaluating what you 're writing , so the creative parts can do things .
That 's what makes mind - mapping so powerful and fun -- after you 're done , you look at the paper and find things you 'd never thought about ... things that would n't have come out while talking your way through an outline .
* Programming
Pay attention to Code Smells , which is another way of saying a gut " bad feeling " that tells you something is wrong even if you can't yet say why .
* Everything
Read Malcolm
Gladwell 's book Blink , which I talked about in this post .
And while you 're making sure that glib people do n't always win , try to do the same within your own brain .
Listen to the comments of our readers , who I 'm sure will have suggestions for other resources : )

Great post .
Made me think of a profound quote from Heidegger :
“ Thinking only begins at the point where we have come to
know that Reason , glorified for centuries , is the most obstinate adversary of thinking ”
As I have grown older I have tried to think more intuitively like Heidegger suggests .
You really have to teach yourself to not dismiss it - our reasoning brains , at least in the Western world are often the default , if you will , way of interfacing with the world of objects ( which unfortunately includes people ) .
Heidegger may not be accessible to many people but his ideas continue to amaze me .
Cheers

I tried to get the voices in my head to shut up , but they just got angry and shouted at me ! :-)
Another intriguing and thought provoking post .
I 'm not sure how I can apply it to programming , unless I already am without thinking about it .
I think the way I tend to program is let the " chatter " flow out onto the screen , and then go back and critically carve out the superfluous code that does n't add anything .
It 's the way I was originally taught to program ( although when I started , the critique was offered by a mentor ) , and it works well for me .

There 's a brilliant anthem to that " STFU - you - stupid - voice - in - my - head " .
It 's called " DIE VAMPIRE , DIE " from an off - Broadway musical called " [ title of show ] " .
In the third part of the song , they say , " Why is it , if some dude walked up to me on the subway platform and said these things , I 'd think he was a mentally ill asshole , but if the vampire inside my head says it , it 's the voice of reason ? "
Go to iTunes , type in " Die Vampire , Die " and pay the 99 cents .
It 's great to listen to whenever you need to silence those voices .

I teach my clients " mindfulness " so they can see ( feel ? ) their brain ' working ' : most people do n't even realize they have this inner dialogue .
The best part is when they can begin to get a handle on it , they can choose to shut it off , or make more efficient choices before being swayed by the chatter .
Of course , sometimes the chatter can be useful , but in many cases ( as Blink shows ) , the inner dialogue is simply second - guessing ourselves .
In physical movement ( like sports , dance , martial arts , etc ) , we call the non-chatter physical part : " kinesthetic sense " : a better way of describing this is " the body will know what to do [ as it has learned this already ] " .
Galway 's description of a baby walking falls under this , except the baby is using an ' evolutionary sense ' : the baby learns how to walk because walking is part of survival .
Additionally , this subject is also part of aethetics ( " we ca n't tell ourselves what is beautiful or appealing " ) , as well as a broad anthropological idea that " people learn better / deeper by doing something themselves , than by someone instructing them " .
Ever meet someone who almost refuses to take advice , preferring to discover on his / her own ?
It 's so frustrating for us outside of him / her , but he / she learns the lesson FAR more deeply ( and lasting ! ) than by anecdote !

That infernal internal dialogue .
Really useful at the right time , but unfortunately way too overused .
When you only have a hammer , everything looks like a nail .
I had breakfast the other day with friends who have an 8 month old child .
I was awed by the silence in her .
She was simply there , watching , learning and experiencing the world .
Of course , being 8 months old , she does not yet have the capability for any dialogue .
There are a few tools that can be easily explained to get control over this internal dialogue .
There are a whole bunch of other methods that take a lot more explanation that I can do here .
First method : Restate your internal dialogue immediately after hearing it .
This brings your internal dialogue under your conscious control by breaking the pattern .
Second method :
Move the location of your internal dialogue into your voice box .
Most people listen to their dialogue coming from a specific location .
Often from the back of their head and off to one side .
Move that location to where you physically speak from and it usually silences the chatter .
Third method :
Pick a personal mantra , then use it .
" Shut the hell up " is one such mantra . :-)
Forth method :
Not really a method , but helps understanding .
Who , when your internal dialogue is chattering away , are you speaking to ?
Enjoy ,

Posted by : greg carroll | Dec 11 , 2006 5:53:43 PM
I agree with what you say about the importance of the emotional side of the brain , even for language learning which is typically associated with the left or rational side .
Here is what I recently put on my blog on this subject .
“ I want to learn to speak English better .
I do not like to hear myself pronounce English .
I have trouble writing English .
I cannot remember my new English vocabulary .
I need to improve my English grammar .
I have trouble expressing my ideas in English .
When I am with native speakers I do not understand much of what they say . ”
These are some of the comments that often I hear from our new learners at The Linguist .
I had these feelings when I started studying languages .
So what is to be done ?
My answer is simple .
Make the language your friend .
In particular , make the words your friends .
Let the words be the focus of your learning .
Learn to like the words of English .
Put all your effort into words , how they sound , how they come together with other words , and all the different meanings they can have .
Be patient as you get to know these words .
They will be your friends for a long time .
Make sure you take the time to meet them often in your listening and reading .
Do not judge or criticize yourself .
Do not push yourself .
When you feel like listening , listen .
Choose content that you like .
It may be old familiar content or new content .
It may be easy content or difficult content .
Make sure you like it enough to listen .
Listen many times if you feel like it .
Listen only once if you feel like it .
Then choose something else .
Just follow your interests .
Listen as much as possible to content read by someone whose voice and intonation you like .
Imitate the voice and the intonation .
Stop the recorder from time to time and replay short sections and imitate the tone and accent .
The more you like the content and the voice , the easier it will be to imitate .
Read when you feel like reading .
Look at the words and phrases .
Notice them .
Focus on the ones you have trouble using .
Save them .
Learn to admire how these letters come together to convey so much meaning .
Enjoy the powerful feeling of making sense out of the words of a strange language .
Sense the joy of exploring another culture .
Try to feel that you are a part of that culture .
When you feel really energetic , try to review lists of words and phrases that you have come across in your listening and reading .
You should do this , not in the hope that you will remember them , but because know it will help you to get to know them , gradually .
When you get tired of reviewing words , you just go back to listening and reading .
Or you can take a rest .
Do not let anything frustrate you .
The happier you are , the more positive you feel about the language , the more easily you will be able to imitate the sounds of the language .
The less stress you feel , the more easily you will figure out the meaning directly , without translating into your language .
The more time you spend listening and reading , the sooner you will be able to express yourself in English in all situations .
And your pronunciation will improve .
Language learning really is that simple .
I know that this is true because I have done this for nine languages .
I am doing it know in order to learn Russian .

I blog internally for my company and I recently wrote a long post about making design decisions based on your " gut . "
I think the key to winning this argument with people is :
1 ) Convince people that your gut is actually your subconscious .
Then , convince them that the subconscious is this low energy , enormously powerful , honed - by - evolution snap decision making machine that produces advice in the form of urges or hunches by digesting 500 times the amount of input you can consciously handle .
It then , rather painlessly , gives you a simple , synthesized and distilled nudge in the right direction .
and / or
2 ) Be right all the time , for no apparent reason .
People like to model people who seem magically brilliant .
I make an unhealthy number of major design decisions for big global businesses and I really do trust my gut .
It never overthinks , it never underthinks .
It 's quite deterministic .
It gives you the best possible advice from every shred of evidence you 've encountered .
You just have to listen to it .
It wo n't always be right , but it will never be less right than you would , overall , with much more effort .

One of the attributes of achieving flow is that you lose the self consciousness that keeps distracting you .
I suggest reading Csikszentmihalyi's Flow : The Psychology of Optimal Experience .
He pioneered flow theory .
In his first book on the subject , Beyond Boredom and Anxiety : Experiencing Flow in Work and Play , he writes about the original research that he did on this subject .
He interviewed rock climbers , dancers , and surgeons to understand how they were able to order their minds and turn off the little voices that prevent us from achieving optimal experiences .
Posted by : Vanessa | Dec 11 , 2006 6:48:07 PM
I wonder how many have read , or heard of , Martin Buber .
About 100 years ago , he wrote of the importance of " being there " or " being present . "
And you can't " be there " and also know that you are " being there , " because as soon as you begin to think that " you 're there , " you 've actually stopped being there .
You can't be both meta and present at the same time .
I also wonder if George Lucas read him , and based the Jedi concept of being there on Buber 's writing .

Kathy ,
I often read your weblog with interest and admire you .
I get motivated by your wonderful articles .
I just wanted to point you to Jiddu Krishnamurthy .
One of his books " Awakening of Intelligence " was a very deep , marvelous reading .
You may want to see if you can read it .
Some info you can get here ( http://www.kfa.org/) and here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiddu_Krishnamurti on his " teachings " .
Thanks ,
Shiva

Context for my approach to this : Supposedly this is my Virgo - ness ... tendencies to be hypercritical , highly methodical , and super - detailed .
( These come in really handy if I 'm the one making shopping lists .
At one point I had it down to only 2 trips a year to a drugstore for a family of 4 - 6 . )
When I 'm doing something important , though , that involves more than a simple physical function , or drawing one basic line from A to B , I completely detach from any single movement or directed thought process .
The goal and result is smooth co-ordination and unity of concentration .
With complex processes that do require lots of planning , my method is to identify the components , put them in order if necessary , and then reduce it all to the barest skeleton .
The more complex the process , the better I 'll do it if I 've gone through the ' reduction ' first .
This works for a personality like mine , since my nature will insist on every detail and piece being filled in along the way .
The most effective people I 've worked with , not necessarily perfectionistic like me , each have their own individual ways of getting to the the same place , which is completely ' in ' the story we 're writing .
Some of it is confidence and un-selfconsciousness , but mostly it 's a way of totally focusing on what is happening .
Prepare beforehand as appropriate , then put it aside and go ' there ' .

Please , please , please , please , please share - how in the world do you storyboard a non-fiction book ?
I 'd LOVE to see that !
Do you just storyboard main ideas , and then focus writing on getting those main ideas out , do you storyboard outline points ( which would be odd , since you do n't outline ) , or something else entirely ?

Great post .
Of all the books I 've read in my life , Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain may be the most influential .
My grade 10 art teacher based our entire year around the book , and I was as amazed by it then as I am now .
The fact that you can drastically improve your skill at something simply by thinking about it differently is a very powerful idea .
Once you see what that can do to your drawing , you wonder what it might do for other areas of your life .
It 's one of the only books that I find myself referring to again and again in casual conversations .
My other vote is for Neil Postman 's " Teaching as a Subversive Activity " .
It advocates question - directed learning in the public schools , but the core message can apply to many other things .
Engaging the creative side of your brain to ask questions , rather than letting the logical side of your brain dictate answers , can be a very rewarding process .

Posted by : Norbert Klamann | Dec 12 , 2006 5:12:07 AM
FWIW , a technique that I use to shut up " the ugly little voice " is to write a dialog .
I think I got the idea from The Artist 's Way by Julia Cameron , which is another one of those change your life books like Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain .
The idea is that you just write down what the UGL says , and answer it .
Lots and lots of " Yeah , buts ... " when I do it , but eventually I can argue the stupid thing to a standstill .
And , PLEASE talk about storyboarding non-fiction .
Mind - mapping , yes , but I can only see storyboarding page layout , after the subject is down , so I 'm clearly missing something , and I suspect it 's something terribly important ...

Photography : Pay attention only to the negative space and its relationship to the edges of the frame .
People photography : Pay attention only to peak gestures , that is , when arms , legs , hands , mouth , eyes , etc. are most extended .
Press the shutter when those gestures serve your composition .
Do n't try to " capture " feelings , either yours or theirs .

Stimulating comments and article .
There is a joy of recognition .
Personally I refer to the inner voice as my rational part / my mind .
I consider the intuition part as my heart .
Listen to your heart , follow your heart , trust your gut feelings .
It 's all wonderful stuff and all based on this idea .
Posted by : Peter | Dec 12 , 2006 12:15:55 PM
Sometimes going with the gut feeling is the right way and sometimes it is just a total disaster .
That intuitive feeling that is the first flash of insight .
I believe but am far from sure that it fails most when I am working on something I do n't know enough about , but do have some familiarity with .
What I think I know , just is n't so .
So I have to remember to do some quick and dirty testing to make sure what I am doing is the right direction , if not the most correct way .
Just to make sure .
But I still get surprised sometimes when some bit of trivia jumps out of my brain , LIke yesterday when I had to guess who said " The happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts : therefore , guard
accordingly . " , I do n't remember anyone saying , yet I had a flash to say Marcus Aurelius , which is the right answer .

John Windsor : I 'm forever in your debt for sending me to iTunes for " Die Vampire , Die . "
Lauren : thanks for bringing up the relationship to aesthetics , and yes you 're so right -- the person learns the lesson far more deeply when they experience it themselves .
And just as it's frustrating when we can't get someone to listen , it can also be frustrating when the opposite happens -- someone insists you give them the shortcut and just * tell * them when you know they really need to do it .
Michael : " Shut the hell up " as a mantra ... works for me !

Vanessa :
Thanks for bringin up Flow -- it was one of two required reading books for the little division of Virgin I worked for ( the other was " Understanding Comics " ) , and I 've dog -eared just about every page over the years .
I consider putting people in " flow " to be the most significant thing that we can do for our users , which is why much of what we talk about here is how to help encourage , support , and not break flow .
Mitch : " You ca n't be both meta and present at the same time . "

No , I did n't know about Martin Buber .
Smart guy , though .
David Lee King and others : Storyboards , yes .
We get a lot of requests to talk more abut that , so I will .

But I promise to say much more about it .

James : " what if you 're a talker * and* a blink analyst ? "
I 'll try not to hate you . ; )
Steven H : What a GREAT recommendation on photography .
While most of us have probably heard the advice about negative space ( but do n't remember it enough to actually do it ) , it was a great reminder .
But the one on gestures -- looking at them just as more shapes rather than representations of " feelings " , that 's awesome .
Steven Fletcher : I have n't checked that out yet , but I already love the title .

Dubbed Project Darkstar , the Java - based software lets developers create a variety of games that can be accessed through a single - server framework .
Sun has been a supporter of online and mobile gaming , chief gaming officer , Chris Melissinos said .
And Project Darkstar will be an " important technology foundation in the exploding multiplayer online game marketplace . "
" By open sourcing Darkstar technology , we will help enable the widest possible market for online game developers and remove their burden of having to build enterprise - grade server solutions , " Melissinos said .
The company is expected to release more details about the project at the 2007 Game Developers Conference in San Francisco this week .
One such massive multiplayer online role - playing game ( MMORGP ) developer is NCsoft , which publishes City of Heroes , City of Villains , Lineage , and Guild Wars .
Chris Mayer , VP of product development for NCsoft , noted that Sun 's server software helped it prototype a new online game project internally .
" The Darkstar technology team proved very supportive and we were up and running quickly .
We very much appreciate Sun 's initial efforts in developing the kind of server technologies needed to jump - start online projects , " Mayer said .
While Sun has traditionally shied away from open - sourcing its software , the Darkstar project follows other Sun initiatives that are opening up to developers including Java itself .
Darkstar should become available under a GPL license in a few months .
In addition to the release of Project Darkstar , Sun also launched a companion , Darkstar Playground .
The goal is to let approved developers gain access to Sun 's server resources to start developing their online games .
Sign ups are going on now .
The project is expected to be live at the JavaOne conference in May 2007 .
SAN JOSE , Calif. , July 1 - Things are looking up at Wyse Technology , a venerable maker of computer terminals .
Unless , that is , you happen to want to work for the company here in Silicon Valley .
Responding to booming demand in Asia and in Europe , Wyse is adding new development teams in India and China and expanding its worldwide work force to about 380 , from 260 .
Its profits are recorded here -- but almost none of its new jobs .
Amid widespread signs of economic recovery in the region , Wyse is emblematic of its economy , in which demand , sales and profits are rising quickly while job growth continues to stagnate .
In the last three years , profits at the seven largest companies in Silicon Valley by market value have increased by an average of more than 500 percent while Santa Clara County employment has declined to 767,600 , from 787,200 .
During the previous economic recovery , between 1995 and 1997 , the county , which is the heart of Silicon Valley , added more than 82,800 jobs .

More On This
— North Carolina State University researchers are developing a system to convert animal fat into an alternative fuel .
The researchers have partnered with an Arizona - based energy company to produce a fuel they have dubbed Centia , which they said is the Latin equivalent of " green power .
"
Unlike ethanol and some other alternative fuels , Centia requires no fossil fuels in the production process , said Henry Lamb , an associate professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering .
" Our process would convert animal fat , lard for example , from pig processing into a usable fuel , " Lamb said .
" I grew up on a hog farm in Sampson County , so absolutely I 'm very familiar with hog production .
" Lamb said triglycerides are converted into fatty acids , which are treated in a reactor to produce hydrocarbons .
Bill Roberts , a professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering , said the process also would be more efficient for hog farmers .
" Animals that die on the farm , farmers typically pay to have them crated away and burned or buried .
We can use those and turn them into jet fuel , " Roberts said .
The researchers said they want to start at the top of the fuel chain with jets , then move their way down to biodiesel and eventually biofuel for cars .
More than 17 billion gallons of jet fuel are used in the U.S. each year .
The researcher said that , if they can replace that jet fuel with Centia , more crude oil would be available for gasoline production , which could lead to lower prices for drivers .
A gallon of unleaded regular gas in the Triangle costs $ 2.17 .
The researchers said they hope to have their first batch of Centia on the market in about a year and a half .
Outside of taxes and profits , we are a society used to thinking in gross terms .
But the net is what we get to use .
Net energy is how much energy is left for productive purposes after the energy needed to find , concentrate and deliver its energy services are subtracted .
Net energy analysis , ( and its subset EROI ) get alot of airtime in peak oil discussions .
If the world is running on a certain total energy surplus , what are the implications for a decline in this surplus ?
Will the market , via dollars , anticipate or obviate a future constrained by biophysical limits ?
There seems to be much disagreement as to how best to use EROI and net energy principles , if at all , in tackling what we perceive on the horizon as a looming energy crisis .
In this piece , Dr. Cleveland gives and overview of the central tenets of net energy analysis , in a broader perspective that we are used to on this site .
This is a guest post from Cutler Cleveland .
Theoildrum.com previously highlighted Dr. Clevelands work on the Energy Return from Wind .
Todays post is Professor Clevelands latest installment on net energy analysis at the Encyclopedia of Earth , which I have reformatted to theoildrum .
The Encyclopedia of Earth , where Prof . Cleveland is an editor / director , has made amazing progress in its short history attempting to become an academic / content based web clearinghouse for information on earth and our environment .
I encourage everyone to follow some of the hyperlinks in the below story and peruse that site .
Introduction
Energy return on investment ( EROI ) is the ratio of the energy extracted or delivered by a process to the energy used directly and indirectly in that process .
A common related term is energy surplus , which is the gross amount of energy extracted or delivered , minus the energy used directly and indirectly in that process .
EROI is a dimensionless number , while energy surplus refers to an actual physical quantity of energy .
Suppose an energy delivery system delivers 10 joules of energy , but in the process consumes 2 joules .
The EROI for that process is 5 ( 10 divided by 2 ) , while the energy surplus delivered is 8 joules ( 10 minus 2 ) .
EROI is a tool of net energy analysis , a methodology that seeks to compare the amount of energy delivered to society by a technology to the total energy required to find , extract , process , deliver , and otherwise upgrade that energy to a socially useful form .
Net energy analysis was developed in response to the emergence of energy as an important economic , technological and geopolitical force following the energy price increases of 1973 - 74 and 1980 - 81 .
Interest in net energy analysis was rekindled in recent years following another round of energy price increases , growing concern about energy 's role in climate change , and the debate surrounding the remaining lifetime of conventional fossil fuels , especially crude oil .
The principles
1 . Net energy and energy surplus are important driving forces in ecology and economic systems
The efficiency and effectiveness of energy capture is a central organizing principle in ecology .
Living organisms must capture energy and allocate it among a number of life - sustaining tasks ( growth , reproduction , energy storage , defense , competition ) .
A larger surplus produced by a system of energy capture compared to competing strategies gives an organism a competitive advantage .
Ecologists have used the principle of net energy to explain a wide range of phenomena , including habitat switching , long distance migration by birds , vertical migration by marine organisms , optimal foraging strategy , the pattern of the distribution and abundance of species , reproductive behavior in bats , and the effects of human disturbance on organisms .
Biologists such as Alred Lotka and Howard Odum elevated the concept to the driving force behind natural selection itself , where , in the struggle for existence , the advantage goes to those organisms whose energy - capturing devices are more effective in directing available energies into channels favorable to the preservation of the species .
Scholars from a number of disciplines have applied the same concept of net energy to social systems , with widely varying assumptions about the extent to which net energy influences the trajectory of the evolution of culture .
The analogy to natural systems is straightforward : societies with access to energy sources with a higher EROI and a large net energy surplus have an economic and military advantage over societies that use lower quality energy sources .
A low EROI means that more of a society ’s productive resources must be devoted to energy delivery , and thus can not be used to produce non-energy goods and services , support a powerful military , expand the arts , or be consumed as leisure time .
Net energy has been used to explain major energy transitions , including the industrial revolution and the emergence of the affluent society , the rise and fall of great civilizations , the pattern of resource depletion , and the impact of technological change on energy technologies .
Net energy has been used as a methodological tool to assess and compare energy systems , as a tool to assess the climate impact of energy technologies , and it plays a central role in the longstanding debate on the viability of alternative energy technologies such as ethanol .
2 . The size and rate of delivery of surplus energy is just as important as EROI
The net amount of energy delivered from the energy sector to the non-energy sectors is the energy available to generate non-energy goods and services .
The size of that surplus sets broad but distinct limits on human economic aspirations .
Falling water , for example , can deliver a large EROI in a specific location , but the total energy surplus available to a society from falling water is limited by the relatively sparse spatial distribution of the resource .
The amount of energy surplus potentially available from diffuse energy sources such as solar and wind power is just as important as their EROI .
Contrary to popular belief , agriculture did not supplant hunting and gathering as the major food production technology because it had a higher EROI .
Indeed , hunting and gathering often produced a very high EROI in specific locations and around specific resources .
For example , the harvesting of energy - dense biomass in coastal whaling had an EROI in the neighborhood of 2000:1 .
Some hunting and gathering societies developed sophisticated social and civil institutions , and often consumed their energy surplus in the form of leisure time .
But hunting and gathering ultimately is limited by the distribution of edible net primary production in the biosphere , which limits population densities to about one person per square < a href = " http://www.eoearth.org/article/Meter ">kilometer .
The advantage of agriculture derives from the large net energy surplus delivered per unit land area and per person compared to hunting and gathering .
Agriculture thus erased the energetic limits to carrying capacity inherent in hunting and gathering , and released human labor and other productive resources from the farm .
The latter was a necessary condition for the industrialization of society .
3 . The unprecedented expansion of the human population , the global economy , and per capita living standards of the last 200 years was powered by high EROI , high energy surplus fossil fuels .
The penultimate position of fossil fuels in the energy hierarchy stems from the fact that they have a high EROI and a very large energy surplus .
The largest oil and gas fields , which were found early in the exploration process due to their sheer physical size , delivered energy surpluses that dwarfed any previous source ( and any source developed since then ) .
That surplus , in combination with other attributes , is what makes conventional fossil fuels unique .
The long run challenge society faces is to replace the current system with a combination of alternatives with similar attributes and a much lower carbon intensity .
4 . The principal economic impact of a shift to a lower EROI energy system is the increased opportunity cost of energy delivery .
A shift to a lower EROI energy system means that more of society 's productive resources are devoted -- directly and indirectly -- to delivering the same amount of energy .
That energy thus cannot be used for other purposes , notably consumption goods .
Energy used to make a drilling rig or wind turbine cannot be used to manufacture iPods or provide medical care .
5. Energy quality matters
Net energy is only one attribute of an energy system that determines it usefulness to society .
The usefulness of an energy system is determined by a complex combination of physical , technical , economic , and social attributes .
These include gravimetric and volumetric energy density , power density , emissions , cost and efficiency of conversion , financial risk , amenability to storage , risk to human health , and ease of transport .
These attributes combine to determine energy quality : differences in the ability of a unit of a fuel to perform useful services for people .
No single metric of an energy system captures all such attributes , including EROI .
It stands to reason , therefore , that a comprehensive and balanced comparison of energy technologies should employ a range of metrics , with their strengths and weaknesses duly noted .
Energy content per unit mass and per unit volume for various sources ( click to Enlarge )
Since all forms of energy can be completely converted to heat , heat units ( Btus , joules , calories , kilowatt - hours ) provide an easy way to aggregate different forms of energy .
For example , the world uses about 450x1015 Btu , or 450 " quads " of energy each year .
That quantity is the aggregation of dozens of different energy types added together by multiplying their mass or volume used times their heat content per unit mass or volume .
But this approach implicitly assumes that " all Btus are equal , " i.e. , that people value a heat unit of electricity the same as a heat unit of coal .
Of course , this is not the case .
Electricity performs important tasks that coal cannot , or it performs them more effectively .
People are willing to pay 15 times more for a heat unit of electricity ( in the U.S. ) because of these differences .
Accounting for differences in energy quality can dramatically alter the results of net energy analyses .
6. Market imperfections that distort prices and cost also affect EROI
Dollar - based assessments of energy systems are distorted by market imperfections such as externalities , subsidies , and government policies .
The result is that the full social cost of energy is unaccounted for .
However , EROI is plagued by many of the same problems .
For example , there is no established methodology to incorporate the ecological and human health impacts of energy production and use in the calculation of EROI , so it too overstates benefits to society .
In fact , economic analysis has better developed tools to estimate and aggregate external costs than energy analysis .
The calculation of indirect costs in energy analysis ( e.g. , the energy used to manufacture a wind turbine ) often is based on economic data .
Subsidies and other government policies affect decisions made in the market , and thus affect the economic data often used as inputs to energy analysis , including the pattern of capital investment .
A good example of this was government regulation of the natural gas industry in the U.S. in the 1970s .
Deep , new , and presumably lower EROI natural gas was assigned a higher price than shallow , old , and presumably higher EROI gas in an attempt to stimulate overall exploration .
Any change in the overall EROI for gas extraction caused by this policy had little to do with “ resource depletion ” per se .
7 . The methodologies to perform net energy analysis are well established
Conventional wisdom in the blogsphere and other Internet communities is that there are no guidelines for performing net energy analysis .
In fact , there is a rich , well - established body of literature on the subject , most of which was developed in the first wave of energy research in the 1970s and 1980s .
This body of work includes not only methodological detail , but also discussions about how to deal with intractable problems such as joint costs and outputs , the energy cost of human labor , choosing appropriate system boundaries , among many others .
The record also has a rich history of debate about the virtues of net energy analysis , particularly in regards to what it adds , if anything , to a discussion that already includes a thorough economic assessment .
The current discussion surrounding net energy analysis would be significantly enhanced if participants were better informed by previous work .
8 . The relation between “ peak oil ” and the EROI for world oil production is unknown
This statement is true for two reasons .
The first and most obvious reason is that we do not know when world oil production will peak , and wo n’t know definitively until sometime afterwards .
Second , and more importantly , there is no comprehensive and reliable assessment of the historic EROI for world oil production .
There is a distinct lack of reliable public data on the direct and indirect costs associated with oil production in many regions of the world .
The lower 48 U.S. is the only region for which we can compare the trends in EROI and oil production .
There we see a remarkable convergence : crude oil production peaks in 1970 and then declines , and the EROI for that production peaks at about the same time .
The timing of both peaks is consistent with a change in the underlying cost structure of the resource , when the cost - increasing effects of depletion began to outweigh the cost - decreasing effects of technological change .
If such as connection holds at the global level , then the timing and impact of “ peak oil ” takes on added significance .
9 . Technological change affects EROI just as it affects price and cost
There is a widely held assumption that the EROI for a nonrenewable energy resource such as crude oil or a renewable resource such as wind inexorably decline once the physical quality of the resource base begins to decline ( e.g. , smaller and deeper fields , or less windy sites ) .
This is not necessarily the case .
Technological change that lowers the dollar cost of extraction can also lower the energy cost of extraction .
For example , developing the ability to drill multiple and directional wells from a single platform lowered the dollar cost per well , and it may well have lowered the indirect energy embodied in the materials required to extract oil .
The well - documented technical improvements that have lowered the dollar cost of emerging technologies such as wind and solar undoubtedly exert at least some downward pressure on energy costs as well .
The decline in cost for ethanol fuel produced from sugarcane in Brazil ( click to Enlarge )
Technological change exogenous to the energy industry also affects the EROI .
For example , the development of more efficient combustion engines would , ceteris paribus , improve the EROI for oil extraction that relies on such engines to lift oil to the surface .
Similarly , a decrease in the quantity of energy required to produce a kilogram of steel will , ceteris paribus , improve the EROI by reducing the energy embodied in oil field equipment .
10 .
Alternatives to the dominant energy and power systems show a wide range in EROI
Most alternatives to conventional liquid fuels have very low or unknown EROIs .
The EROI for ethanol derived from corn grown in the U.S. is about 1.5:1 , well below that for conventional motor gasoline .
Ethanol from sugarcane grown in Brazil apparently has a higher EROI , perhaps as high as 8:1 , due to higher yields of sugarcane compared to corn , the use of bagasse as an energy input , and significant cost reductions in ethanol production technology .
Shale oil and coal liquefaction have low EROIs and high carbon intensities , although little work has been done in this area in more than 20 years .
The Alberta oil sands remain an enigma from a net energy perspective .
Anecdotal evidence suggests an EROI of 3:1 , but these reports lack veracity .
Certainly oil sands will have a lower EROI than conventional crude oil due to the more diffuse nature of the resource base and associated increase in direct and indirect processing energy costs .
On the power generation side , coal , and hydropower have the highest EROI among conventional power systems , although the latter has very limited potential for further expansion in most regions of the world .
Nuclear power appears to have a lower EROI , but there are very few credible studies that are thorough and unbiased .
We do not know what the EROI will be from the new generation of nuclear reactors that would be built if demand for them returns .
Wind has a very favorable EROI in the right conditions , while solar thermal and photovoltaic systems have lower EROIs compared to coal and hydropower .
As outlined above , a key issue is the size of the surplus that can realistically be delivered by those renewable power technologies .
A final point for consideration :
Carbon may trump EROI .
The growing concern that climate change may impose swift and large costs on society may drive the next major energy transition .
It is plausible that carbon intensity , as opposed to net energy , may be the principal attribute of future energy systems that determines the timing and pace of their adoption .
Society may choose to forgo the benefits of a larger energy surplus to reduce its exposure to climate - related risks .

Whether this is on the level I can’t vouch , but inevitable it surely was .
A press release making the rounds on the web ( here and here , for instance ) claims that a conceptual artist named Jonathon Keats has made Cage ’s 4 ’33 ” into a ringtone .
( After all the goddamned ringtone advertisements that internet robots have tried to post on this blog as comments , I ca n’t even believe I ’m mentioning this . )
I consider cellphones an evil technology , and wo n’t have one : no one answers them , they go off at inappropriate times , they ’re a sonic nuisance , their batteries run down and when they do n’t you ’re out of range anyway , if you hang somebody people use them to photograph it , they ’re easy to lose and losing them ’s a tragedy – and most of all , I ’m already easier to contact than I like being .
But , a silent ringtone ?
What ’s funny is the claims trumpeted for the device , which , even in this modest context , can only be called grandiose :
Since the beginning of time , pure silence has been available only in the vacuum of space . [???]
Now conceptual artist Jonathon Keats has digitally generated a span of silence , four minutes and thirty - three seconds in length , portable enough to be carried on a cellphone .
His silent ringtone … is expected to bring quiet to the lives of millions of cellphone users , as well as those close to them .
“ When major artists such as 50 Cent and Chamillionaire started making ringtones , I realized that anything was possible in this new medium , ” says Mr. Keats , whose previous art projects include attempting to genetically engineer God .
“ I also knew that another artist , John Cage , had formerly tried , and failed , to create a silent interlude . ”
Mr. Cage once famously composed four minutes and thirty - three seconds of silence , which was performed on a piano , in front of a live audience , back in 1952 .
By all accounts , though , his silence was imperfect , owing to the limitations of the technology available at the time .
“ John Cage ca n’t be blamed , ” says Mr. Keats .
“ He lived in an analog age . ” [ emphasis added ]
This kind of reminds me of Monty Burns about to engulf Springfield in perpetual darkness : “ Since the beginning of time , mankind has yearned to destroy the sun ! ”
There are many other comments one could make , but the reader can supply them as well as I .

The president whom George W. Bush may resemble most is not his biological father , George H.W. Bush , or even Ronald Reagan , who often seems his ideological father , but James K. Polk , a dynamic and willful leader few discuss anymore .
Polk , when elected president as a Democrat in 1844 , had more political experience than Bush ( Polk had spent 20 years in elective office , compared with Bush ’s six ) .
But like Bush ( who was 54 in 2000 ) , Polk was young ( 49 ) and extremely self - confident when he took office .
Polk may be the only predecessor who matched Bush ’s determination to drive massive change on a minute margin of victory .
Polk won by fewer than 38,000 votes of 2.7 million cast .
Over four tumultuous years , he pursued an ambitious , highly partisan agenda that offered little to those who had voted against him .
Sound familiar ?
Strong on vision but weak on building consensus , Polk advanced his goals more than seemed possible in a closely divided country .
But Polk ’s tactics deepened the nation ’s divisions and fanned the flames that later exploded into the Civil War .
Advertisement
It ’s worth considering Polk ’s record not because Americans will take up arms against each other anytime soon -- although you might never know that from listening to talk radio -- but because it suggests that a president who slights the need to build national consensus can seed long - term problems that are n’t immediately apparent amid short - term successes .
Polk was inarguably a visionary :
He saw the United States as a continental nation stretching from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean .
And he was determined to advance that vision over any obstacle .
After completing the annexation of the independent Republic of Texas negotiated under his predecessor , Polk immediately targeted the vast Mexican holdings from the Southwest through California .
When Mexico would n’t sell him the territory , Polk claimed that the border of Texas extended much farther South than when it had been a Mexican state , and provocatively sent U.S. troops to occupy the disputed terrain .
Mexico , which had rattled sabers itself , attacked and war began .
It did n’t end for nearly two years , proving much costlier and bloodier than the president had anticipated .
The war also profoundly divided the country .
The opposition Whigs , who would mostly dissolve into the Republican Party in the 1850s , accused the president of “ deliberately provoking a war and then lying about Mexico ’s responsibility for starting the conflict , ” wrote historian Joel H. Silbey in his recent book “ Storm Over Texas . ”
Advertisement
Among the Whigs most outraged by Polk ’s conduct was a freshman U.S. House member from Illinois named Abraham Lincoln .
Doris Kearns Goodwin picks up the story in her panoramic new book “ Team of Rivals : The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln . ”
Shortly after taking office , Goodwin writes , Lincoln voted for a Whig resolution that charged the president with “ unnecessarily and unconstitutionally ” initiating the war .
To accept Polk ’s justifications , Lincoln later complained , would be to “ allow the president to invade a neighboring nation ... whenever he may choose to say he deems it necessary . ”
Polk eventually won the war and added to American territory an expanse that included California , New Mexico , Arizona and big pieces of the Mountain West .
Yet in the process
Polk sharpened conflict not only between the two major parties but within his own party , and deepened the antagonism between Northerners ( many of whom sought to bar the spread of slavery into the newly acquired lands ) and the South .
Polk failed to understand the cost to his presidency , and to the nation , of governing in a manner that was increasingly seen as championing the priorities of one interest , Southern slaveholders .
The charge was n’t entirely fair , but the impatient Polk never recognized the value of concessions that could broaden consensus .
When Polk stepped down , Silbey writes , he left behind “ ominous cracks ” in the political and social institutions that had encouraged national unity .
Much separates Polk ’s war with Mexico from Bush ’s with Iraq .
But obvious echoes reverberate .
Much like Polk with continental expansion , Bush has focused his presidency on a single goal : fighting Islamic terrorism , largely by encouraging the spread of democracy .
In pursuit of that vision , Bush , like Polk , launched a war whose initial justification has spawned bitter dispute .
And , like Polk , Bush has seen that war become more grueling and divisive than he had expected .
Advertisement
Polk ’s unwavering , impermeable conviction defines one approach for organizing a presidency in such circumstances .
But Polk ’s early critic -- Lincoln -- offers
Bush a better model for leadership during a difficult war .
In the Civil War , Lincoln was nothing if not resolute .
But as Goodwin notes , he also calibrated his decisions -- from key personnel appointments to the timing of emancipation -- to hold together all shades of opinion committed to the Union .
Bush lately has met more with Democrats and acknowledged mistakes on Iraq .
But substantively , he has not conceded much , either about Iraq or his tactics in the broader war on terrorism ( except his belated capitulation to Senate demands for a ban on torture in the interrogation of prisoners ) .
The divisions over Iraq are so deep that nothing Bush could do would bridge them entirely , and his inclination to ignore his most implacable opponents is understandable .
But Bush would place the nation ’s security on a more stable foundation if he worked harder to find a consensus agenda with those critics whose assessment of the threat in Iraq and at home was closer to his own .
Part of Lincoln ’s genius , as one close advisor wrote , was his understanding that in the pursuit of national unity , it was the task of the president “ to mollify and moderate ” the country ’s fractious interests and diverse viewpoints .
That ’s one reason Lincoln is revered and Polk , for all his ferocious accomplishments , is barely remembered .

Floyd Landis , who on Sunday became the third American cyclist to win the Tour de France , tested positive for illegally high levels of testosterone during the race , his team announced today .
If a second test confirms the results , Landis may be stripped of his Tour de France championship .
That has happened only once before , when Maurice Garin was disqualified in 1904 for breaking race rules .
The Phonak team said that it had suspended Landis and that it would fire him if a backup test confirmed the initial result .
In a statement on its Web site , Phonak said the International Cycling Union had notified the team on Wednesday that tests on Landis ’s urine sample discovered “ an unusual level of testosterone / epitestosterone ratio ” after Stage 17 of the Tour de France .
The team and the rider were “ totally surprised , ” the statement said , and will ask for an analysis of a second sample taken at the same time “ to prove either that this result is coming from a natural process or that this is resulting from a mistake . ”
In Stage 17 , Landis produced one of the greatest performances in cycling history , improbably roaring back into the lead pack after falling eight minutes behind the day before .
His subsequent victory became the feel - good story that the Tour needed , particularly after the way the race had begun .
Inspired by Jerome at The Corporate Cynic I have decided to take a break from detailing work issues and people that make me angry and write about qualities in people I have worked for and with who were capable of inspiring the best from people rather than simply demanding it .
OK , to provide contrast I ’m going to give negative examples as well but this is still more positive than my usual approach .
I ’m going with the generic terms of “ leaders ” because the roles filled by the people who inspired this post have varied over the years .
Some have been team leaders , some have been project managers , some have been departmental managers and some have been CIOs .
The Corporate Cynic does a good job of covering qualities that are applicable in any industry but for this post I ’m going to focus on qualities that are of particular value in IT leaders .
Arguably , these traits have value beyond IT environments but they are more integral to an inspiring IT leader .
A passion for technology Great IT leaders do n’t have to be hardcore geeks but if they are n’t passionate about technology , if they are n’t excited about the possibilities of the future then they ’re hardly going to inspire enthusiasm in their staff .
IT staff can tell a mile off when a manager is only interested in climbing the corporate ladder and has no passion for the work .
Knowing they are n’t the smartest
It ’s actually often a bad idea to promote the best programmer ( for example ) to management .
Good workplaces find ways to reward good IT workers other than pushing them away from what they are good at and into management .
Strong IT leaders understand the concepts behind the technology but are happy to acknowledge when superior expertise exists within the team .
Bad managers refuse to admit when someone is smarter than them and refuse to take the advice of people who know better than them simply because they happen to be subordinate .
Knowing how to promote IT within the business
The best managers I have worked with have gone beyond protecting IT staff from office politics and have actively promoted the benefits of IT at board level .
The confidence this gives IT staff helps them deliver better quality results .
Bad managers promote themselves at the expense of the IT department .
They take credit for success and blame the team for problems .
Provide a vision Doing this right can be a bit of a balancing act .
The dynamic nature of IT make providing a compelling vision even more important for inspiring workers .
Steve Jobs might not be God but the level of direction he gives Apple is a major factor in the dedication of the staff and the company ’s success .
But there has to be integrity and depth behind any talk of vision – IT staff can smell bullshit in this area a mile off .
These are some qualities that can help a leader inspire IT workers .
Of course all the other good stuff covered by the Corporate Cynic should be there too – being honest , respectful , supportive , dependable .
Why is this even important ?
The number of bad managers who place no importance on inspiring staff provide fuel for a million blogs .
The “ do what you ’re paid to and stop complaining ” attitude is so common it seems like it must be taught at day one of business school .
But I know from experience that , on average , being “ inspired ” is far more important to IT workers than it is for many others .
Most IT people start working in IT because they love the work .
They start “ working ” on IT long before they ’re employed to do it .
And sadly , truly inspiring IT leaders are few and far between .
Most bad managers I have been subjected to seem to take active joy in treating their staff badly .
They think giving staff more than the minimum is inefficient and a waste of time and money .
But in purely economic terms , giving IT staff inspiration is one of the most valuable things a manager can .
Inspired IT workers will willingly work longer , harder and produce higher quality work .
The thing is , leaders capable of inspiring their staff probably do n’t need any advice from me .
And I worry that bad managers will exploit the above tips by using the other lesson they learn on the first day of business school : “ once you learn to fake sincerity , everything else is easy . ”
An artist 's impression of the newly discovered planetary system .
The planets are each about the mass of Neptune and orbit around the Sun - like star HD 69830 .
Three medium - sized planets ofroughly the same mass as Neptune have been discovered around a nearby Sun - like star , scientists announced today .
The planets were discoveredaround HD 69830 , a star slightly less massive than the Sun located 41 light - years away in the constellation Puppis ( the Stern ) , using the ultra - precise HARPSspectrograph on the EuropeanSouthern Observatory 's 3.6 - meter La Sillatelescope in Chile .
The finding , detailed in the May18 issue of the journal Nature , marks a first for astronomers because previously discovered multi-planet solarsystems besides our own contain at least one giant , Jupiter - sized planet .
" For the first time , wehave discovered a planetary system composed of several Neptune - massplanets , " said study team member Christophe Lovis of the Geneva Observatory in Switzerland .
The setupis similar to our own solar system in many ways :
The outermost planets islocated just within the star 's habitable zone , where temperatures are moderateenough for liquid water to form , and the system also contains an asteroid belt .
The newly discovered planetshave masses of about 10 , 12 and 18 times that of Earth and they zip around thestar in rapid orbits of about 9 , 32 and 197 days , respectively .
Based on their distances fromthe star , two inner worlds nearest the star are rocky planets similar toMercury , the scientists suspect .
The outermost planet is thought to have asolid core of rock and ice and shrouded by a thick gas envelope .
Recent observations by NASA 's SpitzerSpace Telescope last year revealed that HD 69830 also hosts an asteroidbelt , making it the only other Sun - like star known to have one .
When the asteroid belt wasfound , it was suspected that there might be an unseen planet that wasshepherding the asteroids ; it now seems that there is more than one shepherd .
The researchers think the asteroid belt could lie between the two outermost planetsor beyond the third planet .
The planets have not beenphotographed .
They were found using the Doppler , or " wobble , " technique , in which astronomers infer the presence of a planet by measuring thegravitational influence it exerts on its parent star .
This technique was usedto find most of the more than 180 planets so far discovered .
In the early years of planethunting , the wobble technique was sensitive enough to spot only large , massiveplanets because they produce more significant stellar wobbles .
However , thetechnique has since been refined to the point where lower - mass planets can now bedetected .
So this Thanksgiving my wife and I went over to her parent ’s place and brought along the Wii since she had talked it up so much over the past four days .
Now , her parents are not gamers in the least .
Her father played EA ’s NHL titles on the PC in the mid 90s , and besides the occasional game of Tetris on the original Game Boy , I do n’t think her mother had played a game since .
Nintendo stated that this system was made to get gamers and non-gamers playing together and I wanted to see just how easy this would be to accomplish .
Both of my wife ’s parents were big into bowling when she was a child , so out of all the Wii Sports games we figured this would be the one to get them playing .
After hooking it up , we were able to convince her father to give it a try first .
Here is some video I shot of what I think is his second or third time using the system .
As you ’ll see , he ’s still asking what all of the buttons do , but he ’s able to bowl a nice frame for just starting out .
[ gv data=”/wp-content/uploads/2006/11/25/WiiExperiment3.flv ” width = ” 416 ″ height = ” 352 ″ ] [ / gv ]
Continue reading for further results from the Wii Experiment .
Eventually we were able to get my mother - in - law to play after she saw how much fun her husband was having with this “ fake bowling . ”
Amazingly she picked the whole process up rather quickly and , as you can see below , was able to bowl a strike on her second frame .
[ gv data=”/wp-content/uploads/2006/11/25/WiiExperiment1.flv ” width = ” 416 ″ height = ” 352 ″ ] [ / gv ]
We ended up bowling on the Wii for six hours straight .
Every time the game finished we would get to the screen which gave us the option to “ Play Again ” or “ Quit ” and my father - in - law would yell , “ AGAIN !!! ”
This might have been partially due to the amount of adult beverages we consumed throughout the evening but hey , we needed to give this bowling experience a bit of authenticity right ?
The more we played the more advanced tactics were used .
My father - in - law eventually figured out how to put spin on the ball , and after a few frames of experimentation was able to hook it into the pocket and pull off more strikes .
My wife continued her domination over everyone and reached a personal best of 214 .
She even broke Pro level and has 1075 skill points .
Needless to say , two days after the event all of our arms are hurting .
Who knew that a video game that is n’t very demanding physically could wear your muscles out so much ?
I think this just goes to prove that Nintendo ’s Wii is truly a system that anyone can enjoy .
The controls are so intuitive that you do n’t even need a gaming background to play them .
The fact that experiences picked up in real life , such as bowling for ten years on a league , can be applied almost seamlessly towards playing the game is a credit to Nintendo ’s innovation .
Plus it can get your father - in - law to do this :

Canada set an important example of decency when it offered a formal apology and compensation worth millions of dollars to a Syrian - born Canadian citizen who was a victim of President Bush ’s use of open - ended detention , summary deportation and even torture in the name of fighting terrorism .
Last week ’s announcement by Prime Minister Stephen Harper came more than four years after the nightmare began for the Canadian , Maher Arar , a 36 - year - old software engineer .
On his way back from a family vacation , he was detained by U.S. officials at Kennedy Airport on the basis of unsubstantiated information from the Canadian police .
After being held in solitary confinement in a Brooklyn detention center and interrogated without proper access to legal counsel , he was sent to Syria , where he was imprisoned for nearly a year and tortured .
It was all part of a legally and morally unsupportable practice known as extraordinary rendition , the deportation of terrorism suspects to countries where the regimes are known to use torture and to disdain basic human rights protections .
Four months ago , a Canadian government panel concluded that Mr. Arar had never had a terrorism connection , and that Americans had misled Canada about their plans for him .
The Bush administration stonewalled the inquiry .
It has responded to a new Canadian request to remove Mr. Arar from a United States security watch list by rudely telling Canada , its democratic northern neighbor and strategic ally , to mind its own business .
Search hard enough and you might find a pundit who believes what George W. Bush believes , which is that history will redeem his administration .
But from just about everyone else , on the right as vehemently as on the left , the verdict has been rolling in :
This administration , if not the worst in American history , will soon find itself in the final four .
Even those who appeal to history ’s ultimate judgment halfheartedly acknowledge as much .
One seeks tomorrow ’s vindication only in the context of today ’s dismal performance .
About the only failure more pronounced than the president ’s has been the graft - filled plunder of GOP lawmakers–at least according to opinion polls , which in May gave the GOP - controlled Congress favorability ratings in the low 20s , about 10 points lower than the president ’s .
This does not necessarily translate into electoral Armageddon ; redistricting and other incumbency - protection devices help protect against that .
But even if many commentators think that Republicans may retain control over Congress , very few think they should .
Eager to salvage conservatism from the wreckage of conservative rule , right - wing pundits are furiously blaming right - wing politicians for failing to adhere to right - wing convictions .
Libertarians such as Bruce Bartlett fret that under Republican control , government has not shrunk , as conservatives prescribe , but has grown .
Insiders like Peggy Noonan complain that Republicans have become–well , insiders ; they are too focused on retaining power and too disconnected from the base whose anger pushed them into power .
Idealistic younger conservatives bewail the care and feeding of the K Street beast .
Paleocons Pat Buchanan and Robert Novak blame neocons William Kristol and Charles Krauthammer for the debacle that is Iraq .
Through all these laments there pulsates a sense of desperation :
A conservative president and an even more conservative Congress must be repudiated to enable genuine conservatism to survive .
Sure , the Bush administration has failed , all these voices proclaim .
But that is because Bush and his Republican allies in Congress borrowed big government and foreign - policy idealism from the left .
The ideas of Woodrow Wilson and John Maynard Keynes , from their point of view , have always been flawed .
George W. Bush and Tom DeLay just prove it one more time .
Conservative dissidents seem to have done an admirable job of persuading each other of the truth of their claims .
Of course , many of these dissidents extolled the president ’s conservative leadership when he was riding high in the polls .
But the real flaw in their argument is akin to that of Trotskyites who , when confronted with the failures of communism in Cuba , China and the Soviet Union , would claim that real communism had never been tried .
If leaders consistently depart in disastrous ways from their underlying political ideology , there comes a point where one has to stop just blaming the leaders and start questioning the ideology .
The collapse of the Bush presidency , in other words , is not just due to Bush ’s incompetence ( although his administration has been incompetent beyond belief ) .
Nor is it a response to the president ’s principled lack of intellectual curiosity and pitbull refusal to admit mistakes ( although those character flaws are certainly real enough ) .
And the orgy of bribery and special - interest dispensation in Congress is not the result of Tom DeLay ’s ruthlessness , as impressive a bully as he was .
This conservative presidency and Congress imploded , not despite their conservatism , but because of it .
Contemporary conservatism is first and foremost about shrinking the size and reach of the federal government .
This mission , let us be clear , is an ideological one .
It does not emerge out of an attempt to solve real - world problems , such as managing increasing deficits or finding revenue to pay for entitlements built into the structure of federal legislation .
It stems , rather , from the libertarian conviction , repeated endlessly by George W. Bush , that the money government collects in order to carry out its business properly belongs to the people themselves .
One thought , and one thought only , guided Bush and his Republican allies since they assumed power in the wake of Bush vs.
Gore : taxes must be cut , and the more they are cut–especially in ways benefiting the rich –the better .
But like all politicians , conservatives , once in office , find themselves under constant pressure from constituents to use government to improve their lives .
This puts conservatives in the awkward position of managing government agencies whose missions–indeed , whose very existence –they believe to be illegitimate .
Contemporary conservatism is a walking contradiction .
Unable to shrink government but unwilling to improve it , conservatives attempt to split the difference , expanding government for political gain , but always in ways that validate their disregard for the very thing they are expanding .
The end result is not just bigger government , but more incompetent government .
“ Ideas , ” a distinguished conservative named Richard Weaver once wrote , “ have consequences . ”
Americans have learned something about the consequences of conservative ideas during the Bush years that they never had to confront in the more amiable Reagan period .
As a way of governing , conservatism is another name for disaster .
And the disasters will continue , year after year , as long as conservatives , whose political tactics are frequently as brilliant as their policy - making is inept , find ways to perpetuate their power .
The United States , as the political scientist Louis Hartz argued in the 1950s , was born liberal .
We fought for our independence against Great Britain and the conservatism that flourished there .
In Europe , a conservative was someone who defended the traditions of the monarchy , justified the privileges of the nobility , and welcomed the intervention of a state - affiliated clergy in politics .
But all those things would be tossed out by the revolutionaries who led the war for independence and then wrote the Constitution .
We chose to have an elected president , not an anointed monarch .
Our Constitution prohibited the granting of titles of nobility .
We separated church and state .
Of course , we had more than our share of thinkers who distrusted national authority ; conservative political philosophy may not come naturally to Americans , but a fear of centralized power and an unwillingness to pay heavy taxes does .
Beneath the broad political liberalism embodied in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution was a frequently unexamined conservatism that questioned the very idea of the vibrant , expansive society that America promised to be .
Odd men out in America ’s liberal political culture , America ’s conservatives were never very unified .
Alexander Hamilton and John Marshall wanted to see a strong national government created to improve America ’s economic prospects , even if they retained an aristocratic sense that only social superiors should control that government .
( John Adams outdid them on behalf of a strong executive ; he thought our first president should be addressed as a monarch ) .
But this kind of New England Federalism would go into abeyance once America ’s democratizing forces were unleashed .
Others insisted that this country should embody timeless Christian principles ; they , however , soon ran up against the skepticism of the Founding Fathers and conceptions of religious liberty associated with dissenting Protestantism .
With the decline of both , the only significant conservatism left would come from defenders of slavery such as John C. Calhoun .
Once the advocate of a strong national government , Calhoun , putting the rights of slaveholders first , viewed this country as a compact among states , not as a unified society .
His ideas would live on in the voices of those thinkers , primarily Southern , who objected to relying on national power to promote equal rights for all .
As this litany of lost causes suggests , our conservatives , while representing different regions and economic interests , were united by their irrelevance in the face of history .
If the term reactionary is too pejorative , let ’s call them reactive .
In this entrepreneurial , mobile , innovative , and individualistic country , conservatism was constantly on the defensive , aiming to preserve things –deference , reverence , and diffidence , to name three –that most Americans were anxious to shed .
Deprived of both a church and state to defend , American conservatives became advocates for privileges determined by birth , suffrage restricted to an elite , and rural virtues over urban realities .
And so conservatives faced a dilemma from the moment the first shots were heard around the world .
They could be true to their ideals and stand on the sidelines of political power .
Or they could adjust their principles in the interests of political realism and thus negate the essential conservative teaching that principles are meant to be timeless .
All the conservatives that played any role in America ’s history since the age of Jackson chose political relevance over ideological purity .
The Whigs abandoned aristocracy to nominate a popular military leader in the 1840s , hoping thereby to out - democratize the Jacksonians .
An emerging business elite defended the free market–an 18th - century liberal innovation detested by agrarian - oriented conservatives –to protect the very kind of privileges that Adam Smith hoped the free market would curtail .
Isolationists abandoned the cosmopolitanism of Hamilton , perhaps America ’s greatest conservative , for a populistic nativism suspicious of worldly grandeur .
Clergy from evangelical churches played down such depressing doctrines as original sin and predestination in favor of the wonders of salvation for all .
European conservatism had defended authority against liberty and social standing against equality .
American conservatives used the language of liberty to justify inequality and promoted democracy to stand against change .
A conservative in America , in short , is someone who advocates ends that cannot be realized through means that can never be justified , at least not on the terrain of conservatism itself .
In the past , the ends sought were the preservation of hierarchy , even if the means included appeals to democratic sentiment .
In more recent times , conservatives promised order and stability through means dependent upon the uncertainties and insecurities of the market .
Unwilling to accept the fact that government was here to stay , conservatives stood on the sidelines as conditions kept arising that demanded bigger and more effective national authority .
Westward expansion required Washington to settle the issue of slavery , and the recalcitrant South ultimately lost .
Industrialization forced the country to deal with trusts and workplace oppression , and the Gilded Age leaders ultimately lost to the Progressives .
The Depression demanded stronger government action even more urgently , even as the advocates of laissez faire opposed the New Deal .
Similarly , the rise of fascism necessitated a vast expansion of federal power ; and again , the conservative impulse , in the form of isolationism , lost .
By the 1950s , anti-federal - government conservatism was somewhat in retreat .
Conservatives in the Republican Party still pushed for spending restraint while Southern conservatives in the Democratic Party resisted a greater role for the federal government in entrenching civil rights for blacks .
But in general , leaders of both political parties , reflecting public sentiment , basically accepted big government as legitimate .
The liberal propensities within both parties led to a federal government that continued to take on new challenges as they arose , from providing healthcare to seniors and the poor to regulating product safety and pollution .
But as we know now , the conservative anti-federal government impulse did not go away .
Barry Goldwater , the last conservative purist in America , paid a huge political price for his frank disdain of government ; abolishingmandatory Social Security and the Tennessee Valley Authority was not the way to win votes among the elderly in the South .
In the 1970s , the conservative impulse went underground , incubating in a string of new think tanks funded by conservative philanthropists and sympathetic corporations .
Although some of those who followed in Goldwater ’s footsteps –Nixon , Reagan , Bush , and then Bush–professed to share his distaste for government , none stood in the way of its growth .
When given the opportunity , they shied away from enacting the think - tank talk of washing government down the bathroom drain .
Although Ronald Reagan , a convert to anti-federal - government conservatism , won the White House in 1980 by feeding on public disgust with the excesses of liberalism , whatever plans he may have had to roll back the federal government were blocked by a Democratic Congress and public opinion .
( Remember , for instance , the drubbing the GOP took in 1982 when it tried to axe Social Security benefits ) .
Newt Gingrich and his revolutionaries rode a similar wave in 1994 , but their plans were at least partially stymied by Bill Clinton ’s control of the White House and , again , by public opinion ( the GOP lost seats in 1998 ) .
Conservatives had n’t held both Congress and the White House for a full term since 1932 , before the creation of big government as we know it .
For the first time in U.S history , conservatives had total control of the agencies of superpower government .
If government is necessary , bad government , at least for conservatives , is inevitable , and conservatives have been exceptionally good at showing just how bad it can be .
Hence the truth revealed by the Bush years : Bad government–indeed , bloated , inefficient , corrupt , and unfair government –is the only kind of conservative government there is .
Conservatives cannot govern well for the same reason that vegetarians cannot prepare a world - class boeuf bourguignon :
If you believe that what you are called upon to do is wrong , you are not likely to do it very well .
Three examples –FEMA , Medicare , and Iraq– should be sufficient to make this point .
Because liberals have historically welcomed government while conservatives have resisted it , it should come as no surprise that the Federal Emergency Management Agency worked so well under Bill Clinton and so poorly under Bush I and II .
True to a long tradition of disinterested public management , Clinton , in the wake of Hurricane Andrew , appointed James Lee Witt to head FEMA .
Witt refocused FEMA away from civil - defense efforts to increasingly predictable national disasters , fought for greater federal funding , achieved cabinet status for his agency , and worked closely with state and local officials .
For all the efforts by Republicans to attack their enemies , no one has ever put a dent in Witt ’s reputation .
Government under him was as good as government gets .
Upon assuming office , George W. Bush turned to former Texas campaign aide Joe Allbaugh to run FEMA and then shifted it into the new Department of Homeland Security ( whose creation he had opposed ) .
Allbaugh , and his hand - picked successor Michael Brown , like so many Bush appointees , were afflicted with what we might call “ learned incompetence . ”
They did not fail merely out of ignorance and inexperience .
Their ineptness , rather , was active rather than passive , the end result of a deliberate determination to prove that the federal government simply should not be in the business of disaster management .
“ Many are concerned that federal disaster assistance may have evolved into both an oversized entitlement program and a disincentive to effective state and local risk management , ” Allbaugh had testified before a Senate appropriations subcommittee in May , 2001 .
“ Expectations of when the federal government should be involved and the degree of involvement may have ballooned beyond what is an appropriate level .
” There was the conservative dilemma in a nutshell : a man put in charge of a mission in which he did not believe .
Long before Katrina destroyed New Orleans , Allbaugh and Brown were busy destroying FEMA : privatizing many of the agency ’s programs , shifting attention away from disaster management , and shedding no tears as scores of agency staff left in dismay .
Human beings cannot prevent natural disasters , but they can prevent man-made ones .
Not the Bush administration .
Its ideological hostility toward government all but guaranteed that the physical damage inflicted by a hurricane would be exacerbated by the human damage caused by incompetence .
The question of whether Medicare reform will prove politically fruitful for Republicans is still open .
But the question of whether it has proven to be an administrative nightmare is not .
There were two paths open to Republicans if they had been interested in creating an administratively coherent system of paying for the prescription drugs of the elderly .
One was to give the elderly nothing and insist that every person assume the full cost of his or her medication .
The other was to have government assume responsibility for the costs of those drugs .
It is significant that in America ’s recent debates over prescription drugs , no one , not even the Cato Institute , argued that government should simply not be in the business at all .
As a society , we accept–indeed , we celebrate –the fact that older people can live longer and better lives thanks to radically improved medical technology as well as awe - inspiring advances in pharmacology .
A political party which consigned to death anyone who could not afford to participate in this medical revolution would die an early death itself .
But Republicans were just as unwilling to design a sensible program as they were unable to eliminate the existing one .
To prove their faith in the market , they gave people choices , when what they wanted was predictability .
To pay off the pharmaceutical industry , they refused to allow government to negotiate drug prices downward , thereby vastly inflating the program ’s costs .
To make sure government agencies did n’t administer the benefit , they lured in insurance companies with massive subsidies and imposed almost no rules on what benefits they could and could not offer .
The lack of rules led to a frustrating chaos of choices .
And the extra costs had to be made up by carving out a so - called “ doughnut hole ” in which the elderly , after having their drug purchases subsidized up to a certain point , would suddenly find themselves without federal assistance at all , only to have their drugs subsidized once again at a later point .
Caught between the market and the state , Republicans picked the worst features of each .
No single human being could have designed a program as unwieldy as this one .
It took the combined efforts of every faction in today ’s conservative movement to produce a public policy so removed from common sense .
The failure of the Bush administration to plan for the aftermath of the Iraq invasion was just one more , albeit the most serious , consequence of the conservative ambivalence toward government .
Neoconservatives were all for ambitious adventures abroad , and , in the aftermath of September 11 , they won the president ’s support .
But they never captured his pocketbook , which was tenaciously guarded by Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld .
Neocons wanted the Republican Party to live in the shadow of Henry “ Scoop ” Jackson .
Rumsfeld insisted that military adventures be funded in the spirit of Robert A. Taft .
So long as conservatives denigrate government while relying on government to achieve their objectives , Rumsfeld ’s vision of how to fight wars is the only kind of conservative foreign policy one can have .
His low - balling of troop estimates in Iraq was the foreign policy equivalent of libertarian economics : relying on government while refusing to pay for it .
His hostility toward Iraqi reconstruction resonated with those skeptical of rebuilding New Orleans .
His disdain for Colin Powell ’s State Department mirrored Joe McCarthy ’s for Dean Acheson’s .
Only a tried - and - true conservative could ever have come up with the idea of turning the management of Iraqi police forces over to private firms to the extent that Rumsfeld did , with catastrophic results for the Iraqis themselves .
While it is difficult to label someone who plans a war an isolationist , Rumsfeld ’s hostility toward America ’s historic allies represented a contemporary version of unilateralism , which has always been isolationism ’s first cousin .
The neoconservatives wanted to draft hugely expensive undertakings onto a party with an isolationist past .
The Secretary of Defense wanted to draft on to the same political party a distant war , but with the promise of being cheap and avoiding the loss of American lives .
It is not difficult to conclude which one would win in today ’s conservative environment .
For Pat Buchanan to blame the neocons for the failure in Iraq ignores the fact that the man most responsible for the failure , Donald Rumsfeld , has more in common with Buchanan than he does with Bill Kristol .
( One prominent neoconservative , however , Paul Wolfowitz , did sign on enthusiastically to Rumsfeld ’s agenda . )
Iraq failed for the same reasons that all conservative public policy efforts fail .
Refusing to acknowledge the importance of government while relying on it to achieve your objectives causes the same kind of chaos in foreign policy that it does in matters closer to home .
One of the favorite myths of contemporary conservative dissidents is that the K Street machine , instead of being the irreplaceable lynchpin of conservative power , was somehow a betrayal of its ideals .
This fable is captured by Matthew Continetti , a Weekly Standard reporter , in The K Street Gang , a conservative “ Mr. Smith Goes to Washington . ”
In Continetti ’s telling , once upon a time–let ’s make it 1994 – conservatives were idealistic revolutionaries .
Gingrich and his cohorts were “ optimistic , progressive , and overwhelmingly confident in the idea that you could run the federal government like a large corporation .
” Alas , however , Gingrich was unable to persuade his Republican colleagues to vote for Robert Walker of Pennsylvania as majority whip .
Texas ’s Tom DeLay won the post instead , and DeLay was a man “ who viewed government as a business–one that would maximize the advantages of business so that business would then donate to their political war chests . ”
In this account , Gingrich and DeLay are not part of the same Republican revolution ; indeed , one of them , DeLay , is a counterrevolutionary , Stalin to Gingrich ’s Trotsky .
( Yes , Continetti makes that comparison . )
The 1994 whip election , Continetti argues , became a struggle “ between those who viewed power as a means to the end of limiting government and those who viewed power as an end in itself .
” DeLay ’s victory was therefore the beginning of Gingrich ’s downfall .
Continetti’s tale is utterly implausible .
To accept it , you have to believe that Gingrich was unaware of the extent to which DeLay was working behind his back to undermine him .
You also have to explain away why many of those Republicans in Congress who voted for Gingrich for one position were also quite happy to vote for DeLay for another ; surely they believed that both men had roughly similar views on how their party should conduct itself in office .
Finally , you have to view Gingrich ’s attacks on K Street in the wake of DeLay ’s downfall as a continuation of his idealism , rather than positioning for a possible presidential race a view that only the most nave could hold .
The fact is that Gingrich and DeLay , although they detested each other , were both products of the same aggressive conservatism that swept the Republicans into power in the first place .
Far from representing two radically different forms of conservatism , they are best viewed as the good cop / bad cop dynamic of what was until recently a remarkably unified movement–one man providing the policy vision , the other adept at getting particular policies enacted .
The K Street Project was not the product of DeLay ’s wily machinations , sure to fall from prominence along with DeLay ’s fall from power .
( Now that DeLay is no longer majority leader , Republicans are not engaged in any serious effort to demolish the project ; their current leader , John Boehner , a former ally of Gingrich , understands full well its importance ) .
The seeds of the K Street Project were planted even before Gingrich assumed his position of majority leader , and the result will flower so long as conservative Republicans practice the kinds of politics they do .
Political parties expend the time and grueling energy to control government for different reasons .
Liberals , while enjoying the perquisites of office , also want to be in a position to use government to solve problems .
But conservatives have different motives for wanting power .
One is to prevent liberals from doing so ; if government cannot be made to disappear , at least it can be prevented from doing any good .
The other is to build a political machine in which business and the Republican Party can exchange mutual favors ; business will lavish cash on politicians ( called campaign contributions ) while politicians will throw the money back at business ( called public policy ) .
Conservatism will always attract its share of young idealists .
And young idealists will always be disillusioned by the sheer amount of corruption that people like Gingrich and DeLay generate .
If yesterday ’s conservative was a liberal mugged by reality , today ’s is a free - marketer fattened by pork .
Transforming the Republican Party into a highly disciplined organization determined to get its way without cooperation from the Democrats was an another objective shared by Gingrich and DeLay .
Indeed , the former , not the latter , deserves the credit for substituting British - style party discipline and ideological extremism for bipartisan cooperation and moderation in the U.S. House of Representatives .
Name an innovation associated with DeLay , and one discovers that it was previously institutionalized by Gingrich : developing redistricting rules to favor Republicans ; encouraging House Republicans to vote as a unified bloc ; weakening seniority so as to strengthen party leaders ; freezing the opposition party out of a role in governance .
It would take a decade after the Republican revolution of 1994 for the U. S. House of Representatives to fully transform itself into a body that no longer made a pretense of valuing fairness and deliberation .
But that is only because Tom DeLay possessed a political advantage denied Gingrich : a fellow Republican in the White House .
It is a characteristic trope of political journalism to blame both parties equally for any malfeasance .
But the partisan zealotry of the current U. S. House of Representatives has shocked such fair - minded , long - term observers of Congress as Norman Ornstein and Thomas Mann ; their book , The Broken Branch , is a lament for a time when Congressmen put the needs of their institution before those of their party .
If Republican conservatives are trying something new in the world–and changing one of the two branches of Congress into an institution more likely to be found in a one - party state strikes me as new indeed–it is worth asking where their approach came from .
And the answer is the same place where bad governance comes from : Partisanship this vindictive is part and parcel of what it means to be a conservative today .
Historically and philosophically , liberals and conservatives have disagreed with each other , not only over the ends political systems should serve , but over the means chosen to serve those ends .
Whether through the ideas of James Madison , Immanuel Kant , or John Stuart Mill , liberals have viewed violent conflict as regrettable and the use of political institutions as the best way to contain it .
Conservatives , from the days of Machiavelli to such twentieth - century figures as Germany ’s Carl Schmitt , have , by contrast , viewed politics as an extension of war , complete with no -holds - barred treatment of the enemy , iron - clad discipline in the ranks , cries of treason against those who do not support the effort with full - throated vigor , and total control over any spoils won .
From a conservative point of view , separation of powers is divisive , tolerance a luxury , fairness another word for weakness , and cooperation unnecessary .
If conservatives will not use government to tame Hobbes ’ state of nature , they will use it to strengthen Hobbes ’ state of nature .
Victory is the only thing that matters , and any tactic more likely to produce victory is justified .
The K Street Project , then , did not arise spontaneously out of the ether .
When Republicans in Congress began to inform lobbyists that in return for influence they would have to fire all the Democrats in their firms , they may have broken with long - standing traditions , but they were simply carrying forward politics - as - warfare the way conservative political philosophers have historically understood it .
Liberals do not generally have objections to working with conservatives ; indeed , having conservatives sign off on any expansion of government adds to the legitimacy of that expansion .
But conservatives tend to see working with liberals as corrupting ; in the immortal words of conservative activist Grover Norquist , “ bipartisanship is another name for date rape . ”
K Street is to lobbying what Fox News is to journalistic objectivity .
In the world that contemporary conservatives have brought into being , rules are not applicable to all parties to a conflict .
Rules are part of the conflict , and whoever wins the conflict gets to change the rules .
Once upon a time , conservatism may have appealed to history ’s losers , the agrarian interests displaced by industry or the small - business owners being bought out by multinational corporations .
Not any longer .
The most dynamic House Republicans , Gingrich and DeLay among them , did not arrive on Capitol Hill from rural byways and once - thriving but now depressed industrial towns ; they came from booming sunbelt communities in the forefront of global transformation .
They exploit Washington the way farmers once exploited land and industrial firms exploited workers .
Their efforts are designed to help business and to build their party , and for those tasks , Congress , and the money at its disposal , is a weapon to use , not an institution to shrink .
It took conservatives , who in the 18th and early 19th century supported quasi- feudal states and distrusted the instabilities of the market , a hundred years to become advocates of laissez faire .
And under the imperatives of the K Street Project , it took them just five to abandon their belief in laissez faire to support a corrupt business - government partnership bearing striking resemblance to feudalism .
For a disillusioned idealist such as Matthew Continetti , Washington , D.C. is now filled with “ people who mouth conservative principles while getting rich off conservative power . ”
But what good are conservatives principles without conservative power ?
And what chance was there that conservatives could gain and hold political power without their joined - at - the - hip connection to K Street ?
Nearly every electoral and legislative success conservatives have enjoyed over the past six years has been crucially aided by the organizational and financial contributions of corporate lobbyists .
The conservative vision of the world , because it is so hostile to government when government is so essential to the way we live now , remains unattractive to most Americans , which is why Republicans must rely on money to substitute for the large popular majorities they are unable to build and sustain .
The idea that it could have been , or can be , different is a fantasy .
A New England - based , patrician - oriented conservatism which insists on the importance of impersonal standards of high public conduct is as irrelevant in today ’s political economy as a Southern - style , gentlemanly conservatism that emphasizes chivalry and honor .
The cavaliers and Mugwumps are long - gone from conservatism , and the Duke Cunninghams have replaced them .
Behind the surge in right - wing criticism of the Bush presidency is the hope that aprs le deluge , Americans will give conservatism another chance .
But even if Americans were inclined to do so , what kind of conservatism could be offered to them ?
If it somehow defied all laws of political gravity and carried through on its promise to shrink government , conservatism would add considerably to the level of misery at home and abroad–and lose whatever majorities it may have had in the process .
If it managed to return to its roots in a South that no longer exists or a New England losing population to the rest of the country , conservatism would return to the marginalization that characterized its history .
If it retreated behind its borders , it would lack the means to protect itself against threats emanating from overseas .
The conservative dilemma , omnipresent in the past , looms over conservatism ’s future .
It can reveal its true face and consign itself to oblivion or it can govern without conviction and produce unending incompetence .
There are ways out of the conservative dilemma .
American conservatives could , for example , take away from the Bush years the lesson that they must change their ideology if they are ever again to make the Republican Party a serious party of governance .
This is not beyond the realm of possibility .
Conservatives in the American past–not only Hamilton and Marshall , but Daniel Webster and Henry Clay–were in favor of a strong government capable of meeting national objectives .
There exists , moreover , a modernizing version of conservatism in contemporary Europe , where conservatives recognize the inevitability of government but try to tailor its objectives and improve its competence .
Call this “ big government conservatism ” if you wish , but it would have little in common with that term as President Bush ’s critics use it to attack him and his administration .
This would not be a conservatism that used government to pay off friends and punish enemies but one that sought to use government to stabilize society and avoid periodic crises .
Admittedly , not much evidence exists in America today that conservatives are prepared to move in such a direction .
If anything , they seem to have reinforced and strengthened their determination to govern as incompetently and unfairly as they can .
The fact that they will leave behind a public sector in roughly the same condition that strip miners leave hillsides would cause nothing but pain to yesterday ’s patricians , for whom ideals such as responsibility and soundness were watchwords .
But today ’s conservatives have no problem passing on the costs of their present madness to future generations .
Governing well would require them to use the bully - pulpit of office to educate and uplift their base .
But since contemporary conservatives get their political energy from angry voices of rage and revenge , they will always blame others for the failures built into their ideology .
That is why conservatism so rarely makes for a good governance party .
As far as conservatives are concerned , it is always someone else ’s government , one reason they can be so indifferent to their own mismanagement .
Americans may have elected a Republican president and Congress , but they are unlikely to go back to a world in which one illness can devastate their last years or one storm can destroy their lives .
Because government is the one institution that allows us some control over our future , conservatism , which distrusts government so much , is best viewed as a natural counter to liberalism , which , if left unchecked , tends towards wasteful bureaucracy .
Indeed , as the Bush administration fully proves , conservatism remains a force of opposition even when it purports to be a governance party .
And so the best that can be hoped for is that American voters will do for conservatives what they are unable to do themselves : to vote them out of office .
Overview .
The Kenzo program implements the methods of Constructive Algebraic Topology .
The funny corresponding acronym CAT gave the idea to name this program as my beloved cat .
The first version of this program , called EAT for Effective Algebraic Topology , was a joint work with Julio Rubio ( 1990 ) .
The EAT program was totally rewritten with Xavier Dousson in 1998 , becoming Kenzo , on the one hand to include many technical improvements , in particular in memory management , improvements deduced from the EAT experience , and on the other hand to implement the Whitehead Tower and compute homotopy groups of arbitrary simply connected simplicial sets , the heart of Xavier 's thesis .
A detailed Kenzo documentation was simulatneously written by Yvon Siret .
The 1.1.8 version now proposed takes account of the new mathematical technology based on Discrete Vector Fields .
Discovered by Robin Forman , it happens this method considerably improves the implementation of the Eilenberg - Zilber theorem , twisted or not , and also the computation of the effective homology of the Eilenberg - MacLane spaces , crucial when using the Postnikov or Whitehead towers .
In the paper :
Roman Mikhailov , Jie Wu
On homotopy groups of the suspended classifying spaces
Algebraic & Geometric Topology , 2010 , vol.10 , pp.565–625 .
the authors state in Theorem 5.4 :
Let \( A_4\ ) be the 4 - th alternating group .
Then \( \pi_4 ( \Sigma K( A_4,1 ) ) = \ mathbf{Z}/4\ ) , with \ ( K( A_4,1 ) \ ) being the corresponding Eilenberg - MacLane space , and \( \Sigma\ ) the suspension functor .
The elementary method used by the Kenzo program , known as the Whitehead tower , produces a different result , namely \( \pi_4 ( \Sigma K( A_ 4,1 ) ) = \ mathbf{Z}/12\ ) .
The authors of the quoted paper inadvertently forgot the 3 - primary component .
This Kenzo computation was done by Ana Romero , using extra-modules devoted to group resolutions written by herself .

The Kenzo program is now used for an application in Neurology , for automatic counting of synapses in snapshots of neurons .

Other examples of results reachable by Kenzo :
Let \( P\mathbf {R}\ ) ( resp. \( P^n\mathbf {R}\ ) ) the infinite real projective space ( resp. the \( n\ ) - dimensional real projective space ) .
Then Kenzo has determined the groups H i ( \ Omega 2 ( PR/ P 2 R ) ; Z ) for i < 8 .
This computation has been at the origin of an interesting paper by Vladimir Smirnov determining the whole Z 2 - homology of the iterated loop spaces of the truncated projective spaces ( tex , dvi , ps : only the ps version contains the appendix but in a bad format because of TeX problems ) .
( \Omega ( PR/P R ) ; ) for i < 8 .

( PR/ P R ) for i < 8 .
These computations have motivated a nice work ( dvi , ps ) by Fred Cohen and Ran Levi , who go much further with other related spaces .
The field where Kenzo seems at this time the most in advance is with the spaces whose TeX notation is Y = \ Omega k ( X ) \cup 2 D p , where X is a simplicial set beginning in dimension n=p+k - 1 with a H n = Z ; a p-cell is attached to a loop space of X by a map of degree 2 .
Kenzo can compute the first homology groups of the first loop spaces of Y and also its first homotopy groups .
For example H i ( \ Omega ( \ Omega ( S 3 ) \cup 2 D 3 ) ) is computed by Kenzo for i < 10 .
( X ) \cup D , where X is a simplicial set beginning in dimension n=p+k - 1 with a H = Z ; a p-cell is attached to a loop space of X by a map of degree 2 .
Kenzo can compute the first homology groups of the first loop spaces of Y and also its first homotopy groups .
For example H ( \ Omega ( \Omega ( S ) \cup D ) ) is computed by Kenzo for i < 10 .
The longest Kenzo computation .
Consists in playing the following game :
Take the stunted real projective space P4 = P ∞ ( R ) / P 3 ( R ) .
Construct the loop space OP4 = Ω ( P4 ) .
It is easy to prove the homotopy group π 3 ( OP4 ) = Z. Attaching a 4 - disk e 4 to OP4 by a map S 3 → OP4 of degree 4 makes sense and products a new space DOP4 .
Construct the loop space ODOP4 = Ω ( DOP4 ) .
It is easy to proof π 2 ( ODOP4 ) = Z/4Z .
Attaching a 3 - disk e 3 to ODOP4 by a map S 2 → ODOP4 of degree 2 makes sense and products a new space X = DODOP4 .
Construct the loop space OX = ODODOP4 = Ω ( DODOP4 ) .
Exercise : Compute the first homology groups of OX = ODODOP4 .
The Kenzo program spent almost exactly two months to compute H i ( OX ) for i ≤ 7 .
The space OX is quite artificial , not so complicated but designed to accumulate some known difficulties : the space P4 is not a suspension ; the influence of attaching a disk by a non-trivial attaching map before looping is a difficult subject , so far without algorithmic solution ; the loop functor is applied three times .
The point is that most topologists think a spectral sequence is an algorithm computing the desired homology groups and this example is designed to convince them there is in fact some essential gap ; they are invited to propose an algorithm computing these homology groups through the usual Eilenberg - Moore spectral sequence ; even a " theoretical " algorithm would be enough , we do not think the exact value of these groups has much interest …
On the contrary , the methods of effective homology allow the user to design an algorithm computing the effective homology of a loop space when the effective homology of the initial space is given .
And the ordinary homology is a by - product of effective homology .
So that the recipe is : starting from the effective homology of the initial space , here P4 , therefore trivial , compute the effective homology of the intermediate spaces , and when the final space is reached , you can deduce the ordinary homology groups .
Results : H 0 ( OX ) = Z. H 1 ( OX ) = Z/2Z . H 2 ( OX ) = ( Z/2Z ) 2 + Z. H 3 ( OX ) = ( Z/2Z ) 4 + Z/8 Z . H 4 ( OX ) = ( Z/2Z ) 10 + Z/4Z + Z 2 . H 5 ( OX ) = ( Z/2Z ) 23 + Z/8Z + Z/16 Z. H 6 ( OX ) = ( Z/2Z ) 52 + ( Z/4Z ) 3 + Z 3 H 7 ( OX ) = ( Z/2Z ) 113 + Z/4Z + ( Z/8Z ) 3 + Z /16Z + Z/32Z + Z

Before the Kenzo program ( 1998 ) , the EAT program was written in 1990 by Julio Rubio and FS .
It was the first program ever written implementing spectral sequences , in fact only some particular cases of the Eilenberg - Moore spectral sequence .
The goal was the computation of the first homology groups of some loop spaces , for which no algorithm was previously concretely available .
An implementation rather primitive , just designed to illustrate our methods of Effective Homology by a concrete experimental program .
The EAT program is also studied by logicians and computer scientists .
Those possibly interested can download the EAT - program and its documentation .
Scientists at the University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign have again broken their own speed record for the world 's fastest transistor .
With a frequency of 845 gigahertz , their latest device is approximately 300 gigahertz faster than transistors built by other research groups , and approaches the goal of a terahertz device .
Made from indium phosphide and indium gallium arsenide , " the new transistor utilizes a pseudomorphic grading of the base and collector regions , " said Milton Feng , the Holonyak Chair Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Illinois .
" The compositional grading of these components enhances the electron velocity , hence , reduces both current density and charging time . "
With their latest device , Feng and his research group have taken the transistor to a new range of high - speed operation , bringing the " Holy Grail " of a terahertz transistor finally within reach .
Faster transistors translate into faster computers , more flexible and secure wireless communications systems , and more effective combat systems .
In addition to using pseudomorphic material construction , the researchers also refined their fabrication process to produce tinier transistor components .
For example , the transistor 's base is only 12.5 nanometers thick ( a nanometer is one billionth of a meter , or about 10,000 times smaller than the width of a human hair ) .
" By scaling the device vertically , we have reduced the distance electrons have to travel , resulting in an increase in transistor speed , " said graduate student William Snodgrass , who will describe the new device at the International Electronics Device Meeting in San Francisco , Dec. 11 - 13 .
" Because the size of the collector has also been reduced laterally , the transistor can charge and discharge faster . "

Operated at room temperature ( 25 degrees Celsius ) , the transistor speed is 765 gigahertz .
Chilled to minus 55 degrees Celsius , the speed increases to 845 gigahertz .
Feng , Snodgrass and graduate student Walid Hafez ( now at Intel Corp. ) fabricated the high - speed device in the university 's Micro and Nanotechnology Laboratory .
In addition to further increasing the transistor speed , Feng wants to reduce the current density even more , which will reduce junction temperature and improve device reliability .
The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency funded the work .
So a few months ago I sent out an email to the entire membership in which I said :
1 ) No , the store is not dead , though it may have appeared so .
Pandemonium has in fact moved to Central Square , Cambridge , and now is open for business .
2 ) The move was unexpectedly traumatic , owing to the fact that we were closed for over three months .
3 ) While we had kept our core customers , the store had taken on a lot more debt than was really healthy for it , but we would persevere .
As it turns out , I was overly optimistic .
There were more grinding noises from with the store over the last few months , and so I had to severely lighten our overhead by letting most of our people go .
The good news is that the store is now operationally in the black .
The bad news is that the amount of debt the store has is rather staggering .
Not only is interest a problem , but all my creditors are ( very politely but very insistently ) asking for their money all at the same time .
Lastly , there is the large amount of back taxes that Pandemonium owes on a State and Federal level .
So , ouch .
I have been in contact with Pandemonium ’s vendors , and have been able to work out repayment plans that should work assuming I can keep store revenues up during the winter months .
In that regard , I will be putting into play a number of new things that will , I hope , get us through the winter .
However , the owed back taxes are a major problem .
If the store ca n’t get those paid off Very Soon , I do n’t see how it can survive .
Tomorrow , a gentleman from the IRS will be coming by the store .
I am going to need to convince him that Pandemonium will be able to pay the taxes it currently owes .
Otherwise , things will get very sticky very quickly .
And so I have a cunning , if desperate , Plan .
As was announced yesterday on Pandemonium ’s LJ blog ,
( http://community.livejournal.com/pandemonium_bks/78457.html?style=mine#cutid1), the store is going to be putting out a line of new t- shirts at a rate of one / month .
Not all of them are going to be “ store shirts ” ; we plan on doing just plain fun and arty shirts as well .
I have put together a t - shirt pre-ordering site here for our January and February shirts :
http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.asp?u=572903264719
If 1000 customers pre-order and buy a store shirt , the proceeds will be enough to pay my Federal ( and hopefully my State ) back taxes .
If 1000 customers do n’t pre-order the shirts , I ’ll probably start looking to roll up the business .
I ’ll consider every available option , but it ’s unlikely I will be able to keep the store afloat .
I realize that this sounds like sounds like the worst type of emotional blackmail : “ Buy a shirt , or the store gets it ! ”
But there is more to this than money .
Note that I am asking for one thousand PEOPLE to buy at least one store shirt , not for a thousand shirts to be sold .
I need a thousand people to take part in this .
The reason why is that I am now working 11 - 12 hours a day , six to seven days a week , for a salary that is not currently sufficient to meet my needs ( stupid , stupid , student loans ) .
I have fought to keep my little store alive for seventeen years , and I am prepared to fight for another seventeen years , as long as I know that Pandemonium is appreciated .
I need , need !
to know that at least one thousand people give a damn about the store .
Maybe this is how booksellers have their mid-life crisis .
Maybe it ’s these frigid February days that keep the store empty for hours at a time .
All I know is that I ’m 40 years old , the store is in serious trouble , and maybe this is the time to wrap up things and get a 9 - to - 5 job with weekends off , vacations and health plans .
But the thing is , I do love my store .
I love this life , these people !
I just need to know other people appreciate Pandemonium , at least a little .
The store has been the center of my life for seventeen years , so obviously it ’s important to me .
I just need to know that it ’s important to you .
With one thousand people , I can pay off Pandemonium ’s back taxes .
With one thousand people care , we have a real chance of getting through this .
With one thousand people , Key will become human .
With one thousand people , an angel gets its wings .
With one thousand people , Tinkerbell does n’t die .
With one thousand people , a thousand cats will wake up tomorrow morning , look around and realize that they are not supreme overlords of the world … yet .
Whatever happens , it has been a magnificent seventeen years , and I would like to thank all Pandemonium ’s employees and customers , past , present and future , for a wonderful ride .
I simply pray that it ’s not over yet .
Thanks so much ,

What really happened on Mars ?
From : Mike Jones < mbj@microsoft.com >

Subject : What really happened on Mars ?
THE PROBLEM
The Mars Pathfinder mission was widely proclaimed as " flawless " in the early days after its July 4th , 1997 landing on the Martian surface .
Successes included its unconventional " landing " -- bouncing onto the Martian surface surrounded by airbags , deploying the Sojourner rover , and gathering and transmitting voluminous data back to Earth , including the panoramic pictures that were such a hit on the Web .
But a few days into the mission , not long after Pathfinder started gathering meteorological data , the spacecraft began experiencing total system resets , each resulting in losses of data .
The press reported these failures in terms such as " software glitches " and " the computer was trying to do too many things at once " .
This week at the IEEE Real - Time Systems Symposium I heard a fascinating keynote address by David Wilner , Chief Technical Officer of Wind River Systems .
Wind River makes VxWorks , the real - time embedded systems kernel that was used in the Mars Pathfinder mission .
In his talk , he explained in detail the actual software problems that caused the total system resets of the Pathfinder spacecraft , how they were diagnosed , and how they were solved .
I wanted to share his story with each of you .
VxWorks provides preemptive priority scheduling of threads .
Tasks on the Pathfinder spacecraft were executed as threads with priorities that were assigned in the usual manner reflecting the relative urgency of these tasks .
Pathfinder contained an " information bus " , which you can think of as a shared memory area used for passing information between different components of the spacecraft .
A bus management task ran frequently with high priority to move certain kinds of data in and out of the information bus .
Access to the bus was synchronized with mutual exclusion locks ( mutexes ) .
The meteorological data gathering task ran as an infrequent , low priority thread , and used the information bus to publish its data .
When publishing its data , it would acquire a mutex , do writes to the bus , and release the mutex .
If an interrupt caused the information bus thread to be scheduled while this mutex was held , and if the information bus thread then attempted to acquire this same mutex in order to retrieve published data , this would cause it to block on the mutex , waiting until the meteorological thread released the mutex before it could continue .
The spacecraft also contained a communications task that ran with medium priority .
Most of the time this combination worked fine .
However , very infrequently it was possible for an interrupt to occur that caused the ( medium priority ) communications task to be scheduled during the short interval while the ( high priority ) information bus thread was blocked waiting for the ( low priority ) meteorological data thread .
In this case , the long - running communications task , having higher priority than the meteorological task , would prevent it from running , consequently preventing the blocked information bus task from running .
After some time had passed , a watchdog timer would go off , notice that the data bus task had not been executed for some time , conclude that something had gone drastically wrong , and initiate a total system reset .
This scenario is a classic case of priority inversion .
HOW WAS THIS DEBUGGED ?
VxWorks can be run in a mode where it records a total trace of all interesting system events , including context switches , uses of synchronization objects , and interrupts .
After the failure , JPL engineers spent hours and hours running the system on the exact spacecraft replica in their lab with tracing turned on , attempting to replicate the precise conditions under which they believed that the reset occurred .
Early in the morning , after all but one engineer had gone home , the engineer finally reproduced a system reset on the replica .
Analysis of the trace revealed the priority inversion .
HOW WAS THE PROBLEM CORRECTED ?
When created , a VxWorks mutex object accepts a boolean parameter that indicates whether priority inheritance should be performed by the mutex .
The mutex in question had been initialized with the parameter off ; had it been on , the low - priority meteorological thread would have inherited the priority of the high - priority data bus thread blocked on it while it held the mutex , causing it be scheduled with higher priority than the medium - priority communications task , thus preventing the priority inversion .
Once diagnosed , it was clear to the JPL engineers that using priority inheritance would prevent the resets they were seeing .
VxWorks contains a C language interpreter intended to allow developers to type in C expressions and functions to be executed on the fly during system debugging .
The JPL engineers fortuitously decided to launch the spacecraft with this feature still enabled .
By coding convention , the initialization parameter for the mutex in question ( and those for two others which could have caused the same problem ) were stored in global variables , whose addresses were in symbol tables also included in the launch software , and available to the C interpreter .
A short C program was uploaded to the spacecraft , which when interpreted , changed the values of these variables from FALSE to TRUE .
No more system resets occurred .
ANALYSIS AND LESSONS
First and foremost , diagnosing this problem as a black box would have been impossible .
Only detailed traces of actual system behavior enabled the faulty execution sequence to be captured and identified .
Secondly , leaving the " debugging " facilities in the system saved the day .
Without the ability to modify the system in the field , the problem could not have been corrected .
Finally , the engineer 's initial analysis that " the data bus task executes very frequently and is time - critical -- we should n't spend the extra time in it to perform priority inheritance " was exactly wrong .
It is precisely in such time critical and important situations where correctness is essential , even at some additional performance cost .
HUMAN NATURE , DEADLINE PRESSURES
David told us that the JPL engineers later confessed that one or two system resets had occurred in their months of pre-flight testing .
They had never been reproducible or explainable , and so the engineers , in a very human - nature response of denial , decided that they probably were n't important , using the rationale " it was probably caused by a hardware glitch " .
Part of it too was the engineers ' focus .
They were extremely focused on ensuring the quality and flawless operation of the landing software .
Should it have failed , the mission would have been lost .
It is entirely understandable for the engineers to discount occasional glitches in the less - critical land - mission software , particularly given that a spacecraft reset was a viable recovery strategy at that phase of the mission .
THE IMPORTANCE OF GOOD THEORY / ALGORITHMS
David also said that some of the real heroes of the situation were some people from CMU who had published a paper he'd heard presented many years ago who first identified the priority inversion problem and proposed the solution .
He apologized for not remembering the precise details of the paper or who wrote it .
Bringing things full circle , it turns out that the three authors of this result were all in the room , and at the end of the talk were encouraged by the program chair to stand and be acknowledged .
They were Lui Sha , John Lehoczky , and Raj Rajkumar .
When was the last time you saw a room of people cheer a group of computer science theorists for their significant practical contribution to advancing human knowledge ? :-)
It was quite a moment .

DATING is fraught with disappointments , so you can imagine how delighted a single woman might be to find someone like Albert Podell — particularly after she Googles him and learns how rich he is .
Last year , Mr. Podell , a 70 - year - old lawyer , gave N.Y.U. Law School $ 2.9 million .
He goes out four nights a week , to the opera , symphony or theater .
He is well read .
He says he has traveled to 162 countries .
Then comes that magic evening when the woman is ready to go back to his place .
“ It ’s totally unchanged , like it was when I went to law school in 1973 , a time warp , ” Mr. Podell says of his small one - bedroom in SoHo , a description that seems plausible , given the hot pink living room with the futon seating and the fraying contact paper on the kitchen cabinets .
The place is also dimly lighted , which , once you examine the kitchen nook in daylight , is probably not such a bad thing .
The cabinets hold nothing but a six - month supply of powdered milk for Mr. Podell ’s cereal , so that he can keep his trips to the supermarket to a minimum ; the Formica countertop is peeling ; the stove has been disconnected from the gas feed .
( Mr. Podell , who usually eats out , sees no reason to waste fuel . )
All these things have proved detriments to love , but none so effectively as his sheets .
Mr. Podell likes the ones from the ’60s and ’ 70s that tell a story : sheets with intergalactic battles or pink hippopotami or the Beatles .
Since these are no longer available in adult - bed sizes , Mr. Podell ’s sheets are now 30 to 40 years old .
The fading is such that a person who saw one in a Salvation Army bin , having lost everything she owned in a fire , would remind herself that there was no reason to be desperate .
The fading , however , was apparently not the reason that the sheets became a deal breaker .
If you ’re still harboring the notion that the economy is “ good , ” prepare to be disabused .
Even the best number from yesterday ’s Census Bureau report for 2005 is bad news for most Americans .
It shows that median income rose 1.1 percent last year , to $ 46,326 , the first increase since it peaked in 1999 .
But the entire increase is attributable to the 23 million households headed by someone over age 65 .
So the gain is likely from investment income and Social Security , not wages and salaries .
For the other 91 million households , the median dropped , by half a percent , or $ 275 .
Incomes for the under - 65 crowd were hurt by a decline in wages and salaries among full - time working men for the second year in a row , and among full - time working women for the third straight year .
In all , median income for the under - 65 group was $ 2,000 lower in 2005 than in 2001 , when the last recession bottomed out .
Despite the Bush - era expansion , the number of Americans living in poverty in 2005  37 million  was the same as in 2004 .
This is the first time the number has not risen since 2000 .
But the share of the population now in poverty  12.6 percent  is still higher than at the trough of the last recession , when it was 11.7 percent .
And among the poor , 43 percent were living below half the poverty line in 2005  $ 7,800 for a family of three .
That ’s the highest percentage of people in “ deep poverty ” since the government started keeping track of those numbers in 1975 .
As for the uninsured , their ranks grew in 2005 by 1.3 million people , to a record 46.6 million , or 15.9 percent .
That ’s also worse than the recession year 2001 , reflecting the rising costs of health coverage and a dearth of initiatives to help families and companies cope with the burden .
For the first time since 1998 , the percentage of uninsured children increased in 2005 .

The alternative view that man was the one hunted was suggested
Instead , they argue , early humans were on the menu for predatory beasts .
This may have driven humans to evolve increased levels of co-operation , according to their theory .
Despite humankind 's considerable capacity for war and violence , we are highly sociable animals , according to anthropologists .
James Rilling , at Emory University in Atlanta , US , has been using brain imaging techniques to investigate the biological mechanisms behind co-operation .
He has imaged the brains of people playing a game under experimental conditions that involved choosing between co-operation and non-co-operation .
From the parts of the brain that were activated during the game , he found that mutual co-operation is rewarding ; people reacted negatively when partners did not co-operate .
Dr Rilling also discovered that his subjects seemed to have enhanced memory for those people that did not reciprocate in the experiment .
Man ' the hunted '
By contrast , our closest relatives - chimpanzees - have been shown not to come to the aid of others , even when it would pose no cost to themselves .
" Our intelligence , co-operation and many other features we have as modern humans developed from our attempts to out - smart the predator , " said Robert Sussman of Washington University in St Louis .
According to the theory espoused by Professor Sussman , early humans evolved not as hunters but as prey for animals such as wild dogs , cats , hyenas , eagles and crocodiles .
He points to the example of one ape - like species thought to be ancestral to humans , Australopithecus afarensis .
A. afarensis was what is known as an " edge species " ; it could live in trees and on the ground , and could take advantage of both .
" Primates that are edge species , even today , are basically prey species , not predators , " Professor Sussman explained .
Hard target
Dr Agustin Fuentes at the University of Notre Dame agrees with the predation hypothesis .
He believes early humans were subject to several evolutionary pressures , including predation .
But he also thinks they were expending more energy at this time and that child - rearing became more demanding .
All these factors contributed to an emergence of sociable behaviour in hominids that made them harder targets for predators .
Dr Fuentes points to fossil evidence of predation in two different groups of humanlike species : Australopithecus and Paranthropus .
The latter group , it appears , could not adapt to pressures such as predation , and became extinct between one and 1.2 million years ago .
The scientists outlined their work at the American Association for the Advancement of Science annual meeting in St Louis , US .

BBC News , Murmansk , Russia
Russia 's submarine fleet marks its centenary this week
For almost half a century , the Northern Fleet has operated two - thirds of the navy 's nuclear - powered vessels .
Much of the spent fuel from these vessels has been dumped directly into the Barents and Kara seas , with the remainder placed in vastly inadequate storage .
Wasteland
A journey west along the Kola Peninsula 's rugged Barents Sea coastline displays a natural beauty that belies the harsh realities lying hidden below the choppy surface .
About halfway between Severomorsk and the Norwegian border lies Andreeva Bay , an environmental nightmare where the waters are completely devoid of life .
Leaks from the region 's largest nuclear waste storage facility mean no fish will ever swim in this fjord .
Onshore , both the soil and the groundwater are badly contaminated .
On this vast site , 32 tons of highly radioactive waste with a high uranium content is stored in crumbling concrete bunkers and rusting tanks and containers - about a third of the nuclear waste mountain that can be found on the Kola Peninsula .
Most of it is spent fuel from the Northern Fleet 's nuclear powered submarines , some from nuclear powered ice breakers .
And these days nobody , not even the officials in charge , suggests it is safe .
Spent nuclear fuel rods are not stored safely .

" This is the biggest environmental threat facing the Murmansk region today , " according to Andrei Zolotkov , director of local green group Bellona .
" The amount of radioactivity is equivalent to 93 submarine reactors , or comparable with Chernobyl . "
Patient campaigner
Mr Zolotkov 's warning attracts attention in Murmansk , where he is seen as an authority on this matter .
Not only is he a former crew member of both nuclear - powered ice breakers and service ships unloading spent nuclear fuel from submarines , he is also a former member of Russia 's parliament , the Duma , during Soviet times .
He has long worked for the radiation safety department at Murmansk Shipping Company , which operates both nuclear - powered ships and nuclear storage facilities .
But most importantly , Mr Zolotkov was among those who first raised the alarm back in the 1990s and he has been campaigning for a solution ever since .
Last week there was a breakthrough - the first public hearing of its kind , held in a former Communist Party building in the centre of Murmansk .
The hearing into the Andreeva waste problem was well attended
More than a decade of campaigning has resulted in an action plan for dealing with the nuclear waste mountain at Andreeva Bay , so at last the people of Murmansk have been told face - to - face what they have known for years .
" All installations are degrading and in poor condition and pollution levels are increasing , not decreasing , " a SevRao official says .
Mounting task ahead
The people of Murmansk thus faces a stark choice .
leave the waste where it is and face guaranteed disaster go in to clean it up , move it to proper and permanent storage facilities or transport it to a reprocessing plant
Both technical and economic assistance will come from the Kola Peninsula 's northern neighbours , as well as from London , Brussels and Washington , to construct buildings and storage facilities .
But Russia will take on the massive operating costs and the task of actually shifting the waste over the next six years , a challenge that will involve a string of potentially lethal operations .
Remote - controlled machines will be used to load the waste into sealed transport containers .
Much of the waste will be taken to Murmansk , where it will be encapsulated for long - term storage in a new , modern storage facility .
Waste that can be reprocessed will be sent south from Murmansk to Mayak , hundreds of kilometres away in the Urals .
And herein lies the crux of the dilemma facing local people : there is no railway line to Andreeva Bay , and the road is unsafe .
Thus the only solution is to use ships to transport the waste , straight into and through the heart of Murmansk .
For years the locals will have to live with the knowledge that several hundred nuclear waste shipments will pass through the increasingly busy port , where some of it will be put into permanent storage .
The rest of the waste will be reloaded onto specially built trains with armed guards that will pass through the city on its journey across the Kola Peninsula , where it will pass several remote towns .
And for the Kola Peninsula 's people this is just the beginning , as it begins to tackle a nuclear waste mountain weighing almost 100 tons .
Risks will have to be taken , tough choices must be made .
But as Mr Zolotkov points out : " If we do nothing , the situation will only get worse " .
Oh , I love this .
LOVE it .
I can't think of anything that would derail the right wing noise machine than bringing back the Fairness Doctrine .
Can you imagine how much Fox News would have to revamp their programming ?
It would be unrecognizable .
And get this : Tim Russert might actually have to invite Democratic officials on Meet The Press !
The mind reels at the possibilities .

Over the weekend , the National Conference for Media Reform was held in Memphis , TN , with a number of notable speakers on hand for the event .
Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) made an surprise appearance at the convention to announce that he would be heading up a new House subcommittee which will focus on issues surrounding the Federal Communications Commission .
The Presidential candidate said that the committee would be holding " hearings to push media reform right at the center of Washington . "
The Domestic Policy Subcommittee of the House Government Reform Committee was to be officially announced this week in Washington , D.C. , but Kucinich opted to make the news public early .
In addition to media ownership , the committee is expected to focus its attention on issues such as net neutrality and major telecommunications mergers .
Also in consideration is the " Fairness Doctrine , " which required broadcasters to present controversial topics in a fair and honest manner .
It was enforced until it was eliminated in 1987 .
Kucinich said in his speech that " We know the media has become the servant of a very narrow corporate agenda " and added " we are now in a position to move a progressive agenda to where it is visible . "
Evolutionary change is generally considered to be a pedestrian affair , with changes occurring over millennia .
But evolutionary biologists from Harvard have shown that natural selection can occur within months , as a population ’s needs change .
Their study , appearing in the journal Science , was based on populations of the lizard Anolis sagrei that inhabits cays ( small islands ) in the Bahamas , and what happened when a new predator was introduced .
The scientists found that natural selection dramatically reversed direction over a very short period , first favoring longer , and then shorter , hind legs .
Experiments where researchers are able to witness evolution in action have been something of a rarity .
“ Recent work has shown , however , that evolutionary biology can be studied on short time scales and that predictions about it can be tested experimentally .
We predicted , and then demonstrated , a reversal in the direction of natural selection acting on limb length in a population of lizards , ” explained Harvard ’s Jonathan B. Losos .
Losos ’ experiment involved introducing a predatory lizard ( ) into some of the cays , while keeping six other control cays predator - free .
The populations of both were sets of cays were counted , marked , and measured lizards prior to the introduction of the predators .
The indigenous lizard ( Anolis sagrei ) spends much of its time on the ground , but when a terrestrial predator is introduced , it takes to trees and shrubs , becoming increasingly arboreal over time .
Losos and his colleagues hypothesized that immediately following a predator ’s introduction longer - legged – and hence faster - running – Anolis lizards would be favored to elude capture .
However , as the lizards grew ever more arboreal in habitat , the scientists projected that natural selection would begin to favor shorter limbs , which are better suited to navigating narrow branches and twigs .
In striking fashion , the researcher ’s hypothesis was borne out .
Six months after the introduction of the predator , Losos found that the Anolis population had dropped by half or more on the islands with the predators , and in comparison to the lizards on the predator - free islands , long legs were more strongly favored : Survivors had longer legs relative to non-survivors .
After another six months , during which time the Anolis lizards grew increasingly arboreal , selective pressures were exactly the opposite : Survivors were now characterized by having shorter legs on the experimental islands as compared to the control islands .
The behavioral shift from the ground to higher perches apparently caused this dramatic reversal , Losos explained , adding that behavioral flexibility may often drive extremely rapid shifts in evolution .
“ Evolutionary biology is by its nature an historical science , but the combination of microevolutionary experimentation and macroevolutionary historical analysis can provide a rich understanding about the genesis of biological diversity , ” he added .

Do n’t you just love proving people wrong by doing what is supposed to be impossible ?
My own personal triumph was beating the Saltine myth – I was once told that it was impossible to eat seven Saltines in a minute , and after a few attempts , I was able to prove them wrong ( as well as ensure that I ’ll never want to eat a Saltine again ) .
I then proceeded to lick my elbows and say “ toy boat ” ten times quickly .
It ’s all possible , even though many do n’t believe it .
However , there ’s one challenge I have never been able to figure out – how to fold a piece of paper more than eight times .
I have heard it stated as fact that one cannot fold a paper in half more than eight times , because the doubled and re-doubled paper quickly becomes too thick .
This reasoning had always seemed pretty odd to me – what was this magical property of hardened tree pulp that caused it to stop folding after so long ?
Thanks to a student named Britney Gallivan , it turns out that this impossibility is just as mythical as not being able to lick your elbows .
By developing her own formulae for paper folding , she calculated how much paper one needs to achieve any number of folds ( and herself managed to break world records by folding a piece of paper twelve times ) .
It all started Gallivan ’s junior year of high school in 2001 when she was given an extra credit challenge for math – fold a piece of paper twelve times .
( Do n’t you love it when teachers give you extra credit for what they assume is an impossible task ? )
She figured that either the paper had to be quite wide , or very thin ; she went with the latter for her first attempt .
Using some precise tools , she was able accomplish the feat using gold foil , which is only eleven millionths of an inch thick .
Of course , this was not good enough for the teacher , who insisted that something with of the thickness of paper should be used for the challenge .
Back to the drawing board , Gallivan now had to calculate how big of a sheet of paper she needed in order to fold it twelve times .
First , she specified what a paper with n folds was , based upon the layers seen in the paper .
One fold would have two layers , two folds would have four layers , three folds would have eight , and so on ; in other words , n folds meant 2^n layers .
She also determined the equations for how much paper was needed for folding , based upon the way paper folds .
She came up with equations for both alternating and single - direction folding ( alternating is what some people call “ hamburger - hotdog ” folding , whereas single - direction keeps folding the same point over and over again ) .
For single - direction folding , the equation is :
Where L is the minimum possible length of the material , t is material thickness , and n is the number of folds possible in one direction .
L and t must be the same unit .
For alternate - directional folding , the equation is :
Where W is the width of a square piece of paper and n is the number of paper folds .
This equation is not exact , but gives a close approximation of the limits for paper size .
If one looks at her equations and the thickness of a basic 8.5 ″ by 11 ″ paper , it makes sense that it was thought that folding a paper more than eight times would be impossible .
However , instead of being impossible , it ’s merely a problem that gets exponentially more difficult with each iteration .
Think about the story where a king pays an artist a penny for his first day of work , two pennies on the second , and so on – by the end of a month , the artist is making more than a million dollars a day .
The paper folding problem is equally distressing as the king ’s future debt to the artist .
Ultimately , Gallivan discovered that for a large number of folds , single - direction folding required less paper .
However , in order to achieve her teacher ’s required twelve folds , Gallivan would need a 4,000 foot - long piece of paper .
She eventually found a roll of special toilet paper that matched the job , and set out to break a record .
Unrolling the paper in a mall at her hometown in Pomona , California , she and her parents went to task .
After seven long hours of folding their hearts out , the three successfully executed twelve folds , shattering the previous world record .
For her efforts , Gallivan received her extra credit , and in the process she changed the world in an indiscernible but distinct way .
As for the generations of people who have asserted that such a feat is impossible , Britney proved them wrong once and for all .
It ’s amazing what you can accomplish with a little imagination , a double - helping of ambition , and an industrial - sized roll of toilet paper .

The Case for the Libertarian Democrat
It was my fealty to the notion of personal liberty that made me a Republican when I came of age in the 1980s .
It is my continued fealty to personal liberty that makes me a Democrat today .
The case against the libertarian Republican is so easy to make that I almost feel compelled to stipulate it and move on .
It is the case for the libertarian Democrat that has created much discussion and not a small amount of controversy when I first introduced the notion in what was , in reality , a throwaway blog post on Daily Kos on a slow news day in early June 2006 .
But that post — as coarse , raw , and incomplete as it was — touched a surprising nerve .
It generated the predictable criticism from libertarian circles ( Reason and several Cato scholars piled on ) as well as from conservatives who perhaps recognized their own slipping grasp of libertarian principles but were unwilling to cede any ground to a liberal .
But more surprising ( and unexpected ) to me was the positive reaction : there ’s a whole swath of Americans who are uncomfortable with Republican / conservative efforts to erode our civil liberties while intruding into our bedrooms and churches ; they do n’t like unaccountable corporations invading their privacy , holding undue control over their economic fortunes , and despoiling our natural surroundings ; yet they also do n’t appreciate the nanny state , the over - regulation of small businesses , the knee - jerk distrust of the free market , or the meddlesome intrusions into mundane personal matters .
Like me , these were people who did n’t instinctively reject the ability of government to protect our personal liberties , who saw government as a good , not an evil , but did n’t necessarily see the government as the source of first resort when seeking solutions to problems facing our country .
They also saw the markets as a good , not an evil , but did n’t necessarily see an unregulated market run amok as a positive thing .
Some of these were reluctant Republicans , seeking an excuse to abandon a party that has failed them .
Others were reluctant Democrats , looking for a reason to fully embrace their party .
And still others were stuck in the middle , despairing at their options — despondent at a two - party system in which both parties were committed to Big Government principles .
That blog post on libertarian Democrats , imperfect as it was , struck a chord .
But it was n’t written in a vacuum .
It stemmed not from theory or philosophy ( I ’m neither a theorist , political scientist , nor a philosopher ) , but from personal experience and from my excitement at the growing ranks of Western Democrats who are n’t just transforming the politics of the Mountain states , but will hopefully lead to the reformation of the Democratic Party and a new embrace of the politics of personal liberty .
Not Your Libertarian ’s Libertarianism
The modern libertarian ( and conservative ) view has been that government is an evil , perhaps necessary , but still a grave threat to personal liberties requiring the utmost vigilance against its instincts for perpetual expansion .
The larger government grows , the more it infringes on our personal space , inevitably placing limits on our freedoms .
And given government ’s police powers , that threat is grave indeed .
There ’s a reason libertarians view the Second Amendment as an absolute right — its abolition would limit one of the most effective ages - old tools against governmental tyranny .
Hence , there was ( and is ) a natural tension between liberals who see government as a benign force for good , and those who can point to plenty of history showing otherwise .
And as long as government remained the greatest threat to our personal liberties , this tension was fated to remain .
Republicans , out - of - power for much of the 20th century , and livid at the Democrats ’ expansion of government , spoke of shrinking government and limiting its power .
Libertarians , while not exactly perfect allies of the GOP , were likely to get more of what they sought by making common cause with conservatives than liberals .
But that began to change as the power of corporations grew .
As the pseudonymous user “ hekebolos ” wrote in a Daily Kos diary :
Up until even very recently , it was still definitely possible to construe government as [ the ] largest threat to individual liberty .
It was n’t very long ago that “ what was good for GM was good for the USA . ”
Government regulation of corporations was seen as interfering with the prosperity of the average American .
You see , the libertarian / conservative idea behind the primacy of the free market was that there would always be an intersection between what was good for business and what was good for the consumer .
But that correlation was far greater in years past than it is today .
The fundamental reason that “ libertarian ” has become “ libertarian democrat ” is that corporations are becoming more powerful than governments .
This fundamental fact has created a union between those with libertarian tendencies and those who believed all along that government can be a force for good .
As hekebolos further noted , defense contractors now have greater say in what weapons systems get built ( via their lobbyists , blackmailing elected officials by claiming that jobs will be lost in their states and districts if weapons system X gets axed ) .
The energy industry dominates the executive branch and has reaped record windfall profits .
Our public debt is now held increasingly by private hedge funds .
Corporations foul our air and water .
They plunder our treasury .
This list , I ’m sure , could be added to .
Oil and oil services companies can even dictate when and how the most powerful nation on earth decides to go to war .
A cabal of major corporate industry is , in fact , more powerful than the government of the most powerful nation on earth–and government is the only thing that can stop them from recklessly exploiting the people and destroying their freedom .
That , in essence , is why I am a Democrat , and why my original blog post on libertarian Democrats struck a chord with so many .
We cherish freedom , and will embrace any who would protect it .
But that necessarily includes , in this day and age , the government .
The Conservative War on Freedom
We can fondly look back to a time when Republicans spoke a good game on libertarian issues .
They professed fealty to state rights , spoke of shrinking the government , preserving individual liberty , and embracing fiscal responsibility .
A report by Cato ’s director of budget studies Stephen Slivinski highlights the truth about GOP efforts .
President Bush has presided over the largest overall increase in inflation - adjusted federal spending since Lyndon B. Johnson .
Even after excluding spending on defense and homeland security , Bush is still the biggest - spending president in 30 years .
His 2006 budget does n’t cut enough spending to change his place in history , either .
Total government spending grew by 33 percent during Bush ’s first term .
The federal budget as a share of the economy grew from 18.5 percent of GDP on Clinton ’s last day in office to 20.3 percent by the end of Bush ’s first term .
The Republican Congress has enthusiastically assisted the budget bloat .
Inflation - adjusted spending on the combined budgets of the 101 largest programs they vowed to eliminate in 1995 has grown by 27 percent .
This spending is all the more remarkable given that Republicans control all three branches of government .
We are seeing Republican conservative governance exactly how it is supposed to work .
On social issues , we are seeing a government aggressively seeking to meddle in people ’s bedrooms , doctor ’s offices , and churches .
They want to dictate when life begins , when life ends , and which consenting adults can marry .
They want to pass a new Amendment eliminating the non-existent threat posed by flag burning — a serious effort to limit the freedoms protected by the First Amendment .
And the long - time Republican dodge on such issues — that it merely wanted to let the states decide such issues — was exposed as hogwash by the Schiavo fiasco .
While the Washington Post had no on - the - record source for the following assertion , they did n’t need one .
Actions spoke louder than words :
Republicans acknowledged that the intervention was a departure from their usual support for states ’ rights .
But they said their views about the sanctity of life trumped their views about federalism .
The nation ’s current wars have given conservatives yet more excuses to make a mockery of the protections we supposedly enjoy under the Bill of Rights , from the PATRIOT Act , to the NSA spying on American citizens , to violations of habeas corpus .
Republicans seem to have even abandoned even more fundamental Constitutional principles , such as “ separation of powers . ”
As chief Bush legal theorist John
Yoo wrote in his book , War by Other Means :
We are used to a peacetime system in which Congress enacts the laws , the president enforces them , and the courts interpret them .
In wartime , the gravity shifts to the executive branch .
This is n’t a party committed to anyone ’s personal freedoms .
Embracing the market
In the waning years of the Clinton Administration , the Justice Department waged a massive anti-trust battle against Microsoft .
At the time , Microsoft seemed unstoppable , a monopolistic behemoth who would either swallow or crush anyone that posed even the most minute threat to its business .
I cheered the Justice Department on , thinking its efforts would be the only thing to dent the prospects of a Microsoft - dominated world .
I was despondent when Microsoft emerged victorious .
Innovation seemed dead .
But I was dead wrong .
What a difference a few years made .
As the Internet came on the scene , first Yahoo then Google transformed the technological landscape leaving Microsoft in their wake .
The market shifted , and Microsoft was n’t able to make the transition .
Despite being a dominant player in PCs and office software , no one fears Microsoft anymore .
It is a remnant of a different era , reduced to providing commodity products as other companies blaze new trails .
The market worked on its own .
My libertarian tendencies have always found a welcome home in the Silicon Valley culture ( and in all of the nation ’s great technology centers ) .
It is a place where hard work and good ideas trump pedigree , money , the color of one ’s skin , nationality , sex , or any of the artificial barriers to entry in most of the rest of the world .
It is a techno - utopia that , while oft - criticized for a streak of self - important narcissism , still today produces the greatest innovations in technology in the world .
Where else could such a motley collection of school dropouts , nerds , brown people ( mostly Indian ) , and non-Native English speakers ( mostly Chinese ) , not just rise to the top of their game , but dominate it ?
This is free market activity seemingly at its best , and it works precisely because these individuals are able to take risks and be judged by the results of their work , rather than be judged by who they are , where they ’ve been , or who they know .
But there are other reasons why this outpost of libertarianism works .
The government has put in an infrastructure to support the region including , among many other things , roads , the Internet , government research grants , and the most important ingredient of all : education , from the lowliest kindergarten to the highest post - doc program .
Such spending , while requiring a government bureaucracy that makes a traditional libertarian shudder , actually provides the tools that individuals need to succeed in today ’s world .
If our goal is to promote and champion individual liberty and the free market , we need government to help provide those tools to all Americans , not just a privileged few .
This is n’t a question of equality , it ’s one of opportunity .
Some people will take advantage of those opportunities , and others will not .
That will be up to each individual .
But without opportunity , there is no freedom .
There is also no individual freedom if corporations are n’t forced to provide the kind of accountability necessary to ensure we make proper purchasing or investment decisions .
For example , public corporations are regulated to ensure that investors have accurate data upon which to base their trading decisions .
If investors ca n’t trust the information given by corporations , the stock markets could n’t function .
If the stock markets could n’t function , our current market system would collapse .
Matters such as deceptive advertising , labeling , and some safety regulations are also important .
Does anyone doubt that requiring food companies to label ingredients and nutritional data does n’t enhance our liberties by giving us the information we need to make informed decisions ?
On the flip side , much of what ’s known as “ corporate welfare ” is not designed to protect personal liberties .
Rather it rewards inefficiencies in the market and the politically connected .
Intellectual property law protections , constantly extended at the behest of Walt Disney in service to its perpetual Mickey copyright , have created a corporate stranglehold over information in an era where information is currency .
Patent law allows companies like Amazon to patent simple and obvious “ business processes ” like “ one - click shopping , ” which they protect with armies of lawyers and deep pockets .
In the non-virtual sphere , cities use eminent domain to strip property owners of their rights on behalf of private developers .
So a “ free ” market needs rules ( “ regulation ” ) in order to function .
And such rules should be welcome so long as they are designed to enhance and protect our personal liberties .
The Rise of the Libertarian Democrat
In the fierce battle in this year ’s Montana Senate race , an attack ad by incumbent Republican Senator Conrad Burns against his Democratic challenger Jon Tester reminded me why I ’m excited about the rise of the libertarian Democrat .
The ad accuses Jon Tester of voting against a bill limiting pornography at public libraries .
Turns out that Tester voted against the bill because 1 ) public libraries already had solved the problem , and 2 ) the state law would have merely duplicated already - existing federal standards .
So Tester did what any sensible person should do : vote against an unnecessary and duplicative law .
While we can discuss what the ad says about Burns — that he is politically cynical and has betrayed small - government principles —
I ’d prefer to focus on what it said about Tester .
Casting a “ yes ” vote was as easy as pressing the “ yes ” button at his desk , but Tester was n’t going to grow state government without a compelling reason , even if it could have scored him cheap political points .
A Tester spokesperson responded to the charges , “ Jon Tester believes in less government regulation , not more , and he believes in local control . ”
At a debate , Burns charged that Tester would “ weaken the Patriot Act ” .
Tester fired back , ” I do n’t want to weaken the Patriot Act .
I want to repeal it . ”
This is the future face of the Democratic Party .
Mountain West Democrats are leading the charge .
At the vanguard is Montana Governor Brian Schweitzer , who won his governorship the same day George Bush was winning Montana 58 to 38 percent .
While the theme of Republican corruption played a big role in Schweitzer ’s victory , he also ran on a decidedly libertarian Democrat message and is now the second most popular governor in the country according to Survey USA ’s September 50 State poll .
In Wyoming , Democratic Governor Dave Freudenthal won in 2002 in this ridiculously conservative state by decrying policies allowing energy companies to violate landowner rights by setting up smelly , noisy , dirty machinery in their property to extract sub - surface minerals .
Republicans were content to let their energy industry benefactors discard even the most basic property rights .
This year , tech - industry Democrat Gary Trauner is making Republicans sweat the state ’s lone House seat ( once held by Dick Cheney ) that should be , by all rights , a cakewalk .
In eastern Washington , which has more in common with Idaho than with western Washington , Democrat Peter Goldmark is a serious threat .
Not to be outdone , just across the state line in Idaho ’s 1st Congressional District , Democrat Larry Grant is seriously contesting a seat in which Bush won with 70 percent of the vote .
And it ’s not just the Mountain West , either .
In Ohio , Paul Hackett narrowly lost a 2005 special election in the Ohio 2nd Congressional District , which Bush won with 63 percent of the vote in 2004 , after standing against government meddling in people ’s private lives .
In Virginia , impressive Democratic Senate candidate Jim Webb , a “ Reagan Democrat ” in the literal sense — he served as Ronald Reagan ’s Navy Secretary — is similarly pushing a message of personal liberties .
Incumbent Virginia Senator George Allen thought he’d be campaigning in Iowa and New Hampshire for the 2008 Republican presidential nomination .
Instead , he ’s in a fight for his life .
It is no coincidence that most of these transformative candidates are emerging in conservative areas .
The Mountain West , in particular , has a individualistic libertarian streak that has been utterly betrayed by the governing Republicans .
State legislatures in Alaska and Montana proudly voted to defy the PATRIOT Act .
But even in places like Ohio and Virginia , many traditionally Republican voters simply want to live their lives in peace , without undue meddling from unaccountable multinationals or the government .
For too long , Republicans promised smaller government and less intrusion in people ’s lives .
Yet with a government dominated top to bottom by Republicans , we ’ve seen the exact opposite .
No one will ever mistake a Democrat of just about any stripe for a doctrinaire libertarian .
But we ’ve seen that one party is now committed to subverting individual freedoms , while the other is growing increasingly comfortable with moving in a new direction , one in which restrained government , fiscal responsibility , and — most important of all — individual freedoms are paramount .
Summary
The interview begins with a brief description of his life and career in Spain .
Then it turns to the scandal at the World Championship match in Elista .
Topalov says there were " clear indications of cheating " in the way Kramnik went to the bathroom , came out and played instantly .
Cables were found in the ceiling of the bathroom , but the Topalov team kept quiet " for many reasons . "
Topalov specifies that " there were threats " , that the airport was closed and his team was worried how they could get out of Russia .
Topalov believes that Kramnik 's team did not know what was going on .
He was getting help not from them but from Russian who were not part of the chess world – from non-professional chess players or from the KGB .
But " the Kremlin will never admit they poisoned that Russian spy , which seems obvious , or Kramnik that he cheated . "
Topalov says he felt he was in physical danger and will not go back to Kalmykia again .
President Ilyumzhinov was not personally responsible for what transpired , he was acting on orders .
The method of cheating , says Topalov , was improved during the latter part of the match , and in fact played a decisive role in the tiebreak games .
There " they had a foolproof system " , and in the fourth game Kramnik " made a move that would only occur to a computer . "
Topalov guesses that his opponent was using an electronic device hidden on his body .
" With the technology the Russians have , Kramnik will be invincible in a match . "
Topalov believes that Kramnik wants to keep the title without defending it over the board , and predicts that he will not play in Mexico .
In the interview there is repeated mention of " cables " .
These were allegedly found in Kramnik 's bathroom early during the match .
We will follow up on this story .
For today the interview , which was carefully translated by Mig Greengard in Chess Ninja .
We have included the original Spanish for some of the key passages .
The interview was conducted for the Spanish daily newspaper ABC by Federico Marin Bellon in Bilbao , after the end of the blindfold match Topalov - Judit Polgar .
A link to the original interview is given at the bottom of this page .
" The Kremlin wo n't admit they killed that Russian spy or that Kramnik cheated . "
[ " Topalov : « El Kremlin nunca reconocerá que mató al espía ruso , ni Kramnik que hizo trampas » " ]
Interview by Federico Marin Bellon
Federico Marin :
How were your beginnings in Spain ?
Veselin Topalov :
It was a very romantic period .
Silvio Danailov and I came here because there were more tournaments .
Marin :
Were you already thinking about becoming champion ?
Topalov :
When you win the under - 14 world championship you know you 've got talent , but I did n't have such aspirations .
You could say you were a champion who came out of the streets .
Topalov :
Yes , I have a street - fighting style .
I spent a year playing in opens and we walked all over Spain .
We first met in 1994 , in Alcobendas , and success has n't changed you .
Topalov :
That 's the benefit of starting at the bottom .
How was the encounter with Kramnik ?
Topalov :
Very tense , although objectively speaking I dominated the majority of it .
What happened before the fifth game ?
Topalov :
We got the videos of what Kramnik was doing between every move .
He was going to the bathroom many times and his behavior was very suspicious .
They accuse you of trying to disturb him because he was winning .
Topalov :
We never wanted to stop the match .
There were clear indications of cheating [ " Había claros indicios de trampa " ] .
You look at that tape and it puts the fear into you .
It 's not just how many times he went to the bathroom , but how he went .
Many times he came out , came to the board and moved instantly .
He alleges health problems .
Topalov :
That 's a lie ( " Mentira " ) .
I drank more than he did and did n't go to the bathroom so often .
We protested , but the committee , which had sided with us , was fired .
They say it 's inconceivable that the rival team had access to private video .
Topalov :
They also saw my video .
They followed my every step and everyone who was with me .
And if he 's not doing anything wrong , what 's the problem ?
Illescas said you exaggerated , and lied , about the number of times Kramnik went to the bathroom .
Topalov : I do n't know how many times he went .
My team only saw the tapes once and then they disappeared .
Maybe they were based on approximations .
Topalov :
When they inspected the bathrooms they found a network cable hidden in the stucco ceiling .
That never came out .
Topalov :
We kept it quiet for many reasons .
Was it a mistake to keep it quiet ?
Topalov :
We could n't say anything .
It was a very tense situation .
If we announced it the match would have been cancelled and I wanted to play and to win the money .
What 's more , there were threats [ " Además , había amenazas " ] .
Made by whom ?
Topalov : Anonymous at the start , but they closed the airport .
It 's easy to talk here , but when you 're in Russia you think about how you 're going to get out .
Walking ?
And forget about the money of course .
So we shut up and continued the match .
Did you notice anything at the board ?
Topalov :
There you 're focused .
The problem for Illescas is that he did n't know what was going on either because Kramnik did n't say anything to anyone on his team .
So he got outside help ?
Topalov : Yes .
They were Russians , but not from the chess world .
So his team is innocent .
Topalov : I think so .
They are n't involved ; that 's why they doubt and deny everything .
Did he get help from the KGB ?
Topalov :
The trick is that no professional player was implicated , and those who told him the moves were fans or from the KGB .
If you gave Illescas that job they 'd crush me .
Have you spoken with Kramnik ?
Topalov :
The Kremlin will never admit they killed the Russian spy , which seems obvious , as Kramnik wo n't admit he cheated .
[ " El Kremlin nunca reconocerá que envenenó al espía ruso , lo que parece obvio , ni Kramnik que hizo trampas " ]
Did you feel in physical danger ?
Topalov : Yes , and I do n't think I 'll ever go back there .
Let 's move on to the rematch .
You yourself think it 's unlikely to be played .
Topalov :
The problem is that Kramnik wants to keep the title without defending it over the board .
He always wants some privilege .
I do n't even think he will play in Mexico .
In Kalmykia there was anti-doping control , yes ?
Topalov :
They gave us one test , but the laboratory was in Moscow .
What do you think of President Ilyumzhinov ?
Topalov :
He 's a businessman and he simply needed to have a Russian champion .
It 's nothing personal .
He got the order .
Do you believe that Kramnik continued cheating after the scandal was unleashed ? [ " ¿Cree que Kramnik siguió haciendo trampas después de destaparse el escándalo ? ]
Topalov : Personally I think yes , and that the new method was better .
[ Personalmente , creo que sí y que el nuevo método fue mejor . ]
Also in the tiebreak games ?
Topalov :
There they had a foolproof system .
In the fourth game , when he already had me beat , Kramnik made a move that would only occur to a computer .
He also had the right to a rest day , but even though he was sick he did n't take it .
If you 're going to have moves passed to you , best to play as soon as possible .
But they did it better than the shoddy job with the cables .
If that 's all true , what is going to happen in the future when computers are even stronger ?
Topalov :
If things continue this way , with the technology the Russians have , Kramnik will be invincible in a match .
There 's no way to stop it ?
Topalov :
Before the tiebreak , when a member of my team checked him ..
... for electronics ?
Topalov : Yes , with a scanner .
The guy was visibly shaking .
I think he had something on his body and he was worried it would be discovered .
I know that 's my personal opinion , which is just a guess .
The definitive proof for me is the cable .
But in the second game you wiped him off the board , although later you failed to finish him off .
Topalov :
It was precisely because he played like a computer .
He kept capturing pieces very quickly , with total calm , when my attack was very dangerous .
I could n't believe it .
If you look at the position with a computer it loves black , although it 's lost , until it 's too late .
How could he be so confident ?
Before the match did you suspect anything like this ?
Topalov :
We had it in mind and we thought , well , in the worst case we 'll get the money .
The problem was that we found out .
If you do n't discover it you just play chess .
But if you find out it wrecks you .
You can't sleep and you spin yourself in circles .
Introduction
Today , almost everybody in the developed world interacts with personal computers in some form or another .
We use them at home and at work , for entertainment , information , and as tools to leverage our knowledge and intelligence .
It is pretty much assumed whenever anyone sits down to use a personal computer that it will operate with a graphical user interface .
We expect to interact with it primarily using a mouse , launch programs by clicking on icons , and manipulate various windows on the screen using graphical controls .
But this was not always the case .
Why did computers come to adopt the GUI as their primary mode of interaction , and how did the GUI evolve to be the way it is today ?
In what follows , I?ll be presenting a brief introduction to the history of the GUI .
The topic , as you might expect , is broad , and very deep .
This article will touch on the high points , while giving an overview of GUI development .
Prehistory
Like many developments in the history of computing , some of the ideas for a GUI computer were thought of long before the technology was even available to build such a machine .
One of the first people to express these ideas was Vannevar Bush .
In the early 1930s he first wrote of a device he called the " Memex , " which he envisioned as looking like a desk with two touch screen graphical displays , a keyboard , and a scanner attached to it .
It would allow the user to access all human knowledge using connections very similar to how hyperlinks work .
At this point , the digital computer had not been invented , so there was no way for such a device to actually work , and Bush 's ideas were not widely read or discussed at that time .
However , starting in about 1937 several groups around the world started constructing digital computers .
World War II provided much of the motivation and funding to produce programmable calculating machines , for everything from calculating artillery firing tables to cracking the enemy 's secret codes .
The perfection and commercial production of vacuum tubes provided the fast switching mechanisms these computers needed to be useful .
In 1945 , Bush revisited his older ideas in an article entitled " As We May Think , " which was published in the Atlantic Monthly , and it was this essay that inspired a young Douglas Englebart to try and actually build such a machine .
The father of the GUI
Douglas Engelbart in 1968
Douglas Englebart completed his degree in electrical engineering in 1948 and settled down in a nice job at the NACA Institute ( the forerunner of NASA ) .
However , one day while driving to work he had an epiphany : he realized that his real calling as an engineer was not to work on small projects that might only benefit a few people .
Instead , he wanted to work on something that would benefit all of humanity .
He recalled Bush 's essay and started thinking about ways in which a machine could be built that would augment human intellect .
During the war he had worked as a radar operator , so he was able to envision a display system built around cathode ray tubes where the user could build models of information graphically and jump around dynamically to whatever interested them .
Finding someone to fund his wild ideas proved to be a long and difficult task .
He received his PhD in 1955 , and got a job at the Stanford Research Institute , where he received many patents for miniaturizing computer components .
By 1959 he had earned enough recognition to receive funding from the United States Air Force to work on his ideas .
In 1962 , Douglas published his ideas in a seminal essay entitled " Augmenting Human Intellect . "
In this paper , Douglas argued that digital computers could provide the quickest method to " increase the capability of a man to approach a complex problem situation , to gain comprehension to suit his particular needs , and to derive solutions to problems . "
He envisioned the computer not as a replacement for human intellect , but a tool for enhancing it .
One of the first hypothetical examples he described for this technology was of an architect designing a building using something similar to modern graphical CAD software .
This was a huge leap in thinking for 1962 .
The only computers that existed at the time were giant mainframes , and typically users would interact with them using what was called " batch processing . "
A user would submit a program on a series of punch cards , the computer would run the program at some scheduled time , and then the results would be picked up hours or even days later .
Even the idea of having users enter commands on a text - based terminal in real - time ( called " time - sharing " in the jargon of the day ) was considered radical back then .
Douglas and his growing staff worked for years to develop the ideas and technology that finally culminated in a public demonstration in front of over a thousand computer professionals in 1968 .

KFC asks for papal approval of new fish sandwich
KFC , the nation 's largest fast - food chicken chain , this week began selling something it 's never sold nationally : fish .
Its new Fish Snacker sandwich sells for 99 cents and is available at all 5,500 locations across the USA .
In an unusual move , President Gregg Dedrick sent a letter to Pope Benedict XVI , asking him to lend his personal seal of approval for the item " as a way for members of your flock to keep a holy Lenten season . "
ON DEADLINE : Cute ?
Offensive ?
Will you be eating a Fish Snacker this Friday ?
The Fish Snacker is a filet of 100 % Alaskan Pollack topped with tartar sauce and served on a sesame bun .
Vatican officials confirmed they received KFC 's request , and the company is hopeful to get the pope 's blessing this Lenten season .
" People can enjoy the flavor of the new Fish Snacker any day of the week , but we believe it will be especially popular on Fridays , " said James O'Reilly , chief marketing officer for KFC , a part of Yum Brands ( YUM ) .
AS A vote of confidence in Vietnam , the decision by Intel early in 2006 to spend $ 350 m building a new factory in the emerging South - East Asian economy was hard to beat .
And yet , before the year was out , the American chipmaker went further and raised its investment to $ 1 billion .
In eight months Intel had committed as much money to Vietnam as it had to China in the previous ten years .
In the Johor region of Malaysia , another global firm , Flextronics , has fired up the production lines of a new M$ 400 m ( $ 110 m ) factory to make computer printers for another American firm , Hewlett - Packard .
One of the largest contract electronics manufacturers , Flextronics already has vast facilities in China .
But it chose Malaysia as the site for its latest investment .
Further east , in Indonesia , Yue Yuen , a Hong Kong - based shoemaker , has been ramping up its output of trainers and casual footwear for brands like Nike and Adidas .
Production is increasing at the firm 's factories in China and Vietnam too , but output in Indonesia is growing the fastest .
Although all three companies had different reasons for their decisions , the outcome was the same : they chose to avoid China 's thundering economy in order to put their factories elsewhere in Asia .
These companies are not alone .
In the calculus of costs , risks , customers and logistics that goes into building global operations , an increasing number of firms are coming to the conclusion that China is not necessarily the best place to make things .
With its seemingly limitless supply of cheap labour and the rapid acquisition of technological prowess , China appears to be unstoppable .
Indeed , the perception is that every factory closing in America or Europe is destined to reopen in China .
Many have , helping China 's share of the world 's exported goods to triple to 7.3 % between 1993 and 2005 .
In comparison , every member of the G8 group of rich nations , with the exception of Russia , saw its share fall .
It is a similar story with manufacturing output .
Whereas China doubled its share of global production to almost 7 % in the decade to 2003 , most of the G8 saw their shares fall .
Interestingly , only the United States and Canada saw their shares rise — with just over a quarter between them .
Most things nowadays might seem to be made in China , but North America remains the true workshop of the world .
Yet it is not only China that is booming as a base for low - cost production .
Manufacturing and exports are growing rapidly in other parts of Asia ( see chart 1 ) .
Taken together , South Korea , Taiwan , India and the Association of South - East Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) increased their share of global manufacturing from less than 7 % to more than 9 % in the decade to 2003 .
Exports also rose across the board .
China is the emerging giant , but the investments that are being diverted away from the Middle Kingdom present the rest of Asia with a huge opportunity to become manufacturing hubs in their own right .
The question is whether they can seize it .
Too far , too expensive
Scott Brixen , an analyst at CLSA Asia - Pacific Markets , a Hong Kong - based investment bank , gives two big reasons why China has not found itself at the top of the list for some new factories : “ Rising costs and a natural desire by companies for diversification . ”
So far , most industrial development in China has taken place in the country 's eastern coastal regions , particularly around Shanghai and the Pearl River Delta near Hong Kong .
But costs in these centres are now rising sharply .
Office rents are soaring , industrial land is in short supply and utility costs are climbing .
Most significant of all are rocketing wages .
In spite of the mass migration of workers from China 's vast interior to the coast , pay for factory workers has been rising at double - digit rates for several years .
For managers , the situation is worse still .
“ China has become a victim of its own success , ” sighs Peter Tan , president and managing director of Flextronics in Asia .
He finds it especially hard to hire and retain technical staff , ranging from finance directors to managers versed in international production techniques such as “ six sigma ” and “ lean manufacturing ” .
There are not enough qualified workers to go around , causing rampant poaching and extremely fast wage inflation .
“ China is definitely not the cheapest place to produce any more , ” he says .
An analysis of labour rates across Asia by CLSA 's Mr Brixen supports that view .
Average wages for a factory worker , combined with social security costs , came to almost $ 350 a month in Shanghai in 2005 and almost $ 250 a month in Shenzhen .
By comparison , monthly wages were less than $ 200 in Manila , around $ 150 in Bangkok and just over $ 100 in Batam in Indonesia .
Although the productivity of Chinese workers is rising , in many industries it is not keeping pace with wages .
One solution is for companies to move inland where many costs are much lower than on China 's heavily developed coastline .
Indeed , the government has been promoting such a policy since 2000 , to spread the benefits of development to China 's poor interior .
Domestic Chinese companies have led the charge into the hinterland and a small , but growing , number of foreign firms have followed them .
Intel is one .
In 2004 it decided to invest $ 525 m in a new plant in Chengdu , the capital of Sichuan province , to complement its existing factories on the coast in Shanghai , 1,600 km ( 994 miles ) away .
Brian Krzanich , general manager of Intel 's test and assembly business , says the company 's decision was based on cost .
The government was keen to promote its “ go west ” policy , so it offered Intel generous incentives .
Needless to say , being so far inland raises transport costs for exporters .
But Mr Krzanich reckons there are compensations , because labour and utilities are much cheaper than on the coast .
But not everyone is convinced .
At Flextronics , Mr Tan's China factories are all located in eastern coastal provinces .
“ We have no interest in going west , ” he says , because it is too expensive to get products to America and Europe from there .
Other observers add that the shortage of management talent inland is even greater than on the coast .
And it is not easy persuading expatriate workers to take their families to places like Chongqing and Chengdu , where foreign companions and international schools are thin on the ground .
So many firms decide they would rather invest elsewhere in Asia .
Costs are only part of the equation .
Just as important is diversification .
Having already moved a big chunk of their production to China , many firms are reluctant to put any more of their eggs in the same basket .
A research report written last year by the Japan External Trade Organisation concluded : “ Due to the country 's increasing business risks and rising labour costs ... Japanese firms employing a ‘ China - plus - one ' strategy — in which they invest in China and another country , namely in ASEAN — should consider placing more emphasis on the ‘ plus one ' country . ”
Japanese companies may be particularly wary , but such nervousness is now shared by managers from other countries .
Some of their firms are concerned about growing unrest in China as swathes of the country 's rural population , particularly in the west , fall behind the thriving east .
Official figures record 87,000 incidences of rioting and social disturbance in 2005 , much of it following the forced appropriation of farmers ' land in the name of development .
The actual number of cases of civil unrest could be far larger .
Equally important are concerns about growing protectionism .
The United States and the European Union are becoming more assertive in holding China to account over its World Trade Organisation obligations .
Companies worry that this could lead to sudden interruptions to trade .
Ask Yue Yuen , the world 's largest contract shoe manufacturer .
The company produces more than 180 m shoes a year from factories in China , Vietnam and Indonesia , most of them bound for America and Europe .
So when the European Union imposed anti-dumping duties in October 2006 on leather shoes imported from China and Vietnam , the firm was quick to raise its production in Indonesia .
“ Trade relations with other nations and the tariff and quota situation are vital considerations for where we invest , ” says Terry Ip , a spokesman for the company .
So too are wage rates .
With each shoe passing through up to 200 pairs of hands on the production line , Yue Yuen 's operations are highly labour - intensive .
In China the firm is experiencing rapid wage inflation .
Although this is partly offset by productivity improvements which mean that overall unit labour costs are rising by 8 % a year .
Pay for factory workers is rising in Vietnam and Indonesia too , notes Mr Ip , but labour costs there are as much as 35 % lower than in coastal China .
Another company with a China - plus - one strategy is Uniqlo , a Japanese clothing retailer .
Last year it decided to reduce the share of clothes it sources in China from 90 % to 60 % as a hedging strategy against future trade disputes .
New factories in Cambodia and Vietnam will make up the shortfall .
Intel , with facilities in Vietnam , the Philippines , Malaysia and China , is creating a diversified portfolio also .
Keeping secrets
China also has other risks , notably a lack of protection for intellectual property rights .
Stories abound of foreign investors finding local companies churning out identical goods to their own , but under a different brand .
For that reason a number of companies in industries such as medical devices have instead set up shop in Singapore .
Often these products are capital - intensive , so labour costs are less important than strong intellectual property laws .
Several chemical companies have even built facilities in Singapore with the intention of shipping most of their products to China .
Feedstock is more easily available in Singapore , but just as important is confidence that valuable industrial processes will not be stolen .
Managers also worry about the rising value of the Chinese currency .
Although nobody expects sudden leaps , the yuan does appear to be on a steadily upward trajectory , having risen by a further 4 % against the dollar since the government first revalued the currency by 2.1 % in July 2005 .
Pundits expect it will continue to rise by around 5 % in the year ahead , which will do little to bolster China 's attractiveness for export - based manufacturing .
Of course , cost and risk are not the only considerations in choosing where to put a factory .
The quality of a country 's infrastructure , the presence of suppliers and the size of the local market all count .
For such reasons , China will remain an attractive place to invest .
Kumar Bhattacharyya , a professor of manufacturing at Britain 's University of Warwick , believes the lure of China 's burgeoning domestic market will outweigh the various concerns over cost .
“ Why do people go to India and China ?
The standard answer is for cheap labour , but most big technology companies go there for the market , ” he says .
Naturally , industries such as textiles and clothing will always seek places with cheap labour , hopping from country to country as wages rise and equalise .
However , for more complex and capital - intensive manufacturing , it is clear that foreign direct - investment flows are aimed at accessing local markets rather than low costs .
In emerging Asia markets simply do not come any bigger than China , with its 1.3 billion people .
Individual wealth is still extremely low compared with figures for the United States and Europe , but a vibrant middle class is emerging in the big cities .
With growth rates of more than 10 % a year , China offers huge potential .
Transport and other infrastructure in China is also in better shape than many other Asian countries and the quality and availability of suppliers is improving all the time , enabling highly integrated supply chains to develop within the country .
Yet other parts of Asia also offer sizeable markets .
India has 1.1 billion people , an emerging middle class of its own and will grow at around 8 % this year , although the country is a good deal poorer than China .
To date , foreign investment in manufacturing has been limited — total investment inflows in 2005 amounted to a meagre $ 7 billion , compared with more than $ 70 billion for China ( see chart 2 ) .
Hugely inadequate infrastructure is one of the chief obstacles in India , as is a business climate famous for its bureaucracy .
Yet even there , more foreign companies are starting to open factories .
Manufacturing graduates
The car - parts industry is a good example , with both Toyota and Hyundai investing recently to take advantage of the almost 700,000 engineering and science graduates that India produces every year .
It has even been suggested that Indian technicians could re-engineer some of the West 's highly automated car - production lines to make them more labour - intensive for the Indian market .
Firms making specialty chemicals are keen to combine technical expertise with low costs and a growing market .
Even low - technology industries are interested :
Yue Yuen is close to building its first shoe factory in India , attracted not only by the country 's vast pool of cheap workers but also by efforts to set up special economic zones that offer tax breaks .
Most observers reckon India 's manufacturing evolution is ten years behind China's , but progress is unlikely to be as swift or as smooth .
A country that puts a higher value than China does on democracy and the rights of the individual will inevitably find it harder to push through infrastructure projects and reform to sensitive areas such as the rigid labour market .
With 560 m people , the ASEAN trade bloc also offers a big population .
South - East Asia has been the chief beneficiary of companies ' decisions to diversify out of China .
The problem is that the ten ASEAN nations have yet to form a single market .
Although the region offers plenty of opportunity for export - based manufacturing , as a single market it remains highly fragmented .
Companies want to be able to set up one factory to serve the whole region , but numerous barriers prevent them from doing so .
Governments in the region have announced bold plans to create the ASEAN Economic Community by 2015 , with a free flow of goods , services and investment .
Following a free - trade agreement in 1992 , tariffs on the majority of goods traded in the region have fallen below 5 % .
Much harder to achieve will be the removal of non-tariff barriers , which would call for harmonising thousands of industry standards and customs regulations , and setting up independent bodies to govern regional trade and mediate in disputes .
Few believe that the ASEAN Economic Community will come about as its architects hope .
Less developed nations , such as Myanmar and Laos , will integrate at a slower pace than countries like Singapore and Malaysia — if they integrate at all .
Nonetheless , progress is being made and the rapid rise of China and India has added urgency to the process .
Twelve areas , including electronics , health care , textiles and logistics , have been singled out as the first to be worked on .

Trainers to peddle harder
In the meantime , governments must also think how to get their industries into higher - value manufacturing .
Although ASEAN received record levels of foreign direct investment in 2005 , at $ 37 billion , much of the manufacturing coming into the region is basic , labour - intensive assembly work that adds only a little value .
“ I get worried about ASEAN , ” says Roland Villinger , a Bangkok - based partner at McKinsey , a consulting firm .
He thinks the region urgently needs to add to the sophistication of its manufacturing — partly because India and China are improving so fast .
He agrees that a lot of factories in ASEAN are part of a “ China - plus - one or plus - two ” strategy .
However , he believes South - East Asia needs to be more than just a hedge against risk in China .
And ASEAN has its own share of risks .
Thailand 's new military government seems to be doing its utmost to deter investment , including tighter curbs on foreign ownership and botched currency controls .
Smart but tiny
Bright spots do stand out .
Singapore has a highly educated workforce , although its population is only about 4 m .
The country has a solid history of attracting sophisticated manufacturing that calls for strong technical skills and often involves extensive research and development .
Malaysia too has had some success in moving into higher - value manufacturing .
In May last year , for example , Intel opened a new research centre in Kulim employing 900 people to design microprocessors , chipsets and motherboards for use in its products worldwide .
And in Thailand efforts to make the country the “ Detroit of the East ” are starting to pay dividends — at least they were until the present troubles .
Thailand was set to overtake the United States last year as the world 's largest maker of one - tonne pick - up trucks .
Toyota recently set up a new research - and - development centre in Thailand for its light truck business .
Elsewhere in the region , though , governments talk a good game , but have yet to make enough progress .
For the moment , as foreign investors choke on their China investments and look elsewhere , that does not matter too much .
But as India sorts out its problems and as China grows into an ever bigger market , South - East Asia needs to integrate its own markets or see its newly found popularity among manufacturers slowly fade .
Just when we were beginning to think the media had finally learned to tell a hawk from a handsaw when covering global warming ( at least when the wind blows southerly ) , along comes this article ‘ In Ancient Fossils , Seeds of a New Debate on Warming ’ by the New York Times ’ William Broad .
This article is far from the standard of excellence in reporting we have come to expect from the Times .
We sincerely hope it ’s an aberration , and not indicative of the best Mr. Broad has to offer .
Broad ’s article deals with the implications of research on climate change over the broad sweep of the Phanerozoic — the past half billion years of Earth history during which fossil animals and plants are found .
The past two million years ( the Pleistocene and Holocene ) are a subdivision of the Phanerozoic , but the focus of the article is on the earlier part of the era .
Evidently , what prompts this article is the amount of attention being given to paleoclimate data in the forthcoming AR4 report of the IPCC .
The article manages to give the impression that the implications of deep - time paleoclimate have n’t previously been taken into account in thinking about the mechanisms of climate change , whereas in fact this has been a central preoccupation of the field for decades .
It ’s not even true that this is the first time the IPCC report has made use of paleoclimate data ; references to past climates can be found many places in the Third Assessment Report .
What is new is that paleoclimate finally gets a chapter of its own ( but one that , understandably , concentrates more on the well - documented Pleistocene than on deep time ) .
The worst fault of the article , though , is that it leaves the reader with the impression that there is something in the deep time Phanerozoic climate record that fundamentally challenges the physics linking planetary temperature to CO 2 .
This is utterly false , and deeply misleading .
The Phanerozoic does pose puzzles , and there ’s something going on there we plainly do n’t understand .
However , the shortcomings of understanding are not of a nature as to seriously challenge the CO 2 .- climate connection as it plays out at present and in the next few centuries .
The use of the more recent Pleistocene and Holocene record to directly test climate sensitivity presents severe enough difficulties ( discussed , for example , here ) , but the difficulties of using deep - time Phanerozoic reconstructions for this purpose make the Pleistocene look like childs ’ play .
The chief difficulty is that our knowledge of what the CO 2 .
levels actually were in the distant past is exceedingly poor .
This situation contrasts with the past million years or so , during which we have accurate CO 2 .
reconstructions from ancient air trapped in the Antarctic ice .
Obviously , if you do n’t know much about how CO 2 .
is changing , you are poorly placed to infer its influence on climate , even if you know the climate perfectly and nothing else is going on besides variation of CO 2 ..
But , neither of these latter two conditions are true either .
Our knowledge of climates of the distant past is sketchy at best .
Even for the comparatively well - characterized climates of the past 60 million years , there have been substantial recent revisions to the estimates of both tropical ( Pearson et al. , Nature 2001 ) and polar ( Sluijs et al , Nature 2006 ) climates .
Most importantly , one must recognize that while CO 2 .
and other greenhouse gases are a major determinant of climate , they are far from the only determinant , and the farther back in time one goes , the more one must contend with confounding influences which muddy the picture of causality .
For example , over time scales of hundreds of millions of years , continental drift radically affects climate by altering the amount of polar land on which ice sheets can form , and by altering the configuration of ocean basins and the corresponding ocean circulation patterns .
This affects the deep - time climate and can obscure the CO 2 - climate connection ( see Donnadieu , Pierrehumbert , Jacob and Fluteau , EPSL 2006 ) , but continental drift plays no role whatsoever in determining climate changes over the next few centuries .
Let ’s take a closer look at the question of CO 2 variations over deep time .
In contrast to the situation for the late Pleistocene , there is no one method for reconstructing CO 2 at earlier times which is fully satisfactory .
Methods range from looking at carbon isotopes in microfossils to looking at the density of pores on fossil leaves , with many other exotic geochemical tracers ( e.g Boron ) coming in in recent times .
There is also some data for the very early Earth associated with the CO 2 conditions under which certain exotic minerals ( uraninites and siderites ) form .
None of the methods is unambiguous , and none provide information about other greenhouse gases that might be playing a role ( though there may be some hope to do something abou methane ) .
As an example of the difficulty faced by the field , take a look at the compilation of various estimates of CO 2 since the Permian presented in the following figure ( From Donnadieu et al , G3 , in press ; the red squares come from an attempted geochemical model fit to the data .
The data set comes from Royer et al. ( 2004 ) and is available here ) .
By the time one gets back to the Permian , the error bars are huge .
At earlier times , the estimates are even more problematic .
Broad ’s article does make reference to a very interesting paper by MIT ’s Dan Rothman , writing in PNAS .
This paper attempts a peek at the CO 2 over the past 500 million years , using a clever and novel reconstruction technique .
It is innovative , but far from the last word on the subject .
Broad inappropriately cherry - picks Rothman ’s statement that there appears to be no clear connection between warm climates and CO 2 ( except in " recent " times , about which more anon ) .
However , Broad ’s article neglects all the caveats in the paper , which clearly point to the real problem being that the reconstructions of CO 2 and climate over such time scales are so uncertain that it ’s not clear that the data is up to the task of teasing out ssuch a connection .
Even in Rothman ’s reconstruction , during the past 50 milllion years — when the data is best and continents are most like the present — the long term cooling trend leading into the Pleistocene is clearly associated with a long term CO 2 decline .
This is not our main reason to infer that increasing CO 2 will warm the climate in the future , but insofar as the data supports CO 2 decline as a main culprit in the long slide from the Cretaceous hothouse climates of 60 million years ago to the cold Pleistocene climate , it also lends weight to the notion that as industrial activity busily restores CO 2 to levels approaching those of the Cretaceous , climate is likely to turn the climate clock back 60 million years as well .
From Broad ’s flip dismissal of the CO 2 - climate connection in the " recent " part of the record , the reader would never guess at the length and particular significance of this period .
And then , too , the tired old beast of Galactic Cosmic Rays ( GCR ) raises its hoary head in Broad ’s article .
The GCR issue has been extensively discussed elsewhere on RealClimate ( e.g. here and here )
On one level the GCR idea is another instance of the problem that Phanerozoic climate variations may have had many causes , giving rise to a false appearance of decorrelation between climate and CO 2 .
Whatever role GCR may have played in deep time climate , the climate of the past century and its attribution to CO 2 is a wholly different kettle of fish , since in modern times we have direct observations of GCR and they are not doing anything of a sort that would cause the observed warming — to say nothing of the fact that one would still have to argue away the basic radiative physics which makes CO 2 affect the planet ’s radiation budget .
We repeat :
There has been no recent trend in cosmic rays that could conceivably account for the recent warming , even if the GCR proponents were right about the physical mechanism underpinning their theory .
This is made abundantly clear in this recently published article .
Further , whatever was going on in the past , the present observations do not support the supposed cloud - GCR connection that is supposed to mediate the climate effect .
That ’s not the end of the story , for there are also severe methodological difficulties in the way the GCR proponents have attributed Phanerozoic change to GCR rather than CO 2 , and also severe conceptual difficulties in the supposed physical link between clouds and GCR ..
Some of these difficulties may ultimately be resolved and allow a more fair test of the possibility that GCR influences played some role in the past .
Surely , the play given to Veizer and Shaviv in the context of Broad ’s article is an instance of false balance of the worst sort .
The possibility that the GCR theory may play some role in deep - time Phanerozoic climate is eminently worthy of further consideration , but the way its major proponents have used the theory in attempts to undermine forecasts of near - term warming is unjustified .
Besides the broad - brush errors discussed above , Mr. Broad commits a number of lesser climatological faux pas , in areas where he really ought to know better .
He refers to CO 2 as " blocking sunlight " ( whereas it ’s actually thermal infrared which CO 2 affects ) .
He says that CO 2 traps heat " in theory . "
This is a lot like saying that a bowling ball dropped from an airplane will fall to the ground " in theory . "
There is indeed a theory involved in both cases , but the use of the phrase gives a completely wrong picture of the certainty of the phenomenon .
There is no more doubt about the heat - trapping effect of CO 2 than there is about the physics that causes a bowling ball to fall .
Broad also says that the greenhouse effect of CO 2 " plateaus " at high levels .
This is a botched attempt to describe the well - known logarithmic radiative forcing of CO 2 , incorporated in every climate model since the time of Arrhenius .
There is no " plateau " where CO 2 stops being important .
Every time you double CO 2 , you get another 4
Watts per square meter of radiative forcing , so that the anticipated climate change between present CO 2 and doubled CO 2 is comparable to that between doubled CO 2 and quadrupled CO 2 .
In fact , as one goes to very high CO 2 levels ( comparable to the Early Earth ) , the radiative forcing starts to become more , rather than less , sensitive to each further doubling ( something that can be inferred from the radiative forcing fits in Caldeira and Kasting ’s 1992 paper in Nature ) .
Let ’s not lose sight , however , of the essential conundrum posed by Phanerozoic climate , particularly by the warm climates of the Cretaceous and Eocene .
Current climate models do not reproduce the weak pole to equator gradients believed to characterize these climates , and have trouble warming up the polar climates enough to melt ice and eliminate continental winter without frying the tropics more than data seems to permit .
Maybe there ’s something wrong with the data , or maybe there are currently unknown amplification mechanisms that make the switch from a moderate Holocene type climate to a hothouse more catastrophically sensitive to CO 2 .
This truly must give us pause as we contemplate the experiment of doubling CO 2 in the next century .
It ’s certainly an experiment that would help to resolve some of the mysteries of Phanerozoic climate , but we ’d on the whole prefer to see the mysteries resolved by improved studies of past climate instead .

Add graphics to your blog , book , or presentation
People pay attention to graphics .
They respond to graphics .
They learn from graphics .
If you want your readers / learners / audience to " get " something as quickly and clearly as possible , use visuals .
And you do n't have to be a graphic artist , designer , or information architect to put pictures in your presentation , post , or book .
This post is my first attempt to categorize the kinds of graphics I do here , and offer tips for creating visuals that tell the story better and faster than words .
Type : Charts / Graphs
Use for : Showing relationships between two or more things , quantitative data , things that happen over time .
Good for simplifying complex relationships and getting people to think about something in a new way .
Type : Comparisons
Use for : Good vs. bad , old vs. new , before vs. after , technical vs. manager , boxers vs. briefs , etc .
Particularly good for things that are -- or should be -- changing , and for showing a goal / end - state .
Type : Reminders / Kick in the rear
Use for : Bringing the " duh " things into focus .
Especially good for things that everyone knows but does n't always do .
Good for distilling what 's important , and providing motivation and / or inspiration .
Type : Metaphors / analogies
Use for : Making a point by relating it to a completely different domain or idea .
" Programming is like being a composer ... "
Good for building understanding and increasing retention and recall .
Type : Gratuitous
Use for : Making a point , entertaining , waking up the reader 's brain ( getting the brain 's attention ) , to add emotional impact , or just because you want to ; )
Can also be inspirational .
Type : Photographs
Use for : Real examples ( why describe the car when you can just show it ) , entertaining , waking up the reader 's brain , to add emotional impact and inspiration , and to personalize by showing people .
Type : Diagrams
Use for : Demonstrating complex processes , ideas , relationships , etc. , showing things you can't photograph ( mock - ups , etc. ) .
Especially good for learning .
How To
You need two skills for adding graphics to your stuff : idea generation and making the graphic .
1 ) Coming up with the idea
Figuring out what the graphic should be is the most important part .
The good news is , you do n't need to be an artist or designer to do it .
The bad news is , it may not be easy at first for those who are n't used to thinking visually .
Back to the good news , all it takes is practice .
Here are some tips :
* Ask yourself , " What 's the point I want to make ? "
This is the single most important step , and if you have trouble coming up with a graphic , it may be because you do n't really know exactly what you 're trying to say ( or why you 're saying it ) .
* Distill the point to it 's simplest , once - sentence form .
" Micromanaging employees creates zombies " " You ca n't make revolutionary leaps if you make only incremental improvements " " If nobody hates your product , it might be mediocre "
* Narrow down the graphic types that apply to this point .
Is it important to show quantitative data ?
Is it important to get people to look at something from a new angle ?
Is it something that changes over time ?
Is it something new and unfamiliar that can be related to something familiar ?
Is it something that represents a dramatic change from the " old " way ?
Is it a product that you can get a photo of ?
Is it something where motivation is crucial ?
* Pretend that for some reason you cannot use words to make your point .
Just keep thinking and brainstorming on , " How would I say this without words ? "
Once you come up with something , then you can add words to enhance it or make the context clear ( like adding the words , " Before " and " After " , etc . )
Trust me on this one -- all it takes is a little practice to get good at this , but many tech people especially ( those who think in code and command - lines ) hit a brick wall the first several times they do this exercise .
It 's the one we put all our Head First authors through , and everyone gets better fairly quickly .
At first , though , expect to have an " I suck " experience .
( Practice tip : next time someone asks you to explain something , sketch your answer on a napkin or whiteboard . )
2 ) Creating the graphic
You need image editing software and a drawing tablet .
* Get a Wacom tablet .!
I would be helpless without my 4x6 Intuous , but the $ 99 Graphire is plenty for most people .
( I do lust after Wacom 's gazillion dollar Cintiq , but have n't managed to justify getting one . )
* I use Photoshop for 90 % of my graphics
... but you can use Adobe 's less - expensive Photoshop Elements to create new graphics and edit / resize photographs or graphics created in some other app .
I 'm not suggesting other high - end graphic tools like Adobe Illustrator , because I figure that if you 're an illustrator , you already have it , and if you 're not an illustrator , it 's probably way more than you need .
* I use only the smallest portion of Photoshop 's capabilities
nothing exotic or difficult .
Mostly I use the Layer Styles palette to make drop shadows , and then the freehand paintbrush to draw the annotation arrows .
The most important part of the process is preparing the graphics for the web , and Photoshop makes this quite easy using the " Save for Web " ' dialog box .
You want the file sizes as small as possible -- I try for under 10 k , but some of my graphics may be as big as 20 k if they 're quite complicated with lots of different colors and subtle shading .
* Charts and Graphs
Most of my graphs come entirely from Photoshop , but for pie-charts or more precise bar charts I use a different app to create the chart , then copy or import it into Photoshop to add annotations or play with the colors , etc. Obviously Excel would work for this , but I use Apple 's Keynote which has basic charting capability .
Graphs and charts are the one area I really want to develop , and so I 'm currently reading :
-- Tufte 's books including his latest , Beautiful Evidence
-- Steven Few 's books ( a little more accessible than Tufte ) including Information Dashboard Design : The Effective Visual Communication of Data
-- I'm just starting to explore DeltaGraph software , so if you suddenly see over - the - top charts and graphs on the blog , you 'll know that the novelty has n't worn off .
* Stock photography
Stock photos used to be expensive , but thanks to web apps like iStockPhoto , you can get just about anything you can imagine for a couple dollars ( if the photos are just for the web , you can get away with the lowest resolution / least expensive version of the photo ) .
People always ask about the 50's photos I use here and in the books -- they 're in a stock photography collection we own called Retro Americana from the Getty Images Photodisc collection .
The Retro Americana collection is now " retired " ( stock photo agencies often take collections out of circulation for a few years to prevent them from being overexposed ) , but it'll probably be available again in the future .
Of course there are about a zillion other stock photo collections , not counting all the one - at - a - time pictures from places like iStockPhoto .
Another source we use ( especially for the books ) are Hemera 's inexpensive PhotoObjects collections , which give you objects on a clear white background .
( Like the , um , black lingerie I used in my " I 'm not a woman blogger " post )
* Fonts
I use handwriting fonts for my hand - drawn annotations , and the best source for fonts is probably the inexplicably named fonts.com site .
* Find your own style !
Do n't copy ours unless it feels like you .
50's people with cartoon thought bubbles , festive fonts , and hand - drawn annotations are what we do because it's what we like to do .
( And , oh yes , because it 's about the only thing we know how to do given our lack of design / art / illustration skills ) .
* More Resources
An earlier post of mine
RapidViz
Drawing on the right side of the brain
I 'm sure many of you have other tips to add including other software apps , books , and ideas .
My favorite tip is to go nowhere without a small notebook and something to draw with .
When I have time to kill , I 'm always sketching out ideas for graphics for the books or here on the blog .
Have fun !

Thank you , so helpful - I love this blog .
I record a lot of movies ( Camtasia ) for my customers , so I am always looking to reuse / releverage elements .
Two resources I depend on : smartdraw ( http://www.smartdraw.com/) is so easy - to - use out of the box ( new version 2007 , sets a standard for interfacte ease of use ) and has tons of ready - to - use icons / charts .
For a price , the new Powerframeworks service ( http://www.powerframeworks.net) has prefab flow - charts that save time because they are less about icons and more about communicating concepts and finding graphic metaphors .

If you 're really interested in learning about ( statistical ) graphics , I would highly recommend the Grammar of Graphics by Lee Wilkinson .
It 's a big book , but covers pretty much all the bases ( data , perceptual theory , aesthetics etc ) as well as providing a theoretical framework for describing graphics .
It 's unlikely to help you in the day - to - day construction of graphics , but will ( hopefully ) profoundly change how you think about graphics , and inspire you to create new types of graphics .
( However , the book does n't discuss interactive graphics in depth see GGobi and Mondrian for examples of what they can do )
Posted by : Hadley | Nov 10 , 2006 7:05:39 PM
There 's something broken in the presentation of the types of graphics .
The doubled headings ( in graphics , then text ) add more confusion to me than clarity ; especially the non-doubling of the Venn Diagram one .
It 's just weird .
Posted by : sapphirecat | Nov 10 , 2006 7:13:40 PM
I make it a point to have at least 1 graphic with each post ... the exceptions being when I am posting a video .
Aside from differentiating your blog and assisting to ' tell the story ' , images really help on RSS feeds as well .
Since feedreaders supply a generic view of a post , images really accent the post and bring attention to it .
Thanks for the great post .
Fantastic advice !

I can wholehertedly recommend Tufte 's books , particularly his earlier ones .

And you could hardly do better for pure graphical inspiration than Wurman 's amazing website " Understanding USA " at http://www.understandingusa.com/

Regarding stock photos I 've found flickr very useful .
There is an immense amount of quality images out there with a Creative Commons licence .
Check out

Remember that CC does n't mean " no licence " : be sure to mention the original creator of the photo and only do stuff granted by the CC licence .
flickr has a very nice CC search feature ( including the different CC licences )

I agree that Wacom tablets are great .
I use mine for everything -- even when doing word processing .
In fact , over time , I 've developed a weird typing style that uses only the middle finger and thumb of my right hand so I can hold the stylus at all times !
I also agree that Adobe Photoshop is the software of choice ; even if it is wildly overpriced .
However , as Kathy mentioned , the cheaper Adobe Elements may be all you need for simple tasks .
I use a long list of 2D and 3D graphics software , but if I could only pick one I would use Photoshop .
Here are a couple quick design tips :
1 ) Make sure your graphics have adequate " contrast . "
Kathy 's venn diagram ( with the blue and red circles that feature black text ) is a good example of what NOT to do .
Sorry , Kathy ! ;>)
Light colored ( or white ) text on those dark colors would have been much more readable ( especially on older CRT monitors ) .
2 ) Avoid overly bright colors .
Bright colors ( like R:0 , G:255 , B:0 ) scream AMATEUR !
Instead , choose a color ( like R:0 , G:200 , B:0 ) that is less saturated and easier on the eyes .
( White , of course , is the exception . )

Awesome , this is the sort of stuff I need to learn .
I 'm a SAS programmer , and am ( in my own not so humble opinion ) very good at working with data , but not so hot on presenting it .
How about some info about free tools and resources ?
My current favourites are
Paint .
Net ( http://www.getpaint.net/) as a stand - in for Photoshop , it 's pretty well kitted out , and is regularly updated , definitely more than adequate for touching up graphs etc .
I recently found yEd from yWorks ( http://www.yworks.com) to be very good for flowcharts etc , though limited in its number of available shapes , it does allow you to use images for the nodes , which is pretty snazzy .
I also like the fact that you can chuck all your nodes and joining arrows any which way , then get the software to re-arrange them afterwards .
Anyone got any other suggestions ?
Posted by : ChrisW75 | Nov 12 , 2006 8:57:28 PM

I have no intention of reigniting an age - old flame war , but I will point out one additional option for image editing .
The GIMP ( Gnu Image Manipulation Program ) has been able to do everything I 've ever needed to do with an image .
I am not a Photoshop user , so I wo n't call it a Photoshop replacement , and I understand that Photoshop users do n't care much for GIMP ( Photoshop users are seriously PASSIONATE ) .
GIMP does layers , tons of transforms , and has tools for tricks like drop shadows and antique effects , and much more than I know what to do with .
GPL Licensed , so its included with most Linux distros , and a Win32 and Mac versions are available for download from http://www.gimp.org/

Liked your blog about graphics .
Felt it was a shame to not be able to really see your graphics though .
It would have been nice to zoom in and take a look at the examples you were talking about rather than just regard them as part of a taxonomy .

Great post and great timing !
I had actually been debating on whether I should contact you for basically this exact information ( creating the nice images and such that you use here ) .
My only additional question is if you 've used an Windows based software that produces sleek looking graphs .
I 've used a few various ones but have n't really liked any of them .
Posted by : Nathan | Nov 13 , 2006 6:02:54 PM
Kathy , thanks for reminders of all the different types of graphics .
Excellent .
I want to put in a plug for OpenOffice.org Draw .
It runs on Windows , Linux , Mac , OS / 2 ( yes , it does ;> ) , etc. and is a very easy but powerful vector drawing program .
It also has some raster editing features like changing to grayscale , changing RGB , contrast and brightness , etc .
Plus you can export to PNG , JPG , GIF ( with transparency ) , EPS , etc .
I use it for everything , with just a little final polishing in Photoshop as needed .

My husband has loved this blog for quite a while and now that I finally get around to checking out your information I understand why .
Good information in a succinct , well - organized format .

Great post !
I often pull out a napkin and draw pictures when talking with people face to face but I never think of " drawing pictures " on my blog .
Thanks for the great advice .

I 'd second that GIMP plug - the latest version kicks ass , and once you figure out how to draw curves ( BTW there are some great books on it - GIMP , like Photoshop , is too big to just grope around with in the hope that you 'll work it out , but unlike Photoshop there are n't enough good tutorial sites ) it really rocks .
There 's a version that runs natively in Mac OSX without the need for X windows too .
The only thing I 'm not sure of is the Wacom support - I suspect it may not work with a Wacom , but if you use paths to draw with you do n't need a Wacom .

I personally would put another stage in this .
Before you consider putting a graphic in , whether you 're struggling to explain yourself or not , look at the language you 're using .
If it 's not in plain english then no graphic , no matter how nifty , is going to help illustrate your point !

The single most important takeaway ?
What point are you trying to make ?
Know it , own it , make it .
Finish .

Great article - I love your illustrations .
Another tool I 'd recommend to people who can't afford to shell out on Illustrator / Photoshop is Xara .

Via Ongoing , I read some interesting discussions of programming languages — mainly Python vs. Ruby , with most people happily dumping on Java .
Steve Yegge , in particular , argues that language success is based mainly on marketing , and that Python is doomed to obscurity because of the community ’s lack of marketing savvy .
The programming language cycle
While I agree that Python probably is doomed to perpetual obscurity at this point , I think that Yegge ’s focus on marketing is oversimplistic ; instead , I ’d argue that there ’s a self - perpetuating cycle at work for successful programming languages :
Elite ( guru ) developers notice too many riff - raff using their current programming language , and start looking for something that will distinguish them better from their mediocre colleagues .
Elite developers take their shopping list of current annoyances and look for a new , little - known language that apparently has fewer of them .
Elite developers start to drive the development of the new language , contributing code , writing libraries , etc. , then evangelize the new language .
Sub-elite ( senior ) developers follow the elite developers to the new language , creating a market for books , training , etc. , and also accelerating the development and testing of the language .
Sub-elite developers , who have huge influence ( elite developers tend to work in isolation on research projects rather than on production development teams ) , begin pushing for the new language in the workplace .
The huge mass of regular developers realize that they have to start buying books and taking courses to learn a new language .
Elite developers notice too many riff - raff using their current programming language , and start looking for something that will distinguish them better from their mediocre colleagues .
You ’ll notice that there ’s no step here called “ marketing ” ; instead , there are several distinct stages of evangelization and community building .
Major vendors ( other than the language ’s owner , if it ’s a vendor ) will start to notice the language once the second wave ( sub- elite ) developers arrive , and IT managers will notice it because of books , magazine articles , and pressure from the high - end developers .
Some — possibly a lot — of marketing will come out of those steps , but it is as much a result of the language ’s success as a cause .
Points of failure
In this cycle , there are a few highly probably points of failure :
Timing : A new language might not be at the right stage of development ( too raw , or too stale ) at the time when elite developers decide to make a mass migration .
A new language might not be at the right stage of development ( too raw , or too stale ) at the time when elite developers decide to make a mass migration .
Features :
If the new language ’s features do n’t answer the elite developers ’ annoyance list , not enough of them will migrate to it .
If the new language ’s features do n’t answer the elite developers ’ annoyance list , not enough of them will migrate to it .
Openness : Elite developers are used to having a lot of influence , and if the new language ’s development process does not allow them sufficient say in the new language ’s evolution , they will leave before they attract enough sub-elite developers .
Elite developers are used to having a lot of influence , and if the new language ’s development process does not allow them sufficient say in the new language ’s evolution , they will leave before they attract enough sub-elite developers .
Tools : Sub-elite developers might find the language unsuitable for day - to - day production use , especially if enough basic tools are not available ( libraries , testing , debugging , GUI tools , performance measurement , etc. ) .
Sub -elite developers might find the language unsuitable for day - to - day production use , especially if enough basic tools are not available ( libraries , testing , debugging , GUI tools , performance measurement , etc. ) .
General acceptance : Regular developers might object to the new language and sabotage projects using it , either by producing poor - quality code or by missing deadlines ( and blaming the new language in both cases ) .
Most programming languages stumble over one or more of these — it ’s as much luck as clever design when a language like C++ or Java makes it past the hurdles and into the workplace .
Success tends to draw more success , money draws more money , etc .
The final and most important point here is that a programming language ’s perceived coolness will always suffer from its success .
Java cannot possibly still be cool when there are thousands of regular developers slaving away in the bowels of ACME Widgets using it to write enterprise applications .
If , in fact , Ruby displaces Java in the enterprise ( which may not happen , since Ruby has no advantage over Java to match Java ’s memory - management advantage over C++ ) , it will suffer precisely the same fate , and we can expect Bruce Tate to write a book Beyond Ruby in five years or so .
By that measure , Python ’s very failure is a kind of success — as long as it never really becomes takes hold in the workplace it will always carry a small degree of distinction with it , and at least a few elite developers wo n’t feel pressured to move on .
Like a movie or band that never becomes too popular , Python will hang onto its snob appeal .

Psychologists test long - held theory of emotional cushioning .
That failing feeling : students who expect to do poorly tend to be more miserable than those who expect great things , even when both flunk .
© Punchstock
Expecting the worst may not make you feel any better when faced with a disappointment , say psychology researchers who have tested the age - old advice .
Most people believe that mentally preparing for the worst outcome in an examination or race will soften the disappointment if we flunk or flop - and heighten the joy if we succeed .
But the idea has rarely been put on scientific trial .
Margaret Marshall of Seattle Pacific University and Jonathon Brown of the University of Washington , Seattle , did just that .
They first asked more than 80 college students to fill in questionnaires that measured their general emotional outlook on life - whether bright or gloomy .
The students then practised a set of moderately difficult word - association puzzles on a computer .
Based on this , they rated how well they expected to perform on a second set of such problems .
The team then gave half the students problems that were slightly easier than the first set , while half were given more difficult puzzles .
This ensured that the students ' performances would either exceed , or fall short of , their expectations .
Afterwards , the subjects filled in a questionnaire to measure their emotional reaction , such as how disappointed or ashamed they felt .
Students who expected to do badly , the researchers found , actually felt worse when they messed up than those who predicted they would do well but similarly botched their test .
This suggests that gloomy expectations could actually exacerbate the wretchedness felt when a person fails .
The old advice " does n't work " , agrees psychology researcher Thomas Gilovich of Cornell University in Ithaca , New York , whose interests include optimism and pessimism .
" You 're just making yourself miserable . "
Sunny side up
The study , published in Cognition and Emotion1 , suggests that a person 's reaction to disappointment or failure is determined mainly by their general outlook on life .
Those who expect to succeed tend to have a sunnier stance all round , the researchers say .
If they fall short of their goals , they are likely to look on the bright side and still think they have done reasonably well .
These people , who see the world through rose - tinted spectacles , also tend to deny responsibility for their poor performance .
Marshall and Brown showed this in a second part of the study , in which students were also asked whether they felt their test performance was a reflection of their ability .
The ' rose - tinted ' group who did badly in the test tended to believe that it was not .
Conversely , people who have low expectations tend to have a glum take on life and may be less mentally equipped to deal with disappointment .
If they do n't make the grade , they take it to heart and tend to blame themselves .
It may be difficult for a person to cushion the blow of failure by trying to brighten their natural temperament , Brown says .
Based on his earlier research , he says that the best way a person can deal with a setback is by writing it off as unimportant .
" People need to be strong enough to learn that failure is not bad , " he says .
The dark side
ADVERTISEMENT
At least in some cases , negative thinking could still work to a person 's advantage .
Anticipating failure at a forthcoming mathematics test or public talk , for example , is thought to help some anxious people motivate themselves to study harder and avert their dismal prophesy .
Psychologists call such individuals ' defensive pessimists ' .
Conversely , there could also be detrimental consequences to perpetually expecting the best , says Julie Norem of Wellesley College , Massachusetts , who studies the psychological strategies people use to pursue goals .
Those who continually brush off their failures at the office might be overlooking the larger picture - such as the fact that they are about to be fired .
Sadly , this means there is no simple advice about whether we ought to expect the worst .
This study " is part of a very large puzzle " , Norem says .

Last week , I invited the readers of shmula to pose questions to Mary Poppendieck , the author of Lean Software Development : An Agile Toolkit for Software Development Managers ( Paperback ) , which won the Software Development Productivity Award in 2004 and , the sequel Implementing Lean Software Development : From Concept to Cash ( Paperback ) which will be available in early September 2006 .
For this interview , 12 Questions were submitted and Mary was gracious enough to answer them — the reader ’s Questions and Mary ’s responses are below .

What are some of the agile development success stories Mary has seen in government or higher education ?
I have n’t done a lot of work with governmental organizations and none with higher education .
But I did have one great experience with a defense contractor .
The group had a very interesting project going , but every month they had to report to the general in charge how they were doing on something like 63 process measurements .
They found this frustrating and so did the general so they wanted to know how to improve their measurements .
I asked what does the general really want you to accomplish in the end ?
Find that out , and then figure out how to constantly test your current capability to do it .
Show your progress to the general at the beginning of every report , and you ’ll get his attention .
Some months later I learned that the team had established a single , high - level performance measure , and then they focused like a laser on making sure that the software improves that measure every month .
The general follows the team ’s progress with great interest , the team is completely engaged , and the program is considered an outstanding success .
2. Mishkin Berteig said , August 21 , 2006 @ 2:25 pm
Mary , based on your experience with lean environments and your experience with agile environments , what do you think is the most important improvement or change to be made to the Scrum methodology to make it more lean ?
Scrum should not be considered a static methodology , it should follow its own advice ( inspect and adapt ) and evolve over time .
One way to make sure this happens is to keep up with what Scrum ’s inventor , Jeff Sutherland , is doing with it today .
It is important that Scrum teams focus on the whole product , not just developing software .
At Jeff ’s company , this is accomplished by defining the end of a sprint as successful live deployment at multiple customers ’ production sites .
The whole development team is engaged not in making the product owner happy , but in getting all targeted customer sites to go live on time .
This means sending out release candidates early and happily accepting and adapting to the surprises they uncover .
It makes the customers ’ users and support people as much a part of the team as the developers .
According to Jeff , ScrumMasters must be true leaders who help teams self - organize to meet commitments .
The team must focus on and adapt to customer needs dynamically , as part of every sprint .
Architecture must support incremental development .
Disciplined development and deployment practices must be in place .
Product managers must have an accurate , up - to - date assessment of what is possible , and may commit only to what can be done within the team ’s proven capacity .
Finally , senior management and company culture must be fully engaged in supporting this way of working .

What is your favorite experience about agile and lean development to interest people ?
Agile development is a good description of how I developed process control software in the early 1980’s .
I worked as a junior member of a very experienced and competent engineering team that built new plants and put in processes to make roll - based products such as adhesive tape , magnetic tape , graphics products , anything you could make by spreading some sort of soup on a film .
This organization ’s job was to build new plants and design and install new equipment every job was completely different than anything that had ever been done before .
Computer controls were just coming in at the time , and I was the new kid who knew how to program minicomputers .
I learned how to do disciplined , adaptive development as I watched these experts design a new plant and its new equipment and get it in shape to make a completely new product .
Although there was no talk about process , the organization could repeatedly and reliably design and install a top - notch new manufacturing line in about a year .
4. TheBizofKnowledge said , August 21 , 2006 @ 3:09 pm
In your opinion , what is the best way for a company to switch from plan - driven projects to an Agile / Lean approach ?
Is agile / lean the best environment for all projects , or are there some that might work better if handled in a more traditional way ?
I do n’t like the term plan - driven ’ when it is used as an antonym for Agile , because Agile is as plan - driven ’ as any other approach ; I would use the term forecast - driven ’ instead .
Agile is feedback - driven , while non-agile approaches tend to be driven by forecasts of the future .
In domains where these forecasts are likely to be accurate , you can assume that the forecast is fact and devise a plan based on that assumption .
Just remember when variances occur that they are as likely to be caused by faulty assumptions as faulty execution .
When a forecast is a mere guess , it is far better to use an approach which adapts to the future as it unfolds .
In manufacturing feed - back - driven ( pull ) approaches produce better results than forecast - driven ( push ) approaches in almost all cases .
I would speculate that the same is true of development , although I do n’t believe that any single approach can fit all situations .
To return to your first question , the first step in moving from forecast - driven projects to feedback - driven agile / lean methods is to change the measurements .
The book Rebirth of American Industry  by William Waddell and Norman Bodek makes a good case that the measurements imposed by traditional cost - accounting methods are the biggest impediment to the successful implementation of lean manufacturing .
Similarly , I believe that the measurements imposed by traditional project management methods are the biggest impediment to the successful implementation of lean development .
In particular , instead of measuring variation from plan , we need to start measuring the delivery of realized business value .
If a company wants to move from a forecast - driven development to a feedback - driven development , it needs to shorten the cycle time from customer request to software delivery , or from concept to cash .
The shorter your delivery cycle time , the more responsive you can be to feedback .
Queuing theory says that short delivery cycle times depend on having very short queues of work - in - process , so a good approach for switching to agile is to take a hard look at how much partially done work you have in your system .
Start by looking for churn ( rework ) : if you have test - and - fix churn , you are testing too late .
If you have requirements churn , you are specifying requirements too soon .
Next look at the defect list : test - driven development finds and fixes defects before they need to go on a list .
Finally , look queues of work between departments : a cross-functional team can develop an increment of value from idea to deployment without using an inter- departmental list or queue .

Which are the differences between your two books on Lean Software Development ?
Our first book , Lean Software Development , is aimed at people who do not understand why Agile development is a good approach .
It provides the underlying justification for rapid , incremental development .
The second book , Implementing Lean Software Development , makes the assumption that the reader has bought - into agile development , and wants to figure out what to do next .
The second book is filled with things we have learned over the last few years : including answers to questions we have often heard and ( anonymous ) stories of enlightening situations that we have encountered .
It delves more deeply into areas we have found to be increasingly important , including : 1 . A Focus on the Whole Product 2 . Test - driven Development 3 . Respect for People
6. Horst Franzke said , August 22 , 2006 @ 4:10 am I see teams entering the Lean software arena through a specific set of practices ( e.g. XP ) , which often help them attack their most obvious problems .
BUT at the same time I see many teams miss the underlying Principles , which would help them to really grow and improve in the long run .
What would be your approach to help such a team with lean practices to adopt the underlying principles ?
Thanks !
The first thing I would do is ask these questions : 1 . Is the team focused on delivering increments of real value to end customers and does everyone understand what that really means ?
2 . Is the team a Whole Team composed of everyone necessary to deliver value to the ultimate customer ?
3 . Does the team reliably and repeatedly delivers on its promises ?
When you can answer yes ’ to these three questions , I ’ll bet you wo n’t feel the team is missing underlying principles .
If your answer is no ’ , then the first order of business is to change it to yes ’ .
But how do you do that ?
I observe that when teams miss the mark in the areas I just mentioned , there is often a leadership vacuum .
Take a look at the team and see if it has both technical and marketing leadership .
I believe that teams need a leader who understands and cares deeply about the customers and their problems .
They also need a leader who understands and cares deeply about the technical integrity of the product .
This leadership may reside in one or two people , or in small teams it may be distributed among several people .
But teams which lack market and technical leadership tend to produce mediocre results .
7. Steve Hebert said , August 22 , 2006 @ 2:37 pm
In addition to the lean tools that programmers use , how do you influence lean processes outside the group ( minimizing unchecked code downstream in QA and helping upstream specs arrive at the last responsible moment ) ?
Also , what tools do you see that exist to help manage this type of process ( i.e. seeing how many turns features take between development and QA , allowing all team members to triage their own lists , handle gating of large functions ( release an item to QA when all needed components have been completed ) .
Thank you
Your question seems to indicate that separate organizations exist to create specs and check code .
I would recommend that these responsibilities should not reside in separate departments , but specialists in these areas should be members of a Whole Team everyone necessary to deliver value to the ultimate customer .
An increment of customer value should go from specification to delivery in a very short time without spending time in interdepartmental queues .
I would not measure turns of features between development and QA there should not be any such thing .
In lean manufacturing , the job of QA is to mistake - proof processes so that it is impossible to produce defective material .
In lean software development , the job of QA is to create a test - driven environment that makes defects virtually impossible .
Thus QA precedes development , it does not follow it .
The idea is to go from feature request to production deployment in a very short cycle time .
Jeff Sutherland ’s company , PatientKeeper , has three cycle times :
They deliver any maintenance fix they choose to implement in a week .
They deliver any new feature they choose to implement in a month .
They deliver any new application they choose to implement in three months .
By deliver ’ I mean they go live into production at customer sites customers who are using their software to store medical records .
Each year for the last three years , the company has gone live with about 45 releases a year , never missing a deadline .
PatientKeeper uses one tool to accomplish this fete it is a tool that lists in detail what remains to be done for every pending release , and how long that work is expected to take .
The development team is never loaded beyond its capacity to deliver , and the management team at the highest level of the company adjusts release expectations every week to be sure that teams can meet their deadlines .
8. Vivian said , August 24 , 2006 @ 3:11 am I am planning to launch Lean Concepts and Tools for process improvements .
I would like to first introduce Lean thinking and Concepts and some time down the line introduce basic tools .
My company is a part of the Outsourcing Industry .
Could you show me a roadmap that ’ll make the launch successful ?
There is no roadmap that will guarantee lean success , but we do have a roadmap at the end of our new book that might help get you started in the right direction :
1 . Begin where you are :
How do you create value and make a profit ?
2 . Find your biggest constraint :
What is the biggest problem limiting your ability to create value and make a profit ?
3 . Envision your biggest threat :
What is the biggest threat to your ability to continue creating value and making a profit over the long term ?
4 . Evaluate your culture : Establish and reinforce a culture of deep respect for front line workers .
Remove barriers that get in the way of pride in workmanship .
5 . Train : Train team leads , supervisors and managers how to lead , how to teach , and how to help workers use a disciplined approach to improving work processes .
6 . Solve the Biggest Problem : Turn the biggest constraint over to work teams .
Expect many quick experiments that will eventually uncover a path to a solution .
7 . Remove Accommodations :
Uncover the rules that made it possible to live with the constraint .
Decide what the new rules should be .
8 . Measure :
See if end - to - end cycle time , true profitability and real customer satisfaction have improved .
9 . Implement : Adopt changes supported by results .
10 . Repeat the Cycle : With the biggest problem addressed , something else will become your biggest problem .
Find it and repeat the cycle .
9. Jon VanSweden said , August 24 , 2006 @ 5:34 am Mary , I am looking to benchmark a company that has applied Hiejunka principles within the office .
Have you applied this lean tool in your organization ?
An office organization is very different than a development organization , and I focus on lean in development , so I would not be able to recommend a company for you to benchmark .
Heijunka in an operating environment means producing at takt time .
In a development organization , heijunka means establishing a cadence that keeps development moving forward at an even pace .
In software development , the cadence is established through regular , short iterations and regular , closely spaced releases .
Just as in bicycling , a steady , relatively fast cadence optimized for your situation is the best way to sustain high performance over the long term .
10 . psabilla said , August 25 , 2006 @ 4:58 am I ’d love to see examples ( and / or ) suggestions of how to implement the following to software organizations : 1 ) Kanban , 2 ) 5S , 3 ) Visual Workplace , 4 ) The Big Room ( Product Management , Development , QA , etc¦ ) ” how to best plan and coordinate between all stakeholders , 5 ) SMED , 6 ) 5 Why ’s , 7 ) TPM .
This is an Epic - sized question , I know , but I think sharing your knowledge will help all of us tremendously .
Thanks so much !
An epic - sized question indeed !
I ’ll do just a brief comment on each one , and then refer you to my most recent book , Implementing Lean Software Development : From Concept to Cash , for more on some of them .
1 . Kanban .
The Kanban of Software development is the index card .
Stories are written on cards , estimated and selected at the iteration planning meeting , posted in the team room , updated when the story is being worked on and when it is done .
2 . 5S’s .
Apply the 5s ’s to the server which stores the code and associated documentation , to desktop environments used by more than one person , and to the code base .
We have examples in our new book .
3 . Visual Workspace .
There are three aspects to a visual workspace the Kanban card ( index card ) which tells people what needs ot be done , the Andon , or signal that something is wrong ( eg. lighting up a red light when the build breaks ) , and big visible charts which tell everyone how things are going .
We also have a section on this in our book .
4 . The Big Room , or Obeya .
Take a look at the video 21st Century Jet ( KTCS , Seattle ) and you will see good examples of the Big Room in action during the development of the Boeing 777 in the 1990’s .
This is n’t a new idea , but it certainly is a good one .
5 . SMED , or Single Minute Set-up .
The time it takes to test and deploy a release is the set - up time of software development .
Many companies take so long to test software that releases are very far apart , and every effort is made to stuff as much as possible into each big - batch release .
Some companies release to production several times a day ( anti-virus software comes to mind ) they have SMED figured out .
6 . 5 Why ’s .
Root Cause Analysis for any problem is a fundamental skill that all teams need to learn .
First we have to implement a Stop - the - Line mentality with test - driven development and continuous integration , so that we find and fix most defects instead of putting them on a rework list .
Only then can we start using the 5
Why ’s to discover the root cause of the remaining problems that occur .
7 . TPM or Total Preventative Maintenance .
In software development , we call this refactoring .
We keep on improving the design of the code base to keep it healthy and prevent it from calcifying and becoming a jungle that can no longer be maintained .
Legacy code is code that has not had regular TPM .
11 . Mike Griffiths said , August 25 , 2006 @ 2:25 pm
When comparing lean manufacturing techniques to software engineering .
Some authors map Toyota ’s Set Based Concurrent Engineering to practices such as supplying multiple available time - slots options for a meeting , yet the manufacturing process is really based on parallel development and then survival of the fittest solution .
This would be akin to having several developers or teams of developers creating the same components and then selecting the best version .
Have you seen SW companies follow a parallel development approach and aggressive pruning of less suitable solutions ?
Also , what guidelines ( circumstances , batch sizes , etc ) would you give for concurrent engineering in SW project ?
The most important time to evaluate multiple solutions is when an irreversible decision that is critical to the success of the system must be made .
For example :
Which language should we use ?
Which middleware will we standardize on ?
Which database will we go with ?
How do we structure the architecture to support the response time we need ?
How will we organize the main flow of the user interface ?
And so on .
It is a good strategy to make these tough and critical decisions as late as possible , and I have seen companies develop multiple solutions in all of these areas when the decision was critical to success .
Note that developing options does not mean setting up separate teams to compete ; usually it entails creating objects that are a bit more general , and maintaining multiple build - time options .
For example , it is fairly easy for a code base to support multiple databases , user interaction strategies , and even middleware , with the selection made at build time .
There certainly are critical choices that can’t wait until build time : language , security strategy and the core architectural strategy come to mind .
When these types of choices are critical to the success of the system , it can be a good idea to thoroughly explore several approaches by actually developing and testing critical capabilities using each alternative .
However , for most parts of the code and in most ( but not all ) domains , the best way to maintain options is to minimize the number of irreversible decisions that are necessary .
Early releases of software should not preclude future changes .
Instead early releases should be as simple as possible and protected with tests , so that the code is easy to change later .
The use of change - tolerant coding techniques is the quite often the best way to maintain options in software development this allows exploration of the design space sequentially , as the problem emerges .
I find that embedded software and games are domains that are particularly amenable to set - based design , that is , the exploration of multiple solutions during development .
This is because these types of software generally do not change once they are released , so the decisions made during development are , basically , irreversible .
12 . Deborah Hartmann said , August 27 , 2006 @ 8:34 am I ’ve heard vaguely , several times , of something that ’s beyond Agile and referred to as Lean , though I do n’t really know if it is .
Called a flow process , it seems to describe a short - cycle - time software production line , in which there is no backlog , or maybe just a short one .
I was referred to your book but did n’t find it .
I must admit , it sounds like lazy Agile to me – just do whatever comes in , do n’t bother setting expectations .
Any idea what I ’m talking about here , where it comes from ?
Is this a photocopied too many times  version of some valid approach ?
Rumours they may be , but I have to say that the latest casting gossip for Star Trek XI is looking superb .
Imagine these names lined up to play Kirk , Spock , McCoy and Sulu .
Stop for a moment , have a look , and realise just how good these guys look for the roles .
Now the warning goes out once again that these should be read with a handful of salt , as usual the story comes from a site and an unnamed source , so they just might not be true at all , and yet when I look at them I think they could well do it .
Matt Damon , as we heard , is confirmed by this source as being in talks for James T. Kirk , and well ahead in the negotiations .
Adrien Brody is in talks to play Spock .
Now when you look at him you can start to see it .
Gary Sinise is said to be in talks for the role of McCoy or Bones , another excellent choice where you can see some likeness .
Finally the source talking to IGN says that Daniel Dae Kim is possibility for the role of Sulu , although these negotiations are far from being started .
Then there 's the rumour of James McAvoy for Scotty which we heard a little while ago .
I actually think this line up could really work , they do carry a certain similarity to the original characters , and they are all good actors in their own right .
Still , would some of these want to be associated with such a huge franchise ?
Damon , Sinese and Kim are used to franchise / series but Brody is n't .
What do you think of the cast list then ?
Sounding good ?
I think I really would like this lot to go through , although on that list Damon is the weakest choice for me .
Nobody is commenting on the rumours at the moment .
What do you think of that possible line up for the new Star Trek ?
Memo : Communist Imposition
To : Josef Stalin , Mao Zedong
From : Karl Marx
Dear esteemed General Secretary Stalin and PRC Chairman Mao ,
I have lately been surfing the net and have heard alarming rumors to
the effect that certain regimes have been imposing their Communist
processes on the proletariat .
I assure you gentlemen that this
behavior is one hundred percent at odds with the core principles of my
Communist Manifesto .
To be sure , introducing Communism does sometimes requires a bit of
counterintuitive bloodshed in overthrowing the bourgeoisie .
However ,
after the revolution , self - determination should be the rule : citizens
should stop and reflect at regular intervals on how to become more
effective , and adjust their behavior accordingly .
These rumors of
enforced adoption of personality cults , violent suppression of
non -Agi , er , I mean non-Communist Party ideas , and the blatant
exploitation of the working class — these are all distortions of
the ideas I set forth in my Manifesto .
Well I say : tsk , tsk .
All an educated man can hope for is that
continued patient education will eventually help people understand
what Communism is really about .
And I prefer to explain rather than
to kill dissenters .
Yours always ,

Author 's Note , written ( shortly ) after this entry — I 'll spare you the suspense : today 's post is crap !
It 's partly just a " hello , I 'm still alive " ping , and partly an effort to close out some of the topics I opened recently , so I can move on to new things .
And it does poorly at both .
But I 've been insanely busy at work for the past 2 months , and I wanted to get one more post in before the end of the year , so there 's been no good time for it .
We just recovered from a 3 - day power outage in Kirkland after a nasty windstorm , so before diving back into work , I figured I 'd throw these thoughts out , jumbled as they are .
There 's nothing new here , though .
After reading the first couple of comments , I 've decided that my next few blogs will almost certainly be about Emacs hacking , since I 've done a ton of that on the side lately .
It 's fun to talk about , and yields lots of prettily - colored code .
So after the first of the year , look for some Emacs stuff from me .
Rumor has it that I 've been eaten by Godzilla .
There 's a fat - joke in there somewhere , my gut tells me .
Ahem .
There 's also apparently a rumor that I was abducted by the Agile Mafia , as if they were somehow competent enough to get past their standing morning meetings and do something about me .
And there 's evidently speculation that Google got mad at me for exposing how cool they were , and they locked me in a room filled with doughnuts and are forcing me to eat them all .
That last one is - almost - true , except the part about the lock on the door .
They know all they need is the doughnuts .
Anyway , I figure I 'd better write something before Godzilla really does eat me .
Lord knows all this Google food is turning me into a target even Gojira - sama might notice .
I do n't know what I 'll end up writing about today , but let 's start with my blog anniversary , shall we ?
Almost exactly a year ago ( give or take a couple days ) , my buddy and fellow Googler Sean O'Connor was walking over to invite me to play foosball on our crappy old table , as we often did , when he mentioned in passing : " hey man , I read your blog " .
" Sorry , which blog is that ? "
I had n't blogged anything to my internal Google blog in a while , but I assumed that 's what he meant .
" The one about Emacs " .
That was just weird .
I had n't written anything about Emacs since back at the 'zon .
What was weirder was that he was the third person that week to mention a blog entry of mine , which had never happened in my six - month tenure at Google , and each person had mentioned a different old Amazon entry .
A little investigation turned up that there was this spiffy new - ish user - posted news site called Reddit , a PG - startup site no less , and a bunch of my old Amazon internal blogs had been showing up there that week .
Which was odd , because I had put them online fully six months earlier and then forgotten all about them .
Why were they popping up now , all at once ?
For lack of a better term , I 'll call this phenomenon Essay Molasses .
If you know what it 's really called , please enlighten me .
I wrote about it in my You Should Write Blogs essay back at Amazon , describing an essay my good friend Jacob Gabrielson had written ( still Amazon proprietary info , alas , though it would n't hurt them to publish it now . )
Almost nobody read it initially , to my considerable dismay , but after six or eight months its key ideas had mysteriously spread to virtually everyone with decision - making power in the company .
Essay Molasses is a time - delay on a meme that would otherwise spread rapidly , but because the idea is encoded in an essay from a relatively unknown author , most people are n't going to read it until it seems everyone else has read it .
Like anything else , the growth rate is effectively exponential , so by the time you hear about it , it seems to have appeared overnight .
But its initial readership is measured in days ( or weeks ) per person , rather than persons per day .
By the time you hear about it , it may have been around for quite some time .
Based on my two data points — Jacob 's essay and my Amazon blogs —
I could conjecture that the time delay is about six to eight months .
But I 'm sure it's a function of context , and content .
How long was it before Hardy noticed Ramanujan , or Einstein paid attention to Bose ?
( Not that anything I or Jacob have written is nearly so original nor valuable , of course , but I figured I 'd pick some examples of Essay Molasses that you 've actually heard about . )
Although I do n't have anything resembling conclusive evidence , I think Essay Molasses is closely tied to the survival of the idea .
It 's a gestation period , and if you take away the essay that wraps the idea , the embryo wo n't survive .
People accuse me of being long - winded , but it 's not often that breaking short wind , amusing as it can be , has any real long - term effect .
I could use a good marketing name for this longer - is - better phenomenon too .
The synopsis is that I think taking the time to write about something thoroughly gives it a greater ( if slower ) impact .
Look at Gladwell 's " The Tipping Point , " or Surowiecki's " The Wisdom of Crowds . "
Either of their theses could have been succinctly expressed in a simple essay or paper , but would they have had the same global impact ?
I think not .
With respect to blogging and essays , researching your idea a bit is helpful , sure , but even just thinking about it carefully can often provide that nourishing yolk that gets your idea past the chicken - and - egg adoption phase and into the mainstream , where people can whine about how much they dislike you on Reddit .
Ah , sweet , sweet success .
And taking too long to research it can effectively kill it .
I 've been blocked many times by the desire to turn an idea into a more formal thesis , when all I really needed to effect change was to get the idea out there .
People are smart , and they 'll figure out the remaining details ( and omissions or errors on your part ) quickly enough once you 've got your basic idea across .
So call it laziness , call it long - windedness , call it sloppy pseudo - journalism , but I 'm writing the way I do because I suspect it yields the best ratio of effort to impact .
Feel free to be your own judge !
So , after that six - month pregnant pause last year , my Amazon blogs burst out last December like a sudden , fierce , smelly wind , blowing everyone 's hair back and causing mere candles to flame like war - torches .
And I 've emitted occasional new outbursts ever since .
The problem is that once you 've said one or two things that are tolerably credible , everything else you write gets immediate attention , with no molasses anywhere in sight , and if you say something stupid it will be all over the place in no time .
So it can be a little scary writing anything at all .
It 's no wonder people are so slow to publish research papers ; they have to cover their arses tenfold , and hem and haw with the approriate disclamatory rituals to minimize the risk of being found wrong on some point , to their supposed perpetual embarrassment .
Of course Ramanujan was wrong about a lot of his theorems , and it does n't mar his genius in the slightest .
But most people would rather be right about something trivial , or simply not be heard at all , than be wrong occasionally in the quest to get their ideas out to others .
OK , I 've said way too much on Essay Molasses .
Presumably the lessons here are : ( 1 ) say what 's on your mind , and do n't worry overly much about being right or wrong or you 'll delay the flow of ideas ; ( 2 ) do n't expect anyone to read your work until sufficient Essay Molasses has flowed slowly under the bridge , and ( 3 ) take some time to tell the whole tale .
Even if people do n't care for the destination , they might possibly enjoy the journey .
I 've been thinking of writing some sort of Grand Finale to what would then become my Agile Trilogy , but none of my ruminations have really jelled into any , ah ... any jelly worth ... er , ruminating .
* Cough *
So rather than trying to make them pretty , I 'll just dump my ideas on you in the buff .
They 're flitting around in my head like , oh , a bit like healing fairies from any Zelda game , if you really must know where I 'd rather be right now , and I 'm going to snatch them in mid-flight and put them in little jars for you to gawk at .
You can really tell when the wine gets ahead of the writing .
I 'm telling you .
First , I was going to write an earnest little memo from Karl Marx , written to Josef Stalin and Mao Tse Tung , along these lines : Would n't that have been cute ?
Nah , you 're right .
Stupid .
Plus , I kinda have a soft spot for Fowler on account of hisbook ( you know , the one none of you IntelliJ users actually read ) , so I 'd have reservations about poking fun at him in public , even if he 'd said something really dumb .
Next , I was thinking of responding individually to each of the 10 trillion comments I got on my last 2 blog entries , like so : Commenter : Entertaining rant , but you just do n't get it !
Agile works for me , so it Must Be True .
Me : I take it all back !
Give me your money !
Oh , God , what have I done ?
Is it too late for me to get away with becoming a Feng Shui consultant ?
I had no idea how much money you can make by exploiting the credulous .
Seriously .
Had I only known ... ohhhh , the pain ...
But given that I 've pretty effectively excluded Agile Consulting from my agenda , how far afield must I reach before my balls are safe ?
Commenter : Great post !
It 's the best !!
If you 've got a moment , please drop by http://www.i-beat-captcha.com and find out all about my spam thingy .
Made it myself !!
Me : Mmmmmm .... Spaaaaammmmmm ....
But I 'm too lazy to respond to all of them personally .
So , you know , just send all your disposable income to an Agile Consultant near you .
Any one of them will do just fine .
They all say the same thing : " You do n't quiiiiiite get it yet .
Cha-ching !
" NEXT , I was going to reflect on how I do n't like ceremonies .
Yeah .
Seems unrelated , I know .
But Agile , being a church and all , is big into ceremony and ritual .
You'd think ceremony would kinda get in the way of actually getting real work done , but they 'll tell you otherwise .
So they get this aging bald guy to cut a big ribbon in front of the new mall ... damn , I 'm sorry .
My bad , I 've got the wrong ritual .
They get an aging agile consultant to steep your team in all the latest stand - up rituals , including the all - important Passing the Hat ritual .
I 'm not big into ceremony .
I 've known this for many , many years , since I was a wee youngun on my way to First Communion , and my intense dislike was deeply reinforced during my long tour in the heavily ceremony - laden U.S. Navy .
I do n't like dressing up .
I do n't even particularly care for the Two Big Ones : weddings and funerals .
I can deeply appreciate receptions and wakes , since they 're much less rehearsed , and peoples ' true feelings tend to display .
But ceremonies , where we all dress up and hold hands and mouth the expected mouthings , they 're just not for me .
Maybe they 're for you .
If so , we differ , and I can respect that .
Most people like their ceremonies ; they think they 're one of the things that separates from animals .
Not true , of course ; I 've seen hippos and crocodiles performing the most amazing and heart - rending death - rituals on Discovery Channel .
But ceremonies make people feel like , you know , life 's all important and meaningful , and that big green mall - ribbon somehow imparts depth to an otherwise shallow and trivial historical event .
Not for me .
And I see a clear connection between Agile , with its stand - up meetings and its status reports and its hokey project management artifacts , and the desperate need for ceremony .
To me , ceremony is necessarily phony .
Real ceremonies are unrehearsed , impromptu gatherings in which the participants stand momentarily in awe of the amazing events in which they are ( almost always unexpectedly ) partaking .
Such occurrences happen once and only once per event .
Spare me the Mall Grand Opening Guy.
FINALLY , in my third big Agile Installment , I was planning to demonstrate to all interested parties that Agile is simply about recycling tired ideas , nothing more .
The Agile folks are entirely concerned with being able to predictably replicate shit that other people have already delivered : it 's just the Church of Me-Too .
This last point seems pretty obvious , if you stop to think at all about it for a moment .
Do we have Agile Modern Art , in which teams gather to predict how many days it will take to produce the next modern masterpiece ?
Do we have Agile Great American Novelists getting together in little self - help meetings to talk about how Operations Research can help them write the next Da Vinci Code ?
( You can just smell the jealousy on them , too .
How did such a crap novel make it so big ?
A hundred thousand prospective Agile Authors have been asking themselves that since it farted itself into the public consciousness .
Oh you can bet your sweet b-hind that I 'm jealous .
At least I admit it ! )
The answer to all these rhetorical questions , is , of course : " eight ? "
( If you 're a Simpsons fan , anyway .
" Do I know what a rhetorical question is ? " -- Homer , in quite possibly the Best Line Ever . )
You can't predict the delivery or quality of great art , unless maybe you consider Thomas Kinkade to be Great Art .
You can't predict the next Mark Twain or the next Douglas Hofstadter , and no amount of stand - up - meetingism is going to produce one for you .
Index cards surely will not .
But prediction is what half the Agile folks claim to stand for .
Ah , prediction .
How we look to our psychics , our soothsayers , our bookies .
Now , yesterday , tomorrow , forever .
We all yearn for prediction .
But when you fall for that crap , you 've fallen , like a star from the sky .
I predict that I wo n't last another glass of wine at this rate , so perhaps I should begin meandering towards a wrap - up .
It seems pretty clear to me , on reflection , that Agile is really all about being able to predict and manage the delivery of stuff that others have delivered .
The same old tired websites , the same old inventory - management systems , the same old database - driven doohickeys that the consultants in question have seen a hundred times before .
That 's fine and dandy .
Wonderful , in fact .
As long as someone else does it .
You ?
Fine .
Go for it .
But I 'm going to close this blog with a little belief of mine , one that you 're most welcome and encouraged to disagree with , although it wo n't dissuade me in the least .
Let 's get to it , shall we ?
In his Mythical Man-Month essay , Fred Brooks Jr. argues that our attitude towards software project management derives from our folklore , in which people cried out for a silver bullet to slay werewolves .
But so far there 's been no silver bullet : no single , magical , overnight 10 x productivity gain .
So when you meet a werewolf : some project or task you 're saddled with that threatens your livelihood , what can you do ?
Lacking a silver bullet , all you have is your own two hands .
You grab your silver keyboard and start bashing away .
That is to say , you roll up your sleeves and you If your boss is a jerk , fire your boss .
That much , I hope , is obvious .
When I first wrote about software development at Google , most people wrote me and said " you pegged it . "
But a few people mailed me privately and said : " which Google do you work for ?
Because it 's not like that for me at all ! "
The answer is : Google is what you make of it , for yourself .
If your boss is a vampire , fire him or her !
Google can't ( and should n't ) police every last nook and cranny of its own development organization .
You need to make sure your group is Googley .
And you know exactly what that means , so if it 's not that way now , fix it !
And if you 're not at Google , which many of you brilliant engineers out there are not , you still know what Googley means !
It 's the opposite of " sucky " .
If your organization or team or little cubicle cul - de-sac is un-Googley , then fix it !
Googliness need n't be constrained to Google , however prevalent it might be there today .
But how ?
I mean , do you have that kind of power ?
You 're just a peon like me , right ?
How can you fire your boss ?
Or for that matter , if your boss totally rocks in an unrecognized way , how do you promote your boss ?
The answer is that you need to be confident .
Agile consultants are on the lookout for weakness .
If they espy it in you , they 'll pounce !
And you may not be strong enough to withstand their Agiley claims .
I would n't have been , fifteen or twenty years ago .
But there 's an out for you — for all of us : if you 're a superstar , then your management chain needs you .
They want the best for you , and if for some reason they do n't , or they just do n't understand how valuable you are , then they 're doomed .
Which means " screwed , " in modern terminology .
So how do you make yourself a superstar ?
Never stop learning .
I 've heard people say they think this position is a crock , that it 's ludicrous , that you could n't possibly spend your whole career learning new things .
But I think differently .
I think every program you write should be the hardest you 've ever written .
And that 's what I blog about , mostly .
Improving yourself .
Because most employers , the ones who matter in the long run , they 'll be able to see how great you 've become , and they 'll alter the very course of their business plan , if necessary , to make the best use of you .
Does that sound incredible ?
Well , I 've seen it play out both ways over my modest 20 years in our industry , and that 's how I see it .
And that 's my little belief .
You 're welcome to regard it or disregard it as you see fit .
But I call my own shots .
And even now , after I 've found an employer who surrounds me with almost terrifyingly brilliant people , people far greater than I am in virtually any technical dimension you care to name , I can still tell , and tell them , when they 've gone astray , and they listen .
( Fortunately they rarely stray , and I 'm still learning a ton from them every day .
The benefit of working for Google , at this point , is still mostly mine . )
My next few blogs , I think , will be about how to make yourself an engineer who 's above the Agile Treadmill , who can call your own shots , do your own startup , whatever you see fit .
But I have n't been blogging for a reason .
Well , actually a few .
One is that I still feel a pressing need to earn my keep at Google , and I 've been working like a demon possessed on a new framework of my own devising that I think will more than adequately pay my way for the past year here .
Another is that I have an obligation to get my computer game , Wyvern , back online : an obligation to some 50,000 players ( out of 250,000 who 've tried the game ) that I durs n't easily turn my back on .
Plus I have some pretty cool stuff in store there , for you Wyverneers who may be listening .
Once I get this Google project reasonably secured , that is .
And I do take my own advice : I read voraciously , and I spend as much time bettering myself as I can possibly muster .
It 's paid off so far , so I see no reason it should n't continue to do so .
But these past four hours are all I can afford towards blogging this quarter , so it 'll have to do !
Hopefully I 've quelled any concerns ( or hopes ) that I 've been eaten by Godzilla .
And I 'll see you all in the New Year , blogging afresh about fresh new topics , God willing .
Happy holidays , and Happy New Year !p.s .
We have 2 Tornado foosball tables in the Google Kirkland Office now .
Amazing what just one short year can witness ...

In the last few days , there have not only been a deluge of articles about impeachment on Reddit ( a popular online news redistribution site ) , but they ’ve been overwhelmingly voted to the main page of the site .
This resulted in a lot of anger from those still supporting this regime .
It also resulted in one person setting up a Reddit wiki on impeachment .
Now people interested in continuing the impeachment activism can do so there .
Not that we should be run-off of Reddit of course .
🙂
I ’m actually suprised by this development since I ’ve noticed a systemattic ( and seemingly automated at times ) attack on any postings about impeachment .
There seem to be people ( or machines ) knocking down impeachment posts .
Apparently the support became to great to be ignored .
P.S. : The immediate knocking down of this post is a good example .
P.P.S. : Hmm .
Now that I brought attention to the knocking down , it ’s heading up again . 🙂
Judiciary Subcommittee subpoenas four fired US attorneys RAW STORY
Published : Thursday March 1 , 2007 Print This Email This From a release .
The story was first reported in The Hill .
# Washington - House Judiciary Committee John Conyers today issued subpoenas against certain former U.S. Attorneys who were recently fired by the Bush Administration .
The subpoenas were authorized by the Judiciary Subcommittee on Administrative Law ( CAL ) , chaired by Congresswoman Linda SÃ¡nchez .
The subpoenas require former U.S. Attorneys David C. Iglesias , Carol Lam , H.E. Cummins , III , and John McKay to appear before a CAL Subcommittee hearing next week .
" The former U.S. Attorneys are alleging very serious charges against the Administration and we need to hear from them , " Chairman Conyers said .
" We want to hear their stories and we want the Administration to address the charges head on so that we can get to the bottom of this . "
" We decided to issue subpoenas only as a last resort , " said Chairwoman SÃ¡nchez .
" We need to get to the bottom of whether competency in upholding the law is being sacrificed for political ideology . "
Subcommittee members voted this afternoon in a public meeting .
The subpoenas will be issued this evening for the U.S. Attorneys to appear before the subcommittee on Tuesday , March 6 , at 2:00 pm in Room 2141 of the Rayburn House Office Building .
The hearing will consider a bill by Congressman Howard Berman that would reverse a new provision in the USA PATRIOT
Act allowing the Attorney General to indefinitely appoint federal prosecutors through the end of the Bush Administration without Senate confirmation .
I 've written before about Karl Weick , a psychologist from The University of Michigan .
Karl is one of our most imaginative theorists , and also a gracious person who cares deeply about ideas .
I 've written about his argument that the right attitude for learning and creativity is to " argue as if you are right and listen as if you are wrong , " which strikes me as the right path for developing strong opinions , weakly held , as they advocate at the Institute for the Future .
The reactions that I got to Weick 's ideas about arguing and listening reminded me of an exercise that I use in a doctoral class that I teach every few years on " The Craft of Organizational Research . "
One theme is to help students identify the writings they love most , who their heroes are , who they want to be like when they grow - up -- so they can build a career that will enable them to do good work and to enjoy doing it .
As I say to them , my hero is Karl Weick .
I pick an excerpt from his 1989 Academy of Management Review article called " Theory Building as Disciplined Imagination " as it weaves together Karl 's keen observational powers , knowledge of empirical research , and his uncanny knack for blending diverse ideas in ways that surprise and delight his readers .
First , let me set the stage for his quote .
Weick was writing about the notion that good theorists should like new evidence that disconfirms their ideas , as it speeds the process of building interesting theory .
But then he goes on to say that this does n't always happen because , once a theorist has a strong investment in a theory and has well - organized defenses and ideas about that theory , and is planning to spread the theory , new ideas ( especially disconfirming evidence ) will likely be experienced as upsetting to him or her -- even if they improve the theory -- because such interruptions throw a monkey wrench in current plans , causing the person to go through new cognitive effort and threatening to destroy something that he or she has worked hard to build and defend -- and I would add to often lash and destroy the offending ideas and evidence ( and perhaps the person who has them ) .
Then he adds this statement about generalists and specialists :
Generalists , people with moderately strong attachments to many ideas , should be hard to interrupt , and once interrupted , should have weaker , shorter negative negative reactions since they have alternative paths to realize their plans .
Specialists , people with stronger attachments to fewer ideas , should be easier to interrupt , and once interrupted , should have stronger , more sustained negative reactions because they have fewer alternative pathways to realize their plans .
Generalists should be the the upbeat , positive people in the profession while specialists should be their grouchy , negative counterparts ( page 526 ) .
I do n't know about the people that you work with , but in my field -- although I wo n't name any names -- this theory works pretty well .
The people who have devoted their lives to developing just one idea or a few seem most grumpy to me .
And it makes sense .
If you believe in just one idea very strongly , new information either supports it ( that is not an interruption , just more signs you are right , so you can hum along ) , challenges it ( so you have to change the one thing you know and love or attack the idea ) , or it is an irrelevant distraction from the one little would that really matters to you ( your one true pet theory , that you have devoted so much effort to building ) .
This logic not only applies to academics , I 've heard my wife argue that the grumpiest lawyers are those who are so specialized that " they know almost everything about something that is so narrow and obtuse that it seems like almost nothing , " these ultra-specialists often have no interest in other law , client 's related business problems , or what other lawyers do .
And , like ultra-specialists in other fields , they believe that others are really too naive and stupid to understand their precious , well - developed , but very specialized ideas .
I wonder , does Weick 's observation ring true for other occupations ?
Note this is an untested hypothesis as far as I know , but it sure is interesting .

About 18,000 children die every day because of hunger and malnutrition , and 850 million people go to bed every night with empty stomachs , a “ terrible indictment of the world in 2007 , ” the head of the U.N. food agency said .
James Morris called for students and young people , faith - based groups , the business community and governments to join forces in a global movement to alleviate and eliminate hunger -- especially among children .
Morris , former president of the Lilly Endowment , one of the largest charitable organizations in the United States , is stepping down as executive director of the Rome - based World Food Program in April after five years of leading the world ’s largest humanitarian organization .
He said the percentage of people who are hungry has decreased from a fifth of the world ’s population to a sixth , but the number of hungry people is growing by about 5 million a year because of the rising population .

“ Today 850 million people are hungry and malnourished .
Over half of them are children ; 18,000 children die every single day because of hunger and malnutrition , ” Morris said .
“ This is a shameful fact , a terrible indictment of the world in 2007 , and it ’s an issue that needs to be solved . ”
The accord struck by the U.S. and its partners to limit and eventually dismantle North Korea 's nuclear program resembles one signed in 1994 by President Bill Clinton , a deal President George W. Bush denounced .
Bush , in his January 2003 State of the Union address , criticized the Clinton - negotiated Agreed Framework , saying Kim Jong Il 's government all along ``was deceiving the world '' and developing nuclear weapons .
Bush abandoned the deal in 2002 after North Korea admitted it had violated the accord , which offered energy aid for an end to the nuclear effort .
Since then , the U.S. has remained suspicious of any arrangement that would provide oil or other support to North Korea before Kim 's dictatorship verifiably shut down the program .
`` The North Koreans cheated '' on the 1994 agreement , Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said in October after North Korea tested a nuclear device .
Now , some argue , Bush has been forced to backtrack on some of his principles and adopt the Clinton approach because of the growing threat North Korea poses to U.S. national security interests after the October test - blast .
`` We should n't pretend that this is a significant advance over the 1994 Agreed Framework , '' said Robert Einhorn , who was assistant secretary of state for nonproliferation under Clinton .
The agreement ``defers most of the hard issues , '' he said .
Strange Bedfellows
The deal has created some strange bedfellows for Bush .
Bill Richardson , a Democratic presidential candidate and former United Nations ambassador under Clinton , was among the first to praise the new accord , while Bush 's most recent UN envoy , John Bolton , was one of the first to attack it .
Senator Christopher Dodd , a Connecticut Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee , said this week 's agreement ``looks very much '' like the Clinton deal .
Bush 's spokesman , Tony Snow , asserted the newest agreement was stronger than Clinton 's two - way accord because it includes China , Japan , Russia and South Korea , and holds North Korea to short - term benchmarks for compliance .
Rice echoed that position .
`` All six parties are the guarantors of this agreement , and there is great interest in the rest of the region to see that it is fully implemented , '' Rice told reporters .
Like the 1994 accord , the new agreement takes a step - by - step approach in which the North Koreans will be given specific forms of aid in return for taking specific steps to dismantle their nuclear program , said Desaix Anderson , a retired U.S. diplomat who headed the organization set up to administer aid under the 1994 deal .
` Back to That Track '
`` It gets us almost back to where we were in 2001 , but not all the way back , '' Anderson said .
`` Six years later , I give them credit for getting back to that track . ''
Anderson said the new accord has one principal advantage over the older one : it calls for a complete dismantling of North Korea 's key nuclear facility within a matter of months , while the earlier agreement had a longer timeline .
Under the arrangement , North Korea would shut down and seal the plutonium - producing Yongbyon facility within 60 days , and in return receive the equivalent of 50,000 tons of heavy fuel oil for electricity production .
The agreement was struck after six days of talks in Beijing among the six governments in the disarmament talks .
Football Analogy
Rice , employing an American football analogy , acknowledged that the deal was only an initial step toward ridding the Korean peninsula of nuclear weapons - related material .
This is ``still the first quarter , '' she said .
`` There is still a lot of time to go on the clock .
But the six parties have now taken a promising step in the right direction . ''
Rice also distinguished between what Clinton offered and what Bush is offering now .
Rice , who said she called negotiator Christopher Hill in Beijing at 4:15 a.m.
Washington time yesterday to make sure the deal held overnight , stressed that the construction of a light - water reactor for North Korea could be discussed ``only when the North Koreans have gotten back into good graces and fully dismantled . ''
``So this is a different agreement , '' she said .
`` It is an agreement that is also more comprehensive in scope . ''
Critics disagree .
Bolton took aim at the deal on CNN within hours of its announcement , calling it ``very bad '' and asserting that ``it contradicts fundamental premises of the president 's policy he 's been following for the past six years . ''
` The Same Thing '
Bolton said it was a ``repetition '' of the Clinton framework .
`` This is the same thing that the State Department was prepared to do six years ago , '' he said .
`` If we 're going to cut this deal now , it 's amazing that we did n't cut it back then . ''
Since Bush turned away from the Agreed Framework , North Korea has reprocessed 8,000 nuclear fuel rods into fissionable material that could be used to produce weapons , Anderson said .
A limitation of this initial deal is that it only addresses the activities at the 5 - megawatt reactor at Yongbyon reactor that makes enough plutonium to produce one nuclear bomb a year .
North Korea has also acknowledged -- and subsequently denied -- the possession of a highly enriched uranium program that is not addressed in yesterday 's deal .
Rice said the U.S would continue to pursue the matter .
`` The goal is the complete , verifiable and irreversible denuclearization of the Korean peninsula , '' she said .
`` This is a good beginning to that effort . ''
According to Andrei Lankov , an historian at Seoul 's Kookmin University who specializes in North Korea , the agreement is n't necessarily faulty but its timing is .
`` The Americans have been refusing to sign anything like this for years , but changed their minds as soon as North Korea tested the nuclear device , '' he said via email .
`` If this is not a surrender to blackmailers , I do not know what is .
In the future when the North Koreans need more aid , they will know how to get it : do something as provocative as they can . ''
From CBC News , Canada :
There may be a little Neanderthal in all of us .
That 's the conclusion of anthropologists who have re-examined 30,000 - year - old fossilized bones from a Romanian cave - bones that languished in a drawer since the 1950s *.
According to the researchers , these early Homo sapien bones show anatomical features that could only have arisen if the adult female in question had Neanderthal ancestors as part of her lineage .
The findings may answer nagging questions : Did modern humans and Neanderthals interbreed on a significant scale ?
And were the Neanderthals exterminated about 28,000 years ago - as some anthropologists contend - or did they gradually assimilate into the gene pool of people living today ?
" From my perspective , the replacement vs. continuity debate that raged through the 1990s is now dead , " said the study 's American co-author , Erik Trinkaus ( homepage ) , a professor of anthropology at Washington University in St. Louis .
* The human bones were first identified at the Pestera Muierii ( Cave of the Old Woman ) cave in 1952 .

Early modern humans from the Pestera Muierii , Baia de Fier , Romania
Abstract
The early modern human remains from the Pestera Muierii , Romania have been directly dated to {approx}30,000 radiocarbon years before present ( {approx}30 ka 14C BP ) ( {approx}35 ka cal BP ) ( " calendrical " age ; based on CalPal 2005 ) and augment a small sample of securely dated , European , pre-28 ka 14C BP ( {approx}32.5 ka cal BP ) modern human remains .
The Muierii fossils exhibit a suite of derived modern human features , including reduced maxillae with pronounced canine fossae , a narrow nasal aperture , small superciliary arches , an arched parietal curve , zygomatic arch above the auditory porous , laterally bulbous mastoid processes , narrow mandibular corpus , reduced anterior dentition , ventral - to - bisulcate scapular axillary border , and planoconcave tibial and fibular diaphyseal surfaces .
However , these traits co-occur with contextually archaic and / or Neandertal features , including a moderately low frontal arc , a large occipital bun , a high coronoid process and asymmetrical mandibular notch , a more medial mandibular notch crest to condylar position , and a narrow scapular glenoid fossa .
As with other European early modern humans , the mosaic of modern human and archaic / Neandertal features , relative to their potential Middle Paleolithic ancestral populations , indicates considerable Neandertal / modern human admixture .
Moreover , the narrow scapular glenoid fossa suggests habitual movements at variance with the associated projectile technology .
The reproductive and scapulohumeral functional inferences emphasize the subtle natures of behavioral contrasts between Neandertals and these early modern Europeans .

Lucknow is the cultural centre of India famous for its monuments , Nababs and delicious food .
The ' tehzib ' or mannerism is still thriving and is a matter of pride for Lucknow folks .
This is a city that still speaks the language of " aap - janab " ( you sir ) and the dictum of " pehle aap " ( after you ) is still a part of everyday life for a true Lakhnawi .
It all comes naturaly to Lucknow .
Lucknawi Aadab or salutation which has its own sophistication and style .
Wisdom , women and wine are the three things truly understood and respected by the Nawabs .
Not a thing of condemnation but an institution it was the kothas " , where sons of Nawabs were deliberately sent to learn the culture , sophistication and respect for the fairer sex .
In this seriees of food videos from City of culture Lucknow the first on is Tokari chat ( Basket snack mix ) .
The peculiar thing was its basket which was made up of potato , i.e. whole preparation was made in a basket of potato .
The taste was mindblowing .

Trump and Biden brace for ' barroom brawl ' in first debate

Abstract
Courts and scholars have increasingly assumed that intellectual property is a form of property , and have applied the economic insights of Harold Demsetz and other property theorists to condemn the use of intellectual property by others as " free riding . "
In this article , I argue that this represents a fundamental misapplication of the economic theory of property .
The economics of property is concerned with internalizing negative externalities - harms that one person 's use of land does to another 's interest to it , as in the familiar tragedy of the commons .
But the externalities in intellectual property are positive , not negative , and property theory offers little or no justification for internalizing positive externalities .
Indeed , doing so is at odds with the logic and functioning of the market .
From this core insight , I proceed to explain why free riding is desirable in intellectual property cases except in limited circumstances where curbing it is necessary to encourage creativity .
I explain why economic theory demonstrates that too much protection is just as bad as not enough protection , and therefore why intellectual property law must search for balance , not free riders .
Finally , I consider whether we would be better served by another metaphor than the misused notion of intellectual property as a form of tangible property .
As I was about to pack up and leave work for the Christmas vacation , I undocked my laptop and placed it into my bag .
I forgot to send an email so I pulled it back out and redocked it .
The computer started up fine , loaded Windows and then froze .
I rebooted and that ’s when I saw “ 1781 Disk 1 Failure ” on the screen , right after BIOS post .
My stomach sank , I knew it was n’t good .
Since everyone was already gone for the weekend , I packed up and went off to buy some last minute Christmas gifts .
When I got home , I tried powering it up again and it displayed the same error message .
I googled , “ HD Failure ” and the first link was this .
It recommended removing the hard drive and placing it in the freezer anywhere from 2 - 12 hours .
I placed the drive in a ziploc bag and put it in the freezer ( see above photo ) .
After about 8 hours , I put it back in and to my amazement disbelief , the machine booted up without any issues .
I have n’t tried rebooting yet , I ’m still waiting for all my data to copy .
I was very skeptical , but this actually works !
It has been proposed that succinctness is power .
I have some sympathy with this view ; if " power " means anything when we are talking about programming languages , a more powerful language is one that can do more with the same human effort .
Human effort in programming -- design , comprehension , construction , and debugging -- correlates closely with the amount of source text , so in general , less verbose programs require less effort .
Still , other things affect the effort required , too ; some are linguistic , others are not .
For example , good error reporting drastically decreases the time required to find and fix problems .
This matters in proportion to the number of errors you make and how good you are at guessing about their causes -- novices make a lot of errors and can't guess , while superprogrammers make few and can be pretty good at guessing .
Error reporting depends crucially on redundancy .
Knuth has said [ 0 ]
TeX would be easier to program in if it had more redundancy in the language .
Perl eliminates most redundant data - type conversions -- programs are more succinct , but errors are easier .
( In one Perl program , I had a list of LIST references comprising a two - dimensional array of numbers .
A loop over this list incorrectly referred to $ list [ $ i ] rather than $ list [ $ i ] [ $j ] , and so my program happily multiplied memory addresses by integers and got astronomical , and wrong , answers . )
Languages with different kinds of end tags , like Ada and XML , can usually tell you exactly which end tag you left out or inserted one extra of ; languages that use only right parens cannot .
The greater the probability a random string is a valid program , the harder it is to report errors well .
Type -checking depends on redundancy ; if any operator can be applied to any type , as in Forth , your only indication of type errors will be your incorrect answers or crashes , while if types are only checked by primitive operations , the error may be reported a long way from where the type error occurs .
When I pass a value of the wrong type to a Python library , the ensuing error message often takes a bit of noodling to connect with my own code .
Redundancy , of course , reduces succinctness .
Another sink of effort is looking things up in manuals .
I have to spend a lot of time looking things up when I work in Python ; I can rarely remember the argument sequence for re.sub ( ) , for example , while Perl 's more idiosyncratic syntax is easier to remember .
No doubt I would find it much easier to remember argument order for Smalltalk methods .
pydoc helps a lot ; just being able to type ' pydoc re.sub ' instead of navigating through the HTML manuals is a big help .
Having pydoc access from Emacs while I was editing Python programs would help even more ; Emacs has supported that kind of thing in C for a long time with M-x man .
Joel Spolsky , a fan of Microsoft 's development environments , recently pointed out [ 1 ] that static typing allows syntax - directed editors to prompt you with method signatures , which Microsoft 's development environments actually do .

In an exciting scientific breakthrough , I believe I figured out how to slow down the passage of time at my office on Monday .
It ’s complicated to replicate the conditions , so pay attention : for whatever reason , yesterday as I ’m headed to the Men ’s room at work , I notice that this co-worker who I do n’t really know all that well is headed in at the same time as me , and purely aribtrarily , I end up walking into one of the stalls , instead of standing at the urinal , which is where he ends up .
As I ’m in the stall peeing , I think , “ I wonder if he thinks it ’s weird that I did n’t stand next to him .
I wonder if he ’s taking it personally ? ”
As we both finish up and head to the sinks to wash up , I decide maybe I ’ll tell him it ’s nothing personal , and that I just randomly decided to pee in a stall for an exciting change of pace , but then I re -think that idea , because telling another guy your pee location strategy provides too much insight into the inner workings of your mind , at least , according to Sun - Tzu .
So I do n’t say anything , but then it ’s really weighing on my mind , that he ’s probably sitting over at his desk , thinking , “ Jonathan ’s a creepy urinater , ” or he ’s probably calling his friends and telling them .
Or maybe he ’s prepping an email to the whole company , and then going in and unselecting my address , to let them know that I ’m pee-shy and have to hide in a stall when others are present ( which is totally not true , I can pee anywhere , anytime ! ) .
So in the end , I feel like the only thing to do is send him an email ; but I realize that doing so will just be extremely queer , so I decide to go way over the top with it , and maybe , just maybe it ’ll be so bizarre that he forgets the original incident that necessitated the email .
So I write “ Hey , I hope you did n’t think it was weird that I went into a stall just now instead of using a urinal ; the thing is , I have a really unusually shaped penis & I did n’t want any of my co-workers to find out .
So , now that you know … just do n’t tell anyone . ”
And I hit send .
And then I wait … and wait … and eventually , after 90 minutes with no response , I realize he ’s probably prepping a lawsuit , or maybe he ’s already in with the HR lady .
So I get up and go over to his desk , and he looks up at me , and as I ’m waiting for him to speak , I realize he ’s wondering what I ’m doing there , like , maybe I ’m there to show him my penis or something .
So I blurt out “ hey , just so you know , I do n’t really have an abnormally shaped penis “ .
And that , ladies and gentlemen , is how you slow down time .
What felt like three minutes passed over the next few seconds before he stammered out , “ I have no idea what you ’re talking about ” .
Apparently , he had n’t even read the email , because he ’d been in a meeting & gone straight to lunch afterwards .
I explained , which I ’m sure made everything 100 % better .
Later on , we all looked back on it and had a good laugh , or rather , one of us wrote about the incident in his blog while the other one filed a report with Human Resources .
FEW American neighbourhoods are so exuberantly Mexican as Boyle Heights in east Los Angeles .
Paintings of the Virgin Mary adorn walls around César Chávez Avenue .
Local shops advertise productos oaxaqueños .
Immigrants from south of the border , particularly the kind who carry dodgy Social Security cards , still fetch up in the area .
But not as often as they did , according to Nativo Lopez , a Hispanic political activist who keeps an office in Boyle Heights .
“ This is no longer the west coast Ellis Island , ” he says .
Just under 1 m illegal immigrants are thought to live in Los Angeles County .
That is twice as many as in any other American metropolis .
Yet the number may have peaked .
This month the Urban Institute , a think - tank , estimated that the county lost some 15,000 illicit residents between 2002 and 2004 .
In the same period America as a whole added more than 1 m .
Los Angeles 's illegal immigrants are relatively old ( only 42 % are under 30 , compared with 49 % nationwide ) and more likely to have American children .
That suggests many will soon become citizens .
There are two reasons for this change .
The first is that people who steal across the border or quietly outstay their visas now avoid Los Angeles , just as they increasingly bypass other traditional gateways such as New York and Chicago .
The number of immigrants , both legal and illegal , arriving in Los Angeles has fallen since 1990 ( see chart ) .
In that year one out of every six recent immigrants lived in the metropolis .
By 2005 the proportion was one in 14 .
Increasingly , Mexican immigrants instead head to midwestern and southern states such as Ohio , Georgia and Texas .
Construction sites and meat - packing plants there used to recruit many Hispanic labourers from California and other American states , says Jeffrey Passel , a demographer at the Pew Hispanic Centre .
Now they are more likely to draw people from south of the border .
Few people associate Dallas with illegal immigrants , but the Texas city has more of them as a proportion of its population than does Los Angeles .
The second reason why the number of illegal immigrants in Los Angeles has levelled off is that many are leaving the city .
Emilio Amaya , who counsels unauthorised immigrants in San Bernardino , 55 miles ( 90 km ) east of downtown Los Angeles , says that between two - and three - tenths of his clients report that they moved there from the city .
San Bernardino is currently 56 % Hispanic , and growing .
The migrants are lured partly by a boom in unskilled jobs .
San Bernardino and Riverside Counties process much of the cargo that arrives in the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach .
As trade with China increases , so does the need for huge warehouses — one , currently under construction , is the size of eight Manhattan city blocks — and workers to build and toil in them .
These two dusty , sprawling counties , together known as the Inland Empire , are doing something that is almost unheard of in America these days : creating manufacturing jobs .
There are other good reasons to leave Los Angeles .
Maria , who moved out before she became a permanent resident and is now studying for a citizenship test in a San Bernardino shopping mall , provides three .
Housing is much cheaper there than in Los Angeles , she says .
The schools are better .
And local gangs , although they are growing , are not nearly as entrenched as they are in the big city .
In short , illegal immigrants are leaving Los Angeles for the same reasons most people do .
The difference is that their new neighbours are unlikely to welcome them with open arms .
Several towns in the Inland Empire have passed resolutions against illegal immigrants and the companies that hire them .
Wehirealiens.com , a website that collects allegations against employers , was founded by a software developer in Riverside County .
By following jobs from cities to suburbs and small towns , illegal immigrants often move from staunchly Democratic districts to strongly Republican ones .
Rob Paral , a researcher , has used census returns to estimate the numbers of illegal immigrants who were living in various congressional districts in 2005 .
His work supports the argument , often made by proponents of more liberal immigration laws , that illicit workers tend to reside in Democratic areas .
But it also shows that this pattern is changing fast .
Between 2000 and 2005 the number of illegal immigrants in California 's Democratic districts grew by 8 % .
In Republican areas the illegal population swelled by 36 % .
The same trend is evident elsewhere .
The 15th congressional district in Harlem , one of the most invincibly Democratic places in New York or anywhere else , seems to have shed illegals .
So has the district on the northern edge of Chicago that elected Rahm Emanuel , a powerful Democrat .
Meanwhile , the number of illegal immigrants went up by 50 % in the mostly suburban Illinois constituency of Dennis Hastert , the former Republican speaker of the House of Representatives .
Indeed , across America , where comparisons are possible , Democratic districts added undocumented residents at half the rate of Republican ones .
That helps to explain why Republican candidates talked so much about illegal immigration before last year 's mid-term elections .
In some ways , the disappearance of illegal immigrants is good news for Los Angeles .
It takes pressure off public services : the proportion of schoolchildren who are classified as “ English learners ” , for example , has fallen from a peak of 47 % in the mid-1990s to 41 % today .
And it makes it easier for the city 's large Hispanic population to rise into the middle class .
As a group , Hispanics had been weighed down by poorly educated new arrivals .
Yet the fact that people are being drawn away from places like Los Angeles is worrying , too .
Illegal immigrants are the canaries in the economic coal mine , sensitive to the slightest changes in the job market .
Their presence in a city may cause problems , but their departure suggests that a place is losing some of its economic dynamism .
After all , most cities , if they could choose , would rather have San Bernardino 's problems than Harlem's .

Elite special forces troops being dropped behind enemy lines on covert missions are to ditch their traditional parachutes in favour of strap - on stealth wings .
The lightweight carbon fibre mono - wings will allow them to jump from high altitudes and then glide 120 miles or more before landing - making them almost impossible to spot , as their aircraft can avoid flying anywhere near the target .
The technology was demonstrated in spectacular fashion three years ago when Austrian daredevil Felix Baumgartner - a pioneer of freefall gliding - famously ' flew ' across the English Channel , leaping out of an aircraft 30,000ft above Dover and landing safely near Calais 12 minutes later .
Wearing an aerodynamic suit , and with a 6ft wide wing strapped to his back , he soared across the sea at 220 mph , moving six feet forward through the air for every one foot he fell vertically - and opened his parachute 1,000 ft above the ground before landing safely .
' Massive potential '
Now military scientists have realised the massive potential for secret military missions .
Currently special forces such as the SAS rely on a variety of parachute techniques to land behind enemy lines - or else they must be dropped by helicopter .
Existing steerable square parachutes can be used - opened at high altitude of 27,000 ft - but jumpers then have to struggle to control them for long periods , often in high winds and extreme cold , while breathing from an oxygen tank to stay alive .
Alternatively they can freefall from high altitude , opening their parachutes at the last possible minute , but that limits the distance they can ' glide ' forward from the drop point to just a few miles .
Now German company ESG has developed the strap - on rigid wing specifically for special forces use .
Resembling a 6 ft - wide pair of aircraft wings , the devices should allow a parachutist to glide up to 120 miles , carrying 200lb of equipment , the manufacturers claim .
Fitted with oxygen supply , stabilisation and navigation aides , troops wearing the wings will jump from a high - altitude transport aircraft which can stay far away from enemy territory - or on secret peacetime missions could avoid detection or suspicion by staying close to commercial airliner flight paths .
The manufacturers claim the ESG wing is ' 100 per cent silent ' and ' extremely difficult ' to track using radar .
Once close to their target landing zone , the troops pull their parachute rip cord to open their canopy and then land normally .
Weapons , ammunition , food and water can all be stowed inside the wing , although concealing the 6ft wings after landing could prove harder than burying a traditional parachute .
ESG claims the next stage of development will be fitting ' small turbo - jet drives ' to the wings to extend range even further .
According to SAS insiders , very few operational parachute jumps have taken place in recent years , with teams tending to rely more on helicopters or other means of transport .
Supporters of the new mono - wing technology hope it will give a new lease of life to parachute tactics in the special forces world .
The Ministry of Defence would not comment on any equipment used by special forces , but is expected to evaluate the new system for use by UK special forces .
The upper - most layers of rock in many areas of Valles Marineris on Mars have been stripped away by erosion , providing a glimpse of the subsurface that was once buried deep underground .
Some fractures in the rock show evidence of fluid alteration , yielding clues into the ancient fluid chemistry and habitability of the subsurface .
A Mars-orbiting spacecraft has spotted a subterranean natural plumbing system that might have ferried water beneath the surface of the red planet in the distant past .
New images taken by the HiRISE camera on NASA 's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter ( MRO ) show hills and plateaus with alternating layers of dark and light colored rocks in Candor Chasma , one of several canyons that make up Valles Marineris , a sprawling Martian rift valley that is longer than the contiguous United States and up to seven times deeper than the Grand Canyon in places .
Image 1 of 1
Cutting like a vertical scar across these light and dark bands in Candor Chasma are a series of linear cracks surrounded by " halos " of light - colored bedrock [ image ] .
Pipes in bedrock
In the Feb. 16 issue of the journal Science , University of Arizona researchers Chris Okubo and Alfred McEwen argue that the halos are proof that some form of fluid - either water , liquid carbon dioxide or a combination of the two - once flowed through the bedrock .
The timing of the flow remains uncertain , the researchers say , and could have occurred many millions or even billions of years ago .
They suggest that liquid flowing through the fractures deposited iron - rich or clay - like minerals in the rock .
The minerals would act like cement to strengthen the layers of rock and also bleach it a lighter color .
Over millions of years , wind stripped away the top layers of surface rock , exposing the subsurface and its plumbing system to the light of day .
The linear cracks , called joints , are about a meter wide and range from several hundred meters to several kilometers in length .
How the joints formed is still a mystery , but once formed , they would have provided a conduit for flowing liquid , the researchers speculate .
" They acted sort of like pipes through the bedrock , " Okubo told SPACE.com .
Video : Life on Mars ?
Earth analogy
Similar processes are known to occur on Earth .
Veins of gold and silver in rock , for example , are formed when water rich in the dissolved forms of these elements flows through cracks and finally deposit the metals as bright streaks in the rock .
Okubo says the new findings could have implications for life on Mars , either in the distant past and perhaps even the present .
By being underground , the " fluid can remain in place for a longer period of time , " Okubo said .
" That will allow for the geochemical reactions to occur more thoroughly and more profusely through the rock , perhaps giving rise to habitable oases within the protected subsurface for any biologic activity to occur . "
Philip Christensen , a leading Mars researcher at Arizona State University , said the team 's explanation for the joints is very plausible , but points out that the liquid that once flowed through the cracks might also have been volcanic magma .
Molten magma flows like liquid and can also alter the color of surrounding rocks , Christensen said .
It looks as if " fluid was injected into these cracks .
The question is what was the fluid ?
Was it water or was it volcanic ? "
Christensen added , however , that there are no large volcanoes in the Candor Chasma region photographed by the MRO , so " water moving through those fractures is probably more likely than volcanic material . "
Speech of Benjamin Franklin
Monday , September 17 , 1787 , was the last day of the Constitutional Convention .
Pennsylvania delegate Benjamin Franklin , one of the few Americans of the time with international repute , wanted to give a short speech to the Convention prior to the signing of the final draft of the Constitution .
Too weak to actually give the speech himself , he had fellow Pennsylvanian James Wilson deliver the speech .
It is considered a masterpiece .
The following is as reported in Madison 's notes on the Convention for Monday , September 17 , 1787 .
Mr. President
I confess that there are several parts of this constitution which I do not at present approve , but I am not sure I shall never approve them :
For having lived long , I have experienced many instances of being obliged by better information , or fuller consideration , to change opinions even on important subjects , which I once thought right , but found to be otherwise .
It is therefore that the older I grow , the more apt I am to doubt my own judgment , and to pay more respect to the judgment of others .
Most men indeed as well as most sects in Religion , think themselves in possession of all truth , and that wherever others differ from them it is so far error .
Steele a Protestant in a Dedication tells the Pope , that the only difference between our Churches in their opinions of the certainty of their doctrines is , the Church of Rome is infallible and the Church of England is never in the wrong .
But though many private persons think almost as highly of their own infallibility as of that of their sect , few express it so naturally as a certain french lady , who in a dispute with her sister , said " I do n't know how it happens , Sister but I meet with no body but myself , that 's always in the right —
Il n'y a que moi qui a toujours raison . "
In these sentiments , Sir , I agree to this Constitution with all its faults , if they are such ; because I think a general Government necessary for us , and there is no form of Government but what may be a blessing to the people if well administered , and believe farther that this is likely to be well administered for a course of years , and can only end in Despotism , as other forms have done before it , when the people shall become so corrupted as to need despotic Government , being incapable of any other .
I doubt too whether any other Convention we can obtain , may be able to make a better Constitution .
For when you assemble a number of men to have the advantage of their joint wisdom , you inevitably assemble with those men , all their prejudices , their passions , their errors of opinion , their local interests , and their selfish views .
From such an assembly can a perfect production be expected ?
It therefore astonishes me , Sir , to find this system approaching so near to perfection as it does ; and I think it will astonish our enemies , who are waiting with confidence to hear that our councils are confounded like those of the Builders of Babel ; and that our States are on the point of separation , only to meet hereafter for the purpose of cutting one another 's throats .
Thus I consent , Sir , to this Constitution because I expect no better , and because I am not sure , that it is not the best .
The opinions I have had of its errors , I sacrifice to the public good .
I have never whispered a syllable of them abroad .
Within these walls they were born , and here they shall die .
If every one of us in returning to our Constituents were to report the objections he has had to it , and endeavor to gain partizans in support of them , we might prevent its being generally received , and thereby lose all the salutary effects & great advantages resulting naturally in our favor among foreign Nations as well as among ourselves , from our real or apparent unanimity .
Much of the strength & efficiency of any Government in procuring and securing happiness to the people , depends , on opinion , on the general opinion of the goodness of the Government , as well as of the wisdom and integrity of its Governors .
I hope therefore that for our own sakes as a part of the people , and for the sake of posterity , we shall act heartily and unanimously in recommending this Constitution ( if approved by Congress & confirmed by the Conventions ) wherever our influence may extend , and turn our future thoughts & endeavors to the means of having it well administred .
On the whole , Sir , I can not help expressing a wish that every member of the Convention who may still have objections to it , would with me , on this occasion doubt a little of his own infallibility , and to make manifest our unanimity , put his name to this instrument .
The National Energy Board issues reports on various aspects of Canadian energy production and use .
This is the main entry point for natural gas reports on its web site , and this is the entry point for more general energy reports that include sections on natural gas .
It is instructive to study the evolution of scenarios put forward for the future of gas supply from the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin .
The Western Canada Sedimentary Basin ( WCSB ) is one of the major gas - producing areas of North America .
It supplies about a quarter of all gas used by the US and Canada , and 98 % of Canadian production .
Current production is 450 million cubic metres a day .
To put this into perspective , this volume is close to half a cubic kilometre , and the mass of this much gas is 330,000 tonnes .
The 1999 report and the 2003 report on energy futures for Canada each show two " scenarios " for future gas production , and all four of these scenarios show a peak and subsequent decline in output of conventional gas from the basin .
The major difference lies in the timing of the peak and the output at peak .
In the 1999 report , the peak date is seen as being a decade away , but in the 2003 report , the peak is seen as having already passed in 2001 .
Assembling gas information from a number of sources ( The National Energy Board , Statistics Canada and Natural Resources Canada ) permits some interesting comparisons .
Click for larger image
In the figure , the red line shows the history of conventional gas output from the basin .
This information comes from NEB gas reports for 1976 to 1990 and Statistics Canada information for 1991 on , with coal bed methane production subtracted out for the last three years .
Coal bed methane production rose from zero to about 11 million cubic metres per day over those three years .
The dark blue and purple lines show the future scenarios envisaged in the 1999 report ( Figure 5.4 ) .
The light blue and yellow lines show scenarios from the 2003 report ( Figures 5.21 and 5.23 ) .
The brown line shows the number of new conventional gas " connections " made in each year in the WCSB , divided by 50 .
This information is taken from the gas short - term deliverability reports .
A " connection " refers to the connection of a gas well to a gas reservoir .
Since some wells connect to more than one reservoir , the number is generally somewhat higher ( by about 10 % ) than the number of successful wells .
It can be seen that while 6000 or fewer new connections per year were sufficient to get the supply up to 400 million cubic metres per day in 1995 , getting to 450 million cubic metres per day in 2001 and 2002 required something like 12000 per year , and that maintaining close to that production over the last few years has required an increase to 17000 new connections per year .
Two factors are at play here : the size of new gas deposits being accessed has been decreasing , and the early depletion rates for new connections have increased .
This means that the initial production from a new connection tends now to fall more rapidly than in the past .
This is at least in part a matter of choice - the " fracturing " of the rock around new connections makes it easier to obtain high initial gas flow rates , which reduces the number of new connections required to achieve a given total output , but at the cost of requiring more connections in future years , because the output of new connections , and thus total output , falls more quickly .
The initial depletion rate for new connections now seems to have stabilised at about 40 % for the first year , the decline slowing considerably thereafter , but the size of new deposits continues to decline .
This picture is very different from that envisaged in 1999 :
WCSB conventional production peaks at 21.6 billion cubic feet per day ( Bcf /d ) ( 612 million m3/d ) in 2013 for Case 1 and 18.9 Bcf /d ( 535 million m 3/d ) in 2008 for Case 2 ( Figure 5.4 ) .
More startlingly :
Successful conventional gas well completions in the WCSB rise to 7700 by 2013 in Case 1 .
The Case 2 completions peak at about 6000 in 2011 , reflecting the lower resources assumption ( Figure 5.5 ) .
The number of wells drilled will be higher because dry holes will increase the count ; however , this will be partially offset by multiple completions in the same well .
Based on an average success rate of 70 percent , the total wells drilled would peak at about 10000 and 8000 for Case 1 and Case 2 respectively .
This is startling for two reasons - not only does it mean that we are now drilling holes at well over twice the rate expected at higher and later peak production , but also that the drilling rate was already higher than predicted for peak in the year these scenarios were contemplated .
In the longer term , the basin 's conventional resources ( including undiscovered ) were seen as nearing exhaustion by 2025 :
In both cases , about 95 percent of the established reserves are produced by 2025 .
In Case 1 , 82 percent of the undiscovered resources is produced , whereas in Case 2 , 95 percent is produced .
The 2003 report shows two scenarios , called " Supply Push " and " Techno - Vert " .
The bases of these scenarios are described thus :
The Supply Push scenario represents a world in which technology advances gradually and Canadians take limited action with respect to the environment .
The main theme of this scenario is security of continental energy supply and the push to develop known conventional sources of energy .
The Techno - Vert scenario represents a world in which technology advances rapidly and Canadians take broad action with respect to the environment and the accompanying preference for environmentally - friendly products and cleaner - burning fuels .
Possible impact of the Kyoto protocol is not considered in either .
The report is somewhat equivocal on the likely size of the " resource base "
Through exploration drilling and development , industry ’s knowledge of the WCSB has improved and resource estimates have generally increased .
Continuous development of technology further enhances the ability to identify and exploit pools .
At the same time , improved information leads to a narrower range of estimates .
However , as with other basins , opinions still vary on the actual size of the WCSB resource base .
As technology improves and exploration increases in both scenarios , perhaps new geological concepts can be proved that would enable further increases to natural gas resource estimates .
However , recent drilling and production data suggests that the WCSB may be maturing ; and changes in natural gas resource estimates may be warranted for some areas .
The basis of the gas production in " Supply Push " is described thus :
Some resources in the WCSB are located in isolated areas or in small pools that may not be economical to develop at natural gas prices consistent with either scenario .
Consequently , 64 Tcf ( 1,813 billion m3 ) or 90 percent of the available undiscovered resources in the WCSB was utilized for determining deliverability in SP .
While for " Techno - Vert " , the basis is :
In TV , better economics through improved technology and higher natural gas prices , enable 92 Tcf ( 2,606 billion m3 ) or 95 percent of the available undiscovered resources to be used for determining deliverability .
The larger resource base in TV also allows deliverability from the WCSB to be maintained longer than in SP .
From comparison of the graphs above , it seems that the estimates of the " Resource Base " underwent a very significant contraction between 1999 and 2003 .
The amount of drilling required ( in either 2003 scenario ) is described as follows :
The supply profile for the WCSB assumes that drilling levels similar to those experienced in 2001 are maintained until about 75 percent of available resources have been produced .
At this point , the size of the remaining resource begins to limit prospective drilling locations and constrains production .
Both scenarios also assume that the producing characteristic of new wells would be similar to current wells in the same area .
One can see that drilling levels well above the 2001 numbers are now being used to achieve something like the output anticipated .
It seems that the last assumption is not holding up very well .
Decline rates remain stable , but the output ( initial and total ) of new connections has continued to fall , after briefly stabilising in 2001 - 2 .
The following figure , taken from the October 2006 short - term deliverability report , shows the output of an average connection for each of the years1998 - 2005 .
Note that this graph shows a plot of production rate vs. cumulative production , not time .

It would appear that output of conventional gas from the basin may not achieve that contemplated in either of the 2003 scenarios .
If this happens , output by 2025 could be well under half of present output .
Estimates of remaining reserves and resources for natural gas in North America may be found on the web site of Natural Resources Canada .

Figures like this lead to headlines about Canada having enough gas for 80 years ( divide total claimed by current production ) , so one might wonder how the beginning of a considerable decline in WCSB production would square with this information .
The numbers for the WCSB in this figure total 374 Tcf ( 10600 Bcm ) , but include in the " Undiscovered Resources " 80 Tcf ( 2300 Bcm ) of coal bed methane , leaving 294 Tcf ( 8300 Bcm ) of conventional gas .
A steady decline in production from 5.8 Tcf / year ( 164 Bcm / year ) in 2005 to half that in 2025 ( roughly consistent with the NEB 2003 " Techno - Vert " scenario ) would result in 87 Tcf ( 2450 Bcm ) being used in that period .
If we were to assume that the supply would continue to decline by a factor of two for each subsequent 20 - year period , the total conventional gas extracted ( over infinite time ) would be about 174 Tcf ( 4900 Bcm ) .
This is less than the " Reserves + Discovered Resources " sub-total , let alone the total including " Undiscovered Resources " .
Given that this estimate is based on a scenario that now seems improbable when one looks at recent drilling and output numbers , perhaps a further review of WCSB conventional resource estimates is overdue .
There are many variables that will affect conventional gas output from the WCSB .
A simple " number of connections " indicator does not show whether those connections are from shallow low - output wells or riskier , deeper higher - output wells .
A change in approach , perhaps in response to economic events , could result in better average new connection output .
It does seem unlikely , though , that this will have a major effect at what is a relatively late stage in the game for this basin .
The methods used to predict future flows assume that the output of existing wells will not be affected by drilling new ones in the same area .
If gas production rates are kept up by drilling multiple wells into the same gas deposit , this assumption will break down and more rapid declines may ensue .
This may well have happened with the Ladyfern deposit , for which a 70 % decline in output occurred in the first year , after a huge drilling effort .
Coal Bed Methane production is still at a very early stage .
How well it will be able to make up for the decline in conventional production remains to be seen .
The remaining gas estimates above for the rest of Canada total 226 Tcf ( 6400 Bcm ) .
By far the greater part of it is as yet in the " Undiscovered " category , and most of it is a long way ( sometimes thousands of kilometres ) from existing pipes .
The only area other than the WCSB that is now producing gas is the " Scotian Shelf " , and both its output and the estimated size of the resource are tiny by comparison .
The MacKenzie Delta will probably begin to produce gas at some time in the next few years , but this will entail a huge engineering project that will eventually deliver about 55 million cubic metres per day .
Getting gas from the Arctic islands , the Newfoundland offshore or some other frontier areas may well prove even more challenging than from the MacKenzie .
For more details of Canadian gas resources see another NEB report from April 2004 .
WCSB conventional gas and coal bed methane will provide the bulk of Canadian production for the foreseeable future , so a very significant decline in total supply looks probable .
A glance at the U.S. numbers in the figure above shows that gas situation in the lower 48 states is no less " mature " than that in the WCSB , and the likely future of production in North America as a whole is implied somewhat starkly in Jean Laherrere 's work , which also shows an estimate of future Canadian CBM production - about 1 Tcf / year or 75 million cubic metres per day in 2025 .
It seems highly improbable that imports of LNG will make up for more than a fraction of the overall decline , so get ready to use a lot less gas a decade from now .

The homemade endoscope was cheaper than professional ones
In Vietnam , there is a shortage of endoscopes , with normally only one in each province .
Endoscopy is a minimally invasive diagnostic procedure used to evaluate the interior surfaces of an organ by inserting a small scope in the body .
Through the scope , doctors are able to see lesions .
Dr Nguyen Phuoc
Huy said his hospital could never afford to buy one as the endoscope costs around $ 30,000 .
Instead he spent two years developing a DIY endoscope to peer inside the bodies of patients without the need for surgery .
Low cost system
The scope captures images from the body of a patient , which are then passed through a webcam to an analysis machine .
Dr Huy spent two years building the system
" In total I had to buy only the scope , which is about $ 800 , " Dr Huy told the BBC World Service programme Go Digital .
" A Pentium 4 computer with a colour printer is all that is needed for image processing .
" Using the Windows operating system , we have programs to record the images and put them in a database of patients . "
" I can now make a complete endoscope system in just one week . "
So far he has built one for himself and two for colleagues .
Technology novice

Huy started out as a medical doctor .
Whilst he knew all about the human body , he was no technology expert .
So he taught himself the basics of computing , optics and mathematics in his own time .
Three homemade systems have so far been built
" I also got advice on optics from physics teachers and I could design the optical apparatus in the lenses of my endoscope .
I even had to revisit my physics notebooks from high school , revise my mathematics . "
Dr Huy is set to make similar systems for other poor hospitals in Vietnam and even for medical centres in other countries .
But he says people still do not know much about his product .
Having learnt all about the technology , the next step for Dr Huy is getting to grip with the marketing techniques he will need to spread the word even further .

As time goes by , the potentialities of the World Wide Web grow bigger and bigger and are gradually reaching the beyond - restrictions line .
One of the indications of this huge progress of the Internet is the unlimited domain hosting option included in some popular web hosting platforms available online .
Domain web hosting will be a perfect match for you if you are planning to build multiple websites .
This is because you can keep multiple domains on one hosting account .
Most hosting services that offer unlimited domains will also give you access to the other services that they offer , as well as the ability to create sub - domains , databases , and email accounts for each of your domains .
Basically , domain hosting service opens up many opportunities for your online growth .
It enables you to host unlimited domain names and subdomains within one single website hosting account and to maintain unlimited websites that can be managed through separate FTP , email , database , domain control , etc. options .
All the domains that you can host in your account are fully qualified and can be either registered with the company you get this service from or somewhere else , but have to point to the company 's servers .
You can add as many new domains as you wish without any additional cost .
The only limit you will have will be the allowed quota of the other web hosting resources in your particular account such as disk space , monthly traffic , etc .
If your existing website has Domain Hosting , then you can add your second domain to the account .
All it takes is an FTP account that is supplied by the web host provider .
Many providers require a sub - folder that is created within the root folder of your current website .
Linux host provides you a great cost effective solution that enables you to host domains within one single web hosting account and manage unlimited websites from one location , greatly increasing your efficiency and substantially reducing cost .
You save a lot of money by using plan domain host as it allows you to host an unlimited number of websites using only one account .
It also saves you a lot of time and energy as you get to manage all your websites from a centralized location .
With the facility of plan based domain host , you can log into your account and administer features and services for each domain via the same control panel .
Plan based domain hosting can have several benefits for customers which need to be able to host several websites under a single hosting plan .
That does not go without consequences though as most hosting services which offer the multiple domains option will lack proper memory resources to cover several websites when they are accessed by a large number of website visitors .
This means that access to the sites may be restricted depending on a number of resources available .
It is up to the client to choose the options in multiple domains hosting that are appropriate for their needs .
Kurzweil 's The Singularity Is Near
Every twelve to eighteen months , according to the common interpretation of Moores Law , the performance of our computers ( measured against a fixed cost ) doubles .
It has done so for decades , and shows every indication of continuing for decades more .
In the early 90s , chess grandmaster Kasparov disparaged computer chess programs .
Yet a few years later , in 1997 , Deep Blue ( a fearsomely specialized computer built by IBM , running 256 customized modules ) beat Kasparov .
Five years later , Deep Fritz ( running on eight ordinary networked personal computers ) reached a draw with the then reigning grandmaster , Vladimir Kramnik .
Sometime within the next few years , software running on ordinary PCs will reach a chess ranking of  2800 ,  and effectively pass all human players for good .
For decades , during the early development of computers , the dream of a chess - playing program was seen as a fantasy or delusion .
But the people watching the development of such programs , in tandem with the changes in information technology and material science , were actually watching two different curves and predicting two different futures .
On the left , the linear progress of chess programs appeared pathetic for decades , but then suddenly the machines began beating novice and then mid-level players .
As the knee of the development curve was reached , progress shifted from pathetic to awesome in a relative eye blink .
Mapping development on a logarithmic plot during those bleak decades , however , such progress was both predictable and apparently inevitable .
Computing pioneer Ray Kurzweil has spent the last four decades thinking about the implications of such logarithmic curves across the fields of computation , science , and economic development and developed a general Law of Accelerating Returns .
Readers of Jim Bennetts Anglosphere Challenge will recognize the significance of exponential development on the Anglospheres relative advantage in coping with rapid change .
Kurzweil has now created a comprehensive presentation of the Singularity concept that is revolutionary in its implications and central to thinking about the Anglosphere .
Ray Kurweil has been working for many decades in the fields of artificial intelligence and more specialized applications such as speech recognition .
An author of earlier controversial books such as Age of Intelligent Machines ( 1990 ) , and Age of Spiritual Machines ( 2000 ) , he has gained a reputation for thinking vigourously about the implications of technology .
In his most recent book , he builds his discussion around the concept of the Singularity : a future period during which the pace of technological change will be so rapid , its impact so deep , that human life will be irreversibly transformed . 
Kurzweil proposes understanding cosmic history in a framework of six epochs of intelligence from the earliest epochs of planetary physics and chemistry , through the appearance of biological matter , brains , human technology , the emergence of machine intelligence , and finally the conversion of much of the universes matter to intelligence .
In other words , Kurzweil addresses the biggest of big pictures .
In a writing style that is clear , relentless , well - organized but not always easy for non-scientists , the author outlines the trends in scientific and technological development .
If those trends are stable ( and Kurzweil makes a careful and compelling argument that they are ) , then the implications for the development of increasingly powerful machine intelligence are substantial .
Through genetics , nanotechnology ( ultra - small machines ) , and robotics ( machine intelligence ) [ GNR ] , the constraints of supply and demand for all kinds of resources are tipped on their heads .
As an example we all understand , the evolution of computing equipment counter - intuitively consumes less energy and less material as it increases its computation power .
In tandem with the evolution of computer hardware and software is an ever - accelerating pace of scientific discovery in the material and biological sciences : highlighted most clearly to the general public over the last five years by work on the human genome  DNA .
This work , leveraging powerful IT developments , now offers the ability to understand , for the first time , how living systems work .
No more black box approximations that have been the hallmark of natural philosophy and science for millennia .
Suddenly , our own physiology and our own consciousness is being exposed to the same current of progress which once held sway over metallurgy and plastics .
More significant still , our understanding of human cognition , of how the human brain works at the molecular and neuronal level , is hitting that knee in the linear curve we are , Kurzweil suggests , just at the tip of discoveries about the human brain that will be as dramatic as that in genetics .
The resolution and image creation speeds of non-invasive brain - scanning equipment is progressing at exponential rates , doubling annually .
This means that finer and finer - grained images of the human brain can be created , monitored at higher speeds for finer and finer - grained understanding of not only what happens in the brain but in what sequence .
A moments thought will uncover just how significant such discoveries will be for ethics , philosophy , politics , and culture .
The Anglosphere , by any calculation , will be at the forefront of such challenges to the status quo .
We can expect a cascade of information about mental illness , genetic disease , the structure of human emotion , human creativity , and human decision - making .
Kurzweils argument leads from an introduction of the six epochs of evolution , through an excellent theory of technology evolution ( making extensive use of S - curves and logarithmic charts ) to a chapter on achieving the computational capacity of the human brain . 
By using scientific notation to track the cycles per second ( CPS ) and data / memory storage requirements ( bits ) of biological nervous systems , Kurzweil is able to map some likely milestones in machine intelligences convergence with the capacities of biological systems .
By his estimate , in 2020 , $ 1,000 of computing power will provide the functional equivalent of the human brain .
Another ten years will allow the discrete neuron - by - neuron simulation of a human brain .
By 2050 , computer power will be able to duplicate the mental computation of all humans on the planet .
Heady stuff , if youll pardon the pun .
By Kurzweils calculations , 2045 will mark the point at which the non-biological intelligence manufactured will be one billion times more powerful than all human intelligence today .
These prognostications triggered traditional responses .
Computation isnt intelligence , despite the fact that electronic circuits are one million times faster than the electrochemical signals of neurons .
Kurzweil answers the challenge by moving into a chapter on the achieving the software of human intelligence .
He points out that much of the human body is geared to accomplishing tasks with the suboptimal options offering by biological solutions .
A first step in working with the body , as we see today , is the replacement of complex biological systems with simpler mechanical solutions driven with IT ( insulin pumps , titanium joints , pacemakers , neuro - stimulators ) .
As the cascade of scientific understanding increases , however , it will become possible to duplicate neuronal and cellular structure with nanotechnological devices .
There will be two major strategies in duplicating human intelligence working from the bottom ( molecules / cells ) up and from the top ( function , memory , analytical capacities ) down .
At the point at which nanotechnology allows the direct interaction between device and neuron , humans will have the ability to alter their consciousness directly supplementing it as needed with machine - like capacities or moderating it as desired with familiar emotional states .
Revolutionary is an appropriate word .
Just to halt for a moment , its worth recalling that all of this sounds like science fiction however Kurzweils arguments are mapped directly onto those logarithmic curves showing what is already happening .
He is extrapolating conservatively from trends which have substantial histories and which are sustained by news we can read every day .
By consulting his websites ( AIKurweil.net and singularity.com ) , readers can monitor the very same leaps in scientific insight and refinement which he predicts in his book .
Flowing from a credible argument on the mapping and duplication of human intelligence in machine form by mid-century , Kurzweil turns to the three converging areas of genetics , nanotechnology and robotics to demonstrate that these areas share the exponential development pattern seen in computation and neuroscience .
It is the engagement of these three fields ( as they approach the knee of the linear progress curve ) that will offer some of the biggest surprises to the general public in coming years .
All three will draw from and feed back into the progress in computation and artificial intelligence .
Nanotechnology will provide both medical and intellectual breakthroughs .
Kurzweil leaves little doubt that he thinks that the race for baby boomers is to stay alive long enough to benefit from Singularity breakthroughs that make very , very long life not only possible but inevitable .
What will be the impact of the Singularity on different fields ?
Kurzweil devotes a substantial chapter on current and prospective changes in play for the human body and human brain , for human longevity , for warfare , work and play .
He is upfront about his views on intelligence in the universe and why , through calculation and observation , he believes were the first past the post in our galaxy on the evolutionary move to machine intelligence .
His cosmological comments are as intriguing and challenging as any relating to our everyday existence .
Kurzweil follows up his chapter on the impact of the Singularity with a discussion of what the Singularity will mean to individuals : to their personal considerations of consciousness , the definition of who am I ?
What am I ?
What is a meaningful life ?
If the modern world is stressing people over just those questions , the Singularity will be the issues into stark contrast .
Is the Singularity a religious Transcendence of the old sort ?
For Kurzweil , who proposes that most religious belief addresses individual death , a culture in which individual human death effectively stops , will have profound philosophy issues to consider .
What about the perils of such technology ?
On this subject , Kurzweil has had many years of writing and thinking .
As he points out , many of the current Cassandras ( e.g. Bill Joys very famous WIRED article  The Future Doesnt Need Us ) were informed about the issues by his articles and concerns in years past .
So while he is no Pollyanna on the subject of  the deeply intertwined promise and peril of GNR [ genetics , nanotechnology , and robotics ] he is optimistic that the challenges can be overcome .
More to the point , and of interest to the Anglosphere , he cannot imagine any effective social response to the relentless changes predicted by his logarithmic plots that would not risk totalitarianism .
While moratoria and constraints on some kinds of research are likely and possible from time to time , the nature of the Singularity means that disruptive ( and potentially destructive ) technology is more and more within reach of people and nations .
It remains for societies to adapt to such realities in the same way that they have to nuclear , chemical and biological warfare dangers .
In a final major chapter , Kurzweil addresses many of his critics ( both social and technological ) and it is here that we can see the shape of the controversies to come should his Singularity predictions pan out .
He addresses criticisms triggered by social concern ( incredulity , Malthusian limitations , vested industrial interests , rich - poor divide , governmental regulation , theism , holism ) and from narrower scientific skepticism ( software design , analog processing , microtubules and quantum computing , Church - Turing thesis , system failure rates ) .
The revolutionary nature of his arguments is reflected in the amazing breadth of people who are upset by his conclusions .
 The Singularity is Near is a thorough , substantive introduction to the concept of the Singularity introduced in the Anglosphere Challenge .
Kurzweils book is the result of years of research , thinking and debate so it offers as good an initial grounding in the subject as we are likely to see .
The profound philosophical and spiritual questions it raises are with us in seed form already and can only increase in importance with each passing year .
I think back to 1995 and saying to a college professor friend  You know , this Internet things going to be huge . 
After reading Kurzweils book , I m more than a little awestruck by what the next ten years might bring .
Im going to take some time to think through the implications for the Anglosphere ( and Jims concept ) specifically but my first hunch is that they will be similarly dramatic .

Republican Study Committee backtracks on accusations that Rep. Pelosi violated copyright law on her blog Josh Catone
Published : Thursday February 15 , 2007 Print This Email This Sponsored by : The Agenda with Joe Solmonese Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi ( D - CA ) recently launched a blog called " The Gavel , " which features a large number of YouTube clips of House proceedings .
Earlier today , the Republican Study Committee issued a press release accusing Pelosi of violating C - SPAN 's copyright by displaying those clips on her blog .
But the Speaker won this battle .
" Though we applaud the Speaker 's effort to adapt to new technology , the blog violated copyright and trademark law on the very first day , " the RSC press release stated .
" As of noon today , the Speaker had posted at least 16 videos that are copyrighted C - SPAN material from the House floor .
The RSC spoke with C - SPAN today , who confirmed that these videos violate C - SPAN copyright / trademark of the House proceedings . "
The problem ?
C-SPAN does n't claim a copyright to any footage of House proceedings because the cameras used are owned by Congress and not C - SPAN .
" That 's in the public domain , it 's owned by the American people , " Jennifer Moire , a spokesperson for the channel told the Associated Press .
The RSC retracted the release , which also accused Pelosi of " pirating C- SPAN footage for partisan purposes , " just two hours after issuing it , explaining that they were " given contradictory information . "
YOU CAN READ THE FULL AP REPORT HERE A copy of the press release is below : # FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE February 15 , 2007 Speaker Pelosi's New Blog Violates C-SPAN Copyright / Trademark of House Proceedings
Will the Speaker bring the gavel down on " the Gavel Blog ? "
As you may have heard , Speaker Nancy Pelosi launched a new blog entitled " The Gavel . "
Though we applaud the Speaker 's effort to adapt to new technology , the blog violated copyright and trademark law on the very first day .
Not once , not twice , but 16 times ?
As of noon today , the Speaker had posted at least 16 videos that are copyrighted C - SPAN material from the House floor .
The RSC spoke with C - SPAN today , who confirmed that these videos violate C - SPAN copyright / trademark of the House proceedings .
Using C - Span for partisan purposes ?
In addition to using pirated material , Speaker Pelosi also has used the pirated C - SPAN footage for partisan purposes .
The collection of C - SPAN footage used in her " first official blog " is an example and the other pirated C - SPAN trademarked material shows Democrat after Democrat offering their views of the non-binding Democrat resolution on the reinforcement and realignment of American troops in Iraq .
So , what does Speaker Pelosi believe the role of C - SPAN is ?
" One of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi 's first decisions was to deny a request by C - SPAN to be permitted to cover the House floor proceedings with its own cameras .
Last month , Pelosi sent a letter to C - SPAN Chairman and CEO Brian Lamb saying she believed " the dignity and decorum " of the House " are best preserved by maintaining the current system of televised proceedings . "
( CQ Weekly , January 15 , 2007 , Page 169 )
Is the dignity and decorum of the House preserved by pirating copyrighted C - SPAN material for political purposes ?
If not , will the Speaker bring the gavel down on " the Gavel Blog ? " Brad Dayspring Communications Director Republican Study Committee #
Algorithms and Assessment in Computer Poker
Darse Billings , Ph.D. dissertation , September 2006 .
This document is currently available in postscript and pdf .
Abstract :
The game of poker offers a clean well - defined domain in which to investigate some truly fundamental issues in computing science , such as how to handle deliberate misinformation , and how to make intelligent guesses based on partial knowledge .
In the taxonomy of games , poker lies at the opposite end of the spectrum from well - studied board games like checkers and chess .
Poker is a multi-player game with stochasticity ( random events occurring over a known probability distribution ) , imperfect information ( some information is hidden from each player ) , and partially observable outcomes ( some information might never be known ) .
Consequently , the use of deception , opponent modeling , and coping with uncertainty are indispensable elements of high - level strategic play .
Traditional methods for computer game - playing are incapable of handling these properties .
Writing a program to play a skillful game of poker is a challenging proposition from an engineering perspective as well , since each decision must be made quickly ( typically about one second ) .
A major theme of this dissertation is the evolution of architectures for poker - playing programs that has occurred since the research began in 1992 .
Four distinct approaches we address are : knowledge - based systems , simulation , game - theoretic methods , and adaptive imperfect information game - tree search .
Each phase of the research explored the strengths and weaknesses of the corresponding architectures , both in theory and in practice .
The important problem of obtaining an accurate assessment of performance is also addressed .
The creation of a powerful tool for this purpose , called DIVAT , is discussed in detail .
The academic papers arising from each of these studies constitute the core chapters of this thesis .
The conclusion discusses some of the advantages and shortcomings of each approach , along with the most valuable lessons learned in the process .
Although the goal of surpassing all human players has not yet been attained , the path has been cleared .
The best poker programs are beginning to pose a serious threat , even in this most ``human '' of games .
As programs continue to improve , they provide new insights into poker strategy , and valuable lessons on how to handle various forms of uncertainty .
On paper , Charles revealed himself in a way he rarely did in person .
He thought hard about what to say to a son who would have no memory of him .
Even if Jordan will never hear the cadence of his father ’s voice , he will know the wisdom of his words .
Image “ Follow your heart , ” Charles M. King wrote in a 200 - page journal for his son , Jordan , whom he first held this fall just weeks before he died in Iraq .
Credit ... Dana Canedy
Never be ashamed to cry .
No man is too good to get on his knee and humble himself to God .
Follow your heart and look for the strength of a woman .
Charles tried to anticipate questions in the years to come .
Favorite team ?
I am a diehard Cleveland Browns fan .
Favorite meal ?
Chicken , fried or baked , candied yams , collard greens and cornbread .
Childhood chores ?
Shoveling snow and cutting grass .
First kiss ?
Eighth grade .
In neat block letters , he wrote about faith and failure , heartache and hope .
He offered tips on how to behave on a date and where to hide money on vacation .
Rainy days have their pleasures , he noted : Every now and then you get lucky and catch a rainbow .
Charles mailed the book to me in July , after one of his soldiers was killed and he had recovered the body from a tank .
The journal was incomplete , but the horror of the young man ’s death shook Charles so deeply that he wanted to send it even though he had more to say .
He finished it when he came home on a two - week leave in August to meet Jordan , then 5 months old .
He was so intoxicated by love for his son that he barely slept , instead keeping vigil over the baby .
I can fill in some of the blanks left for Jordan about his father .
When we met in my hometown of Radcliff , Ky. , near Fort Knox , I did not consider Charles my type at first .
He was bashful , a homebody and got his news from television rather than newspapers ( heresy , since I ’m a New York Times editor ) .
But he won me over .
One day a couple of years ago , I pulled out a list of the traits I wanted in a husband and realized that Charles had almost all of them .
He rose early to begin each day with prayers and a list of goals that he ticked off as he accomplished them .
He was meticulous , even insisting on doing my ironing because he deemed my wrinkle - removing skills deficient .
His rock - hard warrior ’s body made him appear tough , but he had a tender heart .
My employer , Finetix , added my blog to their main feed and my most recent post at the time just happened to be about Star Wars , so I thought I needed to put up my first " Grown Up " post of the year .
Before you read on , I am assuming some reader familiarity with the ideas of loose coupling , cohesive code , and encapsulation .
Continuing where I left off from On Writing Maintainable Code , it 's time to talk about how to write code with a high degree of Orthogonality .
Applied to software design , Orthogonality is the ability to change a conceptual part of the software system while minimizing impact to other parts of the software system .
An orthogonal design separates different concerns of the system ( data access , security , business logic ) in a way that enables changes to be made in isolated areas of the code without rippling out .
Over time , and even within the originating project , software systems will need to accommodate changes to both their behavior and infrastructure .
Later in the lifecycle , old dog software systems will need to learn new tricks for unforeseen requirements as the business environment changes .
Also , you stand a much higher chance of being able to reuse your existing code to perform this new functionality with a system that has been decomposed into orthogonal pieces .
My favorite analogy for orthogonal code is the Lego sets you had as a child .
You can use a small Lego brick to build almost anything .
A big piece shaped like a pirate ship can only be used to make a pirate ship .
The basic concepts for writing Orthogonal code are loose coupling and high cohesion .
These concepts are well known , but far too often ignored or not entirely appreciated .
Several years ago several of my " Architect " colleagues spent a week at an OOP bootcamp .
For the next couple weeks " Loosely Coupled " was worked into every single conversation that we had .
Two weeks after that they went back to designing web services that took SQL strings in their input messages and stuffing business logic into stored procedures .
I think they largely missed the point .
You 've heard the mantra your entire software development career , as epitomized by this quote from Scott Bellware :
Loosely - coupled , highly - cohesive , ya - da , ya - da , ya - da , blah , blah , blah – the [ developer 's ] eyes roll back into his head and the archi-speak fades into a nice , lulling drone .
Focus those eyes back to the front of your head and pay attention , because orthogonal code , maintainable code , testable code , understandable code — all of these goals are most likely accomplished by a strong focus on loose coupling and high cohesion resting on the bedrock of Encapsulation .
Achieve better cohesion by paying attention to " Tell , Don't Ask , " the Law of Demeter , and the Single Responsibility Principle .
Supercharge the loose coupling of your code by applying the Dependency Inversion Principle and the Open / Closed Principle .
Get some testability into your code .
Do n't write this post off as just academic hot air , this is about consistently leaving the office on time and protecting your company 's code assets because you 'll be much more likely to smoothly sustain a forward progress with your existing code .
Real World Example
To gain an appreciation for orthogonal code , or the lack thereof , let 's look at some poorly designed code that does not exhibit orthogonality .
This is n't completely a contrived example either , this is largely taken and exaggerated from a preliminary version of a system that I later inherited .
I chose this example because this code was hard to change , and major changes and extensions were necessary in its first year of life .
Unfortunately , I 've commonly run across code like this in my career .
Microsoft developers get a bad rap for having an inadequate command of good development principles and practices , but I 've seen this type of tightly coupled , uncohesive code in several different programming languages , environments , and organizations .
Here 's the scenario , the architecture is a Pipes and Filters structure that involves a series of message processors that take an Xml input , interpret that data and perform business validations and / or transform the input message to an outgoing message , and then put a serialized copy of the outgoing message onto an MSMQ queue .
The entry point method of one of the " Filter " classes looked like this :
public void Transform ( InputMessage input ) { // BusinessLogicClass needs some reference data before it can do the transform // Use a derivation of the original Data Access Application Block from MS // First , gotta look up the connection string first string connectionString = ConfigurationManager .ConnectionStrings [ " ReferenceData " ] .ConnectionString ; DataSet dataSet = SqlHelper.ExecuteDataSet ( " select * from sometable where some_field = some_property_of_input " , connectionString ) ; // do a bunch of business logic processing to transform Input to Output .
It 's not shown here , but // the processMessage ( ) function has calls to the data access classes interjected into the OutputMessage outputMessage = this.processMessage( input , dataSet ) ; // then send the message on via MSMQ // Look up the Queue name first string queueName = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings[" BusinessLogicClassQueue " ] if (!MessageQueue.Exists ( queueName ) ) { MessageQueue.Create ( queueName , true ) ; } MessageQueue queue = new MessageQueue ( queueName ) ; string serialized Output = serializeOutgoingMessage( outputMessage ) queue.
Send(serializedOutput ) ; }
Fine , that code was easy to write in the first pass , but how about easy to change ?
To understand ?
To extend ?
To test ?
In reality this code is probably several times bigger because I omitted quite a bit of try / catch logic around the data access and queue management .
Not to mention that the actual business validation and transformation rules were complex .
We can easily spot some significant problems with this code as wewalk through some of the possible changes to this code base .
Let 's talk about why a change could be difficult , and then in the sections below examine the application of orthogonal design principles to make these changes less painful .
Change the queueing mechanism .
Originally the system communicated between the logical filter classes running in multiple windows service processes by putting the outgoing Xml message into an MSMQ queue .
Reflecting this choice , our Transform ( ) method directly uses the classes in the System .
Messaging to talk to MSMQ .
Change configuration mechanisms .
This method pulls its own configuration straight from the application config file .
If the application needs some more sophisticated configuration infrastructure , this code , and every other piece of code ,
Change the database structure .
Ok , it 's the year 2007 , and in the post ASP classic world we do n't embed sql directly in our business logic code anymore , but sometimes it 's good to remember why we follow good design principles .
Changing the database structure could easily break the business logic .
Just as importantly , writing the business logic was harder than it had to be because you had to slog through the data access machinery along the way .
Even if the database structure does n't change , you might want to take advantage of some sort of caching mechanism .
If you do n't have an encapsulated data access library , you might end up needlessly repeating a large amount of boilerplate code around connection management ( get connection string , open connection , attach transaction object , try / catch / finally exception handling ) .
Change the business logic .
Let 's call this one a near certitude .
As I 'll show later , reusing the business logic while leaving the database and messaging queue behind may be the important change that has to be made later .
may be the important change that has to be made later .
Implement better ( any ) auditing or security .
Where would you put the security and auditing ?
Everything seems to be jumbled together here .
Encapsulation
I 've often heard encapsulation described as " shy " code .
Putting it another way , a lack of encapsulation is code walking around with its underwear on the outside .
Classes that conceal their inner workings are easier to use .
You do n't have to do nearly as much hand holding with encapsulated classes because they know how to bootstrap themselves .
For a contrast in encapsulation , let 's take a look at how the Filter .
Transform ( ) method performs its data access .
The original system used a modified copy of the original Data Access Application Block ( DAAB ) class .
The DAAB was an attempt to simplify data access by encapsulating some very common ADO .
Net grunt work inside one monster sized class called SqlHelper .
The DAAB was popular , but I always thought it was lacking , mostly because it did not provide enough encapsulation of ADO .
Net to form the core of a solid Data Access Layer .
Let 's look at the signature of two of the most commonly used methods on the SqlHelper , then let 's talk about where the DAAB just did n't go far enough .
public static int ExecuteNonQuery ( string connectionString , CommandType commandType , string commandText )
public static int ExecuteNonQuery ( SqlTransaction transaction , CommandType commandType , string commandText )
That 's not so terrible , and it does , after all , encapsulate the creation and manipulation of SqlCommand and exception handling .
Take a look at what you * do* have to tell SqlHelper .
You have to go look up the connection string separately every single time .
If you need to do transactional sql statements ( and you do ) , you 're going to have to keep the SqlTransaction object around yourself and remember to pass it into the ExecuteNonQuery ( ) overload method on every single call .
You also have to keep telling the SqlHelper what type of command you 're using .
In the real life example system , that led to an absurd amount of repeated , noise code like this :
SqlHelper.ExecuteNonQuery( ConfigurationClass.GetConnectionString( ) , CommandType .
Text , " some sql statement " ) ;
Why should I have to tell my Data Access Layer ( DAL ) what it 's database connection string is ?
What possible value is it to me to have to specify CommandType .
Text repeatedly if that 's the only CommandType I care about ?
If I 'm using transactions , I have to know about the Transaction class and shuttle it around between calls .
In my opinion , the DAAB simply did not provide enough value .
At most it was simply something that you could wrap further or use as sample code to write your own — and that 's exactly what I did .
When I do have to use a classical DAL , I use a homegrown assembly that encapsulates all of my ADO .
Net manipulation , mostly behind this core interface :
public interface IDataSession { … void BeginTransaction ( ) ; void CommitTransaction ( ) ; void RollbackTransaction ( ) ; int ExecuteCommand ( IDbCommand command ) ; int ExecuteSql( string sql ) ; … }
The major advantage over something like DAAB is far more encapsulation of the underlying ADO .
Net objects .
Using this interface as my core , I can concentrate solely on the sql being used inside my DAL instead of so much tedious ADO .
Net code .
Consumers of the IDataSession interface do n't have to know how to fetch the connection string or store a Transaction class somewhere because those details are encapsulated within the concrete implementations of IDataSession .
In case you 're curious , and you have far too much time on your hands , my homegrown DAL assembly is now part of the StructureMap code , but you 'll have to pull it down out of the Subversion trunk ( http://sourceforge.net/projects/structuremap).
Given a choice I 'll use NHibernate for persistence instead , but I still use StructureMap .
DataAccess for test automation and utility code .
I have not looked at the descendent version of the DAAB in the Enterprise Library , but I would have to assume that it 's much improved from the DAAB .
Tell , Do n't Ask
One way to detect or prevent leakages in encapsulation is to follow the Tell , Do n't Ask principle .
… you should endeavor to tell objects what you want them to do ; do not ask them questions about their state , make a decision , and then tell them what to do .
Here 's an example violation of Tell , Do n't Ask :
public void SelectAPointByAskingDetails ( DataPointSelector selector ) { // ask DataPointSelector for all of its internal Point's Point [ ] points = selector .
AllPoints ; // ask DataPointSelector what it 's SelectionType is , // then , depending on the SelectionType , pick the // Point out of the Point array and set the SelectedPoint // property on DataPointSelector switch ( selector.SelectionType ) { case SelectionType .
First : selector .
SelectedPoint = points [ 0 ] ; break ; case SelectionType .
Minumum : // loop through all the points and // find the " minimum " point , whatever that means break ; } }
This " Asking " method knows a lot about the DataPointSelector , and it 's making all of the decisions for DataPointSelector .
Following Tell , Do n't Ask would lead us to encapsulate the details of Point selection into DataPointSelector .
After the encapsulation , the interaction with DataPointSelector is now :
public void SelectAPointByTelling ( DataPointSelector selector ) { selector .
SelectPoint ( ) ; }
" Pragmatic " Andy Hunt explains " Tell , Don't Ask " very will in an episode of DotNetRocks .
You Will Follow the Law of Demeter !
I 've always wanted to use that for a blog title , but I really do n't think I can improve on the Wikipedia article on the Law of Demeter .
I mention it here because it's an important tool for increasing encapsulation in your code .
Roughly , following the Law of Demeter increases encapsulation by avoiding long messaging chains like TopClass .
Child.Helper.Connection .Close ( ) .
Instead , open up a new Close ( ) method on the TopClass and hide the entire chain of calls through its children .
It 's nothing but making sure that TopClass is wearing its underwear ( Child. Helper.etc ) under its clothes where it belongs .
High Cohesion
Code that is highly cohesive groups strongly related code into a common class , namespace , or module .
On the flipside , a highly cohesive class is one that has narrowly focused responsibilities .
Code with low cohesion either scatters related code throughout the system , or leads to classes with unrelated responsibilities .
High Cohesion leads to code that is easier to understand , reduces duplication , enhances reusability , and generally makes code easier to maintain .
The Filter class flunks a test of cohesion , and also implies some greater problems throughout the codebase .
To start fixing the Filter class , let 's list the responsibilities of the Filter class .
Fetching configuration
Calling the database to get some reference data
Performs the business validation and transformation logic
Serializes the results into Xml
Creates the messaging queue if it does not already exist
Sends the output message to the outgoing messaging queue
Wait , you say .
The Filter class is probably the implementation of a single use case or story .
That 's cohesive right ?
Well , no , because even inside this single use case there 's a mixture of business logic and system infrastructure .
Chances are very good that you will want to reuse pieces of the infrastructural code outside of this single use case .
Maybe more importantly , you want to avoid duplicating system infrastructure code so that you can accommodate changes in infrastructure more readily .
Let 's take the immediate refactoring step of moving the messaging infrastructure code into a separate class and simply let Filter delegate to this new class .
public class MessagingGateway { public void SendMessage ( OutputMessage outputMessage ) { //
Look up the Queue name first string queueName = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings[" BusinessLogicClassQueue " ] ; if (!MessageQueue.Exists ( queueName ) ) { MessageQueue.Create ( queueName , true ) ; } MessageQueue queue = new MessageQueue ( queueName ) ; string serialized Output = serializeOutgoingMessage ( outputMessage ) ; queue .
Send( serializedOutput ) ; } private string serializeOutgoing Message( OutputMessage message ) { return null ; } }
Now we 've gotten the details of the messaging infrastructure away from the rest of the flow of the Filter code in a class ( MessagingGateway ) that can be reused across multiple Filter classes .
If we wanted or needed to , we could change the serialization to a binary format , use a different security mechanism on the queues , easily add more auditing , or maybe switch to an entirely different technology .
Switching gears entirely , maybe you want to throw out the idea of queueing and run all of the Filter 's in a single common AppDomain .
Assuming that any new version of MessagingGateway encapsulates the details of its implementation , every single one of these changes could take place without altering the code in the Filter classes .
That 's orthogonality at it 's best .
While doing research for this section I came across this great article from Meilir Page - Jones on Cohesion .
It 's from an introductory textbook on Structured Programming of all things , but it 's readily applicable to today 's OOP and I would think SOA paradigms .
Single Responsibility Principle
We improved the cohesion of the original Filter class by extracting out a class for MessagingGateway , but there are still unrelated responsibilities left in the Filter .
Transform ( ) method that could be pulled out .
The new MessagingGateway class itself could use some improvement .
So how many responsibilities can a class take on before cohesion is compromised ?
Exactly one , and that 's known as the Single Responsibility Principle .
A class should have only one reason to change .
Taking a closer look at the new MessagingGateway above , we see at least two reasons it may have to change .
The queueing itself obviously , but it MessagingGateway also pulls the address of the queue from the configuration file .
It 's very conceivable that the configuration strategy of an application could change to something more sophisticated .
Specifically , I can remember a project where we could have collapsed 75 servers , all of which were a single point of failure , into 12 - 14 redundant servers , except that the configuration code was scattered throughout the application instead of being encapsulated into a cohesive module of the system .
Intermingling the code that retrieved configuration data with the rest of the system effectively eliminated a chance to remove a huge amount of support overhead while actually increasing uptime .
Off the top of my head , I can think of two ways to remove the details of the configuration storage from the MessagingGateway class .
My strong preference is to simply poke in the queue name and whatever else configuration that the MessagingGateway needs into its constructor function ( using StructureMap of course ! ) .
The other way , just to avoid branching off into a discussion on IoC / DI tools or builder classes , is to pull the access to the configuration into a centralized class .
That class , and the new slightly simpler MessagingGateway , might look a bit like this :
public class ConfigurationManager { public static string ConnectionString { get { return " something " ; } } … } public class MessagingGateway { public void SendMessage ( OutputMessage outputMessage ) { //
Look up the Queue name first string queueName = ConfigurationManager.QueueName ; … } }
Taking the Single Responsibility Principle knife to our original Filter .
Transform ( ) method leads to pushing some of the responsibilities out into these new classes :
public class DataAccessObjectForTheFilterClass { public ReferenceData GetReferenceData( InputMessage input ) { // go grab the connection string , call some sort of sql , // and put the data into some sort of usable data structure … } } public class BusinessValidationAndTransformationProcessor { public OutputMessage ProcessValidations ( InputMessage message , ReferenceData referenceData ) { // do a lot of business processing here , but only business processing … } }
The new version of the Filter .
Transform ( ) method delegates to the new granular , cohesive classes :
public void Transform ( InputMessage input ) { //
Get the reference data DataAccessObjectForTheFilterClass dao = new DataAccessObjectForTheFilterClass ( ) ; ReferenceData referenceData = dao.GetReferenceData( input ) ; //
Do the validation and transformation BusinessValidationAndTransformationProcessor processor = new BusinessValidationAndTransformationProcessor ( ) ; OutputMessage outputMessage = processor.ProcessValidations ( input , referenceData ) ; //
Send out the outgoing message MessagingGateway messagingGateway = new MessagingGateway ( ) ; messagingGateway.SendMessage( outputMessage ) ; }
We pulled out the responsibility for configuration , data access , business validation , and the messaging infrastructure out of the main Filter class into cohesive classes .
At this point , the Filter class is merely a " Coordinator " stereotype from Responsibility Driven Design .
Centralizing the coordination of the various pieces into a dedicated coordinator is a great way to enhance the orthogonality of the code .
One of the client developers on my team asked me how do you know when you need to create a new class rather than add functionality to an existing class .
I responded with " One class , one responsibility . "
That leads us into a question of just what * is* a responsibility .
My advice is to look for pieces of a class that do n't seem to be related to the rest of the class and pull it out .
I think the class being discussed that day was the Application Controller class that manages the basic shell of our WinForms application .
Part of the UI is a panel of tabs for individual active views .
Our ApplicationController class was starting to collect quite a few methods around managing the contents of the TabControl that were n't related to the rest of the ApplicationController .
We pulled the functionality for managing the active view collection and the TabControl into a separate controller / view combination .
Instead of one really big schizophrenic controller class , we had two smaller controller classes , both with a focused intent .
There 's a very important lesson in that .
Many times you 'll find that more classes lead to a simpler design by minimizing the complexity of any one single class .
Loose Coupling
Back to the original Filter .
Tranform ( ) method , the business logic in the Filter class is tightly bound to the configuration of the system , the messaging infrastructure , and knows directly about the SQL that gets passed into SqlHelper .
In this design , the business logic inside of Filter is coupled very tightly to the infrastructure .
So what does that really mean ?
Just to see if someone is reading my blog , here 's another real world scenario .
Let 's say you built your core software system 5 - 6 years ago before any of the Object / Relational Mapping persistance tools were considered mature .
To fill the gap you wrote your own proprietary ORM and everything is great — for awhile .
Fast forward to today and you realize that Hibernate or the forthcoming LINQ tools are significantly easier to use and have some functionality that you would like to have that is n't readily possible with your own homegrown ORM tool .
If your business logic , user interface , and service layer are tightly coupled to your homegrown ORM , changing to another tool may not be economical .
If you interspersed too much of the persistence code with the business logic or service layer code , you 're effectively looking at a rewrite just to use the better tool .
That 's not the end of the world , but you 've just incurred an inefficiency that your competitors might not have by using the better tools .
You may absolutely not interpret this as a license to go build extra or unnecessary layers of abstraction on top of your persistence layer .
When I use NHibernate I do encapsulate it behind thin wrapper interfaces , but anything beyond that might be getting into the realm of silly .
Ted Neward recently skewered some folks for too many abstraction layers .
All I want to say here is to keep as much distance between your persistence and business logic code as you possibly can .
I 've talked quite a bit about the coupling between the business logic and persistence code , but tight coupling might be lurking in a lot more corners of your system .
In the implementation of a web service or any other integration point , strongly coupling the functionality of that service to the transport mechanism or Xml format often turns out to have negative effects .
To the SOA enthusiasts of the world , I say to you that loose coupling does n't stop once you 're underneath the initial SOAP message .
Loose coupling is just as important , in the small , in the code within a service .
Singleton 's or static classes are a very strong form of coupling
Calls within a class to the constructor of another class is a subtle form of strong coupling
Dependency Inversion Principle
Wait !
You just said that a call to a constructor is a form of tight coupling ?
How ?
When we last left the Filter .
Transform ( ) method we had decomposed the responsibilities of the original scenario into cohesive classes , but the Filter class is creating the concrete helper classes directly .
MessagingGateway messagingGateway = new MessagingGateway ( ) ; messagingGateway.
SendMessage( outputMessage ) ;
In the code above , Filter knows exactly the class that performs the messaging , and it 's dependent upon that MessagingGateway .
We 've moved all of the details around interacting with MSMQ into MessagingGateway , so we could change the transport layer without modifying Filter , but what if we really do need to use Filter both with MSMQ and a web services transport layer ?
Simple , let 's apply the Dependency Inversion Principle and extract out an interface for MessagingGateway that is independent on any of the concrete implementations of messaging transport .
The second step is to make Filter depend on the abstracted interface .
You do have to have a way to get the different implementations of IMessagingGateway into Filter , so we use just pass an instance of IMessagingGateway into Filter ( Constructor Injection ) .
public interface IMessagingGateway { void SendMessage ( OutputMessage outputMessage ) ; } public class MessagingGateway : IMessagingGateway
public class Filter { private readonly IMessagingGateway _messagingGateway ; // Push in the IMessagingGateway in the constructor function // so Filter does n't even have to know which concrete // class is in here public Filter ( IMessagingGateway messagingGateway ) { _messagingGateway = messagingGateway ; } public void Transform ( InputMessage input ) { //
Do the things that Filter . Transform ( ) does … _messagingGateway.SendMessage( outputMessage ) ; } }
Now , we 've got Filter receiving an abstracted IMessagingGateway from somewhere else , so it could work with completely different types of messaging infrastructure — or even work with no messaging .
Do n't just stop with the messaging either , abstract away the data access and the business validation and transformation code as well .
Open / Closed Principle
We 've busted the original Filter .
Transform ( ) method into smaller cohesive pieces , and decreased the coupling between the pieces by extracting out abstracted interfaces .
Now we can talk about the ultimate principle for creating maintainable code — the Open / Closed Principle ( OCP ) ..
Verbatim , this principle is stated " Software entities ( classes , modules , functions , etc. ) should be open for extension , but closed for modification . "
I used to think this only referred to the practice of creating plugin extensibility points in your code , but that 's only part of the OCP story .
What I 've learned since then is that the essence of the Open / Closed Principle is being able to add new functionality to an existing codebase by writing completely new code with minimal modification of existing code .
One of the major costs of extending an existing system is the potential for regression bugs in existing functionality .
The most reliable way to minimize the creation of regression bugs is to avoid modifying the existing code .
I " ve consistently observed that I 'm always faster when I 'm building all new code versus making modifications in existing code .
I 've found that the OCP pattern is going to emerge in two basic ways :
" Pluggability . "
This is the obvious usage , but maybe not the most effective .
By " pluggability " I really just mean the ability to create a new class or group of classes to implement a new feature and make only minimal changes to the existing code to call into the new code .
For example , we can create new functionality in Filter .
Transform ( ) by injecting in all new implementations of IMessagingGateway .
If we 've abstracted the business rules , we can even change strictly the business rules by creating a new class and simply passing it in at the proper place .
Following the OCP does n't have to mean the full - blown ideal of runtime plugins ( shameless plug : Dependency Injection tools like StructureMap make this much easier and more reliable ; ) ) .
The second , and possibly more powerful OCP usage , is recombining existing classes or components to create new functionality .
In the real world system behind my Filter .
Transform ( ) example , we had a need in a later project to use the transformation logic completely independent of the pipes and filters architecture in a brand new web service .
If the transformation logic is decoupled from the rest of the Filter .
Transform ( ) method , we can simply take that cohesive business validation class and use it in the entirely new context .
In real life that functionality was very strongly coupled to the pipes and filters architecture and I spent several days doing refactoring just to expose that functionality .
Think of this scenario as well from my new career in financial applications .
Say you have an analysis engine inside your web application that pulls its transactional data from a database and it works great for quite awhile .
Then one day your CEO comes in and says that they have a great opportunity if you can only mate the existing analysis engine to data entered into an Excel sheet so a trader can run simulations .
Can you do that ?
If the analytic engine makes a lot of " pull " calls to the data access layer , or is tightly coupled in some other way to the database , you might miss out on that opportunity .
On the other hand , if in your existing architecture you simply " push " all of the data into the analytics engine that it needs , it 's going to be relatively easy to take the cohesive analytics engine and use it in a completely new context .
Testability
A while back , Scott Bellware vociferously wrote that there is no sustainability without testability ( and by inference , automated tests ) .
I could not agree more .
Part of modifying existing code is verifying both the correctness of the new code and regression testing the old code to prevent regression bugs .
Regression testing is a major cost and a significant risk to modifying existing software .
A high degree of test automation can alleviate these concerns , but an effective and efficient test automation strategy is only enabled by a good design — specifically an orthogonal structure that enables opportunities for focused whitebox testing .
There was a good discussion on the Test Driven Development group on Yahoo about the relationship between Testability and good design .
The discussion was kicked off by someone asking if there really was a linkage between testability and good design ?
I emphatically believe that designs that are not testable are bad designs .
I 'm not sure whether or not I 'd say that testability is a first class goal in design , or simply a vital means towards making working code .
Regardless , testability alone is enough of a reason to strive for orthogonal code structures .
Code that is easy to test is easy to make work .
Testability largely coincides happily with the principles of the good design you were striving for anyway : loose coupling and high cohesion .
Automated testing is much simpler when it's easy to isolate functionality ( loose coupling ) and when you can test one small thing at a time ( cohesion ) .
One of the very significant values of using Test Driven Development is that the technique is very effective at sniffing out coupling or cohesion problems .
When it 's hard to write the unit tests , it 's usually indicative of low cohesion or tight coupling .
Putting it All Together
Alright , we know some of the principles of writing orthogonal code and we 've taken a long look at the coupling and cohesion issues around a sample system .
As I said earlier , my sample scenario was from a real project I was part of two years ago .
Do your best Keith Jackson imitation here — in that real world system , the original team hit the " Granddaddy of Them All " —
The Great Refactoring of Aught Five .
The pipes and filters architecture was killing them with complexity .
The code was slow , hard to deploy , difficult to troubleshoot , and nasty to test .
I do n't remember how long it took , but they stopped and ripped out some of the pipes and filters support to collapse the application into a single AppDomain .
Performance went up , deployment got easier , and testing and troubleshooting improved somewhat .
All the same though , I would call the Great Refactoring a mild failure because it could have been done more efficiently and left the code in a better state .
They did n't completely remove the pipes and filter motiff , largely because refactoring any farther would have been too difficult because the code was not orthogonal .
The time spent doing the Great Refactoring was pure overhead , because not a single bit of business functionality was added .
I say overhead because the refactoring could have been several times easier and quicker if they had religiously followed orthogonal design concepts from the very beginning .
With an orthogonal structure they could have thrown away the messaging infrastructure and the filter coordination code away , but reused the business logic and data access classes largely unchanged .
If the refactoring had been less risky , and orthogonal code would have mitigated the risk , they might have eased the refactoring by simply starting it early instead of waiting until they were backed into a corner .
Lastly , on the Pipes and Filters Scenario
I apologize to the original team for doing this at their expense , but they provided a near perfect object lesson on a couple fronts and I bet they 'd agree with many of my conclusions two years later .
The original impetus for using the Pipes and Filters architecture being spread across multiple windows services was to be able to scale the system " vertically " across multiple systems .
From my perspective , the project was jeopardized by committing far too early to a complex design upfront without any significant deviation or adaptation until things got really bad .
The entire skeleton of the system was layed out before doing any significant testing or even unit testing .
A large impetus for the XP YAGNI ideal is that it 's considerably easier to start simple and add complexity as needed than it is to eliminate or change unnecessary complexity .
I think that building good systems is very largely dependent upon getting feedback and verification on your design early and often and then using those lessons .
Some of the team was used to heavy RUP style upfront design instead of an adaptive approach .
They dumped the UML , but did n't replace it with an adaptive design approach .
UML or not , pay attention to your design so you know when you 're going off the rails .
Another lesson that we * all * need to take away from this is to keep learning and get some exposure to new ideas and different ways of thinking .
Consciously or unconsciously , the team lead on the project chose the pipes and filters model because he had a deep background in mainframe applications and it was a comfortable style for him .
Even after the big refactoring the pipes and filter model left a lot of " noise " code in the system that made the flow of the code very , very difficult to follow and generally bloated the codebase .
I still think that a Domain Model +
Service Layer organization would have been much more suitable and far simpler .
This development motto from Bil Simser captures the myopia towards the comfortable for me :
" If all you do is what you know , you 'll never grow . "
The pipes and filters architecture included a lot of support for metadata driven composition of the filters along the way to make the addition of new workflows easier through configuration .
In reality the extra metadata - driven pipeline infrastructure just turned into a great deal of intellectual overhead in understanding and troubleshooting the system .
When it came time to build new functionality into the system , we struggled to reuse existing functionality because it was too tightly coupled to the pipeline extensibility mechanism .
Ironically , I felt that one of the biggest impediments to adding a new workflow to the system was the very extensibility mechanism put into the code for new workflows .
Wait , there 's more …
I 've got much more to say on writing maintainable code in this ongoing series , but it 's going to wait awhile .
I 'm all blogged out for now .
Jeremy Rose : Barcelona ’s Christmas Crapper Canned
Barcelona ’s Christmas Crapper Canned
Story & Images By Jeremy Rose
Barcelona
Caganers ( literally shitters ) on sale outside the Sagrada Familia
The traditional Caganer – a figurine of a man taking a shit – that has been gracing nativity scenes in Catalonia since at least the 16th century has been omitted from Barcelona ’s official Christmas display this year because it was felt not to be in keeping with the city ’s attempts to clean itself up .
The city council – or Ajuntament – is expected to pass a controversial bylaw , on December 23 , which clamps down on everything from pissing in the street and skateboarding to busking and “ aggressive begging . ”
The local English language newspaper – Catalonia Today – has warned the bylaw could turn Barcelona into the “ Singapore of Europe ” and a group of academics has compared the bylaw to a Franco era law “ against socially dangerous people ” which allowed the police to lock up prostitutes , the homeless , gays and anyone else they deemed to be socially dangerous .
Whether the armless man who rattles a tin in his mouth outside El Corte Ingles - the city ’s flashest department store - will qualify as an “ aggressive beggar ” is yet to be seen .
However , the municipal police , perhaps in anticipation of the bylaw ’s introduction , have already moved to prevent a character known as the “ Maradona of the Ramblas ” from delighting the crowds with his football acrobatics .
And the police seem to have effectively rid the city in recent weeks of the hundreds of illegal streets sellers who used to sell everything from pirated CDs and fake designer sunglasses to African and South American trinkets on the main tourist thoroughfares .
Police having a word with a street performer and his dog
Despite its absence from the official nativity scene Caganers are everywhere .
Nativity scenes in shop windows invariably include the figure squatting just outside the manger and Christmas stalls surrounding the Sagrada Familia and the city ’s cathedral are overflowing with them .
George Bush Caganer
Most the figurines are the traditional Catalan cloth - capped figure squatting over a caca ( shit ) but inevitably perhaps there ’s also a squatting George W Bush clutching a globe in his hands and in a creative combining of Catalan traditions a castell – or human tower – with the anchorman taking a dump .
Catalan traditions combined : Caganers take on the anchorman role in traditional human towers
And in a 21st Century update of the Caganer tradition , a Catalan television channel has animated a piss - take of King Kong that includes flying Caganers shitting on a giant ape clinging to the city ’s landmark telecommunications tower .
A variety of Caganers remains on sale

What is a Computer Science Degree good for ?
When I was going to school at MIT about 15 years ago , it seemed to me that most of the people getting computer science degrees and excelling in them were people deeply entrenched in the mathematical concepts of programming such as recursion , pointers , iterative styles , parallel and threading theory .
Now whether it was MIT 's intent or not , a computer science degree from MIT got you well - primed for doing things like creating your own programming language , solving hard optimization problems such as grid computing , defining your own GUI system , AI and the like , and in fact a lot of people I knew who graduated with MIT computer science degrees did exactly that .
Computer Science was not something you took to simply learn how to program .
You took Civil Engineering for that .
Ironically the class at MIT that taught you C- Programming was offered by the Civil Engineering department , not the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science department .
In Joel Spolsky 's article The Perils of JavaSchools , I sensed a bit of snobbery in his comments .
" I 've seen all kinds of figures for drop - out rates in CS and they 're usually between 40 % and 70 % .
The universities tend to see this as a waste ; I think it 's just a necessary culling of the people who are n't going to be happy or successful in programming careers . "
Do you really need a computer science degree to be successful in a programming career ,
should all programming courses be geared for computer science majors ?
My first thought , when reading that was , and secondly ,
I took 6.001 ( and survived :) , the Introductory Comp Sci class at MIT that Joel claims should be what all intro comp classes should be like .
I chose to major in Mechanical Engineering , not because I did n't want to be a programmer , but because I did not want to solve Grid theory problems which it seemed that was what an MIT Computer Science education was good for .
I was instead interested in the mundane questions of life and wanted the fastest road to get there .
Solving problems that would simply bore my MIT Comp Sci counterparts to death really peeked my interest .
I was more concerned about building my ping pong game to play with than the poke and peek code I needed to write to get there .
While I marveled at my genius to write such a tight piece of code at such a young age , it was more out of necessity than to create a piece of artwork to be admired .
My related observation was that as a Mechanical Engineering graduate , I could easily become a programmer that the masses needed , and in fact already was , but as a CS major I could not so easily migrate to Mechanical Engineering and the like .
I suspect there are a lot of universities out there whose main purpose is to churn out fairly competent programmers , and then there are some who strive to do a little more than that , such as MIT .
So what is a computer science degree good for depends on which university you come from .
I tend to think that MIT has the right idea about a computer science education and that the more common programming problems of life should be left to other majors .
Programming as we know it is changing .
It is becoming more specialized , and it really has very little to do with the tenets of computer science .
Do Computer Science Majors make better Programmers ?
There are basically two kinds of programming - programming designed to solve computer science problems such as how do you work in 1/ n time or create a system that makes it possible to write 1/10th the code to achieve 10 times what you had before , and then there are the other problems that you try to solve once you 've got this speed and efficiency ; how best to put all this power and efficiency to good use .
The second is what I will refer to as business programming .
Programming has changed a lot in the past 10 years .
In order to produce a fairly competent piece of business software , it is no longer necessary to know the intricacies of recursion and pointers or how the bits and bytes harmonize .
While it 's handy to know these things , it is not the be and end all .
People also expect more for their efforts .
For example when we talk about a string , we do n't need to know that a string is implemented as an array of characters with the first element being defined as the address of the string or know the difference between big-endian and little - endian .
These are computer science problems , not something that your general business programmer will run into on a day to day basis .
Such minutiae while interesting are so abstracted away from general life that they have little relevance .
Instead just general problem solving is of high - priority .
Componentization has also reached an unimagined level .
I do n't need to know how to build a report writer ; I just need to know how to integrate it with my problem domain .
For what I call Business Programming - the day to day nuts and bolts that make business work and give business advantage , it is important to have a good foundation in your choice of domains .
Domains are wide and varied - such as statistics , finance , mechanics , database optimization , network theory , airline industry , molecular biology , environmental planning and the like .
Some cross into the realms of computer science and computer engineering , but many do not .
Domain knowledge is almost as hard and sometimes harder to acquire as is a good foundation in computer science .
So when you have a complex domain such as life insurance , statistics , and biology you tend to value a person 's domain knowledge just as much as or if not more than their programming prowess .
Before it was much easier to explain domain knowledge to a computer scientist than it was for a computer scientist to explain programming to a domain expert .
Now especially with engineering fields and mathematical fields , that is no longer the case .
This is because engineering disciplines already provide a good problem - solving background and programming with all its added abstractions is becoming closer and closer to pure problem - solving with black - boxed components .
In fact we are beginning to see a renewed interest in domain specific languages ( DSL ) or what some call mini-languages .
Domain specific languages are highly optimized for a specific domain because they use the short - hand lingo intrinsic to that domain .
For example you have SQL designed specifically for database problems , Html for web , R for statistical problems , various macro languages to solve graphical problems , gis mapping problems and the like .
As a Mechanical Engineering major I did a lot of programming and my thesis was in fact a computer program , but it was highly - focused in systems control theory concepts that a general computer science major would not be privy to and would be hard to explain to anyone who had not taken a control theory course .
So if you need to build a new OS or DBMS or solve grid - computing problems , hire a computer scientist .
If your needs are more mundane as are most , think twice .
From my experience pure computer science majors get bored when they can not debate about this OO model over that or the merits of this language over that and have to deal with general user needs .
While having a foundation in computer programming and general computer problem solving skills is still important , one does not need to major in computer science to get that and god for bid if all programming classes look like 6.001 .
In fact most of what you learn is not in school , because while tools are becoming easier to use , there are also a lot more of them to know about and learn .
Look around and you 'll see that a large number of people who consider themselves programmers and are very good programmers were not computer science majors .

Wow ...
The Pompeii one is really amazing .
Somehow seeing it in documentaries on TV just does n't show you how really huge the site is ...

Awesome .
See where those people are standing high up back on the reykjavik one ?
I stood there and peered in as the light failed , and took a miserable attempt of a photograph .

Iterative delivery is bringing software production very close to monthly magazine publishing .
Although being on time and without problems cannot be attributed to most software releases , good magazines maintain quality and produce great issues month after month .
What can we take from magazine publishing to improve software releases ?
I spent two years as editor - in - chief of Mikro ( PC World edition for Serbia ) .
Relja Jovic ( then executive editor , now editor - in - chief ) and I significantly improved the production process , leading the magazine out of constant fire - fighting and staff burnout into a stable production rhythm .
While most of our competitors were sinking in the recession , we improved - in a year , our magazine became the market leader , nearly doubling the circulation .
We achieved this by applying quite a few tricks and principles from agile software development , because magazine publishing looks strangely similar to a software shop .
If those two industries are based on similar principles , and I think that they are becoming more and more similar , how come that it is normal for magazines to be on time , but at the same time nobody is really surprised when software is late ?
I think that the missing link between iterative software projects and publishing is mostly in the perception of the delivery - the publishing approach can be used to make software deliveries much more reliable .
How can magazine publishing relate to software ?
I found a lot of similarities between publishing and software development - both software and magazines are , on the end , combined products of a diverse group of contributors working in parallel , on several threads , with similar resource and ‘ integration ’ issues .
Writers were for the magazine what programmers are in a typical software company - they produced the articles ( source ) which then had to be cleaned up ( unit - testing ) , put into a nice layout ( front - end GUI ) , assembled into a magazine ( integration , packaging ) , cleaned up again because of layout and spelling errors ( integration testing ) and published .
Pre-press and technical editors were our front - end developers and integrators , proof - readers were our testers .
Each magazine issue was a mix of big features and less important articles .
Some had to be published due to contractual obligations or timing - they were like high priority software updates .
Other articles could be postponed - they were like low - priority software features .
Some topics were small and could be finished in a single monthly cycle .
Others were quite big and took a few months to plan and prepare .
It ’s similar in the software world - some features are implemented over a few iterations , and some can be developed , packaged and delivered in the same iteration .
The money came in from two sides .
Readers are the equivalent of small individual software users , and advertisers are the equivalent of big corporate software users that pay a lot of money , but usually come with a list of demands .
We had to keep good relations with advertisers , so sometimes we had to cover hardware that no normal reader would be interested in , or events and conferences which our advertisers sponsored .
That is like a big customer demanding some obscure feature , or stopping you from throwing out a piece of legacy code which nobody else uses .
We experienced a lot of problems that are common in software production - articles taking too long to to finish , people getting sick or failing to complete assigned tasks on time , unavailable resources .
Our plans constantly changed to include last - minute wishes of sales and marketing .
Yet , every month we published a new issue ( delivered a new release , or iteration ) , never missing a deadline , with only minor problems ( production bugs ) getting through .
Though software is arguably faced with more complex challenges , reaching every milestone , always on time , without staff burnout , and with only minor production issues , is not an easy task .
I wish that I could achieve the same with my software projects .
Achieving predictability
Looking back , there were two major components to our success which I cannot find in most of my software experience : predictability and consistency .
Successful products are aligned with customers ’ expectations - when people get what they expected from a product , they are going to be satisfied , and will probably buy it again .
Mikro was published on 164 pages , on the first of each month .
Each issue had four to five big features , about twenty pages of news , thirty pages of hardware reviews , ten pages of software , ten pages of multimedia - related articles , and so on .
Note that this general structure does not imply what the big features were , nor which software and hardware products were reviewed - but the general structure was there .
No matter how hard I try , I cannot describe common features of my software releases in just two sentences with such consistency .
Readers and advertisers knew exactly what to expect , because we actively helped them to form those expectations .
Then , we met the expectations month after month - always trying to exceed them a bit , but not too much .
The predictability of our ‘ releases ’ allowed us to make realistic plans and had an excellent effect on customer relations - we never let our customers down .
Predictability could be reached easier then with software because there were less ‘ unknowns ’ .
Software projects are mostly a compromise between four factors : quality , cost , time and scope .
For the magazine , time and scope were fixed : it was published on specified dates , and had a fixed number of pages .
We had a very strict ‘ delivery ’ slot .
It was not just marketing , and living up to expectations that the magazine will be in the mailbox on the first of the month .
I think that our readers and advertisers could forgive us for being late a day or two .
The biggest problem was printing - there were just two companies in the country which could meet our printing requirements , and their services were booked several months in advance .
If we missed our printing slot by more than a few hours , the issue simply could not be published - and all our efforts would be pointless .
Imagine that as a deadline for your software project .
Though this constraint might seem like a big obstacle , it really helped the process a lot .
As we knew that we had strict ‘ release cycles ’ , we had realistic plans - much more realistic than those I see in software .
This does not mean that marketing did not push us to the limit with last minute changes , but everyone in the organisation knew that we could not afford to be late - so there were no unrealistic promises .
Although such hard time constraints are rare with software , I think that artificially imposing them could help a lot .
It would remove one variable from the project equation , and significantly reduce the complexity of the problem .
The customers would surely appreciate having predictable release dates , since they could make long term plans for upgrades .
I am sure that marketing and sales would love to have more predictability .
Most programmers would object at first , probably , but that is where the other constraint comes into the play .
In addition to knowing ‘ when ’ , we also knew ‘ how much ’ .
Each month , we had to publish 164 pages .
If there was no time to complete some articles , we moved them to the next issue , and threw in a few items that were easier to do .
But on the end , we had 164 pages .
The marketing could not demand that we publish 170 pages one month ( or 500 , which would be more likely if our magazine was software ) .
The programming equivalent of this constraint would be a fixed release scope .
This ‘ fixed scope ’ does not imply specific features , just the quantitative customer perception .
We had to deliver a fixed number of pages , in a generally defined structure , and that is what our readers and advertisers expected .
In order to reach the deadline , we chose a mix of hard and easy features for each issue .
Some were very important , some were there just to fill in the space .
It was crucial to make each issue interesting to both readers and advertisers , so we spread important features throughout the issues .
Iterative delivery in publishing works because customer expectations are consistently met on a quantitative level .
Hard repetitive deadlines and fixed scope reinforce each other : features are replaced to achieve deadlines , but rescheduling features is not a problem since everyone knows that the next delivery will also will be on time .
Quantitative scope can be defined in a similar way for software projects - for example , each release could include two important upgrades and twenty less important new features .
If the releases were frequent enough , and reliable , I am sure that most clients would agree to have features delivered through that pipeline .
The scope limit also works in the other direction - if we had more than 164 pages prepared for a single issue , some features would be thrown out .
They were stored in the famous ‘ first - aid kit ’ box , waiting to be published in the next issue .
The first - aid kit saved us from unexpected problems .
In programming terms , we had a write - buffer between the production and the release .
The software equivalent would be to defer deploying features , keeping some for the rainy days .
A certain pack of features would be delivered each month , and ‘ first - aid kit ’ items could be used to fill the gaps if the team was under - staffed or if some unexpected problems caused delays .
The key is in reaching reliability and consistency - giving the customers , marketing , sales and management a feeling of what they can expect , and making that promise come true .
From that viewpoint , it was much better to publish 164 pages two months in a row than to publish 200 pages one month , and only 128 in the next issue .
Our customers , sales or marketing did not know when we exceeded the quota , nor when we borrowed from the first - aid kit .
We delivered what we promised , and that was important .
Publishing software
All this can also be achieved in software - by moving away from software production into software publishing .
Each iteration would include a mix of important and less - important features , and would be delivered on time , giving customers the perception of predictability and consistency .
Applying the publishing model turns the typical software production upside down - in most software processes , features determine the release schedule , and release plans are known up - front .
Software publishing would start with the release schedule and quantitative scope - list of features would be derived from that .
We did not even have a release plan until half - way through the iteration in the magazine .
About two weeks before the deadline , we created the first version of the release plan by selecting features that were complete or could be completed in time .
The plan would then serve to focus the efforts - features that were not immediately required would get postponed , and people working on those features would help to finish articles that were included in the plan .
While most software plans are based on inter-dependencies of modules , publishing software introduces one additional goal - making each release interesting .
Important features should be spread so that each customer could see every release as something that adds value .
Key principles for turning iterative development into software publishing are :
Establish a reliable delivery cycle , with fixed dates ( it seems that one month or three - month cycles are most realistic ) .
Think about skipping one release during the summer , because of holidays .
Establish customer expectations about the structure and volume of releases ( example : three big items , 10 small enhancements , performance improvements ) .
Spread important features throughout iterations .
Note that this does not imply order of production - just the order of delivery .
Adjust the work threads to reach the goals - select a mix of hard and easy features for each iteration .
Half - way through each iteration , make a target ‘ release plan ’ for that iteration , listing all the features that should be included .
Then focus on finishing , polishing and integrating those features .
If features get thrown out of the release plan , or new features have to be added to it , do not expand the quantitative scope .
Replace big items with bit items , small features with small features , but do not change the total ‘ volume ’ of the release .
Form a first - aid kit of half - finished and complete features that were thrown out of the release plan or implemented above the quota , and include them in the next release .
The publishing model does not imply any underlying way of working , since it is mostly concerned with deployment and releases .
However , it would naturally fit iterative processes much better .
Longer projects are more suitable for publishing than shorter ones , since longer project can be divided into a lot of sequential iterations .
Dynamically scheduling features would require a relatively modular structure , but could also be applied to maintenance phases of a stable product .
Challenges of software publishing
The biggest challenge to the publishing model is cycle planning .
As with any change , it will take some time for the new way or working to stabilise - in XP terms , to measure the velocity .
After a few iterations , a good release cycle should emerge - and it will become clear how much work can be achieved in a cycle , when should the the release plan be created , what is the cut - off point for features , and how much time is required for polishing .
It took us four months to estimate this properly in the magazine , and I guess that it will take at least that much for software .
The second big challenge will probably be enforcing fixed date and scope , since we are not used to thinking about projects in those terms .
Typical software iterations are declared in terms of features and plans , with target date just as an estimate that could be easily changed .
In the publishing model , target date and scope define an iteration - the exact list of features is less important .
Hard deadline and hard scope limit are the focus points for the iteration - so it is very important to enforce them .
The third big challenge would be to find the appropriate driving force - the equivalent of magazine editors .
The responsibilities of a typical editor are divided in the software world among various senior positions .
This article is already too big , so I will leave the topic of editors and their responsibilities for some other time .
Great Expectations
Instead of specifying the list of features and then struggling to hit the date , software publishing would work by specifying the date and quantity and then trying to reach the features .
Predictability in terms of when and how much will be released would be built into the release process .
I expect that moving closer to the publishing model could significantly improve the way we deliver software on longer projects .
Achieving predictability and consistency should allow us to make more reliable long term plans .
Having fixed scope and delivery dates should serve as a good negotiation platform between programmers , project managers , sales and management .
Spreading key features throughout iterations will give the customers a perception that they are getting something important with each release .
Combined with a reliable delivery sequence , that should make our customers more satisfied and make negotiations about last - minute features much easier , since they will know that the next delivery can be reliably expected .
It should also allow easier release planning , and internal resource scheduling .
I have used the ‘ write - buffer ’ on several longer projects over the last two years , with very good results , but have never thought of the whole release process in publishing terms .
Of course , as Snepscheut put it , ‘ In theory , there is no difference between theory and practice .
But , in practice , there is ’.
This publishing paradigm may sound nice on paper ( or on the screen ) , but it will take a few published projects to actually prove that it works .
The idea sounds very promising , so I plan to test this model and see if it will live up to the promises .
Black Hatのようなカンファレンスの素晴らしい点の1つは、新しい友人ができることである。とりわけ、着ていたLinux
Tシャツを才能に恵まれた相手に褒められたような場合はそうだ。こうしてお近づきになったのがテリー・ギルバートさんとベッキー・ベースさんの両女史、これまでに出会ったギークやセキュリティ専門家の中でも最も注目すべき2人だ。年齢を推測するような野暮な真似をするつもりはないが、たぶん「お婆さんハッカー」と呼んでも彼女たちは気を悪くしないだろう。
カリフォルニア州出身の奇才テリー氏は、もう50年もコンピュータにかかわっている。一方、アラバマ州出身のベッキー氏は自他ともに認める実績を持ち、16年間、国家安全保障局（NSA）にいた彼女は、1980年代にNSAで開発されていた最初の侵入検知システムのプロジェクトマネジャーを務めた。
現在、両氏 はInfidelというコンピュータセキュリティの会社を共同で経営している。今回のBlack Hatで、ベッキーさん はExecutive Women's Forumによって企画された 「セキュリティ産業のグローバル化」というパネルディスカッションに参加していた。
2人は、テリーさんの幼なじみでNSAを退職した数学の天才マービン・シャファー氏を通じて出会った。彼が2人を引き合わせたとき、テリーさんはコンピュータセキュリティのビジネスの立ち上げを進めている最中で、片やベッキーさんはコンサルタントとして働いていた。
インタビューさせてほしいというわたしの申し出を両氏が快諾してくれたので、Black Hat Briefings初日の最後 にCaesar's Palaceのレストラン808で素晴らしい食事を摂った後、われわれはインタビューのために彼女たちの部屋へ向かった。
―― テリーさん、あなたがコンピュータにかかわり始めたのは1950年代ですね？
テリー ええ 、1956 年 にPopular Electronics誌の企画ですごく簡単な計算装置を作ったわ。だから今年がわたしのコンピュータエンジニアとしての50周年なのよ。
―― それはすごいですね！ すると、大学ではコンピュータ・サイエンスを学んだのですか？
テリー そのころはコンピュータ・サイエンスなんてものはなかったわ。
―― では、どちらの大学にいらっしゃったのですか？
テリー 1961 年 にHarvey Muddカレッジに入学して、卒業したのが1965年。わたしは15歳で高校を卒業していたから。
―― はじめて専門的にデータ処理に携わったのはいつですか？
テリー Harvey Muddに入学し た1961年に、CADETと呼ばれていたコンピュータ、IBM
1620 Model 1を大学が購入したの。CADETというのは、「足し算ができないし、しようともしない（Can't
Add , Does n't Even Try）」というフレーズの頭文字よ。1620を知ってるかしら、0を3で表現するって意味のXS3（Excess-3）コードに基づく10進方式のマシンだった。
表引き（テーブルルックアップ）方式で算術演算を行うので、マシンを起動したらまず足し算とかけ算の計算表を下位メモリに格納するの。次に、桁上げなども含めた表引きの処理を実行する算術ルーチンを読み込ませる。紙テープやIBM製Selectricコンソールなど、とにかくすべてを最初から用意しなければならなかった。その上、初期のカードリーダーときたら本当に扱いづらくて、ずっと動かしておく必要があったわ。
でも、それをすべてやっていたのは学生たち。つまり、そこにはオペレーターも専門家もいなかったの。メンテナンスして、マシンを走らせ続け、それにプログラムも作らなくてはならなかった。バイナリコード以外の言語で使えるものといえば、アセンブラと、IBMが提供していたGOTRANというプログラムだけだった。
ご想像のとおり 、GOTRANはFORTRANの前身になったものよ。少しFORTRANに似ていたけれど、1行につき1つしか演算子が使えないので、A = B + Cのような演算しか書けないという制限があったわ。まるでアセンブリ言語のようなだけど、書式の点ではアセンブリ言語とは違っていた。

A future of overpopulation is one of a number of hoary old objections to progress and longer , healthier lives .
It has been raised over and over again throughout recent history , but like all other Malthusian concepts , it was wrong then , and it 's just as wrong now .
Common Malthusianism - the idea that a given resource ( such as living space or food ) will run out in the future based upon extrapolation of present trends - stems from fundamental misunderstandings about economics , human action and change .
We create change in response to our environment ; our self - interest leads us to constantly strive at the creation of new resources where old resources are becoming scarce and expensive .
This is the path to profit for the individual - and progress for all .
One needs a certain amount of willful blindness to avoid seeing the process in action now and in recent history .
The ideas of Malthus were just as wrong as the ideas of those who warn of overpopulation today , and for just the same reasons .
The simple answers to any claim of overpopulation with increasing longevity are much as follows :
1 ) Population growth declines and reverses with increasing wealth , longevity and technological progress :
Decelerating population growth appears to be an inevitable result of growing wealth .
Early on in a country 's developmental curve , children can be regarded as ' producer goods ' ( as economists would say ) .
Parents put their children to work on the farm to generate food and revenue .
Very little effort is put into caring for the child : no expensive health plans , special classes , trips to Disneyland , X - Men action figures , or mounting phone bills .
As we become wealthier , children become ' consumer goods ' .
That is , we look on them more and more as little people to be enjoyed and pampered and educated , not beasts of burden to help keep the family alive .
We spend thousands of dollars on children to keep them healthy , entertain them , and educate them .
We come to prefer fewer children to a vast mob of little ones .
This preference seems to be reinforced by changing tastes resulting from improved education .
UPDATE 05/28/2010 : Researchers Leonid Gavrilov and Natalia Gavrilova have produced detailed population models to demonstrate that even large increases in human life span produce comparatively small changes in population size .
You can find a summary near the end of a more recent Fight Aging !
post , or at PubMed :
For example , we applied the cohort - component method of population projections to 2005 Swedish population for several scenarios of life extension and a fertility schedule observed in 2005 .
Even for very long 100 - year projection horizon , with the most radical life extension scenario ( assuming no aging at all after age 60 ) , the total population increases by 22 % only ( from 9.1 to 11.0 million ) .
Moreover , if some members of society reject to use new anti-aging technologies for some religious or any other reasons ( inconvenience , non-compliance , fear of side effects , costs , etc. ) , then the total population size may even decrease over time .
2 ) It is self - evident from even a few back of the envelope calculations that the Earth can support tens of billions in comfort using the technology of today - and never mind the rest of the solar system once the cost of getting into orbit has been sufficiently reduced .
So it turns out that if 5 % of the United States were converted into urban area with a population density of 6,000 / km2 , and 45 % were converted into suburban area with a population density of 2,000 / km2 , with the remaining 50 % left for rural area , parks , and farms , there would be enough room for 3 billion in the urban areas , and 9 billion in the suburban areas , for a total population of 12 billion .
This is in the US alone .
This scheme could be extended to the other countries and continents for a total population of around 100 billion .
Everything between the Arctic and Antarctic circles are potential targets for colonization .
This is about 130,000,000 km2 of land area ( the circumpolar regions have about 20,000,000 km2 of land ) .
3 ) What some presently view as " overpopulation " is more accurately described as crushing poverty amidst the potential for plenty and resources left unused .
This is the result of despotism , corruption , economic ignorance , short - sighted greed and the inhumanity of man unto man - it is not a matter of counting heads .
Here , then , is a short guide for kleptocrats and egalitarians who want to keep their countries poor .
All of these policies have stood the test of time as techniques for creating and maintaining poverty .
The list is by no means exhaustive , but it will give would - be political leaders a good idea of how to start their countries on the road to ruin .
Malthusianism and cries of overpopulation in the face of a future of healthy life extension are forms of relinquishment .
It is a call for death and suffering to continue on a massive scale ; a certain type of person prefers any present horror to the uncertainty of change .
Fortunately , such people have usually been swept aside in the past by the urge of the many to better their lives , one step at a time .
May that long continue to be the case .

I would like to start this post just by saying that I know that there are many horrors of alcohol abuse and not just benefits of beer and that there are many reasons why drinking alcohol may lead to an early exit .
But at the same time I just bottled my fourth batch of home made beer , Barons Beer actually , and thought that it would be fun to come up with a great big list of why beer is good for you .
Health Benefits of Beer For All Of Us
Cancer preventer – A compound found only in hops , which are used to make beer , have been discovered as benefits of beer to prevent cancer .
Of course we all know that hops are an ingredient in beer and therefore Xanthohumol has high hopes of making the beer a new anti cancer drug .
Xanthohumol flavinoids have been tested and its use is hoped to be a preventative treatment against prostate and colon cancer and even may be a form of hormone therapy for women .
Getting your vitamins – A friend of mine used to say there is a pork chop in every glass of beer but recent studies show that there is vitamin B6 in beer increases the level of vitamin B6 in a beer drinkers blood which has been shown to decrease the level of homocysteine which increase the chances of heart disease .
Reducing chance of heart disease – another of the benefits of beer is that alcohol drinkers had higher levels of high - density lipoprotein ( HDL ) cholesterol , often called the “ good ” cholesterol , which is a protective form of blood fat .
The alcohol drinkers also had lower levels of fibrinogen , a protein that promotes blood clots , as well as elevated levels of other molecules ( platelets ) that prevent the clotting and stickiness of blood cells .
Reduction in Kidney stones – A Finnish - U.S. study of beer - drinking , middle - aged men was published in the American Journal of Epidemiology in 1999 .
The report stated that an increase in beer consumption may reduce the risk of developing kidney stones .
Results showed that there was a 40 percent lower risk of kidney stones in beer drinkers , but the researchers were stumped as to whether the benefits of beer results were due to water , alcohol or hops .
Defying the bad of X - Rays – Beer helps reduce chromosomal damage from radiation exposure thanks to beta-pseudouridine .
According to a study by the Japanese researchers from the National Institute of Radiological Sciences , and the Tokyo University of Science Blood samples were taken from test subjects before and after they had drunk about 630 ml of beer .
Apparently , when the samples were exposed to X - rays and other types of radiation , after the subjects had drank the beer their samples showed at least 30 % fewer aberrations in the blood cells .
Memory Booster – A Swedish team has shown that mice fed with moderate amounts of alcohol grew new nerve cells in the brain .
The full implications of the Karolinska Institute research – which appears in the International Journal of Neuropsychopharmacology – are unclear on the benefits of beer , but Stefan Brene told the BBC :
“ We believe that the increased production of new nerve cells during moderate alcohol consumption can be important for the development of alcohol addiction and other long - term effects of alcohol on the brain . ”
Slow the Aging Process –
In a study published in the March issue of International Immunopharmacology , scientists at Austria ’s Innsbruck Medical University found that hops , a key ingredient in beer , affect the production of neopterin , a telltale sign of inflammation , and levels of the amino acid tryptophan ( low levels are associated with more inflammation . )
Keeps you Awake – Although there is no caffeine in Beer , beer was found to reduce neopterin production and suppress degradation of tryptophan , according to a study .
( Tryptophan is also commonly cited as the reason people feel tired after gorging on Thanksgiving turkey . )
This suppression might be connected with the calming effect of beer , ” the researchers note , “ since its normalizing effect on the tryptophan balance improves the availability of the ‘ happiness hormone ’ serotonin . ”
And who would n’t want happiness to be more available ?
OK and now a few more benefits of beer from me
Relaxation –
This is a good one for almost anyone that has sat on a patio on a spring or summer afternoon .
The relaxation and relief of stress is famous for those having a beer even if the conversation always seems to turn to those office politics that get everyone riled up .
Reduces inhibitions –
As we all know there are times we wish that we had gotten up and said something , either to those at work or a pretty girl at a bar and for this the alcohol in beer is a very good lubricant to the mind and mouth and will help in those situations where shyness gets the better of us .
Excuse for bad behavior – although there is no link to bad behavior and beer , many people have been known to say or do bad and ridiculous things and in the case where someone had consumed to much beer before this well there is a good excuse just waiting to be used .
So the next time someone looks down their nose at you for the stories that you tell about the night before and the beer that you drank .
Come back here and point out that you were just doing the healthy thing there are benefits of beer and having a couple of beers is great .
Liberals called it " Fitzmas " .
And it was a long time coming .
But even though it took almost two years for special prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald to make it down the chimney , it was worth the wait .
Lewis " Scooter " Libby , the chief of staff of vice - president Dick Cheney , faces up to 30 years in prison and a fine of $ 1.25 m if found guilty of lying over his role in leaking the identity of a covert CIA agent .
Meanwhile , the continuing investigation of George Bush 's consiglieri , Karl Rove , holds out the possibility of further charges against a more senior White House staff member .
In a week that saw Bush withdraw his supreme court nominee , Harriet Miers , and that followed a week in which Tom DeLay , the Republican house leader , was arrested for money laundering and conspiracy , liberals were gorging themselves on a festival of alleged corruption , criminality and incompetence prepared and served by conservatives .
The extent to which these most recent developments have exposed the Bush administration 's real agenda and modus operandi should be welcomed .
But legal defeats for the right should not be mistaken as political victories for the liberal - left , which has yet to convince anyone that it represents a meaningful alternative .
There is a thin line between what we know to be true and what we can show to be undeniable .
Whether it 's Rodney King or Abu Ghraib , only with incontrovertible evidence does an assertion shift from a debating point to a reference point .
All that separates the misfortunes of Kate Moss from the fortunes of David Cameron is the money shot .
We can tolerate the notion that a potential Conservative party leader has taken cocaine so long as we have n't seen it ; we cannot tolerate the fact that a waifish model has taken cocaine because we have .
Fitzgerald 's investigation crossed that line , laying out in clear detail the proof for some of the central criticisms the liberal - left has asserted about the Bush administration over the past five years .
First , that the case for the invasion of Iraq was built on a lie .
This goes to the heart of the matter .
Valerie Plame was a covert CIA agent whose husband , the former ambassador Joseph Wilson , was sent on a CIA - sponsored trip to investigate whether Iraq was seeking to buy uranium from Niger for nuclear weapons .
Wilson concluded that this was unlikely but the claim ended up in Bush 's state of the union address anyhow .
When it came to Saddam 's supposed weapon 's cache , the White House was not the victim of flawed intelligence .
It was the wilful perpetrator of known falsehood .
Second , that lie could only be sustained by discrediting those who dared to expose it .
On July 6 2003 , Wilson accused the Bush administration of exaggerating the case for war in an article in the New York Times .
Libby sought to trash Wilson 's credibility by telling reporters that Plame helped arrange her husband 's trip , thus revealing her identity and sparking the investigation .
It is a crime knowingly to divulge the identity of an undercover CIA operative .
For the team that stood a candidate whose wealthy connections ensured he never saw combat while rubbishing the actual war record of his opponent , John Kerry , this was business as usual .
Two days after Wilson 's piece appeared a Pew poll showed that over the previous four months the number of Americans who believed the military effort in Iraq was going very well had slumped form 61 % to 23 % ; the number of those who thought it was not going well had rocketed from 4 % to 21 % .
Three months after Bush landed on the USS Lincoln emblazoned with its Mission Accomplished banner , both the message and the mission was tanking ; it was time to shoot the messengers along with the Iraqis .
Third , the case has revealed the supine character of America 's mainstream media in the run-up to the war .
Primarily , it showcased the sharp practices of New York Times reporter Judith Miller .
In Miller 's own account of her grand jury testimony , she wrote : " When the subject turned to Mr Wilson , Mr Libby requested that he be identified only as a ' former Hill staffer ' [ rather than " senior administration official " ] .
I agreed to the new ground rules because I knew that Mr Libby had once worked on Capitol Hill . "
I once played centre forward for Cygnet Rovers of Stevenage .
But to cite me as " a former footballer " would , in most instances , be as true as it is misleading .
Miller 's uncritical approach amounted to dictation that bolstered the administration 's flimsy case for going to war .
" WMD - I got it totally wrong , " she told Times reporters recently .
" If your sources are wrong , you are wrong .
I did the best job that I could . "
Neither the Times in particular nor US journalism in general should be judged by the standards of one reporter .
But while Miller 's reporting style in the run-up to the war was appaling , its content was not aberrant .
Following the terrorist attacks of September 11 , the administration circled the wagons around the flag and the media found itself on the wrong side .
Politically embedded at home before they were military embedded abroad , their fear of appearing unpatriotic trumped their fear of misinforming the public .
So the investigation has given us one of the clearest indications to date of how we got to this point .
Given the malevolent partisanship of the Republican party it is not surprising that many liberals gloat at the prospect of a full - scale Republican implosion .
But such schadenfreude is premature .
The wounds of recent weeks have all been self - inflicted - the result of a mixture of hubris , malice , greed and ineptitude .
There is no doubt that they have damaged Bush politically .
A Washington Post - ABC poll this weekend shows his approval rating at an all - time low , with the public believing Bill Clinton ran a more ethical administration after the Monica Lewinsky scandal than Bush does now .
Meanwhile , An AP - Ipsos poll released on Saturday shows support for the war at an all - time low of 37 % .
But the Democrats are not faring much better , with only marginally more support than Republicans , according to a poll taken before the indictments and Miers withdrawal , but after hurricane Katrina and DeLay 's arrest .
Having supported the war and without coherent proposals for disengaging , they are ill - placed to take advantage of the Republican 's current troubles .
Either unable or unwilling to present a clear agenda of how they would do things differently , they have been effectively mute for several months .
With no opposition , popular disenchantment with the Bush Administration 's ethical failings is descending into cynicism .
Indeed , the only group that has really flexed its muscles in recent weeks has been the Christian right , which derailed Mier 's nomination to the supreme court .
Bush is likely to nominate another candidate later this week who will be more to their liking , thereby tipping the balance of the court against abortion and affirmative action .
Unless the Democrats develop the wherewithal to challenge them , conservatives will then shape both the law and the politics of the country for a generation .
And Fitzmas will be little more than a lingering reminder of what the law can do when politics has failed .

Too many companies are like bad marriages
It 's been said that the secret to a good marriage is ... do n't change .
In other words , be the person you were when you were merely dating .
Do n't stop paying attention .
Do n't stop being kind .
Do n't gain 50 pounds .
Do n't stop flirting .
Stay passionate , stay sexy , stay caring .
Answer their calls .
Unfortunately , too many companies are all candle - lit dinners , fine wine , and " let 's talk about you " until the deal is sealed .
Once they have you ( i.e. you became a paying customer ) , you realize you got a bait - and - switch relationship .
This is such a big bowl of wrong .
I do n't understand this in personal relationships , and I do n't understand it in business - to - customer relationships .
Should n't you treat the people you 're in a relationship with better than you treat anyone else ?
Should n't you treat your existing customers better than the ones who 've given you nothing ?
Most companies would never outsource their sales reps , but we all know what happens with most tech support .
Most companies would never make a brochure with the same ( lack of ) quality in the product manual .
Most companies would never make their main website as uninviting as the tech support site .
If we want passionate users , we should take a lesson from successful marriages and keep the spark alive .
Just because they 're now a " sure thing " does n't mean we take them for granted .
Besides , if we shift that marketing and ad budget from pre-sales to post - sales , we wo n't have to worry about getting new customers .
Our loyal , cared - for customers will take care of that .

Love the pictures , but I think we need a new metaphor for this type of discussion .
I 'm 13 years into what feels like a very good marriage , but it certainly does n't resemble our dating days any longer .
Sometimes , in fact , it looks more like the " After " pictures and comments than the " Before " — and I KNOW my wife would agree . :-)
But that 's a big part of what makes a successful marriage .
It 's not in maintaining some breathless passion ( while the kids are grumbling about taking out the dog or saying , again , " I do n't want THAT for dinner . " ) .
It 's in sharing the full experience of life with someone who cares as much as you do about what really matters in life .
I do n't have yet a good replacement metaphor , but I 'm sure it 's out there . . .
Posted by : John Windsor | Feb 25 , 2007 8:40:08 AM
Nice post .
The situation can be improved by understanding the importance of customer service in marketing -- specifically , in retention of existing customers and the generation of positive references therefrom -- and adopting appropriate metrics .
The number " new revenue from existing customers , " for example , usually has at least as much to do with the customer service function as it does with the classical sales function .
Posted by : david foster | Feb 25 , 2007 9:49:07 AM
Too right , Kathy !
The trouble is , we all know it , but we do n't seem to be in a position to do anything about it .
When we raise the matter with those who are , we 're told that we 're naive and we do n't understand all the ins and outs .
We 're all customers in some way , shape or form - how many more ins and outs can there be ??

Well written , a great use of images and artistry .
You always do a great job of separating your content from the rest of the content producers in the blogosphere .
As for the article , there are always companies that love new customers , and then see existing customers as revenue drivers .
You can't purchase a cellphone without experiencing this .
There are also a veritable plethora of companies that do n't do this .
There are also a minority of companies that love existing customers , and treat them in a special way .
Find those companies , and write a post about how they do the opposite --- call out the good ones !!!!!!!
Posted by : Kevin Hillstrom | Feb 25 , 2007 11:19:11 AM
Quoting from ' freakonomics ' what is the incentive for companies to keep their customers happy ?
Their challenge was to get a customer , which they did .
Obviously after they have sold a 2000 $ Nikon D200 , what is the need for the company to still care for you ?
By the way I can not see how the topic heading relates to the post ?
How does the presence of too many companies change this attitude .
Would 'nt you think the more the competitors , the more would companies try to get and keep their customers .

The double bird is the best ... it's straight from my mental images of tech support ( and insurance , mortgage houses , and credit card companies ... )
I can't mention enough how Stone Design ( www.stone.com) provides great software and support .
You can talk to THE MAN himself ( Andrew Stone ) and he offers FREE UPGRADES for life .
Stone does n't believe in eating into his own customer base .
So instead of constantly wondering if you 're getting your money 's worth , you become a Stone salesman !
Everyone always has the latest version - so the user is happy .
And he only has to support ONE version .
It 's a happy marriage .

I had been thinking about sexual metaphors for describing the way brands communicate with consumers ( http://memehuffer.typepad.com/meme_huffer/2007/02/brand_kama_sutr.html) but this takes a more interesting , wider approach .
And less liable to attract the wrong kind of visitors to my blog !
Posted by : Jason Lonsdale | Feb 25 , 2007 4:04:50 PM
This post really struck a chord .
I 've had some amazingly bad experiences lately with customer service with online services ; the kind of thing that just drives me nuts .
In one case I purchased a season pass for a TV show on iTunes and instead of the purchase being debited against my gift card balance , it was charged against my credit card .
When the problem was " corrected " the new shows stopped downloading to my computer .
It is n't such a big deal to me that sometimes things go wrong , but what does make me crazy is that both times when I tried to contact customer service it took me nearly a half an hour to figure out how to actually contact them .
I kept ending up in some circular loop where I would just keep seeing the same pages over and over again , but none of them ( even the one whose URL was linked with the words " contact us " ) actually let me contact them .
The other situation occurred with NetFlix .
They sent me two copies of the same episode of a PBS series on accident ( instead of two different episodes ) .
I reported the issue and sent them both back in the same envelope ; for over a week only one registered as returned .
I guess their system did n't know how to deal with getting a title back that they did n't think that I had .
Again , odd situation and no big deal that there was an issue .
But ... , it took careful parsing of the " contact us " links and at least a half an hour ( hey , maybe I 'm just dumb ) to figure out how to tell them , not just that I had a problem , but to actually be able to tack on a note to say what the problem was .
I love both of these services but I 'm one issue away from switching to blockbuster so that I can drive to the store if I have a problem like this ( and presumably find a human to talk to about it ) and I 've already started buying my music and movies on , gasp , discs again because this is just too damned irritating .
These guys just do n't get it .
When they bury their customer services links deep inside of a spider 's nest of links and then steadfastly refuse on somekind of quasi-religious basis to offer an 800 number , they are n't saving money , they are losing revenue .
Customer service can be a great value add and could be cementing me as a user , but instead it is driving me away from services I would otherwise really love .
I know this comment is probably TMI but I needed a sympathetic ear to vent to !

Karyn : " When we raise the matter with those who are , we 're told that we 're naive and we do n't understand all the ins and outs . "
We 'll just have to change that , one small step at a time .
More and more companies are starting to appreciate the value of passionate users ... who become evangelists ... who become community members ...
The companies that get this * right * are rewarded , and can have a competitive advantage , and that will ( fingers crossed ) drive more companies to do the right thing , even if it means kicking and screaming . ; )
Sesh : " Their challenge was to get a customer , which they did .
Obviously after they have sold a 2000 $ Nikon D200 , what is the need for the company to still care for you ? "
I 'm glad you brought that up ... three big reasons why they should still care , especially in the case of a company like Nikon :
1 ) A $ 2,000 Nikon is nothing compared to what one could spend on a single good lens ... assuming Nikon does a decent job of helping me appreciate why I now need one .
2 ) If there 's little to differentiate high - end consumer / prosumer equipment ( Canon vs. Nikon ) , then Nikon should hope that their customers will want to continue to stick with Nikon because Nikon helped them kick ass .
3 ) The better care they take of me , the more they increase the chances that I might become passionate about photography ( and Nikon for supporting it ) , and now I 'm out there evangelizing Nikon to everyone else ...
There are also a lot of products and services for the costs of acquiring a new customer greatly exceed the costs to keep one .
I agree that there are companies who have little incentive to take care of a customer , but they wo n't be reading a blog called " creating passionate users " , so I do n't usually address those kinds of products .
Then again , I 'd take it as a personal challenge to argue that almost ANY product can be associated with passion .
When we talk about " passion " here , we do n't always mean passion for the product ... we mean passion for the thing the product lets the user do .
A creative company ( with a mundane utility ) could choose to help someone kick - ass at something completely unrelated .
( Red Bull sponsors the DJ music academy .
Nobody wants to become a Red Bull expert , but they CAN become passionate about DJing , and Red Bull helps ' users ' kick ass at that ) .

" Most companies would never outsource their sales reps , but we all know what happens with most tech support . "
I think this incorrectly points the blame at outsourced tech support .
Whether tech support is outsourced or not , the problem is the attitude of the company that is outsourcing , and the reasons why they outsource .
When tech support is bad , it 's because the company does n't value it , so they choose a super cheap provider of support .
I 'm certain that if a company valued support , that they could find a provider of high quality support services , put the necessary time in to train these people , and actually end up providing better support than if they did it themselves .
And the provider would have the extra pressure of knowing that if they do n't provide good support , they can be changed much more easily than if the support was done in house .
Outsourcing can result in _better_ service ... but only if you look much deeper than the bottom line .
( Note : I do not work for nor am I associated with any provider of tech support :) )
Posted by : Jon N. | Feb 25 , 2007 10:29:22 PM
Jon : I completely agree .
The outsourcing is not the problem ... it 's just that it 's usually a symptom of devaluing support ( at least as compared to pre-sales support ) .
But yes , a company could definitely outsource support and do it right -- as opposed to just making it about saving money .
Thanks for pointing that out ; I think you made a really valuable point .

Introduction
Apple Mac mini ( Core Solo )
Manufacturer : Apple ( product page )
Price : US$ 599
Up until Apple 's " fun " announcement on the last day of February , there was really no indication of how Apple 's low - end Intel offerings would be presented .
Now that Apple has disclosed the specification and price points for their entry - level machines , we can get a better idea of where Apple is trying to take their product line .
For those people who might be unaware , two new Mac Mini models were released and by most accounts , the products have been well received aside from a few quibbles over specifications .
The biggest topic of discussion and opinion slinging online is Apple 's decision to go with an Intel integrated graphics chipset .
That has reportedly caused a lot of people to postpone their purchases .
There are a number of reasons for the outcry , and rest assured we 'll touch on them throughout this review .
Most importantly , we 'll try our best to determine how much that decision will hurt the Mini 's performance and possible future sales .
I am actually an owner of a first - generation Mac mini with a 1.25 GHz G4 processor .
I 'll be using that machine to highlight that changes to the model throughout this review .
My G4 mini is currently exclusively used as a media center PC connected to our TV in the living room and attached to an ElGato EyeTV 200 for watching TV and scheduling television recordings .
One of the biggest failings of the original Mac mini in my eyes was that Apple failed to anticipate the desire of users to connect their minis to their television and home entertainment centers for watching video , showing off slideshows of their photos , and listening to music .
In essence , I think Apple blew a big chance to make their first foray into the living room by not shipping the original minis with an application like Front Row .
I 'm sure that Apple had considered the possibility originally , and perhaps the rise of several open source projects and user - run blogs on the subject cemented their resolve to transition the miniat least partially to a device of this stature .
This could all be wishful thinking , however , as I was one of those people running a blog dedicated to helping people use their mini in the living room .
Here 's how the two new models stack up :
Mac mini Solo Mac Mini Duo Processor 1.50 GHz single core Intel Core Solo CPU 1.66GHz dual - core Intel Core Duo CP Memory 512MB PC2-5300 DDR2 SDRAM
Hard drive 60 GB SATA 80GB SATA Optical Combo Drive Double - layer SuperDrive Wireless 802.11g and Bluetooth 2.0 Graphics Intel GMA950 Price US$ 599 US$ 799

For decades , scientists have taken issue with “ string theory ” — a theory of the universe which contends that the fundamental forces and matter of nature can be reduced to tiny one - dimensional filaments called strings — because it does not make predictions that can be tested .
But researchers at the University of California , San Diego , Carnegie Mellon University , and The University of Texas at Austin have now developed an important test for this controversial “ theory of everything . ”
Described in a paper that will appear in the January 26 issue of the journal Physical Review Letters , their test involves measurements of how elusive high - energy particles scatter during particle collisions .
Most physicists believe those collisions will be observable at the Large Hadron Collider , or LHC , a subatomic particle collider scheduled to be operating later this year at the European Laboratory for Particle Physics , or CERN .
“ Our work shows that , in principle , string theory can be tested in a non-trivial way , ” explained Ira Rothstein , co-author of the paper and professor of physics at Carnegie Mellon .
Rothstein and colleagues Jacques Distler , a professor of physics at The University of Texas at Austin ; Benjamin Grinstein , a professor of physics at the University of California , San Diego ; and Carnegie Mellon graduate student Rafael Porto developed their test based on studies of how strongly force - carrying particles called W bosons scatter in high - energy particle collisions generated within a particle accelerator .
W bosons are special because they carry a property called the weak force , which provides a fundamental way for particles to interact with one another .
When the LHC turns on later this year , scientists will begin to investigate the scattering of W bosons , which has not been possible with other particle accelerators .
Because the new test follows from a measurement of W boson scattering , it could eventually be performed at the LHC , according to the authors .
“ The beauty of our test is the simplicity of its assumptions , ” explained Grinstein of UCSD .
“ The canonical forms of string theory include three mathematical assumptions — Lorentz invariance ( the laws of physics are the same for all uniformly moving observers ) , analyticity ( a smoothness criteria for the scattering of high - energy particles after a collision ) and unitarity ( all probabilities always add up to one ) .
Our test sets bounds on these assumptions . ”
He added , “ If the test does not find what the theory predicts about W boson scattering , it would be evidence that one of string theory ’s key mathematical assumptions is violated .
In other words , string theory — as articulated in its current form — would be proven impossible . ”
“ If the bounds are satisfied , we would still not know that string theory is correct , ” said Distler .
“ But , if the bounds are violated , we would know that string theory , as it is currently understood , could not be correct .
At the very least , the theory would have to be reshaped in a highly nontrivial way . ”
String theory attempts to unify nature ’s four fundamental forces ( gravity , electromagnetism , and the strong and weak forces ) by positing that everything at the most basic level consists of strands of energy that vibrate at various rates and in multiple , undiscovered dimensions .
These “ strings ” produce all known forces and particles in the universe , thus reconciling Einstein ’s theory of general relativity ( the large ) with quantum mechanics ( the small ) .
Proponents say that string theory is elegant and beautiful .
Dissenters argue that it does not make predictions that be tested experimentally , so the theory cannot be proven or falsified .
And no particle accelerator yet exists that can attain the high energies needed to detect strings .
Because of this technical limitation , tests of string theory have remained elusive until now .
“ Since we do n’t have a complete understanding of string theory , it ’s impossible to rule out all possible models that are based on strings , ” said Rothstein .
“ However , most string theory models are based upon certain mathematical assumptions , and what we ’ve shown is that such string theories have some definite predictions that can be tested . ”

" Things do seem to be getting worse very quickly .
Free - fall is a strong word , but I think it ’s the right one to use here , " says Paul Ashworth , chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics .
But most Americans look into the future , see a weakening property market , and fear not .
They have been told that soft housing prices pose no problems for the rest of the economy .
They have no reason to doubt that it is true ; no reason to squint and try to see further .
They dread neither slump nor boom … neither war nor peace .
They believe everything will be managed by the authorities so as to do no great damage to the homeland .
But you typically do n’t lose money ( or make it ) when things happen as expected .
No one plans on losing his life savings .
It comes as a surprise — along with sudden death , financial crashes , and other crises .
Where will the surprise come from this time ?
We wonder , because things that are expected present few opportunities and few catastrophes .
When an old man dies , people gather at his grave almost with relief .
Finally , it is over .
His affairs are usually sorted out long before he reaches room temperature .
So , the book can be closed and put down .
No more chapters , footnotes , or postscripts .
Time to move on .
But when a young man dies , it is as if the printer had made a mistake .
The story is unfinished .
We turn the page expecting to find out what happens , and there is nothing there .
The young man typically dies suddenly and unexpectedly , leaving crops in the field and his widow and children in the house .
While the widow grieves , grasping neighbors move their fences , taking what was once his …and banks wonder if his mortgage will be repaid .
“ I ca n’t tell you how hard it was , ” explained a neighbor , widowed before she was 40 , with five children , one of whom was severely retarded .
“ Suddenly , everything changed .
My husband had borrowed money to modernize the farm .
But I really did n’t know how to pay it back .
And then , farm prices were falling .
And our farm hands all demanded more money .
And nobody would give me any time or credit because they all thought I would fail and have to sell the place .
It seemed like everyone was angling for something … and I had my children to look after .
Those were the most difficult years of my life . ”
If there are going to be difficult years in America , however , Americans are not worrying .
They recall the last recession in 2001 , almost fondly .
Even before they had forgone a single Krispy Kreme donut…or darned a single sock … the recession was over .
And on its heels came the biggest boom in housing prices the world had ever seen .
Recession ?
The last one was no trouble ; why should they worry about the next ?
The expected slump poses no danger to them .
But what if the slump is not what Americans expect ?
What if the softening of housing prices is not so benign ?
What if the roof really does cave in ?
Ah … that would come as a shock .
The Guardian took up the idea this week , quoting Paul Ashworth :
“ House prices have been rising at unprecedented double - digit rates in recent years , giving homeowners massive windfalls and supporting a wave of investment in new construction .
However , the number of unsold new homes is now at a 10 - year high . ”
Ashworth reckons that 30 percent of all the jobs created since the end of the last recession in 2001 — 1.4 million — have been in sectors related to the housing market boom , from construction to DIY stores .
As the boom runs out of steam , he calculates that 73,000 jobs a month will be lost .
And , also in the Guardian , Stephen Roach warns , “ for a wealth - dependent U.S. economy , the bursting of another major asset bubble is likely to be a very big deal . ”
He notes , “ With U.S. fiscal and trade imbalances now larger than five years ago , the fallout for the rest of the world could be more devastating than the aftermath of the dotcom boom . ”
Of course , we have no more idea than anyone else .
But at least we know what to look for — the unanticipated .
What analysts broadly anticipate is a “ soft landing ” in housing … and no landing at all in stocks .
What is unanticipated is a hard crash .
Will it come ?
We do n’t know .
But at least we have n’t failed to anticipate it .
u2022 Yesterday , it rained all day .
It was dismal … dreary … almost depressing .
We had a fire in the dining room fireplace , and in our library , an octagonal building out in the yard , we had to turn on the gas heat .
Maria has gone back to school in London .
Jules has left for school in Boston .
Our last summer guests left this morning .
These are the last few days of summer …and there is an air of sadness about them … the kind of sweet tristesse that you get at the end of a long vacation .
Of course , this was no real vacation for us ; we worked every day .
But it was on our summer schedule and in our summerhouse … with our summer friends around … and the family coming and going .
And now , it is time to close up the house .
Elizabeth left for Paris this morning to try to put our new apartment in order and this weekend , we will close the shutters … bolt the doors … put away the tools … lock up the library and the wine cellar …and prepare for another long year of work .
“ I love it out here , ” she said last night .
“ Especially this year , I really felt it — why I like this place so much .
There are so many people around who care about the same things I do .
They care about gardens , and old houses , and history , and manners .
I feel more at home here in many ways than I ever did in Maryland . ”
This summer , there seemed to be an especially active social life in this area .
We attended two weddings , several dinners , and a couple of parties .
None of them were particularly elegant , but all were tastefully done … and attended by interesting , cultivated people .
“ Oh , my … I think this is our first serious social faux pas , ” Elizabeth remarked as we walked to a party on Saturday night , only half joking .
We were approaching an ancient house , by way of a causeway between two large ponds .
The house was of stone , substantial , and remarkably simple …with unpainted wooden windows that looked hundreds of years old .
But as we were walking along we passed other guests , all wearing masks .
And then , a sign reminded us we were supposed to have “ come masked ! ”
“ Uh oh … ”
It was only then we realized that the invitation had not proposed a “ masque , ” in the Shakespearian sense of a private revelry … but a masked party … like a masked ball .
And here we were , arriving unmasked ….our faces naked .
We were exposed as rude , foreign oafs — they might even take us for Americans !
But , the party evolved nicely … the masks came off after a while , revealing several friendly faces .
“ Yes , ” Elizabeth continuing her line of thought , “ I like this area … and these people .
They are as moss - backed as I am .
“ But one man I met was even more moss - backed .
He was a monarchist .
You know , when people tell me that they are monarchists , I never quite believe them .
They sound as if they are pulling my leg ….
just being provocative … not serious … like you are when you say you favor monarchy . ”
“ But I am serious , ” we replied .
“ Well , maybe … but this man is actively working for the restoration of the Bourbons …even though he admitted that there was no chance that France would support a king again . ”
u2022 An item in the news caught our eye the other day .
Senator Lieberman compared the war in Iraq to the Spanish Civil War ; it is a harbinger of worse to come , he wrote .
Coincidentally , we too have been reading about the Spanish Civil War in a history by Anthony Beevor .
What interested us is that both sides — from before the war began…up until the day before yesterday — shared a common assumption .
They both argued that they had the support of the masses .
Votes were analyzed , polls taken , speeches deconstructed , both sides trying to prove that it had the right to rule — because it enjoyed the most popular support .
And each side committed sordid , barbarous acts : murder , rape , pillage , theft — you name it — secure in the knowledge that it had 51 % of the population behind it and thus had the right to govern .
And today , the idea is hardly ever contested .
“ Majority rule ” replaced monarchial rule a long time ago .
But we wonder what makes it better ?
What gives people the right to rule one over another …merely because at that particular moment , in those particular circumstances , there are more lumps on one side than the other ?
No thank you , dear reader .
We are not democrats .
Instead , give us a good king .
Put him on the throne and tell him to mind his business .
And if he taxes too heavily , spends too much , or dares to drag the country into war or absurdity — off with his head !

While we are naturally focused on Iraq , a larger war is emerging .
On one side are extremists and terrorists led and sponsored by Iran , on the other moderates and democrats supported by the United States .
Iraq is the most deadly battlefield on which that conflict is being fought .
How we end the struggle there will affect not only the region but the worldwide war against the extremists who attacked us on Sept. 11 , 2001 .
This bloodshed , moreover , is not the inevitable product of ancient hatreds .
It is the predictable consequence of a failure to ensure basic security and , equally important , of a conscious strategy by al - Qaeda and Iran , which have systematically aimed to undermine Iraq 's fragile political center .
On this point , let there be no doubt :
If Iraq descends into full - scale civil war , it will be a tremendous battlefield victory for al - Qaeda and Iran .
Iraq is the central front in the global and regional war against Islamic extremism .
Radical Islamist terrorist groups , both Sunni and Shiite , would reap victories simultaneously symbolic and tangible , as Iraq became a safe haven in which to train and strengthen their foot soldiers and Iran 's terrorist agents .
“ Our first task is to convince Western countries to adopt a tough approach to the Iranian problem , ” which he called “ the biggest threat facing the Jewish people since the Second World War . ” [ Minister ]
Lieberman insisted that negotiations with Iran were worthless : “ The dialogue with Iran will be a 100 - percent failure , just like it was with North Korea . ”
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert on Friday compared Iran 's nuclear ambitions and threats against Israel with the policies of Nazi Germany and criticized world leaders who maintain relations with Iran 's president .
. . .
Israel has identified Iran as the greatest threat to the Jewish state .
Israel 's concerns have heightened since the election of Iran 's hard - line president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , who frequently calls for the destruction of Israel and has questioned whether the Nazi genocide of 6 million Jews took place .
" We hear echoes of those very voices that started to spread across the world in the 1930s , " Olmert said in his speech at the Yad Vashem memorial .
1979 . ”
Destabilizing Implications of Iranian - U.S. Rapproachment for Israeli and Global Security
If Iran only posed a threat to Israel , while offering new diplomatic opportunities to the U.S. and its NATO allies , then it would be possible to anticipate a threat perception gap between Jerusalem and Washington .
However , Iran 's continuing support for international terrorism through Hizbullah -- an organization with proven global reach from South America to Saudi Arabia -- and its declared interest in achieving a nuclear - strike capability demonstrates the severe hostility and broad geographic scope of involvement of the Iranian regime .
already
The American people know the difference between responsible and irresponsible debate when they see it .
They know the difference between honest critics who question the way the war is being prosecuted and partisan critics who claim that we acted in Iraq because of oil , or because of Israel , or because we misled the American people .
And they know the difference between a loyal opposition that points out what is wrong , and defeatists who refuse to see that anything is right .
would n't agree
UPDATE
Israeli interests
In his Op - Ed today , the Great Warrior Joe Lieberman predictably endorsed sending more troops to Iraq , in the process dutifully spouting ( as always ) every Bush / neoconservative talking point .
But Lieberman had a much larger fish to fry with this Op - Ed , as he all but declared war on Iran , identifying them as the equivalent of Al Qaeda , as the Real Enemy we are fighting : Everything that is happening in Iraq is the fault of Iran and Al Qaeda : Our Real Enemies on the " battlefield " in Iraq are Iran and Al Qaeda :
The real danger if we " lose " in Iraq -- if ( perish the thought ) -- is that it will enable Iran to commit still more terrorist attacks ( like all the ones they 've been sponsoring in order to kill Americans , such as 9/11 ) :
One might question why someone who is one of the most vocal advocates of the Iraq Disaster would seek to expand the war to include Iran , a country much larger and more formidable on every level than Iraq .
After all , things are n't going that well in Iraq , and it might seem to a simplistic and Chamberlain - like appeasing coward that the absolutely most insane idea ever is to try to expand " our war " to include Iran .
So what would motivate Lieberman to do this ?
Initially , it must be emphasized that whatever his reason is , it has absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with the sentiments expressed by Israel 's newest cabinet minister , Avigdor Lieberman ( whose duties include strategic affairs and Iran ) when he visited the U.S. earlier this month and gave an interview toJoe Lieberman 's desire for the U.S. to view itself as being at war with Iran also has nothing whatsoever to do with this Back in late 2001 and early 2002 , U.S. - Iranian relations were at their best state , by far , since the 1979 Islamic Revolution .
The two countries were cooperating extensively in Afghanistan .
New diplomatic channels had been created .
Iran was eager to make one concession after the next in order to achieve rapprochement with the U.S .
And foreign policy experts including Colin Powell were hailing the prospects for a new cooperative relationship with the Iranians .
In November , 2001 , Powell shook hands with the Iranian foreign minister , Kamal Kharrazi , at the U.N. headquarters in New York City .
PBS ’
Frontline described that event as “ a simple yet historic gesture that seemed the most tantalizing hint of rapprochement between the U.S. and Iran since the Islamic revolution and the hostage crisis in But also in January , 2002 , the Israelis intercepted a ship filled with mostly defensive ( though some offensive ) arms destined for the Palestinian Authority , which they claimed came from Iran .
And the Israelis began a full - scale campaign to prevent Iran - U.S. rapproachement .
By the end of that month , David Frum wrote George Bush 's State of the Union speech declaring Iran to be a charter member of the " Axis of Evil , " and relations between the two countries have been quite hostile ever since .
Even after that occurred , the Iranians continued to make extraordinary overtures to better relations , but they were all unceremoniously rejected by the Bush administration .
Sen .
Lieberman 's call for the war to include Iran has absolutely nothing to do with strategies such as those articulated by the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs in January , 2002 , in a Report entitled .
That Report warned of what it called “ multiple signs of this developing U.S. - Iranian relationship over the last three months . "
Insisting that " any Iranian - U.S. rapprochement " is " premature and potentially destabilizing , " its core strategy was clearly described :
When Sen. Lieberman warns of Iran 's " terrorist agents , " what he means , of course , are Hezbollah and Hamas , groups that are dedicated to fighting against Israel , not the U.S.
But the tactic of those who want to conflate Israel 's enemies with American enemies -- and thereby draw the U.S. into fighting those who are hostile to Israel -- is to ignore any such distinctions and to pretend that supporting anti-Israeli groups is evidence of support for the people who flew those planes into American buildings on 9/11 .
That is one of the principal deceitful tricks that was played with Saddam Hussein ( the " support for terrorism " of which he was supposedly guilty was payments to the families of Palestinians carrying out attacks against Israel , not terrorist attacks against the U.S. -- a distinction which was never made , but instead , was purposely obscured ) .
Here Sen. Lieberman is invoking the same deceitful little game to try to underhandedly suggest that Iran is an Ally of Al Qaeda and a Supporter of " the Terrorists , " purposely blurring all distinctions in the hope of driving a deeper and more hostile wedge between the U.S. and Israel 's worst enemy .
But we nonetheless must be very clear at all times that Sen.
Lieberman 's desire that the U.S. " recognize " that the war has " expanded " to include Iran has nothing whatsoever to do with the strategy by right - wing Israelis to convince the U.S. that Iran poses a threat not only to Israel but to the U.S. , so that the U.S. will act against Israel 's most formidable and threatening enemy .
Those two matters are completely unconnected -- when they converge , it is pure coincidence -- and to suggest otherwise is conclusive evidence of poisonous anti-semitism and bigotry of the worst sort .
In fact , anyone who would even raise the possibility of such a connection is engaging in the worst type of irresponsible debate , as the Leader himself instructed us earlier this year : Clearly , Sen .
Lieberman just happens to believe that it would be a really good idea for us to start a new war with Iran ( or , more accurately , to " recognize " that we are already at war with Iran and start acting like Churchillian men and fight them ) .
After all , everyone knows that Iran has invaded all sorts of countries , threatened to invade the U.S. , poses a grave risk to our sovereignty , helped plan the 9/11 attacks , is best friends with Osama bin Laden , and is ruled by madmen way beyond the realm of reason and are even building concentration camps as we speak .
What rational , brave patriotthat the U.S. should wage war against Iran ?
The only possible reason to suggest that Sen. Lieberman , in his war dances against Iran , might be driven by considerations other than American interests could only be the by - product of an ugly , bigoted mind .
Such people must be -- and most assuredly will be -- scorned with a venom reserved for few others .
Just ask Jim Baker .
Or Jimmy Carter .
What Sen. Lieberman 's Op - Ed painfully and conclusively demonstrates is that the people who brought us the war in Iraq are nowhere near done with their wretched work . :
For the sake of clarity , and to avoid being misunderstood , I want to add one point here that really merits its own separate discussion .
If I were an Israeli , I 'd very likely perceive Iran as an enemy ( and vice - versa ) .
And as I 've argued many times before , one can reasonably argue that the U.S. should have a policy of supporting its most important allies and / or other democracies , including Israel .
The U.S. provides security guarantees for all sorts of countries .
That 's all fair game for open discussion .
But few things are more threatening tothan deceitfully securing American policies based on pretext or by concealing the real agenda .
People can be fooled only for so long , and people who feel deceived generally backlash against the deceivers .
The argument is not that people like Joe Lieberman do too much to help Israel but that , though that might be their motive , they achieve the precise opposite result .
EU Presses US Before Launch Of Climate Plan
The United States is the world 's biggest single contributor to man-made global warming , accounting for a quarter of global emissions of greenhouse gases .
Bush has argued that Kyoto would hurt the US economy , and is strongly opposed to its approach of binding cuts , also called caps , in emissions .
Instead , he has promoted voluntary action , backed by some incentives for cleaner energy sources and gains in energy efficiency .
by Stephen Collinson
Washington ( AFP ) Jan 08 , 2007
European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso Monday challenged the United States to join Europe 's battle against climate change , days before the bloc is due to adopt a landmark energy plan .
Barroso said after meeting President George W. Bush that though differences remained , he sensed a growing openness within the Bush administration towards discussing global warming , despite the US refusal to ratify the Kyoto treaty .
In a preview of the EU plan due to be finalized as early as Wednesday , he said clear , binding targets on greenhouse gas emissions were required to combat global warming and set an example for emerging economies like India and China .
" I just spoke today with President Bush and we talked about climate change , so that means we all agree there is a problem , " Barroso said at a solo press conference after his White House talks , when asked whether the United States was now serious about tackling climate change .
" I see a much more open attitude , engaging attitude , regarding the need for common action globally on this matter . "
Barroso said he found Bush a " receptive interlocutor " on climate change , though noted there were still wide differences .
" Of course , we know that the American position so far has been , and it is , a position of not accepting Kyoto . "
Barroso hinted the European energy plan would include clear targets on cutting emissions .
" Having clear binding targets in terms of emissions , we believe in Europe that is important .
" It would make a big difference if the United States is clearly as committed as we are , it will make a great difference , it is not just for us , it is also ( about ) trying to engage China , India . "
Barroso declined to detail the EU plan but other EU officials here said the scheme would be the most " important and ambitious " energy plan ever adopted by the bloc .
Some media reports have said the initiative could call for cuts in emissions by 20 percent from 1990 levels by 2020 , and will include bolstered targets on energy efficiency and back more research into low carbon fuels .
The United States is the world 's biggest single contributor to man-made global warming , accounting for a quarter of global emissions of greenhouse gases .
Bush has argued that Kyoto would hurt the US economy , and is strongly opposed to its approach of binding cuts , also called caps , in emissions .
Instead , he has promoted voluntary action , backed by some incentives for cleaner energy sources and gains in energy efficiency .
In a short appearance before reporters after meeting Barroso at the White House , Bush did not mention climate change specifically , but said the two men were hopeful " use of technologies and good policy will help us diversify our energy supplies and be able to assure future generations that the environment of the world will be better off . "
Kyoto commits industrialized countries that have signed and ratified the treaty to trim greenhouse gases by 2012 , as compared with a 1990 benchmark .
It does not require larger developing countries to make these pledges , an approach that Bush says is unfair .
Some US states have implemented their own regulations , such as California , which in September mandated a 25 percent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by 2020 and sued six US and Japanese auto makers for their alleged contribution to global warming .

" Irgendwann legen die Leute den Hörer daneben " Wolf - Dieter Roth
Telefonwerbung : die Penetranz nimmt weiter zu
Absurd : Immer mehr Arbeitslose werden in durch Zuschüsse des Arbeitsamts finanzierte Callcenter gesteckt , um die , die noch Arbeit haben , von selbiger oder der Erholung am Feierabend abzuhalten .
Das Telefon als Kommunikationsmedium wird dadurch immer mehr in Frage gestellt .
Wer ohne übertragene Rufnummer anruft , bekommt bei mir schon längst keinen freundlichen Gruß mit Namensnennung mehr zu hören , wie er in Benimmbüchern und Telefontrainings empfohlen wird , da es sich bei den Anrufen mit unterdrückter Rufnummer in 90 % der Fälle um nervige Telefonwerbung handelt .
Peinlich nur , wenn dann einmal von zuhause anrufende Kollegen , der aus einer Telefonzelle anrufende Geschäftsführer , oder aber die ebenfalls nicht immer eine Rufnummer übertragende Verwandtschaft angeraunzt wird .
Und wenn es sich schon einmal um einen echten beruflichen Kontakt zu handeln scheint und man sich wortreich entschuldigt , stellt sich nach einer Weile doch heraus , dass es auch diesmal wieder einmal nur um Telefonverkauf geht .
Journalismus erfordert große Konzentration , da man einerseits hektisch herumtelefonieren und recherchieren muss , andererseits anschließend beim Artikelschreiben große Sorgfalt angesagt ist .
Spätestens in diesem Moment ist ein klingendes Telefon Gift .
Allerdings hat sich die Situation durch das Internet deutlich entspannt : Die Recherche kann bei nicht ganz so brenzligen
Themen auch per E - Mail und Web statt Telefon oder Ortstermin abgewickelt werden und auch die früher massiven Anrufe von PR - Agenturen haben sich in E - Mails verwandelt , die man zum geeigneten Zeitpunkt durchsehen kann , statt ständig bei der Arbeit unterbrochen und aus den Gedankengängen gerissen zu werden .
Selbst in unserem Beruf ist also " Das Diktat der Schwatzköppe " Vergangenheit , ebenso wie extrem erhöhter Alkohol - und Nikotinkonsum .
Ob hier ein direkter Zusammenhang besteht , wäre allerdings noch zu diskutieren .
Das Telefon selbst ist allerdings noch nicht Vergangenheit :
Es ist nach wie vor unentbehrlich , wenn etwas eilig ist , wenn eine E - Mail nicht beantwortet wird und nachgehakt werden muss , oder wenn es um etwas kompliziertere Dinge geht , bei denen die feinen Untertöne und notwendigen Zwischenfragen nur im direkten Gespräch möglich sind .
Ebenso muss ein Journalist auch heute noch telefonisch erreichbar sein .
Zu sagen " Ich gehe jetzt nicht ans Telefon , ich muss arbeiten ! “ mag in anderen Branchen durchgehen , jedoch nicht in Verkauf und Journalismus .
Der computergestützte Anrufbeantworter
Wer privat Langeweile hat und sich über einen telefonischen Spielgefährten freut , kann beispielsweise versuchen , den Telefonmarketer seinerseits auszufragen oder gar , ihm eine Versicherung zu verkaufen ( Rechtsschutz soll übrigens sehr gefragt sein ! ) .
Wer sowieso nicht zuhause ist , kann auch den computergestützten Anrufterror mit seinem eigenen Telefoncomputer beantworten , was durchaus bühnenreife Dialoge ergibt und ganze Webseiten füllt .
Doch bei der Arbeit scheiden solche Scherze leider aus : Spätestens , wenn der Personalchef anruft , wäre der Ofen aus .
Um so lästiger , wenn man dann zehnmal am Tag von Losverkäufern , Buchwerbern , Weingutbesitzern , und sogar regelrechten Betrügern unterbrochen wird .
Ähnlich wie bei E - Mail - Spam tarnen die Telefonwerber sich mittlerweile immer besser , so dass man ihre Absicht nicht mehr auf Anhieb erkennen kann , zumal , wenn man in Gedanken gerade bei einem ganz anderen Problem ist und erstmal auf den Anrufer umschalten muss .
Noch schwieriger , wenn die Anrufer bereits aus ihren Datensatz wissen , dass man Journalist ist und sich dementsprechend als Branchenkontakt tarnen .
Auf dieser Linie arbeitete unter anderem ein Weingutbesitzer , der – nachdem man ihn abwimmeln wollte – plötzlich davon anfing , man habe doch seinen Wein erst neulich auf einer Pressekonferenz bewundert und gelobt .
Die Firma , hach , den Namen habe man leider gerade vergessen , hätte auf ihrer Veranstaltung sich von diesem Weingut sponsoren lassen und daher stamme auch die Adresse .
Doch die paar Firmen , die meinen , Journalisten auch heute noch luxuriös mit Wein bewirten zu können , lassen sich dafür sicherlich nicht von irgendwelchen vom Telefonverkauf lebenden Weingütern bezahlen oder verkaufen diesen gar die Adressen der eingeladenen Teilnehmer .
Dennoch ist man erstmal verwirrt , schließlich wäre es leider nicht das erste Mal , dass ein beruflicher Kontakt die gesammelten Adressen an SKL & Co vertickt hätte .
( Wolf - Dieter Roth )
THERE ’S blood on the frost and blame in the air .
The wolves are back , hunting in the night , skulking through gardens , making the farm dogs restless .
Sleek and mystical , they have roamed through folklore and fairy tale , a bit of enticing danger at the forest ’s edge .
But Joachim Bachmann , a hunter with a wall full of trophies , is not so lyrical when it comes to the wolf ’s reappearance amid the birch and pine of the eastern woods in Saxony .
In today ’s Germany , the wolf is a “ protected species . ”
Mention these two words and you ’d better duck , because Bachmann can’t quite get his mind around how a sheep - eating machine should not be shot on sight .
It bothers him even when he sits at the big table in his big house looking out the window to a damp land speckled with paw prints .

“ What positive thing does a wolf bring to nature ?
Nothing , ” he says , cutting his schnitzel and salted potatoes .
There is something else out beyond the winter grass that perturbs him too .
Down the road , past a church and through a forest so dense it seems like walking through the bristles on a hairbrush , a woman Bachmann describes as a misguided Little Red Riding Hood charts the personalities and nocturnal habits of wolf packs .
Gesa Kluth ’s boots are muddy and her maps are worn ; to Bachmann , the biologist is an infuriatingly dedicated state - funded wolf lover .
She ’s not cooing about him either .
Kluth points to a picture on her door of a sturdy white - haired man in a hunting hat peeking out from a stand of evergreens .
It ’s Bachmann .
Advertisement
“ He ’s our No. 1 enemy .
We were thinking about getting darts to throw at it , ” she says .
Kluth spends her days and nights tracking wolves , where they sleep , play and hunt on a territory of about 115 square miles .
She plans to trap a few , fix them with radio transmitters and follow their migrations , which appear to be drifting north and west .
To her , the wolf is a stealthy , swift , misunderstood beauty .
“ The problem is that hunters see themselves as the predators who control the animal population from overpopulating , ” she says .
“ But now the wolves have returned and they are the natural predators , which threatens the hunter ’s lifestyle . ”
Wolves were hunted to near extinction in Germany in the Middle Ages .
They reappeared from time to time , between wars and other epochs that changed borders and rearranged forests .

Dozens were shot in East Germany during the Cold War .
But the demise of the communist government and the rise , after German reunification , of environmentally conscious successors have given nature a foothold on land that had been lost to warehouses and iron mills that today languish like industrial ghosts .
Wolves reappeared in this part of Saxony in the mid-1990s , when a lone male crossed the Neisse River from Poland , which has about 500 wolves .
The first German pups were born in 2000 ; today at least 25 wolves wander the forests on army training sites and hunt along the brown coal of strip mines .
A few others live to the north in Brandenburg , where their territory widened as 1.5 million people fled East Germany after the Berlin Wall fell .
Last year , a wolf believed to have wandered up from Italy was hit by a car in southern Bavaria .
Like the beast he despises , Bachmann arrived in the east after what people here call “ former times . ”
He was born in a part of Silesia that reverted to Poland after World War II .
He and his family were forced into East Germany .
They escaped in 1953 and moved to the Ruhr region of West Germany , where he eventually ran a fleet of coal trucks .
A few years before the wolves rediscovered Saxony , Bachmann built a wood house here , decorating it with an antler chandelier and mounted heads of wild boar , bison and rams .
Advertisement
He and his buddies track deer .
So do the wolves .
Bachmann is worried that the deer population will be thinned and the state will reduce quotas for hunters .
Hunting is cheaper in eastern Germany than in the west , but if wolves upset the ecosystem , hunters would have less deer meat to sell and may stop paying to use privately owned game lands .
This could suppress real estate values in a region with limited prosperity .
“ The wolf population is doubling each year , ” Bachmann says .
“ Soon we ’ll have more than 120 , and then the wild deer will be gone and the forests will be empty .
I think many of these wolf lovers orchestrated the return of the wolf .
They ’re getting paid to protect the wolf .
They use the wolf as a magnet for donations .
Look on the Internet -- you can become a ‘ wolf patron . ’ ”
The wolves in Saxony coexist with tanks and gunfire erupting from NATO and German soldiers on war game exercises in the forests .
The animals hunt at night when steam plumes from power plants streak the sky with phosphorous incandescence , and sometimes they snatch a farmer ’s sheep , bringing angry morning phone calls to Kluth , who works with another biologist and a public relations officer in a region of about 20,000 people .
“ A farmer is compensated if a wolf kills his sheep , ” says Kluth , who began her research here in 2002 .
“ But sometimes it ’s not the wolf .
It ’s a car or something else .
Many people think that anything that dies must have been killed by a wolf .
We grow up with [ fairy tales ] that wolves are wild and dangerous and we need a hunter to protect us . ”

Bachmann would n’t disagree .
“ We used to have 400 to 500 wild sheep living in these forests .
Now they ’re all gone , ” he says , estimating that there are at least 40 wolves in Saxony .
“ They even ate one of my neighbor ’s sheep .
The whole system is breaking down . ”
Bachmann ’s fellow hunter Christian Lissina says the wolves are slinking into villages and coming closer to people .
“ Until we have the first dead person , the laws wo n’t change and nothing will happen , ” Lissina said .
“ But then they ’ll come with helicopters and night - vision lenses looking for wolves . ”
The animosity between hunter and biologist is woven with science , exaggeration and folklore .
Kluth acknowledges that wolves sometimes race across lawns and dart down dark farm roads ; one wolf recently padded through a backyard garden while a woman stood a few feet away smoking a cigarette .
Kluth says there is no danger .
“ They mostly stay in the forest , ” she adds .
“ Wolves do live near cities in Italy , Romania and Spain , and if they find out how many wild boar are in Berlin , they might go there . ”

What is an iCloud Activation Lock ?
In 2014 , a quirk was added to iOS7 by Apple that altered the way iPhone accounts were integrated into the software of the phone .
This change was named iCloud Bypass Activation Lock .
This new method made to iOS 7 ( and carried through to iOS10 , iOS11 and iOS 12 ) is that your iPhone , iPad , or Apple Watch is now locked to your personal iCloud , Apple account locked .
It means that when you restart your Apple device , you iPhone iCloud Unlock by entering your iCloud username and password to access the features , functions , and files .
When you are just using your iPhone , iPad , or Apple Watch – its not a big deal .
But when you buy a used device from some random person called ‘ HighMountain77 ’ on eBay , and he forgot to remove his iCloud details or neglected to provide the credentials , your phone is essentially useless .
Literally , no use to anyone for anything .
There is n’t anything you can do .
You ca n’t jailbreak it , drain the battery nor try to reinstall the OS and wipe it clean .
Whatever you paid for it ( $ 300 ? ) is gone and left the expensive smartphone that does n’t work .
Because there were so many people who found themselves in this situation when the used iPhone market started to expand .
All these people who had legitimately bought a second - hand iPhone , iPad , or Apple Watch and could n’t use it were left without a solution .
i Phone iCloud Unlock service providers started to investigate ways to bypass the iCloud lock barrier .
After many false starts and testing different potential methods , a loophole emerged .
As a result , you can now get the iCloud activation lock removed from your iPhone , iPad or Apple Watch .
How to check to see if your phone is stolen
Try these steps first before moving onto the low cost methods using a service .
First , check to see if iPhone was stolen .
Typically , your phone is activation locked because the previous owner used both iCloud and Find My iPhone .
However , in some cases , you may have obtained a stolen iPhone .
You can check the if your iPhone was stolen on this site ( for the US ) : Free Stolen Phone Checker
For international phones , use this site : International Stolen Phone Checker
Note :
If your check confirms that the phone is stolen then Apple will not help you with unlocking it and you will need an iPhone iCloud Unlock service provider .
Also , the seller wo n’t assist either – considering they sold you stolen goods .
It is possible that eBay or the credit card company can provide purchase protection .
Then proceed to the Low Cost – iPhone iCloud Unlock Services .
How to Unlock iCloud for free - if you can reach the previous owner ?
If the owner is physically near you , follow the directions below :
Ask the previous owner to enter their Apple ID account credentials on the iPhone .
When the phone gets to the home screen , they should sign out .
On iOS 10.2 and earlier , proceed to Settings > iCloud > Sign Out .
On iOS 10.3 and later , proceed to Settings > [ your name ] >
Sign Out
When asked for Apple credentials , they should re-enter the credentials iOS 10.2 and earlier , tap Sign Out , then tap Delete from My iPhone iOS 10.3 and up , tap Turn Off Erase the phone again by going to Settings > General > Reset > Erase All Content and Settings
When the phone restarts this time , you should n’t see the Activation Lock screen .
If the owner is not physically near you , follow the following steps :
Ask them to sign in .
with their username and password at iCloud.com which was used to activate the phone .
Choose Find My iPhone .
Select All Devices , then select the iPhone that needs to be unlocked .
Choose Erase iPhone .
Choose Remove from Account .
Once removed from their previosuly Apple account locked , you can restart the iPhone .
At this point , you wo n’t see the Activation Lock screen when it starts up .
Low cost – iPhone unlock iCloud services
It was the wild west with all the new unlock providers jumping into the market .
You could not tell who was legitimate and truly had the experience to unlock you iCloud account versus the many scam providers .
I personally was scammed a few times .
This experience motivated me to test the various providers to find ones who were reliable and safe to work with .
You ca n’t get certified in evaluating methods and vendors who can bypass the iCloud lock .
So , I ’m just as qualified to tell you about iCloud activation unlock as any other person on the street .
However , there is one thing that makes me more of an expert than anyone else : testing .
Our team assessed and evaluated 9 different providers and tested 3 of them on all active iPhone models .
And the simple fact that I ’ve actually tested these providers with all models makes me the expert in the space .
There are other reviews available but most of them have never reviewed even one carrier , let alone reviewed all nine .
That ’s why I ’m qualified to talk about the top iPhone iCloud Unlock service providers .
Click here to skip testing methodology and go straight to the reviews

This service works on all iPhone 7 , 7 plus , 6 , 6 plus , 5S , 5C , 5 , 4S , 4 and iPad 4 , 3 , 2 Air 2 .
Test methodology for removing iCloud Lock
The way I conducted these tests was simple .
First of all , I Googled iCloud unlock providers and drew up a list of everyone I could find .
After removing services that did n’t look like they were still active , I was left with nine services .
The next step in the process was to cull that list down from nine operators to my top three .
I wanted my test of each operator to be comprehensive and complete and it was n’t possible to rigorously test all 9 operators .
To do this , I jumped onto review websites such as TrustPilot and RipoffReport to weed out any obviously dodgy operators .
I read the reviews and tallied up the average score of each service provider giving me an average score for each .
I cut the lowest scoring six services and was left with three to test .
To make sure I had enough devices to thoroughly test each provider , I put the call out to all my readers to get iPhones that need unlocking .
I wanted to get people in a variety of countries and using a variety of models ( as I did at the time I tested how to unlock i Phone5 ) .
Of the 73 who responded , I chose 12 to test ( 12 for each provider ) :
1x iPhone 11 ;
1x iPhone 11 Max ;
1 x iPhone X ;
1 x iPhone XS ;
1 x iPhone XS Max ;
1 x iPhone 8 ;
1 x iPhone 7 ;
1 x iPhone 7 Plus ;
1 x iPhone 6 ;
1 x iPhone 6s Plus ;
1 x iPad Pro 2019 ;
1 x iPad Air .
The chosen applicants then sent me their IMEI codes and I placed the orders .
How to unlock iCloud account – testing criteria
The iCloud providers were judged based on 4 criteria :
Price
Price range varied greatly between providers .
Some were as little as $ 15 whilst others were as much as $ 149 .
There are very few people on this earth who can purchase services without being price conscious so this is where we started our assessment .
Customer service
Handing over your device details and a chunk of cash to an unknown website to perform a service you know very little about can be a little nerve - wracking , but having a supportive and understanding person on the other end of the customer support line can help calm those nerves .
We tested each service provider three times during the course of the unlocking process :
Before the purchase
After the purchase but before the unlock was complete After the unlock iCloud service was complete
This was to get a comprehensive understanding of who was really there to help and who was there just to take your money .
Success
What the point in great prices and caring customer support if they can deliver on what they promised ?
Because of this , the third criteria is : success .
It ’s a simple pass / fail criteria .
If the Apple account locked is now unlocked , it was a success .
If not , then no .
Speed
Getting your iCloud account unlocked is great , but waiting can be frustrating .
To compare apples to apples , we did n’t assess the sites on how long they said it would take to understand how to Unlock iCloud account , just how long it actually took to unlock them .
After processing all of this data , we can confidently say that the following two providers are the best .
Top 2 iPhone iCloud Unlock Service Providers

# 2
AppleiPhoneUnlock – 9.5/10 ( Best IMEI Based Unlocking Provider )
They are my second # 1 choice on how to unlock iCloud account .
We ’ve tested them based on the above four criteria and they came out top in all four .
PROs :
First of all , they unlocked every device we sent them .
They were assigned versions of iPads and iPhone models from 6 to XS to unlock and completed every single one of them ( the only one to do so ) .
That ’s always a good place to start .
Secondly , they unlocked them all quickly .
The total time for completing all twelve iPhones was only a TOTAL of 24 days .
This is the breakdown :
1 x iPhone X – 2 days
1 x iPhone XS – 2 days
1 x iPhone XS Max – 2 days
1 x iPhone 8 – 3 days
1 x iPhone 7 – 2 days
1 x iPhone 7 Plus – 2 days
1 x iPhone 6 – 1 day
1 x iPhone 6 Plus – 2 days
1 x iPhone 6s – 2 days
1 x iPhone 6s Plus – 1 day
1 x iPad Pro 2018 – 3 days
1 x iPad Air – 2 days
When you consider that most iCloud unlock providers take at least a week , this is stellar .
Thirdly , their customer support rocks .
I contacted them before , during , and after the service was completed and the most I ever had to wait to hear back was forty - five minutes .
And even better than that , when I did contact them , they were polite , helpful , and answered my questions completely .
And finally , they ’re the cheapest of the bunch .
They might only be $ 1 cheaper than our # 2 recommendation , but we live in a world where every dollar counts and it ’s better to have it in your pocket than someone else ’s !
CONs :
Unfortunately , there ’s nothing really to write here .
I try to make my reviews as unbiased and even - handed as possible and I do n’t have anything to add right now .
Could their customer support have responded in less than 45 minutes ?
Sure , they could have , but it would n’t have made that much difference .
Could they have unlocked all the Apple account locked in less time ?
Possibly , but it would n’t have made that much difference .
Without nit-picking for the sake of it , there ’s nothing to really add here .
OVERALL :
AppleiPhoneUnlock was the only provider to unlock all 6 accounts and because of that , they ’re my # 1 choice .
And if that was n’t enough , they have great customer service , the cheapest prices ( even if it ’s only by $ 1 ) , and they ’re the fastest of the group .
# 3
IMEIDoctor – 8.5/10 ( An Alternative IMEI iCloud Unlock Service )
IMEIDoctor is my third choice .
Not because they ’re a terrible iPhone iCloud Unlock service provider , but simply because they ’re not as good as AppleiPhoneUnlock .
PROs :
IMEIDoctor mostly do what they say they ’re going to do .
I purchased 12 iCloud unlocks and they managed to unlock 11 of them .
11 out of 12 is n’t bad when you consider that most providers have less than a 50 % success rate , but it ’s still not 8 out of 8 .
The total time it took for the how to unlock iCloud process was longer than advertised ( 30 days total ) , but they still delivered .
Here ’s a breakdown of how long it took to unlock each Apple account locked .
1 x iPhone X – 3 days
1 x iPhone XS – 2 days
1 x iPhone XS Max – 3 days
1 x iPhone 8 – 3 days
1 x iPhone 7 – 4 days
1 x iPhone 7 Plus – 2 days
1 x iPhone 6 – 2 day
1 x iPhone 6 Plus – 2 days
1 x iPhone 6s – 3 days
1 x iPhone 6s Plus – 1 day
1 x iPad Pro 2018 – 3 days
1 x iPad Air – N / A
Their customer support is efficient and will answer your questions , but it might take a few days .
And as I said above , they ’re only $ 1 more expensive than AppleiPhoneUnlock .
CONs :
Firstly , they failed to unlock the Apple account locked .
Yes , they gave us a refund straight away , but they still failed to deliver .
Secondly , their unlock times are a slower as well .
AppleiPhoneUnlock was unlocking iCloud accounts in 1 - 2 days , these guys are more like 3 - 4 days .
It ’s not a HUGE issue , but it ’s still twice as long to wait without a phone you ’ve already paid for .
And finally , whilst their customer support responded in a few days , their responses were always curt and specific .
There was nothing in the email other than the only information they needed to answer the question .
Whilst they technically did their job , it was very cold and clinical .
OVERALL :
IMEIDoctor is a solid provider and there ’s a better - than - average chance your Apple account locked will now be unlocked , but why take the risk when AppleiPhoneUnlock are more reliable and cheaper ?

The very purpose of creating iCloud was to not only drive users towards the safer , reliable , and profitable cloud storage platform .

Since Apple locks down your iDevice to the Apple ID and password , this ensures that in the unfortunate event of you losing the device , your content is not compromised .
Hence , officially speaking , you cannot unlock iCloud without password .
However , that ’s when third - party iCloud activation services come into play , understanding that it might not always be possible for users to get a hold of the Apple ID password .
If you have purchased a used iPhone or iPad , and no longer are in contact with the original owner , the only way around the iCloud activation lock is the ability to pay up a small fee for the unlock code from third - party iPhone unlocking service providers that we have mentioned in the guide above .

IN A BRILLIANT lecture at the University of Regensburg last week , Pope Benedict XVI made three crucial points that are now in danger of being lost in the polemics about his supposedly offensive comments about Islam .
The pope ’s first point was that all the great questions of life , including social and political questions , are ultimately theological .
How we think ( or do n’t think ) about God has much to do with how we judge what is good and what is wicked , and with how we think about the appropriate methods for advancing the truth in a world in which there are profound disagreements about the truth of things .
If , for example , we imagine that God is pure will , a remote majesty with whom our only possible relationship is one of unthinking submission , then we have imagined a God who can even command what seems to be irrational -- like the murder of innocents .
Pope Benedict reminds us , however , that mainstream Christian tradition , following its Jewish parent , has a different concept of God .
The God of Abraham , Moses and Jesus is a God of reason , compassion and love , a God who comes searching for man in history , appeals to the human mind as well as the human heart and invites human beings into a dialogue of salvation .
This God cannot demand the unreasonable or the irrational .
This God ’s revelation of himself , in the Hebrew Bible and the Christian New Testament , does not cancel out or abrogate human reason .
That is why mainstream Christianity has always taught that human beings can build decent societies by attending to reason .
Advertisement
The pope ’s second point , which flows from the first , was that irrational violence aimed at innocent men , women and children “ is incompatible with the nature of God and the nature of the [ human ] soul . ”
If adherents of certain currents of thought in contemporary Islam insist that the suicide bombing of innocents is an act pleasing to God , then they must be told that they are mistaken : about God , about God ’s purposes and about the nature of moral obligation .
Responsibility for challenging these distorted views of God and the distorted understanding of moral duty that flows from them rests , first , with Islamic leaders .
But too few Islamic leaders , the pope seemed to suggest , have been willing to undertake a cleansing of Islam ’s conscience -- as Pope John Paul II taught the Catholic Church to cleanse its historical conscience .
We know that , in the past , Christians used violence to advance Christian purposes .
The Catholic Church has publicly repented of such distortions of the Gospel and has developed a deep theological critique of the misunderstandings that led to such episodes .
Can the church , therefore , be of some help to those brave Islamic reformers who , at the risk of their own lives , are trying to develop a parallel Islamic critique of the distorted and lethal ideas of some of their co-religionists ?
By quoting from a robust exchange between a medieval Byzantine emperor and a learned Islamic scholar , Benedict XVI was not making a cheap rhetorical point ; he was trying to illustrate the possibility of a tough - minded but rational dialogue between Christians and Muslims .
That dialogue can only take place , however , on the basis of a shared commitment to reason and a mutual rejection of irrational violence in the name of God .
Advertisement
The pope ’s third point -- which has been almost entirely ignored -- was directed to the West .
If the West ’s high culture keeps playing in the sandbox of postmodern irrationalism -- in which there is “ your truth ” and “ my truth ” but nothing such as “ the truth ” -- the West will be unable to defend itself .
Why ?
Because the West wo n’t be able to give reasons why its commitments to civility , tolerance , human rights and the rule of law are worth defending .
A Western world stripped of convictions about the truths that make Western civilization possible cannot make a useful contribution to a genuine dialogue of civilizations , for any such dialogue must be based on a shared understanding that human beings can , however imperfectly , come to know the truth of things .
CAN ISLAM BE self - critical ?
Can its leaders condemn and marginalize its extremists , or are Muslims condemned to be held hostage to the passions of those who consider the murder of innocents to be pleasing to God ?
Can the West recover its commitment to reason and thus help support Islamic reformers ?
These are the large questions that Pope Benedict XVI has put on the world ’s agenda .
Men and women of reason and goodwill should be very glad that he has done so .

Make sure it has at least 3 / 4 tang though , any less and the balance might feel weird ( you do n't feel like you 're holding the knife ; it feels like your holding a handle that 's holding the knife ... ) , constant use of over the years could result in loosening of the blade from the handle , or it might just fall out if you use too much force .
Forged - Stainless steel knifes are generally forged or stamped .
Forged knives are typically more durable and are usually thicker ( more structural support ) .
I like my chef 's knives to be forged and my bread knife to be stamped ( because stamped is thin and cheap ) .
You can get all forged , but it will cost more ( a nice forged slicer will also be thin , but will be pricey compared to a stamped version ) .
The forged ones are reputed to hold an edge longer as well .
I 'll take this opportunity to point out that some companies like J.A.
Henckels have started to do a composite stamp / forge which they claim makes their knives better than plain forged .
Basic metallurgy tells us that it 's probably not true , but personally I like the feel of their knives and have n't had any complaints about durability or cutting ability .
Diamond edges -
Some knives advertise " never need sharpening " due to a diamond coated edge ( or something like that ) .
I would recommend against these knives because they do eventually get dull and you can't sharpen them .
Same with ceramic knives - you have to send them back to the factory for sharpening .
Serrated edges -
Some knives are serrated .
That 's fine .
Some chef 's knives are serrated .
That 's not fine .
Serrated knives cut by tearing .
This is fine for some foods ( breads and cakes ) but not for food preparation .
A sharp smooth edge works better than a serrated edge - just remember to use a slicing action instead of pushing down through the ingredient ( chopping ) .
Remember , we 're cutting , not sawing .
Either Chinese cleaver or Santoku

The chef 's knife is the one knife that is consistently rated as the single most essential in the kitchen .
However , if I could only pick one knife to have in the kitchen , it would be a Chinese or Asian cleaver .
This knife 's sharp edge is thin enough and sharp enough to easily cut and mince food and at the same time strong enough to handle light cleaving jobs .
The side of the blade can be used to smash garlic and ginger and the top edge san be used ( with care ) as a meat tenderizer .
The broad blade is often used to move food from the cutting board to the stove .
However , due to the overall shape and size of a Chinese Cleaver , there is not as much precision as a chef 's knife .
Since I have a full compliment of knives , my Chinese cleaver sits on the sidelines waiting for the day when I can only have one knife to use .
The most versatile knife in the western kitchen is the chef 's knife .
It is used for cutting , slicing , chopping , and mincing .
The curved blade allows rocking back and forth for fine chopping and mincing .
Chef 's knives come in blade lengths from 6 to 12 inches .
The longer the knife , the more you can cut , but the more difficult it is to control .
If you 've got small hands ( like I do ) , you may want to stick with the 6 to 8 in . variety .
Tina uses a 6 in .
while I find the 8 in .
allows me to grip the knife just forward of the bolster with my forefinger and thumb without discomfort ( the 6 in . is slimmer so the back of the knife digs into the side of my knuckle ) .
If you 've got one of these and a board scraper , you wo n't need or want to use an Asian cleaver .
This is the Japanese equivalent of a chef 's knife and has been gaining in popularity in Western kitchens .
It has a broad blade and a tip that is lower than a chef 's tip .
Typically made thinner than a chef 's knife , it does not have as much structural strength or weight , but is great at all chef 's knife functions except for cutting through bone .
Many brands now carry santokus , but a few have made poor design decisions ( edge is almost flat , tip too low , knife too thick , etc. ) .
The Shun Classic Santoku shown here is probably the best santoku on the market right now .
Unfortunately , for left handers , it 's a right handed knife ( the unique D crosssection handle fits right handers ) .
The paring knife is great for working a blade in a small space .
Paring apples , cutting fruits , butterflying shrimp , and seeding a jalapeno are just some of the tasks the paring knife is well suited for .
The paring knife has a thin blade that makes it easy to manuever while cutting .
The sharp tip is also useful for removing potato eyes and other such tasks .
In general , a paring knife is simply a miniature chef 's knife - designed with the same curves and angles but smaller .
This makes switching between the chef 's knife and the paring knife a natural action .
A carving knife 's special purpose is to carve poultry , roasts , and hams after they have been cooked .
Carvers typically have points to reach into tight places , but roast beef carvers have blunt ends .
Some have hollow recesses along their blades and are referred to as granton or hollow edged or scallops .
These air pockets allow for thinner slicing because they prevent meat slices from adhering to the blade .
Why use a slicer instead of a chef 's knife ?
Thickness .
A carving knife is much thinner , enabling the knife to slice through finely while a thicker knife will wedge and tear the cooked meat once it cuts in too deep .
A bread knife 's job in life is to cut , you guessed it , bread .
Many breads have a hard crust which keeps a slicer or chef 's knife from digging in and gripping the bread when you start to cut .
You can use the tip of the chef 's knife to punch a hole where you want to cut and then slice , but what about soft breads ?
With soft breads , the chef 's knife does n't clip around on the crust , but while you cut into the bread , you compress it instead of slicing clean through .
A bread knife solves both problems by providing large serrations that grip the crust and can saw through soft breads without squishing them .
This knife is also useful for cutting dense cakes ( yellow cakes , pound cakes ) , but use a fine serrated knife for light cakes ( angel food cake ) .
This knife is the in - between knife .
If you 've got a 4 in .
paring and a 10 in .
chef's , you might want a 6 in .
utility knife for all those jobs in between .
Sometimes it's also called a tomato knife ( usually when it has medium serrations ) or a sandwich knife .
Since Tina uses a 6 in .
chef 's knife , I use that instead .
This thin knife allows you to remove membranes from meat and meat from bones easily .
Usually , it is made thin enough for the blade to be a little flexible .
Typically , this will be the sharpest knife you own because it will also be the thinnest knife .
Use this to cut anything soft that needs fine precision work , but do n't cut semi - frozen meat with this blade ( use a chef 's knife for that ) .
The Victorinox or RH Forschner brand boning knife with Fibrox handle is probably the best boning knife available and is 1/5 the cost of most high end knives .
This model goes for $ 10 and the handle does n't get slippery when coated with juice and membrane from the poultry you 're working on .
This knife is used to hack pieces of meat with bone apart .
Usually imprecise due to the amount of force you need to use , the meat cleaver sections meat pretty well .
I suggest using a seperate cutting board because you 'll probably cut into the board a bit .
In western cooking , there will be very little need for this knife because most of the time we trim the meat off the bones .
When quartering a chicken , a boning knife is used and we avoid cutting through bone ( unless we 're doing it Asian style where having slivers of bone is part of the look and feel ) .
Most of the time the butcher handles the bone cutting for us with their rotary and band saws ( which produce much cleaner cuts than a meat cleaver ) .
This is the knife your guests will use to tear cooked meat into bit sized chunks .
It 's usually best to have large pieces of cooked meat served whole to preserve the juices and have your guests cut them .
A steak knife does not cut meat as much as it tears very finely .
What to look for in knives ?
Here 's a short list of stuff people usually tell you what to look for :
So what 's the final verdict ?
Here we go : Buying 1 knife onlyBuying 2 knivesBuying 3 knivesBuying 4 knivesHow about buying a knife set ?
It depends .
Most of the time knife sets come with one or two good knives and the rest are not so good ( that 's why they put it in a set ) .
Often you 're better off buying the knives individually and as you need them instead of all at one time .
You would n't have to have them on for 24 though ...
If we ever get that voice recognition thing down or some other convenient means of turning off the lights when nobody 's home we could have em on only for the 8 hours or so we are awake ...
Hell I 'm only in my kitchen for about 2 hours a day ...
The BBC has a long and glorious past as a technological innovator .
Throughout the history of broadcasting , it has often been the first to develop and promote new technologies .
Sadly , it seems now to be teetering on the brink of making technical choices that will not only damage its own reputation as a world - class institution , but which will also have serious knock - on consequences for free software .
As the worlds of computing and media began increasingly to overlap , it was inevitable that the BBC would need to make decisions about which formats and licensing schemes it would adopt for digital versions of its content that were delivered over the Internet .
To begin with , it offered RealMedia streams for its Audio on Demand service , which meant that GNU / Linux users were on an equal footing with those running Windows .
Even more promising was the BBC 's participation in the Creative Archive project .
This was set up in April 2005 by the BBC and several other major UK institutions to make archive video and audio material available under the Creative Archive licence , which was based on the Creative Commons licences .
As well as offering liberal licensing terms , the Creative Archive also chose to release the material in a variety of formats - Quicktime , Windows Media and MPEG1 - to promote the widest possible use .
Against this background , then , the hopes were obviously high that the BBC 's latest foray into Internet broadcasting , its on - demand service that would allow people to download television and radio programmes after they were broadcast , would continue this even - handed approach and support all computer platforms .
But the current recommendations contain a real shocker , a consequence of the fact that the BBC has decided to use DRM in its new iPlayer software to control how on - demand material is viewed .
That 's bad enough , if understandable given the hideously complicated situation concerning the rights to the material that the BBC wants to make available .
But worse is how it has decided to implement this approach .
As the report explains :
the files would require DRM to ensure that they were appropriately restricted in terms of time and geographic consumption .
The only system that currently provides this security is Windows Media 10 and above .
Further , the only comprehensively deployed operating system that currently supports Windows Media Player 10 and above is the Windows XP operating system .
As a result of these DRM requirements the proposed BBC iPlayer download manager element therefore requires Windows Media Player 10 and Windows XP .
Only those running Windows XP ( or Vista ) and Windows Media Player 10 will be able to access the BBC 's proposed on - demand service .
Users of GNU / Linux ( and the Apple Macintosh for that matter ) are to be cast into the outer darkness .
That 's around 25 % of the potential audience according to this BBC podcast , which contains a fascinating discussion of many of the key issues around this decision .
From this it also emerges that the reason that the BBC felt obliged to take this route was because “ doing something is better than doing nothing
900 MHz Magnet at Florida State University National High Magnetic Field Laboratory .
Courtesy of NHMFL , Florida State University , Tallahassee , Fla .
Research performed by a team at Florida State University 's National High Magnetic Field Laboratory suggests that the benefits of building higher - field superconducting magnets likely will far outweigh the costs of building them .
FSU researchers Riqiang Fu , Ozge Gunaydin - Sen and Naresh Dalal discovered something they were n't expecting while trying to improve the resolution , or quality of image , in the magnet lab 's unique 900 - megahertz , 21.1 - tesla magnet .
While experimenting with the giant magnet , the three noted an exponential increase in the ease of detecting the " fingerprint " of the chemical compound they were studying as they exposed it to ever - higher magnetic fields .
A paper describing their research was published recently in the Journal of the American Chemical Society .
" This paper has very strong implications for the United States staying ahead in magnet technology , which would bring great dividends in research and improvements in medical imaging , " said Tim Cross , director of the magnet lab 's NMR User Program and a professor of chemistry and biochemistry at FSU .
" We need - and are working on - additional fundamental studies that show the benefits of going to higher fields . "
Nuclear magnetic resonance , or NMR , generates a true - to - life fingerprint - a unique pattern indicating the presence of specific molecules - for a research sample that is being analyzed .
As a technique , NMR is very accurate as long as one can detect the sample in the first place .
The ease or difficulty of detecting a sample is known as " sensitivity . "
Low sensitivity has been one of NMR 's biggest liabilities , because the lower the sensitivity , the longer the experiment takes .
Such slowness has limited NMR 's potential applications .
" Poor signal is like a faint picture in the darkness , " said Dalal , the Dirac Professor of Chemistry and Biochemistry at FSU .
" We 've shown that the '900 ' ( magnet ) increases the picture 's brightness by a factor of about 10 relative to low - field images .
Think of how much more you can see in a room that is that much brighter ... and imagine what you 'd see at even higher fields . "
Theorists had predicted a linear increase in both resolution and sensitivity at higher magnetic fields , moving from 14.1 tesla to 21.1 tesla , the current state of the art in superconducting magnets .
In their experiment , the FSU team members observed an exponential increase - with the sensitivity increasing by a factor of three over what had been predicted .
Higher sensitivity in a magnet means it takes far less time - or much less of a sample - to conduct an experiment .
" The reduction in time is like going from one hour to a couple of minutes , " said Fu , an associate scholar / scientist at the magnet lab and the FSU chemistry department .
" Many experiments take weeks , and such a reduction in time will allow for far more studies to be conducted on a single instrument . "
Dalal said the shortening of experimental time increases scientists ' ability to fingerprint materials , opening up new areas of scientific investigation in NMR , including the study of materials useful in nanotechnology and medical imaging .
The need for less of a sample - up to 18 times less - will open up high - field NMR to the study of enzymes and purified proteins , an area in which samples typically are of limited size .

A British study suggests the Roman Catholic Church - approved " rhythm method " may kill more embryos than other methods of contraception .
The " rhythm method " relies on abstinence during the most fertile period of a woman 's menstrual cycle .
For women who have regular 28 - day cycles , that occurs around days 10 to 17 of the cycle .
It 's believed the method works by preventing conception from occurring .
But Professor Luc Bovens of the London School of Economics says it may owe much of its success to the fact that embryos conceived on the fringes of the fertile period are less viable than those conceived toward the middle .
Bovens says it can be calculated that two to three embryos will have died every time the rhythm method results in a pregnancy .
Bovens cites anti-abortion rights activists who equate global oral contraceptive use to chemical abortion that is responsible for tens of thousands of deaths of embryos , or unborn children , every year .
But , says Bovens , if all oral contraceptive users converted to the rhythm method , they would be effectively causing the deaths of millions of embryos .
The study appears in the Journal of Medical Ethics .

Microsoft on Wednesday released a list of 800 applications it has officially verified so far to run bug - free on Windows Vista .
The list is notable for both its brevity and the absence of many applications popular on Windows XP , although Microsoft and analysts said that the majority of XP software can run , albeit with hiccups , on Vista .
Note :
After this article posted , a PC World editor verified that vital drivers are still not available for the operating system .
Read " Vista Drivers MIA " for details .
-- Editor
Popular Windows software that is conspicuously missing from Microsoft 's list includes Adobe Systems 's entire line of graphics and multimedia software , Symantec Corp .'s security products , as well as the Mozilla Foundation 's open - source Firefox Web browser , Skype 's free voice - over - IP software , and the OpenOffice.org alternative to Microsoft Office .
Software that has been tested as part of Microsoft 's Vista certification program to run on all 32 - and 64 - bit versions of Vista include CorelDraw and WordPerfect from Corel , PowerDVD from Cyberlink , Nero 7 Premium , Trend Micro AntiVirus and PC - Cillin , AutoCad 2008 , QuickBooks 2007 from Intuit , Microsoft Office 2007 and many other Microsoft applications .
In addition , Google 's Desktop Search and its Toolbar for Internet Explorer have earned Microsoft 's approval .
Missing From the List
Windows ' extensive software ecosystem has long been one of the operating system 's chief attractions .
But Vista 's long beta program last year allowed users to start compiling their own lists of applications that they claimed were broken or problematic on Vista .
Many of those were graphics - intensive games , which was the result of a new rendering engine , DirectX 10 , introduced for Vista .
But there are also a number of business and utility applications that have not been updated to ensure Vista compatibility .
For instance , the latest version of Skype does n't work on Vista .
Firefox does work , though Mozilla has documented known issues .
Most of Adobe 's multimedia software wo n't be officially supported for Vista until the middle of this year , though many applications can run today with minor problems ( download Adobe 's explanatory PDF ) .
Adobe , which will face competition from Microsoft this year when Microsoft releases its suite of graphics and multimedia design tools , did not immediately return a request to comment .
Symantec is already facing similar competition from Microsoft , which released its OneCare security suite last year .
In statements on its Web site aimed at business and home users , Symantec said some of its software , such as Norton AntiVirus 2007 , already works with Vista .
Other Symantec software , such as Ghost 12 , wo n't be ready until mid-April .
Microsoft 's Vista testing program , which vendors must pay to be a part of , has two levels : software that is " certified for Windows Vista " and software that " works with Windows Vista . "
At the moment , 108 applications have been certified , while 683 have been awarded the " works with " distinction .
ArcSoft got six of its more - popular multimedia applications certified because of demand from its hardware partners , according to Michael Downs , vice president of marketing and business development at the Fremont , Calif . - based company .
Most of ArcSoft 's software is bundled with DVD - ROM drives and other accessories from third - party resellers .
They " were requesting certification from us " so they could " slap that sticker on the [ retail ] box , " said Downs .
Downs said the certification process was fairly rigorous and involved filling out a lengthy application that was double - checked by a third - party service , VeriTest , on behalf of Microsoft .
The cost for testing ArcSoft 's six applications was less than $ 10,000 each , Downs said .
ArcSoft plans to have most of its applications tested .
For others , ArcSoft plans to wait until the next update of the software before releasing and testing a Vista version .
Benefits of Certification
Microsoft said that getting certified will bring marketing benefits to software , such as a listing on Microsoft 's Windows Marketplace site and the ability to use the logo on packaging and publicity materials .
How much would that boost sales for a company like ArcSoft ?
" It 's hard to tell , " Downs said .
Michael Silver , a Gartner analyst , said that because of the cost and time involved , " a lot of vendors do n't participate " in Microsoft 's program .
For companies that tend to run both off - the - shelf software as well as custom applications written in - house , Silver said that the percentage of applications with problems on Vista runs as high as 50 percent in some companies but is less than 10 percent in others .
While many of those problematic applications wo n't need to be replaced , he said , " there 's a good chance for disappointment for people that are n't careful . "

Den Traumfrauen der 50er Jahre war die Retrospektive in diesem Jahr gewidmet .
In den anderen Festivalreihen waren aber vor allemzu erleben .
So etwa im wohl am schwersten erträgliche Film des Wettbewerbs , " Der freie Wille " , der einen nötigte , fast drei Stunden in nächster Nähe eines Vergewaltigers zuzubringen .
Und Verständnis zu entwickeln für einen Mann , der Untaten begeht und gegen sie nicht ankommt .
Der Film hat das Publikum gespalten , in diejenigen , die es für seine Qualität hielten , dass er hinsah , wo man nicht hinsehen will ; und in die , die lieber nicht hinsehen wollten .
Obwohl " Der freie Wille " kein großes
Werk ist , allzu schwerfällig manchmal und um etliche Szenen zu lang , war er doch , vor allem seiner Hauptdarsteller Sabine Timoteo und Jürgen Vogel wegen , einer der eindrücklichsten Beiträge zum in diesem Jahr sehr schwachen Wettbewerb .
Die Jury hatLeistung mit einem silbernen Bären honoriert , für seinen künstlerischen Beitrag als Produzent , Koautor und Hauptdarsteller .
Auf der Pressekonferenz beantwortete er die Frage " Wann ist ein Mann ein Mann ? " ohne philosophische Fisimatenten : Man wird geboren , als Junge , und wächst dann heran .
Irgendwann ist man ein Mann .
Lange folgt man im argentinischen Film " El Custodio " einem Mann , der kaum spricht .
Er ist nicht mehr als der Schatten eines Politikers , für dessen Sicherheit zuständig .
Man sieht nicht viel von der
Welt in diesem Film , denn man sieht nur , was der Leibwächter erlebt .
Das ist vor allem bedrückend und summiert sich zu einer
Welt in Abhängigkeit und in Ausschnitten , aber nicht zu einem eigenen Leben .
präsentiert diesen Mann und das , was er tut , ohne den mindesten Glamour , unter Verzicht auf Spannung und Variation .
Für diese formal strenge , aber überzeugende Übung gab es , ganz zu Recht , den Alfred - Bauer - Preis für Innovation im Filmsprachlichen .
Die Jury hatte , angesichts der zum größten
Teil furchbar konventionellen Filme im Wettbewerb , kaum eine andere Wahl .
Eine Frau dominiert im neusten Werk des Altmeisters , was aber nicht heißt , dass es nicht um schreckliche Männer geht .
Isabelle Huppert nimmt es als Untersuchungsrichterin mit Politikern auf , die als bis ins Mark korrupt zu zeichnen Chabrol ein Vergnügen ist .
" L'Ivresse du pouvoir " ist den Geschehnissen um den Elf - Aquitaine - Skandal recht detailgetreu nachgebildet und war der stärkste unter den drei in den Wettbewerb geladenen Filmen alter Herren.versuchte sich in " A Prairie Home Companion " an einer Hommage an Garrison Keillors gleichnamige Live - Radioshow .
Nach virtuosem Beginn wird das Problem des Films schnell offensichtlich : Altman ist ein scharfer und gnadenloser Beobachter eitler Betriebsamkeiten .
Am Liebenswerten , um das es sich hier handelt , verliert er rasch das Interesse .
Und überAlterswerk " Find Me Guilty " hüllt man lieber gleich den Mantel des Schweigens .
Gefeiert wird , und zwar elend zäh und ohne jede Ambivalenz , ein vulgärer Mafioso ( Vin Diesel als arg limitierter Charakterdarsteller ) , und zwar für die Ganovenehre , mit der er zu seinen kriminellen Kumpanen hält .
Ein Film , der das Recht nicht kritisiert , sondern schlicht und einfach verachtet .
Unter den vier deutschen Wettbewerbsfilmen hatteVerfilmung der misogyn - zynischen " Elementarteilchen " des Franzosendie meisten Erwartungen auf sich gezogen .
Der Film erwies sich als übler Rohrkrepierer , an dem einfach gar nichts stimmte .
Als Verfilmung verfehlte Roehler - von Bernd Eichinger unterstützt - das Weltbild der Vorlage ums Ganze , gönnte den männlichen Elendsgestalten , die hier als Helden figurieren , gar eine Art Happy - End .
Und als Film sind die " Elementarteilchen " so geistlos und plump inszeniert , dass man sich an die schlimmen Zeiten deutscher Zeitgeistkomödien erinnert fühlt .erhielt als Darsteller des sexbesessenen Bruno einen Silbernen Bären .
Ein schlechter Witz , der denen des Films in nichts nachsteht .
Der silberne
Bär für die Schauspielerinist da schon besser nachzuvollziehen , denn sie bestreitet Hans - Christian Schmids " Requiem " fast alleine - meist in Großaufnahme , gepeinigt von Dämonen .
Man kann nur hoffen , dass sie beim nächsten Mal nicht nur in der Mimik , sondern auch in den Dialogen überzeugen darf .
Wie gut deutsche Filme sein können , bewies im Wettbewerb vor allembrandenburgische Dorftragödie " Sehnsucht " .
Sie erzählt , vor Ort und mit Laiendarstellern , von einem Mann zwischen zwei Frauen .
Einem Mann , der nicht weiß , wie ihm geschieht , der auch nicht die Worte hat , zu sagen , was er eventuell will .
Nicht nur , wie Grisebach ihre Darsteller zu überzeugenden Leistungen treibt , macht die Qualität dieses Films aus .
Er ist auch mit einem Formbewusstsein erzählt , das den meisten der ausgewählten Wettbewerbsbeiträge schmerzlich abgeht .
Die oft gepriesene Einfachheit von " Sehnsucht " ist eigentlich alles andere als das .
Dahinter steht nämlich eine raffinierte Genauigkeit , in der Wahl des Erzählten wie des Ausgelassenen , im Blick auf den Alltag und in den zum großen Teil alles andere als improvisierten Dialogen .
Zu dieser von großer filmischer Intelligenz geprägten neuen Schule des deutschen Kinos gehörten auch die Forumsbeiträge " Montag kommen die Fenster " vonund " Lucy " vonsowieTürkei-Dokumentarfilm " Aus der Ferne " .
Dass " Sehnsucht " bei der Vergabe der Preise leer ausging , ist der bedauerlichste Aspekt der von der Jury unter dem Vorsitz von Charlotte Rampling getroffenen Wahl .
Auch sonst aber kann man die Jury - Entscheidungen als Freund der Filmkunst nur einigermaßen verhängnisvoll finden .
Sie bestätigen den Kurs , der den Wettbewerb im wesentlichen unter den zwei Aspekten von Proporz und Politik zusammenstellt .
Das heißt auch : unter fataler Absehung von ästhetischen Gesichtspunkten .
Diese Ignoranz wird von Jahr zu Jahr deutlicher und macht die Berlinale als Schauplatz für aufregende Filme zusehends irrelevant .
Kosslick lässt seine Erfolge in Zahlen messen und jubelt über neue Rekorde bei Kartenverkauf und Filmmarkt .
Mit der forcierten Konzentration auf künstlerisch eher uninteressantes , sich politisch gebendes Arthouse - Kino wird das Festival unter der erfolgreichen Oberfläche in Wahrheit jedoch entkernt .
Dass ( betroffenheits ) politische Aspekte bei der Preisvergabe entscheidend waren , daraus machtebei der Verleihungsgala gar keinen Hehl .
Wir hoffen , sagte sie gleich zu Beginn , dass die getroffene Wahl bei der derzeitigen Lage der
Welt die richtige ist .
So gab es Silberne Bären fürschlichten Politfilm " The Road to Guantanamo " , füräußerst belanglose dänische Transsexuellenstory " En Soap " undsehr respektablen , aber nicht überragenden Beitrag zur Lage der Frau im Iran " Offside " .
Und mit dem Goldenen Bären für " Grbavica " , die in Sarajewo angesiedelte Geschichte einer durch eine Vergewaltigung im Krieg traumatisierten Frau , hat es einen Film getroffen , der gewiss eindringlich und gekonnt ein wichtiges Thema anspricht .
Für die Gegenwart und Zukunft des Weltkinos ist er ohne Belang .

Ernst Zuendel wrote a book extolling the virtues of Hitler
Ernst Zuendel was convicted of 14 counts of inciting racial hatred and for denying that the Nazis killed six million Jews during World War II .
He received the maximum sentence under German law which bans Holocaust denial .
Zuendel moved to Canada in 1958 but was judged a national security threat and deported back to Germany in 2005 .
The 67 - year - old once published a book called The Hitler We Loved and Why , and described the former Nazi leader as " a decent and very peaceful man " .
EU ban plan
During his trial in the western German city of Mannheim , he was accused of using " pseudo - scientific " methods to try to rewrite the accepted history of the Nazi Holocaust in 14 pieces of written work and internet publications .
Zuendel had denied the charges , asserting his right to free speech , and questioned the constitutionality of the laws being used against him .
Germany hopes to make Holocaust denial a crime across the EU as part of a package of laws it wants to introduce during its presidency of the bloc .
Berlin is also set to outline plans to ban Nazi symbols like the swastika , which , like denying the massacre of the Jews , is already outlawed in Germany .
However , correspondents says such moves may be seen as curtailing freedom of speech and could prove controversial in several member states .
The No Shit Guide To Supporting OpenID In Your Applications
27 FEB
OpenID , with the superhuman effort of Mr Willison is taking the world by storm and I am amoungst the masses leaping onto the bandwagon .
Simon has done an excellent post and screencast detailing the whys and what - fors of OpenID so I thought I ’d have a bash at applying the same no -bullshit approach to the other side of the coin , supporting ( or as the official terminology puts it consuming ) OpenID in your applications .
With this post I ’m going to blast through the absolute essentials you need to get started so if you need more general background on OpenID check out Simon ’s stuff first .
The examples , as you might except will be using Ruby on Rails but all of the concepts are applicable across platforms .
So , without further ado , grab yourself a beer and we ’ll begin …
Overview of the authentication process
When consuming OpenID what you are trying to do is ask the user for their OpenID ( which is a URL ) then ascertain from their OpenID server that they actually own this OpenID .
Once you know that they own the OpenID you can then wack it in the session ( and use it as a really lightweight means of identifying users between visits ) or key it in with your own application specific account data if you need more power .
This article is going to take you up to and including verifying the user ’s OpenID .
What you do with it is left to your imagination .
On a more granular level the verification process breaks down into these steps :
Get the user to give you their OpenID URL .
‘ Begin ’ the verification process whereby your OpenID library of choice will work out the users OpenID server and , if successful , provide you with a redirect URL .
Redirect the user to the given redirect URL .
You specify a return URL within this URL .
The user goes to their OpenID server , logs in and authorises your site ’s verification request and is then redirected back to your return URL .
Your server ‘ completes ’ the verification request and , if successful , confirms that this user owns this OpenID .
The end .
So that ’s essentially it .
Some of the details of the transactions between your server , the user ’s delegates and the OpenID are pretty complex but fortunately for us there are lots of good libraries for most platforms that mean you do n’t need to bugger about with the crypotography and stuff .
Woo hoo .
For these examples we are going to use the ruby - openid gem but you can choose your own .
Also note that East Media have a OpenID Consumer plugin for Rails that wraps even more detail with some generators but it ’s good to understand the concepts before you let something write your code for you .
Get your library sorted
That ’s easy .
For us Rubyists its :
$ sudo gem install ruby - openid -y
Create your OpenID consuming controller
We are going to try to be as RESTy as possible here so we ’ll create a singleton resource called openid .
In routes.rb :
map.resource :openid , : member => { : complete => : get }
Then we ’ll set up a simple controller .
Firstly , we ’ll need to require the ruby - openid gem here .
We are also going to need a method that gives us an OpenID consumer object which is the single most complex part of this whole thing ( and it is n’t complex ) .
First , here ’s the skeleton :
require_gem ' ruby - openid ' class OpenidController < ApplicationController def new # TODO : show a form requesting the user 's OpenID end def create # TODO : begin the OpenID verification process end def complete # TODO : omplete the OpenID verification process end protected def openid_consumer @openid_consumer ||= OpenID ::Consumer.new(session , OpenID :: FilesystemStore.new ( " #{RAILS_ROOT}/tmp/openid " ) ) end end
The OpenID :: Consumer constructor takes two arguments , the first one should be a hash like object that holds session data .
That ’s always going to be session for Rails .
The second one takes a file store object which is used to store state information for the verification process .
There ’s lots ( including an ActiveRecord store ) but for many apps the filesystem store is fine .
Getting the user ’s OpenID
The new action just needs to show a simple form posting the OpenID to the create action :
< % form_tag openid_path do %> <%= text_field_tag ' openid_url ' %> <%= submit_tag ' Login ' %> <% end %>
Note that it ’s convention to call the field openid_url so browsers will autocomplete nicely .
They also recommend that you embed the OpenID logo in the form field .
Get the logo then try some CSS like this :
#openid_url { background : url(/images/login-bg.gif ) no -repeat # FFF 5 px ; padding - left : 25 px ; }
Beginning the verification
The create action is going to be responsible for kicking off the process :
def create openid_url = params [ : openid_url ] response = openid_consumer.begin openid_url if response.status == OpenID ::SUCCESS redirect_url = response.redirect_url( home_url , complete_openid_url ) redirect_to redirect_url return end flash [ : error ] = " Could n't find an OpenID for that URL " render : action => : new end
We simply get the OpenID and pass it to the begin method of our consumer object to get a response .
We then handle the status of the response which can have a number of states .
For this super simple example we are just going to look for success but in a production app you ’ll need to handle error states more usefully .
If the response was successful we call redirect_url passing the trust root and the return URL .
The return URL is simply our complete action .
The trust root is normally the homepage URL of your site .
We then redirect the user to the resulting URL where the user logs in to their OpenID server , authorises your verification request and is ( normally ) redirected to return URL you provided .
Completing the verification
When the user is redirected back to your application the server will append information about the response in the query string which the OpenID library will unpack :
def complete response = openid_consumer.complete params if response.status == OpenID :: SUCCESS session [ : openid ] = response.identity_url # the user is now logged in with OpenID ! redirect_to home_url return end flash [ : error ] =
' Could not log on with your OpenID ' redirect_to new_openid_url end
After passing the params hash containing all the info that the OpenID server sent us to the complete method we are given a response status to handle .
Again for production apps more states should be handled but here , if the complete was successful we have completed the process .
Here we just store the identity_url given in the session but at this point we could also do something like :
session [ :user ] = User.find_by_openid_url(response.identity_url )
Which would grab the users local account data based on the OpenID .
Easy as pasty .
However , there ’s a few more bits and bobs you might want to know about .
Simple Registration Extension ( SReg )
SReg is a basic means by which you can request additional information about the user from their OpenID server which you might normally use to prefill account details or other form fields .
The information you can request access to is in the spec but there ’s not much there at the moment .
It ’s still kind of useful .
To request this information you need to add parameters to the redirect URL which is of course handled for you by your library .
Revisiting the create action , we just add a call to add_extension_arg :
def create openid_url = params [ : openid_url ] response = openid_consumer.begin openid_url if response.status == OpenID :: SUCCESS response.add_extension_arg ( ' sreg ' , 'required ' , 'email ' ) # < == here ... response.add_extension_arg ( ' sreg ' , 'optional ' , 'nickname , gender ' ) # < == ... and here redirect_url = response.redirect_url( home_url , complete_openid_url ) redirect_to redirect_url return end flash [ : error ] =
" Could n't find an OpenID for that URL " render : action => : new end
Then in the complete action , extract the returned information :
def complete response = openid_consumer.complete params if response.status == OpenID :: SUCCESS session [ : openid ] = response.identity_url # the user is now logged in with OpenID ! @registration_info = response.extension_response(' sreg ' ) # <= { ' name ' => ' Dan Webb ' , etc ... } redirect_to home_url return end flash [ : error ] =
' Could not log on with your OpenID ' redirect_to new_openid_url end
Immediate mode
Immediate mode allows you to attempt to verify the user without them leaving your site at all .
This is normally possible if , during the first time you attempt to verify a user , they choose to always allow you to verify them and offers a slightly more streamlined login experience .
To implement this we first pass an extra argument to redirect_url :
def create openid_url = params [ : openid_url ] response = openid_consumer.begin openid_url if response.status == OpenID ::SUCCESS redirect_url = response.redirect_url( home_url , complete_openid_url , true ) # < == here redirect_to redirect_url return end flash [ : error ] = " Could n't find an OpenID for that URL " render : action => : new end
Then ensure that our complete action handles the OpenID :: SETUP_NEEDED status by redirecting them to the OpenID server ’s setup page :
def complete response = openid_consumer .complete params case response.status when OpenID :: SUCCESS session [ : openid ] = response.identity_url redirect_to home_url return when OpenID :: SETUP_NEEDED redirect_to response.setup_url # < == here !
return end flash [ : error ] =
' Could not log on with your OpenID ' redirect_to new_openid_url end
Fin
So that ’s it .
All you need to know to start getting OpenID going in your web applications .
You ’ve got no excuse now .
In fact , neither have I …
Any corrections , questions or further wisdom are very welcome .
I ’m no expert on OpenID , I ’ve literally just picked all this up from reading API docs , specs and source code and thought it would be good to share .
let me know what you think .
Genesis Machines : The New Science of Biocomputing
by Martyn Amos
353 pp , Atlantic , £ 18.99
If you thought molecular biology was an earnest business , look here : a scientist has coaxed strands of DNA into forming countless tiny smiley faces , a hundred times smaller than a red blood cell .
Haunting !
Reproduced photographically in this book is the smallest smile ever made , looking almost as though it belongs to a benign alien intelligence .
Humans love to read faces into clouds or rock formations on Mars ; now they can imprint their features in the submicroscopic netherworld .
The researcher 's boss declared : " In a typical reaction , he can make about 50 billion smiley faces .
I think this is the most concentrated happiness ever created . "
The optimism of the rave generation lives on .
Amos 's fascinating book shows how such miniature manipulation is a step on the road to " truly programmable matter " .
Researchers dream of a microscopic " doctor " robot that travels around in your bloodstream and dispenses drugs at the first sign of illness .
But it will not be a submarine shrunk by a miniaturising ray , as in Fantastic Voyage ; it wo n't be electronic at all .
Why reinvent the wheel ?
Nature 's " machines " already contain the components we need .
" Science - fiction authors tell stories of ' microbots ' - incredibly tiny devices that can roam around under their own power , sensing their environment , talking to one another and destroying intruders , " Amos notes .
" Such devices already exist , but we know them better as bacteria . "
Amos , who was awarded the first ever PhD in " DNA computing " , takes us on a canter through computer history .
The legendary mathematician Alan Turing , hero of Bletchley Park , described a universal computing device now known as a Turing Machine : a box that reads inputs off a long skein of tape , performs algorithms on the data , and outputs an answer .
It turns out that biology functions in an amazingly similar way : a molecule " head " reads the " tape " of one strand of a DNA double helix and " writes " the complementary base on to a new strand .
" Jeez , " one researcher remembers thinking , " these things could compute . "
A decade ago , people began trying to build computers on this basis .
What do such computers look like ?
Well , like liquid sloshing around in a test tube .
Set up your problem , and trillions of molecules will nearly instantaneously find a huge range of possible answers .
The trick is in picking out the right one .
Amos describes such experiments beautifully , combining laboratory drama with technical explanations of techniques for splicing and bolting together bits of DNA .
It 's rather like super - complex Meccano .
After a while , however , it becomes clear that the approach needs to be more structured .
We need a set of " biobricks " to build stuff with .
From Meccano to Lego .
Here is a microbial camera that uses bacteria as pixels .
And the really cool part is " self - assembly " .
IKEA self - assembly furniture is mournfully misnamed , as it does not actually build itself .
But that 's what , for instance , a pair of sticky DNA tweezers does .
Maybe one day the technique could be scaled up to shelving units .
Once you have built a molecular computer that has the same sort of error - correction , support , repair and replication functions as , say , a human cell , what have you done ?
You have , perhaps , created life from the ground up .
Dr Frankenstein had nothing on the new generation of " biohackers " .
Biohackers are like computer hackers , but instead of fiddling with , say , website code , they are fiddling with the " code of life " .
Cue a new generation of complaints about scientists playing God .
And , as Amos admits , there are legitimate concerns about the new technology .
Researchers have tried to build safety catches into their work by giving , for example , killer genes to their designer bacteria , so that the bugs automatically die after a set period .
The problem is that evolution finds a way around it : a mutant copy of the killer gene arises that does n't work properly , and a new generation of the little monsters lives on .
This was entirely predicted , says Amos happily of the experiment , which is not perfectly reassuring .
Evolution can also be harnessed , on the other hand , by building a rough version of the system you want and then letting it mutate into the most efficient configuration .
Of course , you would n't want this stuff escaping into the wild .
Amos ends on the sensible note that , like any disruptive technology , biocomputing requires rational political discussion and supervision .
Well , we can hope .
The book also shows how hard it is to get away from the constant application of engineering metaphors , such as Amos 's claim that genes are " computing components " , and anthropomorphic language , as when it is said that ribosome works by " interpreting mRNA messages " .
This is manna to creationists , who insist that where there is a computer , there must be someone who designed it .
Amos skips lightly over such philosophical problems , but it is a serious question whether appeals to " self - organisation " or " information " are themselves in some sense metaphysical , even if one rejects the epistemological nihilism of " Intelligent Design " .
Understandably , however , Amos is more of the pragmatic scientist 's persuasion : sure , there 's a mystery here - so let 's tinker around and try to solve it .
His lucid and punchy prose conveys a genuine excitement of the frontier .
It is even possible that , when the footnote numbering goes crazy on pages 199 - 201 , it is some sort of joke about genetic mutation .
Sadly , I was not able to find meaning in the resulting number series .

Most obviously , plan9port derives from Plan 9 from Bell Labs and would not exist without the work of the Plan 9 team over the past many years .
Rob Pike suggested the original X11 port of libdraw years ago , as part of drawterm , and strongly encouraged the Mac OS X work .
He has also been a consistent source of good ideas to hide the ugliness of modern Unix .
William Josephson handled troff ( 1 ) ( with Taj Khattra ) and many of the supporting programs .
He also inspired the thread library clean - up and has ported a handful of applications .
Andrey Mirtchovski and Axel Belinfante have done significant work dealing with X11 corner cases and fine - tuning rio( 1 ) .
Axel never tires of finding bugs in the SunOS port .
Latchesar Ionkov has contributed many fixes to tricky bugs , and got factotum ( 4 ) up and running .
Many other people have provided help , ported programs , written bug reports , sent useful patches , and gotten plan9port running on new systems .
Bigelow & Holmes , Inc. created the screen fonts in the luc , lucm , lucsans , and pelm directories and granted permission to redistribute them with plan9port .
Thanks to all .

" I actually saw it and I do n't want to see it again . "
Irwin , 44 , died on Monday when he was stabbed in the chest by a stingray barb while snorkelling on the Great Barrier Reef and Stainton has said footage of the incident is " terrible " .
The footage shows Irwin pulling the barb out of his chest before dying .
While Stainton wants the footage kept under wraps , media experts say it might soon be circulating on the internet .
" The key point is once there 's something on film , it 's impossible to keep it contained , " said Paul Levinson , chairman of Fordham University 's Department of Communication and Media Studies .
Stainton , who broke down several times during the CNN interview , said Irwin 's wife , Terri , was struggling with her husband 's death .
When King asked Stainton how Terri was doing , he replied : " A lot worse than me . "
Stainton told how he travelled with Irwin 's body in a casket on a seaplane from Cairns to Irwin 's family on Queensland 's Sunshine Coast yesterday .
" We brought him home last night because he has been in Cairns , " Stainton said .
" I travelled on the plane with him for six hours , just him and I .
For five hours I could n't stop crying .
It was devastating . "
When Irwin 's family saw the casket , it brought a sense of reality that the larger than life Irwin had died , he said .
" The fact that we finally got him home and the family saw the casket last night , it was like a full stop , " he said .
" Until you actually see that you can't imagine it .
" You think it 's a dream and it 's not happening .
But it is and it has and it's done . "
Stainton said the family was still too distressed to decide when Irwin 's funeral would take place .
The Irwin family has been offered a state funeral .
" We have n't worked it out yet , " he said .
" We can't even get to it .
" Just listening to his voice .
It 's just hard . "

OK , we 've all seen it countless times in science fiction films and TV shows .
The captain gets wise to the bad guy and tosses him into the cold , vast vacuum of space to die .
Or the hero is given a burial - at - space and her flag - draped casket is released out of the space ship .
Or President Roslyn learns that you 're a frakking Cylon and tosses you out of the airlock . ;-)
Here 's my question : after the bad guy dies , what happens to his body and space suit ?
It 's in a vacuum , so there are no forces to cause it to deteriorate , correct ?
Does it float until it loses its momentum , so it just sits in space forever ?
Provided it does n't get snatched by the gravity of a large or moving mass , it 'll just be there forever , right ?
Lost in space ... forever ?
What happens after you 're tossed out of the airlock ?
PEOPLE born under the astrological sign of Leo are 15 % more likely to be admitted to hospital with gastric bleeding than those born under the other 11 signs .
Sagittarians are 38 % more likely than others to land up there because of a broken arm .
Those are the conclusions that many medical researchers would be forced to make from a set of data presented to the American Association for the Advancement of Science by Peter Austin of the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences in Toronto .
At least , they would be forced to draw them if they applied the lax statistical methods of their own work to the records of hospital admissions in Ontario , Canada , used by Dr Austin .
Dr Austin , of course , does not draw those conclusions .
His point was to shock medical researchers into using better statistics , because the ones they routinely employ today run the risk of identifying relationships when , in fact , there are none .
He also wanted to explain why so many health claims that look important when they are first made are not substantiated in later studies .
The confusion arises because each result is tested separately to see how likely , in statistical terms , it was to have happened by chance .
If that likelihood is below a certain threshold , typically 5 % , then the convention is that an effect is “ real ” .
And that is fine if only one hypothesis is being tested .
But if , say , 20 are being tested at the same time , then on average one of them will be accepted as provisionally true , even though it is not .
In his own study , Dr Austin tested 24 hypotheses , two for each astrological sign .
He was looking for instances in which a certain sign “ caused ” an increased risk of a particular ailment .
The hypotheses about Leos ' intestines and Sagittarians ' arms were less than 5 % likely to have come about by chance , satisfying the usual standards of proof of a relationship .
However , when he modified his statistical methods to take into account the fact that he was testing 24 hypotheses , not one , the boundary of significance dropped dramatically .
At that point , none of the astrological associations remained .
Unfortunately , many researchers looking for risk factors for diseases are not aware that they need to modify their statistics when they test multiple hypotheses .
The consequence of that mistake , as John Ioannidis of the University of Ioannina School of Medicine , in Greece , explained to the meeting , is that a lot of observational health studies — those that go trawling through databases , rather than relying on controlled experiments — cannot be reproduced by other researchers .
Previous work by Dr Ioannidis , on six highly cited observational studies , showed that conclusions from five of them were later refuted .
In the new work he presented to the meeting , he looked systematically at the causes of bias in such research and confirmed that the results of observational studies are likely to be completely correct only 20 % of the time .
If such a study tests many hypotheses , the likelihood its conclusions are correct may drop as low as one in 1,000 — and studies that appear to find larger effects are likely , in fact , simply to have more bias .
So , the next time a newspaper headline declares that something is bad for you , read the small print .
If the scientists used the wrong statistical method , you may do just as well believing your horoscope .
A castle was almost certainly planned when King Edward visited Anglesey in 1283 and designated the Welsh town of Llanfaes to be its seat of government .
At the time , resources were already stretched and any such scheme was postponed .
Then , in 1294 - 95 , the Welsh rose in revolt under Madog ap Llywelyn .
The rebels were crushed after an arduous winter campaign , and the decision was taken to proceed with a new castle in April 1295 .
The extent of English power is demonstrated by the fact that the entire native population of Llanfaes was forced to move to a newly established settlement , named Newborough .
The castle itself was begun on the " fair marsh , " and was given the Norman - French name Beau Mareys .
Building progressed at an astonishing speed , with some 2,600 men engaged in the work during the first year .
T his is undoubtedly the ultimate " concentric " castle , built with an almost geometric symmetry .
Conceived as an integral whole , a high inner ring of defenses is surrounded by a lower outer circuit of walls , combining an almost unprecedented level of strength and firepower .
Before the age of cannon , the attacker would surely have been faced with an impregnable fortress .
Yet , ironically , the work of construction was never fully completed , and the castle saw little action apart from the Civil War in the 17th century .
A cross the moat is the low curtain wall of the outer ward , its circuit punctuated by 16 towers and two gates .
On the northern side , the Llanfaes gate was probably never completed .
The gate next to the sea , on the other hand , preserves evidence of its stout wooden doors and gruesome " murder holes " above .
Once through , an attacker would still have to face 11 further obstacles before entering the heart of the castle .
These included the barbican , further " murder holes , " three portcullises and several sets of doors .
If the daunting prospect of the gate - passage proved too much , the would - be attacker caught hesitating between the inner and outer walls could not have survived for long .
A rain of heavy crossfire would have poured down from all directions .
T
V isitors should not miss the little chapel situated in the tower of that name .
It 's vaulted ceiling and pointed windows make it one of the highlights of the castle .
Also in this tower there is a fascinating exhibition on the " Castles of Edward I in Wales , and this provides much background to the building of Beaumaris itself .
T he visitor may well be left wondering why all the lavish accommodation was contemplated .
In short , it was to provide the necessary apartments for the king and , if he should marry again , his queen .
Moreover , his son , the Prince of Wales was fast approaching marriageable age .
Considering the size of both households , plus the need to accommodate royal officers , the constable , and even the sheriff of Anglesey , the scale of these domestic arrangements is put into perspective .
D espite being planned on such a grand scale , by 1298 the funds for building Beaumaris had dried up .
The king was increasingly involved with works in Gascony and Scotland .
Although there were minor building works in later times , the castle is in many ways a blueprint which was never fully realized .
Jeff Thomas 1995
B ecause the description above does a good job of explaining the historical significance of Beaumaris , I will try to describe instead my own impressions of the castle from our visits in 1994 / 95 .
Baumaris is a special castle .
Some feel it 's the most beautiful in all of Wales , while others appreciate the almost perfect symmetry Beaumaris possesses .
The image most people associate with the castle is one of swans swimming peacefully in the castle moat , framed by Beaumaris ' handsome checkered - stone exterior towers .
This is the first striking aspect of the castle : its exterior beauty .
A lthough never completed to their planned height , Beaumaris ' large exterior towers are impressive , their formidability enhanced by handsome patterns of stone in shades of dark gray to white , adorning the exterior walls and towers .
Most of the castle is surrounded by a moat , framed by a beautiful green park complete with picnic tables .
Families of ducks and swans add to the attractive setting as does the castle 's handsome gatehouse and wooden bridge , the main entrance to the castle .
So , much of Beaumaris ' beauty can actually be appreciated before setting foot inside the castle !
I f the castle 's exterior towers can be called large , then Beaumaris ' six interior towers can only be described as huge .
Only William Marshall 's great tower at Pembroke Castle and William ap Thomas ' tower at Raglan Castle rival the six huge inner towers at Beaumaris .
Once inside the gatehouse the dimensions of these towers become clear , if not a bit confusing .
Confusing , because the concentric design of the castle means that one set of walls and towers looks exactly like the others as you make your way around the ward .
Only differences in the front and rear gatehouses gives clues to your exact location in the outer ward !
T he third thing I like about Beaumaris ( and my favorite thing ) are the fascinating interior passageways found inside the walls of the inner ward .
Beaumaris and Caernarfon are practically the only two Welsh castles that afford visitors an opportunity to explore significant sections of inner wall passageways .
Caernarfon 's are more extensive , but chances are Beaumaris ' passages wo n't be packed with tourists !
In other words , Beaumaris gives visitors the opportunity to explore this feature in a more intimate environment .
Do n't miss seeing the lovely little chapel as part of your passageway walk , a peaceful place to stop and reflect on your surroundings .
T he final thing I find remarkable about Beaumaris are the wonderful views afforded across the Menai Straight to the Snowdonia Mountains beyond - breathtaking scenery that can be enjoyed from within or outside the castle .
Although Beaumaris lacks the spectacular siting of some of Edward 's other north Wales castles , the beauty of the castle and surrounding countryside is undeniable .
Beaumaris Castle has been designated a " World Heritage Site " because it represents a significant accomplishment in the art of medieval castle - building .
The fact that it is also one of the prettier sites in Wales is a bonus that makes this castle well worth a visit .
So , in your haste to see popular , touristy Caernarfon Castle , consider making the short drive from Caernarfon to Beaumaris for a totally unique castle experience !
Eric Hodel posted their production website server setup over at the Robot Coop that handled 2.5 M page views in a day not too long ago .
I love this kind of information because it helps me get a feel for how we ’re doing .
At GreatSchools we serve around 900,000 - 980,000 page views on an average weekday , our record day was a bit above 3 M page views , and siege load testing puts our cap around 4400 page views per minute .
The great thing about using siege is that we extract the load test from our access logs so that we can simulate real conditions .
We size the hardware based on running at around 25 % of our capacity on an average weekday which usually gives us just enough breathing room to handle a front page feature on Yahoo or AOL when those happen .
None of the above include crawler activity which we factor out from all of our numbers since their activity is pretty constant and accounts for about 200 k page views per day ( above the 980 k real user page views ) .
The numbers also do not include redirects , 404s , images , css , javascript … just real user page views as best can be determined .
Like Robot Coop we ’re a FreeBSD shop but with older servers and we ’re still evaluating FreeBSD 6 before upgrading all our machines from 4.11 .
I ’m looking forward to doing some load testing with FreeBSD 6 to see if it ’s much improved multi- threading support boosts our capacity !
Without further ado , here ’s our setup :
1 . Web servers : 10 of varying hardware but I ’d guess they average out to about a 2 Ghz dual Xeon .
Each server has 1GB each running Apache / mod_perl / mod_jk / Tomcat .
2. Databases : 3 MySQL servers consisting of 1 read write primary ( Dual 2.8 Xeon / 2GB ) and 2 read - only replicated slaves where we can manually failover if the read write primary fails .
3 . Proxy servers : 3
Oops proxy servers to cache images and CSS ( overkill ) .
4 . File server : 1 NFS file server with a warm standby that is kept in synch .
5. Load balancers : 2 hot failover hardware load balancers .
If you know the setup of other sites or have seen one posted somewhere let me know , I ’m always looking to see what other setups look like .

US President George Bush is to host White House talks on British comedian Sacha Baron Cohen .
Cohen , 35 , creator of Ali G , has infuriated the Kazakhstan government with his portrayal of Borat , a bumbling Kazakh TV presenter .
And now a movie of Borat 's adventures in the US has caused a diplomatic incident .
The opening scene , which shows Borat lustily kissing his sister goodbye and setting off for America in a car pulled by a horse , had audiences in stitches when it was first shown last week .
But the film , which has just premiered at the Toronto Film Festival , has prompted a swift reaction from the Kazakhstan government , which is launching a PR blitz in the States .
Kazakhstan president Nursultan Nazarbayev is to fly to the US to meet President Bush in the coming weeks and on the agenda will be his country 's image .
President Nazarbayev has confirmed his government will buy " educational " TV spots and print advertisements about the " real Kazakhstan " in a bid to save the country 's reputation before the film is released in the US in November .
President Nazarbayev will visit the White House and the Bush family compound in Maine when he flies in for talks that will include the fictional character Borat .
But a spokesman for the Kazakhstan Embassy says it is unlikely that President Nazarbayev will find the film funny .
Roman Vassilenko said : " The Government has expressed its displeasure about Borat 's representation of our country .
" Our opinion of the character has not changed .
" We understand that the film exposes the hypocrisy that exists both here in the USA and in the UK and understand that Mr Cohen has a right to freedom of speech .
" Nursultan Nazarbayev has taken Mr Bush up on an invitation to visit this country to help build our relationship with the USA .
" I cannot speak for the president himself , only for the government , but I certainly do n't think President Nazarbayev and Mr Bush will share a joke about the film .
" The bottom line is we want people to know that he does not represent the true people of Kazakhstan . "
The Kazakh government has previously threatened Baron - Cohen with legal action , for allowing Borat to , among other things , make fun of his homeland , demean women , slander gypsies and urge listeners to " Throw the Jew Down the Well . "
Anti-Borat hard - liners have pulled the plug on borat.kz , Borat 's Kazakhstan - based Website after his frequent displays of anti-Semitism and his portrayal of Kazakh culture .
Nurlan Isin , President of the Association of Kazakh IT Companies took the action after complaints .
He said : " We 've done this so he can't badmouth Kazakhstan under the .kz domain name .
" He can go and do whatever he wants at other domains . "
The row originally erupted in November 2005 , following Borat 's hosting of the MTV Europe Music Awards in Lisbon .
The Kazakh Foreign Ministry was furious over Cohen 's bad taste representation of the nation .
' No such thing as bad publicity '
Foreign Ministry spokesman Yerzhan Ashykbayev told a news conference : " We view Mr. Cohen 's behaviour at the MTV Europe Music Awards as utterly unacceptable , being a concoction of bad taste and ill manners which is completely incompatible with the ethics and civilized behaviour of Kazakhstan 's people .
" We reserve the right to any legal action to prevent new pranks of the kind . "
Baron Cohen responded to Ashykbayev in character by posting a video on the Official Borat website .
In the video , Borat said , " In response to Mr. Ashykbayev 's comments , I 'd like to state I have no connection with Mr. Cohen and fully support my Government 's decision to sue this Jew .
" Since the 2003 Tuleyakiv reforms , Kazakhstan is as civilized as any other country in the world .
" Women can now travel on inside of bus , homosexuals no longer have to wear blue hats , and age of consent has been raised to eight years old . "
His blatant outpouring then prompted the Kazakh government to hire two public relations firms to counter the claims , and ran a four - page advertisement in The New York Times .
The ad carried testimonials about the nation 's democracy , education system and the power and influence enjoyed by women .
News of President Nazarbayev 's upcoming visit has prompted experts to study the character 's impact on US culture .
Sean R. Roberts , Central Asian Affairs Fellow at Georgetown University , has been studying the phenomenon .
He said : " I have found that more Americans are aware of Kazakhstan than four years ago when I last lived in the United States .
" The increased knowledge of Kazakhstan , however , is not due to the country 's economic successes or its role as a U.S. ally in the war on terror .
" Instead , most Americans who have heard of Kazakhstan have heard of it through a satire of a Kazakh journalist named Borat .
" Borat certainly does not promote an image of Kazakhstan that is in sync with that which the government and its leader would like to promote abroad .
" As the old adage goes , however , ' there is no such thing as bad publicity . '
" If that is true , Borat is bringing much more publicity to Kazakhstan . "
Cohen 's representatives refused to allow him or his alter ego to respond to the controversy because it 's not close enough to the film 's release date .
The stories do not have to be true to get wide circulation , though usually there is at least a grain of truth .
The European Commission 's ultimate defence against accusations of barminess and meddling is that very few European laws get passed without the UK government 's agreement .
Here is a selection of recent and not - so - recent furores we have loved over the 50 years since the signing of the Treaty of Rome , which established the European Community .
DECIMAL DIKTAT
The story is that Brussels is forcing Britain to give up its beloved imperial measurements - ounces , pounds and stones , feet and inches , miles and acres , and others .
Five market traders , widely known as the metric martyrs , went all the way to the High Court to defend their right to sell food by the pound .
They lost , and Brussels was widely cast as the villain of the story .
Brussels rules are not threatening the British pint
Since 1 January 2000 food has been sold in grams and kilograms , though ounces and pounds can be indicated as well , at least until 2009 .
The UK is technically under an obligation to dump the mile , pint , acre and troy ounce , which are still in general use , at some point in the future .
Although the European Commission says it has no desire to force the pace , and will never stop Britons downing pints of beer , the odd commissioner sometimes mutters that it is time for the UK to fall into line .
British children already know nothing about pounds and stones , feet and inches , or degrees Fahrenheit , so for the next generation it may not be a big issue .
THE STRAIGHT BANANA
Was the European Union trying to ban straight bananas , or bent ones ?
This story goes back so far that a lot of people are no longer sure quite what the scandal was about .
They just remember that Brussels seemed to be taking an unhealthy interest in the shape of this fruit .
If it 's abnormally curved , it 's not Class I
No attempt is made to define " abnormal curvature " in the case of bananas , which must lead to lots of arguments .
Contrast the case of cucumbers ( Commission Regulation ( EEC ) No 1677 / 88 ) , where Class I and " Extra class " cucumbers are allowed a bend of 10 mm per 10 cm of length .
Class II cucumbers can bend twice as much .
BOMBAY MIX
The city once known in English as Bombay is now known as Mumbai .
So should the spicy snack known as Bombay Mix be renamed , in order to strip it of colonial overtones ?
According to one British newspaper in July 2006 , this is precisely what " nutty EU officials " were demanding , in the name of political correctness .
It would be an exaggeration to say that the British nation was united in indignation , but the story is an interesting one because it is a 100 % pure example of what the European Commission calls a " euromyth " .
It was traced back to its roots by the Daily Telegraph 's Brussels correspondent at the time , David Rennie , who spoke to the small - town news agency which sold the story to the national press .
The agency 's news editor said it " came from a mate of his at the Home Office , who had heard it being talked about " .
Had he tried to pin it down , or found any piece of paper discussing the change ?
Had he found a manufacturer who had been advised to alter a product name ?
No , it was " just meant to be funny for the tabloids " .
BARMAIDS ' BREASTS
There was great alarm in 2005 when it was reported that " po-faced pen-pushers " from the EU had ordered a cover - up of barmaids ' cleavages .
The story was that a proposed new directive would stop workers exposing their skin to the sun , because of the risk of skin cancer .
One paper launched a " Save Our Jugs " campaign .
Oktoberfest can keep the traditional Bavarian dresses
In the end , a vote in the European Parliament ensured that sunshine was dropped from the directive .
It provides protection for people working with artificial radiation sources , such as lasers and infra-red lamps , but leaves barmaids and their admiring customers unaffected .
THE EUROSAUSAGE
Back in the 1980s , the European Commission hatched a plan to re-name the British sausage an " emulsified high - fat offal tube " .
A government minister successfully repelled the threat and became prime minister thanks to a wave of support for the Great British Banger .
His name was Jim Hacker , and this was not the real world , but the television comedy Yes Minister .
Sausages are now better labelled - but not as " offal tubes "
At the same time , European legislation has led to some changes in the great British banger .
Rules on better labelling of food made it compulsory to specify when a product contained " mechanically recovered meat " - a substance sucked out of bones - and said that it would not count as part of the product 's meat content .
At this point manufacturers lost their enthusiasm for it , and it is now rarely encountered .
FIREMEN'S POLES
A European " safety directive " was accused in 2002 of forcing fire stations to abandon the poles the firefighters have traditionally used to slide quickly from their sleeping quarters to their fire engines .
The pole is fast , but one firefighter can get squashed by the next one coming down .
So , the story went , Brussels decreed it unsafe .
After 200 years of pole - sliding , firemen were forced to use the stairs .
Actually there was no mention of firemen 's poles in any EU health and safety legislation .
And poles are still used by many British fire services .
So was the story false ?
Not entirely .
The UK government transposed some pieces of EU legislation into British law with the 1992 Codes of Practice on health and safety at work , which may have served as the cue for some fire services to stop using the pole on health and safety grounds .
However , what about the county fire service that has reinstated the pole after finding that groups of sleepy , half - dressed firemen rushing down two or three flights of stairs in the middle of the night tend to end up in a heap at the bottom ?
Has it too been spurred into action by the European " safety directive " ?
CORGIS TO BE BANNED
In 2002 the press reported a threat to certain breeds of the Queen 's favourite dog from " a controversial EU convention " .
About 100 breeds , including some corgis , bulldogs , King Charles and cocker spaniels , were apparently in danger of being banned .
Corgis are famously associated with the Queen
The UK is a member of the Council of Europe , but has not signed up to this particular convention .
NO MORE YOGHURT
In 2003 , newspapers detected a threat to British yoghurt .
In future it would be known as " fermented milk " or even " mild , alternate - culture , heat - treated fermented milk " , as part of what one called an attempt to define a " standardised euro - pudding " .
Actually , no official proposals had been drawn up .
Even in unofficial discussions , the European Commission said , there had been no suggestion that producers would be prevented from using the word " yoghurt " , only that other terms such as " heat - treated " or " mild " should be used as well .
The goal was to help yoghurt producers in one country sell their product in another , where traditional yoghurts were slightly different .
Three years later the story resurfaced .
This time a newspaper said only yoghurts made according to traditional Bulgarian recipes would be able to use the name .
The European Commission repeated that the idea of producing an EU - wide " harmonised " definition of yoghurt had been debated in 2003 , but then abandoned .
In our days the amplitude of auto tunning is bigger and bigger .
Everbody want to add style , and personality to his car .
Everybody want 's to be unique and special , and this service can help you .
Auto tunning can transform older cars in new shiny unique cars .
A lot 's of examples we have in Xzibit 's tv show at MTV ( PIMP my Ride ) .
Now look what this people just done with their cars .
All i can say is that they are very unique and original .
With such a truck you 'll have all eyes on you .
This is an amazing car .

Soon after one of my daughters started going to a private school in Washington , I received a call from a mother of one of her classmates .
An initial donation helped create one of the greatest museums
" Yes , my daughter would love a play date , " I said , assuming - wrongly , as it turned out - that this was the purpose of the call .
" We were actually looking for some help with our scholarship fund .
We are still half a million dollars short of our target ! "
A lump formed in my throat , immediately followed by huge relief that the caller had clearly got the wrong parent , since we do not - unfortunately - have half a million bucks to give away .
" Any donation would be appreciated , " came the reply to my unspoken thoughts , " however small ! "
Worth of a ' friend '
There was the challenge .
What exactly is the price of self - esteem ?
Reputation ?
A good deed ?
As my mind raced through all the possibilities of humiliation , the mother threw me a lifeline .
Andrew Carnegie kick - started US philanthropy in the 19th Century
Phew ... no need to make excuses about misplaced credit cards and empty cheque books .
The web spelled it out .
Donations from $ 1 to $ 500 earned you the accolade of " friend " .
Not bad .
But there were six other categories , and everything over $ 10,000 turned you into a " millennium donor " , a stellar title which came with the embossing of your name on a plaque .
So in the school 's fundraising code , " friend " was the equivalent of " lunch " in that infamous phrase : " Let 's do lunch one of these days ! "
Concrete charity
Once a year it is possible to witness this generosity " live " in the form of the school auction .
Hundreds of parents meet in a fancy Washington hotel , chase some surf and turf around a plate , and bid for everything from holiday homes donated by wealthy parents to paintings or pottery made by their own children .
Microsoft founder Bill Gates and his wife have given billions away
It went for $ 24,000 .
The man sitting next to me helped out : " Do n't worry , Matt .
Everything over value can be deducted from tax .
And the value of a slab of concrete is probably $ 20 . "
Americans give to schools , hospitals , libraries , galleries and the poor like no other country in the world .
Last year , American citizens gave more money to victims of the tsunami than their government did .
Cornerstone of culture
Yes , charity can be written off against tax , but it is also hard - wired into the psyche of a nation founded by pilgrims and enriched by private enterprise .
It is impossible to imagine modern America without philanthropy , because so many of the institutions funded by the state in Europe are financed by private citizens in this country .
I 'm still giving it away - it's not as if I 'm missing any meals or anything

In Washington , 16 of the nation 's greatest museums are free because of the Smithsonian Institution .
In 1829 , James Smithson , an English scientist , left his fortune to his nephew but stipulated that if the nephew died without children ( legitimate or illegitimate ) " the money should go the United States of America to found at Washington an establishment for the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men " .
Thankfully , Smithson 's nephew died childless , and the seed money has been invested and supplemented to produce one of the greatest cultural foundations in the world .
Andrew Carnegie , the Scottish - born steel magnate who became the father of modern philanthropy , not only gave his name to one of the most famous concert halls in the US , as well as dozens of other theatres , he also funded thousands of public libraries all over America .
It was he who once quipped : " He who dies rich , dies disgraced . "
Others have followed suit .
Bill and Melinda Gates have already spent $ 30bn of their money on good causes .
Every year their foundation gives more to global health causes like malaria , TB and Aids than the World Health Organization .
Thanks a billion
Ted Turner , the founder of CNN who sports a pencil moustache and calls the actress Jane Fonda " my favourite ex- wife " , famously gave $ 1bn to the UN , because his own country would not pay its dues .
" Why a billion ? " I asked him .
" Nice round figure ! " he told me .
The money is doled out over 10 years in lots of $ 100 m , and Mr Turner keeps on giving even though he also sustained the biggest personal loss ever in financial history .
After the Time - AOL merger and the bursting of the dot.com bubble , Ted - as he insists on being called - lost more than $ 6bn .
" I sure took a hit , " he said in a recent interview .
" But I 'm still giving it away .
It 's not as if I 'm missing any meals or anything . "
Philanthropy is so well established it has spawned its own academic discipline .
New York University has a department of philanthropy .
There is also the Chronicle of Philanthropy .
I have even attended a philanthropy workshop in the bowels of Congress , where rich Americans learned how to give their money away and how to make sure it was spent on the right causes .
Whether it is the quest for a legacy , the desire to change the world , the determination not to spoil one 's children or simply the tax code , Americans - wealthy and not so wealthy - are giving their dollars away by the lorry load .
And the rest of the world has a long way to catch up .

The Embarrassment of Riches will be broadcast on 19 May at 1100 BST ( 1000 GMT ) on BBC Radio 4 .
Do you agree with Matt Frei ?
Can others learn from the US culture of giving ?
What role should charity play in modern life ?
Lem 's works sold more than 27 million copies
He sold more than 27 million copies of his works , translated into about 40 languages , and a number were filmed .
His 1961 novel Solaris was made into a movie by Russian director Andrei Tarkovsky in 1971 and again by American Steven Soderbergh in 2002 .
Soderbergh 's version starred George Clooney and Natascha McElhone .
Thaw
Lem was born in 1921 in Lviv , then a Polish city but now part of Ukraine .
He studied medicine there before World War II .
In 1946 he moved to Krakow .
He concentrated on science fiction writing , a genre regarded by the Polish socialist government as fairly harmless in terms of censorship .
However , his first major novel , Hospital of the Transfiguration , went unpublished for eight years until the ideological thaw that followed Soviet leader Josef Stalin 's death in 1953 .
Other key works included The Cyberiad in 1965 .
After the collapse of communism in eastern Europe , Lem turned to writing reports on future trends , including computer crime and the ethical problems of the internet .

When you sit down to watch a DVD of your favourite film , the chances are that you are able to predict the exact sequence of events that is about to unfold .
Without our memories we would not only be unable to remember our past but perhaps more importantly predict the future .
Scientists believe they may have identified how the brain allows us to anticipate future events and detect when things do not turn out as expected .
Dr Dharshan Kumaran and Dr Eleanor Maguire at the Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging at University College London have shown that the hippocampus , the area of the brain believed to play a crucial role in learning and memory , makes predictions of what will happen next by automatically recalling an entire sequence of events in response to a single cue .
The research is published today in the journal Public Library of Science Biology .
Using an fMRI scanner , which uses changes in blood flow within the brain to provide measurements of brain activity , Dr Kumaran and Dr Maguire were able to show how the brain reacts to unexpected changes in a sequence of images .
A subject is shown a series of four images which are then repeated in a different order .
By changing the order of only the final two images , the researchers found that the hippocampus appeared to be predicting which image would come next and reacting when an unexpected image appeared .
" These experiments indicate that the hippocampus acts as a sort of comparison device , matching up past and present experience ” says Dr Kumaran .
" It does not appear to be reacting to novelty as such , but rather to discrepancies between what it expects to see and what it actually sees . "
The results imply that when the hippocampus is prompted by a cue , it recalls a sequence of associated memories , a process that may explain how seeing a particular person 's face or listening to a piece of music can trigger the recollection of an entire past experience .
Furthermore , the hippocampus would appear to perform a critical comparison between our past and present experiences alerting us to unexpected occurrences in our environment , such as changed layout .
" Patients with damaged hippocampi , such as those with Alzheimer 's Disease , often have trouble remembering sequences of events or finding their way around " explains Dr Kumaran .
" This would seem to be because the damaged hippocampus is unable to rapidly bind together the many different components of our experiences into a coherent whole . ”

Rats engage in “ metacognition ” :
They know what they do n’t know
Scientists have long known that humans , higher primates , dolphins and some birds demonstrate “ metacognition ” — the ability to think about thinking .
We know when we know something , and we also know when we do n’t know something .
But now a study has shown that even rats can demonstrate metacognition .
Jonathon Crystal , a neuroscientist at the University of Georgia at Athens , working with his student Alison Foote , figured out a clever experiment to test rats ’ awareness of their thinking .
They presented the rats with a “ sound classification ” test :
They trained the rats to associate a long , 8 - second burst of static with pushing one particular lever , and then trained them to associate a short , 2 - second burst of static with a different lever .
They ’d play one of the two sounds , and if the rats pushed the correct lever , they ’d get six food pellets ; pushing the wrong lever got them nothing .
The rats quickly learned to distinguish the two sounds by duration , and ate tons of pellets .
The scientists also offered the rats another opportunity for food :
When they heard a burst of static , they could simply stick their noses in a food trough and get half the reward — three pellets .
But the rats preferred to push the levers , because they were good at distinguishing the two sounds , and it gave them a much bigger reward .
Then things got interesting .
The scientists made the test harder .
They started playing bursts of static that were of intermediate length — four seconds , five seconds , six seconds — and thus harder to classify as “ long ” or “ short ” .
Suddenly , the rats decided to forgo the test and simply stick their noses in the food trough to get the smaller reward .
Apparently , the rats realized that they were now unlikely to pass this much - harder test , so they skipped it .
As the scientists put it in a press release :
“ Our research showed that the rats know when they do n’t know the answer to a question , ” said Crystal .
I confess I find it mindblowing how often we discover the complexity of the mental lives of seemingly dumb animals .
Octopuses in captivity play complex games to alleviate boredom ; grey parrots grasp the concept of zero ; and now rats demonstrate a level of self - awareness about their cognitive limitations that many humans do n’t possess .

In the world of philosophy , those who make the active claim that God does not exist are often viewed as extremists .
Taking a positive stand about the nonexistence of God is considered akin to claiming that all forms of matter , energy and consciousness have already been discovered , and that there is nothing new to be learned from the universe .
The simple fact that scientific truths are constantly being overturned is considered reasonable justification for a form of scientific agnosticism , which is generally expanded to include the vague possibility of the existence of a supernatural being such as gods .
Since we do not know everything about the universe , agnostics claim , it is impossible to rule out the possibility that gods might exist .
Thus ' strong atheism ' ' the positive declaration of the nonexistence of gods ' is generally viewed as an irrational position , ironically on par with the theist 's assertion that gods do exist .
Thus , like most positions in the post - Hegelian world , the truth is considered to lie somewhere in the midpoint between two extremes .
Wildly asserting that gods exists is as irrational as blindly asserting that they do not .
The most sensible position is to withhold judgment .
Those with any decent knowledge of philosophy know that the burden of proof lies squarely on the shoulders of those who assert that gods exist , and that no action is required from atheists to disprove the existence of gods .
However , the inevitable failures of all attempts to prove the existence of gods never seems to move the theist position into the ' not true ' category ' merely into the ' not proven but possible ' category .
In this essay , I will endeavor to give it just a little push over the line .
Like most problems in philosophy , the conflict stems from imprecisions in definition .
' God ' is a notoriously fluid concept , able to slosh fashionably into almost any mental container .
God can be defined as a ' higher power , ' or ' love , ' or ' energy , ' or ' nature , ' or ' an old man on a cloud , ' or ' the energy that binds the universe together ' or ' the first cause ' or ' hope , ' etc .
Naturally , no philosophical discussions can retain any coherence in the face of such wildly amorphous ' and often contradictory ' definitions .
Similarly , the definition of ' existence ' is often confused .
Does ' existence ' mean ' any form of matter , energy or consciousness that could conceivably exist in this or any other universe , ' or does it mean ' a Christian deity whose son came back from the dead ' ?
Does it mean ' that which is composed of matter or energy , ' or ' that which I believe with all my heart to exist ' ?
Of course , if ' gods ' and ' existence ' is defined in a tautological manner , no advance in knowledge is achieved .
If ' gods ' are defined as spiritual beings discoverable through faith , and ' existence ' is defined to include that which is discoverable through faith , nothing is gained .
' Existence ' must be an objective state , and ' knowledge ' must be an objective methodology .
Now , for science , ' existence ' is a relatively simple concept ' it is defined as that which consists of either matter or energy .
This is quite different from ' accuracy , ' which is the correlation between concepts and the behavior of matter and energy in the real world .
A concept has accuracy ' or validity ' if it precisely predicts or describes the behavior of matter and energy in the real world .
This , of course , is the basis of the scientific method , which is that all human concepts must bow to the empiricism of physical evidence .
Or , to put it another way , in any conflict between consciousness and matter , consciousness must give way , since consciousness can contain errors , but matter cannot .
With this ( admittedly brief ) introduction in place , we are a good deal closer to understanding the conflict between strong and weak atheists .
The central question about the existence of gods ' no matter how defined ' is this : are gods subject to physical laws ?
If gods are subject to physical laws , then the first law that gods are subject to is this : since existence is defined as that which is composed of either matter or energy , if gods exist , they must be composed of either matter or energy .
The opposite corollary must also be true .
If gods are not composed of matter or energy , then gods by definition do not exist .
Since ' existence ' is defined as that which is composed of matter or energy , ' non-existence ' must be that which possesses neither matter nor energy .
Thus to argue that gods exist despite a total absence of matter or energy is to argue that existence equals non-existence , which is a complete contradiction .
If I define an ' orange ' as a round citrus fruit that is orange in color , I cannot include in that definition an invisible orange that is the opposite of round , the opposite of citrus , the opposite of fruit , and the opposite of orange .
( I mean , I suppose could , but who would believe that I was serious ' or even sane ? )
If gods are subject to physical laws , then physical evidence is really the only methodology by which we can ascertain that gods exist .
Of course , this does not require direct physical evidence ' we cannot perceive black holes directly , but we know that they exist due to the effects of their gravity wells on surrounding matter , as well as the flashes of energy that are released as captured matter crosses the event horizon .
But since ' existence ' is defined as that which is composed of matter or energy , the scientific proof of existence must be some evidence of that matter or energy .
' Evidence ' is basically defined as that which impacts our physical senses in some manner ' either directly , or through some translating device such as a spectrograph or an oscilloscope .
Since our physical senses are organs designed to transmit the effects of matter and energy , it is essentially through the evidence of the senses that we can determine the existence or nonexistence of things .
If I argue that something exists , but that there is no way to detect it , my argument contradicts itself .
Let 's say I tell a deaf man that I hear a deep , loud sound coming from a speaker .
If he lays his hand on it and feels no vibrations , he has every right to be skeptical .
If I say that this loud sound does not have vibrations , he may then pull out his trusty microphone or other sound wave detector .
If this instrument detects no sound in the vicinity , can I still tell him that this loud sound is occurring ?
At some point , if my definition of ' loud sound ' basically boils down to ' that which is the opposite of any evidence that a loud sound is occurring , ' then clearly my approach to truth needs a little work !
This approach helps clarify the truth - value of the proposition that gods do not exist .
If gods are subject to physical laws , then sensual evidence of some sort is required to determine the existence of gods .
If gods are not subject to physical laws , then gods do not exist by definition , since that which is not subject to physical laws ' i.e. is not composed of matter or energy ' does not exist .
If gods are subject to physical laws , important ramifications follow .
Since gods must be bound by physical laws , miracles are impossible , since miracles are by definition violations of physical laws .
Similarly , gods cannot be omniscient and all - powerful , since both attributes would violate the basic tenets of physical laws .
Omniscience would require instantaneous knowledge of all matter , past , present and future , which is clearly impossible , while omnipotence would require the ability to break the bounds of physical laws , which brings us back to the realm of nonexistence .
If gods are subject to physical laws , then religion makes no sense whatsoever , and praying to gods makes about as much sense as worshiping a black hole , begging the Sun to grant you favors , or circumcising your son to appease the speed of light .
If gods are not subject to physical laws , then the concept of ' gods ' is synonymous with the concept of non-existence , which makes religion even more deranged .
Then , rather than praying to the moon , you would be in fact praying to the empty space between the Earth and the moon .
Why is there such opposition to the proposition that gods do not exist ?
Many people I have talked to with regards to strong atheism feel extremely uncomfortable asserting that gods do not exist .
Or , to be more precise , they feel extremely uncomfortable telling Christians , say , that the Christian god does not exist .
Rather than confront faithful believers with the hollow falsehood of their imaginary worship , they redefine ' God ' within their own minds as ' a potential form of matter or energy that has not been discovered yet , ' or ' that which could exist in an alternate universe , ' or something to that effect .
This allows them to continue breaking bread ' or least avoiding open conflict ' with those addicted to superstitious nonsense .
However , it could be argued that this is a fairly cowardly position .
Either a criterion for determining truth exists , or it does not .
If such a criterion exists , then it must be objective , and based on the evidence of the senses and reason , which precludes the existence of any form of religious deities .
If no such criterion exists , then both everything and nothing is true , and agnosticism , atheism , superstition , religion and the steadfast belief that shoes can fly and sing songs are all equally valid .
If an objective criterion for truth exists , then it cannot logically be applied according to whim , the expediency of the moment , or only in situations that feel emotionally comfortable .
If you wish to take a stand for rationality and truth , then I for one completely applaud you ' and sympathize with the attendant social difficulties that often result .
If , however , you take a stand for rationality and truth , but then sit back down whenever anybody gets upset , there 's very little point getting up to begin with .

LIBOIL
Liboil is a library of simple functions that are optimized for various CPUs .
These functions are generally loops implementing simple algorithms , such as converting an array of N integers to floating - point numbers or multiplying and summing an array of N numbers .
Such functions are candidates for significant optimization using various techniques , especially by using extended instructions provided by modern CPUs ( Altivec , MMX , SSE , etc. ) .
Many multimedia applications and libraries already do similar things internally .
The goal of this project is to consolidate some of the code used by various multimedia projects , and also make optimizations easier to use by a broader range of applications .
As of the liboil - 0.3.0 release , I 'm actively encouraging other open - source projects to begin using liboil .
I 'm happy to do much of work converting projects to use liboil , and especially , adding function classes and implementations to liboil that may be needed .
Liboil does not require GCC to build , but since it uses GCC - style inline assembly heavily , using GCC is strongly recommended .
Versions of GCC prior to 3.2 are known to have problems compiling liboil correctly .
GLib - 2.0 is recommended to build a few of the examples , but is not required for anything that is installed .
Liboil may be modified and distributed in accordance with a very liberal license commonly referred to as " Two - Clause BSD " .
This license was chosen to make liboil useful to as many open - source projects as possible , and has the side effect of also allowing liboil to be used by proprietary applications .
Overview
Liboil has a number of function classes , which are primarily seen by a developer using the library as actual functions .
One such function is : void oil_tablelookup_u8 ( uint8 _t * dest , int dstr , uint8 _t * src , * int sstr , uint8 _t * table , int tablestride , int n ) ;
This function performs a table lookup for each element in the src array , and puts the results in the dest array .
In actuality , oil_tablelookup_u8 is currently implemented as a preprocessor macro that generates the correct code to call an indirect function .
Each function class has one or more function implementations , which are real functions that perform the exact same action as defined by the documentation for the function .
Each class has one implementation that is the reference implementation .
This reference implmentation is used to test the accuracy of other implementations .
Presumably , the non-reference implementations can perform the action faster than the reference implementation .
Thus , the liboil initialization code ( at runtime ) checks each implementation in a class to determine the fastest implementation .
Once this is done , the class 's indirect function pointer points to the optimal implementation .
After this , any calls to the function class ( such as oil_tablelookup_u8 ( ) described above ) will automatically be routed to the fastest implementation .
Implementations can be disabled either at compile time ( e.g. , assembly code for the wrong architecture ) or at run time ( e.g. , implementation uses unsupported opcodes ) .
This is done automatically .
In addition , implementations may be disabled because they do not produce the same results as the reference implementation .
All of the function classes will be API and ABI stable through the lifetime of the 0.3 series .
In addition , the 0.4 series will include a compatibility library that will provide the 0.3 ABI .
This allows multiple liboil - using libraries to be linked into the same application without regard to using the same liboil ABI .
New ABI versions ( 0.4 , 0.5 , etc. ) are expected no less than 6 months apart .
It is planned that all future versions of liboil will support at least two liboil ABI versions in this way .
The Project
Liboil has essentially two separate subprojects : development of the Liboil core ( essentially completed ) , and development of function classes useful to applications .
As time and interest permit , I modify applications and libraries to use liboil , create function classes to support those applications , and occasionally write some optimized implementations .
In general , hacking on Liboil does not require knowledge of assembly language .
Many implementations are written in C .
Some use compiler intrisics that generate assembly for MMX or SSE instructions .

The Industrial Revolution and the origin of the Modern Age It 's been obvious and has disturbed me for some time the way in which supposed “ liberals ” demonize private enterprise and those institutional vehicles which comprise it — companies and corporations — as the veritable Princes of Darkness .
A liberal friend appraised me recently of the extent to which departments and classes at a local university are continually boiling in contempt for corporations as institutions , derogating them as hives of villainy and greed .
This long - time liberal mantra is woefully off the mark .
With regard to the pharmaceutical industry — one of the most vilified of modern corporate endeavors — Andrew Sullivan recently put it well ( hat tip , Instapundit ) , in expressing his gratitude for the innovations which have created the medicines that are currently saving his life : Thank God for the evil pharmaceutical companies .
One day , when the history of this period is written , I have a feeling we will look back with astonishment as we recognize that advances in medical science , particularly pharmaceuticals , were arguably one of the most significant developments of this era .
And yet the people who pioneered these breakthroughs were … demonized and attacked .
Baffling and bizarre .
I 'm merely grateful the attacks have n't stopped the research progress .
They 've merely slowed it .
Of course , it is n't just pharmaceutical firms that have progressed technologically with blazing speed in recent years .
Companies and corporations have had tremendous impact on technological advances across the board , from the computers we internet upon , to the Internet itself ( after the initial impetus provided by Federally - funded academic R&D ) , to the DVD , CD and before that videotape and audiotape technologies that have transformed our home musical and film experience ; aircraft technologies which have brought the world so much closer together — the list goes on and on .
The fact is that the modern industrial age , in combination with the scientific revolution , and organized along the lines of the modern American model of society ( which has now been transferred , more or less , to many another country around the world ) has created the only instance in history where the bulk of the population of affected areas can enjoy a life of ordinary ( what we think of as “ common ” nowadays ) , healthy , leisured , literate , decency .
Nor does the liberal chorus just target modern - day entrepreneurship , but also directs its ire back to the beginnings of the industrial revolution which occurred at this point a couple of centuries ago .
As a liberal commenter on a political mailing list recently put it :
The industrial revolution , not just here but in Europe , ushered in an era of greed , tenements , poverty , alcoholism , disease , and many other adverse side effects .
Read your history .
Well , I 've read quite a bit of history , and looking back at the origins of the industrial age in the 18th and 19th centuries , it 's clear that in pre-industrial rural areas the poverty and disease were even greater — that 's why the rural poor poured into the cities during the industrial revolution in the first place .
As Jacob Bronowski put it , in his fine book ( and PBS television series ) The Ascent of Man : 1
We dream that the country was idyllic in the eighteenth century , a lost paradise [… ] .
This is a fable , and George Crabbe , who was a country parson and knew the villager 's life at first hand , was so enraged by it that he wrote an acid , realistic poem in reply .
Yes , thus the Muses sing of happy Swains ,
Because the Muses never knew their pains .
O'ercome by labour and bow'd down by time ,
Feel you the barren flattery of a rhyme ?
The country was a place where men worked from dawn to dark , and the labourer lived not in the sun , but in poverty and darkness .
As Bronowski points out , the tenements of the industrial age were a great step up for vast numbers of people .
Then again , the industrial revolution was founded to a very considerable degree by visionary folk who had the interests of the people in mind .
Read about the Lunar Society in Britain ( Bronowski talks about it ) , and individuals like Josiah Wedgwood who provided high - grade pottery ware for common people on the cheap .
There were many like him .
Bronowski continues : 2
The men who made the Industrial Revolution are usually pictured as hardfaced businessmen with no other motive than self - interest .
That is certainly wrong .
For one thing , many of them were inventors who had come into business that way .
And for another , a majority of them were not members of the Church of England but belonged to a puritan tradition in the Unitarian and similar movements .
John Wilkinson was much under the influence of his brother - in - law Joseph Priestley , later famous as a chemist , but who was a Unitarian minister and was probably the pioneer of the principle , “ the greatest happiness of the greatest number . ”
He goes on : 3 It took a hundred years before the ideals of the Lunar Society became a reality in Victorian England .
When it did come , the reality seemed commonplace , even comic , like a Victorian picture postcard .
It is comic to think that cotton underwear and soap could work a transformation in the lives of the poor .
Yet these simple things — coal in an iron range , glass in the windows , a choice of food — were a wonderful rise in the standard of life and health .
By our standards , the industrial towns were slums , but to people who had come from a cottage , a house in a terrace was a liberation from hunger , from dirt , and from disease ; it offered a new wealth of choice .
The bedroom with the text on the wall seems funny and pathetic to us , but for the working class wife it was the first experience of private decency .
Probably the iron bedstead saved more women from childbed fever than the doctor 's black bag , which was itself a medical innovation .
The poster of the anti-industrial screed , however , continues :
There are both pros and cons to the Industrial Revolution , but undeniably , it ushered in an era of selfishness and greed , along with personification of big business as having the same rights as individuals , that has only escalated through the years .
Eventually the bubble will pop .
The industrial age has been going on now for some 200 years , but “ eventually the bubble will pop ” ?
If the commenter keeps on wishing , maybe someday he 'll get his fondest dream — or maybe it'll turn into a nightmare .
Be careful what one wishes for !
Notice too that he lists greed at the top of the supposed evils ushered in by the industrial age .
This is a tragically misguided charge .
Let 's see what Alexis de Tocqueville , profound French observer of the early United States , had to say on this subject in his classic study Democracy in America while observing where the two eras , ancient and modern , lay in close juxtaposition — separated only by a river — in pre-Civil War America .
We 've had occasion to quote this passage before , but let 's review it one more time : 4
So the traveller who lets the current carry him down the Ohio till it joins the Mississippi sails , so to say , between freedom and slavery ; and he has only to glance around him to see instantly which is best for mankind .
On the left bank of the river the population is sparse ; from time to time one sees a troop of slaves loitering through half - deserted fields ; the primeval forest is constantly reappearing ; one might say that society had gone to sleep ; it is nature that seems active and alive , whereas man is idle .
But on the right bank a confused hum proclaims from afar that men are busily at work ; fine crops cover the fields ; elegant dwellings testify to the taste and industry of the workers ; on all sides there is evidence of comfort ; man appears rich and contented ; he works . [… ]
These contrasting effects of slavery and of freedom are easy to understand ; they are enough to explain the differences between ancient civilization and modern .
On the left bank of the Ohio work is connected with the idea of slavery , but on the right with well - being and progress ; on the one side it is degrading , but on the other honorable ; on the left bank no white laborers are to be found , for they would be afraid of being like the slaves ; for work people must rely on the Negroes ; but one will never see a man of leisure on the right bank : the white man 's intelligent activity is used for work of every sort . [ … ]
The white man on the right bank , forced to live by his own endeavors , has made material well - being the main object of his existence ; as he lives in a country offering inexhaustible resources to his industry and continual inducements to activity , his eagerness to possess things goes beyond the ordinary limits of human cupidity ; tormented by a longing for wealth , he boldly follows every path to fortune that is open to him ; he is equally prepared to turn into a sailor , pioneer , artisan , or cultivator , facing the labors or dangers of these various ways of life with even constancy ; there is something wonderful in his resourcefulness and a sort of heroism in his greed for gain .
[ emphasis added – Imp . ]
The American on the left bank scorns not only work itself but also enterprises in which work is necessary to success ; living in idle ease , he has the tastes of idle men ; money has lost some of its value in his eyes ; he is less interested in wealth than in excitement and pleasure and expends in that direction the energy which his neighbor puts to other use ; he is passionately fond of hunting and war ; he enjoys all the most strenuous forms of bodily exercise ; he is accustomed to the use of weapons and from childhood has been ready to risk his life in single combat .
Slavery therefore not only prevents the white men from making their fortunes but even diverts them from wishing to do so .
The constant operation of these opposite influences throughout two centuries in the English North American colonies has in the end brought about a vast difference in the commercial capabilities of southerners and northerners .
Today the North alone has ships , manufactures , railways , and canals .
Thus , we see what “ greed ” together with industriousness and science brings us as a society — the origin of the modern age and the good life for all .
As stated before , this is the only instance in history where the majority of the people are able to enjoy a life of what we think of as “ common , ” healthy , leisured , literate , decency .
Despite the existence of some aesthetic drawbacks to the modern “ rat race , ” the idea that we should just throw up our hands and eliminate ( or at a minimum throw verbal manure on ) this goose that has laid a very golden egg , and age — while essentially consigning the bulk of the world 's population back into wretched poverty — is frankly ridiculous .

There are other articles you might find interesting here , too .
UPDATE : 2005-09-08 15:40 UT : Joel at the terrific Far Outliers ( just my kind of blog ! ) has linked to this piece , with an article entitled “ Impearls on Entrepreneurism and Its Enemies , ” writing : “ Impearls is back to blogging more regularly in his trademark long and thoughtful essays with footnotes .
His latest post bemoans the derision of all corporate entrepreneurism by too many on the political left . [ … ]
The whole essay is worth reading , but I 'll cite just a couple of his supporting quotes . ” [… ]
Beyond quoting from quotes that I mention , Joel makes the connection with a recent Virginia Postrel piece in Forbes on “ Criminalizing Science , ” which I 'd seen but had n't made the connection with this subject .
Thanks , Joel !
Joel goes on to ask : “ Where do these truly evangelical beliefs of the secular left come from ?
Medieval agrarian repulsion at urban corruption ( like the Moravian Brethren ) ?
High - born disdain for the commoners who produced the surplus wealth that funded noble endeavors ?
A combination of both ? ” I wonder about that too .
UPDATE : 2005-09-08 15:45 UT : Jim Bennett at his splendid Albion 's Seedling ( Anglosphere.com ) , which I should have linked to long since except it fell through the cracks in my brain , linked to this piece in the context of an article on “ What 's This ‘ Exit ’ Stuff All About ? , ” described as “ the transition point in human history where production becomes in general a more effective means of survival and prosperity than predation . ”
After discussing this , Jim notes that : “ Our society has navigated the Exit so successfully that many people have entirely forgotten what life before the Exit was like .
Some of these idiots are described here . ” [ pointing at Impearls ' piece ]

UPDATE : 2005-09-08 16:00 UT : Ken Talton in his intriguing Brickmuppet Blog linked to Impearls , writing : Via Dr. Reynolds
I found a link to this excellent piece over at Impearls on the industrial revolution and its real legacy .
A very thoughtfull bit and personally timely since I just had a conversation on this subject with someone on campus who was convinced that the industrial revolution was a terrible thing and that we should stop it from happening in the third world .
I 've heard this before and the impression that some people have is that industrialization is increasing poverty in the developing world .
Poppycock !
Those shanty towns on the outskirts of 3rd world cities … they , like the tenaments of our 19th century are filled with people who ( usually ) came there of their own free will because it is a STEP UP from their previous condition .
To us this seems unreal as we are living … well … in conditions that are better still precisely because that the industrial revolution happened .
Living at a subsistance level is not cool when its not a vacation , but rather the only thing you 'll ever know … it SUCKS !
Ken also points to a fine article by Baron Bodissey in Gates of Vienna called “ Visualize Industrial Collapse , ” which I might have seen myself had I not violated my own edict by not reading the Belmont Club every day !
UPDATE : 2005-09-09 21:50 UT : Richard A. Heddleson wrote in an e-mail : Events from industrial revolution through to the pharmaceuticals today are seen as evil because they are agents of change , which all people find threatening , and because they utilize mysterious knowledge unavailable to the common person , again something people find threatening .
UPDATE : 2005-09-09 22:05 UT : Another reader yclept Michael wrote in : thoughts about rural areas… .
Many of my grandfather 's generation are still alive today and their childhood 's were on a depression era farm .
Me too — my mother and her siblings and parents actually , and other relatives too .
At a recent visit , one of the comments that stuck in my mind was this ……
“ We did n't realize it was the Great Depression until a man showed up offering a free government mule . ”
Life was so hard scrabble , so busy , before dawn to after sunset they did n't have a chance to notice the Great Depression .
That , in turn , was a bit of a return , for rural folk , to conditions as they had predominated — for the poor , anyway ; for peasants — throughout history prior to the previous century .
That put a lot of stuff in perspective for me .
Just so .

UPDATE : 2005-09-09 22:20 UT : Jerry Brennan e-mailed : The book “ Capitalism and the Historians ” , edited by F A Hayek , sheds much light on attitudes regarding the “ industrial revolution ” in England .
In a different vein , in a speech in January 2003 http://www.crichton-official.com/speeches/speeches_quote04.html
Michael Crichton , in a very different context , had some comments which might be add to your point :
Let 's think back to people in 1900 in , say , New York .
If they worried about people in 2000 , what would they worry about ?
Probably :
Where would people get enough horses ?
And what would they do about all the horseshit ?
Horse pollution was bad in 1900 , think how much worse it would be a century later , with so many more people riding horses ?
But of course , within a few years , nobody rode horses except for sport .
And in 2000 , France was getting 80 % its power from an energy source that was unknown in 1900 .
Germany , Switzerland , Belgium and Japan were getting more than 30 % from this source , unknown in 1900 .
Remember , people in 1900 did n't know what an atom was .
They did n't know its structure .
They also did n't know what a radio was , or an airport , or a movie , or a television , or a computer , or a cell phone , or a jet , an antibiotic , a rocket , a satellite , an MRI , ICU , IUD , IBM , IRA , ERA , EEG , EPA , IRS , DOD , PCP , HTML , internet .
interferon , instant replay , remote sensing , remote control , speed dialing , gene therapy , gene splicing , genes , spot welding , heat - seeking , bipolar , prozac , leotards , lap dancing , email , tape recorder , CDs , airbags , plastic explosive , plastic , robots , cars , liposuction , transduction , superconduction , dish antennas , step aerobics , smoothies , twelve - step , ultrasound , nylon , rayon , teflon , fiber optics , carpal tunnel , laser surgery , laparoscopy , corneal transplant , kidney transplant , AIDS None of this would have meant anything to a person in the year 1900 .
They would n't know what you are talking about .
As Crichton implies , it 's just this kind of multiplicative effect which modern industrial techniques enable .
It 's obvious when you think about it : the only way that the average Joe person can feed , clothe and house himself and his or her family , transport them , holiday , and play , all like a king of yore , is if he himself as a typical worker produces enough of whatever it is he makes for a small army of other people .
Thus , when everybody 's products of a myriad of different types are economically distributed across the broad population , then just about everyone will be able to afford a spectrum of the items out there that he or she desires .
To date that 's only been possible by means of industrial methods , though as technology continues to rocket ahead , that may change and more and more become almost ( and perhaps actually ) biological in its approach to reproduction and growth .
See visionary physicist Freeman Dyson 's remarkable essay The World , the Flesh , and the Devil for insights on how this could proceed , as well as via techniques of nanotechnology now in their initial stages of development .
As Dyson says : Used wisely , [ this technology ] offers a rapid alleviation of all the purely economic difficulties of mankind .
It offers to rich and poor nations alike a rate of growth of economic resources so rapid that economic constraints will no longer be dominant in determining how people are to live .
In some sense this technology will constitute a permanent solution of man 's economic problems .
UPDATE : 2005-09-11 21:30 UT : Craig Newmark of Newmark 's Door has linked to Impearls ' piece , under the title “ Did the Industrial Revolution destroy Nirvana ?
No ! , ” commenting : “ Michael McNeil sharply replies to those who think the Industrial and Scientific Revolutions destroyed a wonderful way of life . ”
A commenter in Newmark 's Door named Jake ( apparently from my own home state of Montana ) made this point : I learned in my Victorian England class these items :
A technological discovery in agricultural threw a huge number of people off the farms and this excess of labor allowed the Industrial Revolution to begin .
That discovery was animal breeding and the need for fences to keep the livestock of each farm separate .
Most of the farm labor then were herders that tended to the livestock in common village fields .
Herders were no longer needed after fences were constructed .
The men who built the first factories did not know anything about running factories .
How could they ?
They had just been invented .
The terrible working conditions were a result of the owner 's ignorance .
However , the owners learned by experience and within 20 years working conditions improved dramatically .
As a result , productivity improved dramatically .
Actually , as Jacob Bronowski pointed out in his book : Mines and workshops had been dank , crowded and tyrannical long before the Industrial Revolution .
The factories simply carried on as village industry had always done , with a heartless contempt for those who worked in them .
Pollution from the factories was not new either .
Again , it was the tradition of the mine and the workshop , which had always fouled their environment .
We think of pollution as a modern blight , but it is not .
It is another expression of the squalid indifference to health and decency that in past centuries had made the Plague a yearly visitation .
What the industrial revolution did was bring these abuses into the spotlight , which led to their mitigation .
Another commenter , Kyle N. , responding to the same posting , made the point :
The article is spot on , furthermore , I would add that many of the socialistic Ideas which people on the left enjoy , came first from the early millionaire industrialists .
I would recommend the text book , “ The Age of Aristocracy , 1688 - 1830 , ” by William Willcox .
UPDATE : 2005-09-11 21:35 UT : The Economics Roundtable restated and linked to ( scroll down ) Craig Newmark 's posting above .
UPDATE : 2005-09-11 21:45 UT : John B. Chilton 's
The Emirates Economist has linked to this article , under the title “ The good old days ? :: Impearls , ” noting : ” This piece by Michael McNeil is receiving a lot of buzz in the blogosphere . ”
UPDATE : 2005-09-11 22:45 UT : A couple of comments made to the Far Outliers piece noted above deserve a response .
“ SOTS ” ( of South of the Suwannee ) writes : You may be impressed with Impearls ' footnotes , but the fact that he cites only one obscure source for his ( and apparently your ) contention that “ ‘ liberals ’ demonize private enterprise and those institutional vehicles which comprise it ” is a bit underwhelming .
So Alexis de Tocqueville is an “ obscure source ” ?
Oh , you must mean Jacob Bronowski !
Well , he may be obscure to you , but for me Bronowski ( Science and Human Values , The Western Intellectual Tradition , and especially The Common Sense of Science ) is one of my most respected sources .
Moreover , all he 's writing about in the sections of the indicated piece ( in The Ascent of Man ) is providing the background for the Industrial Revolution ; he never meant , nor was my referencing it intended , to specify a reference to “ liberals ” demonizing private enterprise — that I 'm providing myself from my own experiences .
“ SOTS ” continues : Moreover , Impearls ends his post with the following : “… the idea that we should just throw up our hands and eliminate ( or at a minimum throw verbal manure on ) this goose that has laid a very golden egg , and age — while essentially consigning the bulk of the world 's population back into wretched poverty — is frankly ridiculous . ”
What is truely ridiculous is the suggestion that “ liberals ” are intent on throwing civilization back into some pre-industrial agrarian hell .
Perhaps there is the possibility that the downside of modern ( corporate ) society can be civilized without destroying the benefits it brings .
I enjoy Impearls , but come on , this is a bit sophomoric .
Of course , most liberals do n't mean to throw civilization “ back into some pre-industrial hell , ” but since many of them do n't even recognize that there was a “ pre-industrial hell ” to be thrown back into , that does n't inspire much confidence .
The historical ignorance among many such people is profound , and frightening .
Beyond that , the above writer illustrates part of the problem , exhibiting the tendency and desire to tinker with the mechanism which has created the modern age so that , as he put it , the “ downside [ … ] can be civilized . ”
While I would be first to admit that there are downsides to modern industrial society and also that improvement is likely possible , I do n't have much confidence in the tinkering liberals would institute in this regard .
Was n't cutting into the original goose that laid the golden eggs in an attempt to improve it what killed that golden goose in the first place ?
As the liberal poster I was responding to in my original piece expressed it , from their point of view greed is the major problem — and as the quote from “ obscure ” Alexis de Tocqueville ought to have made clear , greed is a feature of the modern system , not a bug .
To usurp Churchill 's famous adage with regard to democracy : Capitalism is surely the worst system in the world — except for all the rest .
Next , Joel , founder and inspiration behind Far Outliers ( and one of my favorite people as a result ) , responded to SOTS 's posting as follows :
Yes , SOTS , it is a bit sophomoric , perhaps understandably so in reaction to the incessant , sophomoric demonization of anything “ corporate ” on the academic ( or alternative - weekly ) left .
I would n't use “ liberal ” the way Impearls did .
It is not at all a pejorative term in my usage , but “ left ” is starting to trend that way .
I regard the pejorative use of either “ liberal ” or “ corporate ” as a pair of shibboleths emblematic of ideological “ conservatives ” on the one hand , and “ progressives ” on the other .
I tend to agree with Joel in this characterization , and normally in my political writing , e.g. here in Impearls , I do n't speak of “ liberals ” per se ( who I often have little dispute with ) , but rather of leftists pure and simple .
Now , leftists of course oppose capitalism ; they want to overthrow it in lieu of socialistic “ solutions . ”
However , that does n't seem to be what 's happening in our society today , nor is that what I 'm talking about .
Rather it appears to be the liberals , or “ leftists lite ” in this regard , who have taken up the mantra of habitually derogating corporate life and culture in our civilization , and it is with regard to them ( and I 'm not using the term “ liberals ” here in a particularly pejorative sense ) that I 'm speaking .

Credit Card Debt : Why You May Be Doing Even Worse Than You Think .
You may have heard that the national average for U.S. household credit card bills is pushing $ 9,000 .
If you 've been comforting yourself by thinking , " Oh , I only have $ 7,000 in credit card debt , so I 'm doing better than average - I do n't need debt consolidation , " think again .
Financial experts will remind you that the $ 9,000 figure is skewed - in reality , more than half of American households pay off their credit card balances monthly or do n't use credit cards at all ; the majority of those who owe credit card debt owe much less than $ 9,000 .
In fact , less than 10 % of Americans owe that much - and many owe much more , tilting the average to the high end .
Who 's in the most trouble when it comes to credit cards ?
Often , it 's those with household incomes under $ 50,000 , according to MSN Money .
People fall into the vicious cycle of credit cards when they use cards for expenses beyond their means or even for day - to - day living expenses .
Once you start racking up those finance charges , and interest fees , it 's hard to escape .
That $ 7000 can easily turn into $ 9000 ... then $ 13000 ... then $ 17000 ... until you have a totally unmanageable burden .
That 's why consolidating your bills [ link to lead gen form at bottom of page ] is a good idea .
Academic claims rape cases down because porn use up Christian Avard
Published : Friday September 22 , 2006 Print This Email This
An academic has claimed to RAW STORY that a decline in reported rape of 85 % in the past 25 years can be tied to an increase in pornography consumption .
In a study for Northwestern University 's Public Law and Legal Theory Research Paper Series titled " Porn Up Rape Down , " Anthony D'Amato , a Leighton Professor of Law at Northwestern University , argues that the proliferation of pornography has lead to a sharp decline in rape across the United States .
According to a 2005 National Crime Victimization Survey , the national rate of rape decreased from 2.5 to 0.5 for every thousand people over a 30 - year span from 1973 to 2003 .
The explanations offered include less lawlessness associated with crack cocaine , women being taught to avoid unsafe situations , that more potential rapists are already in prison for other crimes , and sex education classes telling boys that " no means no . "
But in an interview with RAW STORY , D'Amato argues that these are minor factors and do not explain the decline in rape .
" Suppose you distribute free condoms to a country , and you find , five years later , that the birth rate has gone down 85 % .
Would you say that it 's just a cosmic coincidence or would you say that the distribution of condoms caused the drop in the rate of birth ?
The reasoning is the same for my position on rape : the causation factor is reasonably inferred , " said D'Amato .
In " Porn Up Rape Down , " D'Amato compiled data from the National Telecommunications and Information Administration .
In 2001 , the four states with the lowest per capita access to the Internet were Arkansas , Kentucky , Minnesota , and West Virginia .
The four with the highest per capita Internet access were Alaska , Colorado , New Jersey , and Washington .
When compared to Disaster Center 's figures for forcible rape for the years 1980 and 2000 , the four states with the lowest Internet access showed a 53 % aggregate per capita increase in rape , while the four states with the highest Internet access showed a 27 % decrease in incidence of rape .
" Critics argue that exposure to depictions of violence causes violent behavior , " said D'Amato .
" They say that rape is just a subcategory of this principle .
They could n't be more mistaken .
Exposure to violent movies , TV programs , or video games has NOT produced more social violence .
It has produced the opposite .
The amount of social violence per capita in the year 1900 when street gangs attacked pedestrians and murders were common far exceeds the incidence of violence today .
Sure , there is violent behavior , but when it happens it makes headlines .
Back then it happened so often that it was n't newsworthy . "
" It 's not a big mystery , " says Bruce David , Editorial Director of Hustler magazine .
" It 's consistent with all the research data we 've seen .
In countries where adult material is legal , generally speaking there is a decline in instances of rape and spousal abuse and we have also seen in places where adult material is illegal that the abuse of women can be rampant , like Afghanistan where women are shot in soccer stadiums . "
Will Ryder , Director of Hustler 's Barely Legal and Britney Rears video line wholeheartedly agrees .
" I have always felt this was an absurd claim and that quite the contrary would take place , due to the fact that most who view adult entertainment usually conclude their session with a self - satisfaction reward and are too damn tired to leave the house and rape somebody .
The last damn thing he wants to do is go out and hunt somebody down , " said Ryder .
D'Amato 's interest in the rape - pornography question began in 1970 , when he served as a consultant to President Nixon 's Commission on Obscenity and Pornography .
When the Commission found there was no connection between pornography and violent anti-social behavior , Nixon  according to D'Amato  was furious .
In the 1980s , President Reagan created a similar commission under Attorney General Edwin Meese , who D'Amato said " packed it with people who were on record denouncing pornography . "
In " Porn Up Rape Down " D'Amato wonders how the social facts could change so drastically in the decade between the Nixon and Reagan reports .
Critics contend that none of D'Amato 's conclusions make any sense .
" My experience with women across the U.S. is that women now do not report rape , " said Gail Dines , associate professor of Sociology and Women 's Studies at Wheelock College .
" I teach and speak on campuses all over and I know that only 34 % of rapes are ever reported and increasingly women are not believed when they tell their stories .
I also hear stories that when women do go forward , the college or university will clamp down on women .
Or the alleged rapist will get friends to harass her until she drops charges and terrorizes them out of reporting it .
This happens everywhere . "
Dines also disagreed with the National Victimization Survey conclusion that incidents of rape have decreased by 85 % .
" It does n't matter where the statistics come from because women are not reporting .
I very rarely meet a woman who has reported a rape .
It 's by far the exception rather that the rule . "
D'Amato believes the most important lesson people should take away from " Porn Up Rape Down " is to question the results of governmental reports .
" If people can learn to distrust the findings of governmental commissions , such as the Warren Report , the 9 - 11 report , or the Meese report on social violence , we would become a more free and democratic nation , " said D'Amato .
" Our government engineers these reports to shield the perpetrators or to promote the business interests of its cronies and campaign contributors .
As I tell my law students , the first thing you need to know about being a lawyer is not to trust the written word . "
But critics like Dines suggest that D'Amato  or those who reviewed his study  fail to understand the myriad factors that influence rape .
" What causes rape and violence against women is a very complicated issue .
No feminist I know would ever say that only pornography is the sole cause of rape .
There are multiple causes , " said Dines .
" To look at the causes of rape you have to look at multiple factors and variables and all I can say is it was reviewed by people who are not aware of the research that 's been going on or did not question the nature of debate he was using . "

Mr Pronk said the army had suffered defeats in Darfur
A military statement said Jan Pronk 's presence in Sudan " negatively affects the work of the armed forces " .
Mr Pronk wrote on his personal blog last week that heavy losses in Darfur were eroding Sudanese army morale .
Sudan is resisting strong international pressure to allow UN peacekeepers to try and end the conflict in Darfur .
Former armed forces spokesman General Mohammed Beshir Suleiman told the official Suna news agency that Mr Pronk 's comments were part of the West 's continuing efforts to get Sudan to accept UN troops into Darfur .
[ Jan Pronk is ] waging psychological warfare on the armed forces by propagating erroneous information

Darfur call by genocide survivors
The Sudanese foreign ministry said in a statement that Mr Pronk 's remarks were " not in line with his mandate " as a UN representative , but did not repeat the army 's call for him to leave .
But the BBC's Jonah Fisher in Khartoum says it may be just a matter of time before Mr Pronk is expelled , after making powerful enemies .
Janjaweed return
In the statement , the military complained that Mr Pronk had travelled around Sudan without government permission , illegally meeting rebels .
It also accused him of " waging psychological warfare on the armed forces by propagating erroneous information that casts doubts about the capability of the armed forces in maintaining security and defending the country " .

He wrote that there had been hundreds of casualties and prisoners taken , leading to a fall in morale and the sacking of generals .
He also said that pro-government Arab militias were again being mobilised in contravention of UN resolutions .
The Janjaweed militias are accused of widespread atrocities , even genocide .
A former Janjaweed fighter now living in London has told the BBC that Sudanese ministers gave express orders for the activities of his unit , which included rape and killing children .
He told the Newsnight programme that Janjaweed fighters would go into Darfur villages after they had been bombed by the air force .
The government has always denied backing the Janjaweed militias and says the problems in Darfur are being exaggerated for political reasons .
More than two million people have fled their homes during the three - year conflict in Darfur .
The UN Security Council has passed a resolution calling for 20,000 troops to be sent to Darfur to replace the 7,000 poorly equipped African Union troops who have failed to end the conflict .
Sudan has rejected the resolution , saying it would infringe on its sovereignty .

このような「利点」のカタログは確かにそのとおりであるが、かやの外の者が

進すべき目標は、これから述べる新しい糊で、より小く、より簡潔に、より汎
用的なモジュールを貼り合せるということである。
3. 関数の貼り合せ
二種類の糊のうち最初のものは単純な関数を貼り合せてより複雑な関数にする
ものである。これは簡単なリスト処理問題(リストの要素の足しあげ)で説明す ることができる。リストを
listof X ::= nil | cons X ( listof X )
[ ] の意味は nil [ 1 ] の意味は cons 1 nil [ 1,2,3 ] の意味は cons 1 ( cons 2 ( cons 3 nil ) )
sum nil = 0
sum ( cons num list ) = num + sum list
+---+ sum nil = | 0 | +---+ +---+ sum ( cons num list ) = num | + | sum list +---+
sum = reduce add 0
add x y = x + y
( reduce f x ) nil = x ( reduce f x ) ( cons a l ) = f a ( ( reduce f x ) l )
このようにして、sumをモジュール化したのでこの部品を再利用する利益を得る
ことができる。最も興味のあるのはreduceの部分である。これは、余分にプロ
グラミングをすることなく、リストの要素を掛け合せる関数を書くのに使える。
product = reduce multiply 1
anytrue = reduce or false
alltrue = reduce and true
cons 1 ( cons 2 ( cons 3 nil ) )
add 1 ( add 2 ( add 3 0 ) ) = 6
multiply 1 ( multiply 2 ( multiply 3 1 ) ) = 6
append a b = reduce cons b a
append [ 1,2 ] [ 3,4 ] = reduce cons [ 3,4 ] [ 1,2 ] = ( reduce cons [ 3,4 ] ) ( cons 1 ( cons 2 nil ) ) = cons 1 ( cons 2 [ 3,4 ] ) ) ( replacing cons by cons and nil by [ 3,4 ] ) = [ 1,2,3,4 ]
doubleall = reduce doubleandcons nil where doubleandcons num list = cons ( 2* num ) list
doubleandcons = fandcons double where double n = 2 * n fandcons f el list = cons ( f el ) list
fandcons f = cons .
f
( f . g ) h = f ( g h )
fandcons f el = ( cons . f ) el = cons ( f el ) したがって、 fandcons f el list = cons ( f el ) list
doubleall = reduce ( cons . double ) nil
doubleall = map double map f = reduce ( cons . f ) nil
summatrix = sum .
map sum
これだけの例があれば、ちょっとしたモジュール化が大いに役立つ可能性がある ことを納得するはずだ。単純な関数(sum ) を
「高階関数」といくつかの単純な関 数の合成としてモジュール化することにより、とくに余分にプログラミング努
力をすることなくリスト上の多くの関数を書きおろすのに使える、( reduce ) と
いう部品に到達した。リスト上の関数にとどまることはない。もうひとつの例
として、つぎに定義される、ラベル付順序ツリー
treeof X ::= node X ( listof ( treeof X ) )
1 o ／ ＼ ／ ＼ ／ ＼ 2 o o 3 | | | o 4
node 1 ( cons ( node 2 nil ) ( cons ( node 3 ( cons ( node 4 nil ) nil ) ) nil ) )
redtree f g a ( node label subtrees ) = f label ( redtree ' f g a subtrees ) redtree ' f g a ( cons subtree rest ) = g ( redtree f g a subtree ) ( redtree ' f g a rest ) redtree ' f g a nil = a
sumtree = redtree add add 0
add 1 ( add ( add 2 0 ) ( add ( add 3 ( add ( add 4 0 ) 0 ) ) 0 ) ) = 10
labels = redtree cons append nil
cons 1 ( append ( cons 2 nil ) ( append ( cons 3 ( append ( cons 4 nil ) nil ) ) nil ) ) = [ 1,2,3,4 ]
maptree f = redtree ( node . f ) cons nil
4. プログラムの貼り合せ
関数型言語が用意するもうひとつの新しい種類の糊はプログラム全体を貼り合
せることを可能にする。完成した関数プログラムは入力から出力への一つの関
数にすぎないことを思いおこせ。もし、fとgがそうしたプログラムであるなら、 ( g . f ) は一つのプログラムであり、入力( input)に適用すると
g ( f input )
この評価方式はfをできるだけ走らせないようにするので、「怠惰( 遅延)評価 」
と呼ばれている。これにより、ひとつのプログラムを多くの可能な答を構成
する生成器と適切なものを選ぶ選択器にモジュール化することが現実的なもの
となる。いくつかのシステムではプログラムをこのような方法で同時に走らせ
ることが可能であるが、関数型言語だけが、すべての関数について一律に遅延
評価を用い、プログラムの任意の部分がこの方法でモジュール化可能である。
遅延評価はおそらく関数プログラマのレパートリの中で最も強力なモジュール 化の道具である。
4.1 . ニュートン-ラプソン法による平方根
いくつかの数値計算アルゴリズムのプログラミングをすることで遅延評価の力
を説明しよう。先ず最初に、平方根を求めるニュートン-ラプソンのアルゴリ
ズムを考えよう。このアルゴリズムは数値Nの平方根を、初期近似値a0から始
めて、以下のルールを使って、どんどん改良していって、求める。
a( n+1 ) = ( a ( n ) + N/a( n ) ) / 2
a = ( a + N/a ) / 2 したがって、 2a = a + N/a a = N/a a*a = N a = squareroot ( N )
C N IS CALLED ZN HERE SO THAT IT HAS THE RIGHT TYPE X = A0 Y = A0 + 2 .*EPS C THE VALUE OF Y DOES NOT MATTER SO LONG AS ABS ( X-Y ) .
GT.EPS 100 IF ( ABS ( X-Y ) .LE.EPS ) GOTO 200 Y = X X = ( X + ZN/X ) / 2 . GOTO 100 200 CONTINUE C THE SQUARE ROOT OF ZN IS NOW IN X
ニュートン-ラプソンのアルゴリズムは近似値の列を計算するので、プロ
グラム中ではこれを、近似値のリストとして表現するのが自然である。各近似
値はその手前の近似値から次の関数によって導びく。
next N x = ( x + N/x ) / 2
[ a0 , f a0 , f ( f a0 ) , f( f ( f a 0 ) ) , ..]
repeat f a = cons a ( repeat f ( f a ) )
repeat ( next N ) a0
平方根発見器の残りの部分は、関数withinで、この関数は許容誤差と近似値
のリストを引数としてとり、そのリストを見て与えられた許容誤差よりも差の
小さい二つの連続する近似値を探す。これは次のように定義できる。
within eps ( cons a ( cons b rest ) ) = b , if abs ( a - b ) <= eps = within eps ( cons b rest ) , otherwise
sqrt a0 eps N = within eps ( repeat ( next N ) a0 )
relative eps ( cons a ( cons b rest ) ) = b , if abs ( a - b ) <= eps*abs b = relative eps ( cons b rest ) , otherwise
relativesqrt a0 eps N = relative eps ( repeat ( next N ) a0 )
4.2. 数値微分
easydiff f x h = ( f( x+h ) - f x ) / h
differentiate h0 f x = map ( easydiff f x ) ( repeat halve h0 ) halve x = x /
2
within eps ( differentiate h0 f x )
正しい値 + h に関連する誤差 項
a( i ) = A + B * ( 2**n ) *( h**n ) および、 a( i+1 ) = A + B *( h**n )
a( i+1 ) *( 2**n ) - a( i ) A = --------------------
2**n - 1
elimerror n ( cons a ( cons b rest ) ) = = cons ( ( b *( 2**n ) - a ) / ( 2**n - 1 ) ) ( elimerror n ( cons b rest ) )
order ( cons a ( cons b ( cons c rest ) ) ) = = round ( log2 ( ( a - c ) / ( b- c ) - 1 ) ) round x = x rounded to the nearest integer log2 x = the logarithm of x to the base 2
improve s = elimerror ( order s ) s
within eps ( improve ( differentiate h0 f x ) )
within eps ( improve ( improve ( improve ( differentiate h0 f x ) ) ) )
super s = map second ( repeat improve s ) second ( cons a ( cons b rest ) ) = b
within eps ( super ( differentiate h0 f x ) )
4.3 . 数値積分
easyintegrate f a b = ( f a + f b ) *( b- a ) /
2
integrate f a b = cons ( easyintegrate f a b ) ( map addpair ( zip ( integrate f a mid ) ( integrate f mid b ) ) ) where mid = ( a+ b ) /
2
zip ( cons a s ) ( cons b t ) = cons ( pair a b ) ( zip s t )
integrate f a b = integ f a b ( f a ) ( f b ) integ f a b fa fb = cons ( ( fa+ fb ) * ( b - a ) /2 ) ( map addpair ( zip ( integ f a m fa fm ) ( integ f m b fm fb ) ) ) where m = ( a+b ) / 2 fm = f m
within eps ( integrate f a b ) relative eps ( integrate f a b )
super ( integrate sin 0 4 ) improve ( integrate f 0 1 ) where f x = 1 /( 1+x *x )
5. 人工知能からの例
関数型言語が本来、強力なもので、それは、高階関数と遅延評価というふたつ
の新しい種類の糊をもつためであると主張した。この節ではより規模の大きい
例を人工知能からとり、この二つの糊をつかってどのように非常に単純
にプログラムすることが可能かを示す。
選択した例はα-β発見法というゲームプレイヤの状態がどのくらい良いものか
を見積るアルゴリズムである。このアルゴリズムはゲームがどのように展開す

ゲーム状態がpositionという型のオブジェクトで表現されているものとしよう。
この型はゲーム毎に変化するものになる。これについては何も仮定しない。あ

な関数があると仮定する。
moves : position -> listof position

-+-+- -+-+- -+-+- -+-+- | | | | | | | | | | O| | |O| -+-+- -+-+- -+-+- moves | X| = [ |X| , |X| ] -+-+- -+-+- -+-+- | | | | | |
関数movesがあれば、最初のステップはゲームツリーを構築することである。こ
のツリーはノードに状態のラベルが付いており、ノードの子はそのノードから
一手で到達可能な状態でラベル付けされたノードとなる。すなわち、もしノー

パターンは以下の高階関数を用いて表現できる。
reptree f a = node a ( map ( reptree f ) ( f a ) )
gametree p = reptree moves p

static : position -> number
このような静的評価の木が与えられた場合、そのなかの状態の正確な値は何で
あろうか。特にルートの状態に帰すべき値は何であろうか。その静的な値ではない、
なぜなら、その静的な値はおおまかな推測にすぎないからだ。あるノードに帰
すべき値はそのサブノードの正確な値から決定されるものでなければならない。
この決定は各プレイヤが可能な手のうち最良のものを選ぶという仮定を用いて

導する手を選択することになろう。同様にして、対戦者は正確な値が最小のサ
ブノードに誘導する手を選択することになる。コンピュータと対戦者は交互に
手を打つことを仮定すれば、ノードの正確な値は、コンピュータの番ならば、 関数maximiseが計算した値であり、対戦者の番であれば、minimiseが計算した 値である。
maximise ( node n sub ) = max ( map minimise sub ) minimise ( node n sub ) = min ( map maximise sub )
maximise ( node n nil ) = n maximise ( node n sub ) = max ( map minimise sub ) minimise ( node n nil ) = n minimise ( node n sub ) = min ( map maximise sub )
evaluate = maximise .

これまでは、単純なミニマックス法についてのみ言及してきた。α-βアルゴリ
ズムの核心は、多くの場合、ツリー全体を見ることなくmaxmiseあるいは minimiseの値を計算することができるという観察にある。以下のツリーを考え よ。
max ／ ＼ ／ ＼ ／ ＼ ／ ＼ min min ／ ＼ ／ ＼ ／ ＼ ／ ＼ 1 2 0 ?
maximise = max . maximise '
maximiseの定義からmaxを因子抽出することはやさしい。以下のようになる。
maximise ' ( node n nil ) = cons n nil maximise ' ( node n l ) = map minimise l = map ( min . minimise ' ) l = map min ( map minimise ' l ) = mapmin ( map minimise ' l ) where mapmin = map min
mapmin ( cons nums rest ) = cons ( min nums ) ( omit ( min nums ) rest )
omit pot nil = nil omit pot ( cons nums rest ) = omit pot rest , if minleq nums pot = cons ( min nums ) ( omit ( min nums ) rest ) , otherwise
minleq nil pot = false minleq ( cons num rest ) pot = true , if num < =pot = minleq rest pot , otherwise
evaluate = max . maximise ' .
maptree static .
prune 8 . gametree
別の最適化をこの評価器にほどこすことができる。たとえば、今述べたα-βア
ルゴリズムは、最良の手筋を最初に考えれば、最も良く働く。それは、もし、
非常に良い手を見付けたらそれより悪い手は、対戦者がそれに対して少くとも
ひとつは良い応手をもつということを示す以外は必要のないものである。それ
ゆえに、各ノードごとにサブツリーをソートし、コンピュータの手番のときは
大きい順に、そうでないときには小さい順にならべたいとおもう。これは以下
のような関数を書くことで実現できる。
highfirst ( node n sub ) = node n ( sort higher ( map lowfirst sub ) ) lowfirst ( node n sub ) = node n ( sort ( not.higher ) ( map highfirst sub ) ) higher ( node n1 sub1 ) ( node n2 sub2 ) = n1>n2
evaluate = max . maximise ' .
highfirst .
maptree static .
prune 8 . gametree
taketree n = redtree ( nodett n ) cons nil nodett n label sub = node label ( take n sub )
もうひとつの改良は枝刈りの洗練である。上のプログラムは状態が動的なもの
であるにもかかわらず、固定の深さの先読をする。たとえばチェスでクィーン
取りがかかっている状態なのにそれ以上先を読まないという判断をするかもし
れない。いくつかの「動的」な状態を定義し、これらの状態のところで先読み
が止ってしまわないようにするのが普通である。関数「dynamic」がこのような状態を識別できるものと仮定すると関数 pruneの定義に一行の等式を加えるだけでよい。
prune 0 ( node pos sub ) = node pos ( map ( prune 0 ) sub ) , if dynamic pos

Jesus of Suburbia -- Has He Risen Again in Houston , Texas ?
Jose de Jesus preaches an unusual gospel : no sin , hell , the devil , or damnation .
March 6 , 2007  --
A few weeks ago , in a tattoo parlor in the hip art deco district of Miami Beach , people were lining up to get " 666 " tattooed on their bodies , and then smiling through their pain .
But these are not devil worshipers .
They see themselves as devout followers of Jesus Christ .
But the major difference that separates them from other Christians around the world is that the Jesus Christ they worship is alive and well -- and living in the suburbs of Houston .
These people belong to a new movement devoted to a man who calls himself the Second Coming of Jesus , and also claims the title of Antichrist , which to him is the next incarnation of Jesus on earth , not an evil being .
To show their devotion , some followers ink themselves with " 666 . "
One follower said , " I just want to make sure it 's visible , that everyone knows my life belongs to the man . "
Another said , " I want everyone to know I 'm one of the antichrists . "
They and others like them are fervently devoted , some say fanatically , to a 60 - year - old Puerto Rican whose legal name , to his pleasure , is Jose de Jesus , or " Jose of Jesus . "
He counts followers in more than 30 countries ; some say they total more than a million .
But where does this man , who claims to be God , live ?
Not where you might expect :
He resides with his wife in a suburban community just outside Houston .
The Birth of ' Jesus '
When asked to explain who he is , de Jesus responds : " Jesus Christ , man , the second manifestation , the Second Coming of Christ . "
He acknowledges that " it bothers a lot of people " that he calls himself Jesus .
De Jesus ' beginning was anything but grand .
Born in Puerto Rico , de Jesus grew up poor , living in government housing .
He stole for a living to pay for his teenage heroin addiction and admits to eight felony charges that put him behind bars for nine months .
Like many , de Jesus says he was born again in prison .
From there he moved to the United States , where he became involved in church youth groups , and eventually a minister in Boston .
But it was a vision , de Jesus says , that turned him from man of God to being God .
" The same spirit that was in Jesus of Nazareth , and the same spirit is in me .
He came to me .
He [ integrated ] with my person in 1973 . " de Jesus says this happened when two angels came to him in a vision , and while he admits there 's no real way for him to prove that he 's Christ , he says his followers are n't asking for proof .
" So you tell the millions of followers I have that … this guy is a liar .
You know what are they going to say ?
Is that I prefer his lies than what religion gave me .
I prefer , see because when they believe in what I teach , they activate angels in their life . "
' Jesus Drank Wine Because He Didn't Have Dewar's '
His followers do seem happy .
They greet him with mariachi bands at airports and often collapse in tears when they see him preach .
But when he speaks to them , it is without theatrics .
No holy rolling , no healing -- it 's a pretty straightforward lesson in the fundamentals of what he believes .
And it's an upbeat , no - fault , sin - free message .
This self - proclaimed Jesus does not believe in sin , hell , the devil or damnation of any kind .
" Before the presence of God , there 's no more sin , " he says .
And with no sin , de Jesus teaches his followers , there 's no devil and no need for prayer , because after Jesus of Nazareth died and was resurrected , one can literally do no wrong in God 's eyes .
De Jesus says things like murder and theft are crimes , but not sins , and that people are punished for these crimes on earth .
" Heaven does n't have anything to do with your behavior , " he says .
And de Jesus practices what he preaches :
He loves women and has been married twice .
He smokes cigarettes and while enjoying a glass of scotch , he says , " Jesus drank wine because he did n't have Dewar's . "
De Jesus does n't mind that his ministry often gathers in the corner tavern .
" Like my former , Jesus of Nazareth , he used to go to places like this and the religious people , they used to criticize him . …
I 'm just doing the same kind of thing . "
But he does draw the line : no drugs , and he says no getting drunk .
" Jesus never got drunk and I never get drunk .
I enjoy life .
I enjoy everything that I do . "
' The Super Raza '
De Jesus has come a long way from Puerto Rico , and those rough times .
Today his believers give money freely .
And where does all the money go ?
Joane de Jesus , the daughter of the man called Jesus , is the official accountant for the ministry .
She says , " What you see as luxuries are gifts that members have given him .
They 're just very grateful , and they want to give him gifts . "
There are no rules in de Jesus ' church .
Anything goes when you follow " Jesus of Suburbia . "
But he is serious about being the Second Coming of Christ .
And along with his followers , he also has many detractors .
Some who think he's the devil incarnate and others who think he 's just a charlatan and a con man .
One of the things that makes him so hated , so controversial , is that he preaches the Catholic Church is evil , and his followers burn pictures of the pope and hold protests outside churches .
And what about the children who grow up in his movement believing that Jesus is alive and well ?
He calls them the " super raza " or the super race , because they are being brought up pure and with no stain of false religion on them .
The de Jesus ministry is growing , with big followings in Venezuela , Columbia , even Cuba , and the man who believes he is the Second Coming of Christ is now turning his attention to America .
" Miami is the bridge for all nations , " he said .
" That 's where Hispanics are , and then eventually I 'm going to find a lot of beautiful English - speaking people who will want to believe in me and I 'm going to have millions of them . "
Associate Producer Caroline Borge contributed to this report .
Abstract
I offer you a new hash function for hash table lookup that is faster and more thorough than the one you are using now .
I also give you a way to verify that it is more thorough .
All the text in this color was n't in the 1997 Dr Dobbs article .
The code given here are all public domain .
The Hash
Over the past two years I 've built a general hash function for hash table lookup .
Most of the two dozen old hashes I 've replaced have had owners who would n't accept a new hash unless it was a plug - in replacement for their old hash , and was demonstrably better than the old hash .
These old hashes defined my requirements :
The keys are unaligned variable - length byte arrays .
Sometimes keys are several such arrays .
Sometimes a set of independent hash functions were required .
Average key lengths ranged from 8 bytes to 200 bytes .
Keys might be character strings , numbers , bit - arrays , or weirder things .
Table sizes could be anything , including powers of 2 .
The hash must be faster than the old one .
The hash must do a good job .
Without further ado , here 's the fastest hash I 've been able to design that meets all the requirements .
The comments describe how to use it .
Update : I 'm leaving the old hash in the text below , but it 's obsolete , I have faster and more thorough hashes now .
http://burtleburtle.net/bob/c/lookup3.c ( 2006 ) is about 2 cycles / byte , works well on 32 - bit platforms , and can produce a 32 or 64 bit hash .
SpookyHash ( 2011 ) is specific to 64 - bit platforms , is about 1/3 cycle per byte , and produces a 32 , 64 , or 128 bit hash .
typedef unsigned long int ub4 ; /* unsigned 4 - byte quantities */ typedef unsigned char ub1 ; /* unsigned 1 - byte quantities */ # define hashsize ( n ) ( ( ub4 ) 1 < <( n ) ) # define hashmask ( n ) ( hashsize (n ) -1 ) /*
-------------------------------------------------------------------- mix -- mix 3 32 - bit values reversibly .
For every delta with one or two bits set , and the deltas of all three high bits or all three low bits , whether the original value of a , b , c is almost all zero or is uniformly distributed , * If mix ( ) is run forward or backward , at least 32 bits in a , b , c have at least 1/ 4 probability of changing .
* If mix ( ) is run forward , every bit of c will change between 1/3 and 2/3 of the time .
( Well , 22/100 and 78/100 for some 2 - bit deltas . ) mix ( ) was built out of 36 single - cycle latency instructions in a structure that could supported 2 x parallelism , like so : a -= b ; a -= c ; x = ( c >>13 ) ; b -= c ; a ^= x ; b -= a ; x = ( a < < 8 ) ; c -= a ; b ^= x ; c -= b ; x = ( b>>13 ) ; ...
Unfortunately , superscalar Pentiums and Sparcs can't take advantage of that parallelism .
They 've also turned some of those single - cycle latency instructions into multi-cycle latency instructions .
Still , this is the fastest good hash I could find .
There were about 2 ^ ^ 68 to choose from .
I only looked at a billion or so .

-------------------------------------------------------------------- hash( ) -- hash a variable - length key into a 32 - bit value k : the key ( the unaligned variable - length array of bytes ) len : the length of the key , counting by bytes initval : can be any 4 - byte value Returns a 32 - bit value .
Every bit of the key affects every bit of the return value .
Every 1 - bit and 2 - bit delta achieves avalanche .
About 6 * len+35 instructions .
The best hash table sizes are powers of 2 .
There is no need to do mod a prime ( mod is sooo slow ! ) .
If you need less than 32 bits , use a bitmask .
For example , if you need only 10 bits , do h = ( h & hashmask ( 10 ) ) ;
In which case , the hash table should have hashsize ( 10 ) elements .
If you are hashing n strings ( ub1 ** ) k , do it like this : for ( i=0 , h=0 ; i< n ; ++i ) h = hash ( k[i ] , len[i ] , h ) ; By Bob Jenkins , 1996 .

Most hashes can be modeled like this :
initialize ( internal state ) for ( each text block ) { combine ( internal state , text block ) ; mix( internal state ) ; } return postprocess ( internal state ) ;
In the new hash , mix ( ) takes 3n of the 6n+35 instructions needed to hash n bytes .
Blocks of text are combined with the internal state ( a , b , c ) by addition .
This combining step is the rest of the hash function , consuming the remaining 3n instructions .
The only postprocessing is to choose c out of ( a , b , c ) to be the result .
Three tricks promote speed :
Mixing is done on three 4 - byte registers rather than on a 1 - byte quantity .
Combining is done on 12 - byte blocks , reducing the loop overhead .
The final switch statement combines a variable - length block with the registers a , b , c without a loop .
The golden ratio really is an arbitrary value .
Its purpose is to avoid mapping all zeros to all zeros .
The Hash Must Do a Good Job
The most interesting requirement was that the hash must be better than its competition .
What does it mean for a hash to be good for hash table lookup ?
A good hash function distributes hash values uniformly .
If you do n't know the keys before choosing the function , the best you can do is map an equal number of possible keys to each hash value .
If keys were distributed uniformly , an excellent hash would be to choose the first few bytes of the key and use that as the hash value .
Unfortunately , real keys are n't uniformly distributed .
Choosing the first few bytes works quite poorly in practice .
The real requirement then is that a good hash function should distribute hash values uniformly for the keys that users actually use .
How do we test that ?
Let 's look at some typical user data .
( Since I work at Oracle , I 'll use Oracle 's standard example : the EMP table . )

Consider each horizontal row to be a key .
Some patterns appear .
Keys often differ in only a few bits .
For example , all the keys are ASCII , so the high bit of every byte is zero .
Keys often consist of substrings arranged in different orders .
For example , the MGR of some keys is the EMPNO of others .
Length matters .
The only difference between zero and no value at all may be the length of the value .
Also , " aa aaa " and " aaa aa " should hash to different values .
Some keys are mostly zero , with only a few bits set .
( That pattern does n't appear in this example , but it 's a common pattern . )
Some patterns are easy to handle .
If the length is included in the data being hashed , then lengths are not a problem .
If the hash does not treat text blocks commutatively , then substrings are not a problem .
Strings that are mostly zeros can be tested by listing all strings with only one bit set and checking if that set of strings produces too many collisions .
The remaining pattern is that keys often differ in only a few bits .
If a hash allows small sets of input bits to cancel each other out , and the user keys differ in only those bits , then all keys will map to the same handful of hash values .
A common weakness
Usually , when a small set of input bits cancel each other out , it is because those input bits affect only a smaller set of bits in the internal state .
Consider this hash function :
for ( hash=0 , i=0 ; i<hash ; ++i ) hash = ( ( hash < < 5 ) ^( hash > > 27 ) ) ^key [ i ] ; return ( hash % prime ) ;
Any time n input bits can only affect m output bits , and n > m , then the 2n keys that differ in those input bits can only produce 2 m distinct hash values .
The same is true if n input bits can only affect m bits of the internal state -- later mixing may make the 2 m results look uniformly distributed , but there will still be only 2 m results .
The function above has many sets of 2 bits that affect only 1 bit of the internal state .
If there are n input bits , there are ( n choose 2 ) = ( n * n /2 - n /2 ) pairs of input bits , only a few of which match weaknesses in the function above .
It is a common pattern for keys to differ in only a few bits .
If those bits match one of a hash 's weaknesses , which is a rare but not negligible event , the hash will do extremely bad .
In most cases , though , it will do just fine .
( This allows a function to slip through sanity checks , like hashing an English dictionary uniformly , while still frequently bombing on user data . )
In hashes built of repeated combine - mix steps , this is what usually causes this weakness :
A small number of bits y of one input block are combined , affecting only y bits of the internal state .
So far so good .
The mixing step causes those y bits of the internal state to affect only z bits of the internal state .
The next combining step overwrites those bits with z more input bits , cancelling out the first y input bits .
The same thing can happen in reverse :
Uncombine this block , causing y block bits to unaffect y bits of the internal state .
Unmix the internal state , leaving x bits unaffected by the y bits from this block .
Unmixing the previous block unaffects those x bits , cancelling out this block 's y bits .
( If the mixing function is not a permutation of the internal state , it is not reversible .
Instead , it loses information about the earlier blocks every time it is applied , so keys differing only in the first few input blocks are more likely to collide .
The mixing function ought to be a permutation . )
It is easy to test whether this weakness exists : if the mixing step causes any bit of the internal state to affect fewer bits of the internal state than there are output bits , the weakness exists .
This test should be run on the reverse of the mixing function as well .
It can also be run with all sets of 2 internal state bits , or all sets of 3 .
Another way this weakness can happen is if any bit in the final input block does not affect every bit of the output .
( The user might choose to use only the unaffected output bit , then that 's 1 input bit that affects 0 output bits . )
A Survey of Hash Functions
We now have a new hash function and some theory for evaluating hash functions .
Let 's see how various hash functions stack up .
Additive Hash
ub4 additive ( char * key , ub4 len , ub4 prime ) { ub4 hash , i ; for ( hash=len , i=0 ; i< len ; ++i ) hash += key [ i ] ; return ( hash % prime ) ; }
hash
Rotating Hash
u b4 rotating ( char * key , ub4 len , ub4 prime ) { ub4 hash , i ; for ( hash=len , i=0 ; i< len ; ++i ) hash = ( hash < < 4 ) ^( hash > > 28 ) ^key [ i ] ; return ( hash % prime ) ; }
On machines with a rotate ( such as the Intel x86 line ) this is 6n+2 instructions .
I have seen the ( hash % prime ) replaced with hash = ( hash ^ ( hash > > 10 ) ^ ( hash > > 20 ) ) & mask ; eliminating the % and allowing the table size to be a power of 2 , making this 6n+6 instructions .
% can be very slow , for example it is 230 times slower than addition on a Sparc 20 .
One - at - a- Time Hash ub4 one_at_a_time ( char * key , ub4 len ) { ub4 hash , i ; for ( hash=0 , i=0 ; i< len ; ++i ) { hash += key [ i ] ; hash += ( hash << 10 ) ; hash ^= ( hash >> 6 ) ; } hash += ( hash << 3 ) ; hash ^= ( hash >> 11 ) ; hash += ( hash << 15 ) ; return ( hash & mask ) ; }
This is similar to the rotating hash , but it actually mixes the internal state .
It takes 9n+9 instructions and produces a full 4 - byte result .
Preliminary analysis suggests there are no funnels .
This hash was not in the original Dr. Dobb 's article .
I implemented it to fill a set of requirements posed by Colin Plumb .
Colin ended up using an even simpler ( and weaker ) hash that was sufficient for his purpose .
Bernstein's hash ub4 bernstein ( ub1 * key , ub4 len , ub4 level ) { ub4 hash = level ; ub4 i ; for ( i=0 ; i< len ; ++i ) hash = 33 * hash + key [ i ] ; return hash ; }
If your keys are lowercase English words , this will fit 6 characters into a 32 - bit hash with no collisions ( you 'd have to compare all 32 bits ) .
If your keys are mixed case English words , 65 * hash + key [ i ] fits 5 characters into a 32 - bit hash with no collisions .
That means this type of hash can produce ( for the right type of keys ) fewer collisions than a hash that gives a more truly random distribution .
If your platform does n't have fast multiplies , no sweat , 33 * hash = hash +( hash < < 5 ) and most compilers will figure that out for you .
On the down side , if you do n't have short text keys , this hash has a easily detectable flaws .
For example , there 's a 3 - into - 2 funnel that 0x0021 and 0x0100 both have the same hash ( hex 0x21 , decimal 33 ) ( you saw that one coming , yes ? ) .
FNV
Hash I need to fill this in .
See it on wikipedia .
It 's faster than lookup3 on Intel ( because Intel has fast multiplication ) , but slower on most other platforms .
Preliminary tests suggested it has decent distributions .
It 's public domain .
I have three complaints against it .
First , it 's specific about how to reduce the size if you do n't use all the bits , it 's not just a mask .
Increasing the result size by one bit gives you a completely different hash .
If you use a hash table that grows by increasing the result size by one bit , one old bucket maps across the entire new table , not to just two new buckets .
If your algorithm has a sliding pointer for which buckets have been split , that just wo n't work with FNV .
Second , it 's linear .
That means that widely separated things can cancel each other out at least as easily as nearby things .
Third , since multiplication only affects higher bits , the lowest 7 bits of the state are never affected by the 8th bit of all the input bytes .
On the plus side , very nearby things never cancel each other out at all .
This makes FNV a good choice for hashing very short keys ( like single English words ) .
FNV is more robust than Bernstein 's hash .
It can handle any byte values , not just ASCII characters . ub4 fnv( ) { /*
I need to fill this in */ } Goulburn Hash The Goulburn hash is like my one - at - a - time , but more thorough and slower for all lengths beyond 0 , asymptotically over 2 x slower .
It has two tables , g_table0 and g_table1 , of respectively 256 and 128 4 - byte integers .
For large hash tables ( which is where being more thorough ought to buy you something ) , it does worse , because its internal operations not reversible .
Specifically h^=rotate ( h,3 ) and h^=rotate ( h, 14 ) , which each cause an even number of bits to be set .
I hashed the 232 32 - bit integers with lookup3 , one - at - a - time , and goulburn , and they produced 2,696,784,567 , and 1,667,635,157 , and 897,563,758 values respectively .
The expected number for a random mapping would be 2,714,937,129 values .
u4 goulburn ( const unsigned char * cp , size_t len , uint32_t last_value ) { register u4 h = last_value ; int u ; for ( u=0 ; u<len ; ++u ) { h += g_table0 [ cp[u ] ] ; h ^= ( h << 3 ) ^ ( h >> 29 ) ; h += g_table1 [ h >> 25 ] ; h ^= ( h << 14 ) ^ ( h >> 18 ) ; h += 1783936964UL
; } return h ; } MurmurHash I need to fill this in too .
This is faster than any of my hash , and is more nonlinear than a rotating hash or FNV .
I can see it 's weaker than my lookup3 , but I do n't by how much , I have n't tested it .
http://murmurhash.googlepages.com/.
Cessu The Cessu hash ( search for msse2 in his blog ) uses SSE2 , allowing it to be faster and more thorough ( at first glance ) than what I can do 32 bits at a time .
I have n't done more than a first glance at it .
Pearson's Hash
char pearson ( char * key , ub4 len , char tab [ 256 ] ) { char hash ; ub4 i ; for ( hash=len , i=0 ; i< len ; ++i ) hash=tab [ hash^key [ i ] ] ; return ( hash ) ; }
tab [ ]
CRC Hashing
u b4 crc( char * key , ub4 len , ub4 mask , ub4 tab [ 256 ] ) { ub4 hash , i ; for ( hash=len , i=0 ; i< len ; ++i ) hash = ( hash >> 8 ) ^ tab [ ( hash & 0xff ) ^ key [ i ] ] ; return ( hash & mask ) ; } This takes 9n+3 instructions .
tab is initialized to simulate a maximal - length Linear Feedback Shift Register ( LFSR ) which shifts out the low - order bit and XORs with a polynomial if that bit was 1 .
I used a 32 - bit state with a polynomial of 0xedb88320 for the tests .
Keys that differ in only four consecutive bytes will not collide .
A sample implementation , complete with table , is here .
You could also implement it like ub4 crc( char * key , ub4 len , ub4 mask , ub4 tab [ 256 ] ) { ub4 hash , i ; for ( hash=len , i=0 ; i< len ; ++i ) hash = ( hash << 8 ) ^ tab [ ( hash >> 24 ) ^ key [ i ] ] ; return ( hash & mask ) ; } but , since shifts are sometimes slow , the other way might be faster .
If you did it that way you 'd have to reverse the bits of the generating polynomial because bits shift out the top instead of the bottom .
Generalized CRC Hashing
This is exactly the same code as CRC hashing except it fills tab [ ] with each of the 4 bytes forming a random permutation of 0..255 .
Unlike a true CRC hash , its mixing is nonlinear .
Keys that differ in only one byte will not collide .
The top byte has to be a permutation of 0..255 so no information is lost when the low byte is shifted out .
The other bytes are permutations of 0..255 only to make hold the guarantee that keys differing in one byte will not collide .
A sample implementation , complete with table , is here .
Universal Hashing
ub4 universal ( char * key , ub4 len , ub4 mask , ub4 tab [ MAXBITS ] ) { ub4 hash , i ; for ( hash=len , i=0 ; i < ( len < < 3 ) ; i+=8 ) { register char k = key [ i>> 3 ] ; if ( k&0x01 ) hash ^= tab [ i+0 ] ; if ( k&0x02 ) hash ^= tab [ i+1 ] ; if ( k&0x04 ) hash ^= tab [ i+2 ] ; if ( k&0x08 ) hash ^= tab [ i+3 ] ; if ( k&0x10 ) hash ^= tab [ i+4 ] ; if ( k&0x20 ) hash ^= tab [ i+5 ] ; if ( k&0x40 ) hash ^= tab [ i+6 ] ; if ( k&0x80 ) hash ^= tab [ i+7 ] ; } return ( hash & mask ) ; }
Zobrist Hashing
u b4 zobrist ( char * key , ub4 len , ub4 mask , ub4 tab [ MAXBYTES ] [ 256 ] ) { ub4 hash , i ; for ( hash=len , i=0 ; i< len ; ++i ) hash ^= tab [ i ] [ key [ i ] ] ; return ( hash & mask ) ; }
Zobrist hashes are especially favored for chess , checkers , othello , and other situations where you have the hash for one state and you want to compute the hash for a closely related state .
You xor to the old hash the table values that you 're removing from the state , then xor the table values that you 're adding .
For chess , for example , that 's 2 xors to get the hash for the next position given the hash of the current position .
Paul Hsieh 's hash
This is kind of a cross between that big hash at the start of this article and my one - at - a - time hash .
Paul 's timed it and it was than that big hash .
It has a 4 - byte internal state that it does light nonlinear mixing after every combine .
That 's good .
It combines 2 - byte blocks with its 4 - byte state , which is something I 'd never tried .
( FNV and CRC and one - at - a - time combine 1 - byte blocks with the 4 - byte state .
Their input blocks are all smaller than their state , and they mix their state after each input block , which makes it impossible for consecutive input blocks to cancel . )
On the down side , it has funnels of 3 bits into 2 , for example hex 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 and 00 00 20 00 01 00 00 00 both hash to 0xc754ae23 .

My Hash
This takes 6n+35 instructions .
It 's the big one at the beginning of the article .
It 's implemented along with a self - test at http://burtleburtle.net/bob/c/lookup2.c. lookup3.c
A hash I wrote nine years later designed along the same lines as " My Hash " , see http://burtleburtle.net/bob/c/lookup3.c.
It takes 2n instructions per byte for mixing instead of 3n .
When fitting bytes into registers ( the other 3n instructions ) , it takes advantage of alignment when it can ( a trick learned from Paul Hsieh 's hash ) .
It does n't bother to reserve a byte for the length .
That allows zero - length strings to require no mixing .
More generally , the length that requires additional mixes is now 13 - 25 - 37 instead of 12-24 - 36 .
One theoretical insight was that the last mix does n't need to do well in reverse ( though it has to affect all output bits ) .
And the middle mixing steps do n't have to affect all output bits ( affecting some 32 bits is enough ) , though it does have to do well in reverse .
So it uses different mixes for those two cases .
" My Hash " ( lookup2.c ) had a single mixing operation that had to satisfy both sets of requirements , which is why it was slower .
On a Pentium 4 with gcc 3.4.? , Paul 's hash was usually faster than lookup3.c .
On a Pentium 4 with gcc 3.2.? , they were about the same speed .
On a Pentium 4 with icc - O2 , lookup3.c was a little faster than Paul 's hash .
I do n't know how it would play out on other chips and other compilers .
lookup3.c is slower than the additive hash pretty much forever , but it 's faster than the rotating hash for keys longer than 5 bytes .
lookup3.c does a much more thorough job of mixing than any of my previous hashes ( lookup2. c , lookup . c , One - at - a - time ) .
All my previous hashes did a more thorough job of mixing than Paul Hsieh 's hash .
Paul 's hash does a good enough job of mixing for most practical purposes .
The most evil set of keys I know of are sets of keys that are all the same length , with all bytes zero , except with a few bits set .
This is tested by frog .c..
To be even more evil , I had my hashes return b and c instead of just c , yielding a 64 - bit hash value .
Both lookup.c and looku p2. c start seeing collisions after 253 frog .c keypairs .
Paul Hsieh 's hash sees collisions after 217 keypairs , even if we take two hashes with different seeds .
lookup3.c is the only one of the batch that passes this test .
It gets its first collision somewhere beyond 263 keypairs , which is exactly what you 'd expect from a completely random mapping to 64 - bit values .
MD4
The table below compares all these hash functions .
NAME is the name of the hash .
SIZE - 1000 is the smallest reasonable hash table size greater than 1000 .
SPEED is the speed of the hash , measured in instructions required to produce a hash value for a table with SIZE - 1000 buckets .
It is assumed the machine has a rotate instruction .
These are n't very accurate measures ... I should really just do timings on a Pentium 4 or such .
INLINE
This is the speed assuming the hash is inlined in a loop that has to walk through all the characters anyways , such as a tokenizer .
Such a loop does n't always exist , and even when it does inlining is n't always possible .
Some hashes ( my new hash and MD4 ) work on blocks larger than a character .
Inlining a hash removes 3n+1 instructions of loop overhead .
It also removes the n instructions needed to get the characters out of the key array and into a register .
It also means the length is n't known .
Inlining offers other advantages .
It allows the string to be converted to uppercase , and / or to unicode , before the hash is performed without the expense of an extra loop or a temporary buffer .
FUNNEL - 15 is the largest set of input bits affecting the smallest set of internal state bits when mapping 15 - byte keys into a 1 - byte result .
FUNNEL - 100 is the largest set of input bits affecting the smallest set of internal state bits when mapping 100 - byte keys into a 32 - bit result .
COLLIDE - 32 is the number of collisions found when a dictionary of 38,470 English words was hashed into a 32 - bit result .
( The expected number of collisions is 0.2 . )
COLLIDE - 1000 is a chi2 measure of how well the hash did at mapping the 38470 - word dictionary into the SIZE - 1000 table .
( A chi2 measure greater than +3 is significantly worse than a random mapping ; less than - 3 is significantly better than a random mapping ; in between is just random fluctuations . )
Comparison of several hash functions
NAME SIZE - 1000 SPEED INLINE FUNNEL -15 FUNNEL - 100 COLLIDE -32 COLLIDE -1000 Additive 1009 5n+3 n+2 15 into 2 100 into 2 37006 +806.02 Rotating 1009 6n+3 2n+2 4 into 1 25 into 1 24 +1.24 One - at - a- Time 1024 9n+9 5n+8 none none 0 - 0.05 Bernstein 1024 7n+3 3n+2 3 into 2 3 into 2 4 +1.69 FNV 1024 ? ? ? ? ? ?
Pearson 1024 12n+5 4n+3 none none 0 +1.65 CRC 1024 9n+3 5n+2 2 into 1 11 into 10 0 +0.07 Generalized 1024 9n+3 5n+2 none none 0 - 1.83 Universal 1024 52n+3 48n+2 4 into 3 50 into 28 0 +0.20 Zobrist 1024 10n+3 6n+2 none none 1 - 0.03 Paul Hsieh 's 1024 5n+17 N/A 3 into 2 3 into 2 1 +1.12 My Hash 1024 6n+35 N/ A none none 0 +0.33 lookup3.c 1024 5n+20 N/ A none none 0 - 0.08 MD4 1024 9.5n +230 N/
A none none 1 +0.73
From the measurements we can conclude that the Additive and Rotating hash ( and maybe Bernstein ) were noticably bad for 32 - bit results , and only the Additive hash was noticably bad for 10 - bit results .
If inlining is possible , the Rotating hash was the fastest acceptable hash , followed by Bernstein , Pearson or the Generalized CRC ( if table lookup is OK ) or Bernstein or One - at - a- Time ( if table lookup is not OK ) .
If inlining is not possible , it 's a draw between lookup3 and Paul Hsieh 's hash .
Note that , for many applications , the Rotating hash is noticably bad and should not be used , and the Bernstein hash is marginal .
Table lengths should always be a power of 2 because that 's faster than prime lengths and all acceptable hashes allow it .
The COLLIDE - 1000 numbers should be ignored , unless the numbers are bigger than 3 or less than - 3 .
For example , generalized CRC produced +.8 , -.8 , or - 1.8 for three different tables I tried .
It 's just noise .
A different set of keys would give unrelated random fluctuations .

DIGG THIS
From CNN / AP : Rove Blasts Warrantless Wiretapping Decision .
TOLEDO , Ohio — Presidential adviser Karl Rove criticized a federal judge ’s order for an immediate end to the government ’s warrantless surveillance program , saying Wednesday such a program might have prevented the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks .
Rove said the government should be free to listen if al Qaeda is calling someone within the U.S.
" Imagine if we could have done that before 9/11 .
It might have been a different outcome , " he said .
It ’s time to be done with the dangerous fiction that this kind of thing is just " hardball politics " — or indeed , politics of any kind , as the term is normally understood in a democracy .
What Rove is giving voice to here is nothing less than the new blood libel of our age : that those who oppose the Bush Administration ’s unconstitutional actions are opening the door to a new 9/11 .
The implication is clear : anyone who speaks up for the Constitution is working for the death of innocent Americans .
They are , by definition , traitors .
Thus they deserve what traitors get : death .
Rove is being only slightly less circumspect than the innumerable Bushist sycophants and bootlickers yapping in the echo chamber of the right - wing media , who say openly that pro-Constitution citizens are actively yearning for another 9/11 ; they want the terrorists " to win ; " they want more Americans to die .
Every day this drumbeat grows louder : traitors are among us , terrorist - lovers are among us , they ’re going to get us killed , we must stop them — at all costs .
Karl
Rove knows full well that the words he spoke in Toledo were a lie .
He know that the government had the power and the Constitutional right " to listen if al Qaeda [ was ] calling someone in the U.S. " before 9/11 , just as it does now , through the very FISA secret court system that Bush ’s warrantless surveillance openly circumvents .
Rove knows that the FISA judges require only the barest hint of possible terrorist connections ( or perhaps none at all , as far as we know ) to authorize such wiretaps , which they had done without a single demur thousands of times before 9/11 .
What ’s more , Rove knows that the government could initiate such wiretaps instantly , without any warrant whatsoever , and keep them running for 72 hours before seeking retroactive approval from the ever - compliant FISA court .
Rove knows there is not a single imaginable circumstance in which the interception of communications involving the alleged 9/11 hijackers would have been blocked by the Congressionally - mandated , Constitutional FISA system in place before the attacks .
There is no imaginable circumstance in which the communications of even remotely suspected terrorists would be blocked by FISA today .
Thus Bush ’s warrantless surveillance program is completely unnecessary for " listening in if al Qaeda is calling someone in the U.S. , " or for the monitoring of any other remotely possible terrorist threat .
From this reality , we can draw only one conclusion : the warrantless surveillance program is being used for something other than monitoring the communications of terrorist suspects and those connected to them .
This is doubly confirmed by the fact that over the past few years , Congress has repeatedly asked the Bush Administration if it needed even stronger surveillance powers than the frankly draconian FISA court already gave them .
No , no , said Bush ’s minions ; what we have is good enough .
Good enough to monitor terrorist threats , yes ; but clearly not sweeping enough for whatever it is the Bush Administration is actually doing with its warrantless surveillance program .
And what are they really doing ?
Karl Rove knows , of course — but we do n’t .
One key aspect of the program is certain , however : whether it ’s being used against terrorist suspects , or political opponents , or competitors of the Bush Faction ’s corporate cronies , the main purpose of the program is to establish the principle that the " unitary executive " cannot be bound by any law .
It is yet another step in the careful , fully conscious construction of a presidential dictatorship , a new kind of state to replace the old Constitutional Republic that Bush and his fellow elitists find so inconvenient to their pursuit of wealth , dominion and ideological fantasy .
So here is where we are .
The president ’s chief adviser is deliberately telling lies about the Administration ’s clearly criminal peeping - tom program , lies deliberately constructed to sow fear among the American people — and murderous hatred for those who oppose presidential dictatorship .
This is n’t politics .
This is n’t partisanship .
This is blood libel , and it will end in blood — sooner , not later .
The Best of Chris Floyd
Although people think they make 15 food decisions a day on average , his research shows the number is well over 200 .
Some are obvious , some are subtle .
The bigger the plate , the larger the spoon , the deeper the bag , the more we eat .
But sometimes we decide how much to eat based on how much the person next to us is eating , sometimes moderating our intake by more than 20 percent up or down to match our dining companion .
Much of his work is outlined in the book “ Mindless Eating : Why We Eat More Than We Think ” ( Bantam ) , which will be published on Tuesday .
The book is his fourth over all , but his first directed at a general audience .
It is peppered with his goofy , appealing Midwestern humor and practical diet tips .
But the most fascinating material is directly from his studies on university campuses and in test kitchens for institutions like the United States Army .
An appalling example of our mindless approach to eating involved an experiment with tubs of five - day - old popcorn .
Moviegoers in a Chicago suburb were given free stale popcorn , some in medium - size buckets , some in large buckets .
What was left in the buckets was weighed at the end of the movie .
The people with larger buckets ate 53 percent more than people with smaller buckets .
And people did n’t eat the popcorn because they liked it , he said .
They were driven by hidden persuaders : the distraction of the movie , the sound of other people eating popcorn and the Pavlovian popcorn trigger that is activated when we step into a movie theater .
Dr. Wansink is particularly proud of his bottomless soup bowl , which he and some undergraduates devised with insulated tubing , plastic dinnerware and a pot of hot tomato soup rigged to keep the bowl about half full .
The idea was to test which would make people stop eating : visual cues , or a feeling of fullness .
People using normal soup bowls ate about nine ounces .
The typical bottomless soup bowl diner ate 15 ounces .
Some of those ate more than a quart , and did n’t stop until the 20 - minute experiment was over .
When asked to estimate how many calories they had consumed , both groups thought they had eaten about the same amount , and 113 fewer calories on average than they actually had .
Last week in his lab seven people were finishing lunch while watching a big - screen TV .
Cartoons on the TV served as a distraction so participants would not be influenced by what and how much those nearby ate .
If we want the world to embrace free software , we have to make it beautiful .
I ’m not talking about inner beauty , not elegance , not ideological purity … pure , unadulterated , raw , visceral , lustful , shallow , skin deep beauty .
We have to make it gorgeous .
We have to make it easy on the eye .
We have to make it take your friend ’s breath away .
That ’s why I ’m thrilled with the work of some of our community artists .
Check out this logo from Who ( ignore the scaling , view it directly ) :
If you are of an artistic bent then I would urge you to get involved with the Ubuntu Art Team , and peruse or join the Ubuntu Art mailing list .
There is also a new site for community - contributed artwork , being developed by Brandon Holtsclaw and I think currently available at art - staging .ubuntu.com though it will move to art.ubuntu.com and get more horsepower shortly .
Of course , “ pretty but unusable ” wo n’t work either .
It needs to be both functional and attractive .
Rather than bling for bling ’s sake , let ’s use artistic effects to make the desktop BETTER , and obviously better .
This is a challenge we ( the free software community ) share with scientists too .
I had a great coincidental chat with a guy from Imperial College , London , recently .
He lectures in a course which teaches scientists and engineers how to communicate with the rest of humanity .
This is close to my heart – I love the bleeding edge , physics , computer science etc , and I ca n’t stop my imagination from turning ideas into exotic works of mental art .
But mental art is n’t something you can convey very easily – it ’s in your head , after all .
If we want people to get excited about science we have to show them what it ’s makes possible .
Imperial College teaches people who love science how to make it fascinating for everyone else too – something NASA could take to heart .
Similarly , I met up with Susan Greenfield from the Royal Institution – not a loony bin for inbred monarchs , but a public forum for the demonstration , discussion and discourse on science that goes back to the days of Humphrey Davy and Michael Faraday .
In those days , science was hot entertainment for the gentrified classes , who would gather of an evening in formal dress to listen to scientists talk about the magical world that was opening up under their microscopes and instruments .
We spoke about a number of things but I thought that their mandate was most similar to that of the Hip2BeSquare project which I fund in South Africa , which brands the idea of being “ smart with your life ” for students and pupils in SA ( think about it – which pays off more in your life , an extra hour of math or an extra hour on the football field … it takes a lot of math before the marginal benefits line up and it ’s time to hit the fields ) .
All of which goes to say that messaging is important – learning how to “ show off your best stuff ” is an essential skill , and I hope the free software community will take that to heart .

A year ago the subject of attention was n't getting much , well , attention .
But that has been gradually changing , due in part to the efforts of Attention Trust.org ( disclosure : I'm on the Attention Trust board , although I write this post as an individual ) , and also due to the growing realization that big players such as Google are benefiting from data that you generate for them .
In a previous post I described how companies such as Netflix benefit from your " attention data " ( that is , information about what you 're paying attention to ) by recommending products based on what you 've already purchased .
That seems pretty obvious , but it may not be so obvious as to why a company like Google would want this information .
In Google 's case , I think they 're facing problems due to clickfraud , splogs and link spam in general .
While Google certainly employs ways to protect page rank from link spam , it 's an uphill battle , and it's got to be something that their advertisers are ( or soon will be ) concerned about .
For this and other reasons , what Google really needs to know is what people are actually paying attention to - not just what they 're searching for , but also what they 're clicking on and reading .
This is where something like their Web Accelerator comes in handy , since it passes your page requests through Google 's servers , giving them a way to find out where attention is being paid .
In general , I do n't believe there 's anything wrong with this as long as there 's no deception about what 's going on ( and Google does make it clear that traffic is passed through them ) .
But I also believe that you need to seriously consider whether you 're being fairly compensated for what you 're giving up .
Does Google 's Web Accelerator benefit you enough to give them your attention data ?
In my case the answer is no , but I 'd be willing to trade my attention data for free wireless access in my home town .
Of course , your answer may vary depending not only on how valuable the compensation is , but also on whether you agree with the way aggregated attention data is being used .
The other thing you need to be concerned about is whether you can get your own attention data back .
This is where most of the current crop of attention gatherers fail the test , since few of them provide any way for you to get the data they 've collected in a way that enables you to use it outside their service .
I 'm not cynical enough to attribute this solely to greed , though - it may be because they do n't personally identify the data they collect , or that they have n't considered giving back this data simply because very few people have asked for it .
If you 'd like to persuade more companies to share this data with you , then I hope you 'll consider joining AttentionTrust.org .
The more people we have on board , the easier it will be to convince attention gatherers to not only give you access to information they 've collected about you , but also to provide fair compensation for it .

When a leader allows himself to break the rules of humanity , it is the duty of every citizen to break the leader ’s rules .
So wrote Franz Jagerstatter .
Chances are that you have n’t heard of him .
If you ’ve seen or heard his name , it more than likely was n’t in a textbook or classroom .
I learned of his courage and integrity in a seemingly unlikely place : the introduction to an anthology of poetry .
That book , Forty Poems on Recent American History , was the very first volume of poetry I purchased for myself .
Poet Robert Bly , in his pre-Iron John days , edited it and recounted Jagerstatter ’s tale in its opening pages .
During my teen years , that slender volume led me to a lifelong love of some of the poets , such as Pablo Neruda and Hart Crane , whose works were included in it .
Their poems have been translated and are read in scores of languages around the world .
On the other hand , I ’ve yet to run into anyone who ’s heard of Franz Jagerstatter .
So I set to learning more about a man who so eloquently articulated the most basic principle of ethical rebellion against governmental tyranny .
He was not an artist , scholar , statesman or even a Ghandian activist who devoted his life to ending violence and injustice .
Nor was he a member of a pacifistic religious group like the Jehovah ’s Witness or Society of Friends .
Rather , he was an Austrian peasant who was the sexton in his local Catholic church .
Like most people of his time , place and social class , he did n’t continue his formal education beyond grammar school .
He lived far removed from the creative energy and political ferment of Vienna , Berlin and Paris .
His contact with that world came but once a week , when he visited the library of a nearby village .
La Bibliotheque Nationale it was n’t .
But it provided him with intellectual and spiritual sustenance that would fortify him when the S.S. officers came calling .
During his seminal pilgrimages to its stacks , he had a ringside seat to the discussions , arguments , discourses and monologues of dialecticians , ethicists , orators and poets of the ages .
He internalized their teachings , along with those he gleaned from the Bible , which he had committed to heart .
When the Nazis took control of Austria , they demanded that all of the men report for military service .
From October of 1940 through April of 1941 , he was in the Army , but was not at the front .
He returned home ; the following year , he was called up again .
But this time Jagerstatter refused , asserting that Hitler ’s regime went against the best of what he ’d read and experienced in life .
He was promptly arrested .
At the local police station , his interrogators realized that he could n’t be intimidated out of his convictions .
So the local magistrates sent in lawyers and professors to " reason " him out of his resistance .
At least one of his interviewers expressed admiration for his erudition and his courage of his convictions .
Finally , the local bishop visited him as he sat in the gallows and told him , in essence , that his conscience was advising him wrongly and that he should obey the authorities .
That way , according to the bishop , at least he would have some chance of survival and living a godly life after the conflict was settled .
But the self - educated farmer was having none of it .
In one of his last letters , he wrote to his wife , " If I must write this with my hands in chains , that ’s better than having my will in chains . "
That declaration , and others he made , indicate an astute perception :
Whether we obey or defy governmental imperatives , we are making a choice .
The responsibility is with ourselves , for God ( at least as Jagerstatter understood Him ) gave us free will .
It also shows — at least to me — that Jagerstatter had an understanding of how nearly all modern Western governments operate : by making deference and obedience to power " voluntary . "
Then , when leaders " break the rules of humanity , " as he put it , they can claim that they have the people ’s support in doing so .
As an example , back in the days of the Vietnam intervention , young men were subject to the military draft .
They could choose whether or not they wanted to register for it ; however , choosing not to register could lead to a prison sentence .
So those who were eligible registered .
Once called up , they took the oath to fulfill their military service .
Government leaders could then claim that these young men swore , out of their own free will , to do whatever they were told to do .
It was n’t their job to decide whether or not the orders they received were just ; their only imperative was to obey those orders .
Of course , this means that in today ’s all - volunteer military , said government leaders take even more liberties with the lives of those who enlisted than in the days of the draft .
Many soldiers now understand that in Iraq , they have been engaging in a military action that is not only unconstitutional ( and illegal by international standards ) but also an offense against humanity .
( How else can we describe an action that kills children and other innocent civilians in a country whose regime had no demonstrable links to the events of 9/11 ? )
Some have voiced their opposition .
In essence , they ’re told that because they signed up , they ’re bound to do what they ’re told , and that they should put their own ethical judgments aside .
That is exactly what Franz Jagerstatter refused to do .
He would not allow himself to be inducted .
For that , he was beheaded on 9 August 1943 .
The tragedy is that he acted alone , and his heroism is seen only in hindsight .
However , we now have a critical mass of people who disapprove of what the President is doing with regards to Iraq .
More than a few of us see the immorality , not to mention the illegality , of the invasion .
( Paul Craig Roberts and other columnists on this site have described , in detail , exactly what is wrong with it . )
Many of us are even more troubled by the ways in which the government is curtailing our freedoms , ostensibly to aid in the so - called War on Terrorism .
We are being told to comply when the government demands more and more detailed information about ourselves and each other or to allow ourselves to be strip - searched in airports .
The good news , I believe , is that we can still say " no . "
To paraphrase a favorite writer of mine , nobody can oppress us without our consent .
If that is n’t a lesson of Franz Jaggerstater ’s life and death , I do n’t know what is .

I challenge the National Center for Missing Kids to make O'Reilly apologize to Shawn before he speaks at an event for them being held in Naples , Fl . I 've called their branch and I 'm waiting for a comment , but I doubt they even know about O'Reilly 's behavior .
Olbermann also talked about this ..... I was looking for an apology on O'Reilly 's part , but the NCMEC took it upon themselves to cancel him from appearing :

Which is precisely why he 's leaving .
Poor Rupert has been trying to spend more time with the rest of the .NET team doing cool stuff , but he keeps getting dragged off to fix the old SCLABE * system .
Any time a tweak is required , Rupert 's manager gets Rupert to do it , because he 's been here the longest , knows it the most , and can fix it the quickest .
And he knows exactly why an extra column is added on alternate weekends - a previous customer was having problems with their invoicing , so this was introduced to get round it .
But now Rupert 's off , all his manager can think to do is get him to document what he knows about SCLABE .
The thing is , Rupert 's motivation percentage is equal to the number of days left at the company ; today there are 17 days left , so he is 17 % motivated .
So Rupert adds a table of contents to the document , changes the headers and footers , tweaks " Heading 2 " so it has 6pt spacing before and 12pt afterwards .
He writes about the objectives of the system , describes the main areas of the system as an overview , and spends the rest of the day trying to get Visio to draw something resembling a diagram of the system .
In other words , he 's wasting everyone 's time .
To be fair , he 's asked what he needs to write , and the answer was " enough for someone else to take over from you " .
Well , to take over , they need to know what the thing does , right ?
But that does n't really help the next guy ( who had better not be me ) when the next tweak is required .
There is n't any documentation that will help .
There can't possibly be .
Why ?
Because it is n't Rupert 's knowledge that needs to be passed on , it 's his experience .
And that can't be passed on in a document .
I can read a document telling me how to do a backside footplant wallride , but that does n't mean I understand it , let alone have any success with it .
So what to do ?
For Rupert 's boss , not a lot , except learn for next time .
Rupert 's experience needs to be passed on , which can only be achieved by showing someone .
Although I 've never been a manager , if I was stuck managing SCLABE , I would find a volunteer or two ( willing or otherwise ) to learn from Rupert .
When a tweak is required , the volunteer , let 's call her Ingrid , would sit at the keyboard , with Rupert next to her .
Rupert would tell her how to navigate through the code , what to look for , how to implement the change , how to test it , where to deploy it to , and everything else , without actually doing it himself .
Rupert would answer questions , and sometimes withhold information to make sure Ingrid thought about what she was doing .
She would either work it out , or have to ask the right questions .
In this way , Ingrid would actually experience the system , and start to understand it .
After a few of these sessions , she may be able to fix some things by herself .
This would free up Rupert to get on with the cool AJAX stuff .
If Rupert spent time with others in the team , then it would seem fair , and people could take turns .
If Rupert left , then SCLABE fixes would n't be a major trauma , as someone else could do it .
Rupert would be less likely to leave anyway , as he's now a confident , successful mentor , and even has time to write some Ruby on skis .
* SCLABE is a fictional legacy system written in COBOL on an AS / 400 .
Rupert is a fictional developer , whose resemblance to anyone you know is the whole point of this exercise .
A clarion call to de-silo and take the offensive

The historical development of spam fighting is allowing computer - aware criminals to take the upper hand in the fight against what has now evolved into a completely technologically and organizationally merged threat to public safety .
If we do not change our strategic approach immediately , the battle , indeed even the war may be all but lost .
How we got here
In 1995 the anti-spam community coalesced as spam became more prevalent .
Over the years it evolved from a grass roots effort to make the shift to several mostly - independent streams of attack : the professionals : Anti-spam technical services , lawyers , governments and NGOs , industry coalitions such as Messaging Anti-Abuse Working Group ( MAAWG ) , the Anti-Phishing Working Group ( APWG ) The Anti-Spyware Coalition ( ASC ) , and the volunteer ' amateurs ' such as The SPAMHAUS Project and CAUCE ( the Coalition Against Unsolicited Commercial Email ) who continue to contribute immensely valuable services to the goal of mitigating spam .
Additionally , the independent streams of anti-virus technologists and companies , and those focused on spyware have developed and flourished .
Spam , too has gone from amateur to professional in nature ; when initially sent by individuals from their own email accounts , direct to unwilling recipients , blocking junk email was fairly easy .
By filtering on a specific sender name or email account , receiving sites could refuse mail .
Formative public blacklists had lists of sender addresses and sites known to be a source of spam .
I helped write and maintain one of the very first of these for Concordia University in Montreal , Canada .
Deceptive techniques immediately arose to circumvent these blocks , by forging sending addresses , and then by making use of machines , which would freely transfer mail from anybody to anybody - so - called ' open relays ' .
A campaign to shut down open relays evolved into additional blacklists .
Blacklists and spam - blocking programs had already evolved to cover content as well , and so too the spammers adjusted , by obfuscating words they knew to be blocked , including paragraphs of randomly generated nonsense text to create a series of unique messages .
The foundation was laid for the era of ' false positives ' , legitimate email flagged as spam .
Starting in mid-2001 the spammers evolved again , with the creation , distribution and use of virus programs which would install a mailer or ' open proxy ' on infected machines , allowing them to send mail via desktop computers , unbeknownst to the owner of the machine .
Again , blacklists adjusted , by listing IP addresses from which mail might never legitimately come ( often times best - guess estimates of dynamic address ranges at ISPs , companies and institutions ) .
The arms race between spammers ' and anti-spamming technologies was full on .
This era also marked the first collaborative efforts between spammer and virus makers .
The latter were to this point mostly mischievous hackers doing fairly benign and easily detectable infection runs , and affecting a handful of high - profile attacks on online sites , government system probes and the like .
Viruses tended to operate by planting an enticingly ( deceptively ) - named program on a website , and infecting the rubes who downloaded and ran it .
Self - replication began to be seen more frequently around this time - viruses would begin to mail themselves using resident address books of infected computers .
Plainly , putting the ability to infect massive numbers of computers by way of spam into the hands of virus makers , and the ability to send mail from millions of infected computers into the hands of the spammers was a natural synergistic relationship .
A marriage born in hell , some would say .
The blended criminal threat : where we are today
Penny stocks are chump change :
Of late , much has been said in the popular and computer press about a vector that is annoying , but hardly critical in nature : ' Image spam ' .
Spammers have jumped on the new technology of ' image - only ' payloads , which morph one pixel per message , rendering them unique , and traditional check - sum blocking strategies ineffective .
Image spam is entirely useless for payloads requiring a user to click through to a payload website , because the URLs underlying these clicks can only morph slowly , and the high degree of effectiveness of blacklists such as SURBL remain the best line of defense to deal with that .
In practice what this means is that so - called ' image spam ' tends to be touting penny stocks that the spammers pump and dump , with mention in the graphic of the stock symbol .
Fortunately this fraudulent stock - touting scheme leaves a paper trail that has allowed for some successful prosecutions in the latter half of the year .
Stock spamming , while popular at present time is likely to decline as legal actions increase .
Phishers now trawl netting :
Far more serious , phishing is the vastly popular newish - kid on the block :
Netcraft saw 41,000 different phishing and malware URLs submitted in 2005 .
In 2006 that number soared to 609,000 , going from a maximum of 20,000 reported per month to 45,000 in October , 135,000 in November , and 277,000 in December .
Sophistication in phishing techniques grew as well
Symantec now see 900 unique phishing URLs daily
Phishtank saw over 21,000 discrete submissions in December 2006
The Anti-Phishing Working Group saw a six - fold increase to 38,000 phish in October 2006 from the year previous .
In terms of efficiency of sheer revenue generation , it makes sense for the spammers to have embraced phishing .
After all , why inundate users with advertisements for entirely useless body - part enhancement or reduction potations with hopes that a tiny percentage of the recipients will actually make a purchase , when you can trick end - users into revealing personal information allowing you to reach into their bank account and clean it out ?
Personal Information is the currency used between criminals on the net .
An entire life 's aggregation of data ( name , address , phone numbers , credit cards , social insurance number , driver 's license , and so on ) generally brings the depressingly low prices ( so - called CC Full - A credit card number with billing address sells for $ 2 - $ 5 ) , and a shockingly high price tag to the person whose ID is sold ( 2006 saw the proliferation of Personal ID Insurance and credit bureau reporting services .
Reports of the ineffectiveness of these approaches to ID theft mitigation surfaced towards the end of the year ) .
Of course , this does take one a few steps up the criminal food - chain , from ' high volume email deployment ' service provider to spammer school operator like one certain court - rendered judgment - neutered ' former ' spammer , to conman , to bank robber .
Chicken Little comes home to roost
The effects of all these disparate but related and coordinated threats are definitely being felt .
End - user confidence in e-commerce is already taking a massive hit .
Michael Binder , Assistant Deputy to the Canadian Minister of Industry gave a remarkable presentation making specific note of the precipitous drop in consumer confidence at the Anti-Spyware Coalition meeting in Ottawa in May , 2006
What is marked about the drop in confidence noted by Binder is that it all predates the current levels of phishing and online fraud .
The latest studies show that as many as 90 % of consumers polled expressed deep skepticism in their ability to conduct business safely online , yet paradoxically the rate of growth of online commerce continues apace .
It is safe to say that the growth has been attenuated to a degree , and as consumers increasingly know victims personally , they will back away from online purchases and return to traditional retail outlets .
A cataclysmic failure of a major online financial service could hasten this process .
For example , DNS poisoning of an ISP 's servers to divert users to fraudulent banking sites would need no overt prompting from a phish email , and the number of victims would be far higher than from a phish mail run .
That would make for massive and quite possibly irrecoverable damage to the reputation of not only the firm affected , but all online financial service providers .
To date , banks have been making goodwill compensatory gestures to cover consumer loses due to phishing .
It remains to be seen if that will happen when the losses add up to a significant amount ; legally most financial institutions are not obliged to do so under the terms of typical client service agreements .
However , shaken consumer confidence in online commerce is only a canary in the coalmine .
There is no greater calamity than to under - estimate the strength of your enemy - Lao Tzu
From a technical viewpoint , spam and spammers have quickly evolved from porn and penis - pills to phishing , and the use of viruses , worms , Trojans , and spyware to deliver more of the same .
Spam infects computers , which then become part of botnets , which are used to disseminate more spam , spyware , and viruses .
And round and round it goes ...
There is clear indication that organizationally the walls between the virus - makers , hackers , spyware creators and botnet herders controlling vast networks of zombie'd home and business desktop computers numbering in the hundreds of millions have long been broken down .
There is now full integration with the bad - guy technologists and sophisticated groups of computer - aware criminals bearing absolutely no conceivable relation to the too - often touted cliché of a ' teenager in his parent 's basement hacking into government computers ' the press frustratingly loves to put forth as the cause of present - day computer problems .
That may have been the case in the 1980s and 90s , but no longer .
This stereotype has to be a source of much mirth for those behind the blended threat , as they are often associates or members of traditional organized crime gangs .
As big money began to be made with spam , it attracted the usual suspects .
All the big players are involved now , the Russian Mob , Italian Mafia , Hell 's Angels , and of course Colombian drug - dealing cartels .
There have been some mentions in the press of late that organized crime in eastern Europe is now paying the way for promising young programmers to attend computer science programs in American universities .
The under - written graduates are then set to work doing the bidding of those to whom they are beholden .
It is quite true , indeed this has been happening for years .
What the future holds
The latest spam / malware threat that has a name , SpamThru , has only been used to a tiny percentage of its capacity , and questions arise whether spam is indeed the end game , or rather merely a way to test the implementation of a monstrous creation which will be put to other use as time goes on .
SpamThru has driven the spam volumes through the proverbial roof , some sites noting an 80 % increase in the last 3 months alone .
Forensic analysis of this mechanism shows that it attaches itself to a so - called ' stud ' , a small and difficult - to - detect mechanism previously distributed .
When a removal program is run against SpamThru , it kills the active malware , but leaves the stud able to download SpamThru II or any other new malware the criminals tell it to .
Highly placed technologists feel that SpamThru - infected machines are being used at 20 % of their capacity .
Other technologies currently in common use are polymorphic ' Queen bots ' , which change profile and do various things at different points in time to control subservient zombies computers , and ' fast - flux dns ' which is a DNS server hosted on an infected machine which resolves human - recognizable URLs , for example , http://phishingvictim.ca to a multitude of similarly infected machines .
If an anti-spam researcher files a complaint for take - down of http://phishingvictim.ca residing on IP address 1.2.3.4 there maybe dozens more sites also ( unknowingly ) hosting the site - 2.3.4.5 , 3.4.5.6 , and so on
Several things come into play here .
Anti-spam technologies have become quite effective at blocking spam at the inbox level , though there is a cost in resources to ensure the machines and staff to maintain them do not become overwhelmed , and the spam is blocked at the periphery of a given network .
Data point : AOL reported that they blocked half a trillion spam emails at the entrances to their network in 2005 .
Data point : Ironport noted spam volumes doubled from the year previous , seeing an estimated average of 63 billion sent daily in October , 2006 .
In November they measures two daily mega - spikes hitting 85 billion .
Data point : Major receiving sites ( corporate , ISP and freemail ) have said privately that their systems are all but overwhelmed by the new levels of spam .
Medium , Small and regional ISPs , which traditionally have thin financial margins are beginning to incur disproportionately difficult expenses as they hire new staff , increase their hardware budgets and pay for additional out - sourced anti-spam products and services .
Ironically , the spammers might have inadvertently invented a 100 % effective solution to spam , as they devastate and overwhelm systems , networks , one - another , and more .
Dead systems tell no SMTP .
Spam can easily expand and increase in a number of ways :
More messages ( increased message count )
Larger messages ( on a per- message basis )
More senders ( in rotation over the course of a day )
More concurrent parallel senders
More targeted sending ( e.g. , instead of sending a little to everyone , sending twice as much to half the number of targets )
How much worse can it get ?
( it 's not merely about the email )
" The Internet is down ! " :
Although not inevitable , the complete obliteration of the continued , secure operation of electronic communication , e-commerce other legitimate end services looms close enough for the utmost degree of concern .
It is now well the within the capacity of botnet operators ( " herders " ) to attack any site , network , even an entire country and severely degrade operations , even to the extend of driving them off - line .
If the current trends continue apace , the ability to use the email and even the Internet itself may indeed be ' not at all ' .
Virtual attacks on the real world : Botnets can be used for many things , and have been :
An attack that interfered with the computerized functions of intensive care facilities at a Seattle , Washington hospital saw the sociopath behind that insane action face swift and severe justice earlier this year .
The botnet related to this attack was being used to install adware in an attempt to generate revenues for the criminal .
In 2002 , a 9 - 1 - 1 emergency system in the American state of Washington was disabled with a botnet .
Major airlines , banks , large parts of the U.S. military , railways and nuclear plants infected ( a depressingly - dated article from three and a half years ago lays out many of the scenarios which have now come to pass with nothing being done to mitigate the potential for real - world , bricks and mortar disaster ) .
How long until Al Queda makes good on their threat to launch a computer attack the American financial system ?
The United States ' Department of Homeland Security deemed it a credible enough threat to issue a public statement dismissing it as incredible , and assuring the public ' everything was fine , nothing to look at , go back to your homes ' .
Was this burp in the credit card processing and money transfer system part of the attack ?
The good guys : Moving from Keystone Cops to U.S. Navy SEALs
It became painfully evident during the many conferences I attended this fall1 that presenters and attendees universally agree we are losing the war , and to my mind the losses are mostly due to the good guys being disjointed and disorganized ; the criminals take full advantage of this fact .
There is an immeasurable amount of hard work by some of the smartest , most creative talented people on the planet undertaken to fight on - line attacks .
But it is uncoordinated .
The criminals do n't have to be politic or polite nor do they have to respect co-workers feelings , or intra-governmental diplomatic considerations , or the institutional ego manifest in marketing and public relations considerations ; they operate on a plane well beyond the constraints we deal with daily .
Major companies and governments send entirely different teams to various industry functions ( spam , virus , spyware , network security ) , from entirely separate departments or divisions that rarely , if ever , provide proper reporting let - alone in - depth briefing to one - another .
As well , limited resources , and other factors leads to sending staff who are ill - suited to participate and properly contribute to specific industry coalitions .
Sometimes decisions are driven by concerns concentrated on public image rather than on effective participation ; top - management unawareness of the opportunities being missed may well end up in a catastrophe .
An alphabet soup of industry groups all fighting a unified enemy pell - mell is an entirely inefficient way to deal with a problem more urgent than ever ; off the top of my head , OECD , LAP , CSNA , MAAWG , APWG , ICANN , IETF , IRTF , ITU , ASC , APECTEL , CERTs , ESPC , DMA , CMA , SANS , and countless other marketing , anti-spam , virus , spyware and security organizations meet , discuss , and plan independently .
Participation by all stakeholders : technical , legal and government relations representatives , marketing , and mid- and executive - level administration staff members is critical to success .
As well all sectors - government ( policy and law enforcement ) , educational , infrastructure operators ( DNS , domain and connectivity providers ) , financial institutions , and numerous associated areas must not only be consulted but solicited to actively participate in coordinated efforts towards a solution .
Happily , there is newly founded current trend to send a representative or two intra-group , or hold joint meetings .
Sadly , that falls well short of what we need .
Take back the net
The fight against computer - aware criminals is now at a critical juncture demanding we de-silo the false barriers between types of threats and the people who deal with them , because the nature , power and scope of the blended attack ( spyware , spam , viruses , phish and bots ) that currently exists is actively threatening the very foundational infrastructure and continued viability of the entire Internet .
We , like our opponents have done , must break down the walls between industry groups and stakeholders and take a coordinated approach , beyond that , the approach has to be entirely proactive , not meekly reactive as it has been in the past :
We must work towards the active prosecution of computer - aware criminals and aggressive mitigation of their on - line activities in all manners at the disposal of the keepers of the net .
Initially what is needed is the organization of a series of meta conferences presenting legal , international cooperation , and technological tracks attended by rain - makers and decision - makers , and highly - informed experts from the trenches to help those people operating at more ethereal levels to hear what is happening , and give these latter their marching orders .
This is likely going to have to take place under the auspices of the United Nations or another organization of similar scope .
At such an event there be frank , open discussions about the scope of the problem as it exists , and the somewhat unpalatable steps we need to consider to deal with the problem at hand .
Such an approach will require other organizations to scale back on the frequency of their meetings at least for a short while , to allow their invaluable member participants , already over - taxed by the cost , time and energy expenditure of numerous business trips to countless other conferences to devote time and energy to a united front .
The ineffective reactive stance traditionally taken has been ' things are this bad , we need to do something ' .
Targeted goals need be set , monitored and administered .
Governments ( and private industry ) must allocate staff and financial resources to attain these goals .
Governments in particular cannot push more responsibilities onto over - worked , under - trained policy , investigative and prosecutorial staff with no legislative tools at hand .
They must address and resolve their shortcomings , or bear the responsibility for their inaction .
It is my fervent hope is that the blended threat is dealt with in the manner suggested above , and well in advance of what indeed faces us ; to avoid reactionary changes likely to be taken after a disastrous Titanic moment .
The Titanic , you see , was the catalyst for the imposition of regulation in the radio industry in North America .
Until the inability to find open radio trasnmission frequencies hindered rescue operations radio was as free form and anarchistic as the Internet .
We have seen what pap radio has become , I would bemoan such a fate befalling the Internet in that the free and open network is the creative grist for the mill we all enjoy so much .
The author wishes to effusively thank DJSS , who wishes to remain low - key but whose invaluable input to , and review of the above scrawling was top - notch , and John Levine 's eagle eye helped to smooth out some rough grammatical and syntactical patches .

Angry lawmakers on Friday threatened to amend the USA Patriot Act and limit the FBI ’s powers in the wake of a disclosure that agents had improperly obtained confidential records of people in the United States .
A scathing report issued Friday by the inspector general of the Justice Department found widespread problems in how the FBI has used a form of administrative subpoena -- known as a national security letter -- to gather phone , bank and credit information on thousands of citizens without court oversight .
The problems included the issuing of letters that circumvented Justice Department rules and regulations ; in addition , the report found a record - keeping system in such disarray that annual reports to Congress substantially understated the number of subpoenas the FBI was issuing .
The inspector general also disclosed that the bureau had an unusual contract with three phone companies to provide call records and subscriber information without legal process .

The revelation was a major embarrassment for the FBI , which had vowed to use its investigative powers carefully when Congress reauthorized the Patriot Act last year .
National security letters do not require the approval of a judge , and have long been popular with law enforcement .
The 2001 Patriot Act made them even easier to get in terrorism and espionage cases .
The act also for the first time permitted FBI agents in the field to issue the letters ; that authority had previously been reserved for officials at FBI headquarters .
FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III on Friday took responsibility for failing to establish an adequate monitoring system for the anti-terrorism measure .
“ How could this happen , who is accountable ?
And the answer to that is I am to be held accountable , ” Mueller said in a briefing with reporters .
He cited problems with training and oversight of personnel , as well as the bureau audit system , and announced a number of steps to overhaul the process .
Mueller ’s boss , Atty .
Gen. Alberto R. Gonzales , pointedly criticized the FBI and its director for falling down on the job .

“ During the discussion of the reauthorization of the Patriot Act , I believed that the FBI was acting responsibly in using national security letters , ” Gonzales told a conference of privacy experts Friday .
“ Because of the good work of the IG , I ’ve come to learn that I was wrong . ”
Gonzales said the Justice Department ’s Office of Professional Responsibility had opened an investigation into possible misconduct by lawyers at the FBI who failed to monitor the subpoenas .
“ Once we get that information , we ’ll be in a better position to assess what kinds of steps should be taken , ” Gonzales said after his speech .
“ There is no excuse for the mistakes that have been made , and we are going to make things right as quickly as possible . ”
Two influential senators Friday expressed anger at the inspector general ’s disclosures and said they were considering tightening the Patriot Act regulations that allow the FBI to use the national security letters with such wide latitude .

Sens. Patrick J. Leahy ( D - Vt. ) and Arlen Specter ( R - Pa. ) also said they would call Mueller and Gonzales to testify in the coming weeks to get more answers and determine how widespread the problem is .
Leahy is chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee , which has oversight of the Justice Department and the FBI , and Specter is its ranking Republican and former chairman .
“ The inspector general ’s report shows a massive misuse by the FBI of the national security letters for law enforcement , ” Specter said .
“ There ’ll be oversight hearings .
And I think we may have to go further than that and change the law , to revise the Patriot Act ... and perhaps take away some of the authority which we ’ve already given to the FBI , since they appear not to be able to know how to use it . ”
The report by Inspector Gen. Glenn A. Fine presented a picture of mismanagement and self - regulation gone awry .
Fine said he had no evidence of intentional wrongdoing , but found numerous examples of FBI personnel violating internal guidelines and procedures , as well as a failure to establish clear policies .
The report found that the FBI had greatly underreported the number of problems with national security letters to the President ’s Intelligence Oversight Board .
And it indicated that the violations the FBI did report were less serious than ones that Fine and his investigators uncovered independently .

The FBI reported just 26 possible violations to the White House oversight board between 2003 and 2005 , most of which were minor , such as “ typographical errors , ” the report found .
But the watchdog report indicated that hundreds , or even thousands , of potentially more serious violations went unreported .
Fine said a review of 77 FBI case files in four field offices found that 17 of the files , or 22 % , contained violations that had not been identified by the field office or reported to FBI headquarters as required .
Among the violations of policies and procedures :
* A letter for telephone billing records was issued 22 days after the authorized period for the investigation had lapsed .
* Full consumer credit reports were obtained during espionage investigations , even though the law says the information should only be available in international terrorism cases .

* Educational records were improperly obtained from a North Carolina university .
* Unauthorized information about phone numbers was received in 10 cases because of transcription errors and other problems by phone company providers .
Investigators also alleged that FBI headquarters circumvented the rules by obtaining billing records and subscriber information from three telephone companies on about 3,000 phone numbers without issuing national security letters at all .
The law allows the FBI to obtain such records under “ exigent ” circumstances .
But the report found that the bureau , with the support of the phone companies , was using the power in non-emergency situations .
The records were supplied between 2003 and 2005 .
The report found even top FBI lawyers were unaware of the practice until the latter part of 2004 .

The report did not name the phone companies that received letters or cooperated with authorities by divulging call information .
Sources said those companies probably were among the major long - distance carriers at the time -- AT&T ; Corp. , MCI Inc. , Sprint Corp. or Qwest Communications International Inc .
“ Generally , every day , Verizon units respond to emergency requests from federal , state and local authorities for calling records , ” said Peter Thonis , spokesman for Verizon Communications Inc .
He would not comment , however , on whether the company or MCI -- which it acquired early last year -- was involved in the FBI effort .
AT&T ; spokesman Walt Sharp referred questions to the FBI .
Sprint , now called Sprint Nextel Corp. , would not disclose whether it received one of the letters .
“ Generally , Sprint does n’t comment in situations where there is an ongoing investigation , ” spokeswoman Kathleen Dunleavy said .

Qwest , which has turned down other wide - ranging government requests for information in national security cases , also declined to comment .
The inspector general ’s report found that the number of national security letter requests grew from 8,800 in 2000 to a peak of 56,000 in 2004 .
The total issued in the three - year period covered by Fine ’s review was 143,074 .
“ The authority got decentralized , and what appears to have happened is that the FBI never built the proper processes for accountability and review at the field level , ” said Michael Woods , a former head of the FBI national - security law branch who once reviewed national security letter requests .
“ When all the requests went through my office , we had a really good idea about the legal standards , but it was slow , ” Woods said .
“ People were screaming about the delays . ”

The inspector general ’s report resulted from a concession made to Democrats and other critics of the Patriot Act during the debate over renewing the law last year .
The Bush administration had fought new restrictions on the use of national security letters but acceded to the inspector general conducting periodic reviews for the public .

Back story
How national security letters are supposed to work :
Advertisement
In 1986 , Congress first authorized the FBI to obtain electronic records without approval from a judge .
Called national security letters , these demands could be used to acquire e-mails , telephone and travel records , and financial information -- including credit and bank transactions .
The letters could be sent to telephone and Internet access companies , universities , public interest organizations and nearly all libraries , plus financial and credit companies .
Originally , the FBI could obtain records only for people suspected of being agents of a foreign power .
In 1993 , that was expanded to cover records of anyone suspected of communicating with foreign agents about terrorism or espionage .
The Patriot Act in 2001 eliminated any requirement that the records belong to someone under suspicion .
Now any person ’s records can be obtained if FBI field agents consider him relevant to a terrorism or spying investigation .

The OneCare software has failed two independent tests
OneCare was the only failure among 17 anti-virus programs tested by the AV Comparatives organisation .
Microsoft 's software only spotted 82.4 % of the 500,000 viruses that the independent group subjected it to .
The test is the second in less than a month that Microsoft 's anti-virus software has failed .
Minimum standard
Live OneCare is Microsoft 's flagship security program that , like many other anti-virus products , is designed to help PC users keep their machine clear of malicious software .
Austria - based AV Comparatives carries out quarterly tests of top anti-virus programs to find out if they have kept up with the growing mass of viruses circulating online .
The tests see if anti-virus software can spot a variety of malicious programs including macro and script viruses , worms , backdoors and trojans .
The majority of programs tested , 14 , got an advanced pass or better from AV Comparatives ; two got a standard rating and OneCare failed .
OneCare fared particularly badly against so - called polymorphic viruses which regularly change their configuration in a bid to fool security software .
" Microsoft OneCare performed very low in the test , and did not reach the minimum requirements for participation , " wrote Andreas Clementi , senior tester at AV Comparatives , in the report about the tests .
A Microsoft spokesman said : " We are looking closely at the methodology and results of the test to ensure that Windows Live OneCare performs better in future tests . "
He added that Microsoft was trying to : " determine whether any learnings from these tests can be used to improve our services as part of our ongoing work to continually enhance Windows Live OneCare to ensure the highest level of protection and service that we can provide our customers . "
The spokesman also pointed out that Windows OneCare had been certified by ICSA Labs and the West Point Checkpoint system .
In early February , security magazine Virus Bulletin revealed that OneCare failed to spot all the viruses it tested the software against .

( If you have n’t read it already , please see Part 1 of this series first . )
In Part 1 we started with a concrete and simple example by going over a few basic modifications to my waffles recipe Today , we will go from the specific to the general .
Allow me to share with you my six rules for effective recipe modifications : I rarely find it helpful to start changing up a recipe before I ’ve even made it for the first time .
You can't really change something for the better until you know where you 're starting from .
Otherwise , if the recipe 's perfect as is , you 'll never know , will you ?
Also , keep in mind that you 'll get a lot of fundamentally useful information by making the recipe " by the book " first .
What was hard or easy about the recipe ?
Were there any extraneous steps you might be able to remove ?
What ingredients were truly important or unimportant to the final product ?
Unless you 're clairvoyant , you wo n't be able to answer these questions without following the recipe verbatim at least once .
Of course if you ARE clairvoyant , you already know what I 'm going to say for the rest of this post , so you do n't need to read any further .
Keep in mind that some recipes just do n't tolerate modifications very well , and some recipe ingredients simply .
You 'll find this to be especially true with baked goods , batters , cakes and breads , where you ’ve got to hold the relationship between liquid and dry ingredients relatively constant -- and you most certainly can't mess around with the leavening agents ( baking powder , yeast , baking soda , etc ) .
You can really screw up the chemistry if you ’re not careful with this .
Recall in Part 1 , where I suggest adding oats to the waffles recipe ?
I also told you to add an additional 1/8 to 1/4 cup of milk along with the oats , although I never told you why .
Well , here 's why : this keeps the ratio of liquid to dry ingredients roughly constant .
Note that this is an inexact science , and in the waffles recipe the ratio of oats ( 1/3 of a cup ) and milk ( 1/8 to 1/4 cup ) is not one to one .
This is the type of thing you 'll get a feel for as you experiment with modifications on your own .
Notice how this ties in to my rule to make the recipeYou need to have a feel for what the basic batter looks like before you can experiment with it !
And do n’t get too rattled here with all of these restrictions I ’m throwing at you on baked goods .
Baked goods just do n't tolerate modifications all that well .
Most other dishes , like soups , sauces or casseroles , allow for much more experimentation and flexibility .
This is a mental approach I want you to take after you ’ve made the recipe for the first time .
When you and your family sit down to sample a new recipe , just take a little bit of extra time while you ’re eating to think about the taste .
What do you like and do n’t like about it ?
What additional spices or seasonings could go well with it ?
Again , let 's return to the waffles recipe .
When I thought about potential modifications , it seemed like cinnamon might go along well with the real maple syrup .
Also oats seemed like they might be a neat addition to mix up the texture .
Hmmm , then maybe cinnamon AND oats , who knows ?
You get the picture .
This is how I encourage you to think to let your mind embrace new ideas .
Perhaps you can even get your family into the same mode too -- this is one way to create some quality family time around the dinner table -- and who knows , maybe one of your kids will grow up to be the next Wolfgang Puck !
Of course this assumes that everybody keeps an open and constructive mindset .
Hearing your family say things like , “ Dad , this recipe sucks ! ” is NOT particularly helpful ... Note that with our waffles recipe , there are no unnecessary ingredients at all .
But in some dishes there will be items that you can easily leave out while sacrificing nothing in taste or quality .
We 'll see an example of this in Part 3 when we walk through " before " and " after " versions of my granola recipe
Of course an even better example of this is a recipe with a gross ingredient that you hate and you 're dying to leave out .
For example , I can tolerate raisins in my granola , but I ca n’t stand soggy raisins in any baked goods .
Nothing grosses me out more than biting into a cinnamon roll or a muffin and finding a smushy raisin in there .
So , that ’s a no - brainer for me : I ’ll just leave ‘ em out .
It ’s important to know what kinds of ingredients can screw up a dish irrevocably if you overuse them .
Here ’s an illustrative example .
If you double the amount of onions in a vegetable soup , does that really change the fundamental taste or format of the recipe ?
Uh , no .
Not at all .
But if you double the amount of salt or if you double the amount of Tabasco ( heaven help your wimpy - palated dinner guests if you do this … ) , thatfundamentally change the taste of the recipe - - probably for the worse .
So , I want you to be mindful of what types of ingredients ( like onions ) are additive , and what types of ingredients ( like salt , Tabasco , as well as most other spices ) are multiplicative .
The latter are the kinds of ingredients that can easily ruin your dish if you overdo it .
You might be risking an entire meal by " overexperimenting .
"
If there ’s an ingredient or a spice you think you ’d like to add but are concerned about going “ over the top , ” just be sure to make a less aggressive modification on the first try .
Jot a note to yourself on the recipe about the change you made and whether you think it could use still more .
By iterating this way , you 'll perfect the recipe without risking a ruined dinner .
Start thinking of your recipes as living things .
They can grow and mature along with your palate .
They can change and iterate with your whims .
Rarely do recipes come out perfectly formed and optimized for your tastes the first time you make them .
Take notes .
Keep records .
Leave room on your recipe cards for writing down your experiments and how they worked out .
Record what changes you made and use those prior changes as a platform for future changes .
Your notes will help you remember where you left off with the last time ( hmmmm … did I already double the Tabasco last time when it came out too spicy or did I plan to double it THIS time ??? ) , and they 'll prevent you from repeating mistakes you 've already made ( eg : “ cook the granola for 30 minutes , not 40 , and be sure to stir it this time or it will burn ! ! ” ) .
Of course , at some point a recipe might reach maturity -- it gets to a point where you 're totally happy with it and do n't feel the need to make more changes .
And to drag out the evolution metaphor still further , sometimes recipes go through a sort of punctuated equilibrium , where they see saw several steps of radical change over a very short period of time , but then remain pretty stable thereafter .
My Chicken
Mole is one such dish .
Look for more on this subject of modifications as we tackle more complex examples !

It ’s a funny thing , but I think I ’ve learned more about motivation this year from studying sales and marketing techinques , than I have from all my prior years of reading self - help books .
On the other hand , it ’s not really that surprising .
Marketers spend enormous amounts of time and money trying to figure out how to get people to do things , and they absolutely care about results .
They know it ’s not enough to get you to think about something , or have a general idea that you should do something , they have to get you to take immediate action .
And you see , it ’s common knowledge that the technically “ best ” products are often beaten in the market by “ inferior ” products that nonetheless have better marketing .
But this is exactly the same thing as a common self - help issue !
That is , even when you know you should do something , you do n’t always do it .
You know intellectually that it ’s better to quit smoking or exercise or whatever , but that does n’t automatically translate into doing it .
The truth is , we do n’t take action for reasons , we take action because of feelings .
Marketers know this , and they use it to get us to buy their products .
But you can learn this too , and use it to get yourself to do the things you know you should .
And a lot of my readers already know this .
Almost one third of the people who signed up for my Seven Days to Live Your Dreams coaching program explicitly mentioned my marketing “ pitch ” as an important factor in their decision .
And in the last month or so , many people who bought my book actually thanked me for creating “ limited time offers ” .
The deadlines , they said , were just the thing that got them out of thinking about getting the book , and into doing something about it .
And so today I started thinking , “ What if people could use the same principles to motivate themselves to do things ?
And what marketing secrets would they need to know to do it ? ”
Secret # 1 : Ask , “ What ’s in it for me ? ”
Marketers know that the number one thing they must convey is not the features of their product , but the benefit you ’ll get from having it .
That ’s why , when they advertise exercise equipment on TV , it ’s always being demonstrated by somebody who ’s so fit they obviously do n’t need any exercise equipment !
So when you think about your goals , it ’s really important that you focus on what you ’re going to get from having the goal , not what it ’s going to take you to get it .
As the old saying goes , “ obstacles are those frightful things you see when you take your eyes off your goal ! ”
Secret # 2 : Trust Your Feelings , Luke
Marketers know that nobody does anything for reasons .
People act because of feelings .
Now , it ’s easy to believe this does n’t apply to you , and that it ’s really just everybody else that does this .
But absolutely nobody is immune .
In fact , science has recently shown that the brain centers that govern conscious intentions ( backed by reasoning ) are completely unconnected to the parts that actually co-ordinate short - term actions and motor control !
The idea that you do things for “ reasons ” is in fact nothing more than an illusion .
That ’s why , when your intentions and your feelings are in conflict , your feelings always win .
So , you have to feel your goals , by being able to envision them with sufficient detail that you can feel the emotions you would have if you already had the thing you want .
Again , advertisers do this by presenting you with pictures .
If they ’re selling sports cars , they show the car zooming around curves or they show women behaving as if they think the driver is sexy .
The purpose ?
To inspire you to feel what it would be like to have what they ’re offering .
Not to convince your rational mind that you ’re actually ever going to go that fast or be found attractive by the opposite sex !
Secret # 3 : Appeal to the “ Baser Instincts ”
Society teaches us to be ashamed of many of our desires : desires for sex or attractiveness , desires for prestige or superiority to others , the desire for revenge or to “ show them ” , etc .
But advertisers are not ashamed to tap into these desires in order to sell their products , and neither should you be ashamed to use them to leverage yourself into action .
For example , if one of your reasons for exercising is that you want to look better than so - and - so , or show somebody else that you really “ can so ” change your life if you want , then by all means , USE IT !
When you think of exercise , think of accomplishing your goal and how nice it will feel to be better than that person or to show them or whatever .
Imagine your smug inner feeling of superiority when you lord it over them !
Or think about how nice it will be for people to look at you with desire , and bask in the warm glow of inner confidence as they do .
So , no matter what it it is you secretly desire , and no matter whether you would ever admit it to anyone , this is precisely the kind of juicy stuff that your “ feeling brain ” and “ action brain ” positively thrive on .
Saying stuff like “ I should be healthy ” , however , does absolutely nothing .
Just think about it .
If ideas like “ I should be healthy ” could actually motivate you to do something , do n’t you think advertisers would put those ideas in their commercials ?
Would n’t they say something like , “ You should be healthy !
Call now ! ”
But , have you ever seen an ad like that ?
I do n’t think I ’ve ever seen even one .
Maybe somebody has run an ad like that , but they probably did n’t stay in business very long .
Secret # 4 : Make the Actions Clear , Easy , and Specific
Marketers know that it does n’t do any good to get you all riled up and motivated , and then not give you a way to get the product !
They also know they have to tell you step - by - step what to do to get the product .
That ’s why they do n’t just put their phone number and website on the screen , they tell you to pick up the phone and dial the number , and to “ have your credit card ready ” .
Why do they do this ?
Because when they do n’t do it , they make less money .
The more a person has to work to figure out what to do , the more likely they are to abandon their initial idea of acting on the message they ’ve just seen or heard .
This is because the “ action plans ” part of your brain is n’t really very bright .
It needs step - by - step instructions .
If somebody is consciously motivated , they might pass the necessary instructions to their brain ’s “ action ” part .
But , this is n’t nearly as effective as just giving the action brain the necessary steps to begin with .
I see this in action all the time on my blog .
When I write about my book and how good it would be to have a copy because of all the good things you ’ll learn from it , I do get some sales .
But when I write about my book and tell you to click here now to order the book that ’s going to change your life forever , I get a lot more !
So when you want to take action , you need to have a plan of action , broken down into simple steps .
You ’ve got to make it simple enough that you can get your “ action brain ” to do it on its own .
If you have to think about it , it ’s too hard !
Make it simpler .
For example , if you have to think about which exercises to do , write it down , and make your action plan as simple as this :
Look at the list .
Do the next exercise on the list !
If you have to think about how to do a particular exercise , then practice it .
Go through the motions physically a few times without weight or at a low intensity .
Then mentally repeat the steps in your mind , over and over and over again , until it becomes automatic enough to be done without thinking .
By the way , did you notice that I just said to do that “ mentally … in your mind ” ?
That ’s an example of how blatantly simple and clear and specific you have to be , to the point of redundancy … just like a TV ad that tells you the phone number five times , and then tells you to call it now six times !
Secret # 5 : Set a Deadline for Taking Action … NOW !
Why do marketers always tell you to act now ?
I mean , is n’t it good enough to just act when you get around to it ?
No , because your your “ action brain ” only understands the present .
It does n’t do “ later ” .
All it knows is whether it ’s currently time to run some particular “ action sequence ” .
Everything , therefore , is either “ now ” or “ not now ” .
And if it ’s “ not now ” , the action brain does nothing .
The action brain ’s job is just to do whatever is supposed to be happening “ now ” .
Unfortunately for us self - helpers , the action brain ’s idea of what should be done at a particular time is not based on clocks or schedules or to - do lists , it ’s based on context and “ priming ” .
The action brain responds to environmental cues ( like where you are ) , social cues ( like who you ’re with and what moods they ’re in ) , and internal cues ( like how you feel ) , in order to determine what action programs to run .
Verbal commands ( or even words you overhear in passing ) are also powerful context cues .
( By the way , that ’s another reason why marketers tell you to do it now , because “ now ” is a verbal cue that something actually needs to be done … now . )
But sometimes just saying that it should be done “ now ” is n’t enough .
For a lot of us , a lot of the time , it ’s the feeling of deadline pressure associated with a task that cues our action brain that it really does need to be done now .
Without that pressure , we can tell ourselves all day long that it should be done now , but our brains wo n’t believe us .
So use that .
Create a deadline if you have to .
But also use other context cues , especially ones that are sensory in nature .
For example , Instead of deciding to exercise every day at 8 am , decide that you will exercise “ before breakfast ” , and refuse to have breakfast until you have exercised .
This will train your action brain that the “ breakfast ” sequence now begins with exercise !
Secret # 6 : Create an Incentive for Taking Action
If you refuse to have breakfast before you exercise , then you have to exercise or you will lose breakfast .
Marketers call this a “ take - away ” , and they use it by creating sales , limited time offers , limited quantities , and so on , to create a real or artificial urgency , based on a desire to get ( or keep ) something that you will otherwise lose .
For a variety of evolutionary reasons , our “ feeling brains ” react far more strongly to fear of loss than desire for gain .
Imagine how much harder you would work to avoid losing $ 100 , than to earn $ 100 , for example !
So , succesful change programs often involve some personal incentive as well .
For example , paying a personal trainer to help you exercise can be very motivating , because if you do n’t exercise , you will be losing money .
Perhaps even worse , you ’ll be embarassed to tell your trainer you ’re quitting !
This is one way in which “ betting on yourself ” is beneficial to change .
Another example : before I produced my book for sale , I created a corporation and opened a merchant account so it could accept credit cards … almost two months before the book was finally ready to sell .
I did it precisely because it would feel really embarassing to keep paying $ 26 every month for the account without having any orders to process !
That way , I knew I would n’t dawdle around for months trying to create a “ perfect ” product , but would instead focus on creating an actionable product .
That is , a finished product .
So apply this to your goals as well .
How can you set things up so you ’ll lose something if you do n’t follow through ?
I call this “ betting on yourself ” , and I believe it ’s one of the key reasons why people who use coaching programs , personal trainers , etc. are so much more likely to be successful at achieving their goals than people who go it alone .
Secret # 7 : Ask for What You Want , EVERY SINGLE DAY
No sane marketer runs an ad just once .
To cut through the noise , you need repetition , repetition , repetition .
Do n’t envision your goals once : do it a hundred times .
Do n’t envision how you will take action once : do it a thousand times .
And do n’t feel like you have to do it differently , either .
Remember , the exact same ads are often run year after year after year .
If you are creating the right mental “ ads ” for your goals , you wo n’t need to change them .
Just “ run ” them in your head .
Again , and again , and again .
The conscious mind thinks that this is unnecessary and redundant , because it already “ knows ” that your goal is “ a good idea ” .
But ignore your conscious mind ’s blathering , because it ’s not qualified to know what works for the “ feeling brain ” and “ action brain ” .
If knowing that it ’s a good idea were enough to produce action , we would all be freakin’ saints by now !
So do n’t pay any attention to what your conscious mind says .
Your feeling brain can run the same mental scenarios over and over and over , and produce the same feelings every time .
And those feelings will then set the context cues for the action brain to act on , time after time .
Therefore , you must ask for what you want , every single day , by envisioning what results you want , and by feeling the feelings of having what you want .
Just like I ask you , day after day , to buy my book and attend my workshops , by telling you how wonderful your life is going to be when you do .
It ’s just that simple .

P.S. The workshop prices for Seven Days to Live Your Dreams just went up significantly , as I warned that they would .
That ’s because , if you create deadlines and incentive , you have to follow through on them , or your action brain will know you ’re not really serious next time !
However , there is still time left to get a free MP3 of the Banish Unwanted Feelings Forever workshop , and to register for the “ Instant .

The Orang Utan , one of man 's closest and most enigmatic cousins , could be virtually extinct within five years after it was discovered that the animal 's rainforest habitat is being destroyed even more rapidly than had been predicted .
A United Nations report has found that illegal logging and fires have been overtaken as the primary cause of deforestation by a huge expansion of oil palm plantations , which are racing to meet soaring demand from Western food manufacturers and the European Union 's zeal for biofuels .
Palm oil is seen by critics as a cautionary tale about good intentions .
As a vegetable oil it can enhance a healthy diet , and as a biofuel it can reduce carbon emissions which contribute to climate change .
Yet it transpires that humans ' pursuit of an ethical lifestyle could inadvertently mean a death sentence for one of the great apes .
The paradox was brought to world attention by Friends of the Earth , whose ongoing campaign for producers , manufacturers and retailers to commit to sustainable palm oil was recognised at last week 's Observer Food Monthly awards with the honour for best ethical contribution to the industry .
The UN 's environment programme report , ' The Last Stand of the Orang Utan : State of Emergency ' , says natural rainforests of Indonesia and Malaysia are being cleared so rapidly that up to 98 per cent may be destroyed by 2022 , and the lowland forest strongholds of orang utans much sooner , unless urgent action is taken .
This is a full decade earlier than the previous report estimated when it was published five years ago .
Overall the loss of orang utan habitat is happening 30 per cent more rapidly than had previously been thought .
Responding to the findings , the Borneo Orang Utan Survival Foundation UK , a charity which works to rescue , rehabilitate and release the animals into protected forest , warned that at the current rate of deforestation by the palm oil industry , orang utans in the wild could be close to extinction by 2012 .
Sir David Attenborough , the broadcaster and naturalist , told The Observer : ' Every bit of the rainforest that is knocked down is less space for orangs .
They have been reduced very seriously in the past decade .
Western governments and companies need to be proactive .'
Satellite images reveal that illegal logging is now taking place in 37 out of 41 national parks in Indonesia and is probably still on the increase .
The report says : ' At current rates of intrusions , it is likely that some parks may become severely degraded in as little as three to five years , that is by 2012 . '
The UN also highlights the growing threat posed by palm oil harvesting , noting that large areas of Indonesian and Malaysian forest have been cleared to make way for plantations .
As consumer awareness about healthy eating and ethical shopping grows , palm oil is an increasingly popular alternative to trans fatty acids - more closely associated with heart disease - and is found in one in 10 supermarket products including margarine , baked goods and sweets , as well as detergents and lipsticks .
There has been much soul searching among environmentalists because palm oil is also in demand for biofuels , seen as one of the best ways of reducing dependence on fossil fuels and so combating global warming .
Palm oil is currently considered the most productive source of biodiesel fuel , and Indonesia and Malaysia account for 83 per cent of its global production .
Since 2003 the European Union has been among the chief culprits .
Its biofuels progress report earlier this year specified Indonesia among the list of countries for cheap biofuel production , prompting Greenpeace to warn : ' Booming EU demand for biofuels could kill Indonesian forests . '
Britain imports one million tonnes every year , double what it did in 1995 .
But the new UN report warns : ' Today , the rapid increase in [ oil palm ] plantation acreage is one of the greatest threats to orang utans and the forests on which they depend .
In Malaysia and Indonesia , it is now the primary cause of permanent rainforest loss .
The huge demand for this versatile product makes it very difficult to curb the spread of plantations . '
Displaced from their rainforest habitat , the orang utans struggle to survive in the oil palm plantations and are regarded as an agricultural pest .
Mindful of the potential loss in profits , farmers have carried out a vicious extermination programme .
Michelle Desilets , director of the Borneo Orang Utan Survival Foundation UK , said : ' They are left hungry so they go in search of food in the plantations and destroy the plants .
They become easy targets .
Some plantation owners put a bounty of $ 10 or $ 20 on the head of orangutans , which is worth a few weeks ' salary for the workers .
' Workers do n't usually have guns : the orang utans that get shot are the lucky ones .
We 've seen them beaten to death with wood sticks or iron bars , doused in petrol and set on fire , trussed up in nets or tied up with wire which cuts through their flesh .
Often a mother is killed and eaten while its baby is sold on or kept as a pet .
In the local plantations where we 're working , the managers have now agreed not to offer the bonus .
But there 's still a macho thing about bringing down an adult male . '
The foundation 's struggle to save the animals will be shown in the series Orang Utan Diary starting on BBC2 on 2 April .
Desilets said that the palm oil industry was now a severe threat to orang utans ' very existence .
' The plantations are huge , the size of a county in England : you can drive for two hours and you 're still in one .
In the UK , when a product says " vegetable oil " it might mean palm oil , so you 're not aware that you might be party to this killing .
We put the functional survival of orang utans in the wild at no more than five years .
There will always be some remote pockets but the population will be too small to reproduce and in one or two generations it will die out .
When the last orang utan dies I will give up all hope in humanity .
But for the time being we still have hope . '
Campaigners will move up a gear this week .
Hardi Baktiantoro , director of Indonesia 's Centre for Orang Utan Protection , has flown to Britain to work with the group Nature Alert to push for greater accountability .
He said : ' With my own hands I have rescued countless baby orang utans orphaned by palm oil companies .
With my eyes I have witnessed these same companies extinguish all natural life where pristine rainforests once stood .
The situation is so desperate in Indonesia that I have come to Great Britain to ask for help with introducing Orang Utan Friendly palm oil into food and other household products . '
After a year of hard campaigning , including demonstrations outside stores , Friends of the Earth persuaded Tesco and other supermarkets to work with producers and manufacturers on a scheme for certifying sustainable palm oil which should include labelling products so consumers can be sure they are not buying from a source which harms orang utans .
Supermarkets said they were trying to tackle the issue although they have been criticised for moving too slowly .
A spokesman for Tesco said : ' We are deeply concerned about the loss of rainforest - and the orang utans it supports - and believe that we can make a real contribution to work on this important area .
It is a complex problem . '
Sean Sutcliffe , chief executive of the Biofuels Corporation , the biggest biofuels company in the UK , said : ' The existing deforestation is driven by demand from food and cosmetics .
Palm oil should be part of the solution : the key is to make sure that standards are put in place . '
People of the forest
· Their name is derived from the Malay words ' orang hutan ' , which literally mean ' person of the forest ' .
· The orang utan is one of man 's closest relatives in the animal kingdom , sharing 96.4 per cent of our DNA .
· Orang utans are the biggest tree - dwelling animals in the world .
Adult males stand four and a half feet tall and weigh 130 to 200 pounds .
· The wild population is thought to be 40 - 50,000 , half the number that existed 20 years ago .
· They spend most of their time alone once they reach maturity .

Percentage who say they 're confident , proud of Iraq war drops by more than half
• In 2003 , 83 percent of Americans said they were confident , 65 percent proud
• 61 percent of those polled now say it was not worth invading Iraq , poll says
• Support for Afghanistan war drops from 88 percent in 2001 to 53 percent today

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Americans are starkly less confident and proud of their country 's involvement in Iraq , according to poll results released Sunday .
However , the poll -- results of which were released on the eve of the Iraq war 's 4 - year anniversary -- also indicated that Americans are no more worried about the conflict than they were when it began in March 2003 .
The CNN poll of 1,027 adults was conducted March 9 - 11 by Opinion Research Corp .
The sampling error for the poll is plus or minus 3 percentage points .
According to the results , 35 percent of Americans are confident about the war , the poll said .
When the war began , 83 percent of Americans expressed confidence in the campaign .
Similarly , 30 percent of those polled this month said they were proud of the war , as opposed to 65 percent who expressed that sentiment in 2003 .
The poll also showed that 33 percent of Americans are afraid of the war and 55 percent are worried by it .
Those percentages are roughly the same as they were four years ago .
Sunday 's results came on the heels of a Saturday release indicating that years of war had whittled away at Americans ' support for the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan .
When the Iraq war began , 68 percent of Americans said they felt the situation in the country was worth fighting over .
Now , 61 percent of those surveyed say it was not worth invading Iraq , according to the poll .
That survey of 1,027 adults by Opinion Research Corp. was conducted by telephone March 9 - 11 as well .
It has a sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points .
The poll showed that support for the Iraq war had dwindled to 35 percent .
In 2004 , support for the war was about 56 percent .
Last year , the number dipped to 37 percent , and today about 35 percent of Americans say they support the war , according to the poll .
Support for the war in Afghanistan also has seen a considerable decline as 88 percent of those polled in 2001 said they were behind the conflict .
This month 's poll indicates that support lingers around 53 percent .
Also , according to the poll , about 55 percent of Americans feel the war in Afghanistan is " going badly , " according to the poll .
CNN 's Keating Holland contributed to this report .
When writing CTM I was struck with how many of the good ideas in programming languages were discovered early on .
The decade 1964 - 1974 seems to have been a " Golden Age " : most of the good ideas of programming languages appeared then .
For example :
Functional programming : Landin's SECD machine ( 1964 )
Object - oriented programming : Dahl and Nygaard 's Simula ( 1966 )
Axiomatic semantics : Hoare ( 1969 )
Logic programming : Elcock 's Absys ( 1965 ) , Colmerauer 's Prolog ( 1972 )
Backtracking : Floyd ( 1967 )
Capability security : Dennis and Van Horn ( 1965 )
Declarative concurrency : Kahn ( 1974 )
Message - passing concurrency : Hewitt 's Actor model ( 1973 )
Shared - state concurrency : Hoare 's monitors ( 1974 )
Software engineering : Brooks 's mythical man-month ( 1974 )
It is a sobering thought that not much new stuff has come since then .
Hindley - Milner type inferencing in 1978 , constraint programming in 1980 , CCS ( precursor of pi-calculus ) in 1980 .
What revolutionary new ideas came since 1980 ?
Most of the work since then seems to have been in consolidation and integration ( combining the power of the different ideas ) .
Right ?

According to Sir Martin Rees , author of Our Final Century , astronomer royal and professor of cosmology and astrophysics at the University of Cambridge , humans only have a 50 - 50 chance of making it through the 21st century without serious setback .
" Some natural threats , such as earthquakes and meteorite impacts , remain the same throughout time , while others are aggravated by our modern - interconnected world .
But now we also need to consider threats that are human induced . "
So what are the greatest threats to humans and can we do anything about them ?
Below , 10 scientists talk about their greatest fears and explain how society could be affected .
Afterwards we estimate each threat in two ways : first , the chance of it occurring in our lifetime ( the next 70 years ) ; and , second , the danger that it would pose to the human race if it did happen ( 10 = making humans extinct , to one = barely having an impact on our lives ) .
1 : Climate Change
Nick Brooks is a senior research associate at the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research at the University of East Anglia :
" By the end of this century it is likely that greenhouse gases will have doubled and the average global tempera­ture will have risen by at least 2C .
This is hotter than anything the Earth has experienced in the last one and a half million years .
In the worst case scenario it could completely alter the climate in many regions of the world .
This could lead to global food insecurity and the widespread collapse of existing social systems , causing mass migration and conflict over resources as some parts of the world become much less habitable .
I do n't think that climate change will sound the death knell for humans , but it certainly has the potential to devastate . "
Chance of temperatures rising more than 2C ( the level considered to be dangerous by the European Union ) in the next 70 years : High
Danger score : 6
2 : Telomere erosion
Reinhard Stindl , a medical doctor at the University of Vienna , says every species contains an " evolutionary clock " , ticking through the generations and counting down towards an inevitable extinction date :
" On the end of every animal 's chromosomes are protective caps called telomeres .
Without them our chromosomes would become unstable .
Each time a cell divides it never quite copies its telomere completely and throughout our lifetime the telomeres become shorter and shorter as the cells multiply .
Eventually , when they become critically short , we start to see age - related diseases , such as cancer , Alzheimer 's , heart attacks and strokes .
" However , it is not just through our lifetime that telomeres get shorter .
My theory is that there is a tiny loss of telomere length from one generation to the next , mirroring the process of ageing in individuals .
Over thousands of generations the telomere gets eroded down to its critical level .
Once at the critical level we would expect to see outbreaks of age - related diseases occurring earlier in life and finally a population crash .
Telomere erosion could explain the disappearance of a seemingly successful species , such as Neanderthal man , with no need for external factors such as climate change . "
Chances of a human population crash due to telomere erosion during the next 70 years : Low
Danger score : 8
3 : Viral Pandemic
Professor Maria Zambon is a virologist and head of the Health Protection Agency 's Influenza Laboratory :
" Within the last century we have had four major flu epidemics , along with HIV and Sars .
Major pandemics sweep the world every century , and it is inevitable that at least one will occur in the future .
At the moment the most serious concern is H5 avian influenza in chickens in south - east Asia .
If this virus learns to transmit from human to human then it could sweep rapidly around the world .
The 1918 influenza outbreak caused 20 m deaths in just one year : more than all the people killed in the first world war .
A similar outbreak now could have a perhaps more devastating impact .
" It is not in the interests of a virus to kill all of its hosts , so a virus is unlikely to wipe out the human race , but it could cause a serious setback for a number of years .
We can never be completely prepared for what nature will do : nature is the ultimate bioterrorist . "
Chance of a viral pandemic in the next 70 years :
Very high
Danger score : 3
4 : Terrorism
Professor Paul Wilkinson is chairman of the advisory board for the Centre for the Study of Terrorism and Political Violence at the University of St Andrews :
" Today 's society is more vulnerable to terrorism because it is easier for a malevolent group to get hold of the necessary materials , technology and expertise to make weapons of mass destruction .
The most likely cause of large scale , mass - casualty terrorism right now is from a chemical or biological weapon .
The large - scale release of something like anthrax , the smallpox virus , or the plague , would have a huge effect , and modern communications would quickly make it become a trans-national problem .
" In an open society , where we value freedoms of movement , we can't guar­antee stopping an attack , and there is a very high probability that a major attack will occur somewhere in the world , within our lifetimes . "
Chances of a major terrorist attack in the next 70 years : Very high
Danger score : 2
5 : Nuclear war
Air Marshal Lord Garden is Liberal Democrat defence spokesman and author of Can Deterrence Last ? :
" In theory , a nuclear war could destroy the human civilisation but in practice I think the time of that danger has probably passed .
There are three potential nuclear flashpoints today : the Middle East , India - Pakistan and North Korea .
Of these , North Korea is the most worrying , with a hair - trigger , conventional army that might start a war by accident .
But I like to believe the barriers against using a nuclear weapon remain high because of the way we have developed an international system to restrain nuclear use .
" The probability of nuclear war on a global scale is low , even if there remains the possibility of nuclear use by a rogue state or fanatical extremists . "
Chance of a global nuclear war in the next 70 years : Low
Danger score : 8
6 : Meteorite impact
Donald Yeomans is manager of Nasa 's Near Earth Object Program Office at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California :
" Over very long timescales , the risk of you dying as a result of a near - Earth object impact is roughly equivalent to the risk of dying in an aeroplane accident .
To cause a serious setback to our civilisation , the impactor would have to be around 1.5 km wide or larger .
We expect an event of this type every million years on average .
The dangers associated with such a large impactor include an enormous amount of dust in the atmosphere , which would substantially shut down sunlight for weeks , thus affecting plant life and crops that sustain life .
There would be global firestorms as a result of re-entering hot ejecta and severe acid rain .
All of these effects are relatively short - term , so the most adaptable species ( cockroaches and humans , for example ) would be likely to survive . "
Chance of the Earth being hit by a large asteroid in the next 70 years : Medium
Danger score : 5
7 : Robots taking over
Hans Moravec is a research professor at Carnegie Mellon University 's Robotics Institute in Pittsburgh :
" Robot controllers double in complexity ( processing power ) every year or two .
They are now barely at the lower range of vertebrate complexity , but should catch up with us within a half - century .
By 2050 I predict that there will be robots with humanlike mental power , with the ability to abstract and generalise .
" These intelligent machines will grow from us , learn our skills , share our goals and values , and can be viewed as children of our minds .
Not only will these robots look after us in the home , but they will also carry out complex tasks that currently require human input , such as diagnosing illness and recommending a therapy or cure .
They will be our heirs and will offer us the best chance we 'll ever get for immortality by uploading ourselves into advanced robots . "
Chance of super - intelligent robots in the next 70 years : High
Danger score : 8
8 : Cosmic ray blast from exploding star
Nir Shaviv is a senior lecturer in physics at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem , Israel :
" Once every few decades a massive star from our galaxy , the Milky Way , runs out of fuel and explodes , in what is known as a supernova .
Cosmic rays ( high - energy particles like gamma rays ) spew out in all directions and if the Earth happens to be in the way , they can trigger an ice age .
If the Earth already has a cold climate then an extra burst of cosmic rays could make things really icy and perhaps cause a number of species to become extinct .
The Earth is at greatest risk when it passes through a spiral arm of the Milky Way , where most of the supernova occur .
This happens approximately every 150 m years .
Paleoclimate indicators show that there has been a corresponding cold period on Earth , with more ice at the poles and many ice ages during these times .
" We are nearly out of the Sagittarius - Carina arm of the Milky Way now and Earth should have a warmer climate in a few million years .
But , in around 60 m years we will enter the Perseus arm and ice - house conditions are likely to dominate again . "
Chance of encountering a supernova in the next 70 years : Low
Danger score : 4
9 : Super-volcanos
Professor Bill McGuire is director of the Benfield Hazard Research Centre at University College London and a member of Tony Blair 's Natural Hazards working group :
" Approximately every 50,000 years the Earth experiences a super - volcano .
More than 1,000 sq km of land can be obliterated by pyroclastic ash flows , the surrounding continent is coated in ash and sulphur gases are injected into the atmosphere , making a thin veil of sulphuric acid all around the globe and reflecting back sunlight for years to come .
Daytime becomes no brighter than a moonlit night .
" The global damage from a super - volcano depends on where it is and how long the gas stays in the atmosphere .
Taupo in New Zealand was the most recent super - volcano , around 26,500 years ago .
However , the most damaging super - volcano in human history was Toba , on Sumatra , Indonesia , 74,000 years ago .
Because it was fairly close to the equator it injected gas quickly into both hemispheres .
Ice core data shows that temperatures were dramatically reduced for five to six years afterwards , with freezing conditions right down to the tropics .
" A super - volcano is 12 times more likely than a large meteorite impact .
There is a 0.15 % probability that one will happen in your lifetime .
Places to watch now are those that have erupted in the past , such as Yellowstone in the US and Toba .
But , even more worryingly , a super - volcano could also burst out from somewhere that has never erupted before , such as under the Amazon rainforest . "
Chance of a super - volcano in the next 70 years :
Very high
Danger score : 7
10 : Earth swallowed by a black hole
Richard Wilson is Mallinckrodt Research Professor of Physics at Harvard University in the US :
" Around seven years ago , when the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider was being built at the Brookhaven National Laboratory in New York , there was a worry that a state of dense matter could be formed that had never been created before .
At the time this was the largest particle accelerator to have been built , making gold ions crash head on with immense force .
The risk was that this might form a stage that was sufficiently dense to be like a black hole , gathering matter from the outside .
Would the Brookhaven labs ( and perhaps the entire Earth ) end up being swallowed by a black hole created by the new accelerator ?
" Using the information we already know from black holes in outer space , we did some calculations to find out if the Brookhaven particle accelerator was capable of forming such a black hole .
We are now pretty certain this state of matter wo n't form at Brookhaven and that the Earth wo n't be swallowed when these particles collide . "
Chance of Earth being gobbled up by a black hole in the next 70 years : Exceedingly low
Danger score : 10

in reply to What is YOUR Development Process ?
Everything is under source control I use Subversion , and recommend it highly .
Everything has an automated test that , at the bare minimum , verifies that it will compile .
Preferably , everything is tested to at least 95 % coverage , with 99 % being the goal .
Everything is developed and tested in the developer 's environment .
This may be a separate machine or it may be a separate port on the same machine .
I 've done both and there 's no benefit vis -a - vis development process .
If you check something in , you 're asserting that you have done at least some manner of testing .
In other words , HEAD will , at the very least , compile .
Either the full test suite is run whenever a checkin occurs ( ideal ) and / or it runs nightly on some smoke server ( good ) .
Best is both .
Did I mention that EVERYTHING is under source control ?
This includes anything that your application might need in order to run .
Any external items ( CPAN modules , system commands , etc ) and their versions ( min and max ) are marked as dependencies somewhere in the installation script .
It is so annoying when you try and install something and it breaks because it forgot a dependency .
( The automake19 port on FreeBSD 5.3 has this problem . )
Everything that happens in the application is logged .
Every request , who made the request and from where , how long it took , and if there were any errors .
If you have the space ( and you probably do ) , log the response as well .
Tracing errors is a lot easier when you can see exactly what your app sent back in response to what .
If an error occurs on prod , it should , at the very least , email someone .
Preferably , someone gets paged .
Customers love it when you call them 15 minutes after the site says " I can't let you do that , Dave. " , apologize for the inconvenience , and inform them of both a workaround and that the problem has been logged as a bug .
If you have a pager , rotate it .
That way , everyone gets experience .
If you do n't have code reviews , write each other 's tests .
You have to , at the very least , have working familiarity with the APIs that your colleagues are working on .
Otherwise , how can you possibly suggest improvements at the time when it 's cheapest to make those changes ?
The dev machine / dev port is for developer integration testing .
It 's also useful for demonstrating to management how the new unfinished feature will look like .
There is a completely separate environment called " test " .
Ideally , this is on a separate machine in order to test the upgrade protocol , but it does n't have to be .
This is the place where the testers test and , most likely , UAT will occur here .
Every modification to the application has a change request associated with it .
This means features , enhancements , bugs , and retirements .
They are all change requests and need to be identified .
All checkins ( ideally ) are for a single change request and should be marked with the request ID .
When doing an upgrade , every action is scripted .
This means that if a table has to change , the ALTER TABLE statement (s ) are in a script , preferably identified by the change request ID that it is handling .
If the upgrade is complex , there should be a single master script that will call all the other scripts to do the work .
These scripted actions are how you move changes from dev to test .
There is a prod environment .
This will probably be multiple machines .
No -one is ever logged into prod .
Ever .
There is one single person responsible for any given install .
Ideally , each person gets to handle a prod install .
That person is the only person allowed to " pull the trigger " on the install .
In other words , they are the only person logged into that machine during the install window .
And , this is the only exception to the prior rule .
There is a maintenance window on prod where the client understands installations may be occurring .
Unless it is a crash - bug , this should be the only time changes are made to prod .
Period .
Let me repeat - Prod is sacrosanct .
If you need to find something , look in the logs .
That 's what they 're for .
If you can't find it there , log it for next time .
Every time you touch prod , YOU WILL BREAK IT .
My criteria for good software : Does it work ?
Can someone else come in , make a change , and be reasonably certain no bugs were introduced ?
My criteria for good software : I do web apps .

Do you also mount /usr / local so that both servers mount from the same physical location ?
That way , you guarantee that the perl installs are identical ...

No idea !
After peer review I just commit my code and submit a ticket to QA with a description of the change .
Beyond that it 's kinda blurry as Operations do n't let you peek over the fence much and I 'm no server side guy :)

by Anonymous Monk on Jul 09 , 2006 at 02:30 UTC
I 'm just another anonymouse sysadmin , but I wanted to make one comment :
There needs to be a way to back - port the prod environment into test ( and possibly even to dev ) .
This way you can recover from situations where the upstream environments have become gunked - up with oddities that just naturally happen during the dev-test - prod cycle .
And this backport from prod to test needs to be either a script , or a full backup / restore cycle , to ensure complete fidelity to prod .

Bra That Doubles As Shopping Bag
File this under : “ Strange Japanese Inventions ” Triumph Japan has unveiled a bra that doubles as a shopping bag — named the “ Kawaii Bag ” .
Here ’s how it works :
When the bra is being worn , the “ shopping bag ” portions are folded away inside the bra cups , where they serve as extra padding .
The bra quickly converts to a shopping bag by removing the bag portions from the cups and connecting the hooks on the bra ’s underwire .
The lace cups serve as decoration along with the shoulder straps , which are disconnected and tied to the top of the bag as ribbons

Forget duck ;
Peking has been overrun by pigs .
As the Chinese New Year approaches , heralding the auspicious Year of the Pig , porkers are everywhere .
Fifteen - foot - high inflatable pigs beckon shoppers into electronics stores ; fluffy pink pig snouts enliven winter ear - muffs ; corkscrew tails and round piggy faces decorate Ikea kitchen aprons .
Wherever you look , happy hogs are rearing up on their hind trotters advertising this or that , or simply waving banners emblazoned with the new Chinese credo , for which the coming year is believed to be especially favorable : " Get Rich . "
Advertising and commercial pressures have swept superstitious consumers into a froth of excitement that reveals how much many Chinese today hope that traditional fortunetelling tools can enrich them as they pursue former Supreme Leader Deng Xiaoping 's famously un-Communist exhortation , " To get rich is glorious . "
Fortune telling , an ancient Chinese art officially frowned upon by the country 's Communist authorities , is a booming industry in modern China .
People 's belief in divination , life charts , geomancy , and simple lucky numbers is on the rise , say practitioners , followers , and sociologists .
The mania for making money that is sweeping the country offers lucrative opportunities for charlatans of all kinds .
Pigs are especially popular in the Chinese mind , summoning images of good - natured generosity and good fortune .
So closely are the animals linked to human life here that the Chinese character for " home " includes the symbols for both roof and pig – all you need for a traditional Chinese household .
This year , moreover , is being proclaimed the Year of the Golden Pig , a doubly propitious period thanks to a combination of animals and elements in the Chinese zodiac that matches pigs and gold only once every 60 years .
It is said that 2007 is the year to have a baby ; anyone born under the coming year 's sign is bound to be lucky .
Except that even if you believe in China 's mystical soothsayers , that is not true .
You will not find a reputable Chinese astrologer who reads the charts that way .
2007 is actually the Year of the Earthen Pig .
( Or possibly the Fire Pig , depending on your astrologer . )
But that does n't sell baby clothes , does it ?
Although no studies have been carried out , there is no doubt , says Zhou Xiaozheng an outspoken skeptic and sociology professor at Beijing 's Renmin University that " more and more people are becoming interested in traditional Chinese fortunetelling culture . "
That drives him mad .
" It is totally absurd , absolutely ludicrous , that buildings should not have a fourth floor , " he fulminates , simply because the Mandarin word for " four " sounds like the word meaning " death . "
Prof .
Zhou attributes the trend to helplessness .
" In a dictatorship ... people do not have the power to decide things for themselves , so they let fortune tellers forecast their destiny , " he argues .
" They turn to superstition for emotional consolation . "
That explanation is not all that far removed from the way Bao Tong , a wispy - bearded Taoist sage who consults the Yi Ching , or " Book of Changes , " sees things .
As a fortuneteller himself , though , he regards modern science , not his knowledge , as " superstition . "
" I realized that people 's destinies , their failure or success , are not necessarily related to the effort they put into their work , nor to their intelligence , " he says , recalling why he first became interested in the founding text of Chinese philosophy , the Yi Ching .
" There is a lot of unfairness in people 's lives , and I wanted to understand why . "
In a restful room decorated in natural colors to resemble an old Chinese teahouse , Mr. Bao says his clients fall into three main categories .
There are those who come to him for his knowledge of feng shui , the belief that the arrangement of rooms and furniture in a home or office that can be auspicious or inauspicious ; those who want predictions about their future ; and others seeking answers to specific questions they are facing in their lives .
" Friends can come round here for a chat , too , " Bao says with a smile , pouring another tiny porcelain cup of fragrant tea .
Bao draws on 20 years of study of Chinese astrology and ancient methods of divination to offer his advice .
Some of the charts he draws up are based on the markings found on the shell of a giant turtle taken from the Luo River more than 6,000 years ago , he says .
" The knowledge I have is the foundation of Chinese culture .
I am trying to promote my own faith , " he explains .
He does so through lectures and the occasional article in magazines .
His works dare to defy the government 's general ban on media coverage of a practice fiercely repressed under Mao Zedong and still officially scorned as feudal superstition .
" My friends are afraid I will get into trouble " he laughs .
" But I can predict when difficulties are likely to arise and avoid them .
If I could n't see trouble coming , I 'd be in the wrong business . "
Bao decries the wave of charlatans who he complains exploit ordinary people 's belief in lucky numbers , or the widely held view that 2007 will be a good year for babies but a bad year in which to get married .
" These ideas are baseless , " he scoffs .
" This is a chaotic time for ideas and opinions in China .
The people 's faith needs guidance . "
Recent years have seen a boom in religious belief generally , according to a study by two Shanghai professors published recently that estimated 31.4 percent of Chinese , or 300 million people , are religious – three times the official estimates .
Two - thirds of believers put their faith in traditional Chinese religions such as Buddhism and Taoism or in folk gods such as the Dragon King and the God of Fortune , says the report .
Most ordinary Chinese go to storefront soothsayers for feng shui help , or advice on personal and business affairs .
Wealthier citizens have the choice of visiting companies such as " Luckings , " a corporate prognosticator on the 19th floor of an office tower in North Beijing .
There they can consult counselors like Feng Shengting , a smooth young man in a powder blue jacket with a nice line in patter and impressive calligraphy .
In 15 minutes he can run you off a chart to help you make the right business decision for 1,500 RMB ( $ 195 ) , based solely on the time at which you walked through his door .
He claims an 85 percent accuracy rate .
His boss Wang Fenglin , who drums up business on a smartly designed website , charges $ 30 per square foot for a feng shui consultation in homes or offices and regularly lands contracts worth more than a million RMB ( $ 130,000 ) , says Mr. Feng .
" Our clients are politicians , businessmen , actors , entertainment celebrities , " Feng explains .
They want to know about the same things as everybody else , though , he says – " marriage , career , health , wealth , and children . "
Feng is blatant about the promises he holds out :
The only ornament on his wide wooden desk is a golden sculpture of a bejeweled stallion rearing from a pile of golden coins .
And indeed , laments Kevin Li , a thoughtful follower of Bao Tong , if feng shui and related mysteries are becoming more popular in China , it is simply because " more and more people are eager to make money , " and expect the fortunetellers to guide them .
Mr. Li , a leather - jacketed , thirty - something advertising man who consults Bao whenever he has a major decision to make , says that his Tao master 's guidance " makes my life wiser and more predictable .
It makes my heart calmer . "
But he acknowledges that he is a rare bird .
For the most part , he would reluctantly agree with Professor Zhou , who scoffs at his compatriots ' credulity .
" Today China lacks a belief , a certain faith , " he says .
" People believe only in money .
If fortune telling is becoming so popular , it 's more because they are fond of money than because they are fond of true faith . "
I love to ride my bike , and I like things that are sustainable and I really like things that help the planet , hence the wooden bicycle .

Pentagon 's number two suggests terror war will end in Oct. 2008
Michael Roston
Published : Wednesday February 28 , 2007 Print This Email This
The Department of Defense 's number two official appears to imply in a memo that the Global War on Terrorism will end just in time for the presidential election in November 2008 .
The contents of the document are outlined in a column in today 's Washington Post .
Al Kamen , who writes the Post 's " In The Loop " column , cited a pair of memos written by Deputy Secretary of Defense Gordon England in today 's paper .
The first memo was written Dec. 6 and sent to top military and civilian officials .
It identifies eight priorities for the coming fiscal year , and the first of them is to " Win the Global War on Terrorism . "
In a second memo from Feb. 15 , England writes that " to ensure that warfighters and taxpayers receive maximum benefit from on - going initiatives , it would be highly desirable to complete current projects by the summer / fall of 2008 . "
England then provides a quarterly grid with the same eight priorities from the December memo and " expected milestone conclusion dates " for each one .
As Kamen points out , the first priority of winning the global terror war from the earlier memo is included on the grid , and " looks to be over around October 2008 . "
The next presidential election will occur in November 2008 , a month later .
Kamen 's full column can be accessed at the Washington Post 's website .

Cyrus the Great Link To Us CYRUS THE GREAT AND THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH The Truth Behind Spiegel 's Article The Truth Behind Christmas The Truth Behind ‘ 300 ’ Home | THE TRUTH BEHIND ‘300 ’
Spenta Productions | THE TRUTH BEHIND ‘300 ’
For many Iranians the cinematic movie ' 300 ' may come as a shocking revelation .
But to those of us who came up through America 's school system , the ' Battle of Thermopylae , ' which is what the movie ' 300 ' is based on , is as familiar as George Washington 's fabled " cherry tree " episode .
The Battle of Thermopylae was of course written by the classical Greek author , Herodotus , who lived in the Persian city of Halicarnassus .
His book , ' The Histories ' became part of Western folklore only recently .
It was not until about 1850 that America embraced Herodotus as the leading authority on Persian history .
Before 1850 , however , the West had a very favorable impression of the Persian Empire .
That 's because the West 's main source for Persian history was the Bible and the ' Cyropaedia , ' written by another Greek author named Xenophon .
But the Cyropaedia glorified the monarchy of Cyrus The Great , and in the wake of two bloody revolutions fought by America and France to liberate themselves from their own monarchies , a major campaign began , around the mid 19th century , to promote democracy throughout the rest of Europe , and Herodotus was the perfect propaganda tool .
Herodotus was a democratic groupie and was quickly ushered in as the " Father Of History . "
Around 1850 , his ' Battle Of Thermopylae ' came to symbolize the West 's struggle for democracy against the powerful forces of Persia 's monarchy .
The story is easy to buy into : 300 brave Spartans saved Western democracy from 2.7 million evil Persians .
But aside from the fanciful numbers which need decimal - point adjustments , this whimsical tale has far graver consequences than a mere biased account of history .
The ' Battle Of Thermopylae ' has been the single most powerful wedge , which has divided East and West for over 2 millennia .
In a time when East and West should be reconciling their differences , along comes the movie ' 300 ' to drive that wedge even deeper .
What is most disturbing about this movie is not that it lacks historical accuracy .
It is not that Xerxes , the Grandson of Cyrus The Great and loving husband of Esther , is shown as an oversized drag queen .
It is not even the outdated racist cliché of casting the Persians as Africans and the Spartans as white , blue - eyed ' Chippendale dancers , ' when in reality the roles may well have been reversed .
What is so distressing about this movie is the realization of the tremendous power Hollywood wields in determining a people 's identity .
It is the same nightmare Native Americans endured during the whole ' cowboy - movie ' genre .
But for those who are quick to dismiss ' 300 ' as a fleeting fantasy flick aimed at the insignificant , 17 to 24 year - old male video - gamer , think again .
First there was Alexander , now ' 300 , ' next could well be the ' Battle Of Marathon , ' another one of Herodotus 's glowing accounts of ancient Persia .
Herodotus is accepted blindly by virtually all Western demographics .
Even the New York Times is not immune .
Here is how it described the Persians in its April 20 , 2004 issue about the Battle Of Marathon :
" the defeat of a ruthless state ( Persia ) that had enslaved much of the known world from the Balkans to the Himalayas . "
- William J. Broad ,
( NY Times )
" the ancient Greeks defeated the Asian invaders ( Persia ) and saved Europe in what scholars call one of the first great victories of freedom over tyranny " - William J. Broad ,
( NY Times )
What stretches the limits of hypocrisy is that there is n't a single shred of archeological evidence that the Persians ever owned slaves .
Yet we know that slavery was an integral cornerstone of Greek society .
Aristotle 's manifesto even sanctions it .
Persia , which was once a haven for runaway slaves from Egypt , Greece , and later Rome , is today branded as a slave - hungry empire by cultures which were built on slavery !
What makes Herodotus 's propaganda so difficult to refute is that it is peppered with facts .
But in reality , it is a desperate diatribe .
Perhaps his biggest ploy is his attempt to equate democracy with freedom .
These two words are used virtually interchangeably throughout his book .
And the West has swallowed it hook - line - and - sinker .
But America 's founding fathers knew better .
They implemented many safeguards to protect freedom from the pitfalls that mired Athenian democracy .
Even Winston Churchill said , " Democracy is the worst form of government except for all the others which have been tried . "
Democracy may well be the best form of government .
But what makes America great is not so much democracy , as it is its Bill Of Rights .
And this is exactly what made Persia Great .
Democracy can often lead to tyranny by the majority as was the case in democratic Athens , where women , slaves and foreigners did not have the right to vote .
In monarchic Persia , however , women enjoyed a level of gender equality unmatched even to this day , and slavery was not practiced .
The fact is , Persia 's monarchy was more free than Athens ' democracy , all because of Persia 's Bill Of Rights .
No one exemplifies Persia 's freedom better than Herodotus himself .
He describes Athens as the bastion of freedom , yet he chose to live in Persia .
Xenophon , on the other hand , who actually lived in Athens , reminisces enviously about the monarchy of Cyrus The Great .
Herodotus claims Persia had enslaved most of the known world , yet we know Herodotus was not a slave .
He traveled freely throughout the empire , openly criticizing it .
Why did Herodotus not live in Greece ?
Because Persia - the empire he is so quick to demonize - afforded him the very freedom to publish his scathing report of it .
People want to live where their god - given rights are protected , regardless of whether its democratic or monarchic .
These god - given rights were first drafted into law by the founder of the Persian empire , Cyrus The Great .
In fact , ancient Persia may well have served as the blue print for America 's Bill Of Rights .
Both Thomas Jefferson and James Madison , the architects of America 's Constitution , were great admirers and owned several copies of Xenophon 's Cyropaedia .
Today , no other country resembles ancient Persia as closely as does the United States .
If any country should sympathize with , rather than celebrate , Persia 's quagmire in Greece , it is the United States .
Few events in history mirror America 's war on terror as closely as Persia 's war on Greece .
The Greeks had been carrying out terrorist attacks on Persian holdings for years .
They had attacked Persian cities , set fire to Persian temples , disrupted key trade routes , and pirated merchant ships crossing the Bosphorus .
They incited rebellions inside Persian provinces , but perhaps most abhorrent to the Persians was the ease by which the Greeks broke their treaties and betrayed Persia 's trust .
Rather than resort to violence , however , Persia tried to keep the Greeks in check by financially supporting Greek politicians who were " pro-Persian , " much the same way America fights its proxy wars .
But what finally triggered Persia 's wrath was an act rarely mentioned in the West , though well documented , even by Herodotus ( 7:11 ) .
Persia 's 9/11 :
In 498 BCE , Athens carried out a terrorist attack on Sardis , a major Persian city , which made 9/11 seem like child 's play .
Aristagoras , an Athenian , set fire to the " outlying parts " of Sardis trapping most of its population " in a ring of fire . "
( Herodotus 5:101 )
More innocent civilians died at the hands of Aristagoras than Osama bin Laden could ever hope to kill .
And just as most of the world supported America 's retaliation against Al Qaeda , so did it rally in support of Persia 's attack on Athens .
The Spartans were not even targets of Persia 's attack , until they violated a universal protocol by killing a Persian messenger who Herodotus claims was asking for Sparta 's submission but in reality was probably sent by Persia 's king , Xerxes to convey the same message America sent to the entire world after 9/11 : " you 're either with us , or against us . "
The Spartans were Greek Jihadists who lived only to die .
They were by all accounts ruthless savages who murdered Greek slaves known as " Helots " just for sport , cultivated a culture of thievery and rape , and practiced infanticide , as the movie ' 300 ' rightly points out in its opening scenes .
Sparta was not even democratic .
It was an oligarchy at best .
Despite knowing all this , the West continues to hail the Spartans as the saviors of Western democracy .
Yes , the Spartans died fighting a foreign invader .
But so do countless terrorists .
Yet few would consider them " good guys . "
Those who do are then not much different from Westerners who cheer for the Spartans .
Persia was drawn into a protracted war against terror , much the same way the U.S. was .
Cheering for the Spartans merely because they were underdogs , is like cheering for Osama bin Laden today .
The Power Of Film :
History is no longer written by the victors , it is written by filmmakers .
Most minority groups in America have come to realize this fact and are quick to bankroll films that communicate their stories to the rest of the world .
Perhaps the movie ' 300 ' was a necessary wake - up call for the Iranian / Persian community to support responsible filmmakers , who report history with honesty and integrity .
Alex Jovy 's epic movie about Cyrus The Great could have done wonders for the Iranian image ( www.chahayagroup.com).
But Alex Jovy 's movie today sits idle due lack of money .
My documentary film about Cyrus The Great has languished for a mere want of $ 400,000 ( www.spentaproductions.com/cyruspreview.htm).
Iranians are the most affluent minority group in America .
If they set their mind to it , they could set the historical record straight virtually overnight .
Until then , their history will be written by the likes of Zack Snyder .
Cyrus Kar In Search of Cyrus the Great
I Was working late in my D.C. office .
I ’d been running some new simulations on my macro- model , but nothing was converging , so I figured I ’d close up my spreadsheet and find a corner in some dark speak - easy to lick my wounds .
That ’s when she walked in .
She had a
neckline as low as the Nasdaq in ’01 , curves like sine waves and a dress tighter than the global oil supply .
She had my attention even before she pulled out two reports I ’d seen that very morning .
“ I ’m sorry to barge in on you like this , ” she said in a voice that gave my calculator a power surge .
“ I did n’t know where else to turn . ”
Advertisement
“ You came to the right place , doll , ” I said .
“ I see you ’ve got the first - quarter GDP report , along with the new compensation results . ”
I ’d been puzzling over these numbers all day , but what , I wondered , could this tall glass of ice water want with them ?
“ That ’s right , ” she purred .
“ I need to know why GDP is up 4.8 % , the strongest quarter since 2003 , yet real wages are falling . ”
Yeah , I thought , you and everybody else who works for a living .
“ Why the interest ? ” I shot back .
She did n’t look like a Democrat .
“ I wish I could tell you .
But I work for some powerful people ” -- now I knew she was n’t a Democrat -- “ and they ’d be very upset if they even knew I was here . ”
Advertisement
“ Why me ?
Why do n’t you ask your powerful friends to explain why the economy ’s racing ahead but leaving working stiffs behind ? ”
She got kinda sulky , and I kinda liked it .
“ They would n’t know where to look .
What ’s worse , most of them think it ’s great when wage growth decelerates because with no inflationary pressure from labor costs , it means the Fed can take a powder on rate increases . ”
“ Tell me about it , sister .
I ’ve been leaning on Bernanke for months on that point , but he does n’t return my calls . ”
Needless to say , I took the case .
I was n’t sure what game little Miss Conflicting Reports was playing , but I figured I ’d play along for now .
Advertisement
Fact is , I ’d been asking the same question myself .
Every quarter we seemed to be getting great news on top - line statistics -- GDP , productivity , profits -- yet the typical workers ’ real earnings were down 2 % over the recovery .
Guys like me do n’t like it when things line up that way .
I headed for the union hall , figuring some of those guys might have an angle .
Problem was , with private - sector unions down to 8 % of the workforce , the hall had become a Starbucks .
I got a vanilla chai latte to go and beat it .
I decided to head for the new economy , so I looked up some managers and professionals in the service sector .
I found them , all right , but they did n’t have any answers .
As of the first quarter of 2006 , their compensation had lagged inflation for three quarters running .
This was more serious than I ’d thought .
Whatever was driving a wedge between overall growth and living standards , it was reaching pretty high up the pay scale .
I was n’t sure what mess I ’d gotten into here , but it was time to confront the doll that got me into it .

I caught up with her in her penthouse , a place that had “ housing bubble ” written all over it .
I know my wealth distributions , and this kitten came from the top 0.1 % .
I do n’t like playing the sap -- it was time for some class warfare .
“ OK , gorgeous .
Drop the ‘ two Americas ’ line and give it to me straight .
You know as well as I do where the growth is going .
What ’s your game ? ”
She nibbled her lip and looked up at me real sweet .
“ I suppose if I told you I ’m just a girl who cares about the bottom 99 % , you would n’t believe me . ”
She supposed right .
Advertisement
“ All right , I ’ll come clean , ” she said , slumping in a chaise lounge that probably cost the average income of the bottom fifth .
“ I work for the Republican National Committee , and we ’re starting to get spooked by the president ’s poll numbers on the economy .
We figured if we do n’t get a little trickle - down soon , it could hurt us in 2006 , not to mention ’ 08 . ”
I kicked myself for not seeing it sooner .
“ So you do n’t give a damn about the structural factors driving the productivity / wage gap : the declining unions , low minimum wage , the profit squeeze , slack job creation and , most of all , the way globalization is sapping the bargaining clout of the American worker , blue and white collar alike . ”
“ Why should I ? ” she said , finally showing her true colors .
“ Any intervention would just cuff the invisible hand , doing more harm than good . ”
She was Milton Friedman with the body of Scarlett Johansson .
I had to get outta there .
“ You ’re wrong , ” I shouted , staggering toward the door .
“ You ca n’t see it , but these two reports are a microcosm of everything that ’s right and wrong with this economy .
Tell your people that whoever understands and articulates this disconnect , along with a convincing policy agenda to reconnect growth and living standards -- that ’s who wins the big tamale . ”

I was wasting my breath .
She had me bounced by a security guard as pumped - up as ExxonMobil ’s profits .
I brushed off the dust and headed for the office .
You ’d think a case like this would be dispiriting to a guy like me , but you ’d be wrong .
Sure , she made me mad , but I saw things clearly now , and her little scheme was about to backfire .
There ’s an electorate out there that ’s looking for some economic stewardship .
Maybe I ’m just one economist in this big , crazy city , and maybe the other guys got the deep pockets .
But the way I see it , we can shape our economic outcomes so that everyone gets a fair shake , not just the chosen few .
I opened up a spreadsheet and got to work .
MIT graduate student Timothy J. Buschman , left , and Professor Earl Miller of the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences have found concrete evidence that two radically different brain regions play different roles in the different modes of attention .
Credit : Donna Coveney
If you spotted an anaconda poised to strike , the signal to pay attention would originate in a different part of your brain than if you gazed at an anaconda in the zoo , neuroscientists at MIT 's Picower Institute for Learning and Memory report in the March 30 issue of Science .
The work , which could have implications for treating attention deficit disorder ( ADD ) , is the first concrete evidence that two radically different brain regions -- the prefrontal cortex and the parietal cortex -- play different roles in these different modes of attention .
What 's more , when you focus your attention , the electrical activity in these two brain areas synchronizes and oscillates at different frequencies .
" It 's as if the brain is using two different stops on the FM radio dial for different types of attention , " said study co-author Earl K. Miller , Picower Professor of Neuroscience .
Top to bottom
Brain signals related to the knowledge we have acquired about the world are called top - down .
Signals related to incoming sensory information are called bottom - up .
" Loud , flashy things like fire alarms automatically grab our attention , " Miller said .
" By contrast , we choose to pay attention to certain things we think are important .
We found two different modes of brain operation related to each , and they seem to originate in different parts of the brain .
Further , the automatic ( or bottom - up ) versus willful ( top - down ) modes of attention seem to rely on two different frequency channels in the brain , suggesting that the brain might communicate in different frequency bands for different types of signals . "
ADD involves being overly sensitive to the automatic attention - grabbers and less able to willfully sustain attention .
" Our work suggests that we should target different parts of the brain to try to fix different types of attention deficits , " Miller said .
" The downside of most psychiatic drugs is they are too broad , " he continued .
" It 's like hitting the problem with a sledgehammer ; you get the benefits but also many unintended consequences .
Our work suggests that we may one day be able to figure out what is the exact problem with each individual and specifically target those shortcomings .
And that is the ultimate goal in psychiatric intervention . "
To address the fact that neural activity from the prefrontal and parietal cortices had never been directly compared , Miller and co-author Timothy J. Buschman , an MIT graduate student in the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences , conducted a series of experiments in which monkeys were engaged in different kinds of tasks .
The researchers looked at activity in two areas of their brains simultaneously -- the prefrontal cortex , also called the brain 's executive because it is in charge of voluntary behavior , and the parietal cortex , which integrates sensory information coming from various parts of the body .
The monkeys had to pick out rectangles of certain colors and orientations on a video screen .
Some of the rectangles popped out at them like the anaconda in the forest ; others they had to search for .
The results support the idea that when something pops out at us , sensory cortical areas like the parietal cortex directs our eyes toward the stimulus .
When we purposefully look for something , the prefrontal cortex is doing the driving .
" Taken together , these data suggest two modes of operation :
When a stimulus pops out , a bottom - up , fast target selection occurs first in the posterior visual cortex ; while in search mode , a top - down , longer latency target selection is reflected first in the prefrontal cortex , " Miller said .
" To our knowledge , these are the first direct demonstrations that these areas may have different contributions to these different modes of attention . "

This is fascinating .
For one , they say , " No statements discussing the use or manner in which system passwords are used , constructed or stored . "

They are the same for all iVotronic machines in the country , and likely to be known to every election official who manages elections on an iVotronic machine .
They can never be changed , without changing the firmware on the iVotronic machine .
This represents poor practice . "
I 'll have a post in an hour or so on my blog about the extent to which the report actually " obeys " any of this .

" testing is to focus solely on whether or not ' code or logic exists in the software that would have directly and conclusively caused voter selections to not have been captured or to have been omitted ' " ... i'm no computer expert , but is it possible for the anomalous undervote rate to have been caused indirectly , through other code that was excluded from testing within the narrow dictates of the letter ?
because he clearly states that " Review of source code that is not involved in these functions is outside the bounds of this source code review . "
So that means there is additional source code , and would logically lead to questions about just what is contained in that OTHER source code , eh ?
And no one representing the state ( or writing the reports , or doing anything that has anything to do with ES&S ) is allowed to say or even infer that perhaps there might have been better ways to construct the code , or better security methods , or anything .
and he stipulates that there will be no questions about the physical security of the machines , or the conduct of the election procedures .
hmmm.... guess he heard about those " sleepovers " from the stories on Brad Blog .
gee --- reading this letter , one might think the ES&S vice president did n't have much faith in his product .

I do not consider myself a computer expert either .
But I did spend about ten years of my life as a software programmer .
Based on that experience and credentials , then , I 'd answer the question with a " yes , absolutely , beyond a shadow of a doubt " .
Many is the time that a problem I 'd created elsewhere in some unrelated routine in a program would cause an indirect , seemingly unrelated problem elsewhere .
That kind of bug is often the most difficult to troubleshoot .
The problem is then compounded when you 're dealing with the technical limitations , requirements and quirkiness of touch - screen hardware and the needs of its interface on top of the underlying main routines of the voting software routines themself .

Do n't you just love independent audits ?
All you need is to have paper ballots so that you can audit the machine count and everything will be fine , right ?
Remember , Democratic Pelosi swore in the Republican in the Sarasota case , and by the time it is investigated and litigated , his term will be over and he will have voted to send your kids off to commit war crimes , to tax you to enrich Halliburton , and against impeachment .
As Paul Lehto has stated repeatedly , you have to get it right the first time .
There is no possible redo of an election based on an audit .
The CA50 case involved op - scans which had paper ballots .
The result was exactly the same as in Sarasota where there was no paper ballot .
The Republican was sworn in and if anyone is ever able to prove that he was n't elected , he 'll be drawing a Congressional pension and wo n't give a hoot .
Hand - counted paper ballots at the precincts with full citizen oversight are n't perfect .
They can have up to a full 1 % error rate .
Other systems , including mechanical lever machines , DREs , punch cards , and optical - scans , have more than a 5 % error rate and sometimes as high as a 4,000 % error rate .
Since elections are often decided by less than 5 % of the total votes , do we really want to entrust them to systems that have a greater than 5 % error rate ?
I was told that Richard Stallman , the founder of the Free Software movement and a man whose knowledge of computers is greatly respected , was asked after a talk the other day about open source code in voting machines and he gave many examples of how it could be used to rig elections and concluded that computers have no place in elections .
If Stallman says that votes should be on paper , I doubt if there is anyone in the computing world with the authority to refute him and I can't think of anyone who commands more respect .
There is no such thing as an independent audit , and even if there were , it could never change the result of an election .
The election is over when the Secretary of State transmits the partial machine count to Congress , who can then swear in the " winner , " but an audit cannot even begin until all the votes have been counted .
What good is an audit of half an election ?
And nobody can request a recount until the election is certified , by which time the " winner " has redecorated their new office , hired their new staff , and voted for any bill that would continue to allow elections to be rigged .

Wow , Brad ! ~
Now it all makes perfect sense .
From the very beginning of this Freaky FRAUDIT , Kathy Dent , David Drury and other Officials have almost gleefully displayed their unsettling , one - sided love affair with ES&S .
In fact , during the Sarasota Recount in November , S.O.E.
Kathy Dent presented her fellow Canvassing Board Members with a CONTRACT from ES&S granting the e-voting software giant the role of " consultant " during the proceedings .
( Neither Board Member approved the contract , or signed it at that time . )
No wonder Dent and Drury are so torked !
They have to remember what NOT to say at ALL TIMES -- like localized , mini-Tony - Snows !
( Some Loyal Lickers they get , huh ?
Jeez , I hope they get big bucks for peddling that kind of soul - ripping stretch . )
All those creepy bullet points tell me WHY they side - stepped every question , sweating and swallowing and stuttering through every press conference ; why they denied emphatically it could ever be the machines despite so much evidence to the contrary ; why they consistantly met the voter 's legitimate concerns with hostile aggression / condescension .
They even stooped so low as to blame them by invoking their old and tired " voter confusion " mantra , parroted over and over again by their henchmen as the official cause for a massive undervote that altered the outcome of a national election and that , we now know , THEY CAUSED .
Shame .
Grotesque , debilitating shame on Florida .
Again .
( It 's a three - peat ! )
Another fun fact for your consideration : A National USA TODAY
Poll taken 2 weeks prior to the 2006 Elections put Congressional Democratic Candidates in 50 - 50 districts ahead by 13 % .
Sarasota is a 50 - 50 district .
The undervote rate came it at 14.9 % .
In the ONE county Jennings would have won , as experts from both sides have testified under oath .
I was wondering : could n't they have micro-targeted Sarsota and determined with some precision exactly how many undervotes it would take to swing the election ?
And as Election Defense Alliance Co-Founder Jonathan Simon has astutely pointed out , the Republicans did n't have time to adjust the PBE 's for so many late October surprises that worked against them for once , ( i.e. Foley and Haggert ) ...?
Anyone ?... What woud you all suggest we do to get rid of Dent ?
Her resignation is long overdue !
Thank you , Brad , for keeping me abreast of my little County 's corruption from clear across the country .
Very nice of you !
Sincerely ,
Jeannie Dean

You people are one of two things kool - aid drinking liberals or love to spread assine conspiracy theories .
These machines only accounted for 20 % of all the votes cast in Florida .
Stop dreaming and whining Christine Jennings and Vern ran horrible nasty campaigns and people rejected both of them .
The undervotes only happened in that race because people did n't feel either candidate was worthy of their vote in a mostly republican district .

AlanS - I 've warned you before and I 'm doing it now again .

1 ) Do NOT personally attack other commenters .
2 ) Do not post knowing disinformation .
You are walking the line on both counts above .
And in case # 2 was n't " knowing " for you , I 'll say it again for you :
The 15 % undervote rate was on Sarasota 's touch - screen DRE systems only .
The undervote rate for the same race in the same county on paper absentee ballots was a normal 2.5 % .
Similarly , the undervote rate was the same normal rate in other counties in the FL - 13 race .
All of which blows your kool - aid drinking kook theory that 15 % of the voters only in Sarasota and only when voting at the polls , did n't like that " horrible nasty campaign " .
Now you know ( as if you did n't before ) .
Do it again and you are gone for good .

Computer / electronic voting is MADE TO ORDER FOR FRAUD by anyone wishing to manipulate it .
It is the vulnerable nature of that technology which makes it so .
Today 's technology for Computer / electronic voting should NOT be used .
It is far better to use simple paper balloting than fall prey to the FRAUD - PRONE digital systems offered by companies making a killing on tax - payer monies , in addition to killing off confidence in the U.S. voting process .

This letter is of the type written by those at the top of the growing conspiracy to corrupt the '08 election .
The uppresidented plan is being managed by Rove in and at the White House .
It includes Attorneygate as a means of placing operatives in key states to corrupt the election by thwarting democratic activity and voting thru bad prosecutions of democratic voters and candidates .
The person who actually hired the current White House Counsel does not like what he sees :
One further disclosure : I have never been an advocate of executive privilege , except as it might relate to the most sensitive national security information .
To the contrary , you show me a White House aide who does not want his conversations and advice to the president revealed , and I will show you someone who should not be talking with or advising a president .

Brad ( in re # 11 ) : I want to commend you for your handling of this situation .
I have long believed that those who manage and control liberal blogs must be as " strict " as those who control the right - wing nutjob blogs where anybody who questions the dominant paridigm ( even with facts and solid links ) is immediately banned .
Wing - nuts have the whole mainstream media to carry their water --- we must protect our discussion from those who would subvert them with mis-direction and diffusion .
Honest discussion is one thing ( such as , should this criminal cabal in the White House be shot for treason or just jailed for life ) but trolling and / or trying to plant false memes is not acceptible and should not be allowed in the name of any false concept of " free speech " that they wo n't give us .

I attempted to re-read the SAIT report and compare the list of limitations to the report text ( see this post ) .
Short version : it does n't seem like the report authors thought much of this list of limitations in the writing of their report .
I 'd be surprised if this letter was the last one that was exchanged between ES&S and Drury ; that is , I bet this list was unacceptable or non-binding or something ( or ES&S felt that fighting the final report would have weakened their position ) .

I hear ya .
I wonder how these people can commit such atrocious acts and not think anything is wrong with it .
Is it corruption ?
We 've all seen good examples of that in Florida .
It seems to make for a perfect relationship between business and government .
When government gets corrupted and no longer performs oversight on the private sector , the private sector then gets to run wild , and the two become fast friends .
There is no gatekeeper between the two .
Very bad !
This seems to be the perfect example of why business oversight is needed .
Then you add in the whole authoritarian ideology thing and it gets even more confusing .
I think that this part of the equation is what really makes these people so amazingly blind to the rule of law .
They think that they are doing the right thing so why should those pesky laws matter ?

An official with Election Systems & Software inspected 31 Luzerne County voting machines Tuesday and concluded they were programmed and calibrated properly .

The touch - screen machines were set aside after the Nov. 7 election in response to complaints that a voter choices were flipped to unintended candidates on the screen .
“ Vote flipping — there is no such thing as that , ” said Willie “ Wes ” Wesley Jr. , a regional accounts manager with Nebraska - based ES&S .
“ It ’s really a calibration issue . ”

Do you work with and educational outlet that studies this matter ?
I do n’t recall seeing you at the test .
The test was conducted in full view of the press and public in a sterile environment to simply check calibration .

... Mark D. said on 3/26/2007 @ 8:14 am PT ...
The simplest solution to please the computer
voting companies in bed with Republicans &
those seeking honest results is this ...
1 ) Have all ballots be touch screen .
2 ) Have that touch screen produce a receipt
the voter can verify is correct , regardless
of errors on the screen , before turning in .
3 ) Have it go through a scanner that reads
its barcode , which then puts it in storage
for a hand count .
Yes - hand count in every
place .
What do you get out of all of this ?
4 ) 2 immediate results , one that takes ( a
hand count ) a few days .
This eliminates a
need to ever have a recount , it 's already
done at the time of the vote .
If one of
the 3 is far worse , then it will show
itself as tampered with consistently
& easily , so the right - wing folks in
cahoots with the companies to fix an
election will no longer have power ...
5 ) To get there best , this one machine should
be fully designed by independent & non-party
driven organizations , with full approval by
the public / Washington DC & the Supreme
Court if need be , while they finally pass
a law saying " Americans have a right
to vote " , and eliminate the electoral
college & private election financing
so not only the rich / connected can
have a chance to vote & win also .
6 ) Hand counters are 50/50 major party split .
They can can't after regular 1st shift hours ,
so it need n't be just elderly folks who have
time in the day to spare , or can't do it as
well ( no offense ) .
It 's okay if one is not
perfect of the three or tampered , another
will reveal its error , and it would be
virtually impossible to equally mess
up all three to avoid being caught .
7 ) Fix the problem at the source .
Simplify the
process to one way to vote nationwide , that 's
able to give the ' final answer ' a few days
later .
Yes , absentee ballots will only be
written in , but since hand counts have a
lower rate of error and if done on the
correct form , can be scanned , it nets
another layer of safety for everyone .
8 ) Same for overseas ballots ... again ,
anyone who mentions those as why this
ca n't work should remember , those are
not the primary source of tamperings
that denied Kerry & Gore presidency ,
and the many other illegal activities .
9 ) Brad , if you like this idea , share it .
I 'm an idealist in this view ( not always )
and it may seem far fetched , but we may
not have a more complete solution .
If
the Constitutional Right part and the
Electoral College part wo n't get fixed
- that 's fine , the big thing is to get
the vote process fixed primarily ...
10 ) Oh , and to fix unfair voter rolls
being purged & other such preliminary
acts , have more federal oversight by
non-partisan people .
They , they extra
election workers , they 'll cost money ,
but its a price worth paying and if it
pays , they 'll find folks to do it too .
