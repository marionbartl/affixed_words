Over the 27 years between 1979 and 2005 some areas of the tropics experienced an increase in rainfall of as much as 0.5 millimeters per day per decade ( red areas ) .
Overall , tropical rainfall increased 5 percent during this period .
Scientists had predicted that global warming ought to increase rainfall in the tropics .
Now NASA researchers say it has .
Scientists assembled a 27 - year global record of rainfall from satellite observations and ground - based instruments and found that the rainiest years between 1979 and 2005 occurred primarily after 2001 .
The wettest year in the record was 2005 , followed by 2004 , 2003 , 2002 and 1998 .
The patterns observed in the record showed that increases in rainfall were concentrated over tropical oceans , while there was a slight decrease over land .
" When we look at the whole planet over almost three decades , the total amount of rain falling has changed very little , " said study leader Guojun Gu of NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Md. " But in the tropics , where nearly two - thirds of all rain falls , there has been an increase of 5 percent . "
This increase in rainfall is expected in a warming world , because warmer surface temperatures increase the evaporation of water from the ocean and the land and warmer air can hold more moisture , which eventually forms clouds and precipitation .
" A warming climate is the most plausible cause of this observed trend in tropical rainfall , " said study team member Robert F. Adler , also of Goddard .
Evidence for the trend is still being gathered , Adler says .
The latest numbers for 2006 show that it tied 2005 as the rainiest year in the record .
The results of the study are detailed in the Aug. 1 issue of the Journal of Climate .
White House blocking congressional Plame probe , chairman says Nick Juliano
Published : Monday December 3 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This President Bush is doing everything possible to delay , obfuscate and obstruct a congressional investigation of his possible role in exposing an undercover CIA agent , a Congressional chairman alleges .
Rep. Henry Waxman , chair of the House Oversight Committee , has challenged new Attorney General Michael Mukasey to demonstrate his independence from the White House , just as Clinton - era AG Janet Reno did in handing over documents related to the president and vice president .
The California Democrat is asking for Mukasey 's help in obtaining records of special prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald 's interviews with Bush , Cheney and other senior administration officials regarding the unmasking of former CIA operative Valerie Plame Wilson .
Former administration spokesman Scott McClellan recently revealed that Bush and Cheney were among those " involved " in his passing along " false information " regarding the Plame scandal , making the committee 's inquiry that much more pressing , Waxman says .
" I recognize that President Bush and his counsel may not want this information provided to Congress .
But the role of the Attorney General is to administer the laws with impartiality , " Waxman wrote Monday in a letter to Mukasey .
" The Justice Department provided the exact same information to Congress during the Clinton Administration .
There is no special standard for President Bush that exempts him and his senior advisors from responsible congressional oversight . "
Waxman charged that the White House is blocking Fitzgerald from handing over copies of interview reports dealing with certain White House officials , especially Bush and Cheney , although he has handed over copies of reports on other administration officials , including CIA officers and State Department employees .
" There is no legitimate basis for the withholding of these documents .
Mr. Fitzgerald has apparently determined that these documents can be produced to the Committee without infringing on his prosecutorial independence or violating the rules of grand jury secrecy , " Waxman wrote .
" As records of statements made by White House officials to federal investigators , outside the framework of presidential decision - making , the documents could not be subject to a valid claim of executive privilege . "
The chairman notes that Janet Reno , who was attorney general in the Clinton administration , made an independent judgement to provide several FBI interview reports to the committee , including those of Bill Clinton and then - Vice President Al Gore .
Waxman 's committee has spent months investigating Plame 's exposure ; he invited the outed spy and others to testify in March and requested copies of interview reports with Bush , Cheney , McClellan , chief of staff Andrew Card , political adviser Karl Rove and others in July .
Emptywheel notes the narrow parameters of Waxman 's request should spare him from secrecy concerns that would permanently delay his ability to get ahold of the records he wants .
" Understand the scope of this , " Emptywheel writes .
" As Waxman explains , he 's only asking for details of interviews not conducted in front of the grand jury .
Anything conducted in front of the grand jury is protected by grand jury secrecy ; anything before that ( like early FBI interviews ) or not conducted before the grand jury ( like Dick and Bush 's interviews in June 2004 , after both had lawyered up ) is " fair game . "
There 's a delicious irony in this last bit , since it means that the deference Fitz showed to Bush and Dick - - by letting them avoid the stress of a grand jury appearance -- is precisely what would make their interview transcripts accessible here . "
Hundreds of U.S. diplomats Wednesday vented anger and frustration over the State Department ’s decision to force Foreign Service officers to take jobs in Iraq , with some calling it a “ potential death sentence . ”
In a contentious hourlong meeting , they peppered officials with often hostile comments about the move announced last week that will require some diplomats -- under threat of dismissal -- to serve at the embassy in Baghdad and in reconstruction teams in outlying provinces .
Many expressed serious concern about the ethics of sending diplomats against their will to work in a war zone -- where the embassy staff is largely confined to Baghdad ’s protected Green Zone -- as the department reviews use of private security guards to protect its staff .
“ Incoming is coming in every day ; rockets are hitting the Green Zone , ” said Jack Croddy , a senior foreign service officer .

He and others confronted Foreign Service Director General Harry Thomas , who approved the move to “ directed assignments ” to deal with a shortage of volunteers .
“ It ’s one thing if someone believes in what ’s going on over there and volunteers , but it ’s another thing to send someone over there on a forced assignment , ” Croddy said .
“ I ’m sorry , but basically that ’s a potential death sentence and you know it .
Who will raise our children if we are dead or seriously wounded ? ”
No U.S. diplomats have been killed in Iraq , but the security situation is precarious .
Croddy ’s remarks were met with loud and sustained applause from the estimated 300 people at the meeting .
Thomas said the comments were “ filled with inaccuracies . ”

Secretary of State Condoleezza
Rice was not present , but her top advisor on Iraq , David Satterfield , attended .
State Department spokesman Sean McCormack acknowledged the session was “ pretty emotional . ”
He praised Thomas for holding the meeting , and he emphasized that all diplomats sign an oath to serve , obligating them to work anywhere .
George Bush and Gordon Brown are right : there should be no nuclear weapons in the Middle East .
The risk of a nuclear conflagration could be greater there than anywhere else .
Any nation developing them should expect a firm diplomatic response .
So when will they impose sanctions on Israel ?
Like them , I believe that Iran is trying to acquire the bomb .
I also believe it should be discouraged , by a combination of economic pressure and bribery , from doing so ( a military response would , of course , be disastrous ) .
I believe that Bush and Brown - who maintain their nuclear arsenals in defiance of the non-proliferation treaty - are in no position to lecture anyone else .
But if , as Bush claims , the proliferation of such weapons " would be a dangerous threat to world peace " , why does neither man mention the fact that Israel , according to a secret briefing by the US Defence Intelligence Agency , possesses between 60 and 80 of them ?
Officially , the Israeli government maintains a position of " nuclear ambiguity " : neither confirming nor denying its possession of nuclear weapons .
But everyone who has studied the issue knows that this is a formula with a simple purpose : to give the United States an excuse to keep breaking its own laws , which forbid it to grant aid to a country with unauthorised weapons of mass destruction .
The fiction of ambiguity is fiercely guarded .
In 1986 , when the nuclear technician Mordechai Vanunu handed photographs of Israel 's bomb factory to the Sunday Times , he was lured from Britain to Rome , drugged and kidnapped by Mossad agents , tried in secret , and sentenced to 18 years in prison .
He served 12 of them in solitary confinement and was banged up again - for six months - soon after he was released .
However , in December last year , the Israeli prime minister , Ehud Olmert , accidentally let slip that Israel , like " America , France and Russia " , had nuclear weapons .
Opposition politicians were furious .
They attacked Olmert for " a lack of caution bordering on irresponsibility " .
But US aid continues to flow without impediment .
As the fascinating papers released last year by the National Security Archive show , the US government was aware in 1968 that Israel was developing a nuclear device ( what it did n't know is that the first one had already been built by then ) .
The contrast to the efforts now being made to prevent Iran from acquiring the bomb could scarcely be starker .
At first , US diplomats urged Washington to make its sale of 50 F4 Phantom jets conditional on Israel 's abandonment of its nuclear programme .
As a note sent from the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs to the secretary of state in October 1968 reveals , the order would make the US " the principal supplier of Israel 's military needs " for the first time .
In return , it should require " commitments that would make it more difficult for Israel to take the critical decision to go nuclear " .
Such pressure , the memo suggested , was urgently required : France had just delivered the first of a consignment of medium range missiles , and Israel intended to equip them with nuclear warheads .
Twenty days later , on November 4 1968 , when the assistant defence secretary met Yitzhak Rabin ( then the Israeli ambassador to Washington ) , Rabin " did not dispute in any way our information on Israel 's nuclear or missile capability " .
He simply refused to discuss it .
Four days after that , Rabin announced that the proposal was " completely unacceptable to us " .
On November 27 , Lyndon Johnson 's administration accepted Israel 's assurance that " it will not be the first power in the Middle East to introduce nuclear weapons " .
As the memos show , US officials knew that this assurance had been broken even before it was made .
A record of a phone conversation between Henry Kissinger and another official in July 1969 reveals that Richard Nixon was " very leery of cutting off the Phantoms " , despite Israel 's blatant disregard of the agreement .
The deal went ahead , and from then on the US administration sought to bamboozle its own officials in order to defend Israel 's lie .
In August 1969 , US officials were sent to " inspect " Israel 's Dimona nuclear plant .
But a memo from the state department reveals that " the US government is not prepared to support a ' real ' inspection effort in which the team members can feel authorised to ask directly pertinent questions and / or insist on being allowed to look at records , logs , materials and the like .
The team has in many subtle ways been cautioned to avoid controversy , ' be gentlemen ' and not take issue with the obvious will of the hosts " .
Nixon refused to pass the minutes of the conversation he'd had with the Israeli prime minister , Golda Meir , to the US ambassador to Israel , Wally Barbour .
Meir and Nixon appear to have agreed that the Israeli programme could go ahead , as long as it was kept secret .
The US government has continued to protect it .
Every six months , the intelligence agencies provide Congress with a report on technology acquired by foreign states that 's " useful for the development or production of weapons of mass destruction " .
These reports discuss the programmes in India , Pakistan , North Korea , Iran and other nations , but not in Israel .
Whenever other states have tried to press Israel to join the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , the US and European governments have blocked them .
Israel has also exempted itself from the biological and chemical weapons conventions .
By refusing to sign these treaties , Israel ensures it needs never be inspected .
While the International Atomic Energy Agency 's inspectors crawl round Iran 's factories , put seals on its uranium tanks and blow the whistle when it fails to cooperate , they have no legal authority to inspect facilities in Israel .
So when the Israeli government complains , as it did last week , that the head of the IAEA is " sticking his head in the sand over Iran 's nuclear programme " , you can only gape at its chutzpah .
Israel is constantly racking up the pressure for action against Iran , aware that no powerful state will press for action against Israel .
Yes , Iran under Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is a dangerous and unpredictable state involved in acts of terror abroad .
The president is a Holocaust denier opposed to the existence of Israel .
During the Iran - Iraq war , Iran responded to Saddam Hussein 's toxic bombardments with chemical weapons of its own .
But Israel under Olmert is also a dangerous and unpredictable state involved in acts of terror abroad .
Two months ago it bombed a site in Syria ( whose function is fiercely disputed ) .
Last year , it launched a war of aggression against Lebanon .
It remains in occupation of Palestinian lands .
In February 2001 , according to the BBC , it used chemical weapons in Gaza : 180 people were admitted to hospital with severe convulsions .
Nuclear weapons in Israel 's hands are surely just as dangerous as nuclear weapons in Iran's .
So when will our governments speak up ?
When will they acknowledge that there is already a nuclear power in the Middle East , and that it presents an existential threat to its neighbours ?
When will they admit that Iran is not starting a nuclear arms race , but joining one ?
When will they demand that the rules they impose on Iran should also apply to Israel ?

Q. Are roadblocks legal ?
A . The US Supreme Court has found roadblocks to be legal for a variety of purposes , the most prominent being so - called “ sobriety check points . ”
There is a longer history of roadblock approvals related to checking vehicles near or at national border crossings .
However , many state courts take a less favorable view of roadblocks based on language in their respective state constitutions .
Probably the best example of this is the Michigan case that went to the US Supreme Court , Sitz vs. Michigan , that established the legal precedent for DWI roadblocks .
While the US Supreme Court found DWI roadblocks constitutional under the US Constitution , the case went back to Michigan and the State Supreme court found DWI roadblocks to be in violation of the state ’s constitution , and that decision takes precedent , in Michigan , over the decision of the US Supreme Court .
Q . Do I have to answer the questions posed to me at a roadblock ?
A . You do not have to answer any questions , particularly questions that would be self - incriminating .
You may be required ( forced by threat of arrest ) to show your drivers license , vehicle registration , and proof of insurance , if the state requires these items to be present in your vehicle .
However , you cannot be compelled to explain your travel plans , divulge the contents of your vehicle , or in any other way converse with law enforcement officers operating a roadblock .
You can be polite and courteous to the extent of providing the documents you are required to produce .
Beyond that , decline to answer any other questions you are asked .
In response to a potentially invasive question you can say something like ; “ Officer , I know you have your job to do , but I do not approve of roadblocks and I do not wish to have a conversation .
I realize I can be required to show you my driver ’s license .
Would you like to see my drivers license ? ”
End of discussion .
Q. Can they search my car ?
A . Your car can only be searched under the following circumstances :
You voluntarily give the police permission to search your vehicle .
The Police have a warrant to search your vehicle .
The police have “ probable cause ” or “ reasonable suspicion ” based on a reasonable explanation of why they believe you have illegal items in your vehicle .
They must be able to explain what they think they will find and why they think said items are in your vehicle .
If the police use their authority or force to search your vehicle , against your will , and they do not have a warrant or reasonable suspicion to conduct a search they can be ( and should be ) held criminally and civilly liable for conducting an illegal search .
This holds true even if the search reveals the possession of illegal items .
Q. How long can they keep me at a roadblock ?
A . One of the consistent rationalizations for roadblocks is that they are minimally intrusive and minimally inconvenient to the motorist .
For reasons that escape specific justification the courts seem to find 15 to 20 minutes the maximum amount of time a motorist can be detained by police before the police take formal action against the motorist or allow the motorist to leave .
However , the courts have placed the burden of forcing the issue upon the motorist .
If the motorist does not specifically request to leave , the police can successfully claim the motorist voluntarily remained under their control .
Therefore , if the police seem inclined to delay your departure , after they have checked your papers , specifically ask if you may now leave .
If they say “ no ” you are within your rights to ask for a legitimate explanation for your delay .
If no legitimate explanation is forthcoming you should persist in asking if you may leave .
There should be no confusion regarding your intentions and the fact that you are not willingly remaining within control of the police officers .
Q. Can I turn around or turn off to avoid a roadblock ?
A . In theory you are allowed to make any legal maneuver , even a U - turn to avoid a roadblock .
In reality , the police operating roadblocks deliberately locate them so it is almost impossible to legally avoid them once you become aware of their presence .
It is also common practice to hold a patrol car in reserve for the specific purpose of harassing motorists who overtly avoid a roadblock .
The National Motorists Association opposes the use of roadblocks , period .
The only justification for stopping citizens under a roadblock scenario is to warn them of an unseen peril that could cause injury or death to an unsuspecting motorist .
So - called “ sobriety check points , ” or seat belt checks , or the myriad of other excuses the government concocts to harass and intimidate its citizens through the use of roadblocks are , in our opinion unconstitutional and in direct contradiction to any honest definition of freedom .
Analysis : Egypt sees another war on terror
by Shaun Waterman
Cairo ( UPI ) Nov 9 , 2007
The leaders of Egypt , one of the key U.S. allies in its war on terrorism , see that conflict in a very different way than U.S. policymakers do .
U.S. officials have repeatedly talked about a historic ideological struggle , lasting a generation or more ; a " war of ideas , " pitting the supporters of freedom against its enemies -- violent extremists claiming to act in the name of Islam .
Egyptian officials , speaking this week at a forum for foreign observers attending the convention of the country 's ruling National Democratic Party , see the conflict very differently .
One of the NDP 's leaders , Gamal Mubarak , the son of and possible successor to Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak , said the " root cause " of the region 's problems with violent Islamic extremists was the Palestinian issue .
" You can not just belittle the main cause , " he said , " the deep feelings of injustice and humiliation ( among Arabs ) caused by Israel 's treatment of the Palestinians . "
If you neglect that , he said " no matter what you 're doing , you 're basically feeding the extremists . "
Mubarak charged the United States had made a " strategic mistake " after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terror attacks in New York and Washington .
" They jumped to the single - minded conclusion " that promoting democracy by toppling Saddam Hussein in Iraq was the way to defeat the extremists , he said .
He praised the recent U.S. push to restart the Israeli - Palestinian peace process as " going back to basics , to the root causes , " but questioned whether , after what he called seven " wasted " years , it had come too late .
" At the beginning of next year , the American political system will go off - track with campaigning ( for congressional and presidential elections ) and so on , " he said .
The deep - seated conviction that the unresolved Palestinian issue fuels Islamic extremism in the Arab world is not the only way that Cairo 's view of the problem differs from Washington's .
" This is a two - tier battle , " said Egyptian Finance Minister Youssef Boutros Ghali .
" There is an ideological dimension . ��
But the more important one is at the level of economics .
�� Poverty tends to push people towards extremism . "
The Egyptian government , he said , approached the issue as " essentially an economic one , " and the solution was " to empower the sectors of society that are most vulnerable " to recruitment by extremists , who " offer comforting �� simplistic solutions . "
" At the root " of the problem was " a sentiment of alienation , a sentiment of marginalization " among people who " feel they have no future " because of their exclusion from the benefits of the globalized world economy .
In turning the focus on the large numbers of Egyptians who have failed to benefit from the country 's recent 7 percent growth rate , Boutros Ghali was echoing one of the party 's convention talking points .
Official after official called for a continuation of the halting economic liberalization the party has embarked upon , with the prime minister launching a debate about doing away with the country 's subsidy program for bread , baby milk and other basic products .
But strong growth and spiraling foreign investment have not improved the daily lot of most Egyptians , many of whom have lost out as stagnating public sector wages fall behind the rising cost of living .
It is the rising unrest about this situation -- expressed over the summer in a wave of strikes and protests -- that officials fear extremists might be able to exploit .
" Perhaps it 's because I 'm an economist , " Boutros Ghali acknowledged .
" I tend to see everything in economic terms . "
Terrorism experts in the United States tend to dismiss suggestions that Islamic terrorism is driven by economics , pointing out that -- outside the so - called insurgency theaters , like Iraq , Palestine and Chechnya -- most Islamic terror attacks have been carried out by educated individuals from relatively comfortable middle - class backgrounds .
In part , the different ways the issue is seen in Cairo and Washington reflect divergent perceptions of the threat .
U.S. policymakers fret about small numbers of dedicated individuals , such as al - Qaida cells , bent on staging mass - casualty terror attacks .
Given the spread of the skills required to build , for instance , big truck bombs , and the inherent difficulty of preventing determined suicide attackers , some U.S. counter - terrorism specialists have concluded that the only way to defeat such groups is to de-legitimize them ; to isolate them from their neighbors and co-religionists .
For its part , the Egyptian government sees itself facing a very different kind of challenge -- one from a politicized Islamic movement called the Muslim Brotherhood .
Illegal for more than half a century , the brotherhood nevertheless remains one of the most widely supported opposition groups in Egypt .
Members are subject to arrest and detention without trial under Egypt 's 26 - year - old state of emergency , in which human - rights groups say torture is endemic .
Local news reports this week cited a brotherhood spokesman as saying that 79 members were currently under such detention .
But the government has walked a fine line with the movement .
Banned from standing in elections by a constitutional prohibition on political parties that organize on a religious basis , the brotherhood still controls about a fifth of the seats in Egypt 's Parliament , won in recent elections by nominally independent candidates , universally understood to be associated with the movement .
Critics say the grip on power the National Democratic Party has maintained over the years has strengthened the hand of the brotherhood , because Islamic institutions -- unlike unions of other parties -- could not be closed down or taken over .
" We have an absence of political freedom in Egypt that has pushed people into the arms of the Muslim Brotherhood , " said veteran observer Ahmed Abushadi , a former diplomat and member of the Egyptian Council for Foreign Affairs .
He said more liberal and secular Egyptians distrust the brotherhood , a group that eschews violence but advocates the establishment of an Islamic state , ruled by Shariah law .
But he said the brotherhood were not extremists .
Nevertheless , Egyptian officials maintain the specter of political Islam is " very dangerous , " in the words of Trade Minister Mohamed Rasheed Mohamed .
" We cannot allow political parties to start differentiating ( between Egyptians ) on the basis of belief , " he said .
" We have seen the results of that " elsewhere in the region .
Other disagree .
" The problem is not Islamism , it is lack of democracy , " said Osama el - Razali Harb , the vice president of one of Egypt 's small liberal parties .
Police in India wrongfully arrested and detained a Bangalore man for 50 days after internet service provider Airtel mis-identified him as the person who posted images on Orkut that insulted a revered historical figure .
Lakshmana Kailash K. , a 26 - year - old techie , was arrested at his home on August 31 and transported to Pune , more than 10 hours away , according to news reports .
He was held for 50 days and was released three weeks after police claimed to have apprehended the real people responsible for the posting .
Lakshmana 's saga started after someone posted unflattering images of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj , who lived in the 17th Century and is credited by many as the founder of the Maratha empire in Western India .
According to this post , authorities got the poster 's IP address of from Google and then paid a visit to Airtel to find out who it belonged to .
Airtel fingered Lakshmana .
Google has said repeatedly it has no option but to cooperate with official law enforcement inquiries - such as this case .
Indian police are saying it's not their fault for wrongly detaining a man for 50 days .
And an Airtel representative was quoted saying the company is " distressed by the severe inconvenience " caused to their customer .
Translation : if you live in a country where freedom of speech is not protected , you can be imprisoned for weeks at a time for no other reason than you use the net .
Sure , Google and your ISP may feel bad about your plight , but they certainly wo n't be standing behind you . ®
A new study comparing the composite output of 22 leading global climate models with actual climate data finds that the models do an unsatisfactory job of mimicking climate change in key portions of the atmosphere .
This research , published online in the Royal Meteorological Society 's International Journal of Climatology , raises new concerns about the reliability of models used to forecast global warming .
" The usual discussion is whether the climate model forecasts of Earth 's climate 100 years or so into the future are realistic , " said the lead author , Dr. David H. Douglass from the University of Rochester .
" Here we have something more fundamental : Can the models accurately explain the climate from the recent past ?
" It seems that the answer is no . "
Scientists from Rochester , the University of Alabama in Huntsville ( UAH ) and the University of Virginia compared the climate change " forecasts " from the 22 most widely - cited global circulation models with tropical temperature data collected by surface , satellite and balloon sensors .
The models predicted that the lower atmosphere should warm significantly more than it actually did .
" Models are very consistent in forecasting a significant difference between climate trends at the surface and in the troposphere , the layer of atmosphere between the surface and the stratosphere , " said Dr. John Christy , director of UAH's Earth System Science Center .
" The models forecast that the troposphere should be warming more than the surface and that this trend should be especially pronounced in the tropics .
" When we look at actual climate data , however , we do not see accelerated warming in the tropical troposphere .
Instead , the lower and middle atmosphere are warming the same or less than the surface .
For those layers of the atmosphere , the warming trend we see in the tropics is typically less than half of what the models forecast . "
The 22 climate models used in this study are the same models used by the UN Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change ( IPCC ) , which recently shared a Nobel Peace Prize with former Vice President Al Gore .

The atmospheric temperature data were from two versions of data collected by sensors aboard NOAA satellites since late 1979 , plus several sets of temperature data gathered twice a day at dozens of points in the tropics by thermometers carried into the atmosphere by helium balloons .
The surface data were from three datasets .
After years of rigorous analysis and testing , the high degree of agreement between the various atmospheric data sets gives an equally high level of confidence in the basic accuracy of the climate data .
" The last 25 years constitute a period of more complete and accurate observations , and more realistic modeling efforts , " said Dr. Fred Singer from the University of Virginia .
" Nonetheless , the models are seen to disagree with the observations .
We suggest , therefore , that projections of future climate based on these models should be viewed with much caution . "
The findings of this study contrast strongly with those of a recent study that used 19 of the same climate models and similar climate datasets .
That study concluded that any difference between model forecasts and atmospheric climate data is probably due to errors in the data .
" The question was , what would the models ' forecast ' for upper air climate change over the past 25 years and how would that forecast compare to reality ? " said Christy .
" To answer that we needed climate model results that matched the actual surface temperature changes during that same time .
If the models got the surface trend right but the tropospheric trend wrong , then we could pinpoint a potential problem in the models .
" As it turned out , the average of all of the climate models forecasts came out almost like the actual surface trend in the tropics .
That meant we could do a very robust test of their reproduction of the lower atmosphere .
" Instead of averaging the model forecasts to get a result whose surface trends match reality , the earlier study looked at the widely scattered range of results from all of the model runs combined .
Many of the models had surface trends that were quite different from the actual trend , " Christy said .
" Nonetheless , that study concluded that since both the surface and upper atmosphere trends were somewhere in that broad range of model results , any disagreement between the climate data and the models was probably due to faulty data .
" We think our experiment is more robust and provides more meaningful results . "

A relentless theme in the commentary on Ron Paul is that he is not really a Republican , mainly because he dissents from the party on foreign policy .
People now associate the Republican Party with crazed war - mongering , massive military spending , and relentless conflict - seeking , to the point even of a messianic global crusade on behalf of American imperial control .
This is madness , and Ron Paul does dissent .
But is he really departing from Republican tradition ?
In the 1990s , the GOP opposed Clinton ’s wars in Somalia and Serbia .
It denounced nation building as an extension of the domestic planning state .
But those were short - lived moments .
The party reverted to its war - mongering self after Bush came to power .
So for a genuinely non-interventionist policy within the Republican Party we need to go back further to the last of the great statesmen of mid-20th century America : Senator Robert Taft of Ohio , also known as Mr. Republican .
His 1951 book A Foreign Policy for Americans was a huge seller and exercised vast influence .
These were highly confusing times when Republicans were sure that FDR ’s wartime alliance with Russia , and especially Yalta ’s empowerment of Stalin in Europe , were grave errors .
So on one hand , they wanted to show that Russia was not a force for good in the world , and , in fact , represented a threat to liberty as grave as that of Nazi Germany .
On the other hand , they strongly suspected that Truman was “ triangulating ” the issue of the Russian threat to Europe as a way of stealing a Republican issue for Democratic policy advantage .
They were aghast at the flip - flop on the issue and feared playing into the hands of a new form of Democratic nationalism .
So Taft , in this book , is walking a fine line : warning against the Russian threat as a way of scoring anti-FDR points but also being careful not to exaggerate it in a way that would bolster the Truman plot to use the fear of Communism to extend the American empire .
More on the complexities here can be found in Rothbard ’s seminal work , Betrayal of the American Right , which everyone who seeks to understand this period in American political history must certainly read .
Hence , what is striking about this Taft book is not so much the specific policy recommendations but the principles that underlie what Taft considered to be the true Republican foreign policy .
I offer , then , words from the first Mr. Republican on the true principles of a Republican foreign policy :
The truth is that no nation can be constantly prepared to undertake a full - scale war at any moment and still hope to maintain any of the other purposes in which people are interested and for which nations are founded .
In the first place , it requires a complete surrender of liberty and the turning over to the central government of power to control in detail the lives of the people and all of their activities .
While in time of war people are willing to surrender those liberties in order to protect the ultimate liberty of the entire country , they do so on the theory that it is a limited surrender and one which they hope will soon be over , perhaps within a few months , certainly within a few years .
But an indefinite surrender of liberty such as would be required by an all - out war program in time of peace might mean the final and complete destruction of those liberties which it is the very purpose of the preparation to protect .
Furthermore , the destruction of that liberty in the long run will put an end to the constant progress which has characterized this country during its 160 years of life , a progress due more than anything else to the freedom of men to think their own thoughts , live their own lives , and run their own affairs .
It would require a complete surrender of all of our material and humanitarian aims to increase the standard of living of our people and of the people of our allies .
All of those standards of living would have to be reduced , because even the most optimistic do not feel that we can have all the guns we want and all the butter we want at the same time .
It would be impossible to conduct any such all - out program without inflation .
In World War II , in spite of complete controls , we saw an increase in prices , apparently permanent , of about 70 per cent , a depreciation of the dollar to sixty cents .
I doubt if any government spending program calling for half the national income could be undertaken which would not involve an increase in prices of at least 10 per cent every year and a corresponding depreciation in the value of the dollar .
This would mean the destruction of savings and life insurance policies .
It would mean a constant race between prices and wages .
It would mean hardship for millions , and doubt and uncertainty for many millions more .
It would mean constant domestic turmoil and disagreement .
Finally , it would interfere with the very production which is the great basis of the strength of the United States and to which not only our own people but all of our allies look for ultimate victory if there should be a war with Russia .
The truth is , also , that the most foresighted person could not set up a preparation that would protect us against every conceivable contingency .
One or two Pearl Harbors might lay us open to a dangerous attack .
We have to choose those measures which will give us the most complete protection within our reasonable economic capacity .
In short , there is a definite limit to what a government can spend in time of peace and still maintain a free economy , without inflation and with at least some elements of progress in standards of living and in education , welfare , housing , health , and other activities in which the people are vitally interested .
The question which we have to determine , and which apparently nobody in the Administration has really thought through , is the point at which we reach the economic limitation in time of peace on government expenditures and a military program .
After that we must choose between the various measures contributing to our defense , to determine which are of first importance and which can be ignored without serious danger .
( pp. 69—70 )
An unwise and overambitious foreign policy , and particularly the effort to do more than we are able to do , is the one thing which might in the end destroy our armies and prove a real threat to the liberty of the people of the United States … .
And when I say liberty I do not simply mean what is referred to as “ free enterprise . ”
I mean liberty of the individual to think his own thoughts and live his own life as he desires to think and to live ; the liberty of the family to decide how they wish to live , what they want to eat for breakfast and for dinner , and how they wish to spend their time ; liberty of a man to develop his ideas and get other people to teach those ideas , if he can convince them that they have some value to the world ; liberty of every local community to decide how its children shall be educated , how its local services shall be run , and who its local leaders shall be ; liberty of a man to choose his own occupation ; and liberty of a man to run his own business as he thinks it ought to be run , as long as he does not interfere with the right of other people to do the same thing .
We cannot overestimate the value of this liberty of ideas and liberty of action .
It is not that you or I or some industrial genius is free ; it is that millions of people are free to work out their own ideas and the country is free to choose between them and adopt those which offer the most progress .
I have been through hundreds of industrial plants in the last two or three years , and in every plant I find that the people running that plant feel that they have something in the way of methods or ideas or machinery that no other plant has .
I have met men said to be the best machinists in the industry who have built special machines for a particular purpose in which that company is interested .
Thousands of wholly free and independent thinkers are working out these ideas and have the right and ability to try them out without getting the approval of some government bureau .
You can imagine the difference between the progress under such a system and one in which the government ran every plant in the country as it runs the post offices today .
There would be one idea for a hundred that are now developed .
If any plant employee had an idea for progress and wrote to Washington , he probably would get back a letter referring him to Regulation No. 5201 ( c ) , which tells him exactly how this particular thing should be done , and has been done for the past fifty years .
It is clear to me that the great progress made in this country , the tremendous production of our people , the productivity per man of our workmen have grown out of this liberty and the freedom to develop ideas .
We have the highest standard of living , because we produce more per person than any other country in the world .
After the American Revolution and the French Revolution the whole world became convinced that liberty was the key to progress and happiness for the peoples of the world , and this theory was accepted , even in those countries where there was , in fact , no liberty .
People left Europe and came to this country , not so much because of the economic conditions as because they sought a liberty which they could not find at home .
But gradually this philosophy has been replaced by the idea that happiness can only be conferred upon the people by the grace of an efficient government .
Only the government , it is said , has the expert knowledge necessary for the people ’s welfare ; only the government has the power to carry out the grandiose plans so necessary in a complicated world .
Those who accept the principle of socialism , of government direction , and of government bureaucracy have a hard time battling against the ideology of communism .
Our labor union leaders cannot effectively fight communism , as such , because they favor a socialist control that comes very close to communism in the actual measures which are to be undertaken .
Even our statesmen seem to be handicapped in the same way .
Thus , Secretary Acheson only a year ago stated : “ To say that the main motive of American foreign policy was to halt the spread of communism was putting the cart before the horse .
The United States was interested in stopping communism chiefly because it had become a subtle instrument of Soviet imperialism . ”
With this point of view I emphatically disagree .
I believe that we should battle the principles of communism and socialism and convince the world that true happiness lies in the establishment of a system of liberty , that communism and socialism are the very antithesis of liberalism , and that only a nation conceived in liberty can hope to bring real happiness to its people or to the world .

Internationally renowned chemist and cook Hervé This *
Photo : Associated Press / Alexandra Boulat / VII * __White - haired scientist Hervé
This leans conspiratorially __over a crisp tablecloth at the Paris bistro where we are having lunch .
" They have my chocolat chantilly ! " he says with a chuckle .
" I invented it — but it was so easy , I 'm embarrassed ! "
This ( pronounced " Tees " ) came up with the formula for this confection in 1995 to prove that a scientific approach to cuisine can lead to all kinds of tasty new dishes .
Most people think of whipped cream — chantilly in French — as a simple combination of heavy cream and sugar .
This sees it as a specific ratio of fat , water , and gas .
Measure out some chocolate into a container , stir in the other two ingredients according to a particular formula , and you 've got mousse .
And , yes , it 's delicious .
This started his culinary career in 1980 , soon after he finished his Grandes Écoles diploma in physical chemistry .
One night , he invited friends to dinner and made a cheese soufflé from a recipe that said to add the egg yolks two at a time .
" Because I was a rational man , " he says , " I decided to put in all of the yolks together .
It was a failure . "
Intrigued ,
This began to collect what he calls " cooking precisions " — rules he gleaned from disparate sources like 19th - century cookbooks , old wives ' tales , and the tricks of modern chefs .
He then started testing these precisions to see which ones held up ( the skin on a suckling pig really does crackle more if you chop off its head right after roasting ) and which did n't ( a menstruating cook wo n't ruin mayonnaise ) .
For the next couple of years ,
This and a colleague , the late Oxford physicist Nicholas Kurti , conducted the experiments in their spare time .
In 1988 , the pair coined a term to describe their nascent field : molecular gastronomy .
Illustration by Pietari PostiThe name has since been applied to the kitchen wizardry of chefs like el Bulli's Ferran Adria and Alinea 's Grant Achatz .
But
This is interested in basic culinary knowledge — not flashy preparations — and has continued to accumulate his precisions , which now number some 25,000 .
He also has received a PhD in the field he created , served as an adviser to the French minister of education , published several books , lectured internationally , and even been invited to join the lab of one of his fans , Nobel Prize winning molecular chemist Jean - Marie Lehn .
In 2001 , This came up with a formal system of classification for what happens when foods are mixed , baked , whipped , fried , sautéed in lime juice , and so forth .
It shows , for example , how the 451 classical French sauces break down into 23 distinct types .
More important , the system allows the creation and pairing of billions of novel , potentially tasty dishes .
To demonstrate how , This randomly generated a formula describing the physical microstructure of a previously nonexistent dish , then asked chef Pierre Gagnaire to plug real ingredients into it .
The result — a bitter orange , scallop , and smoked - tea concoction — delighted Gagnaire 's customers .
As This guides me through the comfortably cluttered halls around his AgroParis Tech lab , he reviews his to - do list .
His team is using nuclear magnetic resonance to analyze carrot - based soup stocks and studying why green beans change color when cooked .
But he says that the next big idea he wants to tackle is the role that love — of the cook for the diners , the diners for the cook , and of everyone for each other — plays in determining tastes .
" Cooking for someone is a way of telling them , ' I love you . '
This has to be understood , of course , " This says before pausing for a second .
" But first , I do my job with the carrots . "

Finland 's Kovalainen left Renault after one season
The 26 - year - old , who scored 30 points in his maiden F1 season with Renault , has signed a " long - term contract " .
" I think Lewis and Heikki will be a formidable combination , " said McLaren chief executive Martin Whitmarsh .
" I am confident they 'll work well together . "
Spaniard Pedro de la Rosa , who had been vying with Kovalainen for a race seat , will remain as test driver .
McLaren were left looking for a second driver after Fernando Alonso left the team to return to Renault following a turbulent season in which he fell out with boss Ron Dennis and Hamilton .
606 : DEBATE Good for McLaren .
Now they have a driver lineup that can deliver
Kamonte
Norbert Haug , vice - president of McLaren 's engine partner Mercedes , said he was confident Hamilton and Kovalainen would form a strong partnership .
" Everybody in the team is looking forward to a very fruitful co-operation , " he said .
" Lewis and Heikki will form one of the youngest driver line - ups , and I am convinced that both will be very strong and at the same time co-operative competitors . "
Kovalainen - who has written a regular column for the BBC Sport website this year - had already been linked with a move to McLaren when it was confirmed earlier in December that Alonso and Nelson Piquet Jr would fill the race seats at Renault next season .
By joining McLaren , Kovalainen follows in the footsteps of fellow Finns Keke Rosberg , Mika Hakkinen and Kimi Raikkonen .
We will do everything we can to ensure that our championship challenge is as strong and focused as possible
Lewis Hamilton
" It 's an honour for me to follow in Mika and Kimi 's footsteps , " he said .
" I have n't really spent a lot of time with Lewis so far but from what I know I think we will work well together and do our best for the team . "
Hamilton , 22 , welcomed Kovalainen 's arrival .
" I am really looking forward to 2008 and working with Heikki as my team - mate , " said the Briton , who finished second in last season 's championship .
" Together with the team we will do everything we can to ensure that our championship challenge is as strong and focused as possible . "
Holiday Spam Splurge
Some of you might not remember this , but Virante runs an anti-linkspam tool called LinkSleeve which allows you to easily filter link spam from any online application ( blog , forum , guestbook , wiki , etc . )
The tool is very similar to Akismet ( in fact , it was released on the exact same day as Akismet years ago ) .
However , it does not require an API and uses XML - RPC rather than REST .
Regardless , we experienced an interesting , headache - inducing phenomena over Christmas .
While it is nearly impossible to determine if just a handful of spammers were responsible for the surge , we noticed a nearly 46 % increase in link spam generated over the last 3 days .
The variety of sources indicated that it was at least a handful of spammers , but it is difficult to determine if this was a trend , or if just a few individuals decided to go for it .
The spam itself was not particularly creative or professional , which explains in part why our filters were able to collect so much of it .
A couple of thoughts :
The Holiday Commercialism Incentivises Spam :
Because so much of our time and energy is spent on purchasing gifts during this part of the year , it makes sense that spammers would make extra efforts .
What many people forget is that while link - spam is primarily targeted at improving search rankings , click through traffic from well written spam is also valuable .
Given the greater amount of gift - related search and online traffic during this time period , it makes sense for spammers to go all out .

Absent Bloggers Means Greater ROI : I also imagine that bloggers and webmasters are asleep at the wheel , or not even at the wheel , for much of this time , giving spammers the opportunity to sneak links in when no one is looking .
While services like LinkSleeve protect bloggers for the most part , there are always a few that get through .
My recommendation is to always , always , always moderate .
Even if it takes an hour or longer .
Anyway , good try spammers .
Our honey - pot sites seemed to have withstood the onslaught quite well being protected by LinkSleeve , and I imagine Akismet sites have faired well too .

Finally , there ’s injustice : the subprime boom involved predatory lending  high - interest loans foisted on borrowers who qualified for lower rates  on an epic scale .
The Wall Street Journal found that more than 55 percent of subprime loans made at the height of the housing bubble “ went to people with credit scores high enough to often qualify for conventional loans with far better terms . ”
And in a declining housing market , these victims are stuck , unable to refinance .
So there are three problems .
But Mr. Paulson ’s plan  or , to use its official name , the Hope Now Alliance plan  is entirely focused on reducing investor losses .
Any minor relief it might provide to troubled borrowers is clearly incidental .
And it is does nothing for the victims of predatory lending .
The plan sets voluntary guidelines under which some , but only some , borrowers whose mortgage payments are set to rise may get temporary relief .
This is supposed to help investors , because foreclosing on a house is expensive : there are big legal fees , and the house normally sells for less than the value of the mortgage .
“ Foreclosure is to no one ’s benefit , ” said Mr. Paulson in a White House interactive forum .
“ I ’ve heard estimates that mortgage investors lose 40 to 50 percent on their investment if it goes into foreclosure . ”
But wo n’t the borrowers gain , too ?
Not if the planners can help it .
Relief is restricted to borrowers whose mortgage debt is at least 97 percent of the house ’s value  which means that in many , perhaps most , cases those who get debt relief will be borrowers who owe more than their house is worth .
These people would be nearly as well off in financial terms if they simply walked away .
And what about people with good credit who were misled into bad mortgage deals , who should have been steered to loans with better terms ?
They get nothing : the Paulson plan specifically excludes borrowers with good credit scores .
In fact , the plan actually provides an incentive for some people to miss debt payments , because that would make them look like bad credit risks and eligible for relief .
Providers should purge malware before it reaches inboxes .
Panda Software has joined the small but growing throng of security firms making the analogous connection between water supply and the quality of broadband connections .
" Comparisons can be made between the services offered by water companies and those provided by ISPs , " said the latest statement from Panda .
" Whereas the water companies are required to provide portable water , the ISPs are not subject to the equivalent demands . "
The argument is that ISPs should filter email for malware before it reaches subscribers ' inboxes .
Email filtering can be much more aggressive at the so - called ' cloud ' level before it arrives at consumers ' computers , because malware often originates from known ' bad sectors ' of the internet .
MessageLabs has been banging this drum for a few weeks , and BT announced last week that it is installing spam filters .
These will be used to ' clean ' its broadband supply and help subscribers who have unwittingly become components of botnets to sanitise their PCs .

Does it make sense to buy property ?
Halifax said this week that house prices are falling at the fastest rate since the crash of the early 1990s .
Will today 's buyers become trapped in negative equity ?
Patrick Collinson asks the pundits : are you mad to buy a property right now ?
Sarah Beeny , presenter of Channel 4's Property Ladder
" No , you 're definitely not mad to buy at the moment .
You have to look at it all relatively .
The reality is , people talk about a dip in the market but if you are buying a home today you are going to be in it for five , 10 or 15 years .
" Over that sort of time period it is just not going to be a problem .
Even if your home does come down a little in value , that just means the next one you buy will be cheaper as well . "
She says that potential buyers are in the grip of irrational fears .
" Interest rates really are n't at that high a level and it's quite a different economic climate to the early 1990s when rates were at 15 % .
People are n't in a position where they have to sell because they can't afford the mortgage . "
She warns firmly against trying to play the market .
" I think you would be a right idiot if you sell now and try to make a profit by buying back later .
I know people - even quite clever guys - who have tried to do this in the past , believing that prices were at a peak .
Within six months they could n't afford to buy back the flat that they had sold . "
But the true idiots , she says , are those who are tempted into investing in buy - to - let properties at this stage of the market .
" I have thought for some time now that buy - to - letters are bordering on the mental , buying properties on yields of just 3 % or 4 % . "
There 's no sign of any downturn in the market for TV property programmes .
Beeny has recently been shooting a new series of Property Ladder for broadcast early next year and even if interest in property does dry up , she has an alternative career up her sleeve .
She 's the founder of the UK 's fastest - growing dating website , mysinglefriend.com which now boasts more than 150,000 users .
Fergus and Judith Wilson , Britain 's biggest buy - to - let investors
" The prices of flats are dropping . "
Photograph : Martin Godwin
Fergus Wilson had just returned from a property auction when Guardian Money rang on Thursday this week .
" I bought a two - bed house about an hour ago for £ 119,000 , and I 'm hoping to get hold of another one that just missed its reserve price , " he says .
" I bought five houses from Wimpey last week and paid £ 153,000 each . "
All are in the Maidstone and Ashford area of Kent where the two former maths teachers have built a huge property empire valued today at around £ 250m .
Clearly this is not a man who thinks we are on the verge of a property crash .
" We own a total of 811 houses , and it should be 812 by the end of the day , " he says cheerfully .
But he only buys houses .
He never buys flats , which he says are crashing in price and will continue to do so for years to come .
" The prices developers who advertise in the newspapers are giving are pure fantasy .
The prices of flats are dropping , dropping and dropping .
There are some flats in Maidstone which went on the market at £ 240,000 relatively recently which are now being offered to me at £ 137,500 .
I would n't buy them even if they were down towards £ 100,000 . "
The only way to ensure future capital gains , he says , is to buy two - bed and three - bed houses .
The problem , he says , is that local planners are only giving the go - ahead for one and two - bed apartment blocks where there is already a glut of supply .
" There was a Persimmon development in Ashford where I bought eight two - bed houses at £ 130,000 each in 2004 .
The rest of the development were all flats at £ 132,000 each .
The houses have since gone up in value to £ 180,000 each but the flats are now selling for £ 127,000 .
The estate agents in Maidstone and Ashford are refusing to take any more flats on to their books .
I 'd advise anyone not to buy flats ; you just can't let them .
They have built far too many . "
He has been approached four times by wealthy Russian investors over the past year keen to buy his entire portfolio of properties .
So far he has n't sold out , but says he will if the price is right - but that price is likely to be north of £ 250m .
Gary McCausland , presenter of Channel 5's How To Be A Property Developer
McCausland : long - term outlook is good .
Photograph : Channel 5 / Andres Reynaga
McCausland is both a TV presenter and managing director of a property development company , and fears that some of today 's buyers could find themselves in negative equity next year .
" Over the short term , over next year , you could see some price falls , " he says .
" But that does n't mean you 're mad to buy a property .
Over the longer - term , property will remain one of the best things you can buy .
" You can always make money from property in any market - you 've just got to be careful to buy at the right price , " says the author of How to Make a Million From Property .
The key is to buy from a motivated seller - someone who really needs to sell or perhaps a repossession , he says .
" In Leeds , Birmingham and Manchester , there is a huge over - supply of flats , and in Northern Ireland , a lot of investors have lost out as prices have fallen over the past seven months .
" But next year you are going to see more rate cuts and that should stabilise the market .
There 's not going to be a crash and the British obsession with property is not about to go away . "
Davis was the gloomiest pundit we spoke to .
" Do n't touch property with a barge pole .
Over the next year house prices will go down by 5 - 10 % and over the next four to six years they will fall 30 - 40 % .
" It 's a natural market movement - when a market goes up 200 % in 10 - 15 years it can reasonably be expected to retrace 30 - 40 % over a four - year period .
" I'm very confident that in a few years people will be able to buy properties for prices they can currently only dream of . "

TEHRAN ( Reuters ) - Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said on Wednesday Tehran would never yield to international pressure to suspend its nuclear program .
A general view shows the nuclear power plant in Bushehr , south of Tehran , Iran February 26 , 2006 .
Russia has no chance of finishing Iran 's first nuclear power station before autumn 2008 , a year behind schedule , a Russian subcontractor helping to build the plant told RIA news agency on Wednesday .
REUTERS / Raheb Homavandi
“ Iran will never abandon its peaceful ( nuclear ) work .
Our nuclear work is legal and why should we stop it ? ” Ahmadinejad told state television .
The United States and other Western powers suspect Iran has a secret program to build nuclear weapons .
The oil - producing Islamic Republic says its nuclear program is only for generation of electricity for the benefit of its economy .
Two sets of U.N. sanctions have been imposed on Iran for defying Security Council resolutions demanding it suspend all nuclear fuel activity .
Ahmadinejad said any further U.N. resolutions would not prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear technology .
“ Let ’s say they issue resolution number 300 ... what will happen ?
It should be remembered that Iran is obtaining nuclear technology .
They have to eventually accept that , ” he said .
In an attempt to avert tougher sanctions , Tehran has agreed to increase cooperation with the U.N. ’s nuclear watchdog , the International Atomic Energy Agency , to clarify the scope of its atomic work .
Iran agreed during negotiations with the IAEA on Tuesday to let U.N. inspectors revisit its Arak nuclear reactor site early next week .
WARNING
Tehran has warned Washington , which has led efforts to isolate Iran over its nuclear program , to back off from broader sanctions , saying such measures would harm new diplomatic opportunities .
The United States and Iran agreed at a rare meeting on Tuesday to form a panel to examine ways to reduce violence in Iraq .
The two countries have not had diplomatic ties since shortly after Tehran ’s 1979 Islamic revolution .
European diplomats said last week Western powers had quietly shelved steps to toughen penalties against Iran until September so they could see the outcome of negotiations .
The IAEA inspectors would arrive in Tehran on Thursday , Iran ’s semi-official Fars news agency reported on Wednesday .
“ They will visit Iran ’s Isfahan Uranium Conversion facility ( UCF ) .
It is a routine visit , ” Fars said .
Ahmadinejad said Iran had “ some thousand centrifuges which are spinning every day ” .
Centrifuges are used to make fuel for power plants but can also be employed to enrich uranium to a higher level to make bomb material .
“ ( The West ) want us to stop right here ...
If we were to abide by their demands , we had to negotiate for 10 years to obtain only 20 centrifuges ... but look what we have now , ” said Ahmadinejad .
Diplomats have said Iran had installed about 2,000 centrifuges by early in June , most enriching uranium and others undergoing test “ dry runs ” without uranium in them .
The 3,000 mark was likely to be reached by the end of July , they said .
Three thousand could produce material for one bomb within a year if run non-stop at supersonic speed .
But analysts say Iran has yet to demonstrate such capability and probably remains a few years away from being able to build a bomb if it wants one .

Faster than a Tom Brady - to - Randy Moss slant , Saturday night 's Patriots - Giants game has gone from widely unavailable on TV to practically inescapable .
Until Wednesday , it looked as if the Patriots ' quest for regular - season perfection would be televised on only the NFL Network ( 43 million homes ) and in the two teams ' local markets ( 10 million homes ) .
Then NFL commissioner Roger Goodell stepped in .
Upon further review , he declared , the game would also be carried on both CBS and NBC , saying the action is " in the best interest of our fans . "
And he certainly redefined the 2007 holiday season .
The fifth day of Christmas , on Saturday , usually brings the same old five golden rings .
This year , it brings a multiplex of Patriots games .
But it 's less a gift from the NFL than a punt .
As they 've tried to make the NFL Network into a TV superpower , league officials have repeatedly miscalculated and faltered .
As a result , they 've been unable to budge the major cable operators off their position : that the NFL does n't belong on basic cable systems .
The cable companies have either marginalized the NFL Network on a premium sports tier ( as Comcast has done ) , or refused to carry it at all ( as Time Warner has done ) .
Roger Goodell and Jerry Jones made their case for the NFL Network in the Texas statehouse earlier this month , but it has n't helped .

If the league was ever to enjoy any negotiating leverage in this standoff , it was seemingly with the much - anticipated Pats - Giants game .
The thinking was that Big Cable would take heat from fans eager to see whether New England could complete a perfect 16 - 0 regular season , and perhaps have to come off its long - held position that too few of its customers give a hoot about the NFL Network to give in to the NFL 's demands : a place on their systems ' " extended basic " plans and a hefty fee of 70 cents per subscriber .
Turns out it was the NFL owners , not the cable guys , who wound up taking most of the heat for the game 's limited TV availability .
With the pocket caving in around him , Goodell was reduced to trotting out a goodwill public relations gimmick .
He ordered up the first three - network simulcast in league history and the first simulcast of any game since Super Bowl I in 1967 .
The Comcasts and Time Warners of the cable world are laughing up their sleeves .
They still have n't budged off their positions , and it looks as if they might never have to .
Meanwhile , the John Kerrys and Patrick Leahys of the Washington world are congratulating themselves .
Those two senators , along with other Capitol Hill pols , exerted political muscle on the league until Roger Goodell said " uncle . "
The NFL Network remains mired in as frustrating a run as the Miami Dolphins ( the 2007 -- not the 1972 -- version ) .
You might call this the business equivalent of " three - and - out " : a series of no - gainers that led to this week 's punt .
Let 's grab the Telestrator and break down the broken plays :
1 . The NFL overvalued its product and its leverage .
The four - year - old network 's problems started in 2006 , when it launched a package of eight Thursday and Saturday night games .
The NFL hiked the network 's asking price from 20 cents to 70 cents a subscriber , and the battle was joined .
" The NFL has a great belief about its importance in the world of sports , " says one veteran broadcast executive .
" It was overreaching on price and underestimating its opponents .
The big cable companies decided this was where they were going to pitch their tents and fight the rise of sports programming costs . "
The league hurt its cause by putting no " must see " game on the NFL Network 's 2006 schedule .
Compared to the Packers - Cowboys game on Nov. 29 this year , and the Patriots - Giants game this coming Saturday , there were no matchups to stir a public outcry .
The network 's Web site had an " I want my NFL Network " page , telling fans how to pressure their cable systems to carry the channel .
But there was n't enough of a fan uprising to make the cable operators cave .
2 . The NFL , which is accustomed to being in the driver 's seat on TV matters , mistakenly believed it could control this one , too .
It commands top dollar for its prize content -- a 53 percent rise in the latest round of broadcast deals -- which delivers $ 3.7 billion a year to the league .
But in the case of the NFL Network , it has only eight games a year to sell .
The vast majority of the network 's hours are filled with league news , game highlights and analyst chatter .
The big cable operators were n't buying the value of that , but some serious horse - swapping might have brought them around .
Consider the situation last spring with Major League Baseball .
It , too , was at swords ' points with the major cable operators after MLB sold exclusive rights to its " Extra Innings " package of out - of - market games to DirecTV , a satellite - only service that left cable subscribers out of the picture .
But MLB made peace -- and got itself broad cable carriage -- by selling a piece of its forthcoming MLB Network to Comcast , Time Warner and Cox .
The NFL refused to give the cable operators a stake in the NFL Network .
Nor has it been willing to cut the cable guys in on the Sunday Ticket package , now exclusively seen on DirecTV .
League officials maintain the other side is the intransigent one .
In the simulcast announcement , NFL Network CEO Steve Bornstein said , " A few of the biggest cable operators have refused to negotiate . "
Alex Dudley , a Time Warner Cable spokesman , rejected that as " fairly absurd .
We 've offered the NFL several different options , none of which they found appealing . "
3 . The NFL incorrectly counted on the government to aid its cause .
Starting last month , league officials , owners and lobbyists have been working the case on multiple fronts .
The league has backed a proposal by FCC chairman Kevin Martin that would give independent programmers such as the NFL Network a better shot at cracking the major cable TV systems .
The Dallas Cowboys ' Jerry Jones , who heads the owners ' NFL Network Committee , has been flitting around to various state legislatures , urging them to help the NFL Network 's cause by rewriting cable TV regulations .
Goodell even appeared with Jones at a hearing on the subject conducted by Texas legislators .
Given its strategy of government intervention , the NFL at first seemed to embrace Sen .
Kerry 's proposal , in a Dec. 6 letter , urging the league and the major cable operators to negotiate .
Otherwise , Kerry wrote , millions of fans would be unable to watch the potentially momentous Dec. 29 game featuring his home state Patriots .
Responded NFL spokesman Greg Aiello : " Commissioner Goodell welcomes the senator 's comments because we , too , want broad distribution for NFL Network . "
But Kerry 's letter failed to jump - start negotiations .
Comcast maintained it is in the middle of a multiyear contract to carry the NFL Network on its sports tier .
There was nothing to negotiate .
Time Warner rejected Goodell 's offer of " baseball style " arbitration : letting a neutral party decide what the cable giant should pay for the NFL Network .
As the date of the Patriots - Giants game approached , more of Washington 's political heat was being directed at the NFL .
Senate Judiciary Committee members Leahy , D - Vt. , and Arlen Specter , R - Pa. , threatened hearings on the antitrust exemption that the NFL enjoys for broadcast purposes .
On Monday , Kerry wrote Goodell a letter strongly suggesting that the game be put on NBC .
Otherwise , he said he 'd seek Senate hearings on " how the emergence of premium sports channels are impacting the consumer . "
Two days later , Goodell put the game on two broadcast networks .
All of which still leaves the NFL at fourth - and - longer - than - ever .
The commissioner maintained , in his announcement , that " our commitment to the NFL Network is stronger than ever . "
Spokesman Aiello believes Saturday 's simulcast will boost the network by exposing millions more fans to " the quality of the production . "
But , to lapse into coachspeak , the network 's game plan seems desperately in need of adjustments .
Would Bill Belichick ever stand for " 3 yards and a cloud of futility " ?
How much longer will NFL owners ?

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Iran halted work toward a nuclear weapon under international scrutiny in 2003 and is unlikely to be able to produce enough enriched uranium for a bomb until 2010 to 2015 , a U.S. intelligence report says .
A file satellite image shows Iranian nuclear facilities .
A declassified summary of the latest National Intelligence Estimate found with " high confidence " that the Islamic republic stopped an effort to develop nuclear weapons in the fall of 2003 .
The estimate is less severe than a 2005 report that judged the Iranian leadership was " determined to develop nuclear weapons despite its international obligations and international pressure . "
But the latest report says Iran -- which declared its ability to produce enriched uranium for a civilian energy program in 2006 -- could reverse that decision and eventually produce a nuclear weapon if it wanted to do so .
Enriched uranium at low concentrations can be used to fuel nuclear power plants , but much higher concentrations are needed to yield a nuclear explosion .
" We judge with moderate confidence that the earliest possible date Iran would be technically capable of producing enough highly enriched uranium for a weapon is late 2009 , but that this is very unlikely , " the report says .
A more likely time frame for that production is between 2010 and 2015 , it concludes .
Watch what new report says about Iran 's nuclear ambitions »
Iran has insisted its nuclear program is strictly aimed at producing electricity , and the country has refused the U.N. Security Council 's demand to halt its enrichment program .
Monday 's report represents the consensus of U.S. intelligence agencies .
It suggests that a combination of " threats of intensified international scrutiny and pressures , along with opportunities for Iran to achieve its security , prestige and goals for regional influence in other ways , " could persuade the Iranian leadership to continue its suspension of nuclear weapons research .
Available intelligence suggests the Iranian leadership is guided " by a cost - benefit approach , " not a headlong rush to develop a bomb , the report concludes .
U.S. National Security adviser Stephen Hadley expressed hope after Monday 's announcement , but he said Iran remains a serious threat .
" We have good reason to continue to be concerned about Iran developing a nuclear weapon even after this most recent National Intelligence Estimate , " he told reporters at the White House .
" In the words of the NIE , quote , Iranian entities are continuing to develop a range of technical capabilities that could be applied to producing nuclear weapons if a decision is made to do so . "
He said technology being developed for Iran 's civilian nuclear power program could be used to enrich uranium for use in weapons , and that Iran is continuing to develop ballistic missiles .
Hadley said the intelligence community came to the new conclusions on Tuesday , based on information gathered over the past few months , and President Bush was briefed about them on Wednesday .
He said U.S. policy toward Iran has not changed because of the new report .
" If we want to avoid a situation where we either have to accept Iran ... with a path to a nuclear weapon , or the possibility of having to use force to stop it , with all the connotations of World War III -- then we need to step up the diplomacy , step up the pressure , to get Iran to stop their so - called civilian uranium enrichment program , " he said .
" That 's our policy going forward -- no change . "
Sen . John D. Rockefeller IV , chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee , welcomed the news .
" The key judgments show that the intelligence community has learned its lessons from the Iraq debacle , " the West Virginia Democrat said in a statement .
" It has issued judgments that break sharply with its own previous assessments , and they reflect a real difference from the views espoused by top administration officials .
" This demonstrates a new willingness to question assumptions internally , and a level of independence from political leadership that was lacking in the recent past . "
Sen .
Joe Biden , chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , said the fact that Iran was several years away from nuclear weapons capability meant " the international community has a significant window of opportunity in which to act to avoid the stark choice between going to war or accepting a nuclear Iran . "
" But the Bush administration has long lacked a comprehensive strategy to take advantage of this window , " the Delaware Democrat and Democratic presidential hopeful said in a statement .
" Instead of continuing its obsession with regime change and irresponsible talk of ' World War III , ' we need a policy that focuses on conduct change . "
The International Atomic Energy Agency , the U.N. nuclear watchdog , has reported that Iran is cooperating with inspectors by providing access to declared nuclear material , documents and facilities .
However , the agency also said Iran is withholding information in other areas , and as a result , the IAEA 's knowledge about the status of the program is " diminishing . "
Iran says its uranium enrichment work is allowed under the 1968 Non-Proliferation Treaty .
The U.N. Security Council has passed two rounds of sanctions against Tehran , but Washington missed its goal of reaching consensus on tighter restrictions by the end of November , the State Department said last week .
The report comes amid widespread accusations that the Bush administration is attempting to maneuver the United States into a conflict with Iran , which it accuses of meddling in the war in Iraq .
In October , the United States designated elements of Iran 's Revolutionary Guard Corps as supporters of terrorism .
NIEs examine current capabilities and vulnerabilities and , perhaps more importantly , consider future developments .
Policymakers usually request the estimates , but the intelligence community also can initiate them .

Philosophy What is Neoconservatism ?
By Ryan McGreal
Published July 17 , 2007
It 's always a good idea to define your terms .
I 've made mention of neoconservatism and neoconservatives in my occasional blog posts that range outside urbanism into the larger political forces and dynamics in which we make our individual and local choices about energy , land use , political organization and public policy .
However , I 'm not sure that I 've defined just what I mean by neoconservatism .
Since the term is in such casual use and since it contains the word " conservative " , it 's often misunderstood or , at least , used in different ways by different people .
So : here is my working definition .
I do n't aim to be politically neutral , but I do aim to be accurate in my vituperation .
A Definition of Neoconservatism
First of all , neoconservatives are not conservatives .
They 're ex-Trotskyists who switched to rooting for the other team .
They 're messianic , big - idea megalomaniacs who are 100 percent convinced they can run the world better than the rabble and , like any good dogmatist , they do n't let facts get in the way of their enthusiasm .
They 're committed to the normalization of deception and the inherent value of secrecy ; favouring the exercise of force rather than diplomacy to make other countries obey America 's will ; and the moral supremacy of the United States and its unquestionable right to promote its interests and actively block real or potential rivals using any means necessary .
The neoconservative movement seems to have started with a group of Chicago school academics who congregated around a quirky classics professor named Leo Strauss , whose political philosophy was based around a mix of Platonism and his own theory that all classical works had an overt text plus a hidden , esoteric subtext that only great thinkers could decipher and interpret .
He was unapologetically aristocratic in the sense that he believed the general public was not intelligent and sophisticated enough to make policy decisions , and he supported Plato 's idea of the Noble Lie , in which people are fed myths that allow them to live in an uncertain world and accept the authority of their betters .
His students and adherents include Allan Bloom , Paul Wolfowitz , Abram Shulsky , Elliot Abrams , and William Kristol ( whose father , Irving Kristol , is sometimes called the " godfather of neoconservatism " and who shares many of Strauss ' political beliefs ) .
As Kristol explained his political beliefs :
There are different kinds of truths for different kinds of people .
There are truths appropriate for children ; truths that are appropriate for students ; truths that are appropriate for educated adults ; and truths that are appropriate for highly educated adults , and the notion that there should be one set of truths available to everyone is a modern democratic fallacy .
It does n't work .
That 's neoconservatism in a nutshell .
Take a guess which people qualify as the " highly educated adults " entitled to the most select truths .
Neoconservatism and Intelligence
In 1999 , neoconservatives Abram Shulsky and Gary Schmitt wrote an essay , Leo Strauss and the World of Intelligence ( By Which We Do Not Mean Nous ) , in which they argued that setting high standards for evidence in intelligence gathering and interpreting it according to universal , empirical methods can lead analysts astray by " ignor[ing ] the differences among ' regimes ' ( or types of government and society ) in its search for universal truths of social science . "
Shulsky and Schmitt counter that Strauss 's emphasis on esoteric meanings
alerts one to the possibility that political life may be closely linked to deception .
Indeed , it suggests that deception is the norm in political life , and the hope , to say nothing of the expectation , of establishing a politics that can dispense with it is the exception .
In other words , " regimes " based on deception must lying , and if social science - based intelligence cannot demonstrate those lies , that is simply evidence of its inferiority as a research tool .
It allows analysts to draw conclusions before they start researching , and to interpret anything they find - or fail to find - in light of their conclusions .
Imagine the implications of this " esoteric " approach to evidence for neoconservative analysts trying to decide , say , whether Iraq was secretly restocking its prohibited weapons of mass destruction or whether Iraq had secretive connections to al - Qaeda .
Former US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld hid behind this reasoning in August 2003 when questioned about whether the US military had found any WMD in western Iraq .
He talked about how hard it is to find anything in the desert and concluded , " as we all know , the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence . "
Shulsky himself went on to head the infamous Office of Special Plans in 2002 , an ad hoc organization under the Department of Defense that second - guessed the traditional intelligence estimates and cherry - picked through US intelligence data to find connections between al - Qaeda and Irag after the CIA dismissed such claims .
Its claims about Iraqi ties to al - Qaeda and possession of prohibited weapons , always based on flimy evidence and the testimony of interested parties ( like Ahmed Chalabi ) and torture victims , turned out to be false .
Neoconservatism and Foreign Policy
In 1996 , a group of prominent neoconservatives articulated their belligerent foreign policy in a strategy paper prepared for the Institute for an Israeli think tank titled A Clean Break : A New Strategy for Securing the Realm .
According to the paper , Israeli foreign policy should emphasize a " clean break from the slogan , ' comprehensive peace ' to a traditional concept of strategy based on balance of power " and " upholding the right of hot pursuit for self defense into all Palestinian areas [ emphasis in original ] " .
Translation :
There are no ' rights ' in contests among nations ; there is only strength .
The paper was written based on a discussion among Richard Perle , Douglas Feith , David Wurmser , and others .
Richard Perle is known in Washington as the " Prince of Darkness " and went on to lead the influential Defense Policy Board in its relentless pursuit of a war against Iraq .
He generated additional controversy by admitting that the war was illegal but that " international law stood in the way of doing the right thing . "
He eventually quit the DPB over a conflict of interest based on his business interests in the defence industry .
Douglas Feith was Donald Rumsfeld 's Under Secretary of Defense for Policy and oversaw the controversial Office of Special Plans .
Feith resigned in 2005 .
David Wurmser , in turn , went from the American Enterprise Institute to the Pentagon and then to the State Department to work under John " There 's no such thing as the United Nations " Bolton , then an Under Secretary of State and later the US ambassador to ... the United Nations .
Wurmser jumped to the National Security Council and now works in the office of Vice President Dick Cheney .
Neoconservatives in US Government
The chief neoconservative enclaves are the American Enterprise Institute ( AEI ) and the Project for a New American Century ( PNAC ) , two organizations whose members have had an extraordinary influence and direct involvement in the Bush administration .
One reason PNAC jumps out is that its members include a who's who of Bush administration policymakers and GOP apparatchiks , including : Vice President Dick Cheney , Donald Rumsfeld , former Undersecretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz , former Vice Presidential Chief of Staff I. Lewis " Scooter " Libby ( who just had his prison sentence for obstruction of justice commuted by the President ) , US Ambassador to the United Nations Zalmay Khalilzad ( formerly US ambassador to Afghanistan and then to Iraq ) , Under - Secretary of State Paula Dobriansky , and former Assistant Secretary of Defence Peter Rodman .
The neoconservatives sold the American public a false bill of goods , invading countries to serve their pre-existing geostrategic objectives under the cover of the " war on terror " .
( Rumsfeld ordered his staff to start making a case against Iraq within hours of the 9/11 attacks , even though there was no evidence Iraq had anything to do with it . )
All the things the PNAC neoconservatives promised - the invasion was necessary to protect Americans against WMD attacks , it would be quick and easy , it would pay for itself , US troops would be welcomed as liberators , etc. - were slowly , grindingly revealed as a fetid mash of lies , distortions , and wishful thinking .
The neoconservative promise that the war would strengthen the US by spreading " democracy " and stability through the Middle East while asserting the primacy of US power is a painful embarrassment today .
Unfortunately , we see the next step unfolding with the ongoing campaign to soften the American public for some kind of strike against Iran .
Neoconservative Goals
The neoconservatives steering the Bush administration want to control the world in the interest of US corporate power for as long into the future as they can .
They want the controversial Defense Policy Guidance draft written in 1992 by then - Defense Secretary Dick Cheney 's under - secretaries , Paul Wolfowitz and I. Lewis " Scooter " Libby , to be America 's official foreign policy :
Our first objective is to prevent the re-emergence of a new rival .
This is a dominant consideration underlying the new regional defense strategy and requires that we endeavor to prevent any hostile power from dominating a region whose resources would , under consolidated control , be sufficient to generate global power .
These regions include Western Europe , East Asia , the territory of the former Soviet Union , and Southwest Asia .
There are three additional aspects to this objective :
First the U.S must show the leadership necessary to establish and protect a new order that holds the promise of convincing potential competitors that they need not aspire to a greater role or pursue a more aggressive posture to protect their legitimate interests .
Second , in the non-defense areas , we must account sufficiently for the interests of the advanced industrial nations to discourage them from challenging our leadership or seeking to overturn the established political and economic order .
Finally , we must maintain the mechanisms for deterring potential competitors from even aspiring to a larger regional or global role .
[ emphasis added ]
That strategy re-emerged in the 1990s in PNAC .
Their principal policy document , titled Rebuilding America 's Defenses ( PDF ) , advocates :
At present the United States faces no global rival .
America 's grand strategy should aim to preserve and extend this advantageous position as far into the future as possible .
...
Preserving the desirable strategic situation in which the United States now finds itself requires a globally preeminent military capability both today and in the future .
...
In broad terms , we saw [ this ] project as building upon the defense strategy outlined by the Cheney Defense Department in the waning days of the Bush Administration .
The Defense Policy Guidance ( DPG ) drafted in the early months of 1992 provided a blueprint for maintaining U.S. preeminence , precluding the rise of a great power rival , and shaping the international security order in line with American principles and interests .
Incidentally :
[ T ]he process of [ military ] transformation , even if it brings revolutionary change , is likely to be a long one , absent some catastrophic and catalyzing event – like a new Pearl Harbor .
PNAC Influence
Do n't underestimate this group 's influence .
Under the Bush administration , which is packed with PNAC members , it does n't take long for the think tank 's recommendations to become government policy .
PNAC asked for a much bigger military budget , and the Bush administration delivered .
PNAC asked for a new nuclear weapons policy , arguing that " there may be a need to develop a new family of nuclear weapons designed to address new sets of military requirements , such as would be required in targeting the very deep underground , hardened bunkers that are being built by many of our potential adversaries " , and the Bush administration drafted the Nuclear Posture Review that loosens the conditions for an American nuclear strike .
PNAC asked for a new emphasis on ground - and satellite - based ballistic missile defense , complaining that " The Clinton Administration 's adherence to the 1972 AMB Treaty has frustrated development of useful ballistic missile defenses " , and the Bush administration obliged , beefing up its missile defense budget and withdrawing from the ABM treaty .
PNAC asked for a new unilateral , pre-emptive , and Reaganite approach to foreign policy , and the Bush administration responded with its National Security Strategy , of which PNAC heartily approved .
PNAC also demanded that America pursue regime change as well as maintaining a permanent military presence in geostrategic regions , stating :
The need to respond with decisive force in the event of a major theater war in Europe , the Persian Gulf or East Asia will remain the principal factor in determining Army force structure ... it is essential to retain sufficient capabilities to bring them to a satisfactory conclusion , including the possibility of a decisive victory that results in long - term political or regime change
and
the need for a substantial American force presence in the Gulf transcends the issue of the regime of Saddam Hussein .
As former Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill , former counter - terrorism expert Richard A. Clarke and others have made clear , the Bush administration had its sights on Iraq as early as January 2001 .
Right from the start , they planned to topple Saddam Hussein and remake the Middle East .
September 11 was the perfect red herring and they 've exploited it for all it's worth .
Neo-Reality
Finally , US journalist Ron Suskind summarized the neoconservative view on reality in a 2004 essay that explored the certainty of President Bush through this exchange with a senior Bush advisor :
The aide said that guys like me were " in what we call the reality - based community , " which he defined as people who " believe that solutions emerge from your judicious study of discernible reality . "
I nodded and murmured something about enlightenment principles and empiricism .
He cut me off .
" That 's not the way the world really works anymore , " he continued .
" We 're an empire now , and when we act , we create our own reality .
And while you 're studying that reality - judiciously , as you will - we 'll act again , creating other new realities , which you can study too , and that 's how things will sort out .
We 're history 's actors ... and you , all of you , will be left to just study what we do . "
As such , Leo Strauss 's disdainn for empiricism and emphasis on esoteric meanings comes full circle .

You may not know it , but you 're part virus .
At least , some of your genes come from viruses that slipped their DNA into the genes of our primate ancestors millions of years ago .
The DNA remnants of these ancient " retroviruses , " distant relatives of today 's HIV , account for an estimated 8 percent of the human genetic code and may have enabled master genes that account for some of the differences between us and our chimpanzee relatives .
Master genes
Not all genes are created equal ; the master genes can turn the others on and off , thus gaining control over genes related to cell division , DNA repair and programmed cell death .
( This regulation of genes allows for tighter control of gene expression ( i.e. which genes are turned on or off ) , which can account for the wide differences between humans and other apes , despite our very similar genetic codes . )
One such gene , called p53 , has the job of coordinating the surveillance system that monitors the well - being of cells .
It is so important in this job that when it fails , cancer is often the result — biologists even call it the " guardian of the genome . "
Scientists had long wondered how genes such as p53 built their powerful empire over other genes .
A new study detailed this week in the online edition of the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences implicates the ancient retroviruses as the force behind p53's rise to power .
Repetitive DNA
Scientists at the University of California , Santa Cruz , analyzed and compared genetic data from different species and found that certain retroviruses entered the genome about 40 million years ago and spread rapidly in primates about 25 million years ago .
Earlier research had shown that the DNA remnants of retroviruses like to jump around in the genetic code , and it's this movement into new positions throughout the human genome that spread copies of repetitive DNA sequences , which in turn allowed p53 to regulate many other genes , the UCSC team said .
( The association between the sequences and gene regulation had been suspected as far back as 1971 . )
" This would have provided a mechanism to quickly establish a gene regulatory network in a very short evolutionary time frame , " said lead researcher Ting Wang .
The results also call into question previous views that these repetitive sequences , or so - called junk - DNA , did n't code for anything or serve a particular purpose .
" We 're starting to uncover the treasure in this junk , " Wang said .
Sgt Podge is collected between 0800 and 0815 GMT every day
Podge 's daily ride
Sgt Podge , a Norwegian Forest Cat , disappears from his owner 's home in Talbot Woods , Bournemouth , every night .
The next morning , the 12 - year - old cat can always be found in exactly the same place , on a pavement about one and a half miles ( 2.4 km ) away .
His owner , Liz Bullard , takes her son to school before collecting Sgt Podge .
She said the routine began earlier this year , when Sgt Podge disappeared one day .
Ms Bullard rang the RSPCA and began telephoning her neighbours to see if anyone had seen him .
Owner Liz Bullard thinks Sgt Podge crosses a golf course every night
An elderly woman who lived about one and a half miles away called back to say she had found a cat matching Sgt Podge 's description .
Ms Bullard collected him but within days he vanished again .
She rang the elderly woman to find Sgt Podge was back outside her home .
She said a routine has now become established , where each morning she takes her son to school before driving to collect Sgt Podge from the pavement between 0800 and 0815 GMT .
It is thought Sgt Podge walks across Meyrick Park Golf Course every night to reach his destination .
Ms Bullard said : " If it 's raining he may be in the bush but he comes running if I clap my hands . "
All she has to do is open the car passenger door from the inside for Sgt Podge to jump in .
When he gets home Sgt Podge has breakfast before going to sleep
Ms Bullard also makes the trip at weekends and during school holidays - when her son is having a lie in .
She does not know why , after 12 years , Sgt Podge has begun the routine but explained that another woman who lived nearby used to feed him sardines , and that he may be on the look - out for more treats .
" As long as you know where they are you do n't mind as a cat owner , " Ms Bullard said .
" I know where to collect him - as long as he's not wandering the streets . "
Back at home , Sgt Podge has breakfast before going to sleep by a warm radiator .

We 've all been there :
You 're out and about , and you need to figure out where you are , what 's around you , and how to get there .
Google Maps for mobile can help you do all that , but first you have to enter in a starting point using the keypad .
And let 's face it -- entering things into your phone using the keypad is so 2006 .
While some people are lucky enough to have GPS - enabled mobile phones that provide location information for Google Maps for mobile , the vast majority of us are not .
So what to do ?
Starting today , we have an answer : Google Maps for mobile with My Location .
My Location is a new beta technology from Google that uses cell tower identification to provide you with approximate location information , so it will work on phones without GPS .
Simply fire up Google Maps for mobile , press [ 0 ] , and the map will indicate your approximate location by centering on a blue circle like this :
If you do have a GPS - enabled device , My Location can actually complement it .
My Location kicks in faster than GPS in most cases , so you can access your location even faster on the map .
It also works reliably indoors ( unlike GPS ) and does n't drain your phone battery at the rate that GPS does .
Of course , this feature is in beta , which in this case means a few different things :
First , although accuracy and coverage may vary , both will improve over time as more and more people use Google Maps for mobile .
Second , My Location is n't currently supported on all devices ( see our Help Center for more on this ) ; we 're working on that .
Third , we 'd love to get your feedback on it -- feel free to leave your comments below .
To give Google Maps for mobile with My Location a try , text " MYLOCATION " to 33669 , or head to www.google.com/gmm on your mobile browser .
If you 'd like to learn more about the My Location technology , take a look at this short video :
Britain's house price growth will be halved next year as the global financial crisis exacerbates the impact of rising mortgage rates , according to Nationwide , the biggest mortgage lender .
After the dramatic bail - out of high street bank Northern Rock underlined the impact of the American ' sub - prime ' mortgage crisis on Britain 's financial sector , Fionnuala Earley , Nationwide 's group economist , said she expected house price inflation to slow to around 3 per cent next year .
Thousands of anxious customers queued outside Northern Rock branches for a second day yesterday , ignoring calls for calm from the Chancellor , Alistair Darling , and the bank 's management , and sparking fears of a full - blown ' run ' on the bank .
Speaking to Channel 4
News last night , Darling said he had been assured by the Financial Services Authority that Northern Rock was capable of meeting its financial obligations to its customers .
In the first signs of political fallout from the crisis , David Cameron accused Gordon Brown of failing to rein in public and private borrowing over the last decade , saying the nation 's economic growth is based on a ' mountain of debt ' .
Writing in today 's Sunday Telegraph , the Tory leader says : ' This government has presided over a huge expansion of public and private debt without showing awareness of the risks involved .
' Though the current crisis may have had its trigger in the United States ... under Labour our economic growth has been built on a mountain of debt . '
House price growth was running at just below 10 per cent in August , but Nationwide believes it will have dropped to 7 per cent by December and continue slowing throughout next year .
The worldwide credit crunch that pushed Northern Rock to the brink of collapse could make a housing market slowdown worse , Earley warned .
' I think all it can do is make it [ the market ] cooler : that comes through sentiment , and through expectations . '
With base interest rates at a six - year high of 5.75 per cent , economists said that the feelgood factor was already evaporating and that the Northern Rock crisis could deal a fresh blow to confidence .
' This confirms some of the fears that people had , and reinforces the idea that they need to be more circumspect , and that money is tighter , ' said Richard Hyman , director of retail research firm Verdict .
' It could n't have come at a worse time : consumer confidence was already heading south , ' said Kevin Hawkins , director general of the British Retail Consortium , though he added that , as long as Northern Rock was the only casualty , the effects could be short - lived .
A report from property website Rightmove , released on Friday , showed that property prices fell in the last month for the first time in three years .
It is expected that , although there will be overall growth in the housing market , some areas of the UK could suffer significant price decline .
Meanwhile , Northern Rock apologised to customers last night , saying it was ' disappointed to see uncertainty caused ' .
The apology came amid growing speculation of a takeover bid , with HSBC and Lloyds TSB both being mooted as potential suitors .
Insiders are predicting that a takeover could occur within weeks to secure the bank 's future .
One plan currently being looked at by City bankers is to divide the company 's £ 100 billion mortgage portfolio between some of the major banks .
Savers have been rushing to pull out their cash since it emerged last Thursday that Darling had sanctioned an emergency loan from the Bank of England to prevent Northern Rock going bust .
One couple had even camped outside Northern Rock 's Cheltenham branch in Gloucestershire overnight , desperate to withdraw the £ 1 m proceeds of a house sale .
' We were told that because our money was in an online account we would n't be able to withdraw it there and then , ' said Fiona Howard .
' That money is our lifeline , as we are living in rented accommodation at present . '
■ Rails で OpenID を使う ( コンシューマ編 )
OpenID の中身 ( 特に Ruby での実装 ) を調べるために、まずは OpenID のコンシューマを Rails で動かしてみることにした 。
インストー ル
もうみん なOpenIDにを参考に ruby - openid と openid_login_generator を入れる 。
$ sudo gem install ruby - openid $ sudo gem install openid_login_generator
バージョンはこんな感じ。（関係あるところだけ抜粋）
$ gem list -- local openid_login_generator ( 0.1 ) [ Rails ] OpenID Login generator .
rails ( 1.2.5 ) Web- application framework with template engine , control - flow layer , and ORM .
ruby - openid ( 1.1.4 ) A library for consuming and serving OpenID identities .
ruby - yadis ( 0.3.4 ) A library for performing Yadis service discovery
ジェネレータで OpenID コンシューマを作 成
Rails アプリの作成。データベースには SQLite3 を使うことにした 。
$ rails -d sqlite3 consumer $ cd consumer
generate openid_login を使って OpenID コンシューマのひな形を作る。 まずは使い方を調べる 。
$ ./script/generate openid_login -- help SYNOPSIS openid_login [ Controller name ]
Good names are Account Myaccount Security DESCRIPTION
This generator creates a general purpose login system .
Included : - a User model which stores OpenID authenticated users - a Controller with login , welcome and logoff actions - a mixin which lets you easily add advanced authentication features to your abstract base controller EXAMPLE ./ script/generate openid_login Account
引数にコントローラ名を渡せばいいのか。 「 Account Myaccount Securityみたいな名前にするといいよ」だって。 EXAMPLE の通りに作ってみる。
$ ./script/generate openid_login Account create lib/openid_login_system.rb create app/controllers/account_controller.rb create app/helpers/account_helper.rb create app/models/user.rb create app/views/layouts/scaffold.rhtml create public/stylesheets/scaffold.css create app/views / account create app/views/account/welcome.rhtml create app/views/account/login.rhtml create app/views/account/logout.rhtml create README_LOGIN
model に user.rb , controller に account_controller.rb が生成された。 view は welcome , login , logout の 3つ。 lib に openid_login_system.rb が出来ているけど、これは後で読もう。
まず README_LOGIN を簡単に読んでみる。 データベースに users テーブルを作れって書いてある。 それから、認証を必要とするコントローラには before_filter : login_required を使えと。 これは OpenID に限らず一般的な話か 。
とりあえず users テーブルを作る。 ジェネレータを使ってマイグレーションファイルを用意する。
OpenID ログインジェネレータが生成した user.rb を上書きしないように注意 。
$ script / generate model user openid_url : string exists app / models / exists test / unit/ exists test / fixtures / overwrite app/models /user.rb ? [ Ynaqd ] n skip app / models / user.rb overwrite test/unit/user_test.rb ?
[ Ynaqd ] n skip test/unit/user_test.rb overwrite test/fixtures/users.yml ?
[ Ynaqd ] n skip test / fixtures / users.yml create db/ migrate create db/ migrate/001_create_users.rb
rake コマンドで users テーブルを作成。 カラムは id と openid_url の 2 つ 。
$ rake db:migrate ( in /home / machu/work/misc/openid/consumer ) == CreateUsers : migrating ===================================================== -- create_table ( : users ) -> 0.0039s == CreateUsers : migrated ( 0.0051s ) ============================================
最後にサーバを起動、と。
$ script / server
使ってみ る
本当はアプリ本体のコントローラとかも作るんだけど、とりあえずログイン部分だけを使ってみる。
まずは、ジェネレータが作った account コントローラのメソッドを調査。
$ grep - E ' ^\s *( class|def|module ) ' app/controllers/account_controller.rb class AccountController < ApplicationController def login def complete def logout def welcome def consumer def find_user
consumer と find_user はプライベートなメソッドなので、アクションは login , complete , logout , welcome の 4つ か 。
ログイン画面 ( loginアクション )
Web ブラウザから login アクションを呼び出す 。
http://axela.machu.jp:3000/account/login
account_controller.rb の中身はこんな感じ。 POST じゃない場合（最初に呼び出した場合）は何もせずに login.rhtml を呼び出しているだけ 。
def login openid_url = @params [ : openid_url ] if @request.post ?
# 中略 end end
ログイン画面で OpenID のアカウント名 ( URL ) を入力して Login ボタンを押す。 今回は試しに、はてな のOpenIDアカウントを使ってみた。 今度は POST リクエストが送られるので、 login メソッドの中略部分が実行される。 return_to に complete アクションを指定している。 これは、はてなでのログイン後には complete アクションに帰ってきてねってこと 。
request = consumer.begin( openid_url ) case request.status when OpenID :: SUCCESS return_to = url_for( : action= > ' complete ' ) trust_root = url_for ( : controller= >'' ) url = request.redirect_url( trust_root , return_to ) redirect_to( url ) return when OpenID :: FAILURE # 略 else # 略 end
consumer .
begin がたぶんポイント。 この時点でコンシューマ ( Rails アプリ ) がはてなのサーバにアクセスして、鍵交換などをやっているはず。 はてなサーバとの通信に成功すれば ( OpenID : : SUCCESSが返ってくれば ) はてなのログイン画面 へWebブラウザをリダイレクトさせている。 リダイレクト先は OpenID ライブラリの request.redirect_url で生成している。
はてなサーバとの鍵交換のデータは、 db / openid - store に保存されてるっぽい。 associations に鍵交換情報。nonces にノンスが入ってる。 ノンスについて はOpenIDをとりまくセキュリティ上の脅威とその対策 − ＠ IT が参考になる。
$ ls db/ openid- store /** db/openid-store/associations : http-www.hatena.ne.jp_2Fopenid_2Fserver-BOrhJFCxctkhbPb5ULxJlm_h88w db/openid-store/nonces :
YHQYIZtx db / openid - store / temp :
associations に入っているデータは以下の通り。 はてなサーバとの通信用の HMAC キーなどが入ってる 。
version : 2 handle : 1195960051:uB4vs2DTjZ8i7Wlog16l:29256cf179 secret : 5uUyv35I/eibJD+KJfPwdp8mzR8= issued : 1195960089 lifetime : 1198349 assoc_type : HMAC-SHA1
もうみん なOpenIDにに書かれている active_record_openid_store を使えば、この情報が ActiveRecord に格納されるんだろう。たぶん。
ログイン処理 ( はてなサーバ )
はてなサーバにリダイレクトされたあとは、はてなにログインしていなければログイン画面が表示される。
ログイン後に、IDを教えてもいいかどうかの確認画面が表示される。
この辺ははてなの認証APIと同じような感じ。 とりあえず 「 今回のみ許可」を選ぶ。
ログイン結果の受け取り
はてなから Rails 側へと戻ってくる。 login アクションで指定したとおり、 complete アクションが呼ばれる。 ポイントは consumer .
complete メソッド。このメソッド内でログインに成功したかどうかを確認している。
ログインに成功していれば ( OpenID :: SUCCESSが返っていれば )
、データベースにユーザを追加し、セッションにユーザIDを格納している。 その後、 welcome アクションへと転送する 。
def complete response = consumer.complete(@params ) case response.status when OpenID :: SUCCESS @user = User.get(response.identity_url ) if @user.nil ?
@user = User.new ( : openid_url => response.identity_url ) @user.save end @session[:user_id ] = @user.id flash [ : notice ] = " Logged in as # {CGI ::escape( response.identity_url ) } " redirect_to :action => " welcome " return when OpenID :: FAILURE if response.identity_url # 略 else # 略 end when OpenID :: CANCEL # 略 else # 略 end redirect_to : action => ' login ' end
この時点で DB にユー ザIDが格納される。
$ sqlite3 db/development.sqlite3 sqlite > select * from users ;
1| http://www.hatena.ne.jp/kmachu/
welcome アクションは何もやっていない。welcome.rhtmlが呼ばれるだけ。
OpenID のアカウント名が（なぜかパーセントエンコーディングされて）表示される。
ここまでのまと め
説明するとややこしく感じるかもしれないけど、そんなことない。
エラー処理を除けば、実質的にやっていることといえば、以下の2つだけだから。
(1) ログイン画面の呼び出 し
ユーザが入力した OpenID アカウントを元に認証サーバへと誘導する。
request = consumer.begin( openid_url ) url = request.redirect_url(trust_root , return_to ) redirect_to( url )
( 2) ログイン結果の受け取 り
認証サーバでのログイン結果を受け取る。
response = consumer.complete(@params ) # response.identity_url でユーザIDを取得できる
と言うわけで、次は OpenID ライブラリの begin , redirect_url , complete が何をやっているかを調べようっと 。
As consumers experiment with the Linux operating system and consider switching from Windows , the first carryover they expect to find is applications for virus and spyware protection .
However , few exist because Linux does not need them .
Nearly all Linux distributions bundle a firewall package , but they do n’t include other intrusion protection software .
That does not mean that Linux users are completely worry free about the security concerns of Windows and Mac platform users .
However , the risk level from e-mail attachments , viruses and worms is practically nil .
Setting Up Correctly
“ The Linux OS is ironclad , especially compared to Windows and even the Mac OS , ” James Bottomley , Linux expert and chief technology officer of SteelEye Technology told LinuxInsider .
“ But just like in your own home , if you leave a door open , you are going to get robbed sooner or later .
The way to keep the door closed in Linux is to set policies correctly . ”
With most Linux distributions , this is often hard to get right if there is no IT support , cautioned Bottomley , who is the gatekeeper of the Linux Kernel SCSI Maintainership , and is on the board of directors for the Open Source Development Labs ( OSDL ) .
Linux is better at locking down a computer than Windows .
The Linux OS uses configuration settings and user permissions to a much more efficient degree than the Windows administrator account .
To do this , non-enterprise users should seek help from third - party security suites that serve as configuration managers , he said .
The only other major concern for home and small - business users is to update the software regularly by setting the Internet updates to automatic within the system administration .
This is a similar process to the Microsoft Windows update .
“ Users should be sure to click on the update icon whenever it notifies them of a new security or software patch , ” Bottomley explained .
“ Other than that , Linux users do not need to burden their systems with third - party antivirus products .
Most vendors are not addressing the Linux virus threat because it does not exist .
There are no known forms of Linux attacks using that vector , either infected attachments or viruses . ”
User Levels
The difference between a home desktop Linux user and a Linux user within a protected enterprise environment is blurring more every day , according to Mike Ferris , director of Security Solutions for Red Hat .
VPNs , telecommuting , connected PDAs and ubiquitous WiFi are all helping to drive this continued blurring .
This means that the concerns of a home user , while on a different scale , are often the same as the enterprise IT manager responsible for protecting thousands of users , business processes and data , he said .
“ What home users must be aware of is the level of risk they are willing to take , ” he told LinuxInsider .
The role of the CIO / CISO is much more than determining which technologies need to be deployed to protect the environment .
“ It is now inclusive of what level of risk the enterprise can accept .
Home users must now make a lot of the same decisions , ” he noted .
“ Education about malicious Web sites and identity theft via spyware will help those home users understand what level of risk they are taking when online . ”
Dick DeVillers , vice president of technology for security software firm Symark , sees a relationship between home Linux users who need less security add ons and enterprise Linux users .
One of the biggest concerns that needs to be addressed , he said , is that security should be considered a process of protecting an entire computing environment , not just one platform .
“ Even home users now have multiple operating systems and appliances such as set - top boxes and WiFi enabled gaming consoles .
This means that security must be addressed by looking at the value which everything on your network provides and protecting it , ” declared DeVillers .
Linux security is more than just a me-only concern .
“ Certainly we believe that Linux and the open source community are exceptionally aggressive in building new technologies and being responsive to issues when they do appear , ” he added .
“ But end users , regardless of home or enterprise focus , must continue to remain vigilant and cognizant of their entire infrastructure and level of risk they are taking . ”
Applying Security
To that end , Linux users can find a limited assortment of add - on security products to ensure that security threats are not an issue .
Antivirus and antispyware applications on Linux are available both in open source projects such as Clam Antivirus and several third - party vendors such a F - Prot , AVG Internet Security and Vira AntiVir Personal Edition Classic .
Even without third - party virus protection , Linux is more resilient to attacks to Windows computers .
Ferris noted that Linux has some inherent capabilities which provide protection from intrusions both before and after they occur .
For instance , Native Type Enforcement ( via SELinux ) is now a core part of Linux , and isolates applications via security policy to limit the damage that can be done by malicious software or users .
Another example is Execshield , which protects against memory buffer overflow exploits .
“ These technologies are proactive approaches to changing the way whole categories of security attacks are addressed , rather than only looking at existing exploits and eliminating specific attack profiles , ” said Ferris .
Different Attackers
With Linux , the security concerns are not so much from outside assaults as with the Windows OS , DeVillers explained .
Linux is unbothered by Windows - type exploits .
It is the threats from within the organization using the computer that presents the greatest risk .
To prevent problems like that , you need control and authorization protection .
“ Security issues when using Linux in an enterprise environment are easily covered by IT services .
However , desktop users in a small business or home situation should make sure they have the basics covered so they are not bothered by a security lapse , ” advised DeVillers .
He suggested individual Linux users lock up the Internet ports by activating a firewall .
If the Linux distribution in use lacks one , he recommended using the package manager applet to get and install the open source FireStarter firewall .
A second security step is to have a password management tool activated and a boot password required for the computer .
Introduction
In user interface design , a modal window ( sometimes referred to as a modal dialog ) is a window that blocks input to other windows .
It has to be closed before the user can continue to operate the application and are frequently an element of Multiple Document Interface ( MDI ) applications or desktop applications like Windows or OS X .
One of their purposes is to prevent the software from being operated in an ambiguous state .
While researching the best way to recreate a modal window for our current project , we ran into Lokesh Dhakar ’s lightbox.js and we knew we found a winner delivery container .
Dhakar ’s method , however , while fantastic , was a bit too specific for our purposes and so we created our own implementation that we think is a bit more flexible for extending a web site ’s interface .
In this tutorial , we ’ll take a look at how to create a modal window using some nifty JavaScript and CSS .
See it in Action
Our demo illustrates a few of the possibilities available to a developer using our Lightbox Gone Wild Script .
Just click on the links to see how lightbox can be used to provide additional info , show an image or present a form for user input .
Lightbox makes it easy to extend a web application ’s interface without having to add clutter .
Implementation
For those of you at work wanting to impress the boss , here ’s the low down on getting the script working .
After a quick walkthrough , we ’ll take a look at the JavaScript and CSS files that make it all tick .
Download the Code
Note :
This demo and the tutorial that follows use the Prototype.js framework .
You ’ll find a compressed version of Prototype in the zip file above .
Include the Files
Upload the lightbox.css , lightbox.js and prototype.js files into your web directory and include them in the head of your html document like so :
< link rel=" stylesheet " href="css/lightbox.css " type =" text/css " /> < script src=" scripts/prototype.js " type =" text / javascript " ></ script > < script src=" scripts/lightbox.js " type =" text / javascript " ></ script >
Apologies if you ’re not a Prototype fan , but it saves a lot of time around here and it ’s our flavor of choice .
Obviously , you ’re always free to reverse engineer any Prototype class into normal JavaScript .
Create some Lightboxes
Create an external document that contains the markup for whatever you want to be loaded into a lightbox .
For example , we created a file called text .html and included the following markup :
< h3 > What is a Lightbox ?</h3 >< p class = " highlight " >
Lightbox is an unobtrusive script used to overlay content on the current page .
Because it places content above your current page , it frees you from the constraints of the layout , particularly column widths .
</ p>
Because we ’re just inserting the HTML snippets into the lightbox you could display a login form , a photo , additional settings for your web app , help documentation , etc .
The possibilities are endless .
Activating Lightbox
To call your lightbox interface , just link to the external file and set the class to lbOn .
< a href= " form.html " class = " lbOn " >
Email This </a>
Deactivating Lightbox
If you want people to be able to close the lightbox after it ’s open , include a link with class lbAction and a rel of deactivate in the external file :
< a href= " # " class = " lbAction " rel= " deactivate " >
Close Lightbox .</a>
Linking to a Another Lightbox within a Lightbox
If you want to load a different lightbox within an already open lightbox set the rel attribute to insert and your href to the file you want to load instead .
< a href=" confirm.html " class = " lbAction " rel= " insert " >
Go to Another Lightbox </a>
And you ’re done .
How it Works
In a nutshell , when the user clicks on a link with a class of lbOn , a transparent div is positioned on top of the webpage to present a visual cue that the attention is now focused on our lightbox modal window .
After the overlay is set , a div ( lightbox ) is positioned on top of the transparent overlay and loaded with information the user can interact with .
When the page first loads , our script inserts the following markup right before the closing body tag .
< div id =" overlay " ></div > < div id =" lightbox " > < div id =" lbLoadMessage " > < p> Loading </p> </div> </div >
The overlay div is responsible for holding dimming the rest of the page .
We ’ll be inserting our different lightbox interfaces inside the lightbox div .
Feel free to change the information inside the lbLoadMessage if you want to present something more exciting than just some text .
When the page loads , we ’re attaching the lightbox object to each element with a class of lbOn .
function initialize ( ) { lbox = document.getElementsByClassName( 'lbOn ' ) ; for( i = 0 ; i < lbox.length ; i++) { valid = new lightbox ( lbox [ i ] ) ; } }
One of the differences between the original lightbox .js script and ours is that Dhakar was using JavaScript to determine the size of the HTML content so he could find and fix the position of the lightbox and overlay.png at the center of the screen .
Wanting to move as much of the presentation to CSS , we decided to use position : fixed to center our lightbox so that it simplifies things in all modern browsers .
Unfortunately , “ all modern browsers ” does n’t really include IE6 and below and so we ’ll still have to use some JS to help them out .
In IE6 , there ’s no easy way to stretch the overlay div , which dims our page across the entire content of the HTML document to achieve a position fixed for our lightbox div .
( This is a non-problem in the recent IE7 beta , but until that becomes popularly adopted , we ’ll need to do the following . )
To remedy this problem , we ’re just going to use position : absolute instead in the CSS and hide that we ’re using position : fixed for IE browsers .
#lightbox { display : none ; position : absolute ; top:50 % ; left :50 % ; z - index :9999 ; width :500 px ; height :400 px ; margin : - 220px 0 0 - 250 px ; } # lightbox [ id ] {
/* IE6 and below Can't See
This */ position : fixed ; }#overlay { display : none ; position : absolute ; top:0 ; left:0 ; width :100 % ; height :100 % ; z - index :5000 ; background - color : #000 ; - moz- opacity : 0.8 ; opacity :.80 ; filter : alpha( opacity=80 ) ; } #overlay [ id ] {
/* IE6 and below Can't See
This */ position : fixed ; }
If you ’re familiar with Dhakar ’s method , you ’ll notice that we ’ve decided not to use a transparent png to get our effect and instead use CSS for our transparency effect .
This makes it easier to change the percentage of transparency and the color of the transparency in the overlay CSS rules .
To make the overlay stretch out to the full screen for IE users , we ’ll need to set the body and html elements ’ height to 100 % and the overflow to hidden for those browsers .
prepareIE : function ( height , overflow ) { bod = document.getElementsByTagName( ' body ' ) [ 0 ] ; bod.style.height = height ; bod.style.overflow = overflow ; htm = document.getElementsByTagName( 'html ' ) [ 0 ] ; htm.style.height = height ; htm.style.overflow = overflow ; } ,
To make everything seamless for IE users , we ’ll also use a getScroll ( ) function to find the current position of the scrollbar to jump the user to the top of the page where the lightbox is located ( because it ’s position absolute rather than fixed ) and then use setScroll ( ) to bring them back to their location when they deactivate the lightbox .
getScroll( ) & setScroll ( )
getScroll:function ( ) { var yScroll ; if ( self.pageYOffset ) { yScroll = self.pageYOffset ; } else if ( document.documentElement & & document.documentElement.scrollTop ) { // Explorer 6 Strict yScroll = document.documentElement.scrollTop ; } else if ( document.body ) {// all other Explorers yScroll = document.body.scrollTop ; } this .
yPos = yScroll ; }, setScroll: function( x , y ) { window.scrollTo(x , y ) ; } ,
hideSelects ()
Due to a bug in IE , select elements tend to position themselves on top of the overlay ( on to of everything actually , including flash ) .
To fix this , we ’re just going to hide them .
We ’ve also had some problems with Firefox and Flash 8 .
If you ’re using the latest Flash in your application , you can modify the script to hide them too .
hideSelects : function ( visibility ) { selects = document.getElementsByTagName(' select ' ) ; for( i = 0 ; i < selects.length ; i++) { selects [ i].style.visibility = visibility ; } } ,
The Lightbox Class
initialize ( )
The most important thing initialize ( ) does is attach activate ( ) to the link onclick , which gets the lightbox process rolling .
initialize : function ( ctrl ) { this .
content = ctrl.href ; Event.observe(ctrl , ' click ' , this.activate.bindAsEventListener( this ) , false ) ; ctrl.onclick = function ( ) {return false ;} ; } ,
activate ( )
activate ( ) calls the methods responsible for setting the png overlay , manipulating the scrollbar position , and displaying the empty lightbox div .
activate : function ( ) { if ( browser == ' Internet Explorer ' ) { this.getScroll( ) ; this.prepareIE ( ' 100 % ' , ' hidden ' ) ; this.setScroll(0,0 ) ; this.hideSelects ( ' hidden ' ) ; } this.displayLightbox (" block " ) ; } ,
displayLightbox ( )
The last method called in activate ( ) is displayLightbox ( ) .
This method sets the overlay and lightbox classes to display : block , and makes the png overlay and lightbox visible .
displayLightbox ( ) then calls loadinfo ( ) to populate the empty lightbox div with information .
displayLightbox : function ( display ) { $ ( ' overlay ').style.display = display ; $ ( ' lightbox ') .style.display = display ; if ( display != ' none ' ) this.loadInfo( ) ; } ,
loadInfo ( )
During initialize ( ) , a member variable , content , was created in order to hold a file location .
Using this file location , loadInfo ( ) pulls information into the lightbox .
After the info is loaded into the lightbox , processInfo ( ) is called .
loadInfo : function ( ) { var myAjax = new Ajax .
Request ( this .content , {method : ' post ' , parameters : " " , onComplete : this.processInfo.bindAsEventListener( this )} ) ; } ,
processInfo ()
Responsible for actually inserting the information into the lightbox class .
processInfo : function ( response ) { info = " < div id='lbContent ' > " + response.responseText + " < /div > " ; new Insertion .
Before ( $ ( ' lbLoadMessage ' ) , info ) $ ( ' lightbox ') .className = " done " ; this.actions ( ) ; } ,
actions ( )
If you want to trigger an event inside of the lightbox , create a link with a class ‘ lbAction ’ .
Also , set the link ’s rel to the function you want called inside of the lightbox class .
For example , we often want the user to have the ability to close the lightbox by clicking the cancel link .
deactivate ( ) is the method responsible for closing a lightbox and can be triggered with the following code .
< a href= " # " class = " lbAction " rel= " deactivate " > cancel</a>
actions ( ) makes the previous link meaningful with the following code .
actions : function ( ) { lbActions = document.getElementsByClassName('lbAction ' ) ; for ( i = 0 ; i < lbActions.length ; i++) { Event.observe(lbActions[i ] , ' click ' , this [ lbActions[i].rel ].bindAsEventListener( this ) , false ) ; lbActions [ i].onclick = function ( ) {return false ;} ; } } ,
deactivate ( )
As we saw previously , deactivate ( ) is called when we want to close the lightbox .
deactivate ( ) is similar to activate ( ) , but instead of displaying the lightbox and overlay , it removes them .
Take note that the information loaded into the lightbox must be removed during deactivate ( ) since the lightbox div is only hidden and not removed .
deactivate : function ( ) { Element.remove ( $ ( ' lbContent ' ) ) ; if ( browser == " Internet Explorer " ) { this .setScroll(0 , this .yPos ) ; this .prepareIE ( " auto " , " auto " ) ; this.hideSelects ( " visible " ) ; } this.displayBlock (" none " ) ; }
insert ( )
As we explained in the intro you can easily link to another lightbox from inside a lightbox . insert ( ) is the method which makes this possible and is seen below .
insert : function(e ) { link = Event.element(e).parentNode ; Element.remove ( $ ( ' lbContent ' ) ) ; var myAjax = new Ajax .
Request ( link .href , {method : ' post ' , parameters : " " , onComplete : this.processInfo.bindAsEventListener( this )} ) ; } ,
Conclusion
Well , there you have it .
We believe the lightbox to be a great tool for presenting more information to a user without taking them to a new page or forcing a pop-up .
As I said in the tutorial , there have been some problems with Flash 8 on Firefox and select elements in IE .
If you find any other problem areas , please let us know .
UPDATE 2/2/06 : Kevin just made an improvement to the Lightbox CSS file .
Instead of using a png for the transparency , the script now uses CSS rules to set the color and percentage of transparency for the div .
This will allow for greater customization for those that do n’t want to change pngs everytime they want a different feel or effect .
Via The Huffington Post :
Former White House Press Secretary Scott McClellan was one of the key figures in the Bush administration 's efforts to respond publicly to the investigation into the Plame leak .
He spoke for the White House and he was the filter through which the public learned about which officials were and were not involved in the leak .
Standing in front of the White House Seal , McClellan famously denied any White House involvement in the leak , " If anyone in this administration was involved in it , they would no longer be in this administration . "
We need to launch an immediate investigation to determine the facts of this case , the extent of any cover up and determine what the President knew and when he knew it .
If in fact the President of the United of States knowingly instructed his chief spokesman to mislead the American people , there can be no more fundamental betrayal of the public trust .

Perino blasts NYT presentation -- not content -- of report on White House lawyers discussing CIA tape destruction Nick Juliano
Published : Wednesday December 19 , 2007
del.icio.us |
Print This Email This UPDATE : Times says White House did not challenge content of article revealing four White House lawyers discussed CIA 's plans to destroy tapes , will correct sub - headline White House spokeswoman Dana Perino spent the beginning of her daily briefing Wednesday addressing questions stemming from a devastating New York Times report on the extent of discussions within the administration about the destruction of CIA terror Perino refused to comment on the story 's main findings -- that at least four administration lawyers discussed with the CIA its plan to destroy several hundred hours worth of recordings depicting " harsh interrogation techniques " being used on at least two detainees .
And no one from the White House challenged the essence of the article in behind - the - scenes discussions with the Times , an executive at the paper 's parent company told RAW STORY Wednesday .
" The White House has not challenged the contents of our story , " Catherine Mathis , a senior vice president for corporate communication at the New York Times Co. said in an e-mail , " but it questioned the precision of the second deck of our headline : ' White House Role Was Wider Than It Said . '
While Bush Administration officials have discussed the White House role in the tapes episode ( asserting , for example , that Harriet Miers opposed the destruction of the tapes ) ' the White House ' has not officially said anything on the subject .
We have made the appropriate correction on line , and will print a correction . "
In her daily briefing , Perino echoed complaints she voiced in a written statement earlier Wednesday , saying the sub - headline incorrectly implied that she had willfully misled the press .
The Bush administration mouthpiece insisted , she had refused to comment on any details of the CIA tape destruction , except to say the president only remembered learning the spy agency had destroyed potential criminal trial evidence just before the story became public .
" We have not described -- neither to highlight , nor to minimize -- the role or deliberations of White House officials in this matter , " she said .
Perino told reporters she was assured by Times editors that they would retract the sub - headline and issue a correction in Thursday 's edition .
Several reporters in the room pressed Perino on whether the article was inaccurate in its substance , but she refused to provide any illumination on that issue .
" So you 're disputing that characterization , not the underlying facts of the story , " one reporter asked .
" I am not commenting on the underlying facts of the story , " Perino stressed , maintaining the moratorium on illumination the White House has maintained since the story first appeared nearly two weeks ago .
Times scribes Mark Mazzetti and Scott Shane , who were the first to report on the tapes ' destruction , revealed Wednesday the involvement of four White House lawyers in discussing whether the tapes should be destroyed : Alberto Gonzales , the White House counsel until 2005 ; David Addington , Vice President Dick Cheney 's former lawyer and now chief of staff ; John B. Bellinger , a former senior lawyer for the National Security Council ; and Harriet Miers , who became White House counsel when Gonzales was promoted to Attorney General .
Their report was based on unnamed current and former intelligence and administration officials .
" The accounts indicate that the involvement of White House officials in the discussions before the destruction of the tapes in November 2005 was more extensive than Bush administration officials have acknowledged , " Mazzetti and Shane wrote .
In Perino 's view , that sentence implied she was a liar , but several White House reporters in Wednesday 's briefing pointed out that Perino was not mentioned in early editions of the story and that administration officials had privately told several members of the press only of Miers 's involvement in discussions over the tapes .
" I am not accountable for all the anonymous sources that you turn up , " Perino scolded the assembled reporters .
" This says that I was misleading , and I was not . "
The article was updated on the Times Web site around 11 a.m. Wednesday with Perino 's earlier written statement , which said , " The New York Times  inference that there is an effort to mislead in this matter is pernicious and troubling . "
The Times ' Washington bureau chief reiterated that no one was questioning the contents of the story , and he defended his correspondents reporting .
Dean Baquet , the Times ' Washington D.C. bureau chief , told Politico that while the deck  the subheadline  went a little farther than the story ,  the facts in the piece are accurate .
 Nobody has challenged the thrust of the story ,  Baquet said .
 If they want to quibble with the deck , they have a legitimate point .
But nobody is raising any questions with what the story is about , and what the story said . 
Although the story was written and edited in Washington D.C. , according to Baquet , the subheadline and layout , in typical fashion , were handled in New York .
Mark Mazzetti and Scott Shane , the Times reporters who co-authored the story , could not be reached for comment .
 We stand strongly by the story ,  Baquet said .
The Hadza still live much the same way as ancient humans did
Their finding is based on a group of hunter - gatherers in Tanzania known as the Hadza , who can be studied without bias because they use no birth control .
Males who hit lower notes as they talked had about two more children on average than squeaky speakers .
It fits with observations that women find masculine voices more attractive , the team reports in Biology Letters .
" There are a lot of reasons why lower pitch and reproductive success could be linked , " said Coren Apicella , from the Department of Anthropology in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences at Harvard University , US .
Deep tones are suggestive of increased testosterone levels , which could lead females to perceive such men as better hunters and therefore better providers , she told the BBC .
" Or it could be that men with deeper voices simply start reproducing earlier .
We really do n't know what is behind this yet . "
Sound system
Apicella 's group studied the Hadza because " they provide a window into our past " - they live their lives much as our ancestors did , and their behaviours could illustrate key facets of evolution that might otherwise be swamped by modern culture .
Hadza females gather berries and dig for tubers , while the males hunt animals and collect honey .
Marriages are not arranged , so that men and women choose their own spouses .
The Hadza are monogamous , but extra-marital affairs are common , and the divorce rate is high .
For the study , voice recordings were collected from 49 men and 52 women between the ages of 18 and 55 .
" The experiment was really simple , " said Ms Apicella .
" I went to nine different camps and I 'd just get them to come into my Land Rover and record them saying the word ' hujambo ' , which means ' hello ' , into a microphone .
" I then analysed the voice and pitch , and compared it with the person 's reproductive history - how many children they had had and how many were still surviving . "
The results indicated the deeper the man 's voice , the more likely he was to have fathered more children , she said .
She added that voice pitch was not linked to child mortality .
" We found that for women , the voice pitch was not connected to reproduction . "
' Hadza Olympics '
Because of the similarity which their hunter - gatherer lifestyle bears to that of our ancestors , the reproductive success of the Hadza could be indicative of the way that human beings evolved .
If females are drawn to deeper voices , this would drive selection in the population towards that trait .
In other words , lower - pitched male speakers would become dominant over time .
Apicella continues to study the Hadza people
Her group has plans to extend its study .
It is analysing data gathered from an experiment designed to test whether lower voice pitch in Hadza men really is any kind of indicator of performance .
" I set up the ' Hadza Olympics ' , " she said .
" The tribesmen participated in lots of activities , like archery competitions , racing , hunting , etc .
" I 'm going to look now at these to see if there is a link between hunting success , reproductive performance and voice pitch . "
The research was undertaken with David Feinberg of McMaster University and Frank Marlowe of Florida State University .

World 's most powerful supercomputer goes online ( fwd )

To : cryptography ( ) metzdowd com Subject : World 's most powerful supercomputer goes online
This does n't seem to have received much attention , but the world 's most powerful supercomputer entered operation recently .
Comprising between 1 and 10 million CPUs ( depending on whose estimates you believe ) , the Storm botnet easily outperforms the currently top - ranked system , BlueGene / L , with a mere 128K CPU cores .
Using the figures from Valve 's online survey , http://www.steampowered.com/status/survey.html, for which the typical machine has a 2.3 - 3.3 GHz single core CPU with about 1GB of RAM , the Storm cluster has the equivalent of 1 - 10 M ( approximately ) 2.8 GHz P4s with 1 - 10 petabytes of RAM ( BlueGene / L has a paltry 32 terabytes ) .
In fact this composite system has better hardware resources than what 's listed at http://www.top500.org for the entire world 's top 10 supercomputers : BlueGene /L : 128K CPUs , 32TB Jaguar : 22 K CPUs , 46TB Red Storm : 26 K CPUs , 40TB BGW : 40 K CPUs , 10TB New York Blue : 37 K CPUs , 18TB ASC Purple : 12 K CPUs , 49TB eServer Blue Gene : ?
Abe : 10 K CPUs , 10TB MareNostrum : 10 K CPUs , 20GB HLRB-II : 10 K CPUs , 39GB
This may be the first time that a top 10 supercomputer has been controlled not by a government or megacorporation but by criminals .
The question remains , now that they have the world 's most powerful supercomputer system at their disposal , what are they going to do with it ?
And I wonder what the LINPACK rating for Storm is ?

So far , Mr. López Obrador ’s supporters have made up the bulk of the people going to the film .
For many of them it has only confirmed what they felt in their gut last year .
“ I always have thought there was fraud , ” said Sandra Quiñones , a 36 - year - old city employee , who saw the film in Mexico City .
“ I would have thought that as a documentary it was boring .
But , no , on the contrary , the truth is you come out angry , the great anger of knowing they stole the presidency . ”
Others with different political leanings remain in quiet thought long after the film has ended .
“ I voted for Calderón , ” said Araceli Pliego , 23 , a student , as she left a Mexico City theater .
“ At the time , I liked his proposal and I still say he ’s not bad as a governor , but after seeing the film , I have a lot of doubts about what happened last year . ”
The film does not present new evidence of fraud .
But it does assemble for the first time a chronology of all the factors leading to Mr. López Obrador ’s defeat .
It also shows how election officials rigidly interpreted the law to prevent a wider recount .
The spine of the film is a long interview with Mr. López Obrador in which he contends that an oligarchy of business leaders that has ruled Mexico for generations did everything possible to keep him out of office .
He also admitted , for the first time , that he had misjudged the power of the negative advertising against him .
Mr. Calderón declined to be interviewed by the filmmakers .
The film also presents images suggesting dirty tricks .
At some polling places , ballot boxes were apparently opened illegally ; at others , more ballots were apparently cast than there were voters on the lists .
The film falls short , however , of demonstrating that the problems were extensive enough to nullify the results .
The courts found the irregularities cut both ways and were not numerous enough to change the outcome .
WATERLOO , Sierra Leone —
Although the rainy season was coming on fast , Zainabu Sesay was in no shape to help her husband .
Ditches had to be dug to protect their cassava and peanuts , and their mud hut ’s palm roof was sliding off .
But Mrs. Sesay was sick .
She had breast cancer in a form that Western doctors rarely see anymore — the tumor had burst through her skin , looking like a putrid head of cauliflower weeping small amounts of blood at its edges .
“ It bone !
It booonnnne lie de fi-yuh ! ” she said of the pain — it burns like fire — in Krio , the blended language spoken in this country where British colonizers resettled freed slaves .
No one had directly told her yet , but there was no hope — the cancer was also in her lymph glands and ribs .

Oy I had a bad night
< Richad34 >
I could n't sleep , and had no idea what to do .
My parents are still awake , it was midnight , and I was bored .
< Richad34 >
So then I remembered that I had a drama presentation the next class and I played a rich guy so I needed a suit .
< Richad34 >
I take out my suit , and get dressed .
You know , the works .
I even took out my top hat and my cane .
< Richad34 >
Now it gets a little weird .
I had to go downstairs in order to see how I looked as it's the only place with a full body mirror .
My parents sleep on the same floor as me so I did n't want to wake them up .
< Richad34 >
So I got this idea .
I decided to turn on my TV so that my parents thought people were talking outside , and my footsteps would be noises they were making .
I thought it would work , I was tired .
< Richad34 > I ran downstairs , checked myself out .
I looked fine , so I went back into my room
< Richad34 >
Now by then the running in a suit had made me kind of itchy ( down south ) , so I quickly undo my pants and release what was stuck and to relieve my itch with my hand .
< Richad34 >
And my mom opens the door to the room and all I do is freeze in surprise
< Richad34 >
I do n't know what she was thinking , but I can tell you the following
< Richad34 >
It was midnight , I was in a suit and top hat , and I appeared to be jacking off to George from Seinfeld .
< Richad34 >
And my mom just stood there in disbelief
< Richad34 >
I can't tell you what ensued , but it involved attempted exorcism and lots of crying
< Richad34 >
Best night ever
NEW YORK ( Reuters Life ! ) -
Surfing the net has become an obsession for many Americans with the majority of U.S. adults feeling they cannot go for a week without going online and one in three giving up friends and sex for the Web .

A survey asked 1,011 American adults how long they would feel OK without going on the Web , to which 15 percent said a just a day or less , 21 percent said a couple of days and another 19 percent said a few days .
Only a fifth of those who took part in an online survey conducted by advertising agency JWT between Sept 7 and 11 said they could go for a week .
“ People told us how anxious , isolated and bored they felt when they are forced off line , ” said Ann Mack , director of trend spotting at JWT , which conducted the survey to see how technology was changing people ’s behavior .
“ They felt disconnected from the world , from their friends and family , ” she told Reuters .
The poll , released on Wednesday , found the use of cell phones and the Internet were becoming more and more an essential part of life with 48 percent of respondents agreeing they felt something important was missing without Internet access .
More than a quarter of respondents -- or 28 percent -- admitted spending less time socializing face - to - face with peers because of the amount of time they spend online .
It also found that 20 percent said they spend less time having sex because they are online .
Cell phones won out over television in a question asking which device people could n’t go without but the Internet trumped all , regarded as the most necessary .
“ It is taking away from offline activities , among them having sex , socializing face - to - face , watching TV and reading newspapers and magazines .
It cuts into that share , ” said Mack .
“ I do n’t suppose their partners are too pleased about it . ”
Mack said a clear trend to emerge from the survey was the increasing need for mobility with people no longer satisfied with just broadband access from home and wanting hand - held devices like iPhones and BlackBerrys .
JWT , whose parent company is WPP , has come up with a new advertising category for people whose lives are so tied up with new technology .
“ We are calling them ‘ digitivity denizens , ’ those who see their cell phones as an extension of themselves , whose online and offline lives are co-mingled and who would chose a Wi -Fi connection over TV any day , ” said Mack .
“ This is how they communicate , entertain and live . ”

Ancient writings from the Dead Sea scrolls are to be read for the first time by British scientists using powerful x-rays .
The team will examine rare and unread fragments of the scrolls , which are believed to shed light on how the texts came to be written in caves along the north - west coast of the sea nearly 2,000 years ago .
The technique will give scientists from Cardiff University a first opportunity to read ancient texts considered too fragile to open .
They will look at the texts using x-rays produced at the £ 360 m Diamond Light Source in Didcot , Oxfordshire .
The machine works by propelling electrons at great speeds around a giant tunnel .
As they corner , they emit x-rays 100bn times brighter than a medical x-ray .
Researchers led by Tim Wess have developed computer software that can " unravel " x-ray images of rolled up parchment documents to reveal the writing , even if the parchment has text on either side .
The scientists have focused their efforts on reading parchments from the 18th century and found that they are able to read 80 % of the words written on documents without unravelling them .
Tests have so far been conducted on legal documents called weedings dating back to 1770 from the National Archives of Scotland .
The team is also set to examine a series of unknown fire - damaged texts recovered from the UK's National Archives in Kew .
Many historical documents are recorded in iron gall ink , a mix of oak apple , iron sulphate and copper , on parchment made from the treated skin of cows , goats or sheep .
With time , the collagen that holds the parchment together degrades and turns into gelatin , damage that is accelerated by the corrosive nature of the ink .
Using the x-ray machine , scientists can examine sheets of parchment in such detail that they can decide how badly degraded they are over distances of one thousandth of a millimetre .
If they are badly degraded , the researchers will be able to use the new technique to read them without risk of destroying them .
The team 's first goal is to read hidden texts from the scrolls and the Torah which is said to record the word of God as revealed to Moses .
" There are some parts of the Dead Sea scrolls that have n't been unrolled , and there are parts of the Torah that have n't been seen as well , " Prof Wess said .
" There are discoveries to be made in terms of trying to understand the whole picture of the history of the people who wrote the Dead Sea scrolls and why they moved into that area of the Dead Sea .
Sometimes we do n't know their value because we can't see inside them , and until we start looking , we do n't know what 's there . "

Many people on the blogosphere have taken note of Andrew Sullivan ’s ode to Barack Obama in the Atlantic .
Sullivan argues that Obama is the only candidate who can break America out of the pro-Vietnam / anti-Vietnam culture war that has gripped America for forty years .
The frontrunners , Rudy Giuliani and Hillary Clinton , whether they like it or not , “ are conscripts in their generation ’s war .
To their respective sides , they are war heroes . ”
I ’m not sure I agree with Sullivan ’s central premise , did I find this supporting argument about Obama interesting :
What does he offer ?
First and foremost : his face .
Think of it as the most effective potential re-branding of the United States since Reagan .
Such a re-branding is not trivial — it ’s central to an effective war strategy …
Consider this hypothetical .
It ’s November 2008 .
A young Pakistani Muslim is watching television and sees that this man — Barack Hussein Obama — is the new face of America .
In one simple image , America ’s soft power has been ratcheted up not a notch , but a logarithm .
A brown - skinned man whose father was an African , who grew up in Indonesia and Hawaii , who attended a majority - Muslim school as a boy , is now the alleged enemy .
If you wanted the crudest but most effective weapon against the demonization of America that fuels Islamist ideology , Obama ’s face gets close .
It proves them wrong about what America is in ways no words can .
This is an argument that Obama himself does n’t make .
Perhaps it ’s because we ’re in highly homogeneous Iowa ( read : 96 percent white ) , but Obama did n’t mention his race once in the time I spent with him .
By comparison , Hillary Clinton mentioned her gender on multiple occasions in the time I spent with her .
The speakers that introduced her often highlighted it .
The closest Obama came to mentioning his race was in response to a question after the third event he did on the day I followed his campaign .
He said that he would be uniquely qualified to resurrect America ’s standing the world because he would “ put a new face ” on American leadership .
He has a grandmother who lives in a small village in Kenya .
He lived in Indonesia .
He can listen to the rest of the world in a way no other politician can , and he can get the rest of the world to listen back .
But never once was the word “ black ” mentioned , nor “ African - American . ”
Maybe Obama is as “ post - race ” as some claim , and maybe that ’s why he does as well as he does .

But he also says Mr Rudd wanted to send strong messages both to the Australian people and the United States .
" To the Australian electorate , he wanted to go to Iraq and say that the troops that he had promised would come out by the middle of next year , will come out , " he said .
" He 's also sending a very important message particularly to the United States - also to Baghdad - that although some of our troops , they will be coming home in the middle of the year , something like 1,000 Australian military personnel will stay in and around Iraq to support the US coalition .

Balkanized North America
What is the most fragmented that North America could have been ?
There are several plausible scenarios ( some based on different patterns of settlement from Europe , others on different fracture lines ) but I chose 1787 as the point of divergence from real history .
In this alternate reality , the westward expansion of the Anglo - American people proceeded pretty much as it did in our reality , but the United States government just could n't keep up .
Every national identity crisis resolved itself in favor of the separatists instead .
Although this is an extremely unlikely scenario to begin with , I did n't want to just randomly subdivide the continent .
I looked for regions which either ...
administered themselves as autonomous nations at some point in American history , or ... shed blood to achieve or maintain their independence , or at least ... threatened to .
Of course , the Native American tribes throughout the continent fit all these criteria , but I limited myself to only three native enclaves .
Chronology :
1775 - 1783
The American Revolution procedes on schedule , and the 13 colonies form the United States of America .
1787 A fire at the State House in Philadelphia kills several members of the Constitutional Convention , including Washington , Madison and Franklin , and the new nation is forced to pass its early turbulent years without its most important leaders .
After new delegates are chosen to replace the old ones , the convention votes to scrap the constitution that was about to be approved , and comes up with another one instead .
1791 Annoyed at the way the new federal government under John Adams is shaping up , Vermont refuses to join the Union , declaring itself an independent republic instead .
1800 France acquires Louisiana from Spain .
1803 Annoyed at the way the USA under President Aaron Burr is treating France , Napoleon refuses to sell Louisiana to them .
Burr plans an invasion .
1804 After President Burr is killed in a duel by Alexander Hamilton , Vice - President Jefferson takes over , and the USA shifts from a pro-British to a pro-French foreign policy .
1812 -15 The USA goes to War with Britain and unsuccessfully invades Canada .
In opposition to the war , New England secedes , but Napoleon , grateful for the assistance , agrees to sell the relatively empty Upper Louisiana to the US .
The area around New Orleans , however , has a large French population by now , and it remains a French colony .
1815 Refusing to recognize the restored Bourbon monarchy of France , Lower Louisiana declares itself an independent republic .
A British force attacking New Orleans is slaughtered by the defending French .
1819 - 37
After many border incidents , the US occupies Florida .
Pockets of Seminole Indians and runaway slaves put up a stiff resistance in Peninsular Florida , eventually driving out the Americans .
1820 Without New England , the free states cannot get enough votes to stop slavery from being allowed throughout Upper Louisiana .
1821 Mexico declares its independence from Spain .
1830 The US expels the eastern Indian tribes to lands west of the Mississippi , settling them in what will later become the Five Nations area .
1835 American settlers in Texas declare their independence from Mexico .
Louisiana intevenes because they are afraid that Texas will join the USA if left on their own , which would leave Louisiana utterly encircled .
Cajun militia reinforces the Texans at the Alamo , stops the Mexican Army and secures independence for Texas , on the condition that it not join the USA .
1837 The Mormons settle on the Great Salt Lake and found the semi-autonomous state of Deseret within Mexican territory .
1837 -41 Rebellions in Quebec and Upper Canada establish independence from Great Britain .
1846 American settlers in Oregon petition for annexation to the US , but the slave states vote the request down .
Instead , the Oregonians establish a sovereign government themselves .
1849 Gold is discovered in California .
Immigrants from all over the world pour in .
1852 Working in secret alliance , California and Deseret declare their independence from Mexico , while Texas pushes its border from the Nueces to the Rio Grande .
Three armies ( one from each ally ) converge on Santa Fe , but Mexico manages to beat back these amatuer militias , holding onto New Mexico .
Mexico , however , is forced to recognize the new nations .
1860 Although the free state voting block had been weakened by the secession of New England , the slave state voting block had not been boosted by the addition of Texas , Louisiana and Florida .
As most of the new states carved out of Upper Louisiana ( Iowa , Kansas and Minnesota ) had been settled by free - soilers , the southerners are only one state away from losing control of the Senate .
The House of Representatives has already shifted to a free state majority , and with the election of Abraham Lincoln of the abolitionist Republican Party to the presidency , the south fears that slavery may soon be abolished altogether .
The South secedes .
1861-63 Lacking the manpower and industrial muscle of New England , the USA fails to reconquer the South .
In fact , New England is selling the CSA all the weapons it wants .
Taking advantage of the crisis , the Five Nations of Indian Territory also declare their independence from the USA .
1870 - 2 Heavy - handed attempts by the Canadians to assert control over the interior provoke a revolt among the metis , the French / Native inhabitants of the Red River region .
1876 Custer 's command is wiped out by the Sioux and Cheyenne at the Little Bighorn River .

Dan Abrams began a new series Monday chronicling the politicization of the Civil Rights Department of the DOJ under George W. Bush .
Politicization would be a polite euphemism for turning the very basis for the creation of a Civil Rights Department inside out .
And like everything else about the Bush Administration , it appears its sole focus is to operate on a strictly partisan basis and without regard to competency .
This is a subject that has been tirelessly investigated by blogs like BradBlog ( See here , here , here , here , and here ) , TPMMuckraker ( See here , here , here , here and here ) and Greg Palast , so it 's about time this got some MSM attention .
My HUGE thanks to Heather for the videos and links .
For more than four decades , Bill Bass has been one of the top death experts in the United States .
He 's best known for developing the Body Farm , a 2.5 - acre plot of land in Tennessee filled with some 150 corpses in various states of decay .
The farm – officially known as the Forensic Anthropology Research Facility – allows scientists to study decomposition and make better estimates of time of death in criminal cases .
In an interview with Wired News , the 79 - year - old forensic anthropologist and co-author of the new book Beyond the Body Farm described the lessons learned from his seemingly macabre corpse farm , and previewed his upcoming exhumation of the world 's greatest escape artist .
Wired News :
What is at the Body Farm ?
Bill Bass :
We have clothed and unclothed bodies , in the sun and the shade , in water .
They 're in automobiles , trunks of cars , houses .
What we 've tried to do is reconstruct as many situations in which police find skeletal remains as possible .
WN : How good could forensic scientists get at estimating time of death ?
Bass :
I 'd hope that we could get to the stage that after looking at everything in the body , we could tell you within a half - day how long that individual has been dead .
The further out you get , the range gets wider and wider .
If you find an individual that 's been dead a year , you might be able now to say , well , that individual has been dead between six months and a year - and - a - half .
What we 're trying to do is narrow those ranges so we get it down to where it is more specific .
WN : How did you get the idea to create the Body Farm ?
Bass : I taught at the University of Kansas for 11 years and identified skeletal remains , but I do n't remember ever getting a maggot - covered body .
They were always bones .
Then in 1971 , I came to the University of Tennessee , and instead of just skeletal remains , about half the first 10 cases were maggot - covered bodies .
In those cases , the police do n't ask , ' Who is that ? '
They ask , ' How long have they been there ? ' "
I did n’t know anything about maggots and thought if I 'll be talking to police about how long somebody has been dead , I 'd better know something about it .
So in the fall of 1971 I went to the dean and said I needed some land to put dead bodies on .
That was the beginning of the Body Farm .
WN : Will the Body Farm grow in the future ?
Bass :
It 's greatly overused .
We have about 150 bodies out there right now , and we need land that has not been contaminated by other burials , by other decays .
We need more land , and talked to the university a while back .
They 've given us another 12 to 15 acres .
It 's going to be about a half - mile away from where the 2.5 acres is now .
WN : Are you learning about topics besides time of death ?
Bass :
We are doing a long - term project dealing with the compounds given off by bodies if they 're buried .
Today if someone is missing , they call out a dog .
But as you and I talk today , we do n't know what the dogs are smelling .
We 've found that there are more than 400 compounds given off by dead bodies .
We can chemically reconstruct each of those 400 compounds , and we 're at the stage where we can bring in the dogs and say , ' Do you smell A or B ? ' "
WN : You also have one of the country 's largest and most modern collections of skeletons , correct ?
Bass :
The ultimate goal of the Body Farm originally was not only to learn what happens in the decay of a body and how long does it take , but also to build up a collection of modern skeletal remains .
The problem with anatomical collections – up until now , there have been three , done by anatomists starting in the early 1900s – is that they 're notorious for having people in the older age ranges .
Most ( specimens ) were in their 60s or 70s or 80s ( when they died ) .
Let 's say you were 80 years old , you died in 1920 and you were in one of these collections .
You were born in 1840 , 20 years before the Civil War .
What you 're looking at are individuals that are older and were born over 100 years ago .
We know there have been changes in population through time .
I wanted to build up a collection of known materials , known by age , race and sex .
We have a little over 700 skeletons in our collection , and we 're building a $ 2 million building ( to house them ) .
It 's something that the university is committed to .
I would like to see it get to the stage where we really have a population big enough to do ( more extensive research ) .
WN : Are people signing up to donate their bodies to the Body Farm when the time comes ?
Bass :
We have over 1,000 people who have willed their bodies , actually their skeletons , to the anthropology department at the University of Tennessee .
Up until 2003 , the most bodies in any one year came from the medical examiners .
We get unclaimed bodies from them .
But in 2003 , the willed bodies surpassed those .
We have a form that you can fill out , and we ask for more information than we did in the past .
We 're asking for medical histories , and we'd like to have a picture of the individual for facial reconstruction .
We 're trying to get better at predicting from the skeleton what that individual would look like .
WN : Is there a holy grail in forensic science , a goal that remains elusive despite technological advances ?
Bass :
The ultimate goal is to get enough data so you can look at any skeleton and make a 100 - percent estimate of the age , sex , race and stature .
I think it may come , that it is a possibility .
It 's a long way down the road , but that 's what we 're all looking for .
WN : For the moment , you have another goal – digging up Harry Houdini .
What 's the status of that case ?
Bass :
There are descendants , and they have agreed to the exhumation to settle some of these theories that are out there .
I 'm a member of the committee that is supposed to exhume him , once they get all of the legal things taken care of .
A book suggests that instead of dying from a ruptured appendix , he was poisoned .
The committee consists of toxicologists , dentists and anthropologists .
The toxicologists will take samples to see if there are any chemicals that should n't be there .
I 'm the one that 's supposed to make the positive identification .
When he was living , he apparently fractured one of his ankles .
Along with other data , we want to make sure there 's a healed fracture to the ankle .
WN : Is there a question about whether the body is really his ?
Bass : I do n’t think so , but you want to make sure that the person is the person you 're supposed to have dug up .
You want to make sure that if you 're looking for Houdini , that it is Houdini .
You do n’t want to do all that and then a year from now hear from someone who says they dug up the wrong body .
Analyst : New NIE shows US intelligence has ' rediscovered its spine ' Mike Aivaz and Jason Rhyne
Published : Tuesday December 4 , 2007

Print This Email This Newly declassified portions of the latest National Intelligence Estimate , which indicate that Iran halted its nuclear weapons program in 2003 , prove that the US intelligence community is finally showing some spine , according to one nuclear analyst .
Appearing on the BBC World news program , Joseph Cirincione ( above right ) , the director of nuclear policy at the Center for American Progress , said that the US military and intelligence agencies were reasserting themselves as President Bush enters the final year of his administration .
Cirincione agreed with the BBC host that intelligence had " rediscovered its spine . "
" And they of course are now dealing with a lame - duck president ... and you 're seeing first the military reassert the integrity of its institutions , and now the intelligence agencies , " he continued .
" So both are now saying ' go slow on Iran , there is no good military option here . '
And now , there is n't really an imminent threat .
We have time to let diplomacy work . "
Cirincione also suggested a change in strategy from intelligence community leadership since the publication of the 2005 NIE , which found that Iran was determined to acquire a nuclear weapon .
" Well , I think what you 've seen is a change in the leadership of the intelligence agencies since the 2005 assessment , and this may be a very good sign that the agencies are now more professional , " he continued .
" The leadership is protecting the analysts from the kinds of political pressure that distorted the intelligence assessments before the Iraq war and up until very recently . "
The new NIE 's findings would severely undermine a case for US armed intervention in Iran , according to the analyst .
" It definitely undercuts the case for military action , " said Cirincione .
" It strengthens the case for direct diplomatic engagement . "
Earlier in the segment , the BBC's North American editor , Justin Webb , said he had spoken with a former top White House staffer who was fuming about the NIE revelations .
" I talked just a few hours ago to a very senior former adviser to the Bush White House , someone who knew about these things when he was there , and he was hopping mad , " Webb reported .
" He said that the rug had been pulled from under the Bush administration , and that the possibilities of the administration being able to take action if it wanted to take action at some point in the future had been significantly reduced . "

Critics pile on columnist for mischaracterizing FISA debate Nick Juliano
Published : Friday November 23 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This Joe Klein is among the most prodigious columnists reflecting Washington 's conventional wisdom on Democratic politics , yet has perhaps the fewest friends in the liberal blogosphere .
His latest effort relies on a mischaracterization of the debate over warrantless wiretapping in order to accuse Democrats of being " tone - deaf " in their approach to national security , and it has not gone unnoticed .
" The article is entitled ' Still Stumbling on National Security ' and contains every 1980 - 2003 cliche about how Democrats better not oppose the big , mean , tough George Bush on war issues or else Rush Limbaugh will attack them and they 'll lose , " writes Salon blogger Glenn Greenwald , who excoriates the columnist for misstating the Democrats ' approach to reining in President Bush 's authority to spy on Americans .
Greenwald , who is well - versed in the debate over the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , assails Klein for essentially arguing that Democrats want to grant terrorist suspects the same right as Americans .
" ' Well beyond stupid ' is a good description for what Klein wrote here .
' Factually false ' is even better .
...
But Klein 's far more pernicious ' error ' is his Limbaugh - copying claim that the House bill ' require [s ] the surveillance of every foreign - terrorist target 's calls to be approved by the FISA court . '
It just does not , " Greenwald writes .
In his column , Klein summed up the FISA debate as follows : The Democratic strategy on the FISA legislation in the House is equally foolish .
There is broad , bipartisan agreement on how to legalize the surveillance of phone calls and emails of foreign intelligence targets .
The basic principle is this : if a suspicious pattern of calls from a terrorist suspect to a U.S. citizen is found , a FISA court warrant is necessary to monitor those communications .
But to safeguard against civil - liberty abuses , all records of clearly nontargeted Americans who receive emails or phone calls from foreign suspects would be , in effect , erased .
Unfortunately , Speaker Nancy Pelosi quashed the House Intelligence Committee 's bipartisan effort and supported a Democratic bill that 
Limbaugh is salivating  would require the surveillance of every foreign - terrorist target 's calls to be approved by the FISA court , an institution founded to protect the rights of U.S. citizens only .
In the lethal shorthand of political advertising , it would give terrorists the same legal protections as Americans .
That is well beyond stupid .
Wired 's Ryan Singel , who also has closely been covering FISA , agrees that Klein completely misses the mark .
" The whole debate is about how the NSA wiretaps INSIDE the United States , but Klein can't grasp that simple concept , " he writes .
" That makes it impossible for him to also understand that there are good reasons to be wary of giving intelligence agencies free access to the nation 's communication infrastructure . "
Over at Time 's Swampland blog , commenters joined in on the excoriation of Kiline .
" There 's no point in reading such a column .
It 's just Joe maintaining his ' centrist ' bona fides by spinning bs , " wrote one .
" This is why no one but your beltway butt buddies respects you , Joe . "
It was not the most eloquent line uttered in movie history , and it may have been one of the silliest : “ Greetings , my friend .
We are all interested in the future , for that is where you and I are going to spend the rest of our lives . ”
But the sentiment , as intoned by the celebrity psychic Criswell at the beginning of the 1959 astro - disaster “ Plan 9 From Outer Space , ” was a perfect way to explain the influence that the space race , then in its infancy , was already beginning to exercise on American popular culture and art , from movies and television to architecture and design .
An effect was much more than simply a spillover from the silvery streamlining of the space program .
It was an increasing preoccupation with the future and technology that helped change not only the country ’s look in the 1950s and ’60s , but also , in some ways , its very conception of itself , as if seen anew from space .
The architect Buckminster Fuller , one of the space age ’s most ardent proselytizers , put it much more coherently in his book “ Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth ” : “ We are all astronauts . ”
An influential inquiry into the future of Britain 's abortion laws will begin today amid controversy over an apparent attempt by faith - based organisations to skew the balance of evidence presented to the committee of MPs .
At least eight submissions of written evidence have come from medical professionals who have not disclosed their membership of Christian groups opposed to abortion on faith grounds .
Six of the doctors are members or activists with the Christian Medical Fellowship , an organisation that has given its own evidence to the inquiry .
Suspicion that contributors had not been transparent about their affiliations has led the clerk of the committee to take the unusual step of writing to all those who gave evidence asking them to disclose their links to any relevant organisations .
The committee is examining recent scientific evidence on issues such as the long - term impact of abortion on the mother 's health and whether babies born younger than 24 weeks ( the current limit for most abortions ) can survive .
The inquiry 's terms of reference specifically focus on scientific considerations and not ethical and moral arguments .
Some on the committee are worried that unless witnesses are transparent about their affiliation to anti-abortion groups the inquiry will not be able to properly assess their evidence .
Evan Harris MP , the Liberal Democrats ' science spokesperson , said : " This inquiry is specifically about the scientific evidence not moral or religious arguments and our witnesses need to be evidence - led not ideologically or theologically driven .
The CMF risk undermining the inquiry by getting people called as expert scientific witnesses when they are not . "
Two witnesses who will give evidence today , Chris Richards , a paediatrician and honorary clinical lecturer at Newcastle University , and John Wyatt , a neonatal paediatrician at University College London , are members of CMF , but did not disclose that on their original submission .
" Everyone is entitled to an opinion but when non-experts are submitting their views about findings they really ought to declare where they are coming from so their expertise and standpoint is not misunderstood , " Dr Harris said .
Professor Wyatt , who sits on CMF 's public policy committee , said : " I 'm basically giving this submission as a private individual not a representative of any organisation .
It does n't seem to me helpful in a way to wish to diminish the impact of evidence according to the personal beliefs of the people who present them , unless one is going to do that across the board ... what we are asking is for scientific evidence to be considered on its merits and avoid a sort of polarisation which so easily comes into this field . "
He added : " The idea that people can give information without people finding out where they are coming from - that there is some attempt to hide - is surely ludicrous in the age of Google . "
In an article in autumn 2005 on the CMF website he wrote that " CMF has played an important and increasing role in making submissions to government and other official bodies , commenting in the Christian and secular media and working behind the scenes through the BMA [ British Medical Association ] , in the Royal Colleges and in parliament " .
His submission to the parliamentary science and technology committee 's inquiry focuses partly on evidence suggesting an abortion increases the risk that a woman 's subsequent pregnancies will be premature .
LOS ANGELES – The May Day MacArthur Park melee , in which Los Angeles Police Department officers clashed with protesters and journalists , occurred because of a series of errors by police commanders , according to a long - awaited report released Tuesday .
Officials said 26 officers are under investigation and could face discipline for excessive use of force during the incident .
The report , prepared by top LAPD officials , highlighted numerous missteps by commanders and officers before and during the confrontation :
• Deputy Chief Caylor “ Lee ” Carter “ underestimated the size and significance ” of the rally , which took place at the end of an immigration protest .
• Commanders did not take advantage of the more than 450 officers available to handle the crowds at the park , relying instead on a smaller group of elite officers who easily became overwhelmed .
• Officers appeared to use more force on journalists and protesters than LAPD policies or the law allow , the report said .
“ It appeared that some of the officers and supervisors in MacArthur Park believed that , contrary to department policy , baton strikes could be used to compel a person to disperse , even if they were merely standing in front of the officers , failing to respond to direction , ” the report said .
• There was confusion among officers about who was in charge , with some officers saying there was tension between Carter and two other commanding officers .
The clash injured 42 protesters , reporters and police and is considered a black eye for the LAPD .
TV footage showed officers wielding batons and firing rubber bullets at reporters covering the story .
Police Chief William J. Bratton has been highly criticized for the way the incident was handled by officers and ordered that officers be retrained in crowd - control tactics .
He also created a crowd - control bureau and bought new technology to aid in crowd management .

POTRERO , Calif . 
The scandal in Iraq involving Blackwater , the private security firm , is a world away from this tiny town near the Mexican border .
But five members of the community ’s planning group are expected to lose their posts on Tuesday for approving a Blackwater training camp on an old chicken farm here .
Results of a mail - in - ballot recall election against the members are scheduled to be announced on Tuesday .
Three of the group ’s nine members have already been removed because Blackwater opponents revealed they had been improperly appointed .
Like many Potrero residents , Carl Meyer , 51 , a local farmer and environmental activist , never gave much thought to Iraq or private security firms until Blackwater came to town last year .
Ever since , he has been opposed to the company ’s proposal for 800 acres of rifle ranges , dormitories , classrooms and an armory .
“ Having them here would n’t be in keeping with our rural character , ” said Mr. Meyer , who has helped organize the recall effort .
“ But it ’s more than that for me .
They ’re not good for our country . ”
In every major conspiracy to cover up government criminal activity , agents of change or naïve " experts " have been hired by the establishment media to debunk conspiracy theories and facts .
Walter Cronkite was trotted out of retirement to host a PBS documentary debunking the conspiracy facts surrounding the assassination of JFK ( which was hardly convincing ) .
In like manner , other programs have been produced at great expense to discredit the charges of government cover-ups in the Vince Foster and Ron Brown murders , the downing of TWA 800 by a missile , and the OKC bombing of the Murrah building .
The professional debunkers use four primary tactics to accomplish their propaganda feats :
1 ) They refuse to mention , much less attempt to disprove , the most irrefutable and damaging evidence .
2 ) They take great delight in debunking only those conspiracy theories that are the weakest or that are planted by other government sympathizers to help discredit the more credible conspiracy facts .
This is what is referred to as a " straw man " argument , where a weak or false argument is set up so that it can easily be knocked down .
3 ) They only select " experts " who agree with the official conclusion .
4 ) They snicker at or mock anyone who believes that government engages in criminal behavior or covers up crimes in collusion with judges , investigators , prosecutors , media heads , and hand - picked commissions .
Worse , they label dissenters as unpatriotic or mentally imbalanced .
So it is with the latest government attempt to debunk the evidence of government collusion in the 9/11 attacks .
For over a decade now , the PTB have used an odd vehicle to do their debunking on a variety of issues - Popular Mechanics Magazine ( a Hearst publication ) .
I suppose they are targeting the back - yard mechanic and auto - enthusiast crowd , who are often prone to accepting conspiracy facts and theories .
In the March 2005 issue , PM magazine singled out 16 issues or claims of the 9/11 skeptics that point to government collusion and systematically attempted to debunk each one .
Of the 16 , most missed the mark and almost half were straw men arguments - either ridiculous arguments that few conspiracists believed or restatements of the arguments that were highly distorted so as to make them look weaker than they really were .
PM took a lot of pot shots at conspiracy buffs , saying that those " who peddle fantasies that this country encouraged , permitted or actually carried out the attacks are libeling the truth - and disgracing the memories of the thousands who died that day . "
That would be true only if there was no basis in fact for these controversies .
I am one of those who claim there are factual arguments pointing to conspiracy , and that truth is not served by taking cheap shots at those who see gaping flaws in the government story - especially when you do n't address the really tough questions in your rebuttal .
Here is a quick run down of the claims ( some lumped together ) and why PM 's debunking was superficial and distorted :
1 ) The bulging projection ( pod ) visible on the bottom of Flight 175 as it struck the south tower
If the bulge is real , critics claim it means the aircraft was modified for the attack , which could not have been done by hijackers .
PM says the anomaly was simply the bulging faring under each wing root which hides the landing gear .
This is a possibility since the bulge viewed on all pictures of Flight 175 is in the same location as the landing gear faring .
However , the bulge is significantly bigger than the actual faring , and casts a shadow on the bottom of the aircraft .
The real landing gear faring is flush with the bottom of the plane and could not cast a shadow on that area .
Besides , I talked to Boeing about the bulge and a woman spokesperson admitted that Boeing had studied the bulge and concluded , " It was n't modified by Boeing . "
She did n't deny the bulge was n't there , nor did she try to persuade me it was the landing gear faring .
However , I do n't have an answer for what the purpose of the modification might have been .
Later PM turns a related claim by a witness ( that there were no windows on this aircraft ) into a major issue to debunked .
This was a straw man issue that was easily debunked with a photo of the plane 's debris , with windows .
This was never a credible issue with most conspiracy theorists .
2 ) The " stand down " order to stop intervention against the hijackers PM cites the existence of a few scrambled jets as proof there was no " stand down " order given .
This is a straw argument because key facts are omitted .
There is other evidence to show that these fighters were called out purposely from bases too distant to make the intercepts - and never engaged afterburners for extra speed , indicating no sincere attempt to intercept .
I received an email from one of the tower operators at McGuire AFB telling me he had received a call from the base commander ordering him to shut down military flight ops and not let fighter - interceptors take off .
This was before the general shut down of the air traffic system by the FAA .
This indicates that aircraft closer to the hijacked planes were told to stand down .
There are two witnesses ( a general and a Congressman ) who said VP Dick Cheney was operating under stand - down orders , except as pertaining to Flight 93 in Pennsylvania .
PM tried to make the case that NORAD had never vigorously followed standing orders to intercept hijacked aircraft , and that their high definition radars were all pointed outside the US boundaries ( like a doughnut ) .
Neither is true .
There were dozens of intercepts in the two years prior to 9/11 ( PM said there was only one ) and NORAD has complete radar coverage within the US .
PM also presented disinformation when it claimed that if an airliner turns off its transponder , the controller can no longer distinguish the aircraft from thousand of other smaller blips on his screen .
Not so .
First , there are n't thousands of unlabeled blips on the screen in any given sector , and second , the actual radar return is still on the screen at the same approximate position of the transponder data symbol , making it easier to acquire .
PM neglected to mention the more powerful evidences of cover - up and collusion here , including the FAA 's destruction of the tape recording of air traffic controllers ' description of the events , the FAA refusing to turn over tape recordings of the ATC controllers talking to the pilots when the hijackings were declared , and the discrepancies between the claims of when the FAA supposedly notified NORAD .
3 ) Explosives brought down the twin towers ( puff of dust , etc . )
This is only a partial straw man argument .
There is significant evidence that the aircraft impacts did not cause the collapse , but PM only discussed the fire and explosive claims that were easily explained away .
An early claim making the rounds was that the towers could n't have collapsed since fuel does n't burn hot enough to melt steel .
PM correctly pointed out , as I have also in my briefs , that steel trusses supporting the floor system only need be heated to the point of sagging - not melting - in order to give way .
Early conspiracists claimed that the puffs of smoke coming out of the windows as each floor pancaked down on another were evidence of demolition charges .
Once again , PM correctly pointed out that the crushing of sheet rock interiors can cause this .
I was never convinced of controlled demolition myself , since it would have required months of prep work inside the building , unbeknownst to all the tenants .
But conspicuously absent from the PM arguments was the blockbuster evidence that the 42 main pillars in the central core of the building had been taken down by a combination of explosives and thermite charges - which can melt steel like butter .
The head of the company removing the debris from the WTC said in an interview that there were large pools of hot molten steel in the lowest basement where the main support pillars had stood .
No expert has claimed that either fuel or burning debris falling into an oxygen starved basement would have been capable of creating the huge quantity of concentrated heat needed to melt 42 huge pillars with two - foot - thick steel walls .
Numerous witnesses and fire fighters heard large explosions in the lower section of the building just prior to the collapse .
One video shot of the south WTC ( whose central core was not even damaged by Flight 175 ) gives clear evidence of the central core being collapsed prior to the general collapse : the center mounted TV towers started descending downward well prior to the outer section of the building .
PM was silent on these major anomalies , and so was the 9/11 Commission , which indicates they were avoiding the tough issues .
PM did attempt some sleight of hand , with some remarks by a paid " expert " trying to explain away the symmetrical and absolutely vertical collapse of WTC building # 7 that was only slightly damaged on one side .
A video of the collapse does show the telltale signs of explosive demolition on each floor - which would have been impossible if the building was heeling over toward the damaged side .
4 ) The Pentagon crash PM discussed the common arguments against the official version : the penetration hole was too small ; there was not enough debris outside ; windows close to the impact were still intact .
The window argument was a straw man with an easy explanation - they were reinforced security glass .
The issues of the penetration hole and the lack of large pieces of debris simply do not jive with the official story , but they are explainable if you include the parking lot video evidence that shows a huge white explosion at impact .
This cannot happen with an aircraft laden only with fuel .
It can only happen in the presence of high explosives .
Some witnesses saw a smaller aircraft , others saw the Boeing .
One or two saw and heard a missile launch .
Could all three have been present ?
I think so .
There are credible witnesses who saw many small pieces of aluminum scattered about , plus a few larger pieces .
If the larger Boeing was blasted apart at impact with high explosives it would explain the shower of aluminum shards that littered the road .
The Pentagon parking lot video tape ( which strangely fails to show a large Boeing aircraft ) does show a huge white explosion - the unique sign of high explosives .
An aircraft laden only with fuel gives off the red and black signature only - nothing white or bright .
If the Boeing was laced with explosives , it would also explain why the wings did n't totally penetrate the structure .
I have checked the photographs of major engine and landing gear pieces among the wreckage and they do match the Boeing aircraft , so I do think a Boeing hit the Pentagon .
But I am not buying PM 's statement ( given without any evidence or photos ) that a landing gear was responsible for the 12 - foot round hole that penetrated three rings of the Pentagon .
The landing gear is a long , gangly affair , and it did n't even make it through the first ring , according to photos I have seen .
Only a missile could have penetrated that far .
Was a missile on the smaller jet seen by witnesses used to prep the hardened Pentagon façade ?
PM 's glib explanations did not do justice to the multiple possibilities .
Besides , if the government version is true , why is the FBI refusing to turn over the two video surveillance tapes ( one from a gas station and one from a hotel ) that would show what really happened ?
5 ) Flight 93 was shot down by an F - 16 PM discussed all the key issues : a small white private jet that was shadowing the flight ; engine parts apart from the main wreckage ; debris two miles away in Indian Lake ; and the purported identity of the F - 16 pilot .
But in each case , it falsified the evidence by quoting erroneous , distorted or planted theories by government experts .
For example , while it finally acknowledged the presence of a white unmarked jet , it claimed it was a private jet flying at 30,000 feet , asked to descend from high altitude and check out the crash .
This was impossible as witnesses saw the plane before the crash .
PM even claimed to have talked to the company ( which conveniently did n't want to be named ) that owned the jet .
But this is at variance with prior admission by a leasing company that said the jet was theirs and was leased to the government ( the CIA often uses white unmarked jets ) .
This story by PM was a total fabrication .
I have listened to the private transcripts of the radio talk between Cleveland Center and all the other airliners controlled by ATC in that sector ( including Flight 93 ) .
Even the 9/11 commission refused to address this private tape , which was recorded by one private jet that was in the area , and is still available on the internet .
Nowhere in that transcript is any private aircraft asked by Cleveland Center to follow or descend with Flight 93 .
In fact , the one airliner that was closest to Flight 93 was asked by Cleveland Center to verify visually the condition of Flight 93 after the Center and all other aircraft on that frequency heard the pilot of the aircraft announce that " there was a bomb on board . "
The aircraft acknowledged seeing Flight 93 in the distance and then suddenly announced that he observed an explosion .
This was while Flight 93 was at altitude , confirming reports from ATC controllers who had vectored an F - 16 to Flight 93 , and witnesses who saw the shoot down from the ground .
It also explains why one of the engines was found miles away .
PM tried to divert its readers from the issue by telling about another part of the engine found about 300 meters from the crash site - which is explainable , if you do n't address the issue of the other engine .
Many witnesses saw streams of papers , luggage and even body parts falling some distance from the crash site .
PM blamed this on an updraft - but luggage and body parts do n't blow two miles away in a gentle breeze .
Lastly , the issue on the identity of the pilot of the F - 16 ( a Major Gibbons ) is problematic .
The source is a retired Colonel Donn de Grand - Pre , who makes many claims about hobnobbing with big wigs in Washington that I find uncredible and suspicious .
He claims he was at an awards ceremony in North Dakota when Major Gibbons was supposedly awarded a medal for shooting down Flight 93 .
I always found this a little fantastic .
Why would the government give out a public award for something they were trying to keep secret ?
The government still does n't admit to shooting down Flight 93 , let alone disclose who did it .
Of course , if they did allow a private awards ceremony , it would explain why they would have Major Gibbons deny it .
While PM 's debunking of the Gibbons story may be true ( they claim he was using his F - 16 to pick up a big - wig in Montana ) , their explanation was also a bit fantastic : people have to be trained in ejection seat procedures prior to flying in a high performance jet .

Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd , on a surprise visit to Baghdad today , assured Iraq of a long - term partnership but stressed his combat troops deployed here would head home by June next year .
" Earlier today I visited Australian battle group in Talil ( southern Iraq ) and spoke directly to what is a fine body of men and women , '' Mr Rudd told a Baghdad news conference with his counterpart , Nouri al - Maliki .
" That battle group will come to a conclusion as of June next year .
And that will be the last battle group we deploy . ''
A floating wind turbine that its makers claim could significantly boost the renewable energy sector was officially launched at a trade show in the German capital on Wednesday .
Dutch company Blue H Technologies said its invention , which adapts technology used in offshore oil rigs , was a world first .
It will soon go into operation off the coast of Puglia in southern Italy .
Unlike normal offshore wind turbines it does not need to be anchored to the seabed and can be used in waters deeper than 50 metres ( 164 feet ) , depths at which installation costs for fixed turbines become prohibitive .
Some males are so forcefully pursued by pushy females that they refuse the advances of previous partners .
According to research published in the journal Current Biology , this helps males conserve their sperm for the possibility of mating with new females .
It therefore increases the chances of fatherhood with the widest possible number of partners .
It is not uncommon to see males collapsing with exhaustion as the demands of the females get too much for them
Dr Jakob Bro-Jorgensen , ZSL
Dr Jakob Bro-Jorgensen , the scientist conducting the Zoological Society of London ( ZSL ) research , said : " In cases where the male antelope was free to choose between females , he deliberately went for the most novel mate , rather than the most high - ranking . "
He added : " However , some pushy females were so aggressive in their pursuit of the male that he actually had physically to attack them to rebuff their advances . "
The research was undertaken in the Masai Mara area of Kenya , in the traditional breeding grounds of the topi .
Copious copulations
Females are fertile for a single day only .
The topi antelope ( Damaliscus lunatus jimela ) come together once a year , for just over a month to mate .
Dr Bro-Jorgensen said : " It is not uncommon to see males collapsing with exhaustion as the demands of the females get too much for them . "
He observed that each female would mate , on average , with four males , while some reached 12 different partners .
And each individual would be mated with approximately 11 times , although one pair was observed together on 36 occasions .
" [ The females must ] ensure that they become pregnant , and preferably with a hotshot male , so they must focus all their energies on ensuring that males mate with them in that time , " Dr Bro-Jorgensen explained .
Unexpected behaviour
These findings are contrary to conventional sexual selection theory which says males are competitive and females are choosy .
Talking to the BBC News website , Dr Bro-Jorgensen said : " We may not have our eyes open to the fact that opposite sexual conflicts may occur more commonly than we think .
Normally , males are persistent and females resistant .
What I saw in African topi was unexpected . "
The synchronised mating activity , and the species ' promiscuity , makes males the limited resource and females the competitive ones .
It is thought the females are interested in mating with several partners to ensure fertilisation , in case their first choice happens to have reduced sperm supply , or is genetically incompatible with them .

In 2000 , Georgia Tech researchers showed that fluid dynamics theory could be modified to work on the nanoscale , albeit in a vacuum .
Now , seven years later they 've shown that it can be modified to work in the real world , too – that is , outside of a vacuum .
The results appear in the February 9 issue of Physical Review Letters .
Understanding the motion of fluids is the basis for a tremendous amount of engineering and technology in contemporary life .
Planes fly and ships sail because scientists understand the rules of how fluids like water and air behave under varying conditions .
The mathematical principle that describe these rules wave put forth more than 100 years ago and are known as the Navier - Stokes equations .
They are well - known and understood by any scientist or student in the field .
But now that researchers are delving into the realm of the small , an important question arisen : namely , how do these rules work when fluids and flows are measured on the nanoscale ?
Do the same rules apply or , given that the behavior of materials in this size regime often has little to do with their macro- sized cousins , are there new rules to be discovered ?
A propane liquid nanobridge breaks up in a vacuum .

It 's well - known that small systems are influenced by randomness and noise more than large systems .
Because of this , Georgia Tech physicist Uzi Landman reasoned that modifying the Navier - Stokes equations to include stochastic elements – that is give the probability that an event will occur – would allow them to accurately describe the behavior of liquids in the nanoscale regime .
Writing in the August 18 , 2006 , issue of PRL , Landman and post doctoral fellow Michael Moseler used computer simulation experiments to show that the stochastic Navier - Stokes formulation does work for fluid nanojets and nanobridges in a vacuum .
The theoretical predictions of this early work have been confirmed experimentally by a team of European scientists ( see the December 13 , 2006 , issue of Physical Review Letters ) .
Now , Landman and graduate student Wei Kang have discovered that by further modifying the Moseler - Landman stochastic Navier - Stokes equations , they can accurately describe this behavior in a realistic non-vacuous environment .
" There was a strong opinion that fluid dynamics theory would stop being valid for small systems , " said Landman , director of the Center for Computational Materials Science , Regents ' and Institute professor , and Callaway chair of physics at the Georgia Institute of Technology .
" It was thought that all you could do was perform extensive , as well as expensive , molecular dynamic simulations or experiments , and that continuum fluid dynamics theory could not be applied to explain the behavior of such small systems . "
The benefit of the new formulations is that these equations can be solved with relative ease in minutes , in comparison to the days and weeks that it takes to simulate fluid nano structures , which can contain as many as several million molecules .
Equally difficult , and sometimes even harder , are laboratory experiments on fluids in this regime of reduced dimensions .
In this study , Landman and Wei simulated a liquid propane bridge , which is a slender fluid structure connecting two larger bodies of liquid , much like a liquid channel connecting two rain puddles .
The bridge was six nanometers in diameter and 24 nanometers long .
The object was to study how the bridge collapses .
In the study performed in 2000 , Landman simulated a bridge in a vacuum .
The bridge broke in a symmetrical fashion , pinching in the middle , with two cones on each side .
This time , the simulation focused on a model with a nitrogen gas environment surrounding the bridge at different gas pressures .
When the gas pressure was low ( under 2 atmospheres of nitrogen ) , the breaking occurred in much the same way that it did in the previous vacuum computer experiment .
But when the pressure was sufficiently high ( above 3.5 atmospheres ) , 50 percent of the time the bridge broke in a different way .
Under high pressure , the bridge tended to create a long thread and break asymmetrically on one side or the other of the thread instead of in the middle .
Until now , such asymmetric long - thread collapse configuration has been discussed only for macroscopically large liquid bridges and jets .
Analyzing the data showed that the asymmetric breakup of the nanobridge in a gaseous environment relates to molecular evaporation and condensation processes and their dependence on the curvature of the shape profile of the nanobridge .
" If the bridge is in a vacuum , molecules evaporating from the bridge are sucked away and do not come back ” said Landman .
" But if there are gas molecules surrounding the bridge , some of the molecules that evaporate will collide with the gas , and due to these collisions the scattered molecules may change direction and come back to the nanobridge and condense on it . "
As they return they may fill in spaces where other atoms have evaporated .
In other words , the evaporation - condensation processes serve to redistribute the liquid propane along the nanobridge , resulting in an asymmetrical shape of the breakage .
The higher the pressure is surrounding the bridge , the higher the probability that the evaporating atoms will collide with the gas and condense on the nanobridge .
Landman and Wei have shown that these microscopic processes can be included in the stochastic hydrodynamic Navier - Stokes equations , and that the newly modified equations reproduce faithfully the results of their atomistic molecular dynamics experiments .
" Knowing that the hydrodynamic theory , that is the basis of venerable technologies around us , can be extended to the nanoscale is fundamentally significant , and a big relief ” said Landman .
" Particularly so , now that we have been able to use it to describe the behavior of nanofluids in a non-vacuous environment – since we expect that this is where most future applications would occur . ”

British undergraduates have a poorer grasp of English than some foreign students , a distinguished don claims today .
Dr Bernard Lamb , a reader in genetics at Imperial College London , says those from Singapore and Brunei make fewer mistakes in their work , despite English being their second language .
UK - born students are more likely to produce essays littered with errors , such as " there " instead of " their " , and " bean " instead of " been " .
Many appear to have gone through school without mastering the basic rules of grammar and punctuation , or having their errors corrected .
Even undergraduates with top
Alevel grades who go on to get first - class degrees made frequent elementary slips , he adds .
Dr Lamb is now publishing a diary of student howlers in an attempt to shame " complacent " education ministers into raising the standard of written English .
A summary of the list - which originally ran to 24 sheets of A4 - sized paper - will be published in the next issue of the Queen 's English Society journal , Quest .
Dr Lamb said : " All these students have good or excellent A - levels or their equivalents .
" The overseas students were generally less bad and the worst were UK raised and usually of British ancestry .
" There was little evidence of students being taught the relevant rules at school , or of the students having been corrected for obvious and frequent errors .
Many did not even regard these errors as important .
" The Government and the educational establishment need to be shaken out of their current complacency about standards of English by constant exposure to evidence such as that presented here from intelligent and highly - qualified undergraduates . "
The list , called Errors In The English Of Highly - selected Undergraduates , is due to be published today .
As well as typical slips , including spelling errors such as " effect " instead of " affect " and " sun " instead of " son " , there were nonsense sentences and howlers which completely changed the intended meaning .
Undergraduates wrote of ' rouge ' genetic elements and plants being " sewn " together .
In one case , a UK - born and educated first - class degree student wrote : " It initats a undisired nonspecific response in mamammals . "
None of the 75 third and final - year students was dyslexic and many had used computer packages designed to spot spelling and grammatical errors .
The checkers , however , cannot pick up wrong word choices .
Dr Lamb , who is chairman of the London branch of the Queen 's English Society , said : " There is not enough emphasis on teaching children how to speak and write properly .
Public schools are the only ones still pretty good at this .
" Standards have been going downhill since the 1960s .
Pupils are not marked down because of bad grammar , but they should be .
" The rot thus extends from top to bottom in education , from bureaucrats to schools . "

But now a restive contingent of our tribe is convinced that it can shed light on traditional philosophical problems by going out and gathering information about what people actually think and say about our thought experiments .
The newborn movement ( “ x - phi ” to its younger practitioners ) has come trailing blogs of glory , not to mention Web sites , special journal issues and panels at the annual meeting of the American Philosophical Association .
At the University of California at San Diego and the University of Arizona , students and faculty members have set up what they call Experimental Philosophy Laboratories , while Indiana University now specializes with its Experimental Epistemology Laboratory .
Neurology has been enlisted , too .
More and more , you hear about philosophy grad students who are teaching themselves how to read f.M.R.I. brain scans in order to try to figure out what ’s going on when people contemplate moral quandaries .
( Which decisions seem to arise from cool calculation ?
Which decisions seem to involve amygdala - associated emotion ? )
The publisher Springer is starting a new journal called Neuroethics , which , pointedly , is about not just what ethics has to say about neurology but also what neurology has to say about ethics .
( Have you noticed that neuro - has become the new nano -? )
In online discussion groups , grad students confer about which philosophy programs are “ experimentally friendly ” the way , in the 1970s , they might have conferred about which programs were welcoming toward homosexuals , or Heideggerians .
Oh , and earlier this fall , a music video of an “ Experimental Philosophy Anthem ” was posted on YouTube .
It shows an armchair being torched .
Can you really do philosophy with clipboards and questionnaires ?
It seems that you can .
Joshua Knobe , of the University of North Carolina , Chapel Hill , is the philosopher who investigated how people responded to those two stories about the company chairman .
( Full disclosure : I examined him on his dissertation . )
You might have supposed that whether we judge an action to be ( say ) blameworthy depends on whether we think it was intentional , and the nature of intentional action is something philosophers have had plenty to say about .
But the so - called Knobe effect suggests that — oddly enough — it may not be clear to us whether an action is intentional until we ’ve decided whether it ’s good or bad .

Philosophers being a quarrelsome group , lots of rival explanations have been offered for what ’s going on , leading to new rounds of experiments .
And to new rounds of arguments over what the experiments show .
Edouard Machery , a philosopher of science at the University of Pittsburgh by way of the Sorbonne , told subjects about a man named Joe who visits the local smoothie shop and asks for the largest drink available .
Joe is informed that the megasmoothies come in a special commemorative cup .
He does n’t care one way or the other about the cup .
He just wants the megasmoothie .
Did he get the commemorative cup intentionally ?
Most people said no .
What if , instead , he ’s informed that the megasmoothie has gone up in price and that he ’ll have to pay an extra dollar for it ?
Joe does n’t care about the extra dollar ; he just wants the megasmoothie .
Did he pay the extra dollar intentionally ?
Most people said yes .
Machery concluded that foreseen side effects of our actions are taken to be intended when we conceive them as costs incurred for a benefit .
In the case of the blameworthy company chairman , then , more pollution was taken to be a harm incurred to gain more profit .
Not so , a philosopher at the University of Utah has argued — bolstering his claims with another battery of field - tested thought experiments .
But even while the experimentalists wrangle over exactly what they ’ve shown ( experimental philosophy is still philosophy , after all ) , their work offers some good cautionary lessons .
Wittgenstein once declared , “ We do in fact call ‘ Is n’t the weather glorious today ? ’ a question , although it is used as a statement . ”
If you actually proposed to do some research to make sure , he would have thought you mad , or impertinent .
Philosophers have always been wonderfully confident in their ability to say what “ it would be natural to say . ”
This confidence , experiments show , can sometimes lead us astray .
Peggy Fossett asked the court to set in train the distribution of her husband 's assets , which run to hundreds of millions of dollars .
" As anyone can imagine , this is a difficult day for our family , " she said in a statement .
" We will continue to grieve and heal , but after nearly three months we feel now that we must accept that Steve did not survive . "
The search for Fossett was called off in early October , after an intense operation involving rescue planes , ground vehicles and satellite technology succeeded in finding other missing cases from up to 40 years ago but which ultimately failed to locate him .
Fossett went missing on September 3 after he took off on a short pleasure flight from the Nevada retreat of the Hilton family .
He carried only one bottle of water with him , had left no flight plan and was not wearing a watch which acted as a GPS alert that could have notified rescuers to his location .
" Even if Fossett had survived a crash uninjured , which statistics show to be very unlikely , without water Fossett could not live more than a few days , " his friend Mark Marshall told the court .
Court papers said that Fossett 's wealth was " vast , surpassing eight figures in liquid assets , various entities and real estate " .
Fossett made his fortune on the commodity markets before turning to his real passion for daredevil adventures including ballooning and sailing around the world and the 1,150 - mile Iditarod sled race across the Alaskan wilderness .
Putin ’s Landslide
by Eric Margolis by Eric Margolis

As expected , Vladimir Putin ’s United Russia Party won a landslide victory in yesterday ’s parliamentary elections , garnering over 63 % of the vote as of this writing , which will give it 70 % of the seats in the Duma , or national assembly .
The Communist Party won only 11.6 % .
Its leader , Gennady Zuganov , cried foul , claiming the elections were fraudulent , a pretty rich accusation from the party that never held an honest vote in its entire history .
Two other small parties that vote with Putin ’s United Russia gained about 15 % of the vote .
One of them is led by the Russian neo- fascist Vladimir Zhirinovsky .
Liberal , western - oriented parties were shut out .
President Vladimir Putin ’s earthy phrases seemed to have captured Russia ’s current muscular mood .
Reacting to sharp western criticism of Russia ’s parliamentary elections , Putin , playing " Vlad the Bad , " warned western powers not to " poke their snotty noses " in his nation ’s business .
Putin , who has been increasingly outspoken of late , mocked President George Bush ’s double standard in accusing Russia of dubious elections , squashing opposition , and roughing up dissenters while ignoring similar behavior by US ally Georgia .
He could have also added other key US clients like Pakistan , Egypt , Algeria , Iraq , Morocco , Afghanistan , and Uzbekistan .
The decision by the US - backed dictator of Pakistan , former Gen. Pervez Musharraf , to exclude former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif from January elections made Washington ’s rebuking of Moscow look particularly two - faced .
President Putin was right to tell off western critics and limit foreign observation of Russian elections .
Russia is a great , historic power , not some banana republic .
If western observers were really needed to supervise votes in Moscow , Omsk and Kaluga , then why should n’t Russian observers supervise America ’s sometimes dodgy elections ?
For example , in Chicago , where the dead routinely vote ; in Florida , where blacks are turned away ; or Ohio where rigged voting machines gave Republicans victory in 2004 elections .
It would be better if we dropped the pretense that Russia conducts free , fair , western - style elections .
Elections under former US protégé Boris Yeltsin were all rigged or voters bought .
Today , Russian opposition parties have almost no funding , they are excluded from most media , which is largely government controlled .
Parties winning less than 7 % of the vote are excluded , and there is no independent electoral commission .
Sunday ’s vote was really a referendum on President Putin ’s popularity .
Most polls show him with 70 — 80 % approval , making Putin one of the world ’s most successful and admired leaders .
Election returns confirmed this fact , particularly among young Russians .
Former intelligence officer Putin and his KGB old boys network have worked wonders for Russia .
After a coup that ousted the sick , besotted Yeltsin , Putin inherited a bankrupt , demoralized nation subsisting on cash handouts from Washington .
So low did " Weimar " Russia sink , much of its advanced military technology was sold to the US for large cash payoffs .
Thanks to tough management , nationalizations , and rising oil prices caused in part by George Bush ’s foolhardy invasion of Iraq , Russia ’s national income more than tripled under Putin , and the ruble became a hard currency .
Equally important , Putin restored pride and sense of dignity to this fiercely chauvinistic nation .
In the process , he centralized all power in the Kremlin , muzzled the independent press , intimidated opponents , jailed oligarchs , and created a cult of personality .
He ruthlessly crushed the life out of independence - seeking Chechnya , thrilling Muslim - hating Russians by vowing to " kill the Chechen bandits in their shithouses . "
Russians simply did n’t care about the atrocities their soldiers and police committed against the Chechen , whom they branded " terrorists , " any more than Americans cared about the vast suffering they inflicted on Iraq and Afghanistan .
Most Russians could n’t care less about the feeble little liberal parties clamoring for western - style democracy .
It ’s a sad truism that Russians want order , economic progress and national pride , not democracy .
Judo champion , abstemious Putin fits this bill perfectly as the historic " white czar , " a good , fatherly autocrat who is strong , manly , and pure .
To most Russians , " democracy " is associated with the thieving oligarchs who pillaged Russia ’s industries and resources during Yeltsin ’s rule , and the ivory - tower economists who debauched Russia ’s currency , leaving millions of pensioners to starve .
Democracy is also seem by many Russians as a Trojan Horse the US used to assert financial and political influence over Russia , and later in Ukraine , Georgia and Central Asia .
Meanwhile , President Bush ’s policies of ordering NATO around the way the Soviets treated the old Warsaw Pact , pushing NATO to Russia ’s western borders , and the daft scheme to emplace US ABM systems in the Czech Republic and Poland enflamed Russia ’s nationalist passions and reignited its historic fears of western threats .
Putin says he wants to continue leading Russia .
But he is constitutionally banned from a third presidential term .
So does Putin plan to run Russia as an all - powerful prime minister ?
As leader of his United Russia Party ?
Will he become a youthful elder statesman ?
Or will he simply get the Duma to change the constitution ?
He may follow the example of Czar Ivan the Terrible , temporarily withdrawing from public life until throngs of supplicants beg him to return to Moscow as Czar .
Or he could just remain Citizen Vladimir Putin .
The only formal title the great Deng Xiaoping held when he so brilliantly ruled China was Chairman of the Chinese Bridge Association .
But no one doubted for a second who ran China .
Whatever Putin ’s near - term political plans , he clearly intends to restore Russia ’s role as a world power , and to challenge US global domination .
Russia ’s withdrawal last week from the European conventional arms treaty is the latest ominous sign .
President Putin wants to restore the old Soviet Union ’s borders , but minus the Communist Party , which has sunk miserably low public support .
Putin believes Russia ’s vast energy and mineral resources will eventually make it the world ’s leading power .
Only 55 years old , Putin might even live to see this triumphant day for Mother Russia .

The resolution was approved unanimously by the 15 - member council .
“ Afghanistan is one of the most important issues facing the world , because the struggle against terrorism and against extremism in that part of the world is the defining challenge of our time , ” U.S. Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad said .
Renewing the mandate for another year gives the mission and Kai Eide of Norway , the new U.N. special representative in Afghanistan , responsibility for providing “ more coherent support by the international community to the Afghan government ” and for leading the U.N. in “ a strengthened and expanded presence throughout the country . ”
Last week , the U.N. peacekeeping chief called for a U.N. “ course correction ” in Afghanistan to improve coordination of international civilian efforts to help promote peace .
Undersecretary - General for Peacekeeping Jean - Marie Guehenno told the council the international community has been committed and generous , but all too often “ insufficiently united . ”

The monetary gadfly behind the Liberty Dollar , Bernard von NotHaus , declared over the weekend that he expects to be criminally charged over his currency and is vowing " a spectacular trial " that will " put this country 's monetary system on trial . "
Mr. von NotHaus was interviewed by The New York Sun via telephone on Saturday following disclosures that the Liberty Dollar , a gold - and silver - based currency marketed by anti-government activists as an alternative to the greenback , drew the federal government 's scrutiny because the coins resembled official currency produced by the U.S. Mint .
After a two - year undercover investigation of the currency , federal agents last week raided the Idaho mint where the Liberty Dollar was produced and the Indiana offices that served as its marketing headquarters .
Tens of thousands of gold , silver , and copper coins were seized , including a special edition bearing the image of a Republican presidential candidate , Rep. Ron Paul , a supporter of the gold standard .
It is the standard edition of the Liberty Dollar , which features a profile of a crowned Lady Liberty as well as the lettering USA and " Trust In God , " which federal authorities say is illegal .
These symbols and language are similar enough to coinage from the U.S. Mint that the Liberty Dollars " are easily confused with legitimate United States Currency , " a purported affidavit apparently filed last week in support of the search warrant claims .
The apparent affidavit was posted on the Internet on Friday by the libertarian think tank , the Reason Foundation .
A spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney 's office in Charlotte , N.C. , told the Washington Post that a court clerk had mistakenly made court documents in the case public .
Signed by an FBI special agent , Andrew Romagnuolo , the affidavit says the Liberty Dollar operation was in essence a counterfeiting operation motivated by an ideological desire to undermine American currency and to make a profit .
The affidavit claims there is probable cause to believe Mr. von NotHaus , along with his office manager and a North Carolina retailer of the coins , had conspired to pass off the Liberty Dollar as government currency .
Mr. von NotHaus , a critic of the Federal Reserve who retired from a career at a private mint in Hawaii , denied introducing the Liberty Dollar for personal gain .
He said the Federal Reserve is pursuing a ruinous and unconstitutional monetary policy , and is recommending his currency as being inflation - resistant .
" I never took a penny during the first five years and got only a small amount of gratuity over the past five years , " he said .
He declined to say exactly how much money he had made from the Liberty Dollar .
Financial statements from the operation were not immediately available .
But in 2001 , when Mr. von NotHaus put an ad in the Liberty Dollar 's newsletter for an executive director to take over his duties , he promised a salary of " well over $ 5000 cash per month , no withholding . "
The Liberty Dollar , which has been produced since 1998 , has more than $ 20 million in circulation across the country .
Coin enthusiasts and libertarians who support the venture have convinced a variety of retailers to accept the medallions , sometimes by offering it to them at slightly less than face value .
One longtime Liberty Dollar supporter says the venture is largely a failure .
" It never did do what the organization really wanted it to do  become widely accepted as a medium of exchange , " a Liberty Dollar distributor in Michigan who is mentioned in the affidavit , Ron Goodger , said by telephone .
" It 's a tremendous amount of work to get the public to accept something it was n't familiar with . "
Liberty Dollars are circulated across the country through regional agents such as Mr. Goodger , who get to purchase the coinage at a slightly discounted rate .
According to the affidavit , the FBI has managed to sign three undercover employees to sign up as Liberty Dollar agents .
The investigation began in July 2005 and lasted until this month , according to the affidavit .
The affidavit includes details such as how at informational sessions intended to drum up interest in the currency  called Liberty Dollar University  attendees could buy shirts with the wording " The US Mint can bite me . "
Based on the up - close view of how Liberty Dollars are distributed , the FBI alleges that " a multi - level marketing scheme " was in place whose main purpose is to enrich those involved in distributing the coins .
The heart of that charge is that Liberty Dollars are sold for slightly more than the value of the silver and gold inside of the coin .
Until recently , the silver ounce Liberty Dollar was marketed at $ 20 , several dollars above silver 's spot price .
And Mr. von NotHaus was in the process of revaluing it at $ 50 a piece , according to the affidavit .
What the affidavit describes as a " scheme , " Mr. von NotHaus defends as sound economic policy .
" It 's the only way the Liberty Dollar could perform .
Does n't it make sense that as the underlying commodity appreciates in value , the purchasing power should appreciate in value ? "
Mr. von NotHaus said .
" They 're really just opposed to my economic theory .
Where 's the fraud ? "
A 1999 report by the Southern Poverty Law Center said that many of the participating merchants " are run by men and women connected to the radical right . "
Mr. Goodger described the supporters of the currency as " concerned people who believe our government is out of control . "
Mr. Goodger said that as far as he knew no one connected to distributing the currency advocated armed resistance against the federal government .
" In the end all the organization is doing is getting precious metals out there in the hands of the people , and that 's something that 's got to be done , " he said .
" It 's a peaceful operation , " the office manager for currency operation , Sarah Bledsoe , said by telephone .
" We just want the government to give us a better currency , because what we have is not working .
We do n't want another Depression . "
Ms. Bledsoe , who was present at the raid in Evansville , Ind. , is named in the affidavit as part of the alleged conspiracy .
A " John Doe " lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court in Alexandria , Virginia , this morning could be one of the largest anti-spam suits ever filed in the US so far .
The suit was filed by Project Honey Pot , a free anti-spam service that collects information on e-mail address harvesters across thousands of sites on the Internet that have their software installed .
The class - action complaint was filed on behalf of roughly 20,000 Internet users in more than 100 countries , according to the organization 's web site .
Because of webmasters large and small installing its software on their servers , Project Honey Pot has collected information on thousands of e-mail harvesters in the US — people or bots that automatically scan web sites for e-mail addresses and then store them in a database for sale to a spammer .
The organization hopes that by filing the " John Doe " suit , they can use that information in conjunction with subpoenas to find out who the actual spammers are .
The lead attorney in the case is Jon Praed of the Internet Law Group .
Praed has achieved quite the reputation as a " spam hunter " in recent years , as he has successfully represented AOL and Verizon against spammers .
Under Virginia 's anti-spam statute and the federal CAN - SPAM law , Project Honey Pot 's case could result in more than $ 1 billion in statutory damages against spammers .
Although CAN - SPAM has been around since early 2004 , the inability of lawmakers to find or identify the spammers in question has led to an increase in spam over the years instead of a decrease .
However , Project Honey
Pot 's approach could actually yield some results , founder of myNetWatchman Lawrence Baldwin told the Washington Post .
" If they 're successful , I think it will yield some very usable information in terms of identifying who the real miscreants are .
Let 's just hope some of them are here in United States and therefore reachable , " he said .
Project Honey
Pot appears to be fully committed to the fight for its users , and although they acknowledge that spam wo n't go away even if the case succeeds , they hope that the case will help scare spammers in the future .
The organization even says that should it win , it may give back to its community : " Since we will know what Project Honey Pot members provided the data that ends up winning the case , maybe we 'll be able to send them a little bonus , " wrote the company .

At the recent farce of a democratic debate - in an obviously scripted moment - a cosmeticized and coiffed twit of a contemporary , bimbo extraordinaire stepped up and asked candidate Clinton which she preferred , " diamonds or pearls ? " then Clinton , in mock surprise , as fabricated as her over - the - top threats against Iran and sundry , did a little Cosmo - magazine dance of parity concerning the relative value of these shiny stones .
This little tidbit has been replayed ad nauseum in the succeeding days and it perfectly sums up the bankrupt state of the culture ; what those promoting such banality would have us understand the culture to be .
It was a Kodak moment .
Quite accidentally , I am ' so totally sure� ; the in house crowd was stacked with Clinton backers who made strange animal noises of disapproval every time Obama and Edwards chose to attack inconsistencies in Clinton�s positions .
The whole affair was tailored like a cheap suit .
Consistent with the taste of the whole , the suit was assumed to be Armani ; a fraud in mufti in the same way that CNN pretends to be a news channel instead of an unintentional lampoon of the same ; when it is not perniciously serving the interests of its masters .
Except for Kucinich - who mixes strange with truth and makes me wonder - all of the candidates looked about as genuine as a Miss America contestant .
The fix is in and it goes down like Jello Pudding with the same end effect .
Once something becomes a total joke all you need is the looping laugh track and a runaway pig�s bladder .
More and more it all seems as if Rupert Murdoch�s vision of life has become reality .
It �s like dressing up Baron Samedi in the clothes Jon Benet used to wear� one size fits all .
One news channel , all the same channel� all the same lies ; " one ring to bind them all and in the darkness find them . "
Can something that has become such an absurdity ever regain any authenticity again ?
Was it always bullshit ?
Shouldn�t somebody put red noses on the clowns at Mount Rushmore ?
" Not with a bang but a whimper . "
Does the actual meaning of that phrase apply to sex and does the translation work out to the promise of a desired union culminating in the laying on of a lash upon the trembling collective ass desensitized to anything but the revelation of pain promising a pay per view relief ?
They certainly seem immune to what they�ve supported , allowed and turned a blind eye to all along the way .
A good friend of mine in Hawaii said to me on the phone yesterday , in relation to the ' spontaneous � diamonds and pearls exchange , that it sets up a strange counterpoint to the millions who are starving and dying and wracked in innumerable ways ; this loathsome and cloying fascination with baubles .
This is the sum of the American Dream� an obsession with cosmetic trivia� the fascination of a people with cold gems that are coveted by cold hearts � by people who cannot feel .
I listen to Ron Paul speak and the difference between he and they in gravitas and honesty is instant satire .
What are they going to do about Ron Paul ?
My friend said that they are going to have to kill him .
I hope that is n�t true but it does look like they won�t be able to discredit him .
He�s surrounded by psychopaths in his own party and vaudeville clowns in the other .
It �s turning into a combination American Idol B - slasher flick .
I don�t agree with everything Ron Paul says but I don�t expect to .
I�m not an expert when it comes to governing a nation ; much less the most powerful and ridiculous nation on Earth .
Everything I know about government I learned from Lao Tzu and I�ve never bothered to learn more .
He says it all .
However , Lao Tzu�s solutions to the needs of government are diametrically opposed to the bombastic , self interest of the present collection of pandering clowns .
I guess I�ve used ' clowns � a few times already but I can�t think of a more appropriate term .
Every one of them looks to me like they should be running around with a seltzer bottle chasing Clarabelle .
It �s no surprise that the present resident of the White House is also a clown of the John Wayne Gacy variety .
Sometimes I close my eyes and I see a chimpanzee dressed in a summer party dress being chased around the Lincoln bedroom by a tumescent James Gannon in lederhosen ; Karl Rove in the corner with a feather duster up his ass .
What are we to expect from those seeking to replace him who never had the courage to stand forth and say what needed to be said ?
I keep thinking of that line from Apocalypse Now ; " The horror !
The horror ! "
I can�t see where any of this is headed but I know that I don�t want to go there .
It astonishes me ; this ' business as usual� motif that threads it�s way through the increasingly more intense warning signs of wildfires , cyclones , floods , riots , murderous assaults , tazerings , lying disinfo and do I really have to go on ?
Where am I going with this ?
The evidence shows a world in upheaval undergoing massive transformation � politically , socially , in the natural world � no one seems to have a handle on anything and the present leaders of much of the so - called free world are waving the tired specter of terrorism and pushing corporate inspired fascism as a solution , while whatever small - disorganized terrorism there may be is caused by and often engineered by the very forces declaiming it .
It �s a shell game .
Meanwhile Mother Earth doesn�t seem too happy ; whatever the reasons may be .
Think about it .
Bad writers are on strike , as if anyone would miss the septic flow of their input and the industry says that it will get by on ' reality � ( snicker ) shows � it is to weep .
Meanwhile hundreds of thousands are dying in real reality shows but no one is watching .
The price of oil is shooting through the roof and impacting every area of the world�s economies .
Transit unions are striking �
Pakistanis are revolting � thousands of Buddhist monks are buried in the Myanmar jungles and for some reason � you have to laugh �
Chinese manufacturers are soaking children�s toys in GHB � and its business as usual .
Ron Paul is the only sane voice I hear that is also uncompromising .
I don�t generally support political candidates but I know the difference between seeking balance and deliberately seeking imbalance .
I know the difference between reasonable perspective in pursuit of the common good and ruthless efforts for the benefit of the few .
Ron Paul is saying a lot of the right things and his history seems to indicate that he is sincere and informed .
He actually appears to be human .
Dr. No ?
More people should be saying " No. " instead of being Yes - men for any and every oppressor of human good ; every profiteer on the backs of the people .
More people should be saying , " I don�t know . " rather than having answers for every question they get and all of those answers tailored to the fears of the largest interest group they could poll , or the richest minority group whose desires they anticipate
Diamonds and pearls �
Vampires prefer diamonds and pigs trample pearls , so what have you got ?
� Blood - sucking swine ?
From what I can see , Ron Paul represents those still capable of reason in this most unreasonable and selfish culture .
Does he actually represent this in essence ?
How would I know ?
I can see the road he walked to get here and whatever he may truly be he�s a lot more viable than any of the rest .
He�s possibility and the promise of hope .
He�s the sort of man who might well be made great by the power of office .
I think it unlikely that would be true of the others ; the others are bought and sold long ago .
As much as I am impressed with Ron Paul ; if only by comparison with the competition , I am easily as impressed by his supporters ...
I like the sort of people who talk about him .
I like their intensity and intelligence .
I like their independence and I like their dreams as seen reflected in their candidate of choice .
It �s an unlikely event but stranger things have happened .
If by some miracle of circumstance and fate , Ron Paul were to be elected then I think that speaks well for humanity and for the future .
I�d be very impressed .
As far as diamonds and pearls go , I hope in my life that I continue to spend as little time with those who love them as I do now .
I hope one day the value mistakenly given to lifeless trinkets gets put back on the most valuable of life�s creations � one another .
WASHINGTON , Nov 1 ( Reuters ) - Americans spend double what people in other industrialized countries do on health care , but have more trouble seeing doctors , are the victims of more errors and go without treatment more often , according to a report released on Thursday .
Patients in the Netherlands struggle the most with paperwork , while British and Canadian citizens wait the longest for elective surgery , the Commonwealth Fund reports in the journal Health Affairs .
The report , published on the Internet
here
, provides an annual comparison from the Commonwealth Fund , a private foundation that supports research on health systems .
This year it may be especially important as the 2008 U.S. elections are featuring health care reform as one of the most important issues , fund president Karen Davis said .
" The survey shows that in the U.S. , we pay the price for having a fragmented health care system , " Davis told reporters in a telephone briefing .
Harris Interactive researchers surveyed 12,000 adults in the United States , Britain , Germany , Netherlands , Canada , New Zealand and Australia .
Of these , only the United States lacks a universal health care system .
The report said Americans spent $ 6,697 per capita on healthcare in 2005 , or 16 percent of gross domestic product .
All the other countries spent less than half of that -- $ 3,128 in Australia or 9.5 percent of GDP , $ 3,326 in Canada or 9.8 percent of GDP , down to a low of $ 2,343 in New Zealand or 9 percent of GDP .
Davis said the Netherlands is included for the first time and is interesting because of its mix of mandated employer - sponsored , private and public insurance .
STANDING OUT BUT NOT OUTSTANDING
The report found that the United States stands out because of its expense and people 's dissatisfaction .
" The thing that struck me in this survey is the trouble that Americans have in getting to see their own doctors , " Davis said .
Americans and Canadians often go to emergency departments for what should be routine care , the survey found .
" As in previous surveys , U.S. adults were most likely to have gone without care because of cost and to have high out - of - pocket costs , " the report reads .
" In the U.S. , nearly two of five ( 37 percent ) of all adults and 42 percent of those with chronic conditions had skipped medications , not seen a doctor when sick , or foregone recommended care in the past year because of costs -- rates well above all other countries , " it adds .
" In contrast to the U.S. , patients in Canada , the Netherlands , and the U.K. rarely report having to forgo needed medical care because of costs . "
Patients in New Zealand and Britain had the least confidence of getting top - notch care .
German and U.S. adults had the quickest access to elective surgery .
" In most countries , waits of a year or more were rare ; in Canada and the United Kingdom , though , 8 percent reported waiting that long , and 15 percent reported waiting six months or more for elective surgery , " the report reads .
Having a " medical home " -- such as an easily reached primary care doctor who coordinates other care -- seemed to provide the most satisfaction , said Commonwealth vice president Cathy Schoen , who led the study .

What happened ?
Hard Links
Unix is fairly alone in the world with its hard links ( that was a hard link you created in the command line above ) .
Actually the name ' hard link ' is a bit of a misnomer : Unix admits of what might be called ' multi- linked files ' .
Directories contain information about the files within .
Unix directories contain only file names and inodes .
An inode is a numerical index into a control block on each physical drive called the ilist .
All file information - save the file name - is in the ilist .
It 's impossible to backtrack from data in the ilist to a file name .
Any number of file names can point to the same physical storage on disk .
When you issued the ' ln ' command above , what happened was this .
The 'ln ' program looked in the directory ' Desktop ' for the record for ' Picture 1.pdf ' .
This record contains the inode for ' Picture 1.pdf ' .
The 'ln ' program assigned the same inode to ' Picture 2.pdf ' .
If you issue an 'ls - il ' command in the Desktop directory , you will see that the files share the same inode and that both now have a link count of 2 - there are two links to the same inode .
The inode is in the leftmost column ; the link count is right before the owner and group .
553824 -rw-r--r-- 2 rixstep staff 3334 Jun 21 18:50 Picture 1.pdf 553824 -rw-r--r-- 2 rixstep staff 3334 Jun 21 18:50 Picture 2.pdf
Unix needs this link count in the ilist information because it 's going to have to free this storage when the count gets back to zero .
In Unix you never remove a file - you unlink a file name to it .
There 's really nothing more to the whole thing because the design here is so simple yet effective ( some would say elegant ) .
HFS + Hierarchical File System Plus ( Extended or + or even ' X ' ) is an outgrowth of the first commercially available file system for the original Macintosh computer back in 1984 .
It uses a complex ' B - tree ' ( B *- tree ) algorithm for storing file records in what is known as a catalog file .
The catalog file contains three types of records for directories , files , and special ' thread ' records that help the system find its directories and files .
A HFS + file record looks like this .
struct HFSPlusCatalogKey { UInt16 keyLength ; // 16 - bit unsigned integer HFSCatalogNodeID parentID ; // 32 - bit unsigned integer HFSUniStr255 nodeName ; // Unicode string } ;
The first field keyLength gives the length of the record ( which is variable ) ; the second field parentID gives the catalog node ID ( or ' CNID ' ) of the file 's parent folder ( this is 32 - bit and so allows for 4 GB file CNIDs on a file system ) ; the third and final field nodeName gives the file 's name - which may be up to 255 Unicode characters in length .
You can ' backtrack ' with HFS + : given a CNID , you can find the fully qualified ( ' absolute ' ) path to the file name .
Take the nodeName field in the record .
Look up the record for the parent folder 's CNID parentID .
If the parent folder also has a parent folder , look up that parentID too .
And so forth - now put all those names together .
HFS + can do this without a murmur because it assumes there is only one file name per file information record .
But what happens if you suddenly have to support Unix hard links ?
Apple Technical Note TN1150 gives the details .
It 's very complex .
Apple Technical Note TN1150 , HFS Plus Volume Format Hard links in HFS Plus are represented by a set of several files .
The actual file content ( which is shared by each of the hard links ) is stored in a special indirect node file .
This indirect node file is the equivalent of an inode in a traditional UNIX file system .
HFS
Plus uses special hard link files ( or links ) to refer ( or point ) to an indirect node file .
There is one hard link file for each directory entry or name that refers to the file content .
Indirect node files exist in a special directory called the metadata directory .
This directory exists in the volume 's root directory .
The name of the metadata directory is four null characters followed by the string ' HFS + Private Data ' .
\0\0\0\0HFS +
Private Data
The directory 's creation date is set to the creation date of the volume 's root directory .
The kIsInvisible and kNameLocked bits are set in the directory 's Finder information .
The icon location in the Finder info is set to the point ( 22460 , 22460 ) .
The inode number returned by the stat and lstat routines is actually the catalog node ID of the indirect node file , not the link reference mentioned above .
Hard link files are ordinary files in the catalog .
The catalog node ID of a hard link file is different from the catalog node ID of the indirect node file it refers to , and different from the catalog node ID of any other hard link file .
enum { kHardLinkFileType = 0x686C6E6B , /* ' hlnk ' */ kHFSPlusCreator = 0x6866732B /* ' hfs +' */ } ;
There are two types of files in the catalog file : ordinary ' hfs + ' files and new special ' hlink ' files .
The new ' hlnk ' files have records just like their ' hfs + ' counterparts , but they do n't yield their own CNID when questioned ; they yield the CNID of the indirect node file they point to .
All indirect node files are in the folder \0\0\0\0HFS +
Private Data located in the root directory .
As long as a file is not multi- linked , everything is fine ; when it gets its first ' hard link ' some major shuffling is needed .
Create the directory \0\0\0\0HFS +
Private Data if it does n't already exist .
Grab the record for the original file ( and its CNID ) and put it in \0\0\0\0HFS +
Private Data .
Transform the original record from type ' hfs + ' to type ' hlnk ' and give it a new CNID ( and make sure the thread CNID points to this new record instead ) .
Make a similar ' hlnk ' record for the new file name .
And of course HFS + has to switch this all back the day the link count gets back to 1 again .
Remove the record for the file name being unlinked .
Grab the record in \0\0\0\0HFS +
Private Data and move it back ( it keeps the same CNID ) .
Remove the first and only remaining ' hlnk ' record and see the thread CNID now points to the original ' hfs + ' file record again .
Pretty complicated .
So why did Preview screw up ?
Carbon , Cocoa , & NSDocumentController
What 's this ?
Carbon still does n't admit of Unix paths .
Carbon , like MacOS before OS X , wants colons ( ' :' ) as path component separators .
Try putting a colon in a file name through the Finder and HFS will store slashes in the file name instead .
But slashes are illegal in Unix filenames : they 're the path component separators .
Before the HFS driver gives the file names back again , the slashes are converted to colons - if the source of the request is from the ' Unix ' side of OS X that is .
NSDocumentController controls all documents in OS X ( together with NSUserDefaults ) .
When running on HFS+ , it creates records which rely on HFS + catalog file information .
< key>NSRecentDocumentRecords</key > < array > < dict > < key > _NSLocator</key > < dict > < key >
_NSAlias</key > < data > AAAAAAF6AAIAAAxNYWNpbnRvc2ggSEQAAAAAAAAAAAAA

</data > </dict > </ dict >
It is for this reason that a Cocoa document can know immediately when a file name has changed : the _NSAlias lets NSDocumentController ' backtrack ' .
But this system also assumes there is but one file name for physical storage on disk .
If the file becomes multi-linked , the old file record is moved to \0\0\0\0HFS +
Private Data and a new file record ( of a new type ) is written to its own directory to replace it .
And NSDocumentController is thrown for a loop .
This also shows up if two programs edit the same file .
If Unix paths are used , nothing would happen ; but Unix paths are not used - CNIDs are .
When the one editor overwrites the file , the CNID is lost - relegated into oblivion - and OS X cries out for help .
The irony , as any OS X user knows , is that the ' Save As ' button leads irrevocably to the same file name , leading one to wonder why the dialog is necessary .
But NSDocumentController is n't worrying about Unix paths ; it 's worrying about CNIDs .
Bottom Line Not all OS X applications will behave as Preview .
Not all applications are authentic Cocoa applications .
For example , TextEdit ( which is not fully integrated into Cocoa ) will destroy the multi-link when encountering difficulties with NSDocumentController - this with no regard to why NSDocumentController was having difficulties .
Carbon applications may behave even more strangely .
And it is possible to corrupt your hard drive this way - although the test above with Preview wo n't .
It 's also possible to get even stranger results if the file extensions are removed and the files renamed to begin with a dot ( '.' ) .
But NeXTSTEP , the system Apple bought from Steve Jobs , never had this problem because NeXTSTEP ran on the Unix File System ( UFS ) .
HFS was ' retrofitted ' to support Unix because of the ' Macintosh ' legacy .
Can you force a square peg in a round hole ?
Why would you even want to try ?
Postscript : Elvis and the Rat
The name of the deliberately elusive HFS directory has changed .
And so has the method of keeping it under the radar .
The old name was ' \ 0\0\0\0HFS + Private Data '.
The new name is ' ?
\x90\x80?\x90\x80?\x90\x80?\x90\x80HFS +
Private Data '.
But there 's more .
The old name turned up in the directory nlink count .
The new one does n't .
What Apple are pulling here is the old ' zero inode trick ' : the file system sets an inode to zero when it 's completely unlinking a file and prior to actually removing it from the directory .
So Apple give their HFS directory a zero inode - and as it's not in queue for deletion by the file system it remains untouched and ignored by Unix APIs .
And Apple do this for two further files hidden in root : . journal and .journal_info_block .
Elvis never left the building .
CHRISTCHURCH , New Zealand 
In the thousand or so years since humans discovered the remote islands that make up New Zealand , three - quarters of the indigenous bird species have been driven to extinction , and until recently , it looked as if the kiwi could follow .
That would be a loss for the environment , but also for national pride ; the kiwi , a small flightless bird that nests in burrows , is the national bird and has become something of an improbable national symbol .
The country ’s dollar is named after it , and New Zealand ’s residents are often labeled “ kiwis ” by outsiders .
Now , environmentalists are becoming more hopeful that a project started in 1994 will pull the beady - eyed bird back from the brink .
Kiwi numbers have declined rapidly over the past century , as populations struggled with the twin threats of shrinking habitat and expanding legions of new predators .
Hispanics Go To ' War ' With PBS
The Congressional Hispanic Caucus has joined a campaign to include Hispanics in an upcoming PBS documentary on World War II , vowing to " put the squeeze " on top public television executives .
" We 're very much concerned about the lack of Hispanics in the documentary , " Chairman Joe Baca ( D - Calif . ) said .
" That 's appalling .
That 's a no - no to us . "

The Hispanic Caucus and other Latino interest groups have been troubled that the 14 - hour series -- " The War , " by renowned filmmaker Ken Burns and scheduled for broadcast in September -- features no Hispanics , even as it highlights African - Americans and Japanese - Americans .
They note that 500,000 Latinos served in World War II .
Rep. Ciro Rodriguez ( D - Tex . ) echoed Baca 's concerns .
" There is a lot of outrage and anger and disappointment , " he said .
" We 've come so far , and then we have n't .
It 's our responsibility to put the squeeze on people and educate them . "
Baca , Rodriguez and a half - dozen other caucus members met with PBS President Paula Kerger on Capitol Hill on Tuesday to discuss the issue .
They did not rule out trying to restrict federal funding of public television if PBS officials do not address some of their concerns .
" The bottom line is we also have the right to do what we can economically with PBS to show our displeasure , " Rodriguez said .
" I hope it wo n't come to that . "
The meeting was also attended by WETA Washington President Sharon Rockefeller and PBS board member Lionel Sosa .
Lobbyist Mickey Ibarra , who is representing PBS in the dispute , was also there , Rodriguez said .
" They definitely got the message we were extremely upset and a line had been crossed .
I think they realized they had made a mistake , " Rodriguez said .
But he noted that the PBS officials had not agreed to change the film , but rather to report back to the Hispanic Caucus in several weeks with a proposal .
Baca said he was searching for " some kind of remedy " that might involve delaying the documentary 's debut , redoing it , or adding material .
The Hispanic lawmakers are hoping to meet with Burns .
He finished the project last fall and has been touring the country giving previews to veterans groups .
It was after one screening that Latino groups sounded an alarm .
A PBS spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment , but in a written statement provided to the San Diego Union Tribune , Burns and co-producer Lynn Novick said they were " dismayed and saddened by any assumption that we intentionally excluded anyone from our series on the Second World War .
Nothing could be further from the truth . "
PBS has argued that the film focuses on individuals rather than groups and centers on four locales : Sacramento , Calif . ; Waterbury , Conn. ; Mobile , Ala. , and Luverne , Minn .
" For 30 years we have made films that have tried to tell many of the stories that have n't been told in American history , " Burns and Novick said .
" In this latest project , we have attempted to show the universal human experience of war by focusing on the testimonies of just a handful of people .
As a result , millions of stories are not explored in our film . "
Baca remained skeptical : " There were no Hispanics in Sacramento ? "

Response to this article
VADSTENA , a lakeside medieval town in central Sweden , has for centuries drawn pilgrims through the surrounding cornfields to the tomb of Saint Birgitta , a 14th - century noblewoman and mystic .
Five minutes ' walk from the abbey where her remains lie stands an imposing castle , surrounded by a moat , its tall Baroque tower looming through the mists that swirl off Lake Vättern .
In the cellars of this fortress are racks upon racks of cables , letters and documents , stored in plain cardboard boxes .
Two kilometres of them pertain loosely to one man , Ivar Kreuger , who in his heyday had a stature far more revered — at least in the world of finance and international diplomacy — than that of his devout countrywoman , Birgitta .
Occasionally his papers still lure curious visitors to Vadstena .
If Birgitta is the patron saint of Europe , Kreuger was the patron saint of sinners ; he was arguably the most brilliant and ambitious swindler who ever lived .
In the first three decades of the 20th century , he built up an industrial empire founded on the most humble of innovations , the Swedish - made safety match , that lit a fire of speculative excess around the world creating , then burning through , fortunes that would be measured now in the billions .
In the words of John Kenneth Galbraith , writing in 1961 , “ Boiler - room operators , peddlers of stocks in the imaginary Canadian mines , mutual - fund managers whose genius and imagination are unconstrained by integrity , as well as less exotic larcenists , should read about Kreuger .
He was the Leonardo of their craft . ”
This quiet man , who corresponded succinctly in many languages , could so nearly have become one of the 20th century 's great individuals .
When he shot a bullet , with steady - handed precision , through his heart in his Paris apartment on March 12th 1932 , it felt to many as if a light had gone out across a darkening inter-war Europe and Depression - era America .
His resounding optimism and his attempts to combat the era 's despair by channelling money from rich nations to impoverished ones had earned him admirers everywhere .
This newspaper , writing a week after his suicide , described the tragedy as one worthy of Aeschylus or Sophocles .
“ His death in Paris last Saturday by his own hand represents the veritably tragic wreck of a career which in its sphere was unsurpassed by that of any individual in living memory , ” it said .
Kreuger , it added grimly , in seeking to be a “ force for good ” , was crushed by the bleakness of his time .
So when The Economist , three weeks later , reported that chartered accountants had discovered “ deception and manipulation of accounts ” in his business empire , this paper was not alone in feeling bitterly humiliated .
The world threw up its hands in horror as details emerged of assets inflated by double counting and , worst of all , the forgery in Kreuger 's hand of $ 142 m of Italian bonds supposedly sold to him by Benito Mussolini 's government .
In Sweden , where Kreuger had been considered a national treasure for 25 years , the suicide rate rose and the prime minister fell .
It soon became clear that Kreuger 's businesses owed more than the country 's national debt .
In America shares of his international holding company collapsed , taking with them the life savings of thousands .
His reputable New York underwriters , Lee , Higginson , disbanded in shame .
After the “ Kreuger crash ” shook Wall Street , America 's Securities Act was passed in 1933 strengthening disclosure requirements for all companies selling stock .
It stemmed directly from the Kreuger experience .
It took five years for investigators to disentangle the accounts of his 400 companies .
The reckoning ?
In a 15 - year career he was estimated to have burned through about $ 400 m of his investors ' money .
His biographies sought to explain how a man of such genius and apparently noble aspirations destroyed so much .
One of the best , “ Kreuger , Genius and Swindler ” was written in 1961 by an American crime reporter , Robert Shaplen .
He traced the magnate 's life from bourgeois beginnings in Sweden , where he was a boy of prodigious intelligence and mischievous temperament ( “ a kind of Swedish Dennis the Menace ” ) , to greatness , and then calamity .
It ends unable to conceal the author 's awe at his bewitching subject , likening Kreuger to Dostoyevsky 's anti-hero in “ Crime and Punishment ” : “ Kreuger was a Raskolnikov of finance : he believed that superior men were not restricted by ordinary laws , and that the end justifies the means . ”
“ There is the dangerous cliché in the financial world [ that ] everything depends on confidence .
One could better argue the importance of unremitting suspicion . ”
Galbraith
Shaplen tries to draw a thick line under Kreuger 's legacy .
“ The things he was able to do in carrying out his swindle would never again be possible , and in that sense he may also be said to have been the last of a free - wheeling breed . ”
Yet that was written in strait - laced America when finance was still firmly under the knuckle of Depression - era regulation and money rarely travelled east of the Statue of Liberty .
Today 's financial world looks rather more like the era of rootless , trans - oceanic finance that Kreuger entered when he first arrived by ship in New York in 1900 , with $ 100 in his pocket .
Once again , credit has ballooned and capital flits around the world faster than any human being can travel ; those with the audacity to channel it where it is needed , as Kreuger did , can make unparalleled fortunes .
And once again , financial innovation is moving faster than rules can keep up with it , which can lead to disastrous speculative excesses .
Kreuger 's story is a lesson in the dangers of excessive confidence , and fickle liquidity , that may be as relevant today as they were in the Roaring Twenties .
As Galbraith , a scholar of speculative excess , pointed out when referring to Kreuger : “ There is the dangerous cliché in the financial world [ that ] everything depends on confidence .
One could better argue the importance of unremitting suspicion . ”
The movement of capital was already transforming Sweden when Kreuger was born in 1880 .
The country , long one of Europe 's industrial backwaters , sat on vast forestry and mineral assets .
International capital poured into Swedish factories , which were busy finessing new technologies .
One of the best - known , if more commonplace , inventions was the safety match , after a Swedish professor developed a non -toxic type of phosphorous , and stuck it on the side of match boxes .
Ivar 's father owned two match factories , but the young engineering graduate found little allure in the provincial family firm and at the age of 20 travelled to New York to seek his fortune .
Kreuger found a job as an engineer , helping build New York 's Plaza Hotel and other landmarks .
He resolved to apply what he had learned about new construction techniques back home in Sweden , and in 1908 , aged 28 , he set up a company in Stockholm with a friend .
The Kreuger & Toll partnership quickly gained a reputation as the best construction firm in Sweden , built the country 's first skyscraper and went public in 1914 .
But by then , Kreuger 's restless mind was absorbed with another venture , which , though so rudimentary compared with engineering , he intuitively sensed had grander scope .
Backed by a trio of Sweden 's top banks , he took over his father 's match business , and hoodwinked his uncle , who was drunk at the time , to let go of his British match interests .
When the outbreak of the first world war restricted the supply of aspen and chemicals used in Swedish matches , Kreuger found an opportunity to outflank Sweden 's biggest producer and force it into a reverse takeover .
By 1917 Kreuger was done with construction engineering ; he founded the Swedish Match Company and his reign as one of the world 's great monopolists — and financial engineers — began in earnest .
Just over a decade later in 1928 , The Economist , writing of Swedish Match , noted : “ It is curious that of the great international trusts in the industrial world there is none more firmly established than the colossus that has been built on matchsticks . ”
But the humble matchstick is not as puny as it sounds ; indeed , the ability to cup flame in the hand , rather than rubbing sticks together for hours , must count as one of the greatest innovations of all time .
After the war , its use spread around the world with gas ovens and cigarettes .
A letter written by Kreuger to a friend in 1931 reveals his profound faith in his product 's ability to hold its own in good times and bad .
Swedish Match , he confided , had “ not felt any effect of the present crisis ... Often great unemployment causes an increase in the consumption of matches because people seem to smoke more cigarettes when they are not working . ”
Striking a match
Matchmaking , however , is a fairly rudimentary business , and in post - war Europe , it took very little capital to run small , inefficient match factories that made just enough money to survive .
Kreuger 's vision was to consolidate them , and he did so in a way that brilliantly served a dual purpose : making him immensely rich and powerful on the one hand , and helping recapitalise Europe 's shattered post - war economies on the other .
Advertising Archives
After secretly acquiring factories around Europe during the years of post - war Depression in the early 1920s , from 1925 onwards Kreuger began offering a bargain to penniless governments that many found hard to refuse .
Kreuger would , he said ( usually with great secrecy ) , lend money to countries that provided him with a national monopoly on match production .
His monopoly and skilled marketing would increase sales ( Kreuger was a first - rate salesman , too : he is said to have propagated the myth that it is unlucky to light three cigarettes from the same match ) .
Governments taxed matches , so the higher sales would raise tax revenues used to repay the loans .
It was , boasted Kreuger , an almost foolproof business plan : the loans were secured against revenues that he controlled ; the monopolies , meanwhile , ensured generous returns .
According to a 1930 article in Foreign Affairs , Swedish Match struck such deals with nine European states and three South American countries in the 1920s .
The loans totalled $ 253 m , a fortune at the time .
Germany received $ 125 m ; France , which never granted a full monopoly , $ 75 m .
In 1930 Kreuger even sent an emissary from his New York broker , Lee , Higginson , to China to persuade the Chiang Kai - shek government to give it a monopoly .
The response was positive ; the finance minister , Kreuger 's envoy wrote , “ is one of the few Chinese with whom one can feel an accurate interchange of ideas is possible . ”
The country was at war over Manchuria , however , and Kreuger doubted the Nationalists ' ability to guarantee a monopoly .
He called the talks off .
From the outset , the monopoly - for - loans quid pro quo enabled Kreuger to portray himself less as a naked profiteer ( he was obsessed with maintaining “ stable ” ie , high , match prices ) and more as a statesman , with the interests of European political and economic stability at heart .
When much of Europe was starved of capital and balkanised after the Versailles peace treaty , he looked like a one - man Marshall Plan .
Many of his loans were put to good use ; he helped Germany , for example , to pay its war debts ; he then mediated at the 1930 reparations talks between France and Germany .
He could have accomplished none of it , however , without identifying another golden opportunity in that lop - sided era : the surplus capital in America and the greedy speculative spirit that accompanied it .
As Foreign Affairs put it in 1930 , “ the world war enriched America and impoverished Europe . ”
America 's government was loth to finance the reconstruction of the Old Continent , but on Wall Street , when Kreuger came knocking , the doors swung wide open .
In 1923 he set up the International Match Company ( IMCO ) in New York , and in less than ten years he raised an estimated $ 150 m from American investors .
All but $ 4.5 m of that was transferred abroad , to finance government loans and expansion of the match empire .
He hooked investors with an intoxicating cocktail of rising dividends and tax - exempt foreign earnings .
But despite the apparently flawless business model , match monopolies , it turned out , were not all that profitable .
In order to offer spectacular returns , Kreuger paid dividends out of capital , not earnings .
He was , in effect , operating a giant pyramid scheme , reliant on confidence to maintain a steady inflow of cash .
He rewarded their faith handsomely ; the stockmarket value of IMCO rose , according to Foreign Affairs , by 1,100 % between 1923 and 1930 .
Even during the stockmarket crash of 1929 , there was a mere hiccough before prices sailed higher .
In 1931 a New York Times advertisement stored in the castle at Vadstena summoned investors to take part in an IMCO issue of $ 50 m 5 % convertible gold debentures .
By then , it says , the company controlled 250 factories in 43 countries , many of which were operated under government - granted exclusivity .
The resources , it said , were to expand capacity in Poland , as well as buying German , Turkish and other government bonds .
The match business , it averred , by and large had “ not suffered from the general business depression ” .
The dazzling chutzpah with which Kreuger wheedled money out of American and other speculators was especially evident in the way he handled his companies ' finances .
It is here , perhaps , that Kreuger 's misdirected genius finds its most powerful resonance today .
A forthcoming book “ The Match King ” by Frank Partnoy , professor of law at the University of San Diego , will argue that the line of many of today 's most dazzling financial innovations can be traced directly back to Kreuger .
So can America 's landmark Depression - era securities and accounting laws , which still shape the world of finance .
So , too , can some of the most famous instances where those laws have been breached , such as the case of Enron , the collapsed American energy company .
Long before modern financiers created a market in asset - backed securities ( the source of this year 's turmoil ) Kreuger was a master of the art .
Effectively , the securities he sold to investors provided loans for governments secured against assets that he himself controlled .
The assets were held offshore , which today 's tax planners would welcome , and mostly off - balance sheet , the custom at Enron and many of the banks that have suffered this year .
He invented the activist investor 's dream of being able to control a company 's destiny without owning it , by separating A shares from B shares ( a practice until recently still common in Sweden ) .
That enabled him , in Shaplen 's estimation , to control a $ 600 m empire with ownership of just 1 % of the shares .
He wrote the book on mystifying Enron - style accounting practices : when Foreign Affairs took a bold stab at exploring his accounts in 1930 , it said the value of combined assets of all his companies was estimated at $ 630 m .
Of that , only $ 200 m were match - related ; another $ 400 m were simply lumped together as “ other investments ” ( it had $ 30 m in the bank ) .
Like other free - wheeling entrepreneurs , Kreuger did not disguise his contempt for accounting norms .
In a rare interview in 1929 , he told Isaac Marcosson of New York 's influential Saturday Evening
Post that the key to his success was “ silence , more silence , and even more silence ” .
( In a sycophantic letter to him found in Vadstena , Marcosson writes , “ I regard it as a great privilege to be your Boswell . ” )
Secrecy , and his extensive network of paid informers around Europe , served him well ; not only did it keep investors in the dark , but also enabled him to do deals with rival governments , such as republican France and fascist Italy , who loathed each other .
Yet amidst the telegrams and letters bundled in boxes in Vadstena , evidence of a growing concern about his affairs emerges after 1929 that suggests a cataclysm is in the making .
By late 1931 Kreuger is , for the first time , unable to provide a colleague with a definite assurance on IMCO 's dividend payments — the bedrock of the company 's allure .
A yellowing letter with frayed edges from one of his brokers at Lee , Higginson that year advises him , in unfailingly polite terms , that a couple of his bank creditors “ insist that they are not as completely informed about the company as they should be ” .
Apologising for the imposition , his correspondent relays their request for what is meant in his accounts by “ real - estate investments outside Sweden ” and “ other industrial shares ” .
In an eerie precursor of today 's concerns about American subprime mortgages , he is asked to explain , too , what he means by “ loans secured by real - estate mortgages ” .
Kreuger replies curtly that he is “ greatly disappointed ” by the attitude of the banks .
Corbis
An ignominious end
Kreuger 's luck was running out , and his unswerving confidence was beginning to look like a con-man 's desperate manoeuvring .
Short - sellers were targeting his companies .
Though he remained outwardly composed , a jotting on a cable reveals his private fears .
“ There is at present a bear attack going on and it is very important . ”
The end , when it came , was quick .
Desperate to keep his creditors at bay , he sought to arrange the merger of one of his companies , the Ericsson telecoms group , with America 's International Telephone & Telegraph .
With his back against the wall , he acceded to IT&T's request for an audit : they discovered a hole in his accounts .
In Sweden he was bailed out at the eleventh hour by a government which realised the economy was at risk from a Kreuger crash .
But by this stage , he was promising as collateral assets that he had already pledged to others .
A few creditors and colleagues believed there was one secret card remaining up his sleeve ; the Italian government bonds ( pictured above ) he had locked in his safe in Stockholm .
Only Kreuger knew that he had personally falsified the signatures on the bonds .
When it looked as though there was no alternative to owning up to the forgery , Kreuger walked to a gun-shop and bought a 9 mm automatic pistol .
That night , the man who had never married , who kissed women on the wrist rather than the hand for fear of germs , had a last tryst with a young Finnish girlfriend .
The next day , lying on his bed in a pin-stripe suit , he shot himself , blowing out the last flicker of illusion in a hopeless age .
A response from Sten Kreuger :
On December 19th 2007 you published an article about Ivar Kreuger headed " The match king " .
The article repeated a number of allegations previously made about Ivar Kreuger , including that he was guilty of financial impropriety and forgery .
The article also claimed that rather than owning up to the forgery , Ivar Kreuger committed suicide .
The article was mainly based on a book written by the journalist Robert Shaplen in 1960 .
There have been a number of publications about the life and business practices of Ivar Kreuger since his death in 1932 .
Already at the time of the publication of Robert Shaplen 's book there were a number of books that contradicted the theories put forward by Shaplen .
Also after 1960 several books were published that strongly question Shaplen 's theories .
At the end of 1990 previously classified material about Ivar Kreuger , contained in the Swedish National Archive in Riksarkivet , become available to the public for the first time .
The availability of new source material , together with recent research , has led to the publication of a number of books that support a different view of Ivar Kreuger .
The work of Mr Lars - Jonas Ångström has revealed new information about the circumstances of Ivar Kreuger 's death that casts doubt over the alleged suicide .
Mr Ångström 's work also challenges allegations of financial impropriety made against Ivar Kreuger , in particular that he was responsible for the forgery of Italian bonds supposedly sold to him by Benito Mussolini 's government .
It is very disappointing that you choose not to report any of these new findings in your article , which merely repeats outdated views of Kreuger the swindler and that you have refrained from mentioning the other views and theories that have been put forward by renowned journalists and writers .
I am of the opinion that it is remarkable that one of the world 's leading economic publications can choose to base an article mainly on outdated material and without taking into consideration the research and theories that has been put forward both before 1960 and thereafter .

Hilarious ignorance from a country where major telcos , ISPs , and web sites almost routinely hand over information to your government to " fight terrorist " !
While many Hong Kong people are probably also accessing English content , the writer has clearly not seen the blogging activity in a typical internet cafe in China lately .
Unfortunately , many Hong Kong Chinese cannot read simplified Chinese and anyway prefer more serious news and information sources from Hong Kong , Singapore , UK , and the US anyways .

hah in toledo you get 7 mbit for 50ish + via buckeye and 1.5 mbit for 20ish + from at&t because buckeyes 1.5 mbit line is a joke
if it comes to toledo it would be 150 + per / month the way buckeye charges for stuff and they would severely cap the upload like cable is now

I 'd murder my best friend to get 100 M bps symmetrical , that 's if he does n't get me first for it .
We 're lucky if 10 M bps is even in the area , and often it much more than $ 48.50 / mo ( 6 M bps in my area is $ 49 / mo ) .
Plus it 's pretty much impossible to get an upstream higher than 786 Kbps in North America .

100 mps symettrical to what ?
The ISP ?
Talking about speeds like this are stupid , because no one on this has 100 mbps to the Internet .
So it goes 100 mbps up to the ISP , who then squeaks out maybe 30 Mbps to the Internet .
Big whoopie .

We do n't have fiber strung literally between every block as they do .
Our population density and civil design is vastly different .
That 's why it costs more here .
Go one and buy a couple Cisco routers and set up your ISP .
You 'll find out exactly how much it costs and the idea that it's a conspiracy to keep people off the net is as absurd as it sounds .

Bottom line is , we 're not offered 100 Mbps because providers know " they do n't have to " .
We kick and scream about speeds , point our fingers at how the rest of the world is eating our broadband shorts , then we shut up and pay the $ 49 for sub - 10 M service each month .
If there was a large - scale movement in America where internet users went " on strike " , cancelling their DSL and cable - internet services by the millions and going back to dialup until we were offered 50 Mbps symmetrical for $ 49 / mo. , I would absolutely participate .
But I know that will never happen .
We 've become a society that will bitterly complain about being fed sewage , yet happily swallow it rather than fighting it .
And anyone who knows anything about maintaining large networks knows the cost of acquisition is trivial compared to the TCO over time .

If that was true , then MDU here and the dense urban areas would have 100 mbs symmetrical service , but most areas would n't .
Too bad it 's not true .
The reason this has n't appeared here yet is simple : Greed .
It 's far more profitable to charge the max possible and deliver the lowest level of service .

The only reason that Hong Kong has these speeds is because of that " evil " greed .
People in search of a profit have to compete .
In the USA a lot of government sanctioned monopolies exist which limit competition ( competition of a race for money IE GREED ) .
Hong Kong is one of the most economically free places in the world .
Its not American companies greed that keeps our speed low , its government protectionism .

No surprise here .
Broadband is ridiculously cheap in HK ( ca n't remember the rate our friends told us they paid per month , but it was a fraction of the cost of what I pay in the US ) .
I remember also walking into internet cafes where the going rate was HKD $ 10 per hour , which is less than USD $ 1.50 per hour - by far the cheapest I 've seen anywhere I 've traveled .

Also as its already been stated .
They are able to deploy this mainly because of their living arrangements .
I 'd rather live in my house with my 12 Mb/ 1Mb connection then live in an apartment complex with 1000 + tenants and a quarter of the space .
Actually , if you browse the IRC channels these days , most of the illegal content is handled via these 100 M bit oversea 's connections and believe me , they have stats that show they 're in the terabyte range for bandwidth used .

Fort Worth , TX Ben Premium Member Hmm ... 100 Mbps symmetrical for $ 50 / mo .?
What I , indeed , have to wonder are a few things :
- Artificial Caps .
What are the numbers , if any ?
This is n't to be confused with technical limits , like a T1 really can only transfer 487GB in a month ( full saturation 24/7 ) .
- Reliability .
How reliable is such a connection ?
If it 's down half the time then I do n't care how fast it is .
- Contracts .
What it says .
Annual contracts , or month - to - month ?
- Equipment .
Can you get the equipment when you sign up , or do you have to buy your own ?
If the latter , what does the equipment cost ?
- Availability .
Can anyone with the money get this ?
Or are there geographical limits ?
For example , FIOS sounds cool , and the rates would even be affordable for me .
But I do n't care , because I can't get it .
The only alternative for similar speed service would be a T3 line , although at least I 'd get an awesome SLA .
NOTE : I did read the article .
It talks about Hong Kong .
What I mean is , can anyone there get the service ?
- Restrictions .
Are there limits to what you can do ?
Can I attach a Linux box , make it into an FTP server , and start sharing files ?
Can I run a website from said box ?
- Government Intervention .
What did the government do , if anything ?
I do n't buy the argument " But it 's a smaller foot - print . "
The reason I do n't is because then all the major metro areas in this country would have such services available .
It 's why rural areas were the last to get phone service back in the day , and why people even as late as the 1940s used outhouses , again in rural areas .
There 's a lot more to an Internet connection than simply speed and the monthly spend .
As far as rural areas , sometimes I wonder if there 's any hope .
I 'm hoping fiber will be the answer , because I remember from a class I took once that the fiber itself is a cheap medium , although the connectors and equipment are n't so cheap .
And that fiber can also cover longer distances .
It 's not like plumbing , where even to this day houses in the middle of nowhere are n't attached to city - wide plumbing .
At least alternatives such as water - pumps / wells and septic tanks exist .
With Internet access , there 's no way around the " line , " and the fact it needs to be built out there .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Hackers compromised dozens of Department of Homeland Security computers , moving sensitive information to Chinese - language Web sites , congressional investigators said Monday .
Investigators pointed a finger at a government contractor , saying the firm hired to protect DHS computers tried to hide the incidents from the department .
The FBI is investigating the incidents , a congressional staffer said , and two members of Congress have asked the department 's inspector general to also launch an investigation .
" The results of our [ committee ] investigation suggest that the department is the victim not only of cyber attacks initiated by foreign entities , but of incompetent and possibly illegal activity by the contractor charged with maintaining security on its networks , " Democratic Reps.
Bennie Thompson of Mississippi and James Langevin of Rhode Island said in a written statement .
The lawmakers said committee investigators found dozens of DHS computers were compromised and the incidents " were not noticed until months after the initial attacks . "
The extent of the damage is unclear , but a House Homeland Security Committee staff member said the hackers " took significant amounts of information . "
" We know where it [ the information ] was taken from , but we do n't know what was taken .
We only know how many megabytes was taken , " the staff member said .
" Everything was on the LAN A , which was an unclassified network .
To the best of our knowledge there was no classified information [ taken ] . "
The Web site where the information was moved was described only as a " Web hosting service that connects to Chinese Web sites . "
The committee declined to say whether they were Chinese government sites .
In their letter requesting an investigation , Thompson and Langevin said that " contractors provided inaccurate and misleading information to Department of Homeland Security officials about the source of these attacks and attempted to hide security gaps in their capabilities . "
The letter does not name the contractor , but a committee staffer identified it as Unisys Corp. , which has a $ 1 billion contract to safeguard DHS computers .
In a written statement , Unisys disputed the allegations , which were made public Monday in a Washington Post article .
According to the House Homeland Security Committee , Unisys was charged with installing intrusion detection systems , but the systems were not fully deployed at the time of the initial incidents .
If they had been , " the initial intrusions may have been detected and prevented , " Thompson and Langevin said .
" Unisys vigorously disputes the allegations made in today 's article , " the company said in a statement issued Monday , referring to the Washington Post story .
" Facts and documentation contradict the claims described in the article , but federal security regulations preclude public comment on specific incidents . "
" We can state generally that the allegation that Unisys did not properly install essential security systems is incorrect .
In addition , we routinely follow prescribed security protocols and have properly reported incidents to the customer in accordance with those protocols . "
Department of Homeland Security spokesman Russ Knocke declined to comment on allegations Unisys covered up evidence of hacking .
" We take cyber security very seriously and there have been major improvements since the administration 's cyber security strategy announced in 2003 , " he said .
Knocke said DHS has responded to " malicious cyber activity directed at the U.S. government over the past few years , " and such activity is " growing more sophisticated and frequent . "
The government is " re-competing " the Unisys contract and other contracts " to integrate it into a single contract that maximizes the tax payer 's dollar . "
And although Unisys can still compete for the contract , previous performance will be weighed , said Knocke .

An Iraqi couple were beheaded in front of their children by their cousins because the man wore Western - style trousers .
Three suspected al Qaeda militants , including two sisters , beheaded their uncle and his wife , forcing the couple 's children to watch , according to Iraqi police .
The killing came because the school guard Youssef al - Hayali was considered an infidel because he did not pray and wore western - style trousers .
Scroll down for more ...
The militants , later arrested in Diyala province northwest of Baghdad , killed Hayali and his wife Zeinab Kamel at the all - boys school in Jalawlah .
Sunni Arab communities across Iraq have been turning against al Qaeda because of its indiscriminate killings and strict interpretation of Islam , which includes a ban on smoking in public and forcing schoolgirls to wear veils .
Sunni Arab tribal sheikhs have been organising their young men into neighbourhood police units to drive out al Qaeda , a practice which U.S. and Iraqi officials say has helped bring down violence levels across Iraq .
The U.S. military said earlier in November that it was sending 3,000 soldiers home from the province but added that the overall number of forces in the province would not decrease .

The United States poured an extra 30,000 troops into Iraq from mid-February in a bid to stop the country from sliding into civil war .
U.S. and Iraqi officials say the troop " surge " and more efficient Iraqi security forces have also helped bring about sharp falls in U.S. military and Iraqi civilian casualties in the past two months .
U.S. Senators Announce Opposition to “ Enhanced Interrogation ” and “ Unitary Executive ”
WASHINGTON , D.C. –
One month after < a href = ” http://lieberman.senate.gov/newsroom/release.cfm?id=287809″>calling for a review of the video game ratings process < / a > in the wake of “ Manhunt 2 ″ receiving a “ Mature ” rating , Senators Joe Lieberman ( ID - CT ) , Sam Brownback ( R- KS ) , Evan Bayh ( D - IN ) , and Hillary Rodham Clinton ( D - NY ) called for a thorough review of the video game “ Enhanced Interrogation 2 . ”
In a letter to the Entertainment Software Ratings Board ( ESRB ) , the Senators explained that the recent change in the game ’s rating in the U.S. opened the door to widespread release of the game , which depicts acts of prolonged torture .
In their letter to ESRB president Patricia Vance , the Senators wrote :
“ In October 2007 the British Board of Film Classification ( BBFC ) again refused to rate a revised ‘ Enhanced Interrogation 2 ’ stating that ‘ the impact of the revisions on the bleakness and callousness of tone , or the essential nature of the gameplay , is clearly insufficient .
There has been a reduction in the visual detail in some of the “ interrogations , ” but in others they retain their original visceral and casually sadistic nature . ’
Other countries agreed and have also banned the game .
“ As Americans , we cannot countenance the digital representation of inhumane interrogation techniques like waterboarding and long - term sleep deprivation .
This is not simply a matter of our children ’s entertainment ; it speaks profoundly to our character as a nation , albeit only in a virtual sense . ”
Senators Lieberman and Clinton added , in a separate statement , that they were also concerned about the video game “ Unitary Executive , ” which apparently encourages children to read Article II of the United States Constitution so as to override the separation of powers and set the President above the law .
“ The Presidency as envisioned in this video game is an utterly autocratic institution , ” wrote Senator Lieberman .
“ In fact , the game teaches children to have nothing but contempt for Congress and the judiciary .
‘ Unitary Executive ’ is a dangerous , deeply corrosive video game that effectively allows players to establish a virtual dictatorship in America , and we must oppose its sale and distribution with all the power of the United States Senate .
Our very integrity as an institution is at stake . ”
Senator Clinton did not comment specifically on “ Unitary Executive , ” but did say , through an aide , that if she were to become President , virtual opposition to virtual torture would be among her top priorities .

BEIJING ( Reuters ) -
The world is eating more than it produces and food prices may climb for years because of expansion of farming for fuel and climate change , risking social unrest , an expert and a new report said on Tuesday .

Biofuel expansions alone could push maize prices up over two - thirds by 2020 and increase oilseed costs by nearly half , with subsidies for the industry effectively constituting a tax on the poor , the International Food Policy Research Institute said .
Global cereal stocks , a key buffer used to fight famines around the world , have sunk to their lowest level since the 1980s due to reduced plantings and poor weather , said the institute ’s director general , Joachim von Braun .
“ The world eats more than it produces currently , and over the last five or six years that is reflected in the decline in stocks and storage levels .
That can not go on , and exhaustion of stocks will be reached soon , ” he told a conference in Beijing .
Countries such as Mexico have already experienced food riots over soaring prices , von Braun added in a report released at the same meeting , held by the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research .
“ The days of falling food prices may be over , ” said von Braun , lead author of the “ World Food Situation ” report .
“ Surging demand for food , feed and fuel have recently led to drastic price increases ... climate change will also have a negative impact on food production , ” he added .
Growing financial investor interest in commodity markets as prices climb is fueling price volatility , and world cereal and energy prices are increasingly closely linked .
With oil prices hovering around $ 90 a barrel , this is bad news for the poor , who have already suffered “ quite dramatic ” impacts from a tripling in wheat prices and near - doubling in rice prices since 2000 , the report said .
More investment in agricultural technology , a stronger social welfare net with particular support for children , an end to trade barriers and improved infrastructure and finance opportunities in less - developed countries , could all help improve food security .
Although increased trade , a key demand of many developing world nations in global talks , would bring economic gains , in many cases it would not significantly reduce poverty , the report added .
WARMING , BIOFUELS LOOM
Global warming could cut worldwide income from agriculture 16 percent by 2020 , despite the potential for increased yields in some colder areas and the fertilizing impact on plants of having higher carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere .
“ With the increased risk of droughts and floods due to rising temperatures , crop -yield losses are imminent , ” the report said .
It warned that Africa would be hit particularly hard by changes in weather patterns , in which scientist say man-made gases pumped into the atmosphere are an important factor .
“ When taking into account the effects of climate change , the number of undernourished people in Sub-Saharan Africa may triple between 1990 and 2080 , ” the report said .
Biofuels also threaten nutrition for the poor .
Under current investment plans , and assuming expansion in nations with high - potential but without detailed plans , maize prices would rise a quarter by the end of the next decade .
Under a more dramatic expansion , prices could climb up to 72 percent for maize and 44 percent for oilseeds , the report said .
Even when next - generation biofuels that use feedstocks such as wood and straw become commercially viable , competition for resources from water to investment capital may continue .
Global food demand is shifting towards higher - value vegetables , diary , fruits and meat as a result of rapid economic growth in developing countries including China and India .
But it can be difficult for smaller farmers to take advantage of the trend because of large retailers ’ growing grip on the market and their high safety , quality and other requirements .
Suddenly you have a vehicle that 's pretty frugal in the use of resources required to manufacture it , does n't require any particular level of fitness and is ready to plug into the electricity grid .
I can also imagine manufacturer 's addding little ' bubble ' cages around them soon , to provide weather protection so that the list of reasons not to ' cycle to work ' reduces even further .
Take a typical push - bike and modify it with an electric motor and a small battery pack and you have a vehicle which could get millions of people through their daily commute for an order of magnitude ( or two ) less than they currently need .
However , thinking about this future raises some other concerns .
While total freight traffic must decline , it 's likely that big trucks will still be common because of their efficiency per unit transported .
Buses are also going to be a big part of our public transport future .
But these trucks and buses will be sharing the roadspace with an increasing number of small and ultra -small vehicles .
We could see a bi-modal size distribution of vehicles develop on our roads , which has hefty implications for road safety and infrastructure planning .
Another result of this is that line between ' cars ' and ' bikes ' will become increasingly fuzzy .
Consider the ' vehicles ' in the picture below , all of which are powered by human muscle ( calories ) or batteries , except the Harley Davidson motorbike and the Smart Car ( which could easily be converted ) .
Now try to answer the following questions :
Which of these vehicle types do you think we should have more of ?
Which ones should be allowed on main roads ?
Which ones could use an on - road bicycle lane amongst traffic ?
Which ones could use an off - road bicycle path in your local park ?
Which ones should get free entry into congestion charging zones ?
Which ones require dedicated parking spaces ?
Which ones would you feel safe in ?
Which ones should you be able to carry on a train ?
Which ones should be taxed , and which ones subsidised ?
Which ones should ' bicycle ' advocacy groups support ?
Can you agree on the answers to those questions ?
What would your local transport planner say ?
The world 's largest BitTorrent tracker is no longer running on Hypercube , the tracker originally developed by Anakata , one of the Pirate Bay founders .
The Pirate Bay switched to Opentracker which uses less resources and supports UDP tracking .
The Pirate Bay had been testing Opentracker for a few weeks before they completely abandoned Hypercube .
They have now switched to the new software on all their trackers , 16 in total .
We asked TiAMO from The Pirate Bay why they decided to switch to Opentracker , he told us : “ Well it ’s faster than hypercube and uses less resources .
Also it supports UDP tracking which hypercube did not . ”
Opentracker is a lightweight BitTorrent tracker which uses minimal resources ( it runs fine on your WLAN router ) .
The software does not store any data or log any IP - addresses and is more stable and efficient than most other tracker software .
The guys from Opentracker , once falsely accused of conspiring with the MPAA and MediaDefender , are the same guys who run denis.stalker.h3q.com .
Their tracker was placed third on our list of 5 most popular BitTorrent trackers , but after Demonoid went down they moved up a spot .
It is now the most frequently used BitTorrent tracker after The Pirate Bay .
At the moment , the Pirate Bay and denis.stalker.h3 q together track more than 9.000.000 peers and 1.000.000 torrents .
In fact , the majority of all the BitTorrent transfers are handled by Opentracker .

" Does he like me ? "
Are you wondering if a certain guy likes you ?
Here , I will help you answer it once and for all .
First , it 's important for you to know that men , even with our best intentions , are not good at expressing how we feel .
Leaving you hanging is not always part of the plan ... sometimes guys just do n't know how to tell you they like you .
Perhaps it 's because our parents do n't teach us how ( obviously our fathers do n't know because they are men and our mothers do n't know what 's really going on in our head because they are n't men ) , or maybe because everything we see in society says guys should n't express emotions and feelings and we buy into it .
It might even be hardwired into our genetics since long ago when we saw something we wanted , we hit it with a club and took it home with us ( speaking of which , please do n't try this , I wont get into details , but trust me ) .
Society says guys should n't express emotions and feelings and we buy into it .
Whatever the reason is , it comes as no surprise that women are typically clueless about how we feel about them .
So I am acting as an ambassador to help decode the signals men send and try to explain how a guy will act if he likes you .
I have talked to a lot of women that have questions about whether or not the guy that they are interested in is interested in them .
If this guy looks at me every time I pass him , or " What does it mean when a guy .
. . " , or perhaps " This guy asked me for my number , but he has n't called " .
Honestly , I could go on for hours about thousands of particular does this guy like me situations .
I believe , however , that whether a guy likes you or whether he does n't can be summed up into just one sign ( that has thousands of variations ) :
It does n't matter what he is , or is not doing , the important thing is that he is ( or is n't ) doing it around you .
He is either around you or he is n't .
More than 98 % of the time , if a guy likes you , then he is going to be around you .
It does n't matter if he is not talking directly to you or even blatantly ignoring you .
Even if he is making fun of you , picking fights or punching you in the arm and then running away .
One way or another , no matter what he is doing , he is doing it around you , and I guarantee you , this is true for men of all ages .
This does n't mean that your interested man is going to be right next to you , or even within a few feet of you .
But typically , if he is interested in you , he will find reasons to be close to you , even if that closeness means that he is only able to look at you from across the room .
If you really think about it , you will see exactly what I mean .
What does it mean that every day when I see him in the hall , he looks right at me ?
That does n't matter , what matters is that every day he has found a way to pass you in the hall so that he CAN look at you .
Why does this guy always make fun of me ?
Because if he grunted , you would think that he was weird , and he has no other way to tell you that he likes you .
But he never says anything to me !
I 'll bet why that is so frustrating to you is because he is always close enough to say something , but he never does .
See what I am talking about ?
It does n't matter what he is , or is not doing , the important thing is that he is ( or is n't ) doing it around you .
Ladies , I also think that it 's important that you understand that most men , no matter how old we get , never grow out of this .
On the flipside of this coin , no matter what a guy is doing , if he is not doing it around you , typically he has no interest in you .
Even if what he is doing are exactly like the examples above , if he is not around you more times than not , he probably does n't have any feelings for you .
Every time I start to get close , he goes somewhere else , or My class is next to his , but I never see him in the hallway , or perhaps a little more extreme I went back to his apartment the next day , and someone else was living there .
Just as we have trouble telling someone we do like them , we have the same trouble telling someone we do n't .
So , instead , we avoid you .
Some might say that we as men are just scared of rejection , and I believe that is true to some degree .
But more so , I think that we just have trouble saying what we truly feel , or that we are hoping that if we are around you long enough you will start to understand our language , tell us you like us , and then invite us out to dinner ( and if you paid too that would be absolutely super ) .
Whatever the case may be , the best sign to look for to see if he is interested in you , is if , no matter what foolishness he is doing , he is doing it around you .

BAGHDAD ( Reuters ) - A group of gunmen killed in U.S. airstrikes in Iraq last week were pro-U.S. fighters , an American military officer said on Sunday , despite the military ’s public statements that they were insurgents .
The officer , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said U.S. military officials had talked to Sunni Arab tribal sheikhs in Taji , just north of Baghdad , to express their regret for the loss of life in the attack , which took place last Tuesday .
“ There was some confusion and we were not able to turn off the attack quickly enough , ” he said of the airstrikes that continued for several hours despite frantic phone calls from local tribal leaders to the U.S. base in Taji .
“ We have talked to them and explained our sorrow over the incident and the loss of lives of volunteers trying to bring order to their neighbourhoods , ” the officer said .
The incident threatens to derail a carefully constructed relationship between U.S. forces and anti-al Qaeda Sunni tribes in Taji and has put the spotlight on operating procedures for tribal police units the U.S. military is forming around Iraq .
“ If they ( the U.S. military ) do not give us a proper reason for what happened , we will withdraw from the Awakening Council and let al Qaeda return , ” said Sheikh Shathir Abid Salim , leader of the anti-al Qaeda group .
His brother was among those killed .
The military said in a statement last week that it killed 25 suspected insurgents in operations targeting al Qaeda militants near the capital .
Tribal leaders told Reuters U.S. warplanes had mistakenly bombed their men , killing 45 .
The U.S. military officer told Reuters the men targeted in the airstrikes were a mixture of volunteers from the Taji Awakening Council and tribesmen loyal to Sheikh Shathir .
TRIBESMEN
He said U.S. forces in Taji , elements of the 1st Brigade , 1st Cavalry Division had signed a contract with the Awakening Council for tribesmen to man checkpoints in their battlespace .
Sheikh Shathir had carried out “ a personal mission outside the scope of the contract ” , sending his tribesmen outside the 1st Brigade ’s battlespace to set up roadblocks in an area controlled by another U.S. military unit , he said .
“ They were well - intentioned , trying to do what was best , ” the officer said .
What happened next is still unclear but it appears that the neighbouring U.S. military unit , unaware they were members of the Taji Awakening Council , then identified the tribesmen as enemy fighters and called in airstrikes to kill them .
U.S. military spokesman Rear Admiral Greg Smith told reporters in Baghdad on Sunday , however , that what happened was “ no accidental attack against what we identified as terrorists ” .
“ Our understanding to date is that the individuals that were killed and those that were captured were all participating in an activity that we deemed to be not in the best interest of Iraq , ” Smith said .
The spokesman for the 1st Brigade , 1st Cavalry Division , the U.S. military unit in the Taji area , had said earlier on Sunday that the incident was still under investigation .
“ The sheikhs told us that it was members of their tribe .
We are investigating to find out exactly what occurred , ” Major Randall Baucomb said .
The Taji Awakening Council is modelled on a similar council formed by Sunni Arab tribes in Iraq ’s western Anbar province last year to fight Sunni Islamist al Qaeda .
Since then , many similar councils have been set up in other areas of Iraq .
In partnership with the U.S. military , the councils have formed 186 “ concerned local citizens ” groups ( CLCs ) , recruiting more than 70,000 men who play a key role in the new U.S. counter - insurgency strategy to combat al Qaeda .
“ If there are CLCs who were caught up in that particular incident on that particular day , that ’s unfortunate , ” Smith said on Sunday .
“ It remains to be seen exactly what role the Taji CLC group was playing on that day . ”

I ’ve been seeing a lot of media coverage on the increase in foreclosures recently .
It ’s clear that there have been examples of predatory and misleading lending practices , as well as examples of people showing poor financial judgment , although most articles seem to focus on the former .
But I could n’t help finding this Wall Street Journal article ‘ Subprime ’ Aftermath : Losing the Family Home to be almost amusing .
If it was trying to illustrate how sub - prime lenders were evil , it did a really bad job .
Take Ms. April Williams , who is the main character interviewed for this story and also featured in the box to the right .
“ This has stripped us of our whole pride , ” says April Williams , 47 years old , who has until August to pay off her mortgage or vacate the two - story Colonial at 5170 , where she and her husband have lived for 11 years .
“ There ’s going to be no people left in Detroit if they keep doing this to them . ”
They did this to them ?
Let ’s see here – they have an unstable job , but still decide to purchase stainless - steel appliances , custom tile , a new bay window , central air - conditioning , a backyard koi pond … and is that a $ 50,000 Lincoln Navigator luxury SUV parked in her driveway ??
For this specific situation , I feel like both sides are in many ways getting their just desserts .
Borrowers like Ms. Williams were greedy , bought more toys than they could afford , and now have to deal with the penalties .
Their lenders were also greedy in extending them so much undeserved credit , and I ’m sure will be losing money in the event of a foreclosure .
As for the big picture , I have mixed feelings .
The capitalistic pro-free markets side of me thinks the system will fix itself .
Lenders who got hit with all these defaults will tighten borrowing standards accordingly to maintain profits , while continuing competition will keep them honest .
A bail - out would just create a bigger mess of things .
At the same time , I do think there should be regulations that require more simplicity and transparency in mortgage lending and real estate transactions .
Everyone I talk to says that they are faced with 6 inches of paperwork when closing on a new home , and none of them fully understands it all .
Everybody says “ just sign ” .
There could be a clause that gives up your first - born child for $ 19.95 and you would n’t know it in all that legalese .
Douglas Adams : The First and Last Tapes .
Part 4 of 3 . ( Yes , it 's the fourth part of the trilogy . . . )
By Ian Shircore
Read Part 1 | Read Part 2 | Read Part 3
In keeping with the best traditions of The Hitchhiker 's Guide to the Galaxy , Darker Matter is proud to present , this month , the fourth part of our three - part interview with the great Douglas Adams , based on long - lost cassette tapes recorded on a summer 's day in 1979 .
The story so far is that Douglas has written the first radio series of Hitchhiker 's and seen it broadcast twice without making the impact that might have been expected .
Pan Books are keen to get the paperback version into the shops and there is a definite groundswell of excitement beginning to build up around the show and its author .
Yet the man at the centre of all this is still having to hold down a day job as a temporary script editor for Dr Who , just to keep body and soul together .
He 's working at the BBC all day and sweating over the first Hitchhiker 's book and the second radio series far into the night .
And when freelance journalist Ian Shircore mentions his conviction that Adams is on his way to being a household name , the interview wobbles and nearly skids to a halt .
With hindsight , it 's hard to see what Douglas was worrying about .
Within months he was a best - selling author and trendy vicars everywhere were misquoting his jokes to spice up their sermons .
Within a few more years , he had achieved worldwide fame , become known as a passionate advocate of atheism and Apple computers and assembled what he claimed was the world 's biggest collection of lefthanded guitars .
He never found writing easy , but he never again got himself into the situation he was in in 1979 , where the almost unbearable pressure he was under resulted , paradoxically , in the production of some of his finest work .
From an early age , Douglas Adams had a fine ear for humorous dialogue – and a genuinely comic ability to grasp the wrong end of the stick .
Curled up under the bedclothes , he listened with glee to the punning , surreal , outrageous lunacy of Kenneth Horne , Kenneth Williams , Hugh Paddick and Bill Pertwee in the BBC Light Programme series Beyond Our Ken .
He was distraught when the show ended in 1965 , and totally failed to understand when it was brought back just two months later in a similar format and with much the same line - up , under a slightly different title .
' I used to love Beyond Our Ken , ' he confided .
' Then it came back as Round the Horne and , for some reason , I thought " The title 's different , so it 's not the same show . "
So I did n't listen to it . '
It was n't the only time Douglas jumped to a wrong conclusion or saw things in himself that would eventually inspire his comic muse .
As he grew up , he learned to live with the fact that he could be spectacularly clumsy , impossibly unworldly and , at times , irredeemably gloomy .
But it 's part of the skill of a comic genius to fashion this kind of raw material into the stuff of great art .
Douglas Adams frequently told the world about the source of one of his best - loved creations , Marvin , the hyper - intelligent , hyper - miseryguts robot ( ' What are you supposed to do with a manically depressed robot ? '
' You think you 've got problems ?
What are you supposed to do if you are a manically depressed robot ?
Gives me a headache just trying to think down to your level ' ) .
Marvin was supposedly based on a former scriptwriting colleague of his called Andrew Marshall , who later won fame and fortune with his 1990s TV series 2 Point 4 Children .
Having blighted Marshall 's early career with this unfortunate slur , Adams admitted that another strand in Marvin 's saturnine persona had its origins rather closer to home .
' I get into terribly depressed states , and a lot of Marvin 's actual lines come from occasions like that , ' Adams revealed .
' There 's a certain amount of me in there . '
In fact , according to Douglas , he had been ' fairly neurotic ' as a child and was still ' incredibly shy and self - conscious ' as an adult .
But this was one of the many aspects of his life that was beginning to change as people became aware of The Hitchhiker 's Guide and the talent that created it .
' I 've suddenly realised , very recently , that it 's actually comfortable to go to something public , like a party , and know that some part of you has gone on ahead , so that people know something about you .
' It is difficult to come to terms with seeing yourself in a different and more public light .
I felt very lost for a time , and it took a while to settle down and get my bearings again .
I 'm not even sure I can say that I 've found them yet .
But at least I 've now got used to the process that 's going on . '
The progress from this self - effacing introspection to the confident , witty and relaxed star of a host of later TV interviews and conference appearances obviously had a lot to do with Douglas 's dawning realisation that people were genuinely grateful to him for the laughter and ideas he gave them .
Any majority is made up of smaller minorities , and Douglas was inevitably pigeonholed , at first , with the science fiction writers of his generation , on the one hand , and the post - Python school of British humorists on the other .
But once the Hitchhiker 's snowball started rolling , it was quickly clear that he was appealing to more than just the SF community or the committed Monty Python fans .
His delight at seeing his work transcend all categories until it existed as a unique phenomenon in its own right , with huge international audiences of every age and background , must have gone a long way towards eliminating any niggling self - doubt .
Not having to fret about where the next chunk of income was coming from will have helped , too , especially after the ups and downs of his early career .
By the time of this interview , he had already tasted enough modest financial success to know that he would need a lot more .
' I find the difference , for me , between having no money and having quite a bit is that the bills get bigger .
And that 's it .
The lifestyle does n't change .
' The reason I hope I 'll make a lot of money is that I 'm actually so hopeless about it .
I just do n't understand the nature of the beast , so I 'm very bad at holding on to it . '
Douglas had managed to spend almost six months writing the six episodes of the first Hitchhiker 's radio series ' for an initial fee of about £ 1,000 ' .
Even though he 'd squeezed in four Dr Who scripts as well , he 'd still been left working in an office for the BBC and hiding from his bank manager .
Now the numbers were starting to get bigger , with a much better fee for the second radio series and the prospect of ' about 9 or 10 grand ' for the six - part TV show , and Douglas was starting to think about the real business prospects for his creation .
The TV series , he explained , should trigger much better sales of the book and the LP record .
And then , he added , ' It 's all a question of sales abroad . '
Douglas Adams may not have been good at keeping hold of money , but he was quite well aware of how it was made .
He had , for example , already calculated that the big bucks from US television would not come from the BBC selling its programmes to the American public broadcasting network .
They could , however , arrive in the form of a format sale , in which a US company would buy the rights to remake the series with a transatlantic flavour .
The inspiration for this line of thinking was the fortune made by the writers of the limp Seventies sitcom Man About the House , which became Three 's Company in the US and ran for several years , making a lot of people very rich .
Douglas was not squeamish about the moral dangers of sudden wealth , and he was certainly prepared to explore this kind of future for The Hitchhiker 's Guide .
' There 's a bloke who 's interested in buying the rights to make the show in America .
I 've been told the guys who wrote Man About the House sold the format rights to American TV and made $ 700,000 each , over a period of two years .
But it 's all pie in the sky .
Let 's see what actually comes in .'
Though he obviously chafed at the need to stay a little longer on the Dr Who staff , Douglas used the experience to sharpen his awareness of the vital differences between radio and television .
He had already seen his own Dr Who scripts go through the mill of the TV production process , and had not much liked some of the final output .
' When you 're writing something , you have to believe this is the way it should be .
' But you know it 's going to go through hundreds of people before it gets to the screen and it'll end up looking totally unlike anything you envisaged .
So you also have to learn to divorce yourself from everything you put into it and judge the final product not according to your original intentions but according to whether the thing you see is good .
And that 's hard to do .
' When you 've seen something that 's not at all what you envisaged , it 's more difficult to go back next time and put yourself in the frame of mind of a writer .
So you have to learn to take what satisfaction you can from getting it right the first time . '
This big team , almost corporate , approach contrasted vividly with the ' rock sessions ' ethos in which the original radio series had been created .
Though he was ready to take on the challenges of putting Hitchhiker 's on television , there was no doubt which way of working suited Douglas 's soul .
Though recording necessarily involves actors ' interpretations and technical processes , the radio shows had still ended up ' fairly close ' to the author 's original vision .
' I was there the whole time , which is fairly unusual .
There were very few things I would have objected to – just the odd turn of phrase or the odd sound - effect .
' We 'd be down in that dark underground studio for hours and hours every day , just achieving a very small amount of tape – knowing what we were doing was different , but losing all sense of whether it was good or not .
Because when you 're that close for so long , you have no yardstick to measure it against . '
Working on the bigger , more complex canvas of television appealed to a different part of Douglas 's brain .
It drew on his professionalism , his problem - solving skills and his delight in the exercise of artful technique .
Script editing Dr
Who had given him plenty of opportunity to see the characteristic faults of novice television writers – and to thank his stars he'd been able to make his early mistakes in the more forgiving medium of radio .
' Hundreds of people who 've never written before send in Dr Who scripts .
They may have good ideas , but what they fail to realise is that writing for TV is incredibly complicated .
They have no idea how difficult it is and what the financial commitment is .
' On the whole , we have to take on people who know a bit about it .
After all , if someone wanted to be a surgeon , you 'd want to know they could take out a neat pair of tonsils before you let them loose on a heart transplant .
From that point of view , radio is the place to start . '
In practice , the original Hitchhiker 's radio series was cobbled together in a much more haphazard way than now meets the eye – and with an arbitrary pragmatism that would have given the TV people the screaming abdabs .
For example , the story of the researcher who found a planet inhabited by all the galaxy 's lost biros ( where they were able to enjoy ' a uniquely biroid lifestyle , responding to highly biro- oriented stimuli ' ) is one of the great solo riffs of Episode 3 , one of Douglas 's two favourite episodes .
Yet it was apparently moved there for the overwhelmingly compelling artistic reason that Ep 3 was ' a bit short ' and its original home was in a show that was running long .
Luckily the storylines in Hitchhiker 's are what one later critic referred to politely as ' blithely episodic ' .
Whether this was originally a matter of cause or effect is hardly important any more .
But despite both being tagged with the SF label , this is one key area in which Dr Who and The Hitchhiker 's Guide to the Galaxy could not have been more different .
After many hours of raking through these old interview tapes , I think perhaps it 's right to end with Douglas 's own description of the strange , looping , frustrating writing process that eventually gave birth to The Hitchhiker 's Guide to the Galaxy – one of the oddest and best - loved creations of the late 20th century .
The way he tells it , it 's a wonder Hitchhiker 's ever saw the light of day .
And it 's certainly a huge sadness that we will never hear that unique voice again , explaining the inexplicable or turning our assumptions inside out in the name of comedy and new perspectives .
' When you 're writing Dr Who , which is conceived purely in dramatic terms , you can plot it thoroughly in advance and know exactly what you 're doing and what scenes are going to go where .
With Hitchhiker 's , you can't do that , because you can't calculate in advance what 's going to be funny .
Every time you do plot a way ahead , you come to write the next scene and you realise it's not going to work as comedy , because it 's not funny .
Then you have to put in an extra element or shove it round this way and that , which means that the plot you just worked out goes out of the window and you have to re-plot it again .
Then the same thing happens again .
So you just do it scene by scene and hope you 're going to get somewhere – and that makes it very difficult to write .
' I tend to write myself into corners .
I 'm in a terrible corner at the moment .
I 've ground to a halt while I try to work out how to get it back on the right lines .
But that 's the continual story of writing this show . '

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - The Internet is the new battleground against Islamist extremism because it provides ideology that could radicalize Westerners who might then initiate home - grown attacks , New York police commissioner Raymond Kelly said on Wednesday .

The Internet is the new battleground against Islamist extremism because it provides ideology that could radicalize Westerners who might then initiate home - grown attacks , Kelly said on Wednesday .

“ The Internet is the new Afghanistan , ” Kelly said , as he released a New York Police Department ( NYPD ) report on the home - grown threat of attacks by Islamist extremists .
“ It is the de facto training ground .
It ’s an area of concern . ”
The report found that the challenge for Western authorities was to identify , pre-empt and prevent home - grown threats , which was difficult because many of those who might undertake an attack often commit no crimes along the path to extremism .
The report identified the four stages to radicalization as pre-radicalization , self - identification , indoctrination , and jihadization , and said the Internet drove and enabled the process .
Radicalization could be triggered by such things as the loss of a job , the death of a close family member , alienation , discrimination , and international conflicts involving Muslims , said the report by senior NYPD intelligence analysts .
“ Much different from the Israeli - Palestinian equation , the transformation of a Western - based individual to a terrorist is not triggered by oppression , suffering , revenge or desperation , ” it said .
“ Rather , it is a phenomenon that occurs because the individual is looking for an identity and a cause and unfortunately , often finds them in extremist Islam , ” said the report “ Radicalization in the West : The Home - grown Threat . ”
While the September 11 strike on the United States by Osama bin Laden ’s al Qaeda network was planned overseas , the report said the attacks had helped proliferate and accelerate radicalization , especially in the West .
“ More importantly , 9/11 established the current trend of committing an act in the name of global jihad as a natural culmination of full radicalization and the ultimate responsibility for the fully radicalized jihadist , ” it said .
But starting the radicalization process does not mean everyone will progress to “ become a terrorist . ”
“ Individuals who have been radicalized but are not jihadists may serve as mentors and agents of influence to those who might become terrorists of tomorrow , ” said the report , which analyzed five home - grown U.S. attack plots .
It says Europe ’s failure to integrate second and third generation immigrants into society , both economically and socially , had left young Muslims more vulnerable to extremism .
While economic opportunities in the United States are better and the country ’s Muslims are more resistant to Islamist extremism , they are “ not immune to the radical message . ”
“ The powerful gravitational pull of individuals ’ religious roots and identity sometimes supersedes the assimilating nature of American society , ” the report said .

Frequently Asked Questions
Revised 27 June 2006
1 . What is the purpose of this newsgroup ?
To provide a forum for discussion of basilisk ( BLIT ) images .
Newsnet readers who prefer low traffic should read comp.
basilisk .
moderated , which carries only high - priority warnings and identifications of new forms .
2. Can I post binary files here ?
If you are capable of asking this question you MUST immediately read news .
announce.
newusers , where regular postings warn that binary and especially image files may emphatically not be posted to any newsgroup .
Many countries impose a mandatory death penalty for such action .
3 . Where does the acronym BLIT come from ?
The late unlamented Dr Vernon Berryman 's system of math - to - visual algorithms is known as the Berryman Logical Imaging Technique .
This reflected the original paper 's title : " On Thinkable Forms , with notes towards a Logical Imaging Technique " ( Berryman and Turner , Nature , 2001 ) .
Inevitably , the paper has since been suppressed and classified to a high level .
4 . Is it true that science fiction authors predicted basilisks ?
Yes and no .
The idea of unthinkable information that cracks the mind has a long SF pedigree , but no one got it quite right .
William Gibson 's Neuromancer ( 1984 ) , the novel that popularized cyberspace , is often cited for its concept of " black ice " software which strikes back at the minds of hackers – but this assumes direct neural connection to the net .
Basilisks are far more deadly because they require no physical contact .
Much earlier , Fred Hoyle 's The Black Cloud ( 1957 ) suggested that a download of knowledge provided by a would - be - helpful alien ( who has superhuman mental capacity ) could overload and burn out human minds .
A remarkable near - miss features in The Shapes of Sleep ( 1962 ) by J.B. Priestley , which imagines archetypal shapes that compulsively evoke particular emotions , intended for use in advertising .
Piers Anthony's Macroscope ( 1969 ) described the " Destroyer sequence " , a purposeful sequence of images used to safeguard the privacy of galactic communications by erasing the minds of eavesdroppers .
The comp. basilisk community does not want ever again to see another posting about the hoary coincidence that Macroscope appeared in the same year and month as the first episode of the British TV program Monty Python 's Flying Circus , with its famous sketch about the World 's Funniest Joke that causes all hearers to laugh themselves to death .
5 . How does a basilisk operate ?
The short answer is : we must n't say .
Detailed information is classified beyond Top Secret .
The longer answer is based on a popular - science article by Berryman ( New Scientist , 2001 ) , which outlines his thinking .
He imagined the human mind as a formal , deterministic computational system – a system that , as predicted by a variant of Gödel 's Theorem in mathematics , can be crashed by thoughts which the mind is physically or logically incapable of thinking .
The Logical Imaging Technique presents such a thought in purely visual form as a basilisk image which our optic nerves can't help but accept .
The result is disastrous , like a software stealth - virus smuggled into the brain .
6 . Why " basilisk " ?
It 's the name of a mythical creature : a reptile whose mere gaze can turn people to stone .
According to ancient myth , a basilisk can be safely viewed in a mirror .
This is not generally true of the modern version – although some highly asymmetric basilisks like B - 756 are lethal only in unreflected or reflected form , depending on the dominant hemisphere of the victim 's brain .
7 . Is it just an urban legend that the first basilisk destroyed its creator ?
Almost everything about the incident at the Cambridge IV supercomputer facility where Berryman conducted his last experiments has been suppressed and classified as highly undesirable knowledge .
It 's generally believed that Berryman and most of the facility staff died .
Subsequently , copies of basilisk B - 1 leaked out .
This image is famously known as the Parrot for its shape when blurred enough to allow safe viewing .
B - 1 remains the favorite choice of urban terrorists who use aerosols and stencils to spray basilisk images on walls by night .
But others were at work on Berryman 's speculations .
B - 2 was soon generated at the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory and , disastrously , B - 3 at MIT .
8 . Are there basilisks in the Mandelbrot Set fractal ?
Yes .
There are two known families , at symmetrical positions , visible under extreme magnification .
No , we 're not telling you where .
9 . How can I get permission to display images on my website ?
This is a news .
announce.newusers question , but keeps cropping up here .
In brief : you can't , without a rarely granted government licence .
Using anything other than plain ASCII / ANSI text on websites or in e-mail is a guaranteed way of terminating your net account .
We 're all nostalgic about the old , colourful web , and about television , but today 's risks are simply too great .
10 .
Is it true that Microsoft uses basilisk booby - traps to protect Windows Ultra from disassembly and pirating ?

There was a time when everyone thought that the Europeans and the Japanese were better at business than we were .
In the early 1990s airport bookstores were full of volumes with samurai warriors on their covers , promising to teach you the secrets of Japanese business success .
Lester Thurow ’s 1992 book , “ Head to Head : The Coming Economic Battle Among Japan , Europe and America , ” which spent more than six months on the Times best - seller list , predicted that Europe would win .
Then it all changed , and American despondency turned into triumphalism .
Partly this was because the Clinton boom contrasted so sharply with Europe ’s slow growth and Japan ’s decade - long slump .
Above all , however , our new confidence reflected the rise of the Internet .
Jacques Chirac complained that the Internet was an “ Anglo - Saxon network , ” and he had a point — France , like most of Europe except Scandinavia , lagged far behind the U.S. when it came to getting online .
What most Americans probably do n’t know is that over the last few years the situation has totally reversed .
As the Internet has evolved — in particular , as dial - up has given way to broadband connections using DSL , cable and other high - speed links — it ’s the United States that has fallen behind .
The numbers are startling .
As recently as 2001 , the percentage of the population with high - speed access in Japan and Germany was only half that in the United States .
In France it was less than a quarter .
By the end of 2006 , however , all three countries had more broadband subscribers per 100 people than we did .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Opposition to the Iraq war is at an all - time high despite reports of a reduction of violence in the country , according to a CNN / Opinion Research Corp. poll released Thursday .
Sixty - eight percent of poll respondents opposed the war , setting a record .
The level of opposition is slightly up from last month and 1 percentage point higher than the previous record of 67 percent , first set in December 2006 in a CNN / Opinion Research survey .
Support for the war in Iraq among Americans has dropped to 31 percent from 34 percent last month , the new poll found .
The last time CNN reported a majority supporting the war was in October 2003 , with 54 percent backing it , according to a CNN / USA Today / Gallup Poll .
Reacting to the CNN poll , White House deputy press secretary Tony Fratto said , " The American people want our troops to succeed in Iraq , and it may take some time for perceptions to change back here , but the evidence on the ground in Iraq is clear :
The surge is succeeding in bringing greater security in Iraq .
" As the president has said , with continued success , we can begin to bring troops home .
As our troops are clearly succeeding on the ground in Iraq , they deserve our undivided support , " Fratto said .
This year has marked the deadliest for U.S. forces in Iraq , corresponding with an American troop buildup and offensives against insurgents in the Baghdad area .
The number of U.S. troops who died reached a peak for 2007 with 126 fatalities in May .
Thirty - eight U.S. troops died in October , the lowest monthly figure this year .
In addition to the recent decline in U.S. military deaths , militant attacks and civilian deaths also have been dropping , U.S. and Iraqi authorities said .
However , those reports do n't appear to have resonated with the public , the poll suggests .
Just one quarter of Americans believe the United States is winning the war , while 62 percent said neither Americans nor insurgents are winning , the latest survey found .
There has been virtually no change in the past month in the number of Americans who believe that things are going badly for the United States in the war in Iraq .
Partisanship may be one reason why the recent reports are not changing public opinion about the war , CNN senior political analyst Bill Schneider said .
Watch how Democrats and Republicans view the war »
" Republicans and Democrats seem to be hearing different news , " Schneider said , noting that 70 percent of Republicans believe things are going well in Iraq compared with 13 percent of Democrats .
Independents tend to agree with Democrats , Schneider said .
President Bush on Wednesday dismissed a reporter 's use of " quagmire " to describe the situation in Iraq , insisting the United States was making progress .
" If you lived in Iraq and had lived under a tyranny , you 'd be saying , ' God , I love freedom , ' because that 's what 's happened , " he said .
" And there are killers and radicals and murderers who kill the innocent to stop the advance of freedom .
But freedom 's happening in Iraq .
And we 're making progress . "
The public also opposes U.S. military action against Iran .
Sixty - three percent oppose airstrikes on Iran , while 73 percent oppose using ground troops in that country , the poll found .
Seventy percent said they oppose any military strike on Iran , slightly higher than 66 percent in 2005 but significantly higher than 23 percent in 2002 in CNN / USA Today / Gallup polls .
Bush has refused to rule out possible military action against Iran for its nuclear ambitions while insisting that diplomacy is the first option .
The president said Wednesday that his strong language was necessary to send " clear signals " to Tehran " that the free world understands the risks of you trying to end up with a nuclear weapon . "
" Iran is as deeply partisan as Iraq , " Schneider said .
" Republicans favor military action .
Democrats oppose it . "
Overall , 56 percent of Americans are dissatisfied with progress in the war on terrorism , representing a steady decline since 2002 , when 24 percent said they were dissatisfied in a CNN / USA Today / Gallup Poll .
The CNN / Opinion Research telephone poll of 1,024 American adults was carried out Friday through Sunday .
The sampling error for the full sample was plus or minus 3 percentage points ; some questions were asked of a half - sample of about 500 respondents and carry a sampling error of plus or minus 4.5 percentage points .

The Golden Compass Vs. The Holy Bible !
A HANDY COMPARISON TIP SHEET FOR CONCERNED CHRISTIAN PARENTS
Most Christians familiar with The Golden Compass ( based on the pornographic scribblings of unrepentant God-hater and -- quite possibly -- heroin addicted child diddler , Philip Pullman ) , know it is an atheist recruitment film marketed towards our precious children .
The film makes clear that Pullman knows only too well that otherwise decent Baptist children will believe that Jesus Christ and His followers are indeed " [ unchristian word ] - sucking mother - [ unchristian word ] ers " when a cuddly Coca - Cola polar bears says it with a smile .
Not only is the film full of cute , enticing , furry animals with mouths like horny sailors on leave in a Shanghai red light district , it exposes youngsters to alarming viewpoints that are anti-religious right , anti-morality , and anti-( just believing what you are damn well told ! ) .
We now live in a world where we have to constantly worry about our children being presented with abhorrent , new ideas that are slightly different than the stuff our parents forced us to believe .
Since , according to the soon to be drummed out of town nitwits at the local court , we can't ban The Golden Compass from being shown in every theater in America outside of Freehold , Iowa - we thought it would be a good idea to present the general , saved public with a handy comparison chart and tip sheet of how to combat the crazy inappropriate ideas presented in this movie with the wonderful and timeless truths we should be eagerly teaching our children from the biggest selling family book with sex and killing ever written : The Holy Bible .
Dangerously Inappropriate Ideas Children Are Exposed To In The Golden Compass : Healthy Ideas Children Are Exposed To In God 's Word , The Holy Bible : The Golden Compass exposes children to alcohol consumption by presenting them with a whiskey - guzzling bear .
The Bible exposes children to actual human beings who drink their own urine and eat their own poop .
Parents will also enjoy reading a wonderful yarn about a poor fellow who walked into his drunk father 's tent to find him buck naked ! " ... hath he not sent me to the men that sit upon the wall , that they may eat their own dung , and drink their own piss with you ? "
Isaiah 36:12
" And he ( Noah ) drank of the wine , and was drunken ; and he was uncovered within his tent .
And Ham , the father of Canaan , saw the nakedness of his father ... "
Genesis 9:21 - 22
The Golden Compass promotes the false notion that children who are born out of wedlock are " a - OK " and can actually end up being someone who matters .
In the Holy Bible , children learn that little boys and girls who are born out of wedlock ( the Bible calls them : BASTARDS ) are to be shunned and we are to have nothing to do with them or their descendents .
" A bastard shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD ; even to his tenth generation shall he not enter into the congregation of the LORD . "
Deuteronomy 23:2
The Golden Compass teaches innocent children that it is possible for witches , specters and ritual magicians to be quite helpful at times .
Little children who read the Holy Bible learn that they are commanded to kill witches and have nothing to do with the occult .
" Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live . "
Exodus 22:18
" There shall not be found among you any one ... that useth divination , or an observer of times , or an enchanter or a witch .
Or a charmer , or a consulter with familiar spirits , or a wizard , or a necromancer . "
Deuteronomy 18:11 The Golden Compass teaches children that bears can talk .
The Bible makes it factually clear to children that only snakes and donkeys can talk .
" Now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made .
And he said unto the woman , Yea , hath God said , Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden ? "
Genesis 3:1
" And the ass said unto Balaam , Am not I thine ass , upon which thou hast ridden ever since I was thine unto this day ?
was I ever wont to do so unto thee ? "
Numbers 22:30
The Golden Compass teaches children that organized religion ( or the " Magesterium " in the movie ) and its devout followers are evil and kidnap little children .
The Bible teaches children that the Jewish Church in the time of Christ produced devout followers called , Pharisees and Sadducees , who hated Jesus and had him killed .
" Ye are of your father the devil , and the lusts of your father ye will do .
He was a murderer from the beginning , and abode not in the truth , because there is no truth in him .
When he speaketh a lie , he speaketh of his own : for he is a liar , and the father of it . "
John 8:44
It is also important to note that The Catholic Church produces devout followers called , " Priests , " who sodomize little children at their leisure .
Children are presented with the notion that a Golden Compass can answer any question .
Children who read the Bible are warned that a person will be punished with unspeakable , blood - curdling terrors and infinite torture if they so much as question or add anything to God 's Word , The Holy Bible !
" For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book , If any man shall add unto these things , God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book . "
Revelation 22:18
We encourage our readers to e-mail us with any other comparisons they think might help Christian parents .
The Golden Compass calls True Christians™ to put on the full , platinum , ornately decorated armor of God and suffer not to spend nine dollars to sit in the badly cushioned seats of America 's picture houses that choose to corrupt our sweet children with filth !
Remember :
The meddlesome local court wo n't let US stop the theaters from SHOWING it , but that does n't mean all who read this article can't hop on down to their local multiplex and stop gullible trash from WATCHING it .
Nobody wants to sit through a long movie being pelted by Bible tracts and pork chops !

The Landover Baptist Parody website is not intended to be viewed by anyone under 18
In the over 20,000 file - sharing cases filed so far , the RIAA has relied on a simple procedure : scour P2P networks for shared music , file a John Doe lawsuit to learn the identity of the account - holder responsible for the IP address flagged by the RIAA 's investigative arm , and , if the account - holder does n't agree to the RIAA 's settlement terms , file a lawsuit using a boilerplate complaint .
A federal judge in California has now refused to grant the RIAA a judgment based on just such a complaint , forcing the RIAA to draw up a new complaint containing specifics .
Yolanda Rodriguez was sued by the record labels for copyright infringement in November of last year .
Apparently , Rodriguez is of the " ignore the problem and hope it will go away " mindset , as she never filed an answer to the complaint , and a search of the case history shows no action on her part to fight the lawsuit .
Given Rodriguez 's inaction , the clerk entered a notice of default this past April .
In July , the record labels asked the court for a default judgment in the amount of $ 3,750 ( five songs at $ 750 each ) plus $ 420 in court costs .
Judge Rudi M. Brewster declined to give the RIAA what it was asking for , ruling that the plaintiffs ' boilerplate complaint " fails to sufficiently state a claim upon which relief may be granted . "
Drawing on the recent Bell Atlantic v. Twombly case decided by the Supreme Court , Judge Brewster held that the RIAA 's complaint was n't sufficient to merit a default judgment .
" [ O ] ther than the bare conclusory statement that on ' information and belief , Defendant has downloaded , distributed and / or made available for distribution to the public copyrighted works , Plaintiffs have presented no facts that would indicate that this allegation is anything more than speculation , " wrote the judge .
" The complaint is simply a boilerplate listing of the elements of copyright infringement without any facts pertaining specifically to the instant Defendant . "
Bell Atlantic v. Twombly involved allegations that the Baby Bells engaged in an anticompetitive conspiracy to hinder local phone and broadband competition .
The Supreme Court ruled that the mere fact that a conspiracy was conceivable and that the companies engaged in conduct that supported the conspiracy allegations was n't enough for a lawsuit to proceed .
Judge Brewster vacated the entry of default but gave the RIAA 30 days to refile the complaint and serve Rodriguez with it .
It took the RIAA little less than a week to file an amended complaint .
In contrast to the original complaint , which was extremely short on specifics , the RIAA 's latest filing offers more in the way of details .
Those details include the date the RIAA spotted the PC it believes was used by Rodriguez on Gnutella , the IP address , and a list of recordings in the user 's shared folder .
There 's still a great deal of " information and belief , " however .
The RIAA is " informed and believe [s ] " that Rodriguez " had continuously used and continued to use a P2P network to download and / or distribute to the public " the files contained in the shared folder as well as " additional sound recordings owned by or exclusively licensed to " the labels .
In fact , the only significant difference between the original and amended complaint are the dates , IP address , the name of the network , and screenshots showing each and every file seen in the shared folder allegedly residing on Rodriguez 's PC .
Of course , if Rodriguez once again fails to show up in court , that may be enough to grant a default judgment .
Judge Brewster 's decision may have ramifications for two contested lawsuits , Elektra v. Barker and Warner v. Cassin .
The judges in both cases have indicated their intention to rule on a central facet of the RIAA 's complaints , that making a song available over a P2P network constitutes copyright infringement .
Copyright attorney Ray Beckerman , who is defending both Barker and Cassin , points out that the judge 's ruling in Interscope v. Rodriguez supports the arguments made in the other two cases .

The NCAA this week released a new set of rules for bloggers at collegiate sports playoffs and championship events , and the new rules are already inviting both criticism and ridicule .
While they may or may not turn out to be short - sighted , they 're actually a step forward for the NCAA , which previously had a policy toward blogging that can only be described as " medieval . "
And not the cathedral - building , monk - beer - brewing , Aristotle - philosophizing " medieval , " either ; think Black Death and Fourth Crusade " medieval . "
Back in June , the NCAA stirred up some negative press for each ejecting a Courier - Journal ( Louisville , Kentucky ) sports reporter from an NCAA super - regional baseball game .
Staffer Brian Bennett had been blogging to the paper 's web site as the game was in progress , despite an NCAA memo circulated in advance of the game that warned against blogging " between the first pitch and the final out of each game . "
Bennett 's press credential was revoked and he was kicked out of the press box .
The newspaper 's attorney later railed against the NCAA , saying , " Once a player hits a home run , that 's a fact .
It 's on TV .
Everybody sees it .
[ The NCAA ] can't copyright that fact .
The blog was n't a simulcast or a recreation of the game .
It was an analysis . "
Six months after that incident , the NCAA has adopted an official " blogging policy " ( PDF ) for its championship events that allows every credentialed reporter to have the " privilege " of blogging during games .
A number of minor conditions are imposed , but the most limiting one concerns the number of posts that can be made during a particular event .
Covering fencing , skiing , or rifle ?
You can blog a maximum of 10 times per event .
Lacrosse ?
Three posts per quarter , with another allowed at halftime .
Basketball gets five posts per half and another at halftime , while football ( Division I - FCS and lower only ; bowl games are run by the NCAA ) gets three per quarter and one at halftime .
This all seems a bit silly ; after all , who 's going to sit around refreshing a blog in place of watching or listening to the game through an outlet that has paid the NCAA money for broadcast rights ?
( The NCAA wants to guarantee the value of its broadcast licenses , and it wants to keep control over the way such events are disseminated . )
But on the other hand , the limits seem pretty reasonable .
If someone is blogging more than 11 times during a single basketball game ( and they 're free to post whatever they want both before and after the action ) , then it's at least within the realm of possibility that the sheer amount of material coming out of the game could be enough to keep some fans from tuning into other , paying media outlets .
Two other notes : this applies only to NCAA - sponsored tournaments , and it applies only to credentialed members of the press .
Blogging about NCAA sports shows passion for the events , and can help foster a community around certain sports .
Marquee events like football , basketball , and baseball may derive little benefit from live - blogging , but the smaller events like fencing , rowing , and bowling certain could .
The NCAA should be encouraging its bloggers , who are n't charging the NCAA a penny for promoting its offerings , not limiting them , especially for sports that still truly are the preserve of amateur scholar - athletes .
Corporate oil giants scramble to plunder Iraq ’s energy reserves
By James Cogan
18 December 2007
When Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki finally sent the so - called “ oil law ” to be passed by the parliament in July , George Bush phoned to congratulate him personally .
Maliki ’s failure to push the legislation through had been a source of growing frustration and anger in Washington for more than a year .
The law was needed to legitimise one of the main aims of the illegal US invasion of Iraq — to allow foreign corporations to assume control over the country ’s state - owned energy resources on the most lucrative of terms .
Bush ’s congratulations — made on behalf of the major oil corporations and their share - holders — were premature however .
The rival Shiite , Sunni and Kurdish factions of the Iraqi ruling elite have still not agreed on the legislation due to their bitter and increasingly intractable differences over how to divide the revenues that would flow to the Baghdad government .
Five months after the law was sent for ratification , it is still tied up in debates within a parliamentary committee , with few indications as to when , or in what form , it will be passed .
Faced with US demands for the opening up of the oil industry , the Maliki government , with Washington ’s support , has turned to a desperate ploy to circumvent the parliamentary impasse .
In a bizarre twist , US - based oil companies are being asked to invest in Iraq on contracts that legally rest on the pre-invasion laws of Saddam Hussein ’s Baathist regime .
The Baghdad government is offering transnationals what oil minister Hussain al - Shahristrani described to UPI ( United Press International ) earlier this month as “ technical support contracts ” over some of the country ’s largest oilfields .
These contracts involve corporations being paid to operate or manage oilfields , rather than having long term control or a share in the profits .
By contrast , the stymied oil law , which was largely ghost written by US oil interests , would legalise production sharing agreements ( PSAs ) , a one - sided contractual arrangement that gives oilfield operators all revenues until they have paid their costs as well as a fixed ratio of all profits .
Iraqi PSAs were expected to guarantee as much as 20 percent of all profits to the operating companies for terms as long as 30 to 40 years , while formally leaving “ ownership ” of the oil and gas in the hands of the “ Iraqi people ” .
Without PSAs , Steve Peacock , a representative of British Petroleum ( BP ) , told Oil and Gas News Magazine last month that major companies would move into Iraq “ if the terms compensate for the skills , tools and experience that international oil companies bring to the table ” .
Peacock stated : “ There are many forms of contract that can find that sweet spot in the middle . ”
The exact terms of the “ technical support contracts ” are not known .
The extent of interest being expressed , however , suggests that the transnationals are being offered a very sweet deal , combined with the longer - term promise of a lucrative PSA once the new legislation is enacted .
As well , they have been given a promise of industrial peace from the Iraqi Federation of Oil Unions , which had called strikes against the proposed oil law .
The union has agreed to allow transnationals into the oil industry under the support contracts .
The focus of contract offerings is southern Iraq , where between 60 - 70 percent of the country ’s proven oil reserves are located .
The area is firmly under the political control of the Shiite parties that dominate Maliki government .
BP is seeking a contract for the major Rumailia field on the border of Basra and Kuwait , one of the country ’s largest .
Chevron and Total have done preparatory work to take over operations of the Majnoon field near the Iraq - Iran border .
UPI ’s sources indicate that ConocoPhillips is seeking a contract for the West Qurna field near Basra , which has reserves of some 14 billion barrels .
ExxonMobil is looking at the Zubair field , also located near Basra .
Royal Dutch Shell and the Australian - South African corporation BHP - Billiton are seeking a contract in the Missan fields in Amara province .
An Iraqi official told Oil and Gas News Magazine that Shell would be paid to “ help in providing new techniques to increase production as well as buying equipment for the field ’s redevelopment ” .
The Bush administration and the Maliki government are both seeking to dramatically boost Iraqi oil production .
Shahristrani , who is considered a political representative of the leading Shiite cleric Ayatollah Ali al - Sistani , outlined plans last month to increase oil production from 2.5 million barrels per day to at least three million by the end of 2008 , and to six million within a decade .
The major oil companies would be the primary beneficiaries but a rise in production would also boost the ability of the Iraqi government to contribute to the upkeep of US occupation forces .
As well , it would generate a substantial flow of wealth to the Shiite elite after decades of being marginalised by the former Baathist regime .
Controversially , companies are also seeking a role in the northern Kirkuk field , Iraq ’s oldest and the subject of a bitter territorial conflict between the Baghdad government and the Kurdish Regional Government ( KRG ) which functions as an autonomous state in northern Iraq .
According to UPI , Royal Dutch Shell has been conducting technical studies of the Kirkuk field since 2005 and wants a contract .
Production is currently as low as 200,000 barrels per day , compared with an estimated potential output of a million barrels .
The KRG is demanding a referendum in Kirkuk province to decide if it will become part of the Kurdish region — which would give the KRG jurisdiction over the oil fields .
Fearful that the central government will sign deals for the Kirkuk field , the KRG has denounced Shahristrani ’s offerings of contracts under the old Baathist laws as illegitimate .
While denouncing Shahristrani ’s offerings , however , the KRG is proceeding to sign its own contracts on the basis of a regional oil law passed unilaterally in August .
At least 20 PSAs have been entered into with international oil companies to develop untapped oil fields in the Kurdish north .
The KRG ’s aim is to attract more than $ 10 billion in investment and push production in the north up to a million barrels per day over the next five years .
The US State Department has generally discouraged US - based firms entering into PSAs with the KRG .
There are concerns throughout the Middle East that the development of the northern Iraqi oil industry would enable the KRG to gain sufficient economic and political clout to begin openly calling for the formation of a greater “ Kurdistan ” including Kurdish areas in Turkey , Syria and Iran .
Turkey , in particular , has issued veiled threats it would militarily act to prevent Kirkuk oil coming under the KRG ’s sway .
Shahristrani , on the behalf the Iraqi government , has labelled the Kurdish contracts as “ illegal ” .
As a consequence , the world ’s major oil companies have been reluctant to enter into arrangements with the KRG so as to not disrupt relations with the Maliki government and hinder their access to the southern oil fields .
The sordid wrangling between factions of the Iraqi elite underscores the fact that the various competing “ oil laws ” are to legitimise corporate profiteering on a vast scale under a US - led occupation that is completely illegitimate and illegal .
Karana Hattersley - Drayton was leading a team of archaeologists through one of the slew of boarded - up buildings in Chinatown , an enclave long abandoned by the people who gave the area its name more than a century ago .
They were there to recover antique ceramics left behind by the former owners of what had been a restaurant and home .
Wearing masks to shield against the stench of human waste from squatters and a sewage break , the team descended into the basement .
They soon found a cache of rare bowls and plates under the wooden staircase .
Then came the unexpected discovery .
The group spotted a dark crawl space obscured by boards on the basement ’s east wall .
Was this evidence of one of Fresno ’s most enduring urban legends ?
Advertisement
Tunnels in Fresno’s Chinatown were rumored to have been so extensive that denizens could traverse the neighborhood without ever seeing daylight .
One tunnel was said to have extended under the dividing railway tracks so that men from the white side of town could reach Chinatown speak - easies undetected .
“ It ’s part of our lore , ” said Hattersley - Drayton , Fresno ’s historic - preservation officer .
Since her team reported its find in August , interest in the “ underground Chinatown ” has exploded .
The city is now using ground - penetrating radar in the adjacent streets , trying to find underground connections between basements with walled - off passageways .
Local groups have led tours , guiding visitors to the basement of a barbershop where mysterious doorways are sealed with concrete .
An opportunistic shop owner raised the price of flashlights that day from $ 1 to $ 15 each .

But the newfound excitement has sparked a backlash .
Experts on Chinese American history say Chinatowns across the nation -- including in many California cities -- have always been rumored to have tunnels , but no proof exists that they were anything more than connected basements .
They say the hype surrounding the legends revives misconceptions that fanned xenophobia in earlier times .
Oral histories and newspaper accounts from the early 20th century include clues that Los Angeles ’ original Chinatown ( where Union Station now stands ) was connected by a web of tunnels leading to brothels , speak - easies and other illicit businesses .
But when the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority dug up the area in 1990 for subway construction , it found artifacts but no tunnels .
Some historians say the tunnel tales originated from a misunderstanding of Chinese culture , and overt prejudice .
“ The 19th century was an extremely racist climate , ” said Phil Choy , past president of the Chinese Historical Society of America and a skeptic of tunnel lore .
“ There had always been an attempt to remove the Chinese .
You had this population of undesirables .
The more mysterious they make us , the better . ”

When Suellen Cheng , a senior curator at the El Pueblo de Los Angeles Historical Monument , first read a report about the Fresno search , she said to herself , “ Here we go again . ”
Cheng used to give guided tours of L.A. 's Chinatown and was peppered with questions about tunnels .
She took the tourists down a dark and dusty corridor , allowing the onlookers to envision all sorts of illicit activities .
Then Cheng would reveal the truth :
The structure had been built by the state in the 1970s to hold utility lines .
“ They ’d tell me I had ruined their day after saying that , ” Cheng said .
But Fresno is different because the tunnel tales are more than just rumors .
Over the last few months , a handful of old - timers have stepped forward to say they saw the tunnels in action .
Their oral histories have given a sense of urgency to the city ’s archaeological effort .

When Fresno’s Chinatown was founded in 1872 , it housed many of the workers who helped build California ’s railroads .
By the turn of the 20th century , the community had expanded to several city blocks and myriad storefronts housing social associations , farm contractors , general goods stores , tailors and druggists .
Chinese accounted for nearly 10 % of the city ’s 12,000 residents .
But by World War II , Chinatown ’s population began to wane significantly as residents moved to growing suburbs .
Many of the buildings that remained were boarded up and have the look of an Edward Hopper painting .
The old Chinese social halls have broken windows .
The oral history of the area diminished as older residents died .
Interest in the district was sparked a few years ago when workers replacing water pipes in the area came across an old underground passage containing a table and some chairs .
But the town really started talking after Hattersley - Drayton ’s team started using the radar .
Residents with stories of underground Chinatown came forward .

One of the first was Rick Lew , who grew up in Chinatown in the 1950s .
Lew said his grandfather was a well - known figure in Chinatown ’s early history , running gambling operations and selling liquor .
In early August , Lew saw a newspaper picture of a man pushing what looked like a lawn mower over a Chinatown alley .
It was one of the archaeologists using the ground - penetrating radar .
He soon called the newspaper and Chinatown Revitalization Inc. , a nonprofit agency assisting in the search .
He wanted them to know where to look .
He said he remembered descending into a roughly 8 - foot - wide walkway under Chinatown as a child .
“ I was probably 2 or 3 years old , ” said Lew , now 57 .
“ My dad was carrying me .
We went to the back room of my grandfather ’s liquor store .
They moved a carpet and there was a trap door .
It took us down to the basement and on the east wall was the entrance to the tunnel . ”
Lew said the floor was dirty , and it was illuminated by dangling lightbulbs .
He recognized people from the neighborhood .
Then he saw two women in Chinese dresses , known as cheongsams .
One was light blue and the other red .
Advertisement
“ Now I can only assume they were prostitutes , ” Lew said .
“ You could n’t buy a cheongsam in Fresno then .
You needed to go to San Francisco . ”
Lew said the tunnel was a few dozen feet long and connected to the next building .
Lew believes tunnels were created as entertainment venues for many of the men that made up the early Chinese communities .
The Chinese were barred from white businesses , and they mistrusted authorities after years of violent mistreatment .
“ It ’s how people survived racism and discrimination , ” said Lew , who builds midget race cars .
“ They were n’t wanted on the other side of the tracks .
So what did you do for fun ?
You ’d go to the tunnels . ”

Gene Sue , whose grandfather came to Fresno in the early 1900s , said he was about 7 in the late 1950s when he had his tunnel experience .
He said he was visiting a family friend who was the owner of a Chinatown dry - goods store .
The friend offered to buy him a snow cone , but instead of walking out of the store and around the block , he and Sue went down to his basement and into a tunnel that led to the basement of the snow cone store .
“ I did n’t think anything of it at the time , but it was this big secret , ” said Sue , 56 .
Like Lew ,
Sue said the tunnel had red brick walls , was about 8 feet wide and had dangling lightbulbs .
“ It was too narrow to just be a basement , ” said Sue , a building contractor .
Jack Enos , a retired Fresno police officer , has never been in a Chinatown tunnel .
But when he walked the neighborhood beat in the 1950s , he would often enter basements and see doorways guarded by metal doors .
He often asked the owners where they led and was told they connected to other buildings across the main alley known as China Alley .
Advertisement
“ I was told you could go underground for four blocks , ” said Enos , 73 .
“ They told me you could run all over Chinatown and never have to run to the surface . ”
Enos said a friend who sold beer used a tunnel to make deliveries .
“ He could service two businesses from one cellar , ” Enos said .
Hattersley - Drayton is collecting the stories and using them to help collect radar data .
She said the radar has shown so - called anomalies under China Alley -- hollow sections too wide to be a sewer or water line .
But she stresses that it ’s too early to tell whether passageways of the kind described by witnesses still exist .
But that has n’t stopped the curious from coming to see what little evidence there is .

In October , Kathy Omachi , vice president of Chinatown Revitalization Inc. , led a tour of one of the neighborhood ’s largest basements .
Forty people had signed up but 60 attended , some giving donations of up to $ 20 .
She guided them down a wooden staircase under a barbershop to a sparse , pitch - black basement large enough to extend under several businesses .
Fire department maps from the turn of the last century showed that “ cribs , ” or beds for prostitutes , used to be housed in the basement .
Exposed nails and low - hanging pipes slowed the curiosity - seekers , some of whom expected to see long , narrow tunnels .
The only clues that there may be tunnels were the sealed brick archways facing the street and neighboring buildings .
Some have been sealed with concrete , others by wooden boards .
One can only assume they lead to something , be it another basement , a tunnel or a sidewalk vault .
“ Basically , we do n’t know , ” Omachi said .

Currently , Wall Street is divided into two camps : those who feel the Fed should fight recession , and those who feel it should fight inflation .
The former feel that a recession can only be avoided if the Fed rescues the economy from the imploding housing market .
To these analysts , inflation is not a problem as it will be contained by slower growth .
The other camp maintains that the housing slowdown is not significant enough to derail the otherwise healthy U.S. economy , and should therefore not distract the Fed from its primary mission of fighting inflation .
As usual on Wall Street , both camps have it wrong .
Both camps incorrectly assume that inflation ( rising prices ) and recession are somehow mutually exclusive .
By concentrating solely on the demand side of the price equation , Wall Street ignores the impact of supply .
In reality , strong growth increases the supply of goods and helps keep a lid on consumer prices .
Weak growth reduces the supply of goods and has the opposite effect .
Similar to the 1970s we are experiencing what economists call " stagflation , " a period when economic contraction occurs simultaneously with high inflation .
Now that Bernanke has pulled the rug out from under the dollar , our currency has become a monetary black hole into which foreign lenders will be increasingly reluctant to trust their savings .
The threat of substantial exchange rate losses will compel foreigners to demand greater compensation for loans to Americans .
Thus what the Fed giveth in lower short - term rates , foreign creditors will take away in higher long - term rates .
Higher long - term interest rates , tighter lending standards , and a reduction in the availability of credit will suppress asset values and consumer spending pushing the economy deeper into recession .
However , as the dollar falls , far fewer foreign products will be imported into the United States , and more domestic products will be exported from the United States .
A reduction in the domestic supply of goods will offset the diminished demand brought about by the recession , causing consumer prices to rise .
So while Americans will indeed buy fewer products , they will pay much higher prices for those that they do .
The bottom line is that consumer prices will be headed much higher , not just despite the recession , but as a direct result of it !
Many economists acknowledge that a falling dollar will put upward pressure on import prices , but few consider its effects on domestically produced goods .
For one thing , a weak dollar by definition raises the prices of globally traded , dollar - denominated commodities , such as oil , causing raw material costs for domestic manufacturers to rise .
Also , as a weaker dollar causes foreigners to demand higher interest rates on the money they lend us , domestic capital cost will rise as well .
Further , a global market allows domestic producers to sell their products to the highest bidders , wherever they may reside .
For example if a lobster fisherman in Maine can get a better price for his catch in Europe , he will sell to Europeans .
A weaker dollar simultaneously makes domestically caught lobster more affordable in Europe as it makes them more expensive here .
As domestic demand falls , foreign demand picks up .
The result is that fewer Americans will eat lobsters , and those who do will be forced to pay more for the privilege .
In addition , many of the products that we export will not be manufactured , adding little to our GDP and creating few jobs in the process .
These products will include used consumer goods , such as cars , appliances , consumer electronics , furniture , etc. Poorer Americans will be forced to sell such possessions so they can afford to buy other goods they will need more , such as food and heating oil .
Of course , armed with more valuable currencies , foreigners will have lots of extra purchasing power with which to buy those used consumer goods Americans can no longer afford to keep , as items such as food and heating oil will be a lot cheaper for them .
In other words , they will be repossessing all the stuff they sold us on credit .
Unfortunately , the choice that we all are currently facing is much more difficult than deciding to fight recession or inflation .
Focusing on one foe at a time is a luxury we have long ago squandered .
In reality , we are facing an assault from all sides .
Our best course would be to hunker down , settle in for a nasty recession , defend our currency , and try to save enough so that when the dust settles we can try to build anew .

It ’s often said that if a politician or newsmaker wants to make sure something gets swept under the rug , they ’ll ensure it drops on a Friday afternoon .
That way , the media gets distracted by other stories by the time Monday rolls around , and they can hope that it gets reported without fanfare .
So what does it mean when a story about government surveillance drops the Saturday before Christmas ?
It means you should pay extra-special attention :
The FBI is embarking on a $ 1 billion effort to build the world ’s largest computer database of peoples ’ physical characteristics , a project that would give the government unprecedented abilities to identify individuals in the United States and abroad .
Digital images of faces , fingerprints and palm patterns are already flowing into FBI systems in a climate - controlled , secure basement here .
Next month , the FBI intends to award a 10 - year contract that would significantly expand the amount and kinds of biometric information it receives .
And in the coming years , law enforcement authorities around the world will be able to rely on iris patterns , face - shape data , scars and perhaps even the unique ways people walk and talk , to solve crimes and identify criminals and terrorists .
The FBI will also retain , upon request by employers , the fingerprints of employees who have undergone criminal background checks so the employers can be notified if employees have brushes with the law .
“ Bigger .
Faster .
Better .
That ’s the bottom line , ” said Thomas E. Bush III , assistant director of the FBI ’s Criminal Justice Information Services Division , which operates the database from its headquarters in the Appalachian foothills .
The goal is a permanent surveillance state , where you know neither how much information they ’ve got on you , have no recourse to get a clear answer , and you never know who is or is n’t watching .
It ’s Big Brother , circa 2008 .
I guess Santa ’s not the only one with a list .
Few people noticed , but China got smaller the other day .
According to new estimates , the colossal Chinese economy that has been making marketers salivate and giving others an inferiority complex may be roughly 40 percent smaller than previously thought : worth $ 6 trillion rather than $ 10 trillion .
That means it lost a chunk roughly the size of Japan ’s output .
What happened was a large statistical glitch .
When comparing the size of economies , economists mostly avoid using the standard currency exchange rates seen in bank windows .
These fluctuate too much , driven by housing woes , trade deficits or presidential popularity .
Economists prefer to use what is known as “ purchasing power parity ”  or P.P.P.  a rate that adjusts for price differences between countries .
Take a 40 yuan serving of noodles at an eatery in Beijing .
If the same dish cost $ 4 at a comparable restaurant in New York , the noodle P.P.P. would be 10 yuan to the dollar .
Calculated using a large basket of goods and services , this ratio allows for a more consistent comparison of economies .
The problem is that the World Bank ’s measure of China ’s rate , everybody ’s benchmark , had been based on a 1980s survey of Chinese prices .
This year , the World Bank did its own survey to update the measure .
While the bank has not published it yet , Albert Keidel of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace extrapolated the figure from another set of exchange rates published by the Asian Development Bank .
Eye - Fi , a new company that makes Wi -Fi camera - memory cards , was formed because of a broken promise .
Three years ago , Yuval Koren , Eye - Fi's CEO , traveled to New York from San Francisco for a wedding .
You know , the kind you see in every single romantic comedy ever made ?
Long - lost friends were reunited , copious snapshots were taken , and everyone pledged to send them along soon after .
" There were lots of good intentions , " says Koren .
" But it never happened . "
We all know why : Booting - up your computer , plugging in your camera , uploading pics to the hard drive and finally choosing what to send to the web is universally annoying .
Koren came home and cornered his geeky friends – some worked at Cisco , others at Wi -Fi vendor Atheros , and a few even labored away at Apple .
He posed a question to them :
Why do digital pictures so often end up trapped inside cameras ?
And then they figured out a way to easily set them free .
Two - and - a- half years of intense work later , they produced a 2 - GB SD memory card mated with a Wi -Fi chip .
Just sync the card to a hard drive or Wi -Fi network , and plug it into a digital camera and start snapping away .
Pics are then routed to the hard drive or to one of 17 photo vendors ( like Facebook or Flickr . )
The card 's software deftly handles scaling and compression while privacy settings at the individual sites allow you to filter what gets published .
The Wi-Fi chip , though , was the technical breakthrough .
Developed by Atheros , it uses 70 percent less power than competing products , allowing it to be comfortably nestled in a standard SD card .
Atheros did n't realize how much its wunderchip could help Koren 's fledgling project .
" They did n’t know about us at first , " explains Koren .
" The software and hardware were still in beta , but we begged for access . "
Atheros eventually agreed and granted Koren access in order to help prove their own technology .
A marriage of innovation and vision may have hatched the Eye - Fi , but something larger is also at work here .
Next - gen Wi-Fi networking is finally allowing lowly hardware to be integrated with web apps and software .
" Businesses realize that device margins disappear quickly , " says Jonathan Gaw , an IDC analyst who covers home networking .
" One way to combat that is to integrate upwards with services via Wi -Fi or Bluetooth .
We ’re going to see networking in all kinds of devices . "
Eye - Fi was able to beat lumbering industry dinosaurs like Kodak and San Disk to the punch on a Wi -Fi-equipped memory card for a couple of reasons .
First , it 's rare for hardware companies to have cross- disciplinary chops in software , which the Eye - Fi development required .
Second , camera makers like Nikon that have toyed with Wi -Fi seem intent on locking in consumers to one particular application or photo platform .
Who cares if you can beam photos around wirelessly if you 're shackled to the same device all the time ?
Eye - Fi is instead laser - focused on a more technically savvy crowd .
" We ’re not talking about grandmas , " says Koren .
" Our customer knows how to get photos out of camera but would rather spend their time captioning and sharing . "
Eye - Fi also goes the extra distance to listen to its customers .
Even now , anyone can log on at eye .
fi com to suggest what other photo platforms should be supported .
Koren is coy about what 's next for the company , but says , " There ’s a lot more that we have in mind .
Keep following what we 're doing . "
We had a chance to catch up with Alexis Ohanian , co-founder of Reddit ( second from the left ) .
Alexis now works as a Product Manager for Condé Nast , the now parent company of Reddit .
This interview comes at an interesting time in the social news world , as Reddit beta changes are going live and Netscape is moving over to Propeller.com :
Thanks for your consideration of this interview for the NowSourcing blog .
It ’s really a pleasure .
1 – How is life after the acquisition ?
For me , not much has really changed .
We ’ve been given a great deal of autonomy an d we all have health insurance now , which is nice .
In fact , whereas my job used to entail everything - not - programming — there are departments full of more talented individuals doing many of the duties a startup has to do much better than I ever could .
It ’s especially nice not having to do accounting anymore .
2 – Is being a product manager for Reddit different from what you thought ?
Frankly , I did n’t know what a product manager was , so I did n’t think anything of it .
( I ’ve been quoted as calling myself a “ project ” manager , but I was later corrected — it should be “ product . ”
I ’m still not sure of the difference . )
3 – Is n’t it kind of weird ?
“ Weird ” as in different ?
Sure .
4 – I know that Evan Williams eventually left Google when Blogger was bought out .
Your thoughts ?
I ’m sure he had a good reason to give up all that wonderful free food .
5 – Reddit seems to have fallen out of favor with many people I speak to about social networking .
People who are new seem to not be able to break in to the community , and other social networks seem to be either larger ( Digg , Netscape ) or faster growing ( Stumbleupon ) .
It seems you ’re using a pretty broad definition of social networking , which is fine , but we ’ve always tried to avoid becoming a “ social networking ” site ( in the “ be my friend and I ’ll be yours ” sense of the phrase ) .
We built Reddit to be a place to go to find new and interesting content online .
If a feature was n’t going to work toward that end , we were n’t going to implement it .
For instance , I do n’t think Reddit would be a much better site if users could poke one another .
I ’m not sure what you mean by “ break into the community . ”
The way we look at it , communities are n’t meant to be “ broken into ” — like a car , home , or my parents ’ liquor cabinet .
In that regard , I ’m happy people are having trouble “ breaking into ” Reddit .
Our unique front page has an inherent resistance to cheating because of the way links actually rise and fall on it ; a determined group of users can’t push a story right to number 1 like on every other social news site — links have to earn a spot on Reddit ’s front page by being consistently voted up over time .
Oh , and in a display of bad timing , Netscape announced the shutdown of it ’s social news site just a day before I got your email .
I suspect the traffic they did have was largely from users who still had netscape.com as their default homepage and thus not the right audience ( and perhaps a few nostalgic Netscape Gold - ers ? )
6 – You seem to have caught on to this when you sent out your survey on when Reddit jumped the shark .
What advice do you have for the new Reddit user ?
The only advice I have is from our user - created reddiquette ( reddit - etiquette ) wiki : https://reddit.com/help/reddiquette
And do n’t spam .
We hate spammers —
Steve especially hates spammers .
7 – How is beta going ?
When do you think we will see the new version of Reddit stable and rolled out ?
The new release is coming out in stages and going well so far ( no downtime yet ) .
I notice you blogged about yesterday ’s update already ; we ’ve already seen a solid number of folks branching out into the new communities we ’ve opened up .
8 – Who would win in a fight : the Reddit Alien , or the Google Doodle ? 🙂
Depends on the Google Doodle , really .
Some holidays I just do n’t think they ’d stand a chance , but others might be a bit more challenging .
They certainly have the advantage of legacy —
I ’ll be the first to admit that the entire idea for changing our logo came from [ their ] logo , I just think I ’ve taken it to excess by doing it so often and so randomly .
Our mascot is from the future , though , which implies that it must survive , since it was able to travel back in time …
Ponder that one the next time you ’re passing the bong .
CHARLESTON , Illinois ( AP ) 
A poorly packaged college application prompted a call to the bomb squad at Eastern Illinois University .
Emergency crews evacuated a campus building Friday , after a postal carrier discovered a disheveled - looking package heading for the college 's admissions office .
" There was no return address , it was poorly written , poorly addressed to the university , there were misspellings , " school spokeswoman Vicki Woodard said Saturday .
" There was some tape over it .
Just the overall appearance was rather strange . "
Explosives investigators X - rayed the package and blocked off a nearby street before they discovered the envelope contained only an application to the 12,500 - student school .
Woodard said the application came from somewhere in northern Illinois , but would not comment on whether the bomb scare would affect the prospective student 's chances of admission .
" I 'm sure it 'll be processed like any other application at this point , " she said .

Here in western Japan , Onomichi Prison , a small facility with a special ward for older inmates , who make up 22 percent of the prison ’s population , is in the vanguard in dealing with this new problem .
But recent visits to two large penitentiaries , one maximum security and the other minimum , underscored the more deep - rooted problems associated with the increase in older prisoners .
A recent Justice Ministry report said that older people were increasingly turning to crime out of poverty and isolation , suggesting a breakdown in traditional family and community ties .
With nowhere else to go , more of the older inmates serve out their full sentences , instead of being released on parole like younger prisoners .
What is more , recidivism is higher among the older inmates .
“ There are some elderly who are afraid of going back into society , ” said Takashi Hayashi , vice director of Onomichi Prison .
“ If they stay in prison , everything ’s taken care of .
There are examples of elderly who ’ve left prison , used up what money they had , then were arrested after shoplifting at a convenience store .
They ’d made up their minds to go back to prison . ”
While the main reason behind the explosion in graying lawbreakers is the rapid aging of Japan ’s population , the rates have far outpaced the increase of older people in the general population .
Between 2000 and 2006 , while the total population of Japanese 60 and over rose by 17 percent , inmates of the same age group swelled by 87 percent .
In the country ’s 74 prisons , the proportion of older inmates rose to 12.3 percent in 2006 from 9.3 percent in 2000 , while the share of those in their 20s declined and in other age groups remained flat .
Japan ’s rates are much higher than those in the West .
America ’s prisons — where those 55 years and over are categorized as elderly — are also graying .
But such prisoners accounted for only 4.6 percent of the total prison population in the United States in 2005 , according to the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics .
THE separation of the wealthiest from the rest of the country is alarming .
But it would be even more alarming if we recognized that income is n’t the only measure of wealth .
Health and education are forms of wealth , too , essential to happiness and a strong society .
Yet in the discussion of America ’s growing wealth gap , they too often go unnoticed .
Disparities in health care and in education are widespread .
In the realm of education , however , there ’s a particularly corrosive shift that ’s taking place , one that has tremendous consequences for the development of America ’s best minds : the growing gap between super - wealthy colleges and universities  and the rest of the academic world .
There is a widening division that gives top colleges and universities a huge financial advantage over their poorer counterparts .
America ’s wealthiest colleges have endowments that are thousands of times greater than those at the least fortunate schools .
The chasm is far deeper than that in other realms .
After all , overpaid chief executives and investment bankers pay inheritance and income tax , so their wealth diminishes over time .
Heavily endowed colleges and universities , however , suffer no such setbacks .
Amherst , Harvard , Princeton , Williams , Yale and other top - tier colleges have per student endowments that approach ( and in some cases exceed ) $ 1 million .
Because they are accredited educational institutions , the gains on their investments go untaxed , adding billions to their coffers each year .

Capuchins : Cooperative and tolerant
But if they saw another monkey getting a grape - a more - liked food - they took offence .
Some refused to work , others took the food and refused to eat it .
Scientists say this work suggests that human 's sense of justice is inherited and not a social construct .
Differential reward experiment
The research was carried out at Emory University in the US , by Sarah Brosnan and Frans de Waal , and is reported in the journal Nature .
" I 'm extremely interested in the evolution of cooperation , " Sarah Brosnan told BBC News Online .
" One of the most interesting areas is the recent suggestion that human cooperation is made more effective by a sense of fairness . "
She wanted to find out if the human sense of fairness is an evolved behaviour or a cultural construct - the result of society 's rules .
So she and her colleagues devised an experiment using capuchin monkeys .
Aware what the other one gets
" We designed a very simple experiment to see whether or not they react to differential rewards and efforts . "
Capuchins like cucumber , but they like grapes even more .
So a system was devised whereby pairs of capuchins were treated differently after completing the same task .
" They had never before been in any sort of situation where they were differentially rewarded , " she said .
" We put pairs of capuchins side by side and one of them would get the cucumber as a reward for a task . "
The partner sometimes got the same food reward but on other occasions got a grape , sometimes without even having to work for it . "
' A highly unusual behaviour '
The response was dramatic , the researchers said .
" We were looking for a very objective reaction and we got one .
They typically refused the task they were set , " Sarah Brosnan said .
" The other half of the time they would complete the task but would n't take the reward .
That is a highly unusual behaviour .
" Sometimes they ignored the reward , sometimes they took it and threw it down , " she added .
They never blamed their partner , say researchers
" They never showed a reaction against their partner , they never blamed them , " Sarah Brosnan said .
Commenting on the results , experts in the subject told BBC News Online that the idea of a long evolutionary history for a sense of fairness was an exciting one .
However , they added that they would like to see more research involving more than just the five subjects tested in the Nature study .
So does our instinctive feeling of fairness predate our species ?
" It may well , " Sarah Brosnan said , and further experiments are planned to see how extensive a sense of justice in the animal world is .
" We are currently repeating the study on chimpanzees , a great ape species , to learn something more about the evolutionary development of the sense of fairness .
" I suspect that there are other non-primate species with tolerant societies that will show the same behaviour . "

I am in Web 2.0 ignorance recovery .
For two months I ’ve been playing catch - up about web 2.0 and social software .
If I say something stupid or ask questions already answered please just comment me a link and I ’ll shut up .
( If you ’re new too , start here ) .
Some folks have criticized blogs for being an echo - chamber : meaning that many blogs simply echo each other and people debate within narrow boundries .
I ’m not making this point , but I am leapfrogging over any echo debates to ask a larger question .
del.icio.us is a canonical example of both social software and Web 2.0 .
Simply put : in this example of social software ( SS ) people mark items that interest them and people can view the results .
Looking at the top marks , it reflects a curious bias .
Take a look :
Exhibit A : the most recent list of most popular del.icio.us items .
Generalizing from top ten lists has many downsides , given long tails and power laws , but it is an easy catalyst for questions .
This list seems not like what ’s popular with most of the people I know , but what ’s popular with the Computer science / web development / blogging crowd ( some of the people I know ) .
Ajax is a development tool .
Ning , the highest ranked item on the list , is a new kind of social software development platform .
Half of the top ten are items reflect the kinds of things the makers of delicious are likely interested in ( I mean come on : Monty python is just a dead give away .
Although the cleaning link made me consider a programmer / OCD connection ) .
This popularity snapshot expresses an interesting kind of bias : the users of this social software reflect the interests of the makers of the social software .
I suspect the majority of delicious users , today , have similiar interests to the makers of delicious .
Exhibit B : Popular delicious tags
Tagging , which is another key aspect of social software , also makes visible some interesting bias effects .
The most popular tags again reflect the interest of people who make the tools .
Web 2.0 and social software is new enough that the early adopters are not just super interested users , but tool builders themselves ( See this for more tags ) .
I am not suggesting why this happens , just making the observation that it may be true .
Exhibit C : Popular 43things.com tags
At another social software project , 43 things.com , there ’s a broader distribution :
Here are my questions :
1 ) Why does one social tagging system have such a different kind of focus ( delicious ) while the other does n’t ?
Delicious and 43 things are both available to the world .
What explans the wide gap in their user ’s interests ?
How do the demographics for Flickr.com , a service believed to be consumer oriented but which many of my thirty something friends have never heard of , compare to other kinds of tools ?
Other kinds of social software ?
Are they younger ?
More affluent ?
Are there generation gaps tied to social software ?
2 ) In using friendster , linked - in , orkut and other social networking tools , I had the experience of meeting the same people in different systems .
It was like being in college and moving the party from building to building ( only without the drugs .
Well , at least on the networks I was invited onto ) .
Did I just not know enough people ?
Or is the social software crowd , today , smaller than we admit ?
Is anyone examining if diversity is growing with size ?
3 ) What are the risks of the frameworks for social software being defined so strongly by early adopters ?
Do the frontier settlers self - interest , and ability to define their world , restrict the kinds of followers than will come ( I think so ) ?
( Insert favorite Mcluhanreference here )
4 ) How does a user new to a social software project establish a sense for how his interest match with the popular interests of the most active users ?
Where are the the tools that let me search against delicious like data to see what ’s popular with people who have traits or interests I care about ?
For example : there will never be a luddite group on meetup.com .
What other hidden biases are there ?
The digital divide as an important but easy example , but there are more subtle ones .
5 ) Are there inherent biases that most active users in social software have ( e.g. technical , high math SAT scores , etc. ) ?
How does this impact how social software should be designed ?
A traditional software designer can shape the design around different , and possibly under - represented , user ’s needs – but if social software is user driven what counterbalances are there ?
6 ) Are the things that interest social software early adopters the same things that will interest more mainstream and diverse people ?
Should anyone care ?
Claim : Video clip shows a mid-1960s imagining of what
technology would be like in the year 1999 .
Status : True .
Example : [ Collected via e-mail , January 2007 ]
This is allegedly a clip of online shopping as envisioned from the 1960 ’s , called “ Shopping in 1999 A.D. ” .
This is allegedly a clip of online shopping as envisioned from the 1960 ’s , called “ Shopping in 1999 A.D. ” .
The video shows online bill paying and PC desktops with flat screen monitors , including a multi-screen display .
Fake or real ?
Origins : Many visionaries who tried to forecast what daily life
would be like for future generations made the mistake of simply projecting existing technologies as being bigger , faster , and more powerful .
They often failed to anticipate that future technologies might take very different forms , might be put to previously unconsidered uses , and might accompany ( or even help bring about ) significant social changes .
The video clip
shown above — an excerpt from a 1967 Philco - Ford production entitled “ Year 1999 A.D. , ”
starring a young Wink Martindale — did a
fairly good job of anticipating some ways ( if not the specific forms ) in which technology might be used in daily life more than three decades in the future .
Concepts such as “ fingertip shopping , ” an “ electronic correspondence machine , ” and others envisioned in this video anticipate several innovations that became commonplace within a few years of 1999 : e-commerce , webcams , online bill payment and tax filing , electronic funds transfers ( EFT ) , home - based laser printers , and e-mail .
As noted , although the technological concepts expressed in the video may be familiar to us , the specific forms used to realize them are somewhat different than their common modern implementations :
The “ fingertip shopping ” the wife engages in imagines the shopper remotely controlling cameras placed in stores to scan merchandise rather than working with virtual representations of stores ( i.e. , web sites ) .
The “ household monitor screen ” is n’t so much a webcam as it is a simple closed - circuit video security system .
The bills and tax forms the husband works with are scanned images of paper forms rather than electronic forms .
The “ electronic correspondence machine ” ( e-mail ) depends on the user ’s writing messages by hand with a pen and a stylus rather than typing them with a keyboard and monitor .
The concepts are nonetheless relatively well - expressed , even if they do n’t quite match up with some of the finer points of modern technologies .
However , the video exemplifies the common flaw of anticipating technological changes but not societal changes — the daily life it depicts is firmly rooted in the mid-20th century American model of women as stay - at - home child rearers and shoppers , and men as breadwinners and heads of household .
Apparently women in 1999 still would n’t be deemed to be up to handling tasks such as banking , bill - paying , and tax preparation , even with the help of electronic devices .

I stopped making public statements in the recent controversy because Eben Moglen started working behind the scenes to ' improve ' what Linux people are doing wrong with licensing , and he asked me to give him pause , so his team could work .
Honestly , I was greatly troubled by the situation , because even people like Alan Cox were giving other Linux developers advice to ... break the law .
And furthermore , there are even greater potential risks for how the various communities interact .
For the record -- I was right and the Linux developers cannot change the licenses in any of those ways proposed in those diffs , or that conversation ( http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/8/28/157).
It is illegal to modify a license unless you are the owner / author , because it is a legal document .
If there are multiple owners / authors , they must all agree .
A person who receives the file under two licenses can use the file in either way .... but if they distribute the file ( modified or unmodified ! ) , they must distribute it with the existing license intact , because the licenses we all use have statements which say that the license may not be removed .
Please see the Read More link for the entire message .
It 's worth your time .
Yes , we 're starting at the beginning to get it in one shot , as written .
So sue me .

It may seem that the licenses let one _distribute_ it under either license , but this interpretation of the license is false -- it is still illegal to break up , cut up , or modify someone else 's legal document , and , it can not be replaced by another license because it may not be removed .
Hence , a dual licensed file always remains dual licensed , every time it is distributed .
Now I 've been nice enough to give Eben and his team a few days time to communicate inside the Linux community , to convince them that what they have proposed / discussed is wrong at a legal level .
I think that Eben also agrees with me that there are grave concerns about how this leads to problems at the ethical and community levels ( at some level , a ethos is needed for Linux developers to work with * BSD developers ) .
And there are possibilities that similar issues could loom in the larger open source communities who are writing applications .
Eben has thus far chosen not to make a public statement , but since time is running out on people 's memory , I am making one .
Also , I feel that a lot of Linux " relicencing " meme - talkin ' trolls basically have attacked me very unfairly again , so I am not going to wait for Eben to say something public about this .
In http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/8/29/183, Alan Cox managed to summarize what Jiri Slaby and Luis Rodriguez were trying to do by proposing a modification of a Dual Licenced file without the consent of all the authors .
Alan asks " So whats the problem ? " .
Well , Alan , I must caution you -- your post is advising people to break the law .
I will attempt to describe in simple terms , based on what I have been taught , how one must handle such licenses : - If you receive dual licensed code , you may not delete the license you do n't like and then distribute it .
It has to stay , because you may not edit someone 's else 's license -- which is a three - part legal document ( For instance : Copyright notice , BSD , followed by GPL ) .
-
If you receive ISC or BSD licensed code , you may not delete the license .
Same principle , since the notice says so .
It 's the law .
Really . -
If you add " large pieces of originality " to the code which are valid for copyright protection on their own , you may choose to put a different and seperate ( must be non-conflicting ... ) license at the top of the file above the existing license .
( Warning : things become less clear as to what the combination of licenses mean , though -- there are ethical traps , too ) .
-
If you wish for everyone to remain friends , you should give code back .
That means ( at some ethical or friendliness level ) you probably do not want to put a GPL at the top of a BSD or ISC file , because you would be telling the people who wrote the BSD or ISC file : " Thanks for what you wrote , but this is a one - way street , you give us code , and we take it , we give you you nothing back .
screw off . "
In either case , I think a valuable lessons has been taught us here in the BSD world -- there are many many GPL loving people who are going to try to find any way to not give back and share ( I will mention one name : Luis Rodriguez has been a fanatic pushing us for dual licensed , and I feel he is to blame for this particular problem ) .
Many of those same people have been saying for years that BSD code can be stolen , and that is why people should GPL their code .
Well , the lesson they have really taught us is that they consider the GPL their best tool to take from us !
GPL fans said the great problem we would face is that companies would take our BSD code , modify it , and not give back .
Nope -- the great problem we face is that people would wrap the GPL around our code , and lock us out in the same way that these supposed companies would lock us out .
Just like the Linux community , we have many companies giving us code back , all the time .
But once the code is GPL'd , we can not get it back .
Ironic .
I hope some people in the GPL community will give that some thought .
Your license may benefit you , but you could lose friends you need .
The GPL users have an opportunity to ' develop community ' , to keep an ethic of sharing alive .
If the Linux developers wrap GPL 's around things we worked very hard on , it will definately not be viewed as community development .
Thank you for thinking about this .

Pay What You Think It ''s Worth - After the Movie？ ！
2007 年12月20 日 04:26 来源： PRNewswire 【字体：大 中 小】
LOS ANGELES , Dec. 19 / PRNewswire / --
How many times have you walked out of a movie , paid your 10 bucks , and said , " That just was n''t worth it " ?
Film director Bret Carr and Publisher Larry Genkin want to make sure that never happens to you again .
Carr invented " Pay What You Think It ' 's Worth " marketing with the experimental theatrical release of his film " RevoLOUtion " , a full year before Radio Head used the same idea to make music history .
Out of desperation , and with a tiny $ 3,000 marketing budget , he rented two theaters in LA and was amazed when " RevoLOUtion " doubled traditional box office averages and grossed 5 % more than if all film goers in attendance had paid the normal ticket prices .
Now , Carr is at again and this time he ''s aiming to bypass Hollywood altogether .
By distributing his critically acclaimed film online he hopes to generate an even larger audience than with traditional theatre distribution .
Perhaps even more unusual , he has formed an exclusive partnership with an industry trade magazine .
After a fortuitous meeting at a tradeshow , Carr and Blogger & Podcaster Magazine ( http://www.bloggerandpodcaster.com) publisher Larry Genkin , conceived of using the magazine and a ' ' Producer ' ' credit to incent the influential bloggers and podcasters to tell their audiences about RevoLOUtion ( http://www.revoloutionmovie.com).
WATCH FREE .
PAY AFTER .
CHANGE HOLLYWOOD .
" This gives bloggers and podcasters a great story to tell -- watch free and if you do n''t like the movie , you do n''t have to pay a dime , " says Genkin .
Truth be told , Genkin and Carr have bigger plans than just one movie .
" RevoLOUtion " is the first of many films they plan to distribute through a new service called VirtualCineplex.com .
" This is a major leveling of the playing field for quality indie films .
Pay What You Think It ''s Worth , combined with online distribution and promotion to bloggers and podcasters is a game changer .
Now talented filmmakers without Hollywood connections or big marketing budgets can tap into the massive worldwide audience bloggers and podcasters can deliver , " says Genkin .
" RevoLOUtion is one of the most inspiring films I ''ve ever seen .
When a film this good , from the writer of five time Oscar Winner THE DEER HUNTER and the composer of ROCKY can ''t get distribution , the wrong people are in charge . "

Like memory , human intelligence is probably not confined to a single area in the brain , but is instead the result of multiple brain areas working in concert , a new review of research suggests .
The review by Richard Haier of the University of California , Irvine , and Rex Jung of the University of New Mexico proposes a new theory that identifies areas in the brain that work together to determine a person 's intelligence .
" Genetic research has demonstrated that intelligence levels can be inherited , and since genes work through biology , there must be a biological basis for intelligence , " Haier said .
The review of 37 imaging studies , detailed online in the journal Behavioral and Brain Sciences , suggests that intelligence is related not so much to brain size or a particular brain structure , but to how efficiently information travels through the brain .
" Our review of imaging studies identifies the stations along the routes intelligence information processing takes , " Haier said .
" Once we know where the stations are , we can study how they relate to intelligence . "
The new theory might eventually lead to treatments for low IQ , the researchers say , or to ways of boosting the IQ of people with normal intelligence .
P-FIT
In their review , Haier and Jung compiled a list of all the brain areas previous neuroimaging studies had found to be related to intelligence , placing greater emphasis on those areas that appeared multiple times .
The list they came up with suggests that most of the brain areas thought to play a role in intelligence are clustered in the frontal and parietal lobes .
Furthermore , some of these areas area also related to attention and memory and to more complex functions such as language .
The pair does not think this is a coincidence .
In their Parieto - Frontal Integration Theory ( P - FIT ) , they suggest that intelligence levels are based on how efficiently these brain areas communicate with one another .
Haier says the new theory sidesteps the sticky question of what intelligence is , something that scientists have yet to agree on .
" In every single study that we reviewed , there was a different measure of intelligence , " Haier said .
" There 's controversy about what is the best measure of intelligence .
There 's controversy over how broad or narrow the definition of intelligence should be .
Our work really goes beyond those questions and basically says that irrespective of the definition of intelligence you use in neuroimaging studies , you find a similar result . "
Earl Hunt , a neuroscientist at the University of Washington , who was not involved in the research , said the P - FIT model highlights the progress scientists have made in recent years toward understanding the biological basis of intelligence .
" Twenty - five years ago researchers in the field were engaged in an unedifying discussion of the relation between skull sizes and intelligence test scores , " Hunt said .
Building upon previous work
Haier and Jung were also behind other important intelligence - related studies .
In 2004 , they found that regions related to general intelligence are scattered throughout the brain and that the existence of a single " intelligence center " was unlikely .
And in a 2005 study , they found that while there is essentially no difference in general intelligence between the sexes , women have more white matter and men more gray matter .
Gray matter represents information processing centers in the brain , and white matter links the centers together .
The finding suggested that no single structure in the brain determines general intelligence and that different types of brain designs can produce equivalent intellectual performance .
Knowing what determines intelligence might lead to treatments for diseases of intelligence like mental retardation , Haier said .
" It would be important to now how intelligence works to determine if there 's any way to treat low IQ , " Haier told LiveScience .
" If you can treat low IQ in mental retardation because you identify something wrong in the brain that 's affecting intelligence , then that raises the question of whether you can raise IQ in people that do n't necessarily have the brain injuries . "
“ Why did that happen ? ” he asked the audience , some of whom were relaxing their brain cells with a mixed drink called a Bunsen Burner .
“ The heat seeped out of it , ” someone yelled .
“ You get an A , ” he said .
The spirit of “ Mr. Wizard ’s World ” has now reached an audience that can legally drink .
The same late - night revelers who spent their high school and college years plodding through mandatory science classes are now gathering voluntarily to listen to presentations on principles of string theory or how orbitofrontal cortexes work  as long as it takes place far from the fluorescent lights of classroom .
Science groups for young professionals who do n’t wear white coats , like the year - old Secret Science Club at Union Hall , are cropping up in bars and bookstores all over the country , from Massachusetts to Montana .
“ If you have a certain type of job , after a while that part of your brain starts to deteriorate , ” said Amy Lee , 25 , who works at an Internet startup and was attending her second Secret Science Club meeting .
“ You want to use it again .
Plus , there ’s alcohol . ”
About 50 groups , with names like Science on Tap and Ask a Scientist , have formed in the last four years .
There are three in New York City alone .
Each month , they invite scientists , usually professors at nearby universities , to lecture on topics as varied as mass extinctions and frog mating calls .
Anywhere from 50 to 100 people , none of whom wear pocket protectors , show up for an evening of imbibing hard science along with hard liquor .

Facebook HEBRON , West Bank ( AP )  Israeli security forces armed with sledge hammers , chain saws and power clippers smashed through the fortified doors of a building in the holy city of Hebron on Tuesday to evict two Jewish settler families and hundreds of supporters .
The military operation was meant to reduce conflict between settlers and Palestinians in the volatile West Bank town , but it also highlighted the growing schism between some religious soldiers and an army command that orders them to carry out evacuations they deplore .
Settlers spit and hurled stones , water and oil as police , backed by soldiers , broke through the reinforced doors and dragged the squatters out one by one .
Three settlers had sealed themselves inside a concrete bunker , and it took three hours to drill through a wall to get them out .
Danny Poleg , a police spokesman , said four soldiers , 14 police officers and 12 settlers were injured during the evacuation .
Eleven settlers were briefly detained and two arrested .
The scenes were reminiscent of the forced evacuations of thousands of settlers from Gaza and parts of the West Bank two years ago .
Many of those settlers also resisted leaving and had to be dragged screaming and crying from their homes .
Israeli Vice Premier Haim Ramon , a key ally of Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert , said last month that unlike the unilateral pullouts of 2005 , a future West Bank withdrawal should be part of a negotiated peace settlement with the Palestinians .
He said he foresaw Israel pulling out of most of the West Bank , except for a few large clusters of settlements .
But such a pullout would likely enrage settlers , many of whom angrily protested Tuesday 's action in Hebron .
Noam Arnon , a spokesman for the Hebron settlers , called Tuesday 's evacuation a " crime against justice and against Jewish history . "
" I am sure we will return .
Hebron has a long history and we will return , " he said .
A joint statement by the umbrella committee of rabbis in the West Bank praised the settlers for what it called " their just and moral struggle against a corrupt government which has no values . "
An Israeli watchdog group opposed to the settlements , meanwhile , accused them of creating a media circus to try to deter the government from carrying out future clearances .
" The next time the government will think twice about evacuating people , " said Yariv Oppenheimer , a leader of the Peace Now group .
Hebron , a frequent flashpoint of tensions between Israelis and Palestinians , is home to about 500 Jewish settlers living in heavily guarded enclaves among some 160,000 Palestinians .
Clashes between the sides are frequent .
Jews lived in Hebron for centuries until they were driven out by Arab riots in 1929 .
Some families returned but were ordered to leave by British authorities at the outbreak of a 1936 Arab revolt .
Jordan took over the city following the 1948 Arab - Israeli war .
After Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan in 1967 , fundamentalist Jewish nationalists led the move to resettle Hebron .
Israel now controls the center of the city , including a disputed area that is holy to both Jews and Muslims — the traditional burial site of the biblical patriarchs Abraham , Isaac and Jacob and three of their wives .
Its large military presence often hinders the movement of Palestinians .
The Palestinians control the rest of Hebron , and the city 's Palestinian mayor has demanded the settlers be removed .
The two - story building evacuated Tuesday stands in the downtown marketplace , which the army shut down in 1994 after Jewish militant Baruch Goldstein killed 29 Palestinians in a shooting spree at the Tomb of the Patriarchs .
Settlers claim the property was owned by Jewish families for decades until it was seized by Jordanian authorities after the 1948 war .
The settlers initially moved into the structure — a vacant store — more than six years ago , evacuating and re-entering it as the case made its way through the Israeli court system .
Israel 's Supreme Court ruled in April that the settlers ' presence there was illegal , but they ignored orders to leave .
Hundreds of supporters moved into the building in recent days , reinforcing the doors and windows with metal and concrete in preparation for the raid .
The operation followed the highly publicized refusal of several Orthodox Israeli infantry soldiers to take part in the evacuation .
The army sentenced a dozen soldiers , including two commanders , to brief jail terms for the rebellion .
The eviction of settlers has fed a growing schism between the army command and religious conscripts , many of whom serve in combat units .
Tensions spiked during Israel 's withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and part of the West Bank in 2005 , and again the following year when Israel uprooted part of an unsanctioned West Bank outpost .
Some of the soldiers who took part in those operations were themselves settlers and wept as they carried out their orders .
Some said they were later ostracized by their communities and assaulted by angry neighbors .

Rupert Murdoch 's management shakeup at News Corporation paves the way for a titanic battle between the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times , one of the mogul 's former lieutenants predicted today .
" The biggest newspaper battle of the early part of the 21st century is about to begin , " said Andrew Neil , the former Sunday Times editor and long - time Murdoch - watcher .
" Murdoch has got his sights on the New York Times , " added Neil , in an audio interview with the Guardian 's Matt Wells .
" He wants to gear the Journal up to take on the New York Times in what is now his home city .
That 's what gets his juices going , that 's why he is bringing in all these resources from the far flung reaches of his empire to concentrate on New York . "
Murdoch is moving one of his longest serving lieutenants , Les Hinton , the executive chairman of News Corp 's UK newspaper subsidiary News International , to be chief executive of WSJ publisher Dow Jones .
And News Corp is also expected to confirm today that Times editor Robert Thomson will move to New York with Hinton to take up an executive job with responsibilities including the role of WSJ publisher .
News Corp 's $ 5 bn takeover of Dow Jones will be completed next week .
Neil said Murdoch was less worried about the Financial Times , regarding it as " largely irrelevant " .
But the New York Times should not be overly concerned that Murdoch was coming its way , Neil said .
" I do n't think the New York Times needs to quake in anybody 's boots including its own .
It 's the most powerful newspaper franchise in the world .
But they do have a new - or older - kid on the block fired up and ready for action .
" And you know something ?
It will do the New York Times a world of good .
These big American city newspapers are often lazy monopolies . "
However , the New York Times executive editor , Bill Keller , has downplayed the threat from Murdoch .
Speaking to MediaGuardian.co.uk last week after he gave the Hugo Young memorial lecture , Keller said : " I do n't believe in panic and I do n't see any cause for panic .
" Obviously I see him as a competitor .
But we compete with the Wall Street Journal now .
" By the nature of what the [ New York ]
Times is , a newspaper that is defined largely by the breath of its ambition ... we attempt to be a full service newspaper .
We compete with everybody .
And we are pretty good at it . "
Keller , who was appointed the paper 's executive editor in 2003 , said that he did not want to sound " complacent or arrogant about a new competitor " .
" I do n't really know what he is going to do , " he said .
" I do n't know Rupert Murdoch , he is a combative 76 - year - old newspaper guy with a tabloid soul and more money than God .
" With those resources at this stage it looks like he will do whatever the hell he wants to do .
I do n't think he is going to be constrained by some strategic planning consultant telling him what he can do .
That makes him very hard to predict . "

It is not an opportune time to start an online gambling site for checkers .
In July , researchers at University of Alberta “ solved the game ” using brute computer force .
As such , their computer knew the best strategy to play in any of the possible 50 billion checker positions .
Humans should now be very scared to bet money against any virtual opponent , for fear that they are really facing the Alberta computer or its clone .
( You also would n’t want to play a money game against a computer in Connect Four or Othello , or even backgammon . )
What ’s true for checkers is also becoming true for poker .
The same group at Alberta has just shown that their Polaris program is on the verge of taking down poker professionals .
In the recent “ Man vs. Machine ” Poker Championship , Phil “ The Unabomber ” Laak and Ali Eslami barely beat Polaris two sessions to one ( with one a virtual draw ) .
After the tournament , Laak candidly acknowledged that “ the bots are closing in . ”
People have expressed worry that computerized competition and game - theoretic solutions could psychologically depress player enthusiasm .
What ’s the point of playing checkers now that we know it should always end in a draw ?
What ’s the thrill of playing chess , when we humans know that we can never be the best ?
But the rise of gambling bots may soon depress online poker participation for a very different reason .
In the very near future , online poker may become a suckers ’ game that humans wo n’t have a chance to win .
Bots are quite scale - able and it will be virtually impossible to prohibit computer or computer - assisted online playing .
Poker sites are trying to assure customers that they will kick bots off their site and seize their assets .
But unlike the statistical trail left by crude poker cheats at Absolute Poker , it is possible for bots to randomize their strategies and even hire individual humans to run them .
Ultimately the Albertus Polaris program and its offspring could be more effective than any Justice Department indictment in crippling the growth of online gambling .
Indeed , our government might even think about subsidizing the development and use of these bots .
Imagine a DARPA - like competition for creating a bot that can beat the average law breaker .
Constructing a bot that can consistently win ( and then publicizing this fact ) is a sure step toward virtual temperance .
( By the way , I ’m agnostic about whether online poker should be illegal . )
Poker enthusiasts have argued for online legalization , saying that poker is a game of skill .
And of course , it is ( just like chess and checkers ) .
But ironically , it ’s because poker is a game of skill that humans ’ chance of winning are undermined .
Unlike checkers , the key to poker is to predict whether other players are bluffing .
On the Internet ( without the possibility of visual cues ) , computers are probably better at predicting a rival ’s hand from his or her past play .
But computers are much better at confounding the expectations of their human opponents .
Computers can play randomized strategies much better than we can .
Our brains are so hardwired to see patterns , it ’s devilishly hard for most of us to generate random behavior .
Indeed , take a minute and try to write down a random sequence of 200 heads or tails .
If you actually flip a coin that many times , there ’s a very large chance ( 98 % ) that there will be a run of at least 6 heads or 6 tails in a row .
But very few people can bring themselves to produce such runs in trying to be random .
Your iPod ’s shuffle function is n’t broken when it plays songs from the same artist two or three times in a row .
By chance , runs do happen .
When I play poker , I use my watch as a crude random number generator .
Before my first bet , I look down and bluff if the second hand on my watch is between :00 and :06 .
Unlike machines , people have a hard time ignoring the past .
Our biggest tells are n’t facial tics but that we just ca n’t stop ourselves from playing non-randomly .
With training , we can get better , but we should fool ourselves .
The handwriting is on the wall .
High quality bots are an online gambler ’s worst nightmare .
Bots wo n’t kill poker .
They ’ll just drive it off line .
Old fashioned “ humans - only ” competitions will still thrive .
But this is one Darwinian struggle where the unaided human mind is definitely not the fittest .
Yep .
Right about the - 1:25 mark where he says " real quick . "
Fine to attack NBC but when your guest pulls out a mirror , Glenn ?
Cut. Him .

More about this lovely episode at The Largest Minority , h/t Manila :
Professional Jackass Glenn Beck had [ FAIR's ]

UPDATE : ( John Amato ) Norman Solomon emailed me this response for our post :
Maybe people in glass skyscrapers should n’t throw stones , but in the cranked - up world of cable TV they often try .
When I went “ live to tape ” with Glenn Beck last week on CNN Headline News -- with Beck eager to denounce NBC for kissing up to its parent company General Electric -- I was glad to toss some stones back in CNN ’s direction , though I doubted the segment would actually air intact .
But it did , cycling through all three national feeds of Beck ’s nightly show .
From there it went to YouTube , where the views are now steeply escalating .
With conglomerate “ news ” outlets routinely self - protected from direct challenge , any semblance of real debate via corporate media is rare ...

The parade of political tourists to Iraq in recent weeks , during which easily impressed pundits and members of Congress came to be dazzled by the wonders of the troop surge , probably ensures that this murderous adventure will continue well into the next presidency — even if the Democrats win .
For example , Kenneth Pollack , a top national security adviser in the Clinton administration whose 2002 book , “ The Threatening Storm : The Case for Invading Iraq , ” convinced many Democratic politicians to support the war , now finds renewed optimism after the surge .
In a July 30 New York Times Op - Ed article , “ A War We Just Might Win , ” which he coauthored after spending eight days in Iraq , Pollack gushed , “ We traveled to the northern cities of Tal Afar and Mosul .
This is an ethnically rich area , with large numbers of Sunni Arabs , Kurds and Turkmen .
American troop levels in both cities now number only in the hundreds because the Iraqis have stepped up to the plate .
Reliable police officers man the checkpoints in the cities , while Iraqi army troops cover the countryside . ”
So much so that a town 40 miles northeast of Tal Afar was the scene , on Aug. 15 , of the deadliest attack of the war — a quadruple bombing left more than 500 dead and 1500 wounded , and most of the buildings in ruin .
What about those “ reliable ” police officers and Iraqi army troops whose presence in the area Pollack found so reassuring ?
If Pollack was asked about that on any of the talk shows that routinely feature him as an expert , I have not found the footage .
Other Democrats brought to Iraq for photo - op visits have similarly descended into total myopia .
Take Rep. Jerry McNerney , D - Calif. , who is suddenly more upbeat about the future U.S. role in the region : “ If anything , I ’m more willing to find a way forward , ” he enthused .
Rep. Tim Mahoney , D - Fla. , proclaimed that the U.S. troop surge “ has really made a difference and really has gotten al - Qaida on their heels . ”
Odd , then , that al - Qaida was blamed by the United States for that deadly attack near Tal Afar .
In the past week , two Iraqi governors have been assassinated in incidents attributed to intra-Shiite violence that is dramatically on the rise .
But not even this bloodshed stops yet another Democratic lawmaker , Brian Baird , D - Wash . , from proclaiming that he will no longer support measures to set a deadline for troop withdrawal , because “ We are making real and tangible progress on the ground . ”
Contrast the rosy optimism of those day tourists with the assessment of seven active - duty soldiers coming to the end of their 15 - month tour of duty on the ground in Iraq .
They had an Op - Ed piece in the Aug. 19 New York Times entitled “ The War as We Saw It ” :
“ To believe that Americans , with an occupying force that long ago outlived its reluctant welcome , can win over a recalcitrant local population and win this counterinsurgency is far - fetched .
As responsible infantrymen and noncommissioned officers with the 82nd Airborne Division soon heading back home , we are skeptical of recent press reports portraying the conflict as increasingly manageable and feel it has neglected the mounting civil , political and social unrest we see every day . ”
Get their article — excerpted quoting cannot do it justice — and hand it to anyone who prattles on about how “ our ” leaving Iraq will only make matters worse .
“ Four years into our occupation , we have failed on every promise , while we have substituted Baath Party tyranny with a tyranny of Islamist , militia and criminal violence , ” they wrote .
“ In the end , we need to recognize that our presence may have released Iraqis from the grip of a tyrant , but that it has also robbed them of their self - respect .
They will soon realize that the best way to retain dignity is to call us what we are — an army of occupation — and force our withdrawal . ”
In the meantime , the seven soldiers urge that we let “ Iraqis take center stage in all matters ” and “ let them resolve their differences as they see fit .
This suggestion is not meant to be defeatist , but rather to highlight our pursuit of incompatible policies to absurd ends without recognizing the incongruities . ”
The plea ends with “ We need not talk about morale .
As committed soldiers , we will see this mission through . ”
And sadly enough , they will continue to be sacrificed to a policy that makes no sense to them as well as to most other Americans .
As their Op - Ed piece recounts , “ one of us , Staff Sergeant [ Jeremy A. ]
Murphy , an Army Ranger and reconnaissance team leader , was shot in the head during a ‘ time sensitive target acquisition mission , ’ on Aug. 12 ; he is expected to survive . ”
But what about the next good man sacrificed to the whims of politicians and pundits ?

Conyers requests Justice Department info on Halliburton rape cover - up Adam Doster
Published : Tuesday December 11 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers , Jr. and Rep. Ted Poe ( R - TX ) sent a letter today to the Justice Department calling for information on the status of a Department inquiry into the alleged rape of a 22 - year - old Jamie Leigh Jones , a female Halliburton / KBR employee who , according to ABC News , was held captive two years ago in Baghdad and told that she would be fired if she left for medical care .
 We are writing to follow up on the letter sent yesterday by Representative Poe concerning the Department 's response to American Jamie Leigh Jones ' report that she was assaulted and raped by fellow employees of Halliburton / KBR in Baghdad ,  the letter says , and that in the aftermath of this assault she was imprisoned under armed guard for over 24 hours without food or water . 
In their memo , the two Representatives call the news deeply troubling  and argue that it raises broader questions about the Justice Departments role in enforcing laws protecting Americans who are working in Iraq . 
Requesting Attorney General Michael Mukasey respond no later than December 18 , Conyers and Poe conclude with a series of questions .
They ask whether the Department thinks it has jurisdiction to investigate and prosecute if the accusations are accurate , if the Department has investigated Ms. Jones ' claims and if so , what the status of the query is , and if the Department issued an instruction to KBR to cease its own investigation by U.S. government authorities because " they were assuming sole responsibility for the criminal investigations . "

MINNEAPOLIS ( AP ) -- Minutes after Adrian Peterson lost a fourth - quarter fumble at the San Diego 20 - yard line , the ball was back in his hands .
He rumbled around right end , paused to set up his blocks , and sprinted 46 yards up the sideline for Minnesota 's game - clinching touchdown .
This rookie does n't make many mistakes .
He simply sets a lot of records .
The sure - fire candidate for NFL Rookie of the Year now must be considered an MVP threat .

Racing to the NFL 's single - game rushing record of 296 yards at the midpoint of his first pro season , Peterson carried the Vikings to a 35 - 17 victory over the Chargers on Sunday .
He did n't realize the significance of his performance until his benign 3 - yard carry took the clock under 60 seconds and sent him past Jamal Lewis ' 295 - yard performance against Cleveland in 2003 for the best game a running back has ever had in this league .
" Oh , no .
I was out playing ball , " Peterson said .
" I was n't thinking about the record at all . "
There are more for him to ponder .
• On 30 carries , Peterson topped 200 yards rushing for the second time in one season , a feat no other rookie has accomplished .
• Peterson scored two of his three touchdowns and gained 253 yards in the second half , helping the Vikings rally from a 14 - 7 deficit .
They trailed at the half after Antonio Cromartie plucked a missed field goal out of the air and returned it 109 yards for a touchdown , the longest play in NFL history .
• Peterson reached 1,036 yards rushing this season , a pace that would smash Eric Dickerson 's rookie record of 1,808 yards set in 1983 .
Dickerson 's all - time record of 2,105 yards in 1984 is also in reach .
" I set my bar high , because I know anything is possible when you continue to work hard , " Peterson said .
Minnesota ( 3 - 5 ) pressured Philip Rivers into one of the worst games of his career and made sure LaDainian Tomlinson did n't come close to matching Peterson 's performance .
Tomlinson rushed 16 times for 40 yards , and Rivers went 19 - for - 42 for 197 yards with one interception .
He lost one of his three fumbles , two of which were dropped snaps .
" It 's not defense or offense .
It 's all of us , " Rivers said .
" Obviously we were given plenty of opportunities , but we did n't do enough . "
San Diego ( 4 - 4 ) lost a November game for the first time since 2003 and reverted to the shaky play on both sides of the ball that led to a 1 - 3 start .
The defense that ranked seventh in the league against the run was thoroughly beaten .
" I have been in this league too long to use the word embarrassed , " coach Norv Turner said .
Quarterback Tarvaris Jackson got hurt again , and backup Brooks Bollinger was much better in the second half .
That included a 40 - yard touchdown pass to Sidney Rice that put the Vikings in front 21 - 14 .
But it 's easy to look good handing off to Peterson .
" I felt like I was back at Wisconsin , " said Bollinger , who handed off to Heisman Trophy winner Ron Dayne plenty of times as a freshman in 1999 .
After Peterson 's fumble , the Chargers recovered with 10 minutes left and trailed only 21 - 17 .
Minnesota 's defense , which came into the game allowing the most yards passing in the league , forced another three - and - out and San Diego 's eighth punt of the afternoon .
Mewelde Moore returned it 42 yards , and Peterson needed only one play to put the game away and again show off his unique blend of power , speed and instinct .
Rivers threw an interception , Chester Taylor followed with a short touchdown run , and the Vikings suddenly led by 18 -- reaching 35 points for the first time in 24 games under coach Brad Childress .
" That 's the way I like to play football , " Childress said .
" I do have a healthy respect for being able to run it and take somebody 's will from them . "
The Vikings took possession at their 20 with 2:24 remaining in the first half with all three timeouts , but they mismanaged the clock again and let it move under 40 seconds when Jackson ran from the pocket .
He was knocked out of the game with an apparent neck injury during the tackle .
Bollinger came in and moved them close enough for Ryan Longwell to try a 57 - yard field goal .
It was on line , but just short -- leaving Cromartie room to leap and catch the ball without stepping out .
Cromartie ran it back all the way , without being touched , and in the process gained 18 more yards than his team did on offense in the entire half .
Childress was so mad he chucked his headset off , but that was a short rant .
Rivers , on the other hand , spent most of the game complaining to the officials .
The Chargers continually cost themselves field position with ill - timed penalties and made plenty of mistakes on both sides of the ball .
" That 's part of the game , " Rivers said , downplaying his emotions .
" I was frustrated the way we were playing .
We just did n't make enough plays to win , and that 's what every game is . "
Game notes
Peterson 's 315 total yards were more than nine of the 17 other teams who played in the same time slot Sunday : Kansas City ( 234 ) , San Diego ( 229 ) , Denver ( 303 ) , San Francisco ( 251 ) , Atlanta ( 286 ) , Arizona ( 195 ) , Cincinnati ( 299 ) , Carolina ( 199 ) and Tennessee ( 236 ) .
...
Tomlinson , in just his seventh NFL season , passed Jim Brown for fourth place on the NFL 's list for rushing touchdowns with 107 .
Emmitt Smith , Marcus Allen and Walter Payton are the top three .
After posting on recent hyperbole I received several comments from men telling me that the results of the case were instantly obvious .
What these men do n't understand is that their falling back on what is obvious tells me that they have a high tolerance for injustice .
Obvious means first impressions which are based on people 's bigotry .
Sometimes what is obvious is true and meaningful , sometimes what is obvious is true and meaningless , and sometimes what is obvious is false .
This means that what is obvious really tells us absolutely nothing about a given criminal case .
The reason those who focus their concern only for men accused of rape buy into this way of thinking is simple .
When what is obvious is applied to reports of rape , it favors rapists and those who proclaim that half of all rape reports are false .
It stops many investigations before they 've begun .
Stamp many rape reports " unfounded " and call them case closed .
Justice served -- or so it seems from the perspective of these people .
If this obvious standard ever turns against favored men accused of rape , we hear howls of protest .
How dare people pre-judge defendants !
While restating their own rush to judgment , they will protest rushing to judgment .
Do n't we know that pre-judgment is to be used against alleged rape victims only ?
Unlike the numerous victims of rape who are turned away from the criminal justice system from a faulty rush to judgment , the men , both innocent and guilty , who do n't have reports against them blocked at the initial report still have many legal protections .
Yet many of the defenders of the obvious pretend this simply is n't true .
In a recent case where a Minneapolis College of Art and Design grad student was murdered , it was obvious that the murdered woman 's husband was out of town when she was found stabbed about 15 times and suffered from blunt force trauma .
He had taken a flight to New York early in the day and her body was found late that day .
The obvious conclusion would be that he had an airtight alibi .
But the police did not rely on what was obvious and her husband was investigated and has now been charged with her murder .
Rather than relying on what is obvious , we need to rely on investigations and our system of checks and balances .
This system of checks and balances is what was at work when Nifong was disbarred and found in criminal contempt .

Opposition leader 's assassination ' moves us closer ' to potential nuclear apocalypse , expert says Nick Juliano

Print This Email This Predicts Pakistan will not dissolve , but US lacks options dealing with nuke - armed country
The death of Pakistani opposition leader Benazir Bhutto has left the US lacking in options for dealing with the tumultuous , nuclear - armed , militant - rich nation and has raised the possibility that the country 's weapons will fall into the wrong hands , leading to a possible apocalypse , a foreign policy expert tells RAW STORY .
" When people are n't looking , you have a question of command and control of their nuclear warheads , " Steve Clemons , a senior fellow at The New America Foundation , said in an interview Thursday .
Clemons said Bhutto's assassination could cause the " Doomsday Clock " to tick forward .
The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists maintains the clock , which depicts how close the world is to midnight , representing a nuclear catastrophe .
At the beginning of this year , the clock was set at 11:55 p.m .
" I think we 've moved closer to midnight ... to a potential apocalyptic situation , " Clemons said .
" It does n't mean we 're going to get there , but we have moved closer . "
Based on conversations he's had with associates of Bhutto , Clemons predicted the country " would not disintegrate . "
However , he told RAW STORY that Bhutto's death likely would prevent next month 's scheduled election and could lead to more security crackdowns against Pakistani citizens .
As for the US approach toward Pakistan , options are now " very , very narrow , " he said .
" It blows up America 's effort to manage the Pakistan mess .
...
Now we do n't have an alternative to Musharraf , " Clemons noted .
" The timing of this is amazingly bad ; she probably would 've been elected Prime Minister next week . "
Other observers were more pessimistic about Pakistan 's future now that Bhutto is dead .
" The impact will be that Pakistan is in more turmoil -- it will be the start of civil war in Pakistan , " said Riaz Malik of the opposition party Pakistan Movement for Justice , according to The Guardian .
" There is a very real danger of civil war in Pakistan . "
Questions have swirled around potential flaws in Bhutto 's security detail .
The former prime minister , who had recently returned to Pakistan after years in self - imposed exile , was shot at close range by a gunman , then hit with shrapnel from a suicide bomb , according to news reports .
It was the second attempt on her life since her return .
Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden , chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , implied in a statement Thursday that more could have been done to protect Bhutto .
 This fall , I twice urged President Musharraf to provide better security for Ms. Bhutto and other political leaders 
I wrote him before her return and after the first assassination attempt in October , " Biden said .
" The failure to protect Ms. Bhutto raises a lot of hard questions for the government and security services that must be answered . "
Clemons said that , both Bhutto and Musharraf were seen by the average Pakistani as US " puppets , " but that now the US has no option except Musharraf in trying to quell an increasingly unstable country .
Musharraf himself is believed to be under threat of assassination attempts by foreign extremists because of his perceived closeness to the US .
At the same time , he has come under fire from American politicians for not doing enough to root out elements of al Qaeda believed to be hiding in Pakistan .
Whatever happens , a resolution of the turmoil seems farther away that it was Wednesday night , while threats are still prevalent within Pakistan .
" It 's going to take time , " Clemons said .
" And we still have a nuclear Pakistan with Osama bin Laden and [ Ayman al - ] Zawahiri residing in their country . "

Print This Email This President Bush , Karl Rove , and other top administration officials were " involved " in misleading the White House press corps about the outing of ex-CIA agent Valerie Plame , a forthcoming book from former Press Secretary Scott McClellan alleges .
Entitled What Happened , the new tell - all features McClellan 's account of his days as the White House 's top spokesman -- including a behind - the - scenes look at the Bush administration 's handling of the Plame affair , according to a tantalizing excerpt from the book released on its publisher 's website .
" The most powerful leader in the world had called upon me to speak on his behalf and help restore credibility he lost amid the failure to find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq , " writes McClellan .
" So I stood at the White house briefing room podium in front of the glare of the klieg lights for the better part of two weeks and publicly exonerated two of the senior - most aides in the White House : Karl Rove and Scooter Libby . "
But his press performances were n't based on the facts , McClellan continues .
" There was one problem .
It was not true , " he writes .
" I had unknowingly passed along false information .
And five of the highest ranking officials in the administration were involved in my doing so : Rove , Libby , the vice President , the President 's chief of staff , and the president himself . "
McClellan conducted a number of often - heated press events centering on Plame .
In one September 2003 briefing , he expressly denied Rove 's involvement in the matter .
" I 've made it very clear , from the beginning , that it is totally ridiculous , " said McClellan at the time .
" I 've known Karl for a long time , and I did n't even need to go ask Karl , because I know the kind of person that he is , and he is someone that is committed to the highest standards of conduct . "
Later , in an October 10 press conference the same year , McClellan said that Rove , Vice President Dick Cheney 's former chief of staff Scooter Libby , and another senior administration staffer had all denied being connected to the leaking of Plame 's name .
" I spoke with those individuals , as I pointed out , " said McClellan , " and those individuals assured me they were not involved in this .
And that 's where it stands .
The new book also touches on other key Bush events and policy decisions , including the war in Iraq and the handling of Hurricane Katrina .
" With unprecedented candor , one of George W. Bush 's closest aides takes readers behind the scenes of the Bush presidency , and what exactly happened to take it off course , " states a publicity blurb .
" He gives readers a candid look into who George W. Bush is and what he believes , and into the personalities , strengths , and liabilities of his top aides .
Finally , McClellan looks to the future , exploring the lessons this presidency offers the American people as we prepare to elect a new leader . "

Victim Sarah Kreager Photo via The Examiner .
If the races had been reversed in this monstrous crime , Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton would already have booked their private planes on the first flight out to Baltimore .
Via The Examiner :
As Sarah Kreager , 26 , tried to sit down on a Baltimore City bus Tuesday , police say , a middle - schooler told her she could n’t .
When she attempted to take another seat , a middle - schooler would n’t let her .
Finally , according to police , Kreager just sat down .
She was “ immediately attacked ” by nine students — three females and six males — from Robert Poole Middle School .
They punched and kicked her at 2:59 p.m. at the intersection of 33rd Street and Chestnut Avenue , according to Maryland Transit Administration police .
Kreager was dragged off the bus and her boyfriend , Troy Ennis , attempted to get her back on , police said .
She sustained “ serious injuries ” and had to be transported to the University of Maryland Shock Trauma Center , according to a police report .

Kreager suffered two broken bones in her left eye socket , police said .
“ She had eye muscles that were damaged , ” a police report states .
“ She had deep lacerations on the top of her head and another above her neck . ”
Two seats and the bus ’ rear glass were destroyed during the attack , police said .
The bus driver on the No. 27 line quickly called police , who responded and arrested the nine juveniles , said Jawauna Greene , an MTA police spokeswoman .
All nine suspects , ages 14 and 15 , were arrested and charged with aggravated assault …
… The suspects in the incident are black .
The victim is white , according to the police report .

The court , however , agreed with the premise that the public 's right to know was greater than that of personal security .
The world 's favourite internet search engine , Google , has joined the corporate super - league with a market value which ranks among America 's top five companies .
Just a decade after its creation in a Stanford University dormitory , the Silicon Valley firm 's capitalisation reached $ 219bn on Tuesday - overtaking healthcare titan Proctor & Gamble to place it fifth on the US stockmarket .
Only ExxonMobil , General Electric , Microsoft and the telecoms company AT&T are larger than Google .
Its shares powered past yet another milestone today as they touched $ 700 for the first time , less than a month after reaching the $ 600 mark .
By mid-morning in New York , they were up $ 5.27 to $ 700.04 .
Google 's growth spurt has been driven by seemingly unstoppable profits - the company 's recent third - quarter earnings showed a 46 % leap in net income to $ 1.07 bn .
Experts cite its leadership in online maps , videos , news and finance - all of which are considered so far " under - monetised " but are thought to offer huge potential for advertising - driven revenue .
Todd Greenwald , an analyst at Nollenberger Capital in San Francisco , said : " Could they be bigger ?
Certainly .
Frankly , the market 's only just realising the vast amount of earnings power and is valuing Google appropriately . "
The soaring share price means Google 's two 34 - year - old founders - Sergey Brin and Larry Page - have paper fortunes of more than $ 20 bn each .
The pair only take salaries of $ 1 a year but receive more than $ 1 m in annual bonuses .
They have shown a taste for jetset living - they have refurbished a former Qantas Airways 180 - passenger Boeing 767 as a " party plane " with twin staterooms , a dining room and showers and have won permission to keep it at a usually restricted Nasa base in California .
Google is 10 times as valuable as America 's biggest carmaker , General Motors , and is worth 30 % more than the world 's largest drugs firm , Pfizer .
Long established " old economy " brands pale into comparison - Coca - Cola 's capitalisation is just $ 142bn , while McDonald 's can only command a value of $ 70bn .
Most industry followers believe that the only way is up for Google .
The information service Bloomberg reported that out of 37 analysts tracking the company , 33 recommend buying the shares and the other four rate the stock as a " hold " .
Google accounts for 56 % of all searches on the internet according to the online research firm Comscore .
In Britain , Google is visited more than any other website with 28.6 million unique users in September - reaching 89 % of all UK internet users .
Long - term critics of Google question the company 's cost control - its payroll has grown rapidly to 16,000 - and point to litigation from broadcasters over alleged rampant copyright abuse at Google 's YouTube arm .
But Mark May , an internet analyst at Needham & Company , wrote in a recent note : " We continue to view Google as a core holding and believe the company 's strong brand loyalty , the business 's substantial free cashflow potential and the team 's track record of innovation will lead to further gains . "
Google is shortly expected to reveal plans for a mobile phone to take on hi-tech competitors such as Apple 's iPhone .
The Google - powered phone is intended to make it easier to access the company 's most popular features through a handset - including YouTube , maps and Gmail email .
Competitors have struggled to keep up .
Yahoo ! , which ranks second among internet searches , has lost ground and recently parted company with its chief executive amid criticism over its drifting strategy .
The Web is Ruined and I Ruined it

The Web Is Ruined
and I ruined it
David Siegel
Every so often , dredging through the muck and mire of hopeless self - promotion and autodidacticism saturating the World Wide Web , one encounters an exotic specimen : the Web Head who truly merits it .
David Siegel is not merely a self - proclaimed " HTML Terrorist , " he has been so anointed by knowledgeable and right - thinking SGML / XML purists everywhere .
This article first appeared in Web Review in the depths of the Tag Wars .
It describes how proper separation of structure ( HTML ) , style ( CSS ) , and semantics ( XML ) make content more compelling and design more effective .
Visit David 's sites at http://www.verso.com and http://www.dsiegel.com. [ Ed ]
The Roots of HTML Terrorism
Some people say I 've ruined the Web , and to them it 's true .
Web pages can't be seen as easily by search engines and those with low - end machines have a hard time getting much out of my site .
On my personal site , I do n't even put ALT tags just to send a message to those surfing without images .
My life is visual .
I love museums .
How would you like to visit the Louvre with images turned off ?
I ruined the Web by mixing chocolate and peanut butter so they could never become unmixed .
I committed the hangable offense of mixing structure with presentation , and in HTML and SGML circles , that 's a big no - no .
The reason the HTML purists never carried out their threats is not that they 're against violence , it 's that they know that if they kill me , someone else will rise to take my place .
It seems that structure and presentation have been mixed forever , and the Web is in the fast lane of the road to Hell .
Fortunately , nothing on the Web is what it seems , and " forever " lasts only about six months .
Structure versus Layout
Layout is presentation .
Presentation is layout .
Apply one set of layout rules and get The New York Times .
Apply another set and get The Village Voice .
Notice I am not talking about content !
I 'm talking about layout .
I 'm writing this document in Microsoft Word .
To tell you that The New York Times is a newspaper title , I 've used the italic feature , as any good editor would .
Now that you 're reading it in HTML , someone has put it between < I > and </ I > tags , so now you 're seeing the title in italics , too .
Blasphemy !
How dare we use italics , when we mean < newspapertitle >
The New York Times </ newspapertitle > , do n't we ?
If we had a < newspapertitle > tag , then people with 24x80 terminals in Zimbabwe would see " The New York Times " rather than The New York Times , because on a 24x80 terminal , you can't display italics .
The browser itself adds the quote marks -- they would not be part of the document .
In this case , the tag indicates meta-information , which the User Agent ( also known as a browser ) interprets however it can on the target display .
Similarly , if this text were being spoken by a speaking browser for the blind ( yes , there are some -- and no , they 're not very good ) , the < newspapertitle > tag would be a signal to the program to pause and then emphasize the name of the paper .
Gripping , is n't it ?
Are they that extreme , those HTML extremists er , I mean , purists ?
Let 's take another example .
A few sentences earlier , I wrote " they would not be part of the document " in italics .
Remember that ?
Did I mean italics ?
Or did I really mean emphasis ! [ italics mine ]
Oh , yeah , that 's what I meant , but I 'm used to hitting the < I > key , not the < EM > key .
Wow .
Are they that extreme , those HTML extremists er , I mean , purists ?
Yes , they are that extreme .
They can't believe everyone is using < I > for italics when they really mean < EM > , for emphasis .
The Roots of HTML
Let 's look at the sheer beauty of this argument for a second .
Separate all your content from its descriptive data ( metadata , or markup ) , and the world suddenly gets interesting .
You can see right through newspapers to the stock pages .
You can compare movie reviews among 372 newspapers at once .
You can search for Marx and find Karl , not Groucho , simply by filtering for the < PROMINENTSOCIALIST CLASS=MANIFESTOWRITER > tag .
In a perfectly tagged world , no one needs a search engine at her own site .
In a perfectly tagged world , the big search engines do all the work for us , by searching the Web and storing not only the data , but also the metadata .
In a perfectly tagged world , we would standardize our tags , so that everyone would use the same exact tag to denote a < MOVIEREVIEW CLASS= HORROR > , or < RECIPE CLASS=VEGAN >.
If one person decided to use a tag called < MOVIEREVIEW > and another used one called < FILMREVIEW > , the search engines would have a hard time keeping up with all the new tags ( are you listening , Marc Andreessen ? ) .
Hence , the need for standardized markup ( there I go again - - do n't look at my source , okay ? ) .
Go one step further and say what kind of a document you are reading -- a play , a newspaper , a Ph.D. thesis , a recipe book , a journal -- and you soon need to generalize the language to include the document type , followed by the appropriate markup for that document type .
Cookbooks contain recipes , report cards contain grades , plays contain dialogue , scene and action descriptions , and so forth .
Standard tags for time sensitivity let visitors choose whether they want to see only the most recent content or see the last ten days ' worth of material with every page they visit .
Voilà !
I 've just performed a magic trick :
Now we know what SGML is -- Standard Generalized Markup Language .
It 's a difficult concept , because the generalized part adds a layer of abstraction by first saying what species of document you have , then adds the markup appropriate for that species .
Now that you understand it , you see where HTML came from .
HTML is a fairly weak , underpowered set of markup tags for marking up hypertext physics papers .
When Tim Berners - Lee talks about " inventing " the Web , he means that he came up with a few tags for writing physics papers and linking them together .
The Roots of HTML Terrorism
Just after Tim did his thing , a kid named Marc Andreessen came up with the idea of the < IMG > tag , and the Web was both born and destroyed at that moment .
You see , Marc is the founding father of the HTML Terrorist Guild , which now numbers in the thousands .
As inventor of the < BLINK > tag , Marc has done as much damage as I have with less effort .
All I did was take Marc 's < IMG > tag a step further , to use single - pixel GIFs to help lay out a Web page .
Seen from the perspectives of the SGML crowd , this is about as far away from the beauty of the original argument as one can get .
But it did n't stop there .
I kept wanting to align my backgrounds and foregrounds , forcing readers to see pages my way , not the way they thought they wanted to see them .
Now let 's return to the real world of the Web ( not an oxymoron at all , in case the thought just crossed your mind ) .
The Web got where it is in six easy steps :
The Framers of the Web mark up their papers on their NeXT machines and put them on the first Web servers , delighted to be avoiding FedEx charges to their limited particle - physics budgets .
The < IMG > tag makes the Web visual , and products like PageMill reinforce the ugly - factor of first - generation sites .
I come along and start laying out pages visually , using HTML ( admittedly , a markup language , not a page - description language ) as it was never intended to be used .
I pour narrative text into tables , completely hosing the idea that tables should be used for tabular material .
My sites become popular .
People start doing what I 'm doing .
I write a book explaining how to do it , and it becomes the Amazon.com number one best - selling book of 1996 in five months .
The Web falls apart quickly .
The search engines can't tell a picture of Dolly Parton from a picture of Dolly the sheep .
HTML changes so rapidly , and site maintenance becomes so difficult , that large sites start using databases to serve up their pages , separating the content from the HTML .
Dynamic
Web sites that cost $ 300,000 to build become the norm .
Companies like Organic grow quickly , taking advantage of the market for database - driven sites .
The search engines , which can't see inside databases , break even more .
Microsoft comes to the aid of the W3C and puts some muscle behind Cascading Style Sheets ( CSS ) , for the sole reason that they are what Netscape is not doing .
Also , as it turns out , the people in Microsoft 's browser division saw that it was good to separate style from markup , and they made a good choice .
Internet Explorer 3.0 ships with style - sheet capability .
Few people write style sheets , but they are a good step forward .
NetObjects Fusion , a product based entirely on my principles ( you can see my filenames in their code and I did n't get any NetObjects stock -- what is it they say about imitation and flattery ? ) .
The product takes a baby step toward becoming the first PageMaker of the Web .
Databases detect which browser you 're using and serve sites adjusted for all the different display bugs .
Structurists see Fusion sites being paired with databases and prepare to eat the sleepy applesauce and lay down with purple shrouds over their heads .
Style sheets do n't solve all layout problems , but they improve typography greatly .
Netscape announces a whole bunch of new tags to keep people smoking their layout crack .
Because Microsoft has aligned with the W3C , Netscape tries to reinvent Director by putting lots of " dynamic HTML " tags into their 4.0 browser .
The design community is n't sure what to do .
Keep in mind that the purists are protecting some pretty fetid ground .
Most of the content on the Web is garbage , and most of my content turns to garbage after some reasonably short period of time .
Trying to find quality on the Web is like trying to find arable land in Antarctica .
The Web is a visual medium -- not to design is to design .
Personally , I 'd rather leave the design up to professional designers than programmers , but hey -- that 's me .
It 's easy to be proud of your Web site .
It 's another thing to have people say it was visually appealing and easy to find everything .
Back to Reality
Here in the spring of 1997 , I still have to use what works .
My clients want to win on the Web , so we employ the method used by more political strategists : Image .
We use great - looking sites and compelling experiences to create equity on the Web for our clients .
Example :
The coming bookstore wars .
Amazon.com will have a lot of competition .
All of them will have great selection , service , and advice on what to buy .
The battle will be fought on design and editorial content , plus extra services that make people feel special .
This has nothing to do with " information , " but everything to do with attracting and keeping customers .
How much information does
Nike give out about its products ?
Not a lot .
On the commercial side of the Web , design can make millions of dollars of difference .
Does that mean Amazon.com should use every new gizmo and tag Netscape provides ?
Does that mean we should suck up to the smarmy < LAYER > tag and leave the standards body behind ?
I hope not .
I support the standards process .
Right now , there is an interesting debate in the W3C over something called the OBJECT model .
It promises to give us active , dynamic Web sites and still separate content from presentation .
For some odd reason , Netscape is actually being quite helpful and conciliatory in this debate , and though we can't figure out why , we certainly see it as a good sign for designers .
I can't say that much about the OBJECT model yet , because there are a bunch of details to work out .
Suffice to say it wo n't involve any new tags , because tags are for markup , not layout .
It will involve the use of a special tag , called < DIV > , which we already use today in our work with style sheets .
( View the source of http://www.highfive.com to see our current use of style sheets . )
We expect both fifth - generation browsers to incorporate the still - unapproved OBJECT model within a year .
We are waiting for PNG , the Portable Network Graphics format , to replace GIF .
Let 's hope that by the end of the year most images on the Web are PNG , with several levels of transparency and a much richer set of extensions .
It 's been a political battle , but PNG is promising and it will come .
Add PNG images to your sites -- visitors using Netscape Communicator will automatically download the PNG plug - in the first time they encounter one .
Let 's hope they encounter lots of them .
Perhaps professional - quality image standards like LivePicture and Olivr will take us even further in our quest for low - bandwidth quality .
We are waiting for vector graphics like Flash .
Flash images will be tiny .
They will look great .
They will be as close as you can get to PostScript without making a PDF .
We are waiting for something in between SGML and HTML .
SGML is too general and too complicated for the Web .
Instead , we need a junior version , and that 's called XML .
Just formulated in the fall of 1996 , the ideas behind XML are good : to create a generalized markup language independent of presentation that works for most of the document types found on the Web .
I 'll talk about XML another time , but the early news is that Microsoft is interested and excited about taking HTML in this direction .
In a few years , Microsoft Word 's underlying data could be marked up in XML , but it 's a bit far off to be making predictions like that ( I just ca n't resist trying to tilt the playing field ) .
We will have to wait before the tools catch up .
About two years ago , I said the first halfway decent tools would appear in late 1997 .
I may get lucky and be on track with that prediction .
Then again , we may have to wait a while longer .
HTML is n't PostScript .
It 's hard to build tools that do n't suck on top of a set of standards being used in a giant tug - of - war between big companies with millions at stake .
Until good tools exist , Web designers will continue to be used as human shields in the browser wars , with our customers being the big losers as they pay us to make two separate versions of everything and serve HTML out of custom databases .
Style Sheets : The Light at the End
of the Tunnel
Let 's take one thing at a time .
If we 're going to learn anything , it 's that style sheets are the future and tag - based layout is the past .
What can style sheets do ?
They can do a lot of typographic things , like set your margins , indents , drop caps , leading , and other niceties invented in the time of the Romans .
No longer should we pour our text into tables , for I have led us through the desert for 40 years ( seemed like it , anyway ) , and we have emerged in the promised land , where style sheets give us the margins we seek .
Sure , we still have to use tables to lay out our pages , but in a year or so , we hope to give that up , too .
Say goodbye to the single - pixel GIF !
Use it only when necessary !
Ban the kluges -- learn to use style sheets today !
Okay , maybe tomorrow .
Turns out that the Internet Explorer 3.0 version of style sheets is pretty different from the 4.0 version , and the Netscape Communicator version will likely have its differences .
We will find the common presentational behavior of both 4.0 browsers and use that .
Stay tuned .
One thing you do n't want to do is to commit style - sheet terrorism .
Style - sheet terrorism is where you use style - sheet capabilities by brute force , mixing the style primitives right into your content , rather than separating the content from the description of the presentation .
Look at Microsoft 's Style Gallery .
It 's shameful .
Look at both the code and with Netscape Navigator 3.0 .
What 's going on ?
To get a drop - shadowed " 3 , " they 've used the actual number two times -- once dark and once light -- positioned on top of each other .
Not only that , but the number itself is part of an ordered list -- the program should take care of the numbering automatically !
The style sheet should describe the behavior of an ordered list in the absence of the list data .
I repeat :
There should be no use of style sheets to effect typography that is bound to the content .
Style sheets must describe content that is n't there , then be applied to content that is .
If the style sheet does n't give the intended result , debug the style sheet , not the data .
To be fair , the gallery was created last summer in a rush .
The people hired to make it were just playing around .
But they did n't understand the basic concept , and Microsoft let everyone see it as an example of how to use style sheets , mostly because it looks awful in Netscape .
If you did it correctly , your pages would just look gray and dull in Netscape , rather than all screwed up , and that would reflect badly on Microsoft , hence the style - sheet terrorism .
The Big - Brother Issue
One of the central questions surrounding the use of style sheets is :
Who gets the final say over the look of a document ?
A small percentage of the readership is colorblind , another group prefers larger type , and others have special viewing requirements .
Then there are alternative surfing environments like Web phones , WebTV , and Web dishwashers .
Each has its own special browser and its own limitations .
Aside from that , issues of available typefaces , available colors , monitor size , and other parameters affect the average surfer every day .
Should there only be one way to view a Web page ?
My answer is simple :
The designer should be able to specify how the page looks under most conditions and give more ( but perhaps not total ) control to the viewer as a last resort .
In other words , designers should be authoritarian , not dictatorial .
Fortunately , that is roughly how style sheets work .
Style sheets can cascade , and that has two meanings , so let me take them one at a time .
Style sheets can refer by name .
A style sheet can include another style sheet simply by naming it , specifying its absolute or relative location on the Web .
This lets us build a hierarchy of simple , middle , and more complex style sheets without reinventing the wheel every time we write one .
As with Java , the lower - level libraries are just now being built ( by no one , actually , but we hope someone starts working on them soon ) .
Then we can write more complicated style sheets based on those and place them on public servers .
All you 'll have to do to use a Dave Siegel style sheet is include its name and location at the top of your file , and its full functionality will apply to your document .
Is that going to make using style sheets easy ?
Yes .
You wo n't have to write anything .
You 'll just find the style sheets you like and specify them by name .
Style sheets have the capability to degrade gracefully .
Today , you can specify which fonts to use for which sections of a site , and if those fonts are n't available , you can specify a second and third choice , and so on .
Style sheets go further .
If a style sheet is well written , it will contain instructions for what happens when you see a Web page under optimal conditions ( big screen , fast modem , lots of colors , etc. ) , then how it should look under suboptimal conditions ( 256 colors , 14 - inch screen , slow modem ) , and also how it should look under lousy conditions ( WebTV , Microsoft CE , black - and - white screen , etc. ) .
There are n't three levels of cascade , there are as many as the designer can specify .
One of the most vexing things about this approach is that we still do n't have standard ways of learning how big or colorful people 's systems are , and this is a huge impediment to site designers .
The W3C could have long ago specified ways for people to fill out a little profile in their browser , specifying , among other things , how many colors they have , how large their screen is , whether they have sound capability , etc .
There are a lot of other Big - Brother issues surrounding profiles , but I 'm a strong believer that people will benefit by giving sites a bit of information about themselves ( demographics ) , their lifestyles ( psychographics ) , and their viewing systems ( technographics ) .
If the Web is going to be free , it 's a small price to pay for getting better service .
And anyway , if you do n't specify a profile , you do n't get the benefit of it .
No one would be forced to fill out a profile , but if most people did , it would help sites degrade properly .
Finally , style sheets take the correct stance that the viewer should , in the end , be able to specify her own style sheet for her own viewing .
She should be able to set up her browser ( User Agent ) so it always overrides the designer 's style sheets and substitutes her own .
There should actually be levels of override .
It should be fairly hard to completely throw out a designer 's intended style sheet , but if she checks the box marked " Hey , I really really really want to use my own damn style sheet , okay ? " , then she should be able to get her way .
Turning in My Black Hat
Because both Marc Andreessen and I are HTML terrorists , we are jointly responsible for the mess .
Yet here our roads diverge .
While Marc and his pals have been slaving away deep in the Netscape laboratory to bring us such visions of beauty as the < SPACER > tag and the < MULTICOL > tag -- and now a new set of < LAYER > tags -- I am in the process of turning in my black hat .
I am leaning toward structure .
The hacks I 've espoused , especially the single - pixel GIF , and using frames and tables to do layout , are the duct tape of the Web .
They are the designer 's finger in the dam , trying to keep the ugly gray sites where they belong -- at Yahoo ! , not in our portfolios .
Several of the things I 've mentioned here are part of doing it better .
Some day , the purists and I will see eye - to - eye , while Marc and company keep on tagging , with lame excuses like : " Our customers demand interim , tag - based solutions . "
Hogwash .
When the browser manufacturers let us separate content from presentation , we will gladly comply , for the benefit of surfers everywhere .
My personal priorities are that design drives the train , because to hold an audience , you need good content presented well .
The best content poorly presented will lose to a better idea hidden by dull presentation ( presidential elections aside ) .
" XML promises to be the Alexandria ( I wo n't say Xanadu ) of our digital desert dreams . "
It will let us build great libraries simply by building our own sites .
It will let the average person put together very sophisticated and powerful applications , simply by tagging everything properly so it fits into the larger schema of the Web .
Style sheets and the OBJECT model will provide the layout capabilities to make it look good .
Then , in that future , we will have databases only to do what databases do best : search for and compare 283 possible ways to get from San Francisco to Denver on July 3 for the lowest fare , find the best combination of 40,000 products for a particular visitor , or to do banking transactions .
In this future scenario , Web sites will be big , flat , and tagged full of standard - compliant meta - data descriptions .
Then the webmaster will tend , or farm , this flat Web site , using automated content - management tools to help keep it all up to date .
Meanwhile , the search engines will grow more powerful every day and the average site builder will be able to participate .
Radical , yes .
You decide who is extreme .

Magnetic anomalies are caused by differences in the magnetisation of the rocks in the Earth 's crust .
Many years of negotiation were required to obtain confidential data from governments and institutes .
Scientists hope to use the map to learn more about the geological composition of our planet .
One should not underestimate the diplomatic efforts needed to secure support and data contributions from these organisations
Dr Michael Purucker , Nasa
The magnetic signature of the Earth 's crust has been measured for many decades by a multitude of groups ; but now , for the first time , the data has been combined to give a truly worldwide view of the phenomenon .
A British company involved in the project is GETECH , a spin - off from Leeds University .

Managing Director Dr J Derek Fairhead explains : " The project is the result of a lot of coordinating efforts by the IAGA ( International Association of Geomagnetism and Aeronomy ) organisation to put together a magnetic map of the world , and it 's taken decades to get to this position .
The Kursk Magnetic Anomaly has been exploited for iron ores

" But the regional nature of the magnetic field can be clearly imaged and put together with all the other data to generate a global image of the magnetics . "
Dr Juha Korhonen , one of the lead researchers on the project from the Geological Survey of Finland , explained that the map was available at " a low resolution " .

" There are just a few major deposits that can be seen on this map , like the Kursk iron ore deposit .
Mainly one can see the major geological formations .
" It 's generally considered in prospecting and resource analysis that this magnetic anomaly field is one of the most valuable tools or regional assets . "
Many causes
The global map shows the variation in strength of the magnetic field after the Earth 's dipole field has been removed ( Earth 's dipole field varies from 35,000 nanoTesla ( nT ) at the Equator to 70,000 nT at the poles ) .
After removal of the dipole field , the remaining variations in the field ( few hundreds of nT ) are due to changes in the magnetic properties of the crustal rocks .
Hot colours ( reds ) indicate high values ; cold colours ( blues ) indicate low or negative values .
The map shows up how the sea floor spreads apart in mid-ocean

The information can be viewed as a flat , two - dimensional map or rendered in 3D on a virtual globe .
There are several different causes of magnetic anomalies in the Earth 's crust .
On the ocean sea bed , the map shows a striped effect .
Where Earth 's tectonic plates are moving apart , new crust is created at mid-ocean ridges .
As the new material spreads out and cools , minerals in the rocks that make up the crust are magnetised in the direction of the Earth 's magnetic field at the time of their formation .
This field reverses polarity over time , creating alternating stripes on either side of the ridge .
A different perspective on the material under our feet
The old cratons , stable interior sections of the continental crust , are thicker and have high magnetic mineral content .
Perhaps the most prominent feature is the Kursk anomaly , which can be seen at the border between young western Europe and the old " Baltic Shield " .
First identified in the late 18th Century , the anomalous region became the focus of a major industrial effort by the Soviets to develop iron ore mines .
Pieces in a jigsaw
The international team had many difficulties to overcome in creating its map .
Dr Korhonen said : " To acquire the Russian data required a ministry decision there .
Then India released their data .
We have Argentine data , similarly , which has been closed to all the world . "
Dr Michael Purucker from the US space agency ( Nasa ) , a user of the map , said : " There are literally hundreds , perhaps thousands , of organisations around the world which hold this kind of data .
One should not underestimate the diplomatic efforts needed to secure support and data contributions from these organisations . "
One of the challenges in gathering data from many different sources is piecing it together , and ensuring that all the data sets are in the same format .
" There are different techniques , " explained Dr Korhonen .
" If the techniques are somewhat similar , it 's fairly easy finally doing the calculations in a similar fashion to put the map together .
" If the anomaly is defined in some other way , then we might have [ a ] problem .
That 's the main reason that the long wavelengths have been removed from the ground - based data and replaced by satellite data . "
Next steps
This magnetic data has been gathered by Champ , a German and Russian - built satellite that has been in orbit since 2001 .
Now coming to the end of its life , it has charted the entire globe .
Swarm is a future mission of the European Space Agency
With the publication of the first edition of the map , the team is already planning the second edition .
One area it hopes to improve on is the marine data coverage .
The first edition uses information from the US National Geophysical Data Center , but there are other sources that may help to improve the accuracy of the map .
The upcoming Swarm magnetic field satellites , to be flown by the European Space Agency ( Esa ) , will also help build new detail into the map .

" Instead our country needs to reopen its official investigation that it shut down in 1969 , " Symington said .
" We believe that for reasons of both national security and flight safety , every country should make an effort to identify any object in its airspace , " said a statement from the 19 former pilots and government officials from around the world .
The subject of UFOs came up in a recent debate among US presidential candidates , with Democrat Dennis Kucinich saying he once saw a UFO - making him the object of ridicule and jokes by late night television comedians .
Sceptics say UFO sightings are merely aircraft , satellites or meteors re-entering the Earth 's atmosphere .
But the retired pilots spoke to a sympathetic audience of UFO " believers " who heard them recall their encounters with seemingly other - worldly objects appearing out of the sky .
" Nothing in my training prepared me for what we were witnessing , " said James Penniston , a retired US Air Force pilot , as he described seeing and touching a UFO when he was stationed at a British air base in Woodbridge .
He said he saw an inexplicable triangular craft in a clearing in the woods with " blue and yellow lights swirling around the exterior " .
The UFO was " warm to the touch and felt like metal , " Penniston said .
One side of the craft had pictorial symbols and " the largest symbol was a triangle , which was centred in the middle of the others , " he said .
Then after 45 minutes the light from the object " began to intensify " and it then " shot off at an unbelievable speed " before 80 Air Force personnel , he said .
" In my logbook , I wrote ' speed : impossible ' . "
Rodrigo Bravo from Chile 's air force said UFOs needed to be studied but lamented that the media often belittle the sightings .
" Sadly the UFO subject has been contaminated with false information , out of touch with reality , provided by unqualified people to the media , " Bravo said .
" One of our most important civil aviation cases occurred in 1988 , showing that unidentified flying objects can be a danger for air operations , " he said .
" A Boeing 737 pilot on a final approach to the runway at the Puerto Montt airport suddenly encountered a large white light surrounded by green and red . "
The pilot took a sharp turn to avoid a collision , according to Bravo .
The panel included a former Iranian fighter pilot , Parviz Jafari , who said in 1976 he tried in vain to fire from his jet at an " object which was flashing with intense red , green , orange and blue light " over Tehran .
But when he approached , " my weapons jammed and my radio communications garbled " .
A former Air France captain , Jean - Charles Duboc , said in 1994 he and his crew saw " a huge flying disc " near Paris with a diameter of about 300 metres that left no sign on radar .
The disc " became transparent and disappeared in about 10 to 20 seconds , " Duboc said .
The former pilot said like other major airlines Air France was mindful of its image and it was difficult to raise the subject of UFOs .
A former official with the Federal Aviation Administration , John Callahan , said government agencies discourage inquiries into UFOs .
" ' Who believes in UFOs ? ' is the kind of attitude of the FAA all the time , " he said .
" However , when I asked the CIA person : ' What do you think it was , ' he responded ' a UFO ' . "
When Callahan suggested the government tell Americans about a UFO , the CIA official allegedly told him : " ' No way , if we were to tell the American public there are UFOs they would panic . " '

One route to a long and healthy life may be establishing the right balance in insulin signaling between the brain and the rest of the body , according to new research from Children ’s Hospital Boston .
The study , published in the July 20 issue of Science , not only reinforces the value of exercising and eating in moderation , but also helps explain a paradox in longevity research .
Insulin sends a vital signal throughout the body telling cells to use sugar from the blood .
But when cells become less sensitive to insulin , which often happens as we age and gain weight , the body must make more insulin to keep sugar under control and avoid type 2 diabetes .
For a long time , clinicians and scientists thought that “ more insulin was a good thing , ” says Morris White , PhD , a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator in Children ’s Division of Endocrinology , who led the new study .
“ But the increased insulin also gets into the brain , where it can be detrimental . ”
Studies in the worm C. elegans and in fruit flies show that reducing insulin signaling lengthens lifespan .
But in humans and rodents , reducing insulin signaling often causes diabetes .
The view that insulin could reduce lifespan is difficult to reconcile with decades of clinical practice and scientific investigation to treat diabetes .
White suspected that the key to explaining this paradox — and to maximizing both health and longevity — is to reduce insulin signaling only in the brain .
To test this idea , White ’s team measured longevity and other characteristics in several groups of mice .
In one group , they used a genetic trick to cut in half the amount of Irs2 , a protein that carries the insulin signal inside the cell , in every cell of the body .
Two other groups of mice were genetically engineered to have half , or nearly all , Irs2 removed only from the brain cells .
Another group of normal mice served as controls .
“ To our surprise , all of the engineered mice lived longer , ” says Akiko Taguchi , PhD , first author of the study .
Even more surprising , the mice lacking Irs2 only in the brain lived almost half a year longer than the normal mice – an 18 percent increase in lifespan – despite being overweight and having higher blood insulin levels , changes that usually reduce lifespan .
These long - lived mice were more active in old age , retained youthful metabolic cycles ( burning sugar by day and fat by night ) and retained protective levels of anti-oxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase , which protect against oxidative stress , or “ biological rusting , ” in the brain and body .
The mice with normal brain Irs2 levels aged less gracefully – they lost the metabolic rhythms of youth , became more sedentary , and had reduced anti-oxidant enzymes after meals , leaving them vulnerable to cellular damage .
Such damage correlates with a host of age - related diseases such as atherosclerosis , Alzheimer ’s disease and cancer , notes White .
White believes the study findings suggest a new approach to preventing diseases that shorten lifespan .
“ The engineered mice live longer because the diseases that kill them – cancer , cardiovascular disease and others – are being postponed by reducing insulin - like signaling in the brain , ” he says , “ regardless of how much insulin there is in the rest of the body . ”
Drugs that regulate Irs2 signaling in the brain ( but not elsewhere in the body ) are one possible preventive strategy , but no such drug has yet been found .
Targeted drugs will be important because Irs2 is needed in other tissues , particularly the pancreatic beta cells that produce insulin .
“ The easiest way to keep insulin levels low in the brain , ” White says , “ is old - fashioned diet and exercise . ”
Although obesity and sedentary lifestyles tune down the body ’s sensitivity to insulin , exercise can bring it back and reduce blood insulin levels .
Eating smaller meals keeps insulin low in the bloodstream , ensuring that less reaches the brain .
The new drugs designed to fight insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes might have a similar effect .
“ This study provides a new explanation of why it ’s good to exercise and not eat too much , ” says White .
“ It has less to do with how we look , and more to do with a healthy brain , especially in old age . ”
The study also calls into question the long - term effects of insulin therapy for diabetes , White adds .
“ High insulin should be the short term solution to insulin resistance , because it might damage the brain in the long run , ” he says .
Better treatments for diabetes and healthy aging , he suggests , should concentrate on sensitizing the body ’s cells to low amounts of insulin .

Speeding drivers are increasingly being given the chance to pay their dues by joining awareness classes .
After 20 years of driving without a blemish on her licence , Alison Trowsdale found herself back in the learner seat , among an unlikely collection of law breakers .
Trying to squeeze in the weekly shop at Tesco before having to do the school run is how this middle - aged mother got caught speeding .
It 's hardly the most dramatic of circumstances and , as breaking the law goes , it 's not going to place me at the top of any police force 's most - wanted list .
UK has most speed cameras in Europe But I accept even if the speedometer just nudges over the speed limit , you are in the wrong .
I was told I 'd been clocked doing 39 mph on a suburban road with a 30 mph limit , so it was a fair cop .
The first I knew of my crime was when a letter dropped onto my doormat inviting me to attend an " urban workshop " - as Thames Valley Police refer to their courses .
I did break the law , but I 'm not the kind of teenage speed freak who revs over the speed bumps at 50 mph in a built - up area or cuts up unsuspecting motorists on the inside lane of the motorway .
I know this is no excuse .
At 35 mph you are twice as likely to kill a child you hit as you are at 30 mph , according to road safety charity Brake .
It 's a stark statistic .
' Criminalising all drivers '
However , it still comes as a shock after driving for more than 20 years without a single point on my licence and only one very minor bump to my name .
But I am among a new , unsuspecting class of law breakers who are finding themselves in trouble with the police - often for the first time .
Speeding is now the most common offence on the UK 's roads , according to government figures .
In recent years it has made up more than one third of all driving offences dealt with by police in England and Wales .
SPEED AND IMPACT
At 40 mph 85 % of people hit by vehicles die At 30 mph 20 % of people hit by vehicles die At 20 mph 5 % of people hit by vehicles die SOURCE : DfT Part of the reason for this could be that the UK is the speed - camera capital of Europe , according to recent figures given to MPs .
Numbers have risen from 1,935 in 2000 to just over 5,500 this year .
Most police authorities now offer speed awareness courses as an alternative to points on your licence .
They are restricted to drivers who have exceeded the limit to a small degree .
Critics of the cameras , including MPs , say they are criminalising all drivers .
When I arrived at the Bicester training centre for my course , I have to admit I am faced with the most unlikely group of law breakers you can imagine .
The majority are slightly shocked middle - aged people like me .
At a guess at least six are pensioners , only one man is in a hoodie - but he 's far too old to qualify for a hug from David Cameron .
Indignant I find out I am one of 45,000 drivers to have attended driving courses in the Thames Valley region of Oxfordshire , Berkshire and Buckinghamshire .
If my group is anything to go by , most of those wo n't have fitted the stereotypical profile of your usual offender .
I was lucky to be offered the course , until April this year - when the scheme was extended - you were eligible only if you were driving up to five miles over the limit .
It costs £ 74 , but a speeding fine is £ 60 and points on my licence could result in increased car insurance .
I think this is what persuades most to sign up for the " urban workshops " .
For most of us it is the first time our driving abilities have been questioned since passing our driving test at 17
Not everyone is relieved like me to just avoid getting points .
Some of my fellow " offenders " are very indignant about finding themselves on the course .
They do n't consider themselves law breakers , even though the speed cameras have them down as such .
But we are not here to be judged or treated like hardened criminals , we 're told by our sharp - suited instructor Mark .
He 's not a police officer , which makes the course seem less formal .
Firstly our driving ability is put to the test using an interactive computer session .
Considering some older participants have n't even used a computer mouse before , I 'm not sure how much the programme reflects their driving skills .
Distracted Designed by Professor Frank McKenna , a leading expert in driver behaviour , the programme is all about getting drivers to reassess their own habits and understand that speed is to blame for 28 % of the 3,172 deaths on British roads last year .
For most of us it is the first time our driving abilities have been questioned since passing our driving test at 17 .
It judges how readily you recognise potential hazards on the road , what sort of distance you would leave behind the car in front and also asks what time of day you normally drive , how tired you are , whether other drivers make you cross .
Speed was blamed for 28 % of UK road deaths last year
It highlights my " slight tendency " to get distracted .
I 'm quite pleased with that considering the kind of distractions my daughters regularly create in the back of the car .
But apparently lack of attention is the most common reason for driving too fast .
Mark tells us speed is n't " a bad thing " , it just needs to be appropriate to the road .
Asked what the speed limits are on all types of roads , most of us knew the obvious ones but few of us knew all of them .
The same goes for different stopping distances .
It was quite a wake - up call .
Speed cameras do n't often get good press and Mark drew the session to a close by attempting a bit of PR spin .
Contrary to popular belief they are placed only at accident black spots and are nothing to do with generating extra revenue , he says .
Also , Thames Valley Police has 330 fixed speed cameras , of which only 22 are in action at any one time .
Police figures suggest one in 12 people who attends a speed awareness course is likely to be stopped again for speeding , whereas one in four drivers who collects the points is likely to reoffend .
So did it work for me ?
Two days later , driving along the same road where I was originally seen speeding , I spot a police officer waiting in a lay - by to catch unwitting motorists .
Only this time I 'm driving past at 30 mph .
Below is a selection of your comments .
If 28 % of accidents are caused by speeding what is being done to focus on the other 72 % ?
Fixing the 72 % would make a bigger impact , yet all we see is the use of the blunt instrument of speed cameras .
The " safety partnership " camera van in my home town parks within a few metres of a pelican crossing used by mothers taking their kids to school , partially obscuring the crossing for oncoming motorists .
In fact the zigzag lines in front of the Pelican have been shortened to allow this so that the van is not breaking the law of parking on a Pelican crossing !
Tim Banks , Knutsford I agree with the above comments .
A few 80 + neighbours have been caught and have points on their licence , while the " boy racers " get off scot - free .
Incidentally , my husband was offered a place on a local course , but he was in Intensive Care when his due date arrived ( some 3 months later ) .
We lost the course money and still had to pay the £ 60 and he got points on his licence .
Agnes Main , Rowlands Gill , Tyne & Wear I 'd like to see car manufacturers and the highways authorities work together to use technology to help reduce road deaths through speeding .
Speed limit signs could be fitted with short range transmitters which cars could pick and inform drivers of the current speed limit .
The system could even go as far as automatically limiting a cars top speed in urban areas .
David Waller , Bangor , UK I think that this is a fabulous idea .
I , too , have an unblemished driving record .
I like to think that I am a conscientious driver , but I know how very easy it is to slip over the limit by a few miles an hour .
If I was caught the idea of points on my license would not be a pleasant thought , and I know I would take this .
But more than that , just reading the article makes me think about how I need to be that little bit more aware of my speed on the road .
I am going to get there eventually , so it may as well be safely !
David Richardson , Leeds , West Yorkshire Living in the ' Traffic Light ' and ' Speed Camera ' capital of Europe , I find cameras can be dangerous in themselves .
I agree they are designed to stop the ' loons ' and therefore people like the lady in the story should be afforded some consideration .
We have ' Specs ' on a stretch of the M60 which reduces from 70 mph to 50 mph , just because of a ' bend ' in the road ...
This I think is taking it too far !!!
ken morton , stockport I wish I had been offered this choice .
Last month I was given three points for speeding on a 30 mph limit dual carriageway on my motorbike ; a fair cop , I was more than willing to admit .
However , two weeks later somebody pulled out in front of me when I was doing over 80 mph in a national speed limit ; regardless of whose fault it was , if I was sticking to the limit , I would not have crashed .
As it is , I have two broken ribs , one fractured hand , and one written off motorbike .
I can't help feeling that if the testing process or speeding penalty process focused on education , not punishment , people like me would understand the risk they are putting themselves and others in .
Ian Ferguson , Southampton , UK Your article mentioned ' speed being appropriate to the road ' and this is a problem :
Often the speed limits are not appropriate .
For example near me is a 3 mile stretch of 30 mph limit .
Only 1 mile of this is in a village , the rest is open countryside - inappropriate .
Another problem area is breaking distances - these have n't been reviewed since the 1960 when most cars had only drum brakes .
All experts agree that actual breaking distances are much less these days .
Martin Sweet , Swindon Motorists in the UK need to wake up to the issue of stopping distances .
All too often I 'm tailgated on de-restricted roads at 60 mph .
Its down right dangerous and the " slightly shocked middle - aged people " you refer to need to be told what a danger they are to people like me who try very hard to drive at the correct speed .
Being late for the school run or work does not give you the right to endanger other motorists .
Chris , Peterborough Mark tells us speed is n't " a bad thing " , it just needs to be appropriate to the road .
30 miles an hour is to fast outside a school past parked cars in the wet during the day time .
In the middle of the night on the same stretch of road but this time dry , no parked vehicles etc 40 mph is almost certainly safe .
The police can recognise this , cameras can not .
Many of the most dangerous , uninsured drivers are not traced and do not pay the fines ... not much of a deterrent for them to see a camera whereas I police car would be .
Michael Spears , St Albans
I 've always been amazed that you can pass your driving test at 17 and then never be tested again in your life .
I 'm the only person I know that has read the Highway Code since I passed my test in 1975 !
If drivers were tested every 5 years then the NHS bill would be reduced , the police and fire service bill would be reduced and thousands of examiners and teachers would be employed from the charges levied .
The bottom line is : the country would be a safer place .
Richard A Clifton , Wakefield
The indignant in your story are right , speeding fines , speed cameras and the whole message are the problem - they 're wrong .
Ask yourself the question , which would you rather have : - an alert driver taking notice of the conditions and driving appropriately , at 40 mph , or - a driver travelling at 30 mph with their attention distracted by looking out for speed cameras , trying to read the 30 different signs telling them what to do , with screaming kids in the back ?
For all the simplistic ' speed kills ' message what actually kills is someone not being able to pay attention .
The alert driver at 40 mph is much more likely to avoid hitting the child at all , or to have braked to 20 mph than the distracted driver at 30 mph .
We need to do away with the fault message and the whole " this speed is safe " mentality .
Its counterproductive .
We need to actively engineer the roads to minimise the distractions , give only the clear messages needed , and to prevent kids getting on the roads in the first place .
Speed does n't kill , bad driving and bad roads kill .
Ian Smith , London , UK I think you 'll find that most people caught speeding are the middle - class , big fast car demographic you found in the urban workshop .
Break the speed limit and you are breaking the law , which unsurprisingly makes you a law breaker whether you are a youthful hoodie or swan around in your great big Lexus .
And incidentally , I suspect the reason you have a blemish free license is more down to the fact that you just have n't been caught and not that you never speed !
Rachael , London I attempt to keep within the speed limit at all times , although it is hard to on motorways where the average speed of traffic is far in excess of the limit .
I find that Oxfordshire and now Buckinghamshire are increasingly putting up unwarranted lower speed limits that have no relationship to the road and this is encouraging drivers to break the law .
The B4009 north of Longwick in Bucks is a prime example of a 50 limit put on a clear , safe road with good visibility and minimal housing and can be ( and always was ) safe at 60 .
When I stick to these limits I rarely catch up with traffic but start to build up a ' tail ' behind me .
Grahame , Aylesbury
We 're all guilty of having done it in the past or present , and some of us have copped for it , however , Motorway traffic is already faster than 70 mph , this should in my opinion , be raised to 90 mph .
Cars are much safer these days , have better brakes and more safety features .
the biggest problem lies with so called " Boy Racers " who tear around and cause problems , I myself am a car enthusiast , and if I want to tear around in my old sports car , I pay for a Track Day .
get these Boy Racers to start paying fines for sitting in large shopping car parks and causing trouble or better yet , take away their cars and dismantle them !!!

Far from demonising speeding , cameras have done more to increase the social acceptability of breaking the law .
All too oftem I 've heard people warning others about where a camera is situated and how ' the stupid camera ' snapped them when they drove past .
It 's all about the camera , not what they were doing at the time .
If you are a visually aware driver always looking out for hazards then you should easily spot a speed camera well in advance of it .
If you get caught then you were either going so fast that slowing to a reasonable speed was impossible or you simply were n't paying attention enough .
I think dsuch drivers should be charged with paying undue care and attention instead .

Of course doing 30 mph is less dangerous than doing 40 mph .
So , let 's enforce the 30 mph limit .
But wait .
Doing 20 mph is even less dangerous , think of how many children will be saved .
So , 20 is plenty .
And why not abolish cars altogether : let 's just walk , think of how many innocent children we will save .
Of course we do n't do that , because we know ( even if it is not PC to say ) that the benefits of driving ( personal and to society in general ) FAR OUTWEIGH the cost of a few thousand road deaths a year .
That 's why almost all of us often speed .
Me , too .
I do about 50 mph ( like everyone else on that road ) on a safe 30 mph country road , every day as I drive to work and back .
It takes me 30 min instead of 50 .
That 's 40 min each day that I can spend in more productive ways , and I feel also less tired and more efficient at work .
Multiply that by millions of other " speeding " drivers over the UK , and you 'll understand how much our society benefits from the time gained by " speeding " .
Rob Barberis , Guildford
We are told that " speed cameras " are not for revenue raising , if this is correct then why do we not change to the Spanish system which simply puts a red stop light up when approached by a speeding vehicle in a restricted area , the light only changes to green when the vehicle is stationary .
This is a far better system but does not generate revenue so here in the U K we do not use them .
john hedley , manchester I was sent on a driver improvement programme by the Thames Valley force .
My driving has , I think , been much safer since .
I now adhere to the 30 limits but on my drive from my home to the railway station every morning , the queue of cars behind me lengthens as I move along .
Obviously the majority of road users are either oblivious or arrogant towards the rules of the road and until something happens to them , their thoughtless , sometimes selfish actions will go unpunished .

More from the author ► David Wilder is a spokesman for the Jewish community of Hevron .
He maintains a blog called " The Wilder Way " on Arutz - 7's Israel National News website .
During the early evening hours of March 19 , some eight months ago , Hebron 's Jewish community moved into a 35,000 sq. foot building , located on the main road between
Police investigations led to a positive conclusion : the purchase is 100 % kosher .
Police investigations led to a positive conclusion : the purchase is 100 % kosher .
Initial police investigations led to a positive conclusion : the purchase is 100 % kosher .
The IDF commander of the Hebron region had no objection to a Jewish presence in the house ; to the contrary , he regarded the site as a strategic asset and gave his blessings to the purchase .
However , members of the government , with then - Defense Minister Amir Peretz at the forefront , demanded a solution to the new " Jewish problem " in Hebron .
They did n't have long to wait .
A recently invented military order , never before implemented , was pulled off the shelves : " An order against bothering usage . "
Hearings , based on this strange , draconian military order , began before a military appeals panel of three judges .
Twenty - nine days after the Hebron community claimed the building , a Hebron Arab named Rajbi issued a claim in the Israeli Supreme Court , saying that the building belonged to him and that he had not sold it to the Hebron Jewish community .
His claim was filed while he was being held in a Palestinian Authority jail in Jericho .
His lawyers claimed he was being held for his own protection .
The timing of the complaint must be noted .
Squatters can easily be evicted for up to thirty days following their occupancy of a building .
After that time period , eviction becomes much more complicated .
Rajbi demanded that the Jews be expelled using this " squatters eviction law . "
Concurrently , the police , who originally found the purchase documents to be in order , notified the court that they now had a suspicion that some of the documents were forged .
Supreme Court president Dorit Beinish ordered the police to conclude their investigation within 45 days and report back to the court .
( Justice Beinish , it should be noted , recently met with the American ambassador in Israel and discussed with him " the settlers and the settlements . " )
The police were unable to complete their investigation within 45 days ; they delayed their report to the court four times .
A week and a half ago the prosecutor 's office finally reported back to the Supreme Court :
The documents are all in order , yet Jews still cannot live there .
Why ?
The documents are all in order , yet Jews still cannot live there .
Why ?
Yesterday , during another hearing held by the military appeals panel , the judges demanded that the prosecutor explain their findings concerning eviction using the " squatters eviction law . "
She responded : " [ The ] position of the State is that the sale was kosher ( i.e. , legitimate ) . "
Yet , several hours later , Hebron 's attorney received an eviction notice stating that the building would be evacuated within 48 hours based on the " squatters eviction law " , during which time the decision could be appealed .
In other words , the sale of the building was legitimate , the documents are all in order , yet Jews still cannot live there .
Why ?
Quite simply : Annapolitics .
Annapolitics has nothing to do with justice , fairness , objectivity or basic human rights .
According to various high - level sources , Israel , pre-Annapolis , promised the Arabs and George Bush that the Jewish residents of Beit HaShalom would be expelled from the building in the very near future .
The fact that the purchase was legal is irrelevant .
The only factor that matters is appeasement : appeasing our enemies on both sides of the line - the Americans and the Arabs .
Make no mistake .
The Americans are enemies .
Under the leadership of Condoleezza Rice and Bush ( in that order ) , the United States has been transformed into one of Israel 's most dangerous foes .
The policies being forced down our throats , including abandonment of virtually all of Judea and Samaria , as well as Jerusalem , is only the beginning .
The Golan Heights are not far behind .
Why ?
It is likely that Rice and Bush are placing their historical - legacy hopes on a miraculous Middle East peace accord .
However , there 's another reason .
This is the price America is demanding of Israel to take care of the Iranian nuclear threat .
But for Israel , this is like asking :
Which do you prefer , to be murdered or assisted suicide ?
The linchpin of this entire absurdity is Abu Mazen .
The linchpin of this entire absurdity is Abu Mazen .
Israel 's leaders are n't overly righteous either .
There is Ehud " the results of 1967 will be changed significantly " Olmert and Foreign Minister Tzipi " it 's no longer Arab against Jew , rather moderate against extremist " Livni .
These words leave little doubt as to the direction they are taking and how we , the residents of Judea and Samaria , will be defined ( in one breath with Hamas and Hizbullah ) .
What can we pray for ?
Also very simple .
The linchpin of this entire absurdity is Abu Mazen - Mahmoud Abbas , " President " of the Palestinian Authority .
If Olmert goes , Tzipi , Ehud Barak and Binyamin Netanyahu are waiting in the wings .
Bibi's reaction to Annapolis was n't one of horror , rather one that said we conceded too much without getting anything in return .
And when Bush concludes his presidency , who knows who will replace him .
Unfortunately , there is not much in the way of information ( or pictures for that matter ) of the Tardis bedroom that Steve Baker of Sittingbourne , Kent , built for his 10 - year - old son George , but the image included here should give you the gist .
Obviously the kid is a rabid Doctor
Who fan — an obsession that is only encouraged by the fact that everyone notices that he looks like a miniature David Tennant .
Watch your back David — George will probably be after your job one of these days .

There was a time when if you read one book by Peter Norton , you literally knew everything there was to know about programming the IBM - PC .
Over the last 20 years , programmers around the world have been hard at work building abstraction upon abstraction on top of the IBM - PC to make it easier to program and more powerful .
But the law of leaky abstractions means that even as they built the abstractions that are supposed to make programming easier , the sheer amount of stuff you have to know to be a great programmer is expanding all the time .
Becoming proficient , really proficient , in just one programming world takes years .
Sure , lots of bright teenagers learn Delphi one week and Python the next week and Perl the next week and think they are proficient .
Yet they do n’t have the foggiest clue how much they ’re missing .
I ’ve been working with ASP and VBScript since it first came out .
VBScript is the dinkiest language on earth and ASP programming consists of learning about 5 classes , only two of which you use very often .
And only now do I finally feel like I know the best way to architect an ASP / VBScript application .
I finally think I know where the best place to put database access code is , the best way to use ADO to get recordsets , the best way to separate HTML and code , etc .
And I finally use regexps instead of one - off string manipulation functions .
Only last week , I learned how to get COM objects out of memory so you can recompile them ( without restarting the whole web server ) .
Fog Creek is too small to have specialists , so when I needed to write a really good installer for FogBUGZ , our ASP / VBScript based product , I drew on several years of C++/MFC experience , and years of experience with Windows APIs , and good Corel PhotoPaint skills to create a neat picture in the corner of the wizard .
Then to get FogBUGZ to work perfectly with Unicode , I had to write a little ActiveX control using C++ and ATL , which drew upon years of C++ and COM experience and a week or so learning about character encodings when I implemented that code in CityDesk .
So when we had a weird NT 4.0 - only bug , it took me 3 minutes to debug , because I knew how to use VMWare , and I had a clean NT 4.0 machine set up in VMWare , and I knew how to do remote debugging with Visual C++ , and I knew to look in the EAX register to get the return value from a function .
Someone who was new to this all might have taken an hour or more to debug the same problem , but I already knew a tremendous amount of “ stuff ” that I ’ve been learning , basically , since 1982 when I got my first IBM - PC and that Norton book .
Leaky abstractions mean that we live with a hockey stick learning curve : you can learn 90 % of what you use day by day with a week of learning .
But the other 10 % might take you a couple of years catching up .
That ’s where the really experienced programmers will shine over the people who say “ whatever you want me to do , I can just pick up the book and learn how to do it . ”
If you ’re building a team , it ’s OK to have a lot of less experienced programmers cranking out big blocks of code using the abstract tools , but the team is not going to work if you do n’t have some really experienced members to do the really hard stuff .
There are a lot of programming worlds , each of which requires a tremendous amount of knowledge for real proficiency .
Here are the three I personally know best :
MFC/C++/ Windows
VBScript / ASP
Visual Basic
All , basically , what you would call Windows programming .
Yes , I ’ve written Unix code and Java code , but not very much .
My proficiency in Windows programming comes from knowing not just the basic technologies but also the whole supporting infrastructure .
So , I claim , I ’m really good at Windows programming because I also know COM , ATL , C++ , 80×86 Assembler , Windows APIs , IDispatch ( OLE Automation ) , HTML , the DOM , the Internet Explorer object model , Windows NT and Windows 95 internals , LAN Manager and NT networking , including security ( ACEs , ACLs , and all that stuff ) , SQL and SQL Server , Jet and Access , JavaScript , XML , and a few other cheerful facts about the square of the hypotenuse .
When I ca n’t get the StrConv function in VB to do what I want , I bang out an COM control so I can drop into C++ with ATL and call the MLang functions without dropping a beat .
It took me years to get to this point .
There are lots of other programming worlds .
There ’s the world of people developing for BEA Weblogic who know J2EE , Oracle , and all kinds of Java things that I do n’t even know enough about to enumerate .
There are hard core Macintosh developers who know CodeWarrior , MPW , Toolbox programming in System 6 through X , Cocoa , Carbon , and even nice obsolete things like OpenDoc that do n’t help any more .
Very few people , though , know more than one or two worlds , because there ’s just so much to learn that unless you have to work in one of these worlds for more than a couple of years , you do n’t really grok it all .
But learn you must .
People get kind of miffed when they go on job interviews and get rejected because , for example , they do n’t have Win32 ( or J2EE , or Mac programming , or whatever ) experience .
Or they get annoyed because idiot recruiters , who would not know an MSMQ if it bit them in the tailbone , call them up and ask if they “ have 5 years MSMQ . ”
Until you ’ve done Windows programming for a while , you may think that Win32 is just a library , like any other library , you ’ll read the book and learn it and call it when you need to .
You might think that basic programming , say , your expert C++ skills , are the 90 % and all the APIs are the 10 % fluff you can catch up on in a few weeks .
To these people I humbly suggest : times have changed .
The ratio has reversed .
Very few people get to work on low level C algorithms that just move bytes around any more .
Most of us spend all our time these days calling APIs , not moving bytes .
Someone who is a fantastic C++ coder with no API experience only knows about 10 % of what you use every day writing code that runs on an API .
When the economy is doing well , this does n’t matter .
You still get jobs , and employers pay the cost of your getting up to speed on the platform .
But when the economy is a mess and 600 people apply for every job opening , employers have the luxury of choosing programmers who are already experts at the platform in question .
Like programmers who can name four ways to FTP a file from Visual Basic code and the pros and cons of each .
The huge surface area of all these worlds of programming leads to pointless flame wars over whose world is better .
Here ’s a smug comment somebody anonymously made on my discussion board :
“ Just one more reason why I ’m glad to be living in the ‘ free world . ’
Free as in speech ( almost ) and freedom from pandering to things like setup programs and the registry – just to name a few . ”
I think this person was trying to say that in the Linux world they do n’t write setup programs .
Well , I hate to disappoint you , but you have something just as complicated : imake , make , config files , and all that stuff , and when you ’re done , you still distribute applications with a 20 KB INSTALL file full of witty instructions like “ You ’re going to need zlib ” ( what ’s that ? ) or “ This may take a while .
Go get some runts . ”
( Runts are a kind of candy , I think . )
And the registry — instead of one big organized hive of name / value pairs , you have a thousand different file formats , one per application , with . whateverrc and foo.conf files living all over the place .
And emacs wants you to learn how to program lisp if you ’re going to change settings , and each shell wants you to learn its personal dialect of shell script programming if you want to change settings , and on and on .
People who only know one world get really smarmy , and every time they hear about the complications in the other world , it makes them think that their world does n’t have complications .
But they do .
You ’ve just moved beyond them because you are proficient in them .
These worlds are just too big and complicated to compare any more .
Lord Palmerston : “ The Schleswig - Holstein question is so complicated , only three men in Europe have ever understood it .
One was Prince Albert , who is dead .
The second was a German professor who became mad .
I am the third and I have forgotten all about it . ”
The software worlds are so huge and complicated and multifaceted that when I see otherwise intelligent people writing blog entries saying something vacuous like “ Microsoft is bad at operating systems , ” frankly , they just look dumb .
Imagine trying to summarize millions of lines of code with hundreds of major feature areas created by thousands of programmers over a decade or two , where no one person can begin to understand even a large portion of it .
I ’m not even defending Microsoft , I ’m just saying that big handwavy generalizations made from a position of deep ignorance is one of the biggest wastes of time on the net today .
Frequent readers , by now , have noticed that I ’ve been thinking of the problem of how one might deliver an application on Linux , Macintosh , and Windows without paying disproportionately for the Linux and Macintosh versions .
For this you need some kind of cross -platform library .
Java attempted this but Sun did n’t grok GUIs well enough to deliver really slick native - feeling applications .
Like the space alien in Star Trek watching Earth through a telescope , they knew exactly what human food was supposed to look like but they did n’t realize it was supposed to taste like something .
Java apps have menus in the right places but there are all these keyboard things that do n’t work the same way as every other Windows app and their tabbed dialogs look a little scary .
And there is no way , no matter how hard you try , to make their menubars look exactly like Excel ’s menubars .
Why ?
Because Java does n’t give you a very good way to drop down to the native facilities whenever the abstraction fails .
When you ’re programming in AWT , you ca n’t figure out the HWND of a window , you ca n’t call the Microsoft APIs , and you certainly ca n’t intercept WM_PAINT and do it differently .
And Sun made it plenty clear that if you tried to do that , you were n’t Pure .
You were Polluted , and to hell with you .
After a number of highly publicized failures to build GUIs with Java ( e.g. Corel ’s Java Office suite and Netscape ’s Javagator ) , enough people know to stay away from this world .
Eclipse built their own windowing library from the ground up using native widgets just so they could write Java code that had a reasonably native look and feel .
The Mozilla engineers decided to address the cross platform problem with their own invention called XUL .
So far , I ’m impressed .
Mozilla finally got to the point where it tastes like real food .
Even my favorite bugaboo , Alt + Space N to minimize a window , works in Mozilla ; it took them long enough but they did it .
Mitch Kapor , who founded Lotus and created 123 , decided for his next application to go with something called wxWindows and wxPython for cross platform support .
Which is better , XUL , Eclipse ’s SWT , or wxWindows ?
I do n’t know .
They are all such huge worlds that I could n’t really evaluate them and tell .
It ’s not enough to read the tutorials .
You have to sweat and bleed with the thing for a year or two before you really know it ’s good enough or realize that no matter how hard you try you ca n’t make your UI taste like real food .
Unfortunately , for most projects , you have to decide on which world to use before you can write the first line of code , which is precisely the moment when you have the least information .
At a previous job we had to live with some pretty bad architecture because the first programmers used the project to teach themselves C++ and Windows programming at the same time .
Some of the oldest code was written without any comprehension of event - driven programming .
The core string class ( of course , we had our own string class ) was a textbook example of all the mistakes you could make in designing a C++ class .
Eventually we cleaned up and refactored a lot of that old code but it haunted us for a while .
So for now , my advice is this : do n’t start a new project without at least one architect with several years of solid experience in the language , classes , APIs , and platforms you ’re building on .
If you have a choice of platforms , use the one your team has the most skills with , even if it ’s not the trendiest or nominally the most productive .
And when you ’re designing abstractions or programming tools , go the extra mile to make them leak proof .
This week ’s Silly Sunday is on silly rules and customs in the office , another ranking survey from goo Ranking .
The fieldwork was conducted over the 24th and 25th of October 2007 , but no demographic information was given , nor was there a breakdown by sex , sadly .
At my workplace , I wish they ’d quit doing 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 9 , 11 , 12 , 15 , and 27 .
For those of you who have n’t worked in Japan , perhaps a few of these options need to be explained .
Number 6 and number 9 usually feature together ( we actually have lunchtime meetings at my workplace ) ; everyone gathers together , one person ( rotated every day ) reads the company precepts , then everyone repeats after him or her .
Next , the person whose turn it is tells a story perhaps related to work , perhaps not .
Other companies may also have pep talks from the boss .
Actually , I do think that morning meetings are to some degree useful ; ours are relatively painless , barring the company motto reading , of course , and the singing of the company song , which thankfully is not compulsory !
Number 12 is interesting – every Friday after lunch we have to vacuum the office and empty the rubbish bins .
I did once ask why we did that but all I got in reply was a blank state wondering why I would question such a thing .
Indeed , we even had a suggestion from someone as part of our company - wide stinginess initiative that we should also clean the corridors to save paying cleaners ’ wages , an idea demonstrating blissful unawareness of the hourly rate of a cleaner versus that of an engineer .
Oh , and you do n’t want to get me started on the complexity of my employer ’s internal systems …

The scheme that gave residents of Shoreditch links to local CCTV cameras through their TV sets had better viewing figures than Channel 4's Big Brother , according to an internal report by the local authority 's rejuvenation body .
The Register has learned how residents took to the Shoreditch Digital Bridge scheme in order to scan for and report anti-social behaviour .
Yet the over - arching aim of the project was to bridge the digital divide and improve take - up of online public services by giving TV - internet access to people in poor areas .
According to preliminary results of the Shoreditch pilot - due to be published in January - linking people 's living - room television sets to local CCTV cameras had attracted viewing figures with an " equivalent reach of prime time , week - day broadcast programming " .
Official stats showed that a higher percentage of people tuned in to look through their local CCTV cameras ( about 27 per cent of those with access ) than watched Channel4's hit snoop show , Big Brother ( about 24 per cent ) .
Atul Hatwal , project manager at the Shoreditch Trust , said the CCTV hook - up was the main reason why people wanted to get the Digital Bridge internet access through their televisions .
" In focus groups , the biggest thing they said to us was it made them safer , because if you are in a public space you know someone 's watching . "
The Information Commissioner had ordered the homesnoop CCTV be handicapped by low resolution to prevent the watchers from identifying the people they were watching .
" You could n't recognise specifics , but you could see if there was trouble happening or if someone was roaming about .
It made people feel safer , " said Hatwal .
Indeed , residents were bothered by the restriction and not at all worried what implications the scheme might have for civil liberties or community .
" Not a single resident came back and raised [ CCTV ] as an issue , " he said .
" It was the defining thing that made people say , ' Oh yes , I want that ' , and they wanted to see more detail [ in the CCTV images ] . "
Even more popular than the CCTV , however , was a fly on the wall documentary serial produced for the scheme .
Called Blues and Twos , it followed local Bobbies around on the beat and pulled in 37 per cent of viewers .
The internal report noted how these viewing figures were , comparatively , almost as good as Eastenders .
Digital Bridge also brought about a 600 per cent rise in reports of graffiti .
And a 200 per cent increase in reports of vandalism .
The report said : " Focus group feedback indicates the CCTV is helping address fear of crime and ... generating major new community vigilance resource . "
Though they may not have signed up for access to the wider internet , the scheme is reported to have got a " majority " of residents into the habit of using the internet on a daily basis .
The Shoreditch pilot was closed in June , but phase two of the scheme is being announced in January and the model is being promoted to councils nationwide . ®
' I just sat down and kept on reading .
I did n't get up until I had finished .
He captured that moment of time so well , ' said Thompson , professor of popular culture at Syracuse University .
Thompson was not alone .
Twenty years ago this month Tom Wolfe 's novel hit American bookstores and became both a literary sensation and a cultural landmark .
It was a tale of how a wrong turning in the Bronx plunged rich white banker Sherman McCoy into a maelstrom of racial strife and skulduggery .
It portrayed a city on the brink of collapse , with a white upper crust of bankers - the so - called Masters of the Universe - partying in penthouses as the rest of New York 's inhabitants , often black , struggled against a tidal wave of crime and unemployment and were exploited by a ruthless political class .
The book cemented a worldwide image of New York as mad , bad and dangerous .
Now , as the city marks two decades since Wolfe 's seminal tome first appeared , New Yorkers are living in a city that has changed beyond all recognition .
Instead of sinking into decay , New York has rebounded beyond all expectations .
A high - profile battle against crime has made it the safest large city in America .
A wave of gentrification has washed over a city where once notorious neighbourhoods such as Harlem and even the South Bronx ( now SoBro in estate agent slang ) are the hot property markets .
House prices have soared .
New shops and restaurants open every day .
Its streets are safe .
But the transformation has left many New Yorkers wondering what they have lost .
Wolfe chose New York because it said something about America .
Now many are wondering if the safer , cleaner , richer city has not also lost its role as the heartbeat of American culture .
Wolfe thinks so : his latest book tackling the modern American zeitgeist is set in Miami .
' New York , while it is flourishing , has become a less interesting place .
It is not where America is changing any more , ' said Brian Abel Regan , author of Tom Wolfe : A Critical Companion
The ' new ' New York is everywhere .
Photographer Maggie Wrigley sees it from her apartment in a far - flung part of the East Village .
She arrived in 1984 - as Wolfe was researching his book - and lived in a squat in an area riddled with drugs , gangs and penniless artists like herself .
Two decades later she is in the same apartment but the neighbourhood has completely changed .
Now the East Village is populated by young people fresh out of college and taking up jobs in the burgeoning financial sector .
Apartment rents have sky - rocketed , pushing out the poor , the working class and families .
Even the infamous Bowery - America 's original Skid Row - which bisects the Village is now lined with expensive clubs and cocktail bars .
The Bowery Hotel has just opened , offering rooms for $ 550 a night on a street once populated by flop - houses for the city 's down and outs .
' There is no place for those without money .
Everything is being eaten by the real estate market , ' Wrigley said .
Abandoned buildings that no one wanted decayed or became crack dens in the Eighties .
The real estate boom changed all that , creating a spiralling market that seems immune from the house price collapse in the rest of America .
The trend began downtown in warehouse areas such as SoHo and Tribeca , then spread north gentrifying the Village , then Chelsea , then Hell 's Kitchen and out of Manhattan into Brooklyn and beyond .
New York 's tourist board has opened a new office in Harlem .
It touts cultural tours , food tours and music tours .
It is a long way from The Bonfire of the Vanities where racial divisions and street crime would have made a tour of Harlem unthinkable .
' There is not that fear any more at all ' said Chris Heywood , of NYC & Company .
Racial divides are coming down .
In The Bonfire of the Vanities the character of the Reverend Bacon exploits the hit - and - run accident , fanning racial flames for political gain .
It was suspected to be inspired by the real - life figure of the Reverend Al Sharpton , based in Harlem , who was then a prominent activist .
Sharpton is still there but he is a marginal figure .
Last week his offices were raided on suspicion of tax evasion .
The main tabloid news story in New York last week was of a heroic young Muslim who came to the aid of a Jewish couple being beaten on the subway by white teenagers .
The murder rate is the lowest since 1963 .
It is now one a day , down from a high of six a day in 1990 .
Dubbed the ' Manhattan Murder Mystery ' by sociologists , no one is sure why it has fallen .
' New York was more artistic and more interesting back then .
But no one wanted to feel threatened , ' said Wrigley .
For those in search of ethnic diversity , the far northern reaches of Manhattan host a huge Hispanic population where Spanish is the language of the streets .
Chinatown has boomed .
In Queens , far from Manhattan 's main drags , more languages are spoken in a smaller area than practically anywhere else on earth .
The crime , poverty and racial problems that marked the Eighties are clearly not only a thing of the past .
Instead they have merely been pushed out of the city 's core .
In the outer boroughs they still persist , in the huge projects that dot Brooklyn and the Bronx and rarely get much attention from the mainstream media .
Shocking cases of police brutality still regularly occur .
This year alone has seen the case of Sean Bell , a black man shot dead by police on his stag night .
Bell had done nothing wrong but undercover cops mistook him for a drug dealer and he died in a hail of more than 50 bullets .
There was also the death of Kheil Coppin , a mentally ill young black teenager who brandished a hairbrush at police .
He was shot eight times .
Then there are the startling statistics over police stop - and - search tactics .
In 2006 police stopped half a million New Yorkers , 89 per cent of whom were non-white .
Fifty - five per cent of them were black , double the percentage of the black population .
Police also use force on black people 50 per cent more than on white people , despite the fact that police find guns , drugs or stolen property on white people twice as often as on black people .
The lack of street outrage in the 2000s compared with the Eighties does not always reflect a lack of racism ; it reflects a lack of power .
So the picture emerging two decades after Wolfe 's book is one he would both recognise and find strange - a New York that still thrives and still matters .
It is still a place where the very rich live in the same town as the very poor and where racial disputes linger , where grafters of all kinds wheel and deal in dirty politics and tabloid newspapers can inflame a story .
It is still a place where artists struggle and sometimes succeed .
' It is still the greatest city on earth , ' said Wrigley .
But it has become richer , safer , less individual and more suburban : more like the rest of America .
Daniel Czitrom sees that .
He was born in the Bronx and is now an expert on the city 's history at Mount Holyoke College .
He left in the early Eighties and has witnessed the transformation of the city from his old neighbourhood in the Bronx to the now leafy suburban feel of much of Manhattan 's formerly crime - ridden streets .
' It is a cliche but it is true .
The one thing that is constant about New York is that it is always changing .
It has always been that way , ' said Czitrom .
But there is an uneasy undercurrent to what has happened that would have amazed those reading The Bonfire of the Vanities in late 1987 .
The book captured much of the terror and fear of the white population .
They seemed about to flee .
Yet in reality , 20 years later , it is rich white people who took over .
With gentrification - spearheaded by the always booming banking industry - swaths of the city have become much wealthier , and also much paler .
Even Harlem is becoming a whiter neighbourhood .
That was never predicted in Bonfire
Sherman McCoy went from being a Master of the Universe to facing a trial for manslaughter , brought down by New York 's gritty system .
Yet his kind have prospered in the Big Apple .
Far from marking the beginning of the end of McCoy and his ilk in New York , the past 20 years have seen them take over the city .
The Real McCoy ...
First published in instalments in Rolling Stone magazine , Tom Wolfe heavily revised The Bonfire of the Vanities for book publication in December 1987 .
The plot centres on Sherman McCoy , a rich Wall Street ' Master of the Universe ' who lives in a luxury Manhattan apartment .
His life begins to collapse when he and his mistress , Maria Ruskin , take a wrong turn going home and end up in the Bronx .
Ruskin is driving when they hit a young black man .
The case of an unknown white driver running over a black student becomes a cause celebre for various factions of the city : a rule - bending civil rights activist , a sleazy British journalist out to rescue his career and a mayoral candidate after the black vote .
When McCoy is named in the press as the driver , he becomes the most hated man in New York , which hangs on the edge of violence .
His mistress flees the US , his wife leaves him and he ends up broke and facing manslaughter charges .
The book sold over three million copies and was made into a film with Tom Hanks as McCoy .
When the monks began marching in peaceful protest over a week ago , the junta remained ominously silent .
Then , on Tuesday , the crackdown began .
An unconfirmed number of monks were shot dead , monasteries were raided and hundreds of monks have been imprisoned .
How will the predominately Buddhist population of Burma respond to this attack on members of its revered religious order ?
With absolute horror , I imagine , as they have done to previous attacks ( an unverified number of monks were shot dead during the nationwide uprising in 1988 , and over 500 were imprisoned ) .
But people 's reactions will probably be expressed behind closed doors .
The regime has a terrifyingly effective network of spies and informers , and people are often not willing to openly voice any criticism of the regime for fear of imprisonment and torture .
The surveillance has been so insidious that there are Burmese people I have met who do not trust anyone outside their immediate family ; they wo n't talk openly to cousins or close friends .
When I asked a friend for advice on how to safely do research in Burma , he told me to operate under the assumption that everyone I met was an informer - including him .
After the events of 1988 , the regime began to eliminate all possible means of dissent within the country .
The student community , which had led and organised the demonstrations , was politically emasculated .
Through surveillance and intimidation , the regime managed to create a country in which there is no social or political space for people to gather or organise in big numbers .
Many Burma watchers , myself included , thought that protests of the kind which took place in 1988 could n't happen again as there is seemingly no way to gain a critical mass within such an oppressive environment .
And yet , over the past fortnight , the monks have risen up in numbers it would have been impossible to imagine just a few weeks ago .
They are being led by the Alliance of All Burmese Buddhist Monks , an organisation that must have been operating deeply underground as few people had ever heard of them before last week .
Many of my Burmese friends are unsurprised by surprising events such as this .
One friend always travels prepared for any eventuality ; he sits bolt upright throughout overnight train journeys with his belongings clasped in his lap , just in case .
When I ask his opinion on future events , he squints his eyes with theatrical aplomb and says , " In Burma , anything can happen . "
Somewhere within that " anything " is the possibility of a mutiny within the army .
For many soldiers , being ordered to shoot or beat up a monk goes against every grain of their spiritual up - bringing , and ensures they will carry the burden of bad karma for life - times to come .
And the lower - ranking soldiers share certain similarities with the rest of the population : they , too , are poor , badly treated and afraid .
I used to see soldiers living in the crumbling outbuildings of the old British Secretariat , the regime 's main ministerial building until it moved to its new capital .
In the centre of Rangoon , these poorly - paid soldiers had to use kerosene lamps and cook over camp - fires as if they were in the jungle .
One of the many rumours to emerge from Burma over the past couple days is that there may be a split in the army .
Troops from central Burma are said to be marching towards Rangoon .
Some say they are coming to challenge the soldiers who are attacking monks ; others say they are coming to reinforce them .
Whether these rumours are true or not , they are often accurate barometers of people 's hopes and fears :
Will they free us , or will they crush us ?
If the army succeeds in crushing this uprising - which , so far , it seems to be doing - then the regime will set to work purging the monastic order of what it likes to call " destructive elements " and even more monks will be imprisoned and tortured .
The regime 's intelligence agents will shave their heads and infiltrate the monasteries , praying among the monks as one of them .
What little space for political organisation once existed within the monkhood will be obliterated .
Yet another attempt by the people to speak out about their suffering will have been silenced .
So how will the Burmese people respond to soldiers aiming their guns at unarmed monks ?
How can they respond ?
If they are able to push aside a lifetime of oppression and fear , they can make martyrs of themselves and walk out into the street towards the guns .
And the monks could do the same - if they are still able to mass themselves - there is , after all , at least one monk for every soldier willing to shoot him .

Yaks on the track ; a hazard of the Everest Marathon course
Once that potential hazard is removed , another more awkward obstacle presents itself .
A herd of yaks is inching its way up the same narrow , uneven street in Namche Bazaar , the commercial capital of the Sherpa community in Nepal .
The doughty creatures are unmoved by the kerfuffle surrounding them as they move slowly upwards with their supplies of rice , soybean oil and San Miguel beer .
Welcome to the Everest Marathon , which was run this week ( Wednesday ) for the 12th time since its inception in 1987 .
As well as the world 's highest marathon , it can justifiably claim to be the most spectacular .
Starting at 5184 m ( 17,000 ft ) above sea level at Gorak Shep , a settlement situated two hours from Everest Base Camp , the route descends to Namche , at 3446 m ( 11,300 ft ) , before a punishing three - mile loop up to the village of Thamo ( 3500 m ) and back to complete the 26.2 miles .
' Descends ' is a relative concept , though , since participants have to tackle around 1,000 m ( 3,300 ft ) of climbs on the rocky , sometimes icy , mountain paths along the way .
It may be the most stunning start to a marathon anywhere , with a panorama of Himalayan giants stretching from the 7,165 m peak of Pumo Ri to the awesome west face of Nuptse ( 7,861 m ) , with the tip of Mt. Everest poking its head up , peering down on the runners .
But the first mile , notwithstanding the - 20C temperatures for the 6.30 am start , is brutal .
It includes four uphill sections over the lateral moraine of the Khumbu glacier , a narrow path strewn with boulders , stones and yak dung , every step a potential ankle - twister .
Some would have been happy merely to reach the start in one piece .
As David Beckler , the chief medic at this year 's event , says : " The secret to the race is getting to the start line .
We do n't have many not finish , but quite a few do n't start . "
The first three winners were all locals
The 70 ' Western ' competitors , drawn mostly from Britain , with a dozen from New Zealand , a couple of Germans , and lone representatives from Denmark , France and Singapore , all paid £ 1400 each for the privilege of entering .
In addition 19 Nepalis , many of them Sherpas , compete for the limited prize money - £ 500 , or 60,000 Nepali rupees , to the first male home , £ 250 to the first female , with decreasing amounts for second and third .
The ' Westerners ' arrive in Nepal 17 days before the start to try to acclimatise their bodies to the extraordinary demands of extreme exertion at high altitude .
They walk the same routes and climb some of the same peaks as the thousands of trekkers who flock to one of the world 's most exhilarating mountain regions each year .
But inevitably problems ensue , with many suffering forms of stomach and chest ailments common to visitors .
George Dodd , a 65 - year - old Irishman , was the oldest original entrant but had to be flown out with a suspected heart condition .
It is the toughest marathon you are ever going to do , and I just wanted to do it once .
Angela Mudge
But it is not just the elderly who succumb to altitude - related problems .
Louise Murray , a 30 - year - old Scot , spends half her year working above 2,000 m ( 6,500 ft ) in the French Alps .
But when she started to experience intense pain around her eyes on top of a severe headache in Gokyo , at 4,800 m , a week before the race , a traumatic night ensued .
Murray had some classic symptoms of acute mountain sickness , with fluid starting to collect in her brain .
She was given oxygen , steroids , and placed in a portable hyperbaric pressure chamber , also known as a Gamow Bag , where she spent the night with a worried boyfriend Jamie in a sleeping bag alongside her .
Every five minutes a porter would blow more air into the chamber to keep it at the right pressure .
" There was a small window in the bag so I could see Jamie and we could shout at each other through it , " Murray recalled .
" But it was a pretty miserable experience . "
The next morning she was helped down the valley a little way , and made a rapid recovery as her blood oxygen level returned to something approaching normal .
Remarkably she completed the marathon a week later , in under eight hours .
Fellow Scot Angela Mudge , a sports masseuse who lives near Stirling and is a member of the Carnethy Hill Running Club in Edinburgh , had no such problems .
The 37 - year - old , originally from Tavistock in Devon , is a world champion in sky running , a form of fell running in mountainous areas such as the Pyrenees and the Dolomites .
She is now the new women 's record holder for the Everest Marathon , having covered the course in five hours and three minutes , beating the previous record of former Macclesfield Harrier Anne Stentiford , whose 5 hrs 16 mins had stood since 1997 .
" I had absolutely no idea what to expect , " Mudge said .
" I race all around the world but have done nothing to compare with this .
Angela Mudge poses at the finish with her medal
" It is the toughest marathon you are ever going to do , and I just wanted to do it once .
I always wanted to visit Nepal , and I love using my running to see places . "
Mudge finished eighth overall , the first woman home , and the second ' Westerner ' .
The first , much to his surprise , was Craig Mattocks , a 34 - year - old building surveyor from Northampton , where he is a member of the Wootton Road Runners Club .
" I 'm chuffed to bits , I was just hoping for something under six hours , " he said , having covered the course in 4 hrs 53 mins to finish fifth .
" I do quite a lot of road running , and did some fell races in preparation for this .
But I really just wanted to come to the Himalaya and enjoy the scenery . "
Indeed , for the majority of the participants , it is not about times or competition .
The physical and mental challenge is certainly there , but the camaraderie gained from three weeks with a similarly - minded group of people , in the breathtaking scenery of Nepal , is at least as important , if not more so , than the race itself .
John Bull , at 61 the oldest Briton in this year 's race , is a case in point .
" I walked all the way " , he said after completing the 42 km in a little over nine hours , still three hours faster than the stragglers who arrived in Namche around 6.30 pm .
" These guys who do it in four hours or something are crazy - they miss all the scenery ! "
The men's record for the event is 3 hrs 50 mins ( Haile Gebrselassie 's marathon world record is 2:04:26 by way of comparison ) , set in 2000 by Hari Roka , a three - time winner .
This year Nepalis took the first four places , with the glory going to Lok Bahadur Rokaya , a 27 - year - old Nepali who works as an armed police officer in Kathmandu .
He finished in 4 hrs 12 mins , 20 minutes ahead of the second - placed finisher , Karma Rita Sherpa , who hails from Phortse , at the foot of the Khumbu valley .
But the spirit of the event is perhaps best summed up by the lone Singaporean entrant , Steven Wong , who finished in 9 hrs , 15 mins .
The 48 - year - old , who has run six marathons - including the Great Wall of China event - since taking up this " crazy sport " three years ago , saw snow for the first time , and suffered badly in the freezing temperatures .
" But I survived , and I am so proud , " he said .
" I wanted to do something different and for me this is a unique event .
It was a once - in - a- lifetime experience . "

MSNBC : Why fund abstinence - only programs that do n't work ?

This A new study has concluded that abstinence - only education programs do nothing to reduce or delay sexual activity among teenagers , confirming a Congressional report released last spring .
Yet these programs are receiving nearly $ 200 million in federal funding and Congress is prepared to increase this by another $ 28 million .
MSNBC host Dan Abrams commented on the proposed increase , saying , " It seems to me absurd that Democrats in Congress ca n't say ' We 're going to cut it off . '
Instead they 're using this as bait and constantly saying , ' Oh , you know , we 'll trade you . ' "
" I 'm hoping this is a trick , " added Abrams ' co-host , Rachel Maddow of Air America Radio .
" For the Democratic Congress to go along with it ?
I 'm hoping there 's something I do n't understand about that . "
Abrams then turned to Valerie Huber of the National Abstinence Education Association and asked her how , if she disagrees with the studies , she would explain why 14 states are refusing federal funding for abstinence - only programs " We know that 's a part of a coordinated plan by historic opponents of abstinence education , " Huber replied confidently .
" Through misinformation ... they are convincing governors that this is not a good plan . "
Huber stated further that the Congressional study which concluded abstinence education is n't working really means that " we need to have more of it , not less . "
Maddow broke in to argue that abstinence - only education is not only useless but actively harmful , because it does n't give young people the information on pregnancy and sexually - transmitted diseases that they need to keep them safe when they do have sex .
" That 's not true at all , " said Huber .
" Abstinence education provides a realistic and accurate discussion of contraception , all within the context of why abstinence is the best choice .
Teens are presented all the information necessary to make wise decisions . "
Abrams put up figures showing that 58 % of US teens have had sex before the age of 18 , many of them with multiple partners .
" Let 's deal with the reality , " he said .
" I guess that the position of abstinence - only is to just go like this [ hands over eyes ] and say ' Oh , please tell me they 're not going to do it . ' "
" Teens are resonating with the message of abstinence - only education in increasing numbers , " insisted Huber .
" More and more teens are abstaining . "
" That 's not what the studies show ! "
Abrams exclaimed .
" $ 200 million for a program that is at the very least controversial ? "
Abrams concluded .
" Does n't seem to me to be a very good use of taxpayer dollars . "
A transcript of this program is available HERE .
The following video is from MSNBC's Abrams Report , broadcast on December 04 , 2007
Germany has long investigated Scientology as a cult and a criminal organization .
It may now formally ban the organization under a proposal out of Hamburg .
Hamburg ’s secretary of the interior , Udo Nagel , is seeking a nationwide ban , which will require the approval of all 16 states in Germany .
Germany views the organization as abusive and a threat to human rights .
While other countries take dim views of the activities of Scientology , Germany has been the most aggressive , including recent investigations of possible murder and scams connected to the organization .
While the U.S. has had a rocky relationship with Scientology and for years refused to recognize it as a religion , it has criticized Germany for intolerance in the matter and now treats Scientology as a religion .

Notes : Matt Ray 's ongoing research has updated data and discussion .
Mao is widely credited in the West with tens of millions of killings ( 49-78,000,000 ) but the sources are generally vague and contradictory .
It is particularly difficult to pin down the deaths of the Cultural Revolution on him .
Even assuming that the numbers are correct ( and living witnesses saw very few people die during those years ) , Mao certainly started it , but after a few months he had lost control over the events , and there is no evidence whatsoever that he ordered or approved the many killings committed in the name of the Cultural Revolution : they were not carried out by the army or the police but by radicals .
Crimes committed by the " red guards " cannot be automatically blamed on him .
His wife Jiang Qing is widely despised in China and considered to have exerted an evil influence on those events ( and was eventually arrested ) .
In 1968 Mao called for " Big Unity " between the radical and conservative factions that were fighting all over China ( not for more blood but for less blood ) .
Before dying he appointed Hua Guofeng , a provincial governor , as his successor bypassing all the senior officials who were responsible for the excesses of the Cultural Revolution .
The Cultural Revolution indirectly caused starvation , but the number of people who died of that starvation is probably lower than Westerners thought ( again , judging from living witnesses ) and he can only be considered indirectly responsible for them .
A failed policy does not constitute " genocide " ( otherwise this list of genociders would be much longer ) .
I read Burying Mao , The Unknown Story and many other books on China .
I also happen to travel frequently to China ( 3 months total over 2014 - 15 ) and have Chinese friends both in the USA and China who grew up during the Cultural Revolution .
I am obviously not a fan of the Chinese regime ( my website was banned in China for a while ) but my view is that we still do n't have a clear understanding of what happened under Mao .
None of my Chinese friends and none of their parents know someone who was killed during the 1950s / 60s : not a family member , not a friend , not a neighbor , not even a friend 's friend 's friend .
Contrast with the Holocaust : virtually every older German and Pole knows of at least one Jewish family that disappeared during World War II .
Nonetheless , all books on Mao published in the West routinely talk of millions killed under Mao .
But there is really no study to justify those numbers .
Whenever you read that he is responsible for 10 , 20 , 30 ... 70 million deaths , you should notice that they do n't provide any evidence that would fly in a court of law .
We literally do n't have the names of those 70 million people who supposedly were killed under Mao ( we do have the names of the people killed in Hitler 's death camps , and the names of the people killed in Stalin 's gulags ) .
The avalanche of anti-Mao books started in the 1980s after Deng Xiaoping launched an ideological campaign against the legacy of the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution .
Ye Jian Ying 's speech in 1979 and Liu Zeng 's report of 1981 ( both attacking the Great Leap Forward ) were widely publicized by the Communist Party .
Many books published in the West are simply quoting the figures published by Deng 's clique back then without realizing that Deng 's agenda was not to tell the truth but to defeat his opponents within the Communist Party .
His enemies were the ones who had worked with Mao on the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution , therefore Deng had to discredit both events .
We cannot trust any study published in China in the 1980s , at the peak of this ideological war , but most Western books are based precisely on those " revelations " .
The first major Western " studies " about Mao's massacres came out in the China Quarterly , and to this day those " studies " are routinely plagiarized in books and magazines .
Well , we now know that this journal was covertly funded by the CIA ( London Review of Books , Volume 23 , no. 10 , 24 May 2001 ) .
That magazine never funded any study aimed at defending Mao .
It only funded studied to discredit him .
Eyewitness accounts cited by Jasper Becker , Jung Chang , and others are just not enough to conclude that tens of millions of people were killed .
At most , an impartial jury would reach the conclusion that Mao is responsible for a few thousand deaths ( keeping aside the civil war during which atrocities were committed by both sides ) .
I respect historians like Richard Baum , Frank Dikotter , Jung Chang , Judith Banister , Richard MacFarquhar , etc but for every book that alleges Mao is responsible for those deaths one could write a book alleging the opposite .
It is just that in the West we do n't have historians interested in defending Mao .
It would n't be difficult to write a book showing that the Great Leap Forward actually improved China 's economy and that life expectancy in the 1960s increased ( a number that is hardly consistent with the claim that 70 million people died a premature death ) .
I could list dozens of papers published over the years by economists , sociologists and technologists who had no political agenda but happen to reach conclusions that one could use to paint a brighter picture of Mao 's era .
( I have no interest in doing this because i do n't like Mao , and would n't want to spend the rest of my life defending those papers ) .
In other words , we tend to be victims of China 's own anti-Mao propaganda , taking for literally true what was originally a project to marginalize Mao 's allies .
That project succeeded , but it does n't mean that Mao 's allies were lying and that Mao 's enemies were telling the truth .
We do n't really scrutinize anti-Mao books the same way we scrutinize books on other subjects .
Banister , for example , assumes " under - reporting of deaths " and unilaterally decides how many people died .
She is not saying " people reported x number of deaths " but " people did not report x number of deaths " and then goes on to conclude that millions died .
Chang claims to have interviewed Mao's English teacher Zhang Hanzhi , not knowing that Zhang read the New York Times , and , having found out about that claim , she wrote to the newspaper that she never even met Chang .
If this had been a book attacking George W Bush , Fox News would have spent days hammering it .
But nobody does it when it 's a book about Mao .
The numbers for Stalin have decreased in recent years by admission of the Ukrainian authorities .
If you have read a book published before 2010 , that book was not aware of this recent admissions .
It is not clear how many deaths were caused by the famine of 1946 - 47 and by the forced settlements , and how much responsibility can be placed on him .
The atrocities committed by right - wing dictators have always been easier to track down than the crimes against humanity committed by communist leaders , so the figures for communist leaders like Stalin and Mao are mere guesses .
We also do n't know how many dissidents have been killed by order of Kim Il Sung in North Korea , although Westerners suspect many thousands .
I often get asked if Hiroshima / Nagasaki qualify as a genocide .
I disagree .
First of all , why only nuclear weapons ?
The carpet bombings of German cities and of Tokyo killed the same numbers of people .
Second , Winston Churchill and Harry Truman did not start that war : they ended it .
It is even debatable if these bombings killed or saved lives : Hiroshima probably saved a lot of Japanese lives , because a long protracted invasion like the one that took place in Germany would have killed a lot more people ( Germany lost 2 million people , Japan only 300,000 , because Japan was never invaded , while Germany was invaded from all sides ) .
Actually , more Japanese died in two weeks of battles with the Soviet Union in Manchuria than in the two nuclear bombings .
As horrific as it sounds , i suspect that a nuclear bomb on Berlin would have killed 100,000 people but caused Germany to surrender right away , thus saving many German lives .
( I know , it is gruesome to count dead bodies like this ; but , again , i did n't start that war , Germany and Japan started it ) .
The USA had a casualty rate of 35 % in the battle of Okinawa : they expected to lose one million soldiers in a land invasion of Japan , and the estimates were that Japan would lose the same number of soldiers and many more civilians .
Most historians believe that it was the atomic bomb that convinced Japan to surrender , and it was the second one : after the first one , there were still members of the Japanese cabinet who were opposed to surrender ( the cabinet had to be unanimous in order for the emperor to surrender ) .
The dissenters who wanted to continue the war even tried a coup to overthrow the emperor rather than obey the order to surrender .
After the first bomb , Nishina ( head of the Japanese nuclear program ) was asked if it were possible that the USA could build another atomic bomb within six months : obviously the people who asked him the question were not going to surrender unless a second bomb was possible .
Koichi Kido , advisor to emperor Hirohito , said : " We of the peace party were assisted by the atomic bomb in our endeavor to end the war . "
Hisatsune Sakomizu , chief secretary of Cabinet , said that the atomic bombs were a " golden opportunity given by heaven for Japan to end the war . "
Thus the Japanese themselves ( those who wanted to surrender ) seem to indicate that the two atomic bombs were indispensable to end a war that was killing hundreds of thousands of people per battle ( the battle of Okinawa killed more Japanese than the atomic bomb on Nagasaki ) .
It is also estimated that throughout Japan - occupied Asia about 200,000 civilians were dying every month ( of disease , hunger , etc ) : if the atomic bombs helped Japan surrender even just six months earlier , that saved the lives of one million Indonesians , Indochinese , Philipinos , Chinese , etc .
( Notable dissenting voices were the two most powerful USA generals , Dwight Eisenhower and Douglas MacArthur , who both felt that the atomic bombs were unnecessary to finish Japan ) .
People die in wars .
During the previous world - war , millions died of everything from guns to chemical weapons .
The fact that a more or less efficient weapon is used to fight a war does not constitute genocide , per se .
It is not the weapon , but the intent .
Churchill 's and Truman 's intent was to end the war , not to exterminate the peoples ( which they could have done easily , had they wanted to ) .
In fact , i think that Churchill and Truman are exemplary of how to treat a defeated enemy : instead of annihilating the enemies , they helped Germany and Japan to rebuild themselves and become stronger and wealthier than they had been before the war .
It may have been the first time in history .
Furthermore , we know that Werner Heisenberg in Germany and Yoshio Nishina in Japan were working on an atomic bomb : what if they had had the time to complete one ?
Heisenberg in Germany had failed to correctly calculate the critical mass of uranium required to sustain a chain reaction , but Nishina in Japan had just done that in 1944 .
It was a matter of time before German and Japanese scientists would find out the right recipe .
Thus the first bomb saved a lot of lives , probably millions of lives ( not just Japanese lives , but lives of all the nations that were being massacred by the Japanese ) .
Last but not least , the USA dropped 720,000 leaflets on Hiroshima and other cities two days earlier , warning of the impending destruction of the city .
It is certainly debatable , instead , if the second atomic bomb was necessary .
The USA only waited three days to see the effect of the first atomic bomb and of its leaflets .
Today sitting in our living rooms we can calmly debate this issue forever .
Of course , it was a different kind of decision for the man sitting in the White House in the middle of a world war that had been raging for four years .
I 've been asked why i blame the USA only for part of the civilian deaths in Vietnam while i blame the Soviet Union for all of the civilian casualties in Afghanistan .
The USA " invasion " of Vietnam is not as clearcut as the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan :
1 . Even today many in Vietnam think that the aggressor was North Vietnam , not the USA , at least at the beginning , whereas everybody in Afghanistan blames the Soviet Union for that invasion .
Nobody welcomed the Soviet Union , whereas about half of Vietnam welcomed the USA .
2 . When the Soviet Union withdrew , almost no Afghan followed them , whereas , when the USA withdrew , about eight million Vietnamese left with them and about three million ran away from Vietnam in the following decades risking their lives ( the " boat people " ) .
3 . There are documented large - scale atrocities by the North Vietnamese against their own population ( read the Black Book of Communism ) while i have n't seen evidence of any large - scale atrocity by the Afghan fighters against their own population
4. The Soviet Union tried to invade the WHOLE of Afghanistan .
The USA never tried to invade the northern part of Vietnam : it simply fought the Vietcong that wanted to annex south Vietnam to north Vietnam ( if you read the history of the country , north and south Vietnam have fought wars for more than 1,000 years : go to the Timeline of Indochina and look for Annam and Champa .
the ancient names of the two kingdoms ) .
When the USA bombed civilians in North Vietnam , Laos and Cambodia ( countries that had never attacked the USA nor anyone else ) , then i consider it a war crime .
( Germany and Japan had attacked their neighbors and killed millions of them - carpet bombing German and Japanese cities was a way to protect those millions of people from further massacres ) .
The most frequently asked questions are always about current unpopular USA presidents : Reagan , Bush I , Clinton , Bush II ...
The moment the USA elects a new president , i start receiving emails asking to add him to the list of " genociders " .
The moment the president leaves office the same people forget about him and jump on the next one .
Can we consider George W Bush a genocider due to all of the civilians killed in Iraq under his watch ?
I do n't think so , because the vast majority of civilians killed in Iraq were NOT killed by US troops and certainly not by his order .
It is genocide , but the " genociders " are others , and the situation is still too murky to decide who exactly killed those 100,000 civilians .
( If Bush is indirectly guilty of it , then certainly Islam is too ) .
The USA bears some clear responsibilities for the chaos , but ineptitude , miscalculation , ignorance , etc do not qualify as genocide .
Otherwise the United Nations and France would be responsible for the genocide in Rwanda ( 900,000 people ) .
Even if one wanted to count all the civilians killed in that civil war as Bush 's and Blair 's responsibility , it would be ( as of 2013 , long after the USA and Britain withdrew ) 120,000 people in ten years , i.e. 12,000 a year .
In 20 years Saddam Hussein was responsible for the killing of 600,000 people ( that he personally ordered ) , an average of 30,000 a year plus the victims of his invasion of Iran .
Therefore , technically speaking one could argue that the war , by removing Saddam , saved lives .
Putin would be a better candidate for " genocider " , since the vast majority of Chechen civilians killed under his watch were killed by Russian troops .
However , i have never received a single email nominating Putin ...
Specifically about Bush II ( the hot topic between 2003 and 2008 ) .
I have seen no evidence whatsoever that he or anybody working for him or the British prime minister or the Australian prime minister wanted to kill Iraqi civilians .
And even less evidence that Iraqi civilians were killed in any large number by US soldiers .
The Iraqi civilians killed by US soldiers are estimated at about 4 % of all deaths , which is a little over 5,000 .
With all due respect for those families , a seven - year war that kills only 5,000 people ( less than 1,000 a year ) does not register anywhere in the history of the world .
All the other civilians were killed by militias , suicide bombers , etc. and almost always in the name of Islam ( so it would be more appropriate to vent your anger at that religion than at the USA ) .
In fact , documents show that some caution was taken by the US and Britain to avoid mass civilian casualties .
Compare with Vietnam , when the US bombed densely populated areas knowing that thousands of civilians would die .
In fact , the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan might be the first large - scale wars in which the winners went out of their way to avoid mass civilian casualties .
Compare with any other war .
Future generations ( who will face other crises and will be more concerned with their presidents than with Bush II ) may see more clearly who is responsible for those killings .
Most of them were killed by fellow Iraqis or at least fellow Muslims , not by US soldiers .
Once we remove all the personal emotions against this or that politician , it is self - evident who / what killed those Iraqi civilians .
If you simply scream hysterically against the president of the USA , you are not helping solve the real problem of those places .
Coming to more serious issues , Lothar von Trotha massacred the Herero and Namaqua in Namibia in 1904 - 1907 .
That episode is not listed here ( despite the large number of victims ) because the German government never ordered those massacres .
Once the facts became known , outrage in Germany among the political class forced the Kaiser to fire Von Trotha .
So i consider this event the folly of one overzealous and racist man rather than a real genocide .
Slobodan Milosevic 's responsibility for the Yugoslavian civil war is probably proven beyond doubt but he 's involvement in the genocides is not clear .
Radovan Karadzic and his general Ratko Mladic were responsible for the genocide in Bosnia .
Kosovo was not quite a genocide .
What are the defining discoveries and great developments that are shaping the way we use materials and technologies today ?
Elsevier 's Materials Today magazine has compiled a list of the top ten most significant advances in materials science over the last 50 years .
The top ten includes advances that have altered all our daily lives .
Some have completely changed the research arena , and others have opened up new possibilities and capabilities .
They are :
The International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors Scanning probe microscopes Giant magnetoresistive effect Semiconductor lasers and light - emitting diodes National Nanotechnology Initiative Carbon fiber reinforced plastics Materials for Li ion batteries Carbon nanotubes Soft lithography Metamaterials
Surprisingly , top of the list is not a research discovery , but a way of organizing research priorities and planning R&D .
The International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors ( ITRS ) drives the incredible progress of the microelectronics industry by setting out goals for innovation and technology needs .
A mixture of science , technology , and economics , it is hard to see how the ITRS could do better in driving forward advances in this area .
" I believe it is an appropriate first choice in our list , " says Jonathan Wood , editor of Materials Today .
" Not only is electronics critical to our modern world , progress in semiconductor processing and advances in materials science have gone hand - in - hand for the last 50 years . "
Materials science studies what makes up our world -- the metals , semiconductors , plastics we use to make all our devices , products , and technologies .
It can be how to make smaller , faster transistors to give more powerful computers ; understanding the electrical properties of polymers to produce cheap displays for cell phones ; or analyzing how tissues in the body bond to medical implants .
" I want this list to be a celebration of the achievements of materials science , " says Wood .
" Too often , this diverse , dynamic field gets squeezed out by the big boys of chemistry and physics .
Yet it is crucial to so much of today 's world . "
Washington ( TGW ) – A bill that would end billions of dollars in tax breaks for the oil industry and raise mileage standards hit a roadblock in the Senate today .
The bill failed on a procedural vote 7 votes short of the needed 60 majority , 53 - 42 .
The law would require car manufacturers to raise their mileage standards up to 35 miles per gallon by 2020 .
The current standard , 27.5 mpg was passed in 1975 .
Senators said the vote did not mean the bill was done for .
" This does n't mark the end of this bill , " said Sen. Pete Domenici of New Mexico , the ranking Republican on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee .
" It means we have to go to work to fix some of the problems that the House bill has generated for us . "
The panel ’s Democratic chairman thought a new version could make it onto the floor by next week .
The bill also includes standards to repeal $ 13 billion in tax breaks for the oil industry , and to require electricity utility companies generate 15 percent of their energy from renewable sources by 2020 .
President Bush has threatened to veto the bill .

KUSHIRO , Japan —
In the early 1980s , engineers straightened out stretches of the Kushiro River , which had meandered some 100 miles under Hokkaido ’s big sky here in northern Japan , flowing through green hill country and rural towns , winding through the nation ’s largest wetland and this port city ’s downtown before emptying into the Pacific Ocean .
Later in November , work is to start again .
But this time bulldozers will be moving earth to put curves back in a stretch of the river that had been straightened out , restoring its original , sinuous , shape .
For decades , Japan pursued economic development at all costs , but it is now emphasizing the importance of protecting the environment .
So under a 2003 law that aims to reverse decades of destruction , the Kushiro River will be the first of perhaps many straightened rivers to regain some of its original curves .
Still , in a country famous for heedlessly paving rural areas in concrete to create jobs and to buttress the half - century rule of the Liberal Democratic Party , some environmentalists and local residents are skeptical of the new projects .
With no rivers left to straighten , they say , the authorities nowadays are simply starting to curve them instead .
Can politicians and bureaucrats be trusted to repair nature ?

Houston Marine recruiters busted in exam fraud Stand -ins took test required of 15 marginal enlistees
Nine Marine Corps recruiters who worked in the Houston area were punished for using fraudulent stand - ins to take military - entrance exams for prospective recruits who might not otherwise measure up , the military confirmed Wednesday .
Eight of the recruiters were reassigned and given non-judicial punishment , which could include fines and reduction in rank .
Another , considered the worst offender , was discharged from the service .
" I do n't know why this happened here .
Obviously , we do not tolerate it , " said Capt .
John Niemann , a spokesman for the recruiting district that includes Houston .
" We learned of it .
We investigated it and took appropriate disciplinary action . "
Niemann said privacy regulations prohibit him from releasing the names of the recruiters , what punishments they were given or when .
" The bottom line is that it is all cleaned up , " he said .
Word of the scandal comes as recruiters are under continued pressure to find people willing to join the military in a time of war .
Although officials are unsure how widespread the practice was or where the recruiters learned of the technique , the fraud was traced to 15 incidents .
Recruits who had the test taken on their behalf faced a range of repercussions , from being kicked out of the service , to being given a chance to take the exam , to in at least one instance , being able to continue on the job .
Officials declined to say who the test takers were .
Four of the recruiters were based in Memorial City , one in Lake Jackson , one in Baybrook and two in Houston , according to the Marine Corps .
Tim Hanley , 60 , a Vietnam War veteran and president of the Houston chapter of the 1st Marine Division Association , a nationwide veterans ' group , said he is worried how this might reflect on the Corps .
" As a Marine , this is really quite disturbing to me .
I guess they have bean counters in every profession now — that is a shame , " he said of the pressure to meet recruiting quotas .
" You have got to want to be a Marine and meet the standards , " he said .
" Not everybody can be a Marine .
If they could , we would n't be so proud to be one . "
Harold Hyman , a Rice University professor emeritus of history and a Marine in World War II , said he felt pity for recruiters who broke the law in a desperate race to meet quotas because of the Iraq war .
He noted that recruiters have been known for generations to go to great lengths to sign anyone up .
Probe began in April
Although the scam was made public Wednesday in response to a Houston Chronicle inquiry , evidence of wrongdoing began quietly unfolding last April when officials at the Military Entrance Processing Station , located downtown , noticed that signatures of test takers did n't match those on enlistment forms , Niemann said .
It is not clear how long it had been going on , he said .
The Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery is a lengthy test of aptitudes used to place recruits in military jobs to which they are best suited .
It 's the military version of the SAT .
Results could determine whether a person meets a minimum threshold to enter the service , as well as whether they may end up marching and firing a weapon or sitting behind a desk .
Maj .
Wesley Hayes , of the Marine Corps Recruiting Command headquarters in Virginia , said the test is a basic hurdle .
" It is a requirement if you go into the Marine Corps , " said Hayes , who added that about 35,600 people entered the Marine Corps the last fiscal year , just surpassing the Corps ' goal for recruitment .
Jack Hirschfield , a spokesman for U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul , an Austin Republican who represents portions of western Harris County , said he believed the scandal was not widespread .
" We see this as a few bad apples and absolutely not representative of the Corps and the tens of thousands of brave men and women on the front lines trying to fight for freedom and security in Iraq and Afghani - stan , " he said .
" We do not , under any circumstances , believe this is a practice that reaches beyond the nine ; this is not what the Marine Corps is about , stands for or represents — we know that and believe it strongly . "

Trolltech has released the Qt 4.4.0 technical preview , a pre-release that allows software developers to begin experimenting with the new features that the company has implemented for the next version .
Qt is an open - source development toolkit that simplifies cross-platform application development .
Qt serves as the underlying widget system for the KDE desktop environment and is also used in some popular cross-platform commercial applications like Skype , Google Earth , and Adobe Photoshop Elements .
I compiled the technical preview release from source code and tested it on my desktop computer with Ubuntu 7.10 .
For testing purposes , I experimented with several of the new features , examined the included demo applications , and created a few simple programs of my own .
The 4.4.0 technical preview adds a new concurrency framework , enhanced XML support , the Phonon media framework , and an integrated HTML renderer widget based on WebKit .
This release is also the first to include support for rendering widgets on a Graphics View component — a feature that will enable Qt developers to create richer and more dynamic user interfaces .
Phonon : a sound strategy
The Phonon multimedia framework is an abstraction layer that makes it possible for developers to swap seamlessly between various underlying media libraries without having to re-implement application code .
Phonon was originally developed by the open source software community for KDE 4 , but has also been adopted by Trolltech for inclusion in Qt. Trolltech created several new backends for Phonon and has contributed the source code to KDE with the intention of continuing all Phonon development under the aegis of the KDE project .
Supported Phonon backends include Xine , GStreamer , Quicktime 7 on Mac OS X , and DirectShow 9 on Windows .
The inclusion of Mac and Windows backends makes it possible for developers to create multimedia applications that are compatible with those operating systems without having to write custom platform - specific code .
Phonon also makes it so that API changes in underlying media engines will only have to be dealt with in one place — at the toolkit level — rather than in every application .
Although Phonon simplifies development of cross-platform media playback and recording applications and makes it easier to leverage new media engines as needed , the limitations of the somewhat sparse API make it unsuitable for more elaborate software like audio and video editing programs .
WebKit in Qt : a new spin on Apple 's web
Phonon is n't the only new feature in Qt 4.4.0 that has its origins in the KDE community .
The 4.4.0 technical preview also includes WebKit , an HTML rendering engine that Apple developed based on KDE 's KHTML framework .
In addition to serving as the HTML renderer in Apple 's Safari web browser , WebKit is used in various contexts by Nokia , Adobe , and Google .
Trolltech has integrated support for WebKit directly into Qt , making it easy for developers to embed WebKit renderers in their Qt applications .
The toolkit provides WebKit through a QWebView widget that can be used like any other Qt widget and exposes functionality through regular Qt properties and signals .
The QWebView widget is even supported by Qt Designer , Trolltech 's drag - and - drop user - interface design tool .
A QWebView widget on a form in Qt Designer
Trolltech initially announced plans to include WebKit in Qt at Akademy 2007 , a KDE event that took place in Glasgow .
The announcement was a major factor that influenced prominent members of the KDE community to advocate adoption of WebKit in KDE 's Konqueror web browser .
For more insight into the broader implications of WebKit for the KDE community , check out Troy 's article about the KHTML / WebKit unforking from earlier this year .
Widgets on QGraphicsView : bring the bling
One of the most visually impressive new features in the Qt 4.4.0 technical preview is support for widgets on Qt's QGraphics View canvas .
The QGraphicsView widget , which was added in Qt 4.2 to replace QCanvas , offers an object - oriented model / view system for laying out and manipulating 2D graphical items .
In the technical preview , regular Qt widgets can now be added to the QGraphicsView and manipulated like any other canvas item .
This feature is implemented with full support for input redirection , which means that users can still fully interact with widgets that are rendered on the canvas .
This makes it possible to create sophisticated widget transition animations and rich user interfaces that incorporate graphics alongside regular controls .
Widgets on the canvas can be transformed in many different ways , and support scaling , rotation , angle adjustment , color filters , and all sorts of other neat tricks .
Several simple applications are included to demonstrate various ways that developers can take advantage of this functionality .
One of the demos shows an assortment of miniature dialog windows that jump out at an angle when the cursor moves over them .
Another demo shows a series of buttons on a flat pane that seems to spin around and display widgets on the back in response to clicks .
Trolltech 's embedded dialog QGraphicsView demo
The embedded dialog demo made me giddy with excitement , so I decided to play with the source code , which is included with the technical preview .
Using the embedded dialog demo as a starting point , I had no trouble at all adapting the code to use other widgets .
I wanted to test it with a widget that does particularly sophisticated rendering , so I plopped down a QWebView .
Much to my surprise , it rendered pretty darn well .
I can imagine using something like this to implement a Cover Flow - style tab switcher for a web browser , for instance .
A QWebView scaled and at an angle , rendered on a QGraphicsView
Adding support for widgets on the QGraphicsView was obviously an extremely challenging undertaking .
The Trolltech developers seem quite proud of what they have accomplished .
In a blog entry from October , developer Andreas Hanssen talks about some of the challenges that they faced when they were implementing the feature .
" Early on , I was worried about many things .
Prior to 4.2 , I was almost convinced that adding embedded widget support to Graphics View would be an insane operation ... Looking back , I do n't quite understand how we 've made it ... [ W ] e've found solutions to almost every single problem that we foresaw .
And we even uncovered more problems .
And solved those too .
And what we got , what we have , and what we 're honing , stabilizing , testing and reviewing these days , makes me emotional , " wrote Hanssen .
" I had the sensation that things were fitting so well together that you 'd almost think we had n't invented these APIs , but rather uncovered ancient APIs from a past civilization . "
Indeed , the few remaining problems are actively being resolved .
During my tests I only encountered two issues with using widgets on the QGraphicsView .
The first problem is that popups ( like the menu that comes out of a combo box ) are n't rendered properly yet .
Hanssen has actually already come up with a way to fix this problem , but the patch is n't in the technical preview .
The other problem is with performance .
Applications with widgets on QGraphicsViews seem to be very processor intensive .
This issue is also currently being addressed .
In light of the fact that this is a pre-release technical preview , bugs like this are entirely forgiveable .
It 's likely that these issues wo n't remain in the final release version of Qt 4.4 .
Conclusion
There are several other noteworthy features in the Qt 4.4.0 technical preview , but obviously a complete examination is well beyond the scope of this article .
More information is available at Trolltech 's sneak preview page .
The source code for the technical preview for Windows , Linux , and Mac OS X is available for download from Trolltech 's web site .
Trolltech 's demo application showcases
Qt 's features
GTK is my toolkit of choice for the vast majority of my Linux desktop application development , so my perspective on Qt is that of an outsider looking in at a very different kind development platform .
Despite my limited familiarity with the toolkit , I 'm very impressed with the new functionality in Qt 4.4 , and I 'm looking forward to seeing how the KDE community and other Qt users leverage the features .
LONDON ( Reuters ) - Brian May , lead guitarist from rock band Queen who has just completed a doctorate in astrophysics , was on Monday named as the next chancellor to Liverpool John Moores University .
Brian May , member of the band Queen , performs during their " European Tour 2005 " at the Palau Sant Jordi Stadium in Barcelona in this April 2 , 2005 file photo .
May , who will take up the role early next year , became an honorary fellow of the university earlier this year in recognition of his contribution to the arts and for encouraging public understanding of science with his book “ Bang !
The Complete History of the Universe . ”
The university said it was a tribute to May , 60 , that he had gone back to finish his doctorate after leaving his studies in his mid-20s to pursue a career in rock music .
“ Not only is Brian an icon in his own sphere but he is a real academic star as well , ” said the chairman of the university ’s board , Sir Malcolm Thornton , in a statement .
“ He perfectly embodies the ‘ can do ’ attitude of LJMU ; he is going to be a great Chancellor for the students and a wonderful figurehead for the University . ”
May said in the statement that it was an honor and a great challenge to take up the new position .
May was studying astrophysics at Imperial College , London , when he formed Queen with singer Freddie Mercury and drummer Roger Taylor in 1970 .
He dropped his doctorate research into interstellar dust as the band met with increasing success .
After Mercury ’s AIDS - related death in 1991 , May , the writer of such hits as “ We Will Rock You ” and “ Fat Bottomed Girls , ” recorded several solo albums and set up the Brian May Band .
But his interest in astronomy continued , and he co-wrote “ Bang !
The Complete History of the Universe ” with Patrick Moore and Chris Lintott which was published last year .
In October this year , May completed his PhD thesis “ A Survey of Radial Velocities in the Zodiacal Dust Cloud . ”
“ In this age of celebrity culture , it is rare to find someone who has fame , fortune and universal acclaim and yet who remains true to his core values of learning and enlightenment , ” said the university ’s vice chancellor Michael Brown .
May will be the fourth chancellor of the university and follows Cherie Booth , the wife of the former prime minister Tony Blair , who held the position from 1999 to 2006 .
The university said its chancellor plays a vital role in raising the profile of the institution by acting as an ambassador for the university and its staff and students .
さて、ここでシュリンクの歴史を紐解いてみましょう。そもそもコミックのシュリンクはいつ誰が始めたものなのでしょうか？コミックのシュリンクを書店業界で一番最初に始めた人は「こうしたほうが売上があがる」と必ずや考えていたはずなのです。そりゃそうですよね。では、その方のお話を聞いてみることにしましょう。
「 シュリンクを始めたきっかけはね、コミックが猛烈に売れ始めた当時、コミックを買いにきてたお客さんは、ほとんどみんな雑誌で連載を読んでから来てたんですね。当時はコミック雑誌の種類も少なかったこともあって、今とは比べ物にならないくらい雑誌がよく売れてたし読まれてたんです。だから本屋にコミックを買いに来るお客さんは、基本的にみんな内容を知ってたんやね。一回読んだやつを買いに来てるわけ。じゃあ、コミックコーナーで立ち読みをしてる人たちはどうかというと、彼らは絶対に買わへんわけですよ。一回読んだやつをまた立ち読みしてるというのは買う意思がないわけなんやから。そうなると、立ち読みしてる人たちは本を汚すだけで本屋にとってお客さんやないから、買う人にとっては邪魔なだけやったんです。そこで読めへんようにしようとしてメーカーさんと一緒に開発したんがシュリンクなんです」
こう語っていたのは97年当時京都七条で伝説的な漫画専門店「BIGBOSS」を経営されていた石田さん。シュリンク創始者の一人です。さくまあきら氏の十年前の日記に奇跡的に写真付で登場していたのがウェブ上に残っていたのでリンクはっておきます。（http://sakumania.com/diary/nikki/971230.html）
このBIGBOSSはすでに閉店して存在していないのですが、私は一度だけ訪問したことがあります。でも私が行ったとき、BIGBOSSでは実はコミックのシュリンクはしてなかったのです。これは何故なんでしょうか？
「 やはり時代が変わりました。もうシュリンクする時代やないと思います。最近のお客さんはコミック雑誌で連載を読んでないんですよ。どれ読んだらええんかわからんくらいいっぱい種類出てるしね。そうなったらね、お客さんはそのマンガ自体を知らないわけですから、店に来て面白いかどうか探して買うしかないんです。立ち読みしとる人たちと言ったら昔は邪魔もんでしかなかったんやけど、今はお客さんかもしれへんわけです。だからシュリンクは外したほうがいい。シュリンクを始めた私が言うんだから間違いないです」
なるほど、シュリンクの創始者は完全にシュリンク否定派になったわけですね。でもそんなことしたら売上さがるんじゃないですか？
「 よく売上さがるんじゃないかと言われるんですが、実際に私は前にいた店で実験したことがあるんですね。結果、シュリンクを外しても売上は変わりませんでした。むしろ若干あがったかあがらんかぐらいの実績でした。ただ、その店ではしばらくシュリンクははずしてたんですが、今は復活してます。売上どうこうというよりね、立ち読み客が増えたことでお客さんのマナーが悪くなってね、メンテナンスもでけへんし、お客さんが安心して買えないような店になってしもたんです」
なるほど。これが1997年当時の現実だったわけですね。この話からわかることを整理してみましょう。まずシュリンクというのは、売上効果云々を考える前に元々は美本を販売するというお客様へのサービスから始まっていたということ。シュリンクをはずしても売上はほとんど変わらないということ。コミックを店舗で購入されるお客様は３種類の客層にわけることができるということです。
３種類の客層というのはこういうグルーピングです。
まずは、シュリンクしてなきゃ嫌だ、というグループですね。このグループをを仮にAとしましょう。Aの方は、コミックの単行本を「モノ」としても評価する傾向が強いので、きれいなモノでないと満足しません。シュリンクをしていない本は誰かが読んだかもしれない＝「キタナイ」と評価を下すグループです。基本的にもう買うタイトルは決まっていて、「目的買い」中心のグループです。
逆にシュリンクをしている本は買わないグループもあります。このグループをBとします。Bの方は、コミックの単行本の「モノ」としての価値にはどちらかといえば無頓着で、中に何が書かれているかという「情報」を重視するタイプです。Bグループの人にとっては、コミック＝「エンタテイメントコンテンツ（情報）」であり、パッケージば美しいかどうかは評価の優先順位として低めです。ちょっと読んでみて面白そうだったら買うという「衝動買い」が中心になります。シュリンクされている本は、読めないので「衝動買い」の対象にならない、ということになります。
最後にCグループの人たちです。Cグループの人たちは、AやBの人のようなコミックに対してのこだわりがそこまで深くない無党派層です。そこの書店がシュリンクしてるから買うとか買わないとかではなく、単に家から近いから買いに来ているだけで、シュリンクの有無のために、わざわざ隣町のお店に買う店を変えるような面倒くさいことはしません。ただし、軽度のAとか軽度のBとかは混じっていて、CからAになる人とかBになる人、のようにABグループの母集団であるという性格ももっています。もちろん、人数としては圧倒的にCグループが多いんです。
これを石田さんの話にあてはめるとこうなります。最初シュリンクをしているとき店の顧客は、A+Cでした。シュリンクをやめると、顧客からAが離れてBが加わりB+Cになります。A+CからB+Cに変わっても売上が変わらなかったということはA=Bだったということですね。で、Aに比べてBのマナーがよくなくて、Cにも影響が出てきた、と言ってるわけです。
私は翌年の98年、このABCの比率を自店でアンケート調査をして調べてみました。A＞Bであれば、シュリンクをやめれば売上が下がってしまいますからね。設問は二つでしたが、驚くべき結果でした。
「 あなたは、きれいな本を購入するために、コミックはビニールパックされているほうがよいですか？」
YES90 ％ 、NO10 % 。
「 中身を読めるようにするために、コミックのビニールパックは無いほうがよいですか？」
YES90 ％ 、NO10％ 。
うわ！全く同じ人に対して聞いているアンケートなのに、シュリンク賛成反対のどっちも90％という結果になってしまいました。両方ともYESという、この一見矛盾している回答が出来てしまうのはCグループの方であると判断すると、Aが10％、Bが10％、Cが80％ということになります。
やはりA=Bでした。実際、この年に私の店を含めて10店舗でおこなわれたシュリンク無し実験は「シュリンクがあるかないかと売上には、相関関係は認められない」という結果に終わったのでした。結論から言うと、90年代後半は、本当に売上がかわらなかったのでした。
しかし、時代は21世紀に移り、劇的な変化を見せるようになっていきます。この「売上が変わらない」という法則が、崩れ始めてきたのです。（つづく）
Six - and 10 - month - old babies are much more capable judges of character than previously thought .
Not only can infants pick out a good Samaritan , they tend to identify with them , according to a Yale University study published in the journal Nature .
The study released last month presented babies with a diorama - like display of an anthropomorphic circle struggling to make it up a hill .
Just when it appeared that all hope was lost , a heroic triangle appeared , and pushed the circle to the top .
The round climber bounces , clearly elated to have reached the summit .
The same scenario is played out again , only this time a square appears at the top of the hill and pushes the circle to the bottom .
The babies were then asked to pick a toy – the helper or the hinderer , as scientists called them .
One hundred percent of 6 - month - olds and 87.5 percent of 10 - month - olds chose the helper .
The results were consistent even when the triangle and the square swapped places as good guy and bad guy .
In several other iterations of the experiment , the helper , regardless of shape or color , won out .
" Babies are very competent socially , " says Kiley Hamlin , lead author of the study .
" They can figure this kind of stuff out without people explicitly teaching what 's nice and not nice and who 's nice and who 's not nice . "
In another component of the study , researchers showed the circle choosing to sit with the helper or the hinderer .
In this instance they found that 10 - month - old babies were far more adept at noticing something seemed strange when the circle decided to sit with the hinderer .
( They figured this out by how long the baby watched the helper or hinderer pair up with the circle , working under the assumption that babies , like adults , study something that appears out of the ordinary . )
While other research has shown that babies make assessments about people based on their physical appearance – they gravitate toward attractive people – these new findings show more complex levels of judgment .
" In any species that needs to cooperate as much as humans do … we always need to know who might be a good cooperator and who might not , " says Ms. Hamlin .
MONDAY UPDATE : * The Sopranos creator David Chase , in France to avoid “ all the Monday morning quarterbacking ” gave an interview about the show ’s ending .
“ I have no interest in explaining , defending , reinterpreting , or adding to what is there , ” he says of the final scene .
“ No one was trying to be audacious , honest to god .
We did what we thought we had to do .
No one was trying to blow people ’s minds , or thinking , ‘ Wow , this ’ll ( tick ) them off . ’
People get the impression that you ’re trying to ( mess ) with them and it ’s not true .
You ’re trying to entertain them . ”
Chase agreed in advance to give one exclusive post - show interview to New Jersey ’s Star - Ledger , which is printing it for Tuesday .
After that , he intends to stay silent .*
SUNDAY PM : The line to cancel HBO starts here .
What a ridiculously disappointing end lacking in creativity and filled with cowardice to The Sopranos saga .
But if you ’re one of those who found it perversely interesting , then do n’t bother to read on .
Even if David Chase , who wrote and directed the final episode , was demonstrating the existential and endless loop of Tony ’s life or the moments before the hit that causes his death , it still robbed the audience of visual closure .
I am well aware of the internet chatter how the last episode all refers back to the first episode , as Chase himself said in an interview .
To me , this is just a new version of listening to vinyl backwards and seeing if the words make sense !
And if it were done to segue into a movie , that crass commercialism should n’t be tolerated .
( MONDAY UPDATE : *I just checked with Chase ’s manager and Sopranos ‘ executive producer Brad Grey , who tells me that Chase is living in France and “ just taking time off .
There is absolutely no discussion of the movie . ” *)
There ’s even buzz that the real ending will only be available on the series ’ final DVD .
Either way , it was terrible .
Apparently , my extreme reaction was typical of many series ’ fans : they crashed HBO ’s website for a time tonight trying to register their outrage .
HBO could suffer a wave of cancellations as a result .
( Already , the pay channel ’s replacement series like John from Cincinnati are getting panned . )
Chase clearly did n’t give a damn about his fans .
Instead , he crapped in their faces .
This is why America hates Hollywood .
Unlike some network series that end abruptly because broadcasters pull the plug without warning , The Sopranos has been slated for years to go off the air tonight .
But instead of carefully crafted , this finale looked like it had been concocted in a day or two .
( Some of the scenes were cut so abruptly , they caused whiplash . )
Let ’s not forget that , in later years , Chase had to be dragged kicking and screaming back to the computer to write more episodes against his will even though The Sopranos made him rich beyond what ’s reasonable .
Especially now that it ’s in syndication .
( See my A&E ’s Profanity - Free Tony Soprano A Hit . )
Also , Chase enjoyed manipulating audiences by leaving loose ends .
Everyone remembers that famous episode where the Russian escapes in the woods only never to be heard from again ( “ The Pine Barrens ” ) .
Recently the actor who plays Paulie Walnuts revealed that a script contained a scene in which the Russian reappeared this year .
“ But when we went to shoot it , they took it out .
I think David did n’t like it .
He wanted the audience just to suffer , ” the thesp said .
In this final episode , Chase needed to exert himself to a concoct an artful denouement .
But he took the lazy way out .
Are n’t writers paid to write ?
The show we all loved deserved a decent burial .
Instead , it went into a black hole .
Already , some top TV critics are claiming that Chase fulfilled expectations by defying expectations .
And the blogosphere is busy dissecting every final moment , with some wanting to see profundity in the screen going black because of Tony ’s beginning of the season conversation with Bobby — you would n’t even know it had happened : everything would just go black .
Or making a game of the many foreshadowing moments — the jukebox song below “ Do n’t Stop Believing ” was “ Any Way You Want It ” .
Or connecting dots inside the restaurant that the guy at the bar is supposed to be Phil ’s nephew Nikki Leotardo from Season 6 , and the trucker in the hat in the booth was the brother of the guy who was robbed by Christopher in Season 2 , and the boy scouts were in the train store when Bobby got shot last week , and so on .
The Nielsen reality is that people do n’t watch TV anywhere near that closely anymore , much less remember what goes on from week to week , to give such a subtle ending its proper due .
Besides ,
The Sopranos was not a show that went on inside your head .
It was a richly visual series whose most memorable moments were graphic and in your face and damn proud of it .
Like Tony , it was defiant .
This was whimpering .
If you ’re angry at wasting an hour , complain with your wallets .
Có vai trò như “ yết hầu ” của ngôi nhà và cũng là nơi bắt buộc khi đi qua khi vào nhà , nếu bố trí khu vực này chính xác , hợp lý sẽ giúp hoá giải sát khí cho ngôi nhà của bạn .

Pity the poor Costa Rican postman .
Sure , he does n’t have to deal with sleet or snow .
But consider what passes for an address here :
From the Tibas cemetery , 200 meters south , 300 meters west , cross the train tracks , white two - story house .
That ’s actually a pretty easy one .
Making his rounds on the outskirts of this capital city one recent morning , carrier Roberto Montero Reyes pulled envelopes from his canvas sack whose addresses read like treasure - hunt clues or lines of haiku .
There was one for someone who lived on “ the south side of the Red Cross ” and another for a family whose home is “ 125 meters [ 410 feet ] west of the Pizza Hut . ”
Advertisement
“ You ’ve got to be a mind reader , . . . a historian and a detective ” to do this job , said Montero , a 27 - year veteran , who walks his route in camouflage - print sneakers .
It may be difficult for GPS addicts to comprehend , but Costa Rica does n’t have a standardized system of addresses -- at least not ones that can be typed into MapQuest .
Many streets are n’t named , and virtually none have signs .
Many houses do n’t have numbers .
Only a few pockets of the country use anything close to the “ 123 Main St. ” format that Americans would recognize .
Instead , most Costa Rican addresses are expressed in relation to the closest community landmark .
In colonial times , that was the church or town hall .
Today it could be a fast - food joint or car dealership .
For some , the quirky system is a reassuring link to their country ’s agrarian past , a colorful affirmation of what it means to be “ Tico , ” or Costa Rican .
Almost everyone beams when they talk about the “ old fig tree ” and the “ old Coca - Cola plant . ”
Both of those San Jose - area landmarks have been lost to history , but locals still cite them when giving directions as if they still existed .
For a disoriented visitor , it ’s proof that magical realism is alive and well in Latin America .
Advertisement
“ It ’s part of the idiosyncrasy of Costa Ricans , ” said historian Francisco Maroto Mejia , director of the postal museum for Correos de Costa Rica , the nation ’s postal service .
The trouble is that these rustic addresses are n’t keeping pace with Costa Rica ’s development .
A nation of more than 4 million , Costa Rica boasts the highest standard of living in Central America and has a vibrant technology sector .
But until recently it took an average of nine days to deliver a letter -- if it got there at all .
Postal authorities say that 1 in 5 pieces of mail is undeliverable because they can’t figure out where the addressee lives .
The problem is worse in new subdivisions , where neighbors do n’t know one another and ca n’t advise carriers .
Mail is just one problem .
Emergency crews , cabdrivers , utility workers and delivery people spend an inordinate amount of time on cellphones and knocking on doors to find out where they ’re supposed to be .
“ It ’s total chaos , ” said San Jose - area retiree Claudio Gonzalez , 73 , who recently spent three fruitless hours searching for a friend ’s home in an unfamiliar suburb .
“ I could find my way easier in a foreign country . ”
Advertisement
Postal authorities have embarked on a major overhaul .
Recent changes in the way mail is sorted have cut the average delivery time to two days nationwide .
Now the postal service is assigning numbers , street names and ZIP Codes to every home and building in the country , which at about 20,000 square miles is slightly smaller than San Bernardino County .
Officials have rolled out more than 430,000 streamlined addresses , mostly in urban areas .
They hope to convert the entire country over the next two years if the government allocates about $ 1 million to finish the job .
Erecting street signs will take a lot longer and cost a bundle .
Correos de Costa Rica is trying to persuade the private sector to help pay for that effort .
But the biggest challenge will be altering the Tico mind - set , said Alvaro Coghi Gomez , the postmaster general .
“ It ’s a cultural process , ” Coghi said .
“ We have to stop thinking about the fig tree . ”
Advertisement
Costa Rica is n’t the only nation with an address system potentially befuddling to outsiders .
Neighboring Nicaragua uses the same landmark system , with a few added wrinkles .
Residents often write arriba , or “ up , ” to denote east ( where the sun rises ) , and abajo , “ down , ” for west ( where it sets ) .
Instead of meters , they use city blocks , or varas , an antiquated Spanish unit of measurement equivalent to about 33 inches .
Costa Rican carrier Montero has his hands full at home .
A third - generation postal worker , he joined the ranks because it was respectable work and he liked the benefits , which include company - paid pants , shirts and shoes .
Advertisement
He begins his day at 6:30 a.m. sorting mail at Correo Central , the grand if slightly scruffy downtown San Jose post office constructed in 1917 .
Workers handle the mail now much the way they did back then .
Every one of the 28 million letters and packages mailed last year had to be sorted by hand .
Modern equipment is n’t capable of reading the addresses .
Some of the nation ’s 330 carriers make their rounds by car , motorcycle or bicycle .
Montero prefers to walk .
After collecting his mail , he rides a public bus 15 minutes to the start of his 4 - mile route in San Jose ’s northern suburb of Tibas .
His first stops are small businesses along a busy commercial strip .
These are a snap because their signs speak for themselves .
Neighborhoods are trickier .
Many residents appear to be logistically challenged and colorblind to boot .
Homes whose addresses state they are 100 meters , or 328 feet , from a landmark might be half that or double that .
Homeowners who repaint rarely bother to change the descriptions in the addresses they ’ve filed with banks , utilities and retailers .
Advertisement
Montero showed a letter for someone who supposedly lives 164 feet south of a beauty salon .
The home is actually north of the shop .
“ People do n’t even know where they live , ” he said with good - natured exasperation .
The guy whose house is “ next to the Miranda Furniture Store ” got lucky .
Montero , 59 , knew that the property changed hands years ago and now houses an appliance retailer with a different name .
Most homes on Montero ’s route do n’t even have mailboxes , but he does n’t take offense .
He always knocks on the door or rings the bell before he slides a letter through the ubiquitous security fences .
If he ca n’t find an address , he collars neighbors and quizzes business owners .
Advertisement
“ Someone might be waiting ” for that letter , he said , turning serious for just a moment .
He acknowledges that adapting to a new system wo n’t be easy after all these years .
But the changes can’t come soon enough for one of his customers , 80 - year - old Yolanda Cerdas .
She scoffs at the notion that there is anything poetic or sentimental about needless disorder .
“ How can a tree be an address ? ” Cerdas said .
“ Bad habits .
That ’s our problem . ”

Learn the Perl / Tk module , Part 1
The basics of Perl / Tk
Content series :
This content is part # of # in the series : Learn the Perl / Tk module , Part 1 Stay tuned for additional content in this series .
This content is part of the series : Learn the Perl / Tk module , Part 1 Stay tuned for additional content in this series .
The Perl language is usually used by IBM ® AIX ® operating system administrators and developers , and it can be found on nearly every successful Web site and most AIX systems .
Although Perl scripts are powerful , they produce a Web interface that lacks a graphical front end , and the user has to type information instead of using the mouse , which can be an unsatisfying experience for the customer .
This problem has been resolved with the introduction to the Tk module in Perl .
An administrator or developer can quickly breathe new life into their Perl script with the Tk module and satisfy their customer 's desire for an X11 product .
What is Perl ?
Perl , or Practical Extraction and Reporting Languages , was created by Larry Wall in 1987 as a means to simplify his programming work .
Since its conception , Perl has evolved into a globally used language and is a staple for most administrators and developers .
What is the Perl / Tk module ?
The Perl / Tk module , also known as pTk or ptk , is a Perl module designed to create widgets and other commonly used graphical objects to form a graphical user interface ( GUI ) .
Using the module to create a GUI enhances the look and feel of a program and helps the end user navigate through the program and its functions .
One major advantage of using the Perl / Tk module is that the resulting application can be cross-platform , meaning the same GUI application can be used on UNIX® , Linux® , Macintosh , Microsoft ® Windows ® , or any other operating system that has Perl and the Perl / Tk module installed .
Where to get the Perl / Tk module
Before you write an application with the Perl / Tk module , you must verify that Perl and the Perl / Tk module are installed .
Although Perl is commonly installed on computers , the Perl / Tk module is n't .
One way to verify if Perl is installed is to type perl -- version at the command line .
If Perl is n't installed , please refer to the installation guide found on Perl 's Web site ( see Related topics ) .
Once you 've located or installed Perl on your computer , the next step is to determine whether the Perl / Tk module needs to be installed .
A simple way to verify if a module is installed is to type perl -e " use module " at the command prompt .
To verify if the Perl / Tk module is installed , execute the following command :
perl -e " use Tk "
If the module is found , the command executes and returns to a command prompt .
However , if the module is n't found , an error message similar to the following is displayed :
Ca n't locate Tk.pm in @INC ( @INC contains : /opt/ActivePerl-5.8/site/lib /opt/ActivePerl-5.8/lib . ) at -e line 1 . BEGIN failed -- compilation aborted at -e line 1 .
Keep in mind that Perl is case sensitive : perl –e " use Tk " and perl –e " use tk " are two different statements trying to use two different modules ( Tk and tk ) .
If the module is n't found , the next step is to download and install it .
You can do so a couple of ways .
If you 're using UNIX or Linux , one way to download and install Perl modules is to use the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network ( CPAN ) .
Type the following at the command prompt :
perl –MCPAN –e shell install Bundle : : CPAN reload cpan install Tk
If you 're using Windows , a similar approach is to use Perl Package Manager ( PPM ) .
At a command prompt , type ppm to start the GUI and download the Tk module .
Once the installation is complete , reverify that Perl can find the module by executing perl –e " use Tk " .
Create a window
Now that the computer has Perl and the Perl / Tk module installed , it 's time to write your first GUI program through the module .
You 'll start with a simple Hello World program .
With your preferred text editor , create a file named helloworld.pl , and enter the following text in the file :
#!/usr/bin/perl -w # Display Hello
World program use Tk ; use strict ; my $ mw = MainWindow - > new ; $ mw -> geometry ( " 200x100 " ) ; $ mw -> title ( " Hello World ! !! " ) ; $ mw -> Label ( - text => ' Hello World ' ) -> pack ( ) ; $ mw -> Button ( - text => " Close " , - command =>sub{exit} ) -> pack ( ) ; MainLoop ;
Executing this script generates the GUI application , as shown in Figure 1 below .
Figure 1 . Hello World example
Let 's break this script down , line by line :
#!/usr/bin/perl -w
The first part ( /usr / bin / perl ) defines the location where the Perl executable resides on the computer and instructs the computer to use this copy of the Perl executable to execute the helloworld .
pl file .
The second part of this line ( - w ) is a valuable tool in Perl :
It enables warnings when executing the script , informing the end user of any possible errors found .
Comments and text that should n't be evaluated at execution are preceded with an octothorpe or # symbol :
# Display Hello World program
In order for a Perl script to use the Tk module , it must be included — in other words , use Tk .
Adding the use strict statement to a Perl script also helps find any possible typos or logic errors :
use Tk ; use strict ;
To create the primary window of the application , use MainWindow and assign it to $ mw .
$ mw acts as the parent to all other widgets :
my $ mw = MainWindow - > new ;
Set the main window size to 200 x 100 and title the window " Hello World ! ! ! : "
$ mw -> geometry ( " 200x100 " ) ; $ mw -> title ( " Hello World ! ! ! " ) ;
Create a label inside the main window with the caption Hello World .
At the end of the label creation is an additional function , pack , which is the geometry manager .
It 's used on widgets to calculate the space allocated on the widget 's parent ; it also displays the widget :
$ mw -> Label ( - text => ' Hello World ' ) -> pack ( ) ;
This line creates a Close button inside the main window .
When activated by a mouse click or executed by the keyboard , this button exits the Perl script :
$ mw -> Button ( - text => " Close " , - command =>sub{exit} ) -> pack ( ) ;
Again , because this button takes up space on the main window , you need to use the pack function to calculate the space used .
Prior to executing MainLoop , everything in the script is read , defined , and prepared to execute .
Then , when MainLoop is called , all functions and data read prior to that point are executed , and the GUI is displayed .
MainLoop ;
Widgets
This section introduces widgets .
It covers a few basic widgets and presents examples of each , including frames , text , entry , buttons , and labels .
What is a widget ?
A widget is a graphical object that performs a specific function .
Any graphical object in the Perl / Tk module can be considered a widget .
When you think of a GUI application , the buttons , text , frames , and scrollbars are all widgets .
The following widget examples build a base for widgets discussed later in this article .
Frame
The frame widget is exactly what it 's named : a frame or box .
The frame is used to group other widgets .
Enter the following script :
#!/usr/bin/perl -w use
Tk ; use strict ; my $ mw = MainWindow - > new ; $ mw -> geometry ( " 200x100 " ) ; $ mw - > title ( " Frame Test " ) ; $ mw -> Frame ( - background => ' red ' ) -> pack( - ipadx => 50 , - side => " left " , - fill => " y " ) ; $ mw -> Frame ( - background => ' blue ' ) -> pack( - ipadx => 50 , - side => " right " , - fill => " y " ) ; MainLoop ;
When you execute this script , it generates the GUI application , as shown in Figure 2 .
Figure 2 . Frame widget example
Let 's break down the script :
#!/usr/bin/perl -w use
Tk ; use strict ; my $ mw = MainWindow - > new ; $ mw -> geometry ( " 200x100 " ) ; $ mw - > title ( " Frame Test " ) ; … … MainLoop ;
This portion was discussed in the previous example , so let 's move on to the new statements .
Create a frame with the main window as the parent , and set the background color to red .
Unlike previous examples of the pack method , a few options are included :
$ mw -> Frame ( - background => ' red ' ) -> pack( - ipadx => 50 , - side => " left " , - fill = > " y " ) ;
The first argument , ipadx , increases the frame 's width by 100 ( 50 x 2 ) .
The second argument , side , adjusts the geometric position of the frame to the left side of its parent ( $ mw ) .
The third argument allocates space in the frame in the direction of y ( vertically ) .
This frame is similar to the previous frame , but the background is blue , and the position is on the right side of the main window :
$ mw -> Frame ( - background => ' blue ' ) -> pack ( - ipadx => 50 , - side => " right " , - fill = > " y " ) ;
Text
The text widget creates an editable text workspace .
Enter the following script :
#!/usr/bin/perl -w use
Tk ; use strict ; my $ mw = MainWindow - > new ; $ mw -> geometry ( " 200x100 " ) ; $ mw - > title ( " Text Test " ) ; $ mw -> Text ( - background => ' cyan ' , - foreground => ' white ' ) -> pack ( - side => " top " ) ; MainLoop ;
Executing the script and typing in the window generates the GUI application , as shown in Figure 3 .
Figure 3 .
Text widget example
In this example , the text widget is created with the main window as the parent :
$ mw -> Text ( - background => ' cyan ' , - foreground => ' white ' ) -> pack ( - side => " top " ) ;
Rather than changing only the background color , the foreground font color is changed as well .
As always , the pack method is used to allocate space and display the widget .
Entry
The entry widget is similar to the text widget in that you can edit or enter text in the widget .
The text widget lets you enter multiple lines of text , and the entry widget allows only a single line of text .
Enter the following script :
#!/usr/bin/perl -w use
Tk ; use strict ; my $ mw = MainWindow - > new ; $ mw -> geometry ( " 200x100 " ) ; $ mw - > title ( " Entry Test " ) ; $ mw -> Entry ( - background => ' black ' , - foreground => ' white ' ) -> pack ( - side => " top " ) ; MainLoop ;
Executing the script and typing in the window generates the GUI application , as shown in Figure 4 .
Figure 4 . Entry widget example
The only difference between the text widget and this one is the widget name :
$ mw -> Entry ( - background => ' black ' , - foreground => ' white ' ) -> pack ( - side => " top " ) ;
However , as the example shows , you can supply only one line of text .
Button
The button widget creates a button that can execute functions or commands when activated by the end user .
Nearly all graphical programs include buttons , so it 's handy to be familiar with the button widget .
The following example uses three buttons .
The first , labeled Button 1 , displays the message Button 1 pushed with an OK button .
The second button , labeled Button 2 , displays the message Button 2 pushed with both Yes and No buttons asking whether the user wants to exit the program .
Depending on which button is clicked , a new message is displayed stating that either the Yes or No button was clicked and the program does or does n't exit .
Here 's the example script :
#!/usr/bin/perl -w use
Tk ; use strict ; my $ mw = MainWindow - > new ; $ mw -> geometry ( " 200x100 " ) ; $ mw -> title ( " Button Test " ) ; my $ button1 = $ mw -> Button ( - text => " Button # 1 " , - command => \&button1_sub ) -> pack ( ) ; my $ button2 = $ mw -> Button ( - text => " Button # 2 " , - command => \&button2_sub ) -> pack ( ) ; sub button1_sub { $ mw->messageBox ( - message => " Button 1 Pushed " , - type => " ok " ) ; } sub button2_sub { my $ yesno_button = $ mw->messageBox ( - message =>
" Button 2 Pushed .
Exit ? " , - type => " yesno " , - icon => " question " ) ; $ mw->messageBox ( - message =>
" You pressed $ yesno_button ! " , - type => " ok " ) ; if ( $yesno_button eq " Yes " ) { $ mw->messageBox ( - message =>
" Ok , Exiting . " , - type => " ok " ) ; exit ; } else { $ mw->messageBox ( - message =>
" I did n't think so either . " , - type => " ok " ) ; } } MainLoop ;
Executing the script generates the GUI application , as shown in Figures 5 through 11 .

Confirmation of Yes button clicked
This script is more complicated than the previous examples but , if you break it down , it 's as easy to follow as the others .
First , you create each button and assign the appropriate text to it ( Button # 1 or Button # 2 ) .
Each button is linked to a command or function .
The subroutines are appropriately called button1_sub and button2_sub :
my $ button1 = $ mw -> Button ( - text => " Button # 1 " , - command => \&button1_sub ) -> pack ( ) ; my $ button2 = $ mw -> Button ( - text => " Button # 2 " , - command => \&button2_sub ) -> pack ( ) ;
When $ button1 is clicked , the subroutine button1_sub is executed .
Inside this function , a message box is created that displays the text Button 1 Pushed with a single button labeled OK .
Because no further evaluations are performed on the OK button , the message box is destroyed and the main window regains focus .
sub button1_sub { $ mw->messageBox ( - message => " Button 1 Pushed " , - type => " ok " ) ; }
This subroutine is similar to the first except that it includes two buttons labeled Yes and No .
Once the user clicks a button , a new message box appears that states which one they clicked .
Then , another message box is displayed that states whether the program is exiting :
sub button2_sub { my $ yesno_button = $ mw->messageBox ( - message =>
" Button 2 Pushed .
Exit ? " , - type => " yesno " , - icon => " question " ) ; $ mw->messageBox ( - message =>
" You pressed $ yesno_button ! " , - type => " ok " ) ; if ( $yesno_button eq " Yes " ) { $ mw->messageBox ( - message =>
" Ok , Exiting . " , - type => " ok " ) ; exit ; } else { $ mw->messageBox ( - message =>
" I did n't think so either . " , - type => " ok " ) ; } }
Label
A label is a non-editable text widget .
Labels can be useful prior to text boxes and entry boxes .
Enter the following example script :
#!/usr/bin/perl -w use
Tk ; use strict ; my $ mw = MainWindow - > new ; $ mw -> geometry ( " 200x100 " ) ; $ mw - > title ( " Entry Test " ) ; $ mw -> Label ( - text => " What 's your name ? " ) -> pack ( - side => " left " ) ; $ mw -> Entry ( - background => ' black ' , - foreground => ' white ' ) -> pack ( - side => " right " ) ; MainLoop ;
Executing this script generates the GUI application , as shown in Figure 12 .
Figure 12 .
Label widget example
The first line creates the label with the text What 's your name ? :
$ mw -> Label ( - text => " What 's your name ? " ) -> pack ( - side => " left " ) ; $ mw -> Entry ( - background => ' black ' , - foreground => ' white ' ) -> pack ( - side => " right " ) ;
To position the label to the left of the entry widget , you set pack to align to the left side .
As in previous examples , an entry widget is created with a black background and white background .
To position the entry to the right of the label widget , set pack to align to the right side .
Putting it all together
Now that you 're familiar with a few widgets , let 's put it all together in one script :
#!/usr/bin/perl -w use
Tk ; use strict ; my $ mw = MainWindow - > new ; $ mw -> geometry ( " 500x200 " ) ; $ mw - > title ( " All - In - One Test " ) ; my $ main_frame = $ mw -> Frame ( ) -> pack ( - side => ' top ' , - fill => ' x ' ) ; my $ top_frame = $ main_frame -> Frame ( - background => " red " ) -> pack ( - side => ' top ' , - fill => ' x ' ) ; my $ left_frame = $ main_frame -> Frame ( - background => " black " ) -> pack ( - side => ' left ' , - fill => 'y ' ) ; my $ right_frame = $ main_frame -> Frame ( - background => " white " ) -> pack ( - side => " right " ) ; $ top_frame -> Label ( - text => " All - In - One Test ! " , - background => " red " ) -> pack ( - side => " top " ) ; $ left_frame -> Label ( - text =>
" Enter text to copy " , - background => " black " , - foreground => " yellow " ) -> pack ( - side => " left " ) ; my $ copy_entry = $ left_frame ->
Entry ( - background => " white " , - foreground => " red " ) -> pack ( - side => " left " ) ; my $ copy_button = $ left_frame -> Button ( - text => " Copy Text " , - command => \©_entry ) -> pack ( - side => " right " ) ; my $ clear_text = $ right_frame -> Button ( - text => " Clear Text " , - command => \&clear_entry ) -> pack ( - side => " top " ) ; my $ paste_text = $ right_frame -> Text ( - background => " white " , - foreground => " black " ) -> pack ( - side => " top " ) ; sub clear_entry { $ paste_text - > delete ( ' 0.0 ' , ' end ' ) ; } sub copy_entry { my $ copied_text = $ copy_entry - > get ( ) ; $ paste_text -> insert ( " end " , $ copied_text ) ; } MainLoop ;
Executing this script generates the GUI application , as shown in Figure 13 .
Figure 13 .
All - in - one example
Let 's break it down like the other examples .
First , you build a main frame and three frames inside it .
These frames contain the other widgets and keep everything organized :
my $ main_frame = $ mw -> Frame ( ) -> pack ( - side => ' top ' , - fill => ' x ' ) ; my $ top_frame = $ main_frame -> Frame ( - background => " red " ) -> pack ( - side => ' top ' , - fill => ' x ' ) ; my $ left_frame = $ main_frame -> Frame ( - background => " black " ) -> pack ( - side => ' left ' , - fill => 'y ' ) ; my $ right_frame = $ main_frame -> Frame ( - background => " white " ) -> pack ( - side => " right " ) ;
Next , you add the labels : one in the top frame and another in the left frame :
$ top_frame -> Label ( - text => " All - In - One Test ! " , - background => " red " ) -> pack ( - side => " top " ) ; $ left_frame -> Label ( - text =>
" Enter text to copy " , - background => " black " , - foreground => " yellow " ) -> pack ( - side => " left " ) ;
To accompany the label in the left frame , create an entry widget so that the user can type the text that they want copied .
You also use a button widget to perform the copy function to copy the text to the right frame 's text widget :
my $ copy_entry = $ left_frame -> Entry ( - background => " white " , - foreground => " red " ) -> pack ( - side => " left " ) ; my $ copy_button = $ left_frame -> Button ( - text => " Copy Text " , - command => \©_entry ) -> pack ( - side => " right " ) ;
Now let 's look at the right frame .
A button widget lets the user clear all text from the text widget :
my $ clear_text = $ right_frame -> Button ( - text => " Clear Text " , - command => \&clear_entry ) -> pack ( - side => " top " ) ; my $ paste_text = $ right_frame -> Text ( - background => " white " , - foreground => " black " ) -> pack ( - side => " top " ) ;
You also create a text widget so that the user can copy text from the entry widget and edit it if necessary .
These functions are the clear and copy subroutines :
sub clear_entry { $ paste_text -> delete ( ' 0.0 ' , ' end ' ) ; } sub copy_entry { my $ copied_text = $ copy_entry - > get ( ) ; $ paste_text -> insert ( " end " , $ copied_text ) ; }
The clear_entry function deletes all text starting from 0.0 , or line 0 character 0 , up to and including the end of the widget .
The copy_entry function gets the text in the entry widget and inserts it into the text widget .
Conclusion
Introducing Perl with the Perl / Tk module into an AIX environment can benefit the developer , administrator , and customer or end user .
You can enhance a script that might look dull to the customer into a professional - looking GUI application .
It might take you a little while to get the hang of the widgets but , once you 've mastered them , the results are worth the effort and time !

The Cell chip has several processing cores to do number crunching
Security researcher Nick Breese used a PS3 to crack supposedly strong eight - character passwords in hours .
Typically , previous attempts to crack such passwords took days to get the same result .
Eight - character passwords are used to protect PDF and Zip files as well as those produced by Microsoft Office .
The work to turn the PS3 into a password cracker was carried out by Nick Breese , who works for Auckland - based Security Assessment .
The Cell processor at the heart of the PS3 is the key to speeding up the time it takes to crack a password .
In a presentation given at the Kiwicon security conference in mid-November , Mr Breese said a powerful Intel chip could crank through 10 - 15 million cycles per second .
The architecture of the Cell processor meant it could speed through 1.4 billion cycles per second .
This speed boost was possible because each Cell chip had several processing cores - each one of which could be effectively trying passwords at the same time .
This was important when attempting " brute force " attacks that go through all possible combinations for a password .
Speaking to the Sydney Morning Herald , Mr Breese said although the PS3 could be used to crack eight - character passwords featuring letters and numbers , stronger encryption systems - such as those used to safeguard web transactions - remained safe .
Mr Breese 's research comes soon after work by Russian company Elcomsoft to use graphics cards to speed up password cracking .
To the untrained eye , the tiny , misshapen , fatty blobs on Giovanni Murtas 's microscope slide would not look very impressive .
But when the Italian scientist saw their telltale green fluorescent glint he knew he had achieved something remarkable - and taken a vital step towards building a living organism from scratch .
The green glow was proof that his fragile creations were capable of making their own proteins , a crucial ability of all living things and vital for carrying out all other aspects of life .
Though only a first step , the discovery will hasten efforts by scientists to build the world 's first synthetic organism .
It could also prove a significant development in the multibillion - dollar battle to exploit the technology for manufacturing commercially valuable chemicals such as drugs and biofuels or cleaning up pollution .
The achievement is a major advance for the new field of " synthetic biology " .
Its proponents hope to construct simple bespoke organisms with carefully chosen components .
But some campaigners worry about the new technology 's unsettling potential and argue there should be a moratorium on the research until the ethical and technological implications have been discussed more widely .
One of the field 's leading lights is the controversial scientist Craig Venter , a beach bum turned scientific entrepreneur who is better known for sequencing the human genome and scouring the oceans for unknown genes on his luxury research yacht .
The research institute he founded hopes to create an artificial " minimal organism " .
And he believes there is big money at stake .
In an interview with Newsweek magazine earlier this year , Dr Venter claimed that a fuel - producing microbe could become the first billion - or trillion - dollar organism .
The institute has already patented a set of genes for creating such a stripped - down creature .
Ultimately , synthetic biologists hope to create the most efficient form of life possible , with the fewest genes needed to allow the organism to grow , replicate and proliferate .
But researchers have approached the problem from two radically different directions .
Dr Venter 's team is starting with one of the simplest forms of cellular life known to science - the bacterium Mycoplasma genitalium , which causes urinary tract infections .
By stripping out each of its 482 genes and observing the effect on the organism they have calculated that a core of 381 are vital for life .
In contrast to this top - down approach , Dr Murtas , at the Enrico Fermi research centre at Roma Tre University in Italy , and Pier Luigi Luisi aim to build a living thing from the bottom up .
" The bottom - up approach has the possibility of creating living systems from entirely non-living materials , " said Tom Knight , an expert in synthetic biology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
" That 's the real power of synthetic biology ...
If you can take it apart into little bits and pieces and shuffle things around and put it back together and it still works , you can have much more confidence that you really understand what is going on . "
The Italian team 's advance is to make simple cells which are essentially bags made up of a fatty membrane containing just 36 enzymes and purified ribosomes - microscopic components common to all cells which translate the genetic code into protein .
The primitive cells are capable of manufacturing protein from one gene .
The team chose a fluorescent green protein found in jellyfish because it was easy to see , using a microscope , when the protein is being made .
" We are trying to minimise any system we put in place for the cell , " said Dr Murtas .
" We can prove at this point that we can have protein synthesis with a minimum set of enzymes - 36 at the moment . "
He hopes the project will teach him about the earliest stirrings of life in Earth 's primeval slime some 3.5 bn years ago .
" It 's impressive work , " said Prof Knight .
" Protein synthesis is a wonderful place to start , partly because it is so well understood and ... you can figure out what is going wrong relatively easily .
But there is a lot more involved in making cells that are alive ...
I think the bottom - up people have a long way to go . "
Dr Murtas acknowledges that his bags of enzymes are a long way from a fully functioning cell , but it is an important proof of principle - being able to make proteins is key for the cell to acquire new functions .
Giving it the ability to grow , divide , partition components into daughter cells correctly and replicate DNA will be a major challenge , though .
The team will report the work in the journal Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications .
Dr Murtas is now working on making cells which are capable of division - crucial if they are to be truly alive .
As the membrane grows , the team hope it will reach a point where the cell becomes too big and so gives rise to a pair of daughter cells .
In June , Dr Venter 's research team announced that they had discovered how to carry out a " genome transplant " .
They showed they could move the genetic recipe of one species of Mycoplasma bacterium into another closely related species .
A report from the Royal Bank of Scotland notes that according to data from April 2007 , production of crude oil in the UK has declined 12 % during the previous 12 months .
The year - on - year decline in oil and gas production in the North Sea continued through April despite near - record investment in 2006 .
In addition , month - to - month production also fell well ahead of summer maintenance .
These numbers conceal , however , a steady increase in gas production since August of last year .
Recent production data provide mounting evidence that the long - term decline of the North Sea will not come to a halt .
The UKCS [ UK Continental Shelf ] is maturing rapidly and an increasing share of investment spending is needed just to maintain current production levels .
The UKCS , located in the North Sea off the eastern coast of the UK , contains the bulk of the country ’s oil reserves , according to the US DOE Energy Information Administration .
The UK also has sizable reserves in the North Sea north of the Shetland Islands , with smaller amounts in the North Atlantic .
The UK also has the Wytch Farm field , the largest onshore oil field in Europe .
I wish I could have taken credit for writing an article I just read :
The presidential primary scam :
Why the game is rigged , and why true democracy is only a secondary factor in the nation ’s rush to nominate the next president .
The author is Michael Scherer .
Here a taste of the article :
The whole stinking process was designed by dead men in smoky parlors and refined by faceless bureaucrats in hotel conference rooms .
It is a nasty brew born of those caldrons of self - interest known as political parties .
At every stage , advantage is parceled out like so much magic potion .
. . .
This election cycle , a top Democratic candidate shaking someone ’s hand in Miami before the end of January is breaking the rules , unless that someone is handing the candidate a check at the same time .
To put it another way , Democrats ’ communicating with voters has been barred in Florida , but taking money from voters is OK .
To put it a third way , the system is not only irrational but offensive to the nation ’s most basic values .
“ The only way that you can hear a candidate campaign is if you are willing to pay a campaign contribution , ” explains Steven Geller , Florida ’s exasperated state Senate Democratic leader .
“ It is astounding . ”
They do n’t teach all of this in school , because even a fourth - grader would get up from his desk and walk out of the classroom in protest .
The devil is in the details and this article provides plenty of details .
Here a meta-aside .
Have you ever seen a parent dealing with an obstreperous three - year old ?
A time - tested parent trick is to offer the child trivial choices , making the child believe that she is empowered with regard to the endeavor ( “ Would you like to clean your room before lunch or after lunch ? ” ) .
The trick is that the choices function as distractions , whereas the basic outcome is fixed from the get go .
It ’s the same thing with voting .
By the time Election Day rolls around , all of the deal - making has already occurred , much of it according to Byzantine political party procedures detailed by this article .
By the way , political parties are not even mentioned in the U.S. Constitution .
Good luck voting for a candidate who does n’t ally himself with a political party .
The bottom line is that you get to vote for this corporate money corrupted candidate or that corporate money corrupted candidate .
It ’s your choice !
That is the essence of the “ freedom ” to vote , that you have a choice that is not much of a choice at all .
Why is n’t it a wide open field ?
Because the whole process is corrupted by money ( And see here and here ) .
And because most highly qualified people want nothing to do with politics .
And because even good people can be swift - boated into ignominy .
I recently disparaged the belief in free will .
The faux vote is a good example of how things feel wide open free when they are anything but ( I can vote for this candidate or that one or I can throw away my vote on a write - in candidate ) .
The political system treats adult voters like three - year - olds .
Peer - to - peer ( P2P ) poisoning company MediaDefender suffered an embarrassing leak this weekend , when almost 700 MB of internal company e-mail was distributed on the Internet via BitTorrent .
The e-mails reveal many aspects of MediaDefender 's elaborate P2P disruption strategies , illuminate previously undisclosed details about the MiiVi scandal , and bring to light details regarding MediaDefender 's collaboration with the New York Attorney General 's office on a secret law enforcement project .
We have been reviewing the data for days and will have multiple reports on the topic .
MediaDefender specializes in file - sharing mitigation — practices that disrupt and deter infringing uses of P2P file - sharing networks .
Music labels and movie studios pay the company millions of dollars to temporarily impede the propagation of new releases in order to compel consumers to pursue legitimate commercial distribution channels .
MediaDefender accomplishes this task by using its array of 2,000 servers and a 9GBps dedicated connection to propagate fake files and launch denial of service attacks against distributors .
The e-mail was leaked to the public by a group that calls itself MediaDefender - Defenders .
In a text file distributed with the mail , the group explains how the e-mails were obtained and why they are being distributed .
Apparently , MediaDefender employee Jay Mairs forwarded all of his company e-mails to a Gmail account , which was eventually infiltrated .
" By releasing these e-mails we hope to secure the privacy and personal integrity of all peer - to - peer users , " writes the group behind the disclosure .
" So here it is ; we hope this is enough to create a viable defense to the tactics used by these companies . "
It 's not surprising that MediaDefender was targeted in this manner .
The company was accused of using shady tactics earlier this year when BitTorrent community site TorrentFreak revealed that the anti-piracy company was surreptitiously operating a video upload service called MiiVi that offered high speed downloads of copyright - protected content .
Critics accused MediaDefender of using the site to perpetrate an entrapment scheme , an allegation that the company has vigorously denied .
MediaDefender founder Randy Saaf personally assured Ars that MiiVi was an internal project that was never intended for public use .
Back in July when we covered the MiiVi scandal , we knew Saaf 's story did n't quite add up , and now the general public has evidence that blows holes in Saaf 's claims .
The MediaDefender e-mails leaked this weekend confirm beyond doubt that the company intentionally attempted to draw traffic to MiiVi while obscuring its own affiliation with the site .
The e-mails also show that MediaDefender immediately began to recreate the site under a different name and corporate identity soon after the original plan was exposed .
The rise of MiiVi
Shortly after the public launch of MiiVi in June , developer Ben Grodsky e-mailed Saaf and his colleagues to inform them that the site was beginning to receive traffic .
" We have some success !
12 people have signed up on [ the ] page .
7 have installed [ the ] app , " wrote Grodsky .
" This is from about 3,000 uniques from limewire redirects . "
Grodksy sent another user count status update a week later revealing that the site had drawn 19,000 unique visitors from LimeWire redirects .
He also informed Saaf that his team was " working on putting Google Analytics all over MiiVi " in order to " better track what people are doing on the site . "
MediaDefender went to great lengths to obscure its affiliation with MiiVi .
" I do n't want MediaDefender anywhere in your e-mail replies to people contacting Miivi , " Saaf instructed company employees .
" Make sure MediaDefender can not be seen in any of the hidden email data crap that smart people can look in . "
Grodsky and Saaf also began discussing new ways to drive traffic to the MiiVi site .
" If we want more users , Dylan 's eDonkey messages would get us a lot of Europeans that are a little bit older crowd , " Grodsky wrote .
" I would like it if our pictures were indexed with goggle [ sic ] .
We need to get as much search traffic as we can , " Saaf replied .
Developer Dylan Douglas also suggested some Google ranking improvement strategies .
" We should come up with a bunch of keywords and a description for the hidden metadata entries to increase traffic , " Douglas told the MiiVi developers .
In late June , Grodsky began considering ways to leverage the MiiVi client application infrastructure .
" Do you think it would break a lot and take more time than its [ sic ] worth for the MiiVi application / installer also to act like Serge 's Proxy client and spoof on eMule ? "
Grodsky asked Saaf .
" We do n't want to do this at this time , " Saaf replied .
" Good idea , but we do n't want to give it a spyware stigma . "
The disclosure
Chaos ensued at the company when TorrentFreak disclosed MediaDefender 's affiliation with MiiVi in early July .
" Looks like the domain transfer screwed us over , " Grodsky wrote in an e-mail which also contained a link to Torrent Freak 's article .
" What needs to happen ?!
Do you want the server pulled ? " he asked Saaf .
" This is really fucked , " Saaf replied .
" Let 's pull miivi offline . "
Shortly after the server was shut down completely , Grodsky sent a follow - up e-mail noting that the story was beginning to spread .
He dutifully requested " damage control " instructions from Saaf and discontinued the LimeWire redirect campaign .
MediaDefender 's damage control program went into full swing shortly after that .
When Douglas pointed out that information about MiiVi had been added to the MediaDefender Wikipedia page , Saaf decided that he wanted it taken down .
" Can you please do what you can to eliminate the entry ?
Let me know if you have any success , " Saaf wrote .
" I will attempt to get all references to miivi removed from wiki , " developer Ben Ebert replied .
" We 'll see if I can get rid of it . "
After a statement Saaf sent to Digital Daily was included in a blog entry , Saaf sent an e-mail to a handful of MediaDefender employees asking if it would be a good idea to post it to the Digg.com news site .
He also suggested possibly having MediaDefender employees post comments .
Referring to the Digg community , MediaDefender co-founder Octavio Herrera replied , " They are n't going to believe you . "
MediaDefender developers also discussed ways to downplay the story or spin it to dull the impact .
" If the major news outlets are n't interested in the story , I would take that as an indication that the VAST majority of people do n't give a shit about this story , " Mairs wrote .
" However , if they do think it 's worth writing about , we definitely want to get our side of the story in the mainstream media , so I think Randy 's plan of going to the big tech media outlets is a good one .
So far the story has only been on techie , geek web sites where everybody already hates us .
If the story stays on these sites , we should let it die . "
Saaf sent Mairs a private reply in response , expressing his personal opinion about the media backlash surrounding the spyware allegations .
" Truth is I do n't give a crap about most of this shit , " Saaf wrote .
The resurrection
Despite the serious failure of MiiVi , MediaDefender decided to try again .
" Looks like we 'll just have to take 2 - 3 weeks of downtime and do some cosmetic work and relaunch , " wrote MediaDefender employee Ty Heath in an e-mail to the MiiVi development team .
" Plus creating another DBA ( or better yet incorporating under a new name ) , getting a new domain , getting another Verisign certificate , getting a new IP range , etc. , " Grosdky replied .
In an e-mail titled " MiiVi redux , " Grodsky asks Saaf if he wanted to " do the incorporating from scratch idea for the MiiVi replacement " instead of the doing - business - as arrangement used for MiiVi .
" If so , " wrote Grodsky , " I have no idea what the turn - around is on creating a complete corporate entity and we would need a name for the new corp . "
Grodksy 's first step was establishing a new mailing address using a mail service in Las Vegas .
" I called the place ( www.maillinkplus.com) and verified the name (s ) on the box and the name (s ) that receive the mail can be different from the name of the company that 's paying by check .
They also e-mail nightly if there 's mail and someone on their staff inputs the FROM address on the envelope to a database that will show us when we login who we got mail from and then we can pick to have those article [ sic ] forwarded to us per item , " wrote Grodsky .
" Worst case scenario paranoia craziness , does anyone have objections with this mail box place being the foundation for all the materials that would have to do with the to - be - named MiiVi ? "
One point that came up during MiiVi resurrection planning was the potential value of the traffic generated by the negative publicity .
" We are leaning toward dumping the URL and just re-launching with a new URL ?
Are we being too hasty because you can't buy 1,000,000 pages linking to you in Google returns . "
Michael Potts , who works for MediaDefender parent company ARTISTDirect , suggested putting a link to the new site on a page at the MiiVi domain so that the new site benefits from MiiVi 's high Google rank .
After an extensive naming discussion , MediaDefender finally decided to bring back MiiVi under the name Viide .
In an e-mail to Potts , Grodsky wrote , " When you get a chance , we would love you to start taking a look at www.viide.com.
That is the current home of our MiiVi site .
We have totally locked - down the site , while we improve the look and feel from [ what ] the blogosphere saw . "
The next step was purging Viide of all references to MiiVi before the official launch .
" I 'm not sure if you guys are planning on going live with the Viide domain name ... but in case you are ... you might want to remove all references of Miivi on the homepage of viide.com before it gets Googled or someone public comes across it , " wrote former MediaDefender developer Tabish Hasan in an e-mail sent to the MiiVi development team .
Development on Viide was ongoing in the most recent e-mails included in the leaked collection .
Providing data for use by law enforcement agencies
In the collection of leaked e-mails , there are several discussions with representatives of the New York Attorney General 's office , including intelligence analyst Bradley J. Bartram and senior special investigator Michael G. McCartney .
MediaDefender is in the process of devising a system that will enable the Attorney General 's office to remotely access MediaDefender 's data about P2P users .
In an e-mail that McCartney sent to Mairs last month , the investigator explained that the matter was " being overseen by the highest members of [ the ] agency " and was considered somewhat urgent .
Although the full scope of the project cannot be extrapolated from the e-mails , the information available indicates that MediaDefender intends to provide the Attorney General 's office with information about users accessing pornographic content .
Other kinds of information could be involved as well .
The e-mails clearly indicate that the data provided by MediaDefender was intended to be used for law enforcement purposes .
In an e-mail to Mairs , Bartram says that the system must be specifically designed " to satisfy the legal and evidentiary requirements " before use .
" On your end , the peer - to - peer crawler will be identifying files matching the established search criteria from various hosts , " wrote Bartram .
" This data will then be collected , filtered for New York resident ip addresses ( to the accuracy limits imposed by geo- query tech ) .
The data will then be transferred to us where ; on our end , a separate piece of software will use that data to connect into the network and download the file from a host and store it on our servers for evidence retention and further analysis . "
It is not clear whether or not the project with the Attorney General 's Office has any connection with the MiiVi project .
At this time , we have not uncovered any substantial evidence to indicate that such a connection exists .
Some evidence in the e-mails indicates that the system devised by MediaDefender in collaboration with the Attorney General 's Office was targeted by a hacker .
" [ A ] n ip from , what appears to be sweden , connected to the server using your username , made two failed password entries and then disconnected 4 seconds after the initial connection , " Bartram informed MediaDefender .
" Considering the nature of the information being collected , I would like to restrict access as much as possible . "
McCartney followed up soon after with an e-mail to Grodsky and Mairs .
" Is this one of your engineers ?
Because if not , this is very disturbing !
Who ever [ sic ] this was obviously had the non standard port as well as your user name to attempt these logins , " wrote McCartney .
" This leads me to believe that your system is compromised and / or our communications were either sniffed or accessed providing this fella with much of the relevant information to attempt access .
As of now , all out side [ sic ] access has been disabled until we can figure this out further . "
It is possible that the individual who attempted to infiltrate the server is associated with the organization behind the MediaDefender e-mail leak .
McCartney 's concerns represent the only instance in the MediaDefender e-mails where anyone expresses suspicion that the messages are being intercepted and obtained by a third party .
Universal Music Group contract
One of the most informative documents included in the leaked e-mails is a draft of MediaDefender 's confidential contract with Universal Music Group .
The contract reveals exact details of MediaDefender 's pricing structure and services and provides insight into which P2P networks the company is targeting .
MediaDefender charges $ 4,000 for one month of protection for an album , and $ 2,000 for one month of protection for a track .
Clients are also given access to MediaDefender 's reports and statistical analysis .
In the contract , the company claims that it " will perform Services against approximately twelve million " file - sharing users at any given time and will target the fifteen most popular P2P networks .
Targeted networks include FastTrack , Gnutella , IRC , Usenet , DirectConnect , eDonkey , MP2P , Kademlia , Overnet , BitTorrent , SoulSeek , and Shareaza .
The contract also provides detailed explanations of MediaDefender 's efficacy testing practices .
Other odds and ends
There is simply too much information in the MediaDefender e-mails for us to cover in detail .
We leave further analysis of the data as an exercise to the reader .
We did encounter , however , a few other things worthy of note .
There are detailed statistics that illuminate the efficacy of MediaDefender 's file - sharing mitigation tactics and an extensive discussion of new techniques used by the company .
The e-mails , unfortunately , also contain some highly sensitive financial information , including a spreadsheet with the salaries , Social Security numbers , and home addresses of individual MediaDefender software developers .
There are also e-mails that discuss MediaDefender 's competition intelligence activities , where they attempt to discover file - sharing mitigation tactics used by competitors like MediaSentry .
The e-mails contain information about the personal life of MediaDefender employees as well .
One particularly ironic example can be found in an e-mail sent by Mairs , the MediaDefender employee whose technical ineptitude was ultimately responsible for the leak .
" I was out of the office yesterday because my son stuck something up his nose and I had to take him to urgent care .
I guess we know where he gets his smarts from ; ) "
The NBC Universal representative who received that e-mail replied sympathetically , " Haha .
I hope it was n't a crayon . "
Conclusion
The cold war being waged between MediaDefender and P2P copyright infringers is rife with mutual deception , but one fact shines through all of the layers of obfuscation : MediaDefender consistently underestimates the ingenuity , resourcefulness , and dedication of its adversaries .
In this case , it could cost the company everything .
Internet users are beginning to demand a higher level of transparency and accountability from companies that operate within the Internet ecosystem .
Companies like MediaDefender that rely on secrecy and discretion unintentionally invite scrutiny by attempting to hide .
Although many of MediaDefender 's innermost secrets have been laid bare by this leak , there are many aspects of the company that remain shrouded in mystery .
The ultimate purpose of the MiiVi site , for instance , is still an enigma .
In some ways , the information in these e-mails raises more questions about MiiVi than it answers .
It is likely that many additional details about MediaDefender 's operations will be disclosed to the public as new secrets are uncovered in the e-mails .
The rate at which these e-mails propagate across the Internet may also stand as a testament to the difficulty of trying to stand between consumers and their torrents .

Just how much is your fee , and also what will be the reasons on which is billed goes on to inform a show a whole lot about the stage .
The most apparent charge routine is that the fee on the amount of money on a percentile basis .
The more money you exchange , the greater sum yove got to cover as its own percentage .
While some may use different versions where only Buyer pay a commission rather than vendors , or a few of these pays a lesser fee , this version is known as the Maker - take version .
There are a whole lot of different payment procedures , the trick here would be to make sure whas your goal of using the system , how much money yore trading , and which system or construction fits you best .
The percentile basis has become the most used system as on a small - mid array it functions best from the favor of their consumers , but when yore trading a great deal of monies , the other versions may be more rewarding for you .
These aretal the things that decide the prevalence or efficacy of Bitcoin markets , however they ’re the most obvious , readily recognizable and powerful ones for certain .

BRUSSELS , Sept. 16  Belgium has given the world Audrey Hepburn , René Magritte , the saxophone and deep - fried potato slices that somehow are called French .
But the back story of this flat , Maryland - size country of 10.4 million is of a bad marriage writ large  two nationalities living together that cannot stand each other .
Now , more than three months after a general election , Belgium has failed to create a government , producing a crisis so profound that it has led to a flood of warnings , predictions , even promises that the country is about to disappear .
“ We are two different nations , an artificial state created as a buffer between big powers , and we have nothing in common except a king , chocolate and beer , ” said Filip Dewinter , the leader of Vlaams Belang , or Flemish Bloc , the extreme - right , xenophobic Flemish party , in an interview .
“ It ’s ‘ bye - bye , Belgium ’ time . ”
Radical Flemish separatists like Mr. Dewinter want to slice the country horizontally along ethnic and economic lines : to the north , their beloved Flanders  where Dutch ( known locally as Flemish ) is spoken and money is increasingly made  and to the south , French - speaking Wallonia , where a kind of provincial snobbery was once polished to a fine sheen and where today old factories dominate the gray landscape .
Excessive noise causes a whole range of disorders , experts say
Noise ban for NYC
Barking dogs , dustcarts , lawn mowers , pneumatic drills and noisy iPods are all targets of the crackdown .
Even Mr
Softee the ice cream van can only play his jingles while moving .
Noise is the biggest cause of calls to the city 's 311 Quality of Life hotline and under the new law , officers will be despatched to investigate complaints .
Mayor Michael Bloomberg pushed for the new laws to be approved in 2005 .
It is the first change in noise regulations in more than 30 years .
" People have a right to sleep and it 's finding that balance - we will do that , " the mayor said .
Experts say excessive noise can cause citizens a whole range of problems from hearing loss to sleep disorders or wider psychological problems .
In New York , it has had residents ringing the 311 hotline off the hook .
Every year , the Quality of Life line receives about 275,000 noise complaints .
Some of the new regulations include :
Pneumatic drills must have noise jackets
Dustcarts have to keep 15 m ( 50 ft ) away from residential buildings overnight
Restrictions on the hours of use of lawn mowers
Ice cream trucks cannot play jingles while stationary
Loud music will incur fines ranging from $ 50 ( £ 25 ) for a portable stereo up to $ 24,000 for restaurants ignoring a first warning .
Night clubs must reduce decibel levels
Cars can be towed away if their alarm goes off for more than three minutes at night
Fines for dog owners whose pets bark for more than 10 minutes continuously during the day or five at night
The last measure has brought howls of protests from dog owners who said people and cars were by far the bigger offenders .
Dog owner Marlene Hussey , who lives on the Upper West Side , told the Newsday newspaper : " Humans make a lot more noise than doggies do .
How are you going to tell a dog you only have five minutes ? "
But Ailen Bronzaft , who helped develop the code , defended the regulations , which came in on Sunday .
She told Agence France - Presse news agency : " New Yorkers are very tolerant and reasonable people : they take the subways , they take the streets , they go out , to the stadium , to parades .
But when they close their doors at home , that is when they expect to be quiet . "
Department of Environmental Protection officers will enforce the laws , although they will not be patrolling the streets .

At 7:45 this morning , Sen. Barack Obama will set vice presidential speculation on fire with a brief stop to say hello to New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg , himself an occasional presidential flirt .
The meeting appeared on Bloomberg 's schedule , which was distributed to reporters last night .
An Obama aide said the meeting was scheduled because of " mutual interest " and did not know whether the two had met before .
More coffee than ticket talk , though -- and Obama had better be brief .
He 's due to speak at the Democratic National Committee 's winter meeting in Vienna , Virginia around noon .
Obama was in New York Thursday for a day of fundraisers , including a young professionals event at Harlem 's historic Apollo theater .
He also grabbed a burger or three at a local White Castle .

The crisis in the American subprime - mortgage market was clearly visible months ago .
Too many homebuyers with a poor or non-existent payment record were lent too much money .
But when the rating agencies on July 10th finally got round to acknowledging the problem , investors were clobbered .
Shares briefly wobbled and the dollar sank .
Swap spreads , a measure of risk aversion , reached their highest point since 2003 .
Credit derivatives , where much of the financial innovation in recent years has taken place , recoiled ( see chart ) .
Investors flocked to the haven of Treasury bonds .
Why were investors so slow to react ?
It seems they have been consistently blindsided by how widespread the subprime problems have become — as well as complacent about the potential spillover into other areas of the debt markets .
At first , investors thought the subprime issue was confined to a few lenders , but the forthright website www.lenderimplode.com suggests that 97 of them have now been hit .
Then they thought that defaults would be confined to a few states in the Midwest but the crisis has spread to heavily populated California and Florida .
The second delay was caused by the way that mortgages had been repackaged and sold .
Initially they were bundled into residential mortgage - backed securities or RMBSs ; Moody's , a rating agency , downgraded 399 of these bonds , while Standard & Poor 's , a rival , indicated it was preparing to downgrade some 612 bonds , worth $ 12 billion .
These bonds are only a small portion of the mortgage - related market .
But according to Josh Rosner of the investment firm Graham Fisher , the agencies suggested further downgrades were to come .
The RMBSs are in turn divided up and placed in instruments called collateralised debt obligations or CDOs .
These were sold to a wide range of investors , depending on their tolerance for risk .
One set of securities , known as an equity tranche , pays the highest returns but is the first to suffer if the underlying bonds default ; other securities offer a much lower yield but a triple - A credit rating , because a lot of defaults would be needed to trigger losses .
The result of this process has , in theory , helped the market .
Bank failures have been at the heart of most financial crises .
But instead of the banks taking the first hit from mortgage defaults , the pain will be spread round the financial system .
However , nobody knows where the risk now lies .
Many of these securities are illiquid , so regular prices are not available .
Indeed , highly rated CDO tranches may still be owned by banks that do not have to put a value on these securities .
They may not recognise the problem until they are forced to by auditors or by ratings downgrades .
On July 11th Moody 's said it may cut its ratings on tranches of 91 CDOs worth about $ 5 billion .
“ My initial analysis suggests we could see massive cumulative losses into the double - A tranches of many RMBS - backed CDOs , ” says Mr Rosner .
( Double - A tranches , as their name suggests , are just below triple - A. )
Those required to ascribe a market value to these securities are faced with what ING , an investment bank , describes as a version of the prisoner 's dilemma .
Everybody would be better off if nobody traded , so that there would be no need to recognise lower prices .
But if everybody is planning to sell , those who trade first will have an advantage .
This problem cropped up when two hedge funds run by Bear Stearns , an investment bank , got into trouble in June .
The Bear funds had borrowed to enhance returns , and in doing so had to post collateral with lenders , known as prime brokers .
When things went wrong , one of the brokers , Merrill Lynch , tried to sell its collateral but soon stopped when it transpired it was only succeeding in driving prices sharply lower .
Eventually , Bear Stearns pledged some of its own money to fill the gap .
But prime brokers may also be shrinking the investor pool by increasing the margin that funds must put up when buying CDO assets ; according to Matt King of Citigroup , the margin requirement on paper rated at the lowest level of investment grade has risen from 10 - 20 % to 50 % .
That is bound to discourage some hedge funds .
All this may reduce the pool of potential mortgage investors .
This effect may be reinforced by other developments .
In recent years , there has been a concerted effort to increase the share of homeowners in America from the post - war average of around 63 % to 70 % .
Lending standards were relaxed and deposits were no longer required .
The extreme was reached with so - called NINJA loans ( borrowers needed no income , job or assets ) .
The influx of new buyers pushed up house prices , which made lenders even more eager .
But as the rating agencies have now discovered , fraud played a part too .
Everybody had an incentive to do a deal , almost regardless of the homebuyers ' ability to repay ; the buyer hoping for a quick profit , the real - estate agent and mortgage broker hoping for a fee .
And the banks did not need to be as concerned about creditworthiness as they used to be , given they would be quickly selling the loan .
Now that defaults have shot up , particularly on loans taken out last year , lending standards are being tightened .
That will reduce the number of potential buyers and put downward pressure on prices .
Many homeowners are already in trouble .
Figures from MacroMavens , an economic consultancy , suggest that 23 % of adjustable - rate mortgages , covering loans with a value of $ 693 billion , are already in negative equity , where the loan is worth more than the property .
But the full impact of defaults may not be felt until the low “ teaser ” rates on mortgages expire and push up borrowing costs .
These teaser loans were done on a “ two and 28 ” basis ( with low rates applying for the first two years , and higher rates for the next 28 ) .
So the worst news from the 2006 vintage may not be felt until 2008 .
Nor does default necessarily mean the end of the road .
Few lenders want to foreclose , a process that takes ages , incurs massive costs and often causes the departing residents to trash the house .
It is better to agree on a quick sale .
But too much selling will force prices lower , weakening the rest of the portfolio .
So it may take a while for the property of struggling borrowers to trickle onto the market .
Jeffrey Kirsch of American Residential Equities , a company specialising in buying delinquent loans , says foreclosing a property can take more than three years .
He doubts the housing market will bottom out until the first quarter of 2009 .
The current fear is not so much that the housing market could drive America into recession , although that could still happen .
The worry is more that credit conditions may get tighter .
The spread paid by higher - risk European firms has increased by almost a percentage point since mid-June .
Investors are shying away from some loans being offered to finance leveraged buy - outs .
A slowdown in such private equity - driven bids would hit the stockmarket .
Richard Bernstein , a Merrill Lynch strategist , says excessive lending has been fuelling the growth in financial markets in recent years .
But he fears that now liquidity is drying up .
That means no cushion when the punch lands .
South Korean scientists have cloned cats by manipulating a fluorescent protein gene , a procedure that could help develop treatments for human genetic diseases .
As part of the procedure 's side effects , the cloned cats glow in the dark when exposed to ultraviolet beams .
A team of scientists led by Kong Il - keun , a cloning expert at Gyeongsang National University , produced three cats with altered fluorescence protein ( RFP ) genes , the Ministry of Science and Technology said yesterday .
Ms Bhutto was rushed from the scene to her Karachi residence
Ms Bhutto , who was travelling from the city 's airport to a rally marking her homecoming after eight years in self - imposed exile , was not hurt .
The truck carrying her had its windows shattered and a door blown off .
The attacks on the motorcade happened despite a heavy security presence following threats from militant groups .
Witnesses described horrific scenes , with bodies and body parts littering the area .
Children were among the dead .
Several Islamist groups , including pro-Taleban militants , had said they would attack Ms Bhutto on her return , after she promised to confront those operating in the northern tribal areas bordering Afghanistan .
Her husband , Asif Ali Zardari , said members of the government and intelligence agencies who were going to lose power were behind the attack .
Ms Bhutto had earlier warned that if targeted , she would hold what she described as hidden authorities within the government as partly responsible .
Extremists will not be allowed to stop Pakistanis from selecting their representatives through an open and democratic process
Gordon Johndroe
White House Spokesman
In quotes : Blast reaction From joy to horror Send us your comments
Ms Bhutto heads the country 's largest political force , the Pakistan People 's Party ( PPP ) .
She wants to contest parliamentary elections due to be held in January and she has been negotiating with President Pervez Musharraf over a possible power - sharing agreement .
The US has backed such a deal , amid concerns about the military 's inability to defeat Islamist militants and Gen Musharraf 's rising unpopularity .
Ms Bhutto has been prime minister twice .
On both occasions , her government was prematurely dismissed by the president of the day under special powers .
She left Pakistan in April 1999 , shortly before Gen Musharraf seized power in a coup - and two years after her husband was jailed and a series of corruption charges were brought against her .
She denies the charges .
Gen Musharraf said the attack on Ms Bhutto's convoy was a " conspiracy against democracy " .
" The president appealed to the nation and especially the people of Karachi to exercise patience and calm in this hour , " said a statement by his office .
The United States also condemned the blasts .
" Extremists will not be allowed to stop Pakistanis from selecting their representatives through an open and democratic process , " said National Security Council spokesman Gordon Johndroe .
' Suicide bomber '
Victoria Schofield , a friend of Ms Bhutto who was also on the bus , said the former prime minister had been standing on top of the bus for six hours , but had just gone downstairs to work on a speech when the first explosion went off .
" We were sitting up on the top and suddenly there was this absolute flash of light and a blast , " she told the BBC .
There was blood all around and it was chaos - we did n't know where to go , what to do
Farzana Raja
PPP spokeswoman

In pictures : Blast scene
" I felt lots of really hot air coming and we all - there were about 15 of us on the top of the bus - we all literally went to the ground . "
Ms Schofield said the first blast was relatively small but that it had had left people sitting on the left - hand side of the bus covered with blood .
She said the first explosion had come from a parked car which police had begun to investigate .
Ms Schofield said a second , much larger explosion occurred two minutes later .
" There was blood all around and it was chaos - and we could n't understand what was happening - we did n't know where to go , what to do , " said Farzana Raja , a spokeswoman for the PPP .
Most of the dead were members of the PPP , although police vehicles took the main force of the blasts and more than 20 police officers are thought to have died .
A cameraman for a local TV station was also killed .
KEY DATES 06 Oct : Presidential polls held 17 Oct : Supreme Court resumes hearing challenges to Musharraf candidacy 18 Oct : Benazir Bhutto 's homecoming 15 Nov : Parliamentary term ends and general election must be held by mid-January
Flying into uncertainty
The chief of police in Karachi , Azhar Farooqi , said a preliminary investigation suggested the second blast had been caused by a suicide bomber .
" The first blast was probably a hand grenade and it did not cause much damage , " he told the BBC .
After the blasts , a dazed Ms Bhutto was immediately rushed from the scene to her Karachi home .
Ms Bhutto flew in from Dubai earlier on Thursday , accompanied by about 100 PPP members .
At least 200,000 people turned out to greet her in what correspondents described as a carnival atmosphere , but the crowds slowed the progress of her convoy .
Ms Bhutto had been planning to make a speech at the tomb of Pakistan 's founding father , Mohammed Ali Jinnah .
Bush Administration cuts $ 700 million in Medicaid funds for schools
President Bush drew criticism this fall for his refusal to fund a childrens health insurance program .
On Friday , his healthcare slashing continued .
According to the Washington Post ,  the Bush administration eliminated about $ 700 million a year in Medicaid reimbursements to schools , sidestepping an attempt by Congress to block such a move . 
Issued by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services , the new rule is projected to save the federal government $ 3.6 billion over five years , transferring those costs to school districts .
Many school principals and superintendents said that the loss of the funding could force districts to cut other programs .
A wide variety of medical services , like speech and physical therapy , are provided to students in schools .
Medicaid , the government 's health insurance program for the poor , will continue to pay for those services for low - income children .
However , the law changes will pay schools for transporting students getting speech or physical therapy to school or back home .
It will also limit when schools can bill the federal government for clerical work necessary with providing health care .
For example , schools can no longer expect Medicaid reimbursement for planning student immunizations .
While hundreds of people who opposed to the change commented in writing to CMS on the proposal , CMS officials said that most of the comments validated their anxiety that schools were improperly using Medicaid funding to pay for services " that are clearly educational in nature . "

Occasionally in Java , you come across an API that makes you sit up and go " What were they thinking ? "
Take , for example , the code to list all the threads in the current ThreadGroup .
Rather than having the obvious method : i.e. one that returns a list ( or array ) of threads , the signature looks like this :
int enumerate ( Thread [ ] list )
You pass an empty array to the method , which will be filled with Thread objects .
The method then returns the number of threads it placed in the array .
If the array is not long enough to accept all the threads , the overflow will be silently discarded .
To initialise the array , you must rely on ThreadGroup # activeCount , which only returns an approximation of the number of threads that enumerate might return .
If you 're looking to avoid memory leaks in a non-garbage - collected environment , then it makes perfect sense for an API to push responsibility for memory management back up its caller , and to gracefully handle whichever buffer - size it 's given to fill .
When you 've got pervasive GC , it just looks ( and is ) clumsy .
So the obvious answer to " What were they thinking ? " , of course , is " They were thinking like C programmers " .
Which in turn leads one to suspect that this particular API has been around since before Java was called Java .
The State of Connecticut wants to bring the consumer - pleasing goodness of the federal Do Not Call registry to other forms of data .
Governor Jodi Rell announced this week that she plans to offer a statewide opt - out service that Connecticut residents can use to keep personal information from being aggregated and acted upon by online data brokers .
" Anyone who goes to WhitePages.com or 411.com will find personal information published that many people may want protected , " Rell said in a statement .
" With a few clicks of the keyboard , anyone can find the age and gender of a person , where they live , where they work , birthdates and other identifying information .
This is a safety and security issue — particularly for our elderly citizens who too often are targeted by scam artists and other opportunists . "
To give residents more control over how their data is used , Rell wants to setup a statewide opt - out registry that would prevent " Internet search sites , credit card solicitations , direct mail lists , and other records " from aggregating personal information .
Since the legislation has yet to be drafted , details are obviously hard to come by .
Given the fact that Rell admits that these sites have n't broken the law , her staff is presumably aware of the difficulties they might run into over the issue of collecting public information .
As Major League Baseball found out back in October , anyone has the right to collect and disseminate public information .
Crafting a bill that allows consumers some control over their publicly - available information and that manages to survive judicial review will be a challenge ; we 'll have to wait until the new year to see how the state meets it .
The bigger issue here is that data privacy has grabbed the public attention and shows no sign of letting go .
Issues that seemed only of interest to geeks a few years back are now major news , though that 's not surprising in the wake of the identity theft scandals and data breaches that have plagued government and corporate database owners this millennium .
Connecticut has recently shown a willingness to stand up to corporate interests like AT&T ( which wanted , and has now received , a statewide video franchise ) and Best Buy ( accused of bait - and - switch tactics using dodgy pricing pulled from a corporate intranet ) .
Its new plan puts it in the vanguard of states attempting to do something about the proliferation of personal data online ; if it succeeds , expect other states to follow its lead .
If it fails — well , other states will probably copy it anyway ( see video game legislation ) .

Because Baylor University is not doing enough to plumb the seas for Noah ’s Ark , an advisory committee of the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board has recommended that the Institute for Creation Research be given the authority to grant Master ’s degrees in science education .

Not at all .

Dec. 7 , 2007  --
Somewhere in an enormous hangar in North Carolina , enormous decals are being stuck to an enormous blimp .
" Who is Ron Paul ?
Google Ron Paul , " the 240,000 - cubic - foot zeppelin will read on one side and " Ron Paul Revolution " on the other when it launches from Elizabeth City , N.C. , Monday and begins its slow , 300 - mile - per - day float up the Eastern Seaboard to Boston .
People in their cars and on park benches , going about their daily lives , are bound to say something like , " What the heck is that blimp doing up there ?
Who the heck is Ron Paul ? "
And that 's pretty much the idea .
For all his recent buzz , Paul remains unknown to most Americans and his libertarian scruples , which set him apart in the Republican Party as the only GOP presidential hopeful against the Iraq War , also make him a stranger to Democrats , many of whom embrace his anti-war stance , but dislike his views on issues like abortion .
Paul's 08 Bid Takes Flight
With any luck , the dirigible will be in the Washington , D.C. , skyline sometime in the afternoon on Monday , although there could be some airspace issues in the greater Washington area .
The plan is to have it floating over Boston Harbor by the weekend of Dec. 15 , where Paul supporters will reenact the Boston Tea Party and hold a large rally at Faneuil Hall .
His online supporters have a fundraising effort , which coincides with the anniversary of the Boston Tea Party .
For more on that , check out Teaparty.com .
If nothing else , the blimp will be unique as a campaign tool and could get the Texas congressman some free attention in the " mainstream media " as his supporters like to call it .
Hiring a blimp at great expense and without any campaign coordination seems like it would be a first in the annals of American elections .
But there are no records to be found on such things .
Launching an Independent Campaign
Like many of the more successful ventures of Paul 's presidential campaign , the blimp has nothing to do directly with Ron Paul the candidate .
The tea party rally , for instance , has some of the same organizers as the blimp enterprise .
While Paul may go to Boston , neither he nor his campaign are helping plan the event .
But they will benefit from the millions that will likely be raised that day , just two weeks before the Iowa caucuses and three weeks before the New Hampshire primary , where Paul is considered to have his best shot .
As campaigners , Paul 's disparate and spirited supporters , though political novices , have shown themselves to be both creative in pushing their candidate and adroit in finding ways around both the traditional media and campaign finance laws .
A Former Election Commissioner Adds His Two Cents
For instance , supporters do not " contribute " money to a Political Action Committee .
To fund the dirigible , they " buy " into a for - profit corporation called Liberty Political Advertising LLC .
With the help of former federal election commissioner Brad Smith , the organizers are confident the arrangement " offers the best of both worlds , no limits and virtually no regulations . "
Of course , there is the possibility that each of the more than 100,000 donators to the blimp enterprise could be required to file their own federal declaration form .
So far , the more than 100,000 supporters buying into the blimp have given anywhere from $ 25 to $ 5,000 , according to Bryce Henderson , the media coordinator for Liberty Political Advertising , based in Simi Valley , Calif .
Individuals are limited by law to giving $ 2,300 to the Paul campaign , although it is fast approaching its goal of $ 12 million in fundraising between October and the end of the year .
Achieving that goal will have more to do with the independent grass - roots efforts than with the Paul campaign .
Supporters Galvanize Around a Platform
" We also wanted to ensure that supporters who would have otherwise donated once , would feel compelled to donate again and again , thus increasing the overall funding for the campaign , " said Eric Nordstrom , the active duty service member posted in England who created RonPaulMoneyBomb.com .
" Our entire goal was to form a Web site that would provide a funnel , which lead directly to Ron Paul 's donation page .
We are just average Joes trying to cast the largest $ 100 , let alone the maximum allowable contribution to make , but they would have $ 25 . "
The official Paul campaign is mounting a more traditional effort with television and radio advertising as well as phone calls to voters in early primary states .
The campaign 's next TV ad , which was shot over Thanksgiving at Paul 's home , will not even mention his Libertarian streak .
It will focus on his personality and his family .
An Idea Takes Flight
Trevor Lyman , an online music promoter based in Florida who had set up the Web site This November5th.com started working with some other fans of the blimp idea in Colorado , California and elsewhere around the country .
They launched RonPaulBlimp.com and have been selling stakes in the leased blimp .
He said he 's confident the blimp violates no campaign financing rules even as it obviously sidesteps them , but said " it could be contested down the road . "
Campaign finance experts not affiliated with the effort agree .
" Given the way this came about , what they are doing and their stated goal , it is very possible they will still be considered a political committee .
For one thing , they are going to have to show that this is truly a business , " said Lawrence Noble , a former general counsel for the Federal Election Commission now in private practice .
" It 's almost too good to be true to have a client pop up as quickly as they have and just say do it , " said George Spyrou , who owns Airship Management Services , the company Paul 's supporters have contracted with .
" Frankly we did n't treat it that seriously until very recently , " said Spyrou in a phone interview last week .
" But it seems to be genuine . "
Spyrou did not want to start prepping the airship until he was relatively sure the Paul supporters could come up with all the money .
" It 's quite an expensive beast to feed and water , " he said .
And Lyman and his supporters do not yet have all the money they will need .
But they have raised more than $ 150,000 and hope to be raise more than $ 400,000 soon .
That would keep the blimp airborne through the Iowa caucuses , even if the blimp never makes it there .
After flying to Boston , it will head over to New Hampshire and stay in that early primary state until weather forces it down .
" Weather permitting " is a big , unknown variable whenever one is dealing with an airship , according to Spyrou .
" If we have snow or strong winds we would rather not fly .
Say anything above 15 or 20 miles an hour , we would rather not fly , " he said .
Even if it is forced down in New Hampshire , the blimp will be moved south to warmer weather and the important primaries in Florida and South Carolina until supporters run out of money .
At that point , many of the early primaries will be over and it will be evident whether or not Paul and his candidacy have run out of air .
Loudest Voice = Majority Opinion
New research reveals even if only one member of a group repeats their opinion , it is more likely to be seen by others as representative of the whole group .
A group of us are sat around shooting the breeze , talking about this that and everything else besides .
Like all British people we always end up with a bit of weather - related chat when the conversation flags .
And sure enough , before long , James is complaining about the unseasonably cool and wet weather that we ’re having at the moment .
“ It just flies in the face of all that ‘ global warming ’ crapola , right ? ” says James .
Now , like the others I know a little bad weather in the short - term does n’t disprove a long - term trend .
But , for whatever reason , I do n’t say anything and neither does anyone else .
He goes on : “ Does n’t it just make you wonder what ’s really going on with all these environmental groups telling us we ’re ruining the planet and all the rest ? ”
The power of repetition
This is starting to get me going a little – I actually think humans are ruining the environment and causing global warming .
Again , though , I ’m lazy and only mumble a few words in disagreement .
I half think James is just trying to wind us up to get the conversation going .
Still , I let it go .
There ’s no more talk on the subject until much later when I ’m with one of the group on his own .
We start on about global warming and the environment again .
It soon becomes clear that he ’s been swayed by what James said earlier .
“ Well no one really said anything against James and I just thought everyone agreed , ” he explains .
“ I thought you guys were all up to date with this sort of thing being scientific types ? ”
I explained to him that James ’ opinions probably bore no relation to what the rest of us thought – it ’s just we had n’t expressed our own opinions .
I do n’t think he believed me , which was annoying .
It seemed the simple act of one person expressing their opinion loudly and clearly in a group setting had convinced him we all felt the same way .
Unfortunately , knowing that group , I saw nothing could be further from the truth .
Our strange brains
A study published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology examined exactly this situation to test how people judge the distribution of opinion .
The study , carried out by Kimberlee Weaver and colleagues , found we can tell that three different people expressing the same opinion better represents the group than one person expressing the same opinion three times – but not by much ( Weaver et al. , 2007 ) .
In fact , if one person in a group repeats the same opinion three times , it has 90 % of the effect of three different people in that group expressing the same opinion .
When you think about it , that is strange .
Indeed , I ’m not sure I ’d even believe it if I had n’t already read many other psychology studies that point to the illogical and unreasonable ways our minds sometimes work .
Where does this effect come from ?
The authors argue it comes down to memory .
Because repetition increases the accessibility of an opinion , we assume it has a high prevalence .
In everyday life we are likely to hear the same opinion many times in different places .
We then put all these together to judge the general mood of a group .
When one person repeats their opinion , we simply over apply the rule .
Familiarity does n’t breed contempt
The theme of this research is something that has been known and used by advertisers and influencers for decades .
Familiarity does n’t breed contempt at all , it breeds attraction .
Making your voice heard is the only way to let others know what you think .
Otherwise they will think you agree with the loudest person .
Similarly , and more worryingly , when an opinion is repeatedly broadcast at us by the same organisation – think of a particular media conglomerate or an advertiser – we ’re likely to come to believe it represents the general opinion .
That ’s despite the fact it is analogous to the same person repeating themselves over and over again .
So , next time James spouts off , I ’ll make a point of speaking up .
And make sure I repeat myself .
Several times .
A I say the blank is the client 's name that I can't disclose .
But it says , I e-mailed this to the client 's name , Karl and Stewart today .
A " I e-mailed this to " -- and that 's the client 's name -- " then Karl and Stewart today . "
Q Okay .
And the general substance of this appears to be an effort to get a Senator to send a letter .
I 'll read the first two sentences of the e-mail .
" I 've been talking with Robby from Hutchinson 's office .
He has offered to try to get the Senator to send this letter . "
And the letter has to do with getting payment on a FEMA matter .
But there 's another bit I 'd like to look at closely , which the majority counsel uses to establish that Rob Riley had an extensive relationship with Simpson and that Riley has gotten Rove to intervene with legal favors in the past .
Here 's the document they 're discussing in this passage .
As you 've probably already sussed out , the transcript from the Jill Simpson interview with HJC is must - read scandal porn .
In it , Simpson clearly states that Rove got involved in the Siegelman prosecution and talked to Public Integrity at DOJ in doing so .
Q Is this Rob Riley 's handwriting ?
A Yes , it is .
Q Okay .
And the Karl that is referenced here -- well , let me ask about Stewart .
Who is the Stewart referenced here ?
A Stewart is a lobbyist that works for the Federalist Group .
Q Here in Washington , D.C. ?
A Yes .
And they 've now been bought out by Ogilvy .
Q
This matter was an effort to collect on a FEMA contract ?
A
That is that 's correct .
Q
And the Karl that is listed here , do you know who that is ?
A I believe that is Karl Rove . Q
And why do you think that 's Karl Rove ?
A Rob -- what Rob would do for us occasionally , he would ask me to do little odds and ends for him , such as follow Don Siegelman and stuff .
And then he for me occasionally would -- if I needed somebody to write a letter to speed up a client getting a check or whatever , he would see if he could find somebody that would help me with that .
And it was not uncommon for him to talk to Karl Rove and Stewart Hall about that because he would make reference to it .
Q
You had heard Karl Rove 's name come up before in conjunction with matters like this ?
A Yes .
And basically what we would do , we would help to write the letter that we wanted or he would help to write it .
He would send it to me for me to approve , then he would send it to Stewart and our -- or whoever .
And they would -- and Karl -- and then they would attempt to get it approved .
You know , I mean get somebody to do it .
[ my emphasis ]
This passage appears to be a response to work Simpson was doing for a client who was trying to collect money on a FEMA contract .
Simpson appears to have asked Riley for help .
To get that help , Riley appears to have called ( and I 'm guessing from the context here ) KayBee Hutchison 's office and gotten her to sign her name to the attached letter on behalf of Simpson 's client .
According to Simspon , this is something Rove did regularly .
And Rove -- and Stewart Hall - - appears to have been right smack in the middle of these negotiations .
And incidentally , just after this passage , the interview goes off the record .
There 's nothing illegal in this .
Riley appears to have done this in exchange for Simpson 's political work -- including her taking pictures at the Klan rally .
Though it is notable that Simpson later got asked by this crowd to do something that Simpson believed was unethical and probably illegal .
A In the fall of 2006 , a Riley campaign person came by my office wanting me to meet with the governor at a -- his birthday party out at Randy and Kelly Owens ' house , who Randy sings in the band Alabama and Randy 's bandmate , Teddy Gentry is my ex-brother - in - law , although he is still my brother - in - law .
I mean , we get along .
I see my ex-husband every day .
But anyway , the thing is this , the governor was having a birthday party out there and they wanted me to meet with them to talk about some campaign stuff .
And this lawyer asked me to do some things I did not feel comfortable with . [ snip ]
A
The Bar said that I could talk to Joe Espy , so I called him back and I told Joe Espy what they had asked me to do .
Joe Espy felt it was illegal , I believe .
I mean , he indicated that to me .
And , anyway , at one point he says good God , why would they ask you , Jill Simpson , lawyer from Rainsville , to do this .
[ my emphasis ]
So Riley gets local lawyers to do his dirty work , possibly extending to include illegal favors .
And in exchange Karl Rove and a professional lobbyist return the favor - - for free .
Hall has never registered as a lobbyist for a trucking company ( which sounds like it might apply to Simpson 's client ) and his only work for disaster and emergency services -- FEMA 's core business -- came in 2006 and 2007 .
So it appears that whatever company he helped Simpson with , he did not register with ( and presumably did not get paid by ) .
It sure does make you wonder what Stewart Hall got in exchange for giving his core business away for free , does n't it ?
Amy Winehouse Booed Off Stage
Troubled songstresswas booed off stage on the first night of her UK tour in Birmingham last night .
Winehouse slurred her way through " Rehab , " " Back to Black " and " Tears Dry on Their Own , " and dedicated " Wake Up Alone " to husband Blake Fielder - Civil who is currently in prison awaiting trial for witness tampering .
As streams of people left during the concert , Winehouse announced " To them people booing , wait ' til my husband gets out of incarceration .
And I mean that . "
During an encore performance , a cover of The Zuton 's " Valerie , " Winehouse stopped singing , dropped her microphone and walked off stage .
Fan reviews of the concert were mixed , with many feeling sympathy for the singer .
Personally , I think it 's time Amy Winehouse said yes , yes , yes to rehab .
1. RADIOHEAD : ‘ IN RAINBOWS ’ ( ATO ) .
While Radiohead ’s discontinued pay - what - you - want proposition for downloading its new album made a great music - business story , the more lasting news is that “ In Rainbows ”  in either its one - disc or two - disc configurations  needs no gimmicks .
The songs sound tuneful and modest , often pared down to just a handful of instruments .
But they work up knotty structures and plunge into a troubled mind - set where nothing is secure : not relationships , businesses , identities or song forms .
2. FEIST : ‘ THE REMINDER ’ ( Cherry Tree / Interscope ) .
Immediately appealing melodies , thoughts of love and Leslie Feist ’s gracious voice make “ The Reminder ” a pop album , but never a shallow one .
Enigmatic lyrics and complex emotions come through the transparency of the arrangements , and the album is filled not only with immediate feelings but also with memories and what - ifs , hints and conundrums .
3. AMY WINEHOUSE : ‘ BACK TO BLACK ’ ( MCA Universal ) .
As 2007 began , Amy Winehouse ’s second album announced the international arrival of a sly , tart - voiced , jazz - and - soul - loving songwriter from London who twisted vintage sounds for modern predicaments .
In her songs she already knew too much about alcohol , drugs , succumbing to temptations and spurning rehab , and she neatly balanced self - consciousness and self - destruction .
What followed , of course , has not been neat at all .
4. IRON AND WINE : ‘THE SHEPHERD’S DOG ’ ( Sub Pop ) .
Intricate , hypnotic , fingerpicking vamps carry Sam Beam ’s gentle voice and visionary songs on “ The Shepherd ’s Dog . ”
The 1960s of quiet psychedelia and East - West , Indo - Appalachian fusions suffuse the album , but so do West African rock , the deconstructions of dub reggae , and contemporary thoughts of war , faith and disquiet .
It appears that Everex , the same company that sent Wal - Mart shoppers into a tizzy of values with its Linux - based gPC , now has its sites set on the Asus Eee PC with a new ultra-portable dubbed the " Cloudbook . "
The device will feature a 7 - inch screen and the same Linux gOS found in the gPC .
A 1.3 megapixel webcam is also rumored to come standard .
Additional image and info after the break .

In order to reduce costs , the device will utilize a 30 GB hard drive as opposed to the flash storage found in the Eee PC .
It will also be powered by a 1.2GHz Via C7 ULV processor — unlike the Eee PCs 900MHz Celeron .
Other rumored specs include 512MB of RAM , built - in wired and wireless Ethernet interfaces , a 4 - in - 1 card reader , a pair of USB 2.0 ports and DVI - out .
There is also a developers ' version that features a touchscreen UI , Skype phone and alarm clock module ( similar to the NanoBook ) .
Nothing is set in stone here , including the specs , but the device is expected to ship on January 15th for $ 400 .
The developer 's version may arrive as early as the January 1st — although pricing info is not yet known .
[ Linux Devices via Electronista ]
I 've uploaded new builds of Firefox with experimental support for the WHATWG < video > element .
They are ( compiled from this git commit ) :
The git repository has been updated with the code for this build .
Note that the code in these builds , and the git repository , is advanced from that in the patch attached to the video element bugzilla entry .
That code can be accessed from git via the patch11 tag .
The usual disclaimer with the builds I provide applies .
Be aware that these are builds from a random point in the Mozilla CVS tree , with the Video patch applied .
I do n't guarantee they 'll work for much more than demonstrating video support and it's very likely to contain bugs .
That said , I run these builds often .
Two main additions with this build .
The first is fixing the annoying bug whereby leaving a page that is playing video would leave the sound running in the background .
This was due to the ' bfcache ' keeping the page around in case the user hits the back or forward buttons .
The video is effectively paused now when the page is in the bfcache .
The second is preliminary support for the < source > element , which can be used to provide a list of media resources , with mime types , and the browser selects out of the list the media resource to play based on what it supports .
This initial implementation only supports a ' type ' attribute set to ' video / ogg ' .
What this will let you do though , is add a source element for an MP4 encoding , and one for an Ogg encoding .
When played on Firefox the Ogg version will play , and a browser that currently does n't support Ogg but supports MP4 can choose to play that instead .
Issues I have partial fixes for but have n't yet made it into the main branch of the git repository , and not in these builds are :
Sound support on Linux is patchy .
I 'm using sydney audio's OSS support which has issues when multiple devices open / dev/dsp .
This can occasionally affect synchronisation of the video .
There is no buffering for network loads .
The video plays immediately so on a slow pipe or large video the playback will stutter .
You can pause the video to let the download catch up but there is no progress indication yet .
This can make performance look worse than it is in bandwidth constrained environments .
Seeking forward and back in the stream .
There is some support , but it 's a work in progress and quite broken .
You might notice that full page zoom works in this build .
And it works with videos .
You can zoom a page and any videos on the page are zoomed .
You can test this with Ctrl+ ( Apple - + on the Mac ) .
Test videos are available at my test page , or Opera 's page .
There are sites using the < video > right now .
The Metavid project has support for the < video > element .
If you look at the videos in a < video > enabled browser , the player is the interface provided with the ' controls ' attribute set .
For example , Senate Proceeding 11-16-07 .
Nice job , Metavid , and thanks for using < video >!
The Wikimedia video's seems to have experimental support for it .
Unfortunately the test to see if the video element is supported appears to be done last , so usually the Java applet , etc is found first .
You can get around this by setting a cookie .
When the Wikimedia video page open , enter this in the URL bar :
javascript:wgOggPlayer.setCookie(' ogg_player ' , ' videoElement ' , 7*86400*1000 , false , false , false , false )
Remove it by deleting the ' commons.wikimedia.org ' cookie if you want to go back to the default ordering of selections .
You 'll notice some issues , which is probably why it 's currently right at the end of the chain .
Clicking on the video picture and pressing play works fine .
But clicking the play button on the main page listing all the videos does not correctly display the video .
I 'll look into what 's causing this .
If you know of any other < video > supported sites , please let me know in the comments .
I 'll be attending the W3C Video on the Web Workshop in San Jose on the 12th and 13th of December .
I fly out from Auckland on the 9th and leave San Francisco on the 16th .
If you 're in the area and want to catch up , let me know .

Lead , Fluoride , the Roman Empire and the Decline of Academic Achievement in the United States by Dan Montgomery
November 1 , 1997
Could fluoride contribute to an impairment of academic performance ?
In 1995 , Dr. Mullenix and others published a report of lab research showing that sodium fluoride caused brain defects in rats .
Sodium fluoride is not the acid fluoride that is commonly added to public water systems , but there is no reason to doubt that the fluoride ions from acid fluoride are as harmful as the fluoride ions from sodium fluoride .
Heavy metals and toxic chemicals may have already contributed to the economic decline of the United States .
During the last half of the twentieth century , we have had an era of acid fluoride and metal water pipes .
Heavy metals are leached from metal water pipes because of the low pH of water in many parts of the United States .
Older homes were built with metal water pipes .
These metal water pipes are found typically in central cities .
During most of the era of fluoridation , acid fluoride was added to public water supplies without regard to how much it contributed to the leaching of heavy metals .
The EPA now recommends that sodium hydroxide be added to water systems to raise the pH high enough to reduce the corrosion of metal pipes and water fixtures to politically acceptable levels .
The ancient Romans used lead for making water pipes , cooking utensils , water tanks and storage vessels .
Lead water pipes were used in most major cities in the empire .
Wine was cheap in ancient Rome and Athens and it was contaminated with lead from as many as 14 sources during its preparation .
Lead was used as part of the preservative and as a flavor enhancer .
Even the Christian sacramental cups of that era were the kind that were made of lead or leaded bronze common at the time .
Apathy and gluttony have been associated with the decline of the Roman Empire .
It may have been the lead in food , water and wine which caused the apathy .
Musonius , a Roman writing in the first century A.D. , observed that masters were weaker , less healthy and less able to endure labor than the servant class .
Those who grew up in the country were stronger than those who grew up in the city .
Those who ate plain food were likely to live longer and have less of the diseases associated , by hindsight , with lead poisoning .
These were " gouts , " " dropsies " and colics . "
This is as close as anyone got to discovering chronic lead poisoning in the Roman Empire and leaving a record of the hypothesis .
The rich received more than their share of lead poisoning because they could afford more of the sources of lead contamination .
When soft water sits in lead pipes , it leaches the lead from the pipes .
In ancient Rome , the rich controlled most of the public water outlets .
The first drawn water of the morning , which had been sitting over night absorbing lead , was a privilege of the rich .
The evidence suggests that the offspring of parents with lead poisoning were more likely to be underachievers and had a high infant mortality rate .
Chronic lead poisoning persistently destroyed the Roman aristocracy , thus creating a scarcity of good management .
Old aristocratic families died out only to be replaced by others who suffered the same fate .
Nriagu conludes that lead contamination was a major cause of the decline of the Roman Empire . ( 1 )
Today , a real attempt is being made to keep lead out of public water systems .
The decline of intelligence may not all be ascribed to lead and acid fluoride .
There are other heavy metals and other toxic chemicals .
The element of history that is repeating itself is that the damage to intelligence and behavioral ability impairs activities which require good mental ability .
The biological causes are unknown , ignored or delt with ineffectively .
As a result , economic productivity is less than it would have been and the ability to manage a complex political and economic system declines .
In ancient Rome , the aristocracy lost its ability to govern competently because of lead poisoning .
It is probable that they had chronic lead intoxication .
Poor management by the aristocracy contributed to the decline of the empire .
New technology and investment are made more profitable by a highly trained work force .
The decline of academic achievement has an effect on the economy .
In the first half of this century , the IQ test scores of Ameridcan high school students increased an average of 1.69 points per decade .
Academic achievement scores continued to rise until about 1967 and then declined until 1980 .
This decline was a total of 1.23 grade - level equivalents , which means a graduating high school senior in 1980 knew less than an eleventh grader in 1967 .
High school students graduating in 1967 would have been born around 1950 , the beginning of the era of fluoride toothpaste and fluoridation .
Until 1973 , each generation joined the work force with a better academic preparation than earlier generations who had the same amount of years in school .
This improvement has ceased .
the declining test scores have a ripple effect .
The productivity of the 18 to 24 age group is affected first , then that of the 25 to 34 age group and so on .
Because teenagers contribute litle to the economy , the loss of productivity was not noticeable until the middle of the 1970's when the students with the declining test scores started entering the labor force .
The major impact of declining test scores came in the 1980's .
There should have been greater productivity growth because of favorable economic conditions , but it did n't happen .
It has been estimated that during the 1990's the productivity growth rate will be nearly 2 % per year less than it would have been if academic achievement had not declined .
The lack of adequately trained personnel for high paying jobs will continue to increase until at least the year 2010 .
The productivity loss currently may be about $ 86 billion per year and John Bishop predicted it may double in about fifteen years from the 1989 date of his economic research .
The indirect cost may be even greater .
Underachievers are more likely to live on welfare and get into trouble with the law . ( 2 )
From 1983 to 1988 , the test scores of applicants for medical school declined .
This can not be attributed to the doors being opened to larger numbers of students .
The ratio of applicants to those who were accepted was 2.8:1 in 1975 .
Bty 1985 , it had declined to 1.:1 .
This decline is affecting all branches of medicine .
A smaller proportion of medical students are interested in pursuing a career in internal medicine . ( 3 )
The Journal of the American Dental Association has published cover stories on dental fluorosis , but the choice of offically recognized effects is limited and they still think that fluorosis is something that can be controlled by dentists as managers of their patient 's dental health .
The American Pediatrics Society has warned pediatricians that fluoride supplements for young children should be carefully controlled .
They still think that fluoride intake of young children can be adequately controlled by pediatricians as if every family could afford extended pediatric health care .
They naively believe that it is easy and economical to measure total fluoride intake of each young child .
Many explanations for the decline of academic achievement have been offered .
There may be a grain of truth to all of them .
One explanation that should not be overlooked is that a combination of fluoride and heavy metals has persistently contributed to the decline of academic achievement .
During the early years of fluoridation , acid fluoride was added to public water systems without concern for the leaching of heavy metals from old metal pipes .
It 's not the lead poisoning that repeats history so much as it is the lack of control of chemical contamination .
The economic system is driven by distorted priorities .
The human resource is being damaged .
Off shore industries are now plundering human resources in other countries .
It takes a generation to see the damage .
Measuring the damage after it has happened will do little good .

The foundation that runs Wikipedia has finally agreed to pay contributors to the online encyclopedia a modest fee for their work .
But it wo n’t pay the thousands of people who participate in creating the wiki pages — just artists who create “ key illustrations ” for the site .
The payments are made possible by a $ 20,000 donation from Philip Greenspun , who said he was moved to give the money because of his experience seeing technical books he had originally published online appear in print .
“ In comparing the Web versions to the print versions , I noticed that the publishers ’ main contribution to the quality of the books was in adding professionally drawn illustrations , ” he wrote in an e-mail message .
“ It occurred to me that when the dust settled on the Wikipedia versus Britannica question , the likely conclusion would be ‘ Wikipedia is more up to date ; Britannica has better illustrations . ’”
The woman running the project for Wikipedia , Brianna Laugher , says the plan is to create a list of articles that need illustrations and then solicit the work .
The first list is expected to have 50 illustrations and be completed this month .
Contributors will be able to sign up for an illustration and have two weeks to submit it ; if it is accepted , the illustrator will be paid $ 40 .
It ’s common to hear developers promote layering as a means to provide extensibility .
The most common example , and one I used in Part 2 when we looked at interfaces , is the ability to switch out your data access layer in order to connect to a different database .
If your projects are anything like mine , you know upfront what database you ’re going to use and you know you are n’t going to have to change it .
Sure , you could build that flexibility upfront – just in case – but what about keeping things simple and You Are n’t Going To Need IT ( YAGNI ) ?
I used to write about the importance of domain layers in order to have re-use across multiple presentation layers : website , windows applications and web services .
Ironically , I ’ve rarely had to write multiple front - ends for a given domain layer .
I still think layering is important , but my reasoning has changed .
I now see layering as a natural by - product of highly cohesive code with at least some thought put into coupling .
That is , if you build things right , it should automatically come out layered .
The real reason we ’re spending a whole part on decoupling ( which layering is a high - level implementation of ) is because it ’s a key ingredient in writing testable code .
It was n’t until I started unit testing that I realized how tangled and fragile my code was .
I quickly became frustrated because method X relied on a functional class Y which needed a database up and running .
In order to avoid the headaches I went through , we ’ll first cover coupling and then look at unit testing in the next part .
( A point about YAGNI .
While many developers consider it a hard rule , I rather think of it as a general guideline .
There are good reasons why you want to ignore YAGNI , the most obvious is your own experience .
If you know that something will be hard to implement later , it might be a good idea to build it now , or at least put hooks in place .
This is something I frequently do with caching , building an ICacheProvider and a NullCacheProvider implementation that does nothing , except provide the necessary hooks for a real implementation later on .
That said , of the numerous guidelines out there , YAGNI , DRY and Sustainable Pace are easily the three I consider the most important . )
Sneak Peak at Unit Testing
Talking about coupling with respect to unit testing is something of a chicken and egg problem – which to talk about first .
I think it ’s best to move ahead with coupling , providing we cover some basics about unit testing .
Most importantly is that unit tests are all about the unit .
You are n’t focusing on end - to - end testing but rather on individual behavior .
The idea is that if you test each behavior of each method thoroughly and test their interaction with one and other , you ’re whole system is solid .
This is tricky given that the method you want to unit test might have a dependency on another class which ca n’t be easily executed within the context of a test ( such as a database , or a web - browser element ) .
For this reason , unit testing makes use of mock classes – or pretend class .
Let ’s look at an example , saving a car ’s state :
public class Car { private int _id ; public void Save ( ) { if (! IsValid ( ) ) { // todo : come up with a better exception throw new InvalidOperationException ( " The car must be in a valid state " ) ; } if ( _id == 0 ) { _id = DataAccess.CreateInstance ( ) .
Save ( this ) ; } else { DataAccess .CreateInstance ( ) .
Update ( this ) ; } } private bool IsValid ( ) { // todo : make sure the object is in a valid state return true ; } }
To effectively test the Save method , there are three things we must do :
Make sure the correct exception is thrown when we try to save a car which is in an invalid state , Make sure the data access ’ save method is called when it ’s a new car , and Make sure the Update method is called when it ’s an existing car .
What we do n’t want to do ( which is just as important as what we do want to do ) , is test the functionality of IsValid or the data access ’
Save and Update functions ( other tests will take care of those ) .
The last point is important – all we want to do is make sure these functions are called with the proper parameters and their return value ( if any ) is properly handled .
It ’s hard to wrap your head around mocking without a concrete example , but mocking frameworks will let us intercept the Save and Update calls , ensure that the proper arguments were passed , and force whatever return value we want .
Mocking frameworks are quite fun and effective ….unless you ca n’t use them because your code is tightly coupled .
Not ALL coupling is bad
In case you forgot from Part 1 , coupling is simply what we call it when one class requires another class in order to function .
It ’s essentially a dependency .
All but the most basic lines of code are dependent on other classes .
Heck , if you write string site = “ CodeBetter ” , you ’re coupled to the System .
String class – if it changes , your code could very well break .
Of course the first thing you need to know is that in the vast majority of cases , such as the silly string example , coupling is n’t a bad thing .
We do n’t want to create interfaces and providers for each and every one of our classes .
It ’s ok for our Car class to hold a direct reference to the Upgrade class – at this point it ’d be overkill to introduce and IUpgrade interface .
What is n’t ok is any coupling to an external component ( database , state server , cache server , web service ) , any code that requires extensive setup ( database schemas ) and , as I learnt on my last project , any code that generates random output ( password generation , key generators ) .
That might be a somewhat vague description , but after this and the next part , and once you play with unit testing yourself , you ’ll get a feel for what should and should n’t be avoided .
Since it ’s always a good idea to decouple your database from your domain , we ’ll use that as the example throughout this part .
Dependency Injection
In Part 2 we saw how interfaces can help our cause – however , the code provided did n’t allow us to dynamically provide a mock implementation of IDataAccess for the DataAccess factory class to return .
In order to achieve this , we ’ll rely on a pattern called Dependency Injection ( DI ) .
DI is specifically tailored for the situation because , as the name implies , it ’s a pattern that turns a hard - coded dependency into something that can be injected at runtime .
We ’ll look at two forms of DI , one which we manually do , and the other which leverages a third party library .
Constructor Injection
The simplest form of DI is constructor injection – that is , injecting dependencies via a class ’ constructor .
First , let ’s look at our DataAccess interface again and create a fake ( or mock ) implementation ( do n’t worry , you wo n’t actually have to create mock implementations of each component , but for now it keeps things obvious ) :
internal interface IDataAccess { int Save ( Car car ) ; void Update ( Car car ) ; } internal class MockDataAccess : IDataAccess { private readonly List < Car > _cars = new List < Car >( ) ; public int Save ( Car car ) { _cars .
Add( car ) ; return _cars .
Count ; } public void Update ( Car car ) { _cars[ _cars .
IndexOf( car ) ] = car ; } }
Although our mock ’s upgrade function could probably be improved , it ’ll do for now .
Armed with this fake class , only a minor change to the Car class is required :
public class
Car { private int _id ; private IDataAccess _dataProvider ; public Car( ) : this ( new SqlServerDataAccess ( ) ) { } internal Car( IDataAccess dataProvider ) { _dataProvider = dataProvider ; } public void Save ( ) { if (! IsValid ( ) ) { // todo : come up with a better exception throw new InvalidOperationException ( " The car must be in a valid state " ) ; } if ( _id == 0 ) { _id = _dataProvider .
Save ( this ) ; } else { _dataProvider .
Update ( this ) ; } } private bool IsValid ( ) { // todo : make sure the object is in a valid state return true ; } }
Take a good look at the code above and follow it through .
Notice the clever use of constructor overloading means that the introduction of DI does n’t have any impact on existing code – if you choose not to inject an instance of IDataAccess , the default implementation is used for you .
On the flip side , if we do want to inject a specific implementation , such as a MockDataAccess instance , we can :
public void AlmostATest ( ) { Car car = new Car(new MockDataAccess ( ) ) ; car .
Save ( ) ; if ( car .
Id !=
1 ) { //something went wrong } }
There are minor variations available – we could have injected an IDataAccess directly in the Save method or could set the private _dataAccess field via an internal property – which you use is mostly a matter of taste .
Frameworks
Doing DI manually works great in simple cases , but can become unruly in more complex situations .
A recent project I worked on had a number of core components that needed to be injected – one for caching , one for logging , one for a database access and another for a web service .
Classes got polluted with multiple constructor overloads and too much thought had to go into setting up classes for unit testing .
Since DI is so critical to unit testing , and most unit testers love their open - source tools , it should come as no surprise that a number of frameworks exist to help automate DI .
The rest of this article will focus on StructureMap , a Dependency Injection framework created by fellow CodeBetter blogger Jeremy Miller .
( http://structuremap.sourceforge.net/)
Before using StructureMap you must configure it using an XML file ( called StructureMap.config ) or by adding attributes to your classes .
The configuration essentially says this is the interface I want to program against and here ’s the default implementation .
The simplest of configurations to get StructureMap up and running would look something like :
< StructureMap > < DefaultInstance PluginType=" CodeBetter.Foundations .IDataAccess , CodeBetter.Foundations " PluggedType=" CodeBetter.Foundations.SqlServerDataAccess , CodeBetter.Foundations " /> </StructureMap >
While I do n’t want to spend too much time talking about configuration , it ’s important to note that the XML file must be deployed in the / bin folder of your application .
You can automate this in VS.
NET by selecting the files , going to the properties and setting the Copy To Ouput Directory attribute to Copy Always .
( There are a variety of more advanced configuration options available .
If you ’re interested in learning more , I suggest the StructureMap website ) .
Once configured , we can undo all the changes we made to the Car class to allow constructor injection ( remove the _dataProvider field , and the constructors ) .
To get the correct IDataAccess implementation , we simply need to ask StructureMap for it , the Save method now looks like :
public class Car { private int _id ; public void Save ( ) { if (! IsValid ( ) ) { // todo : come up with a better exception throw new InvalidOperationException ( " The car must be in a valid state " ) ; } IDataAccess dataAccess = ObjectFactory.GetInstance<IDataAccess >( ) ; if ( _id == 0 ) { _id = dataAccess .
Save ( this ) ; } else { dataAccess .
Update ( this ) ; } } private bool IsValid ( ) { // todo : make sure the object is in a valid state return true ; } }
To use a mock rather than the default implementation , we simply need to inject the mock into StructureMap :
public void AlmostATest ( ) { ObjectFactory.InjectStub(typeof( IDataAccess ) , new MockDataAccess ( ) ) ; Car car = new Car( ) ; car .
Save ( ) ; if ( car .
Id !=
1 ) { //something went wrong } ObjectFactory.ResetDefaults ( ) ; }
We use InjectStub so that subsequent calls to GetInstance return our mock , and make sure to reset everything to normal via ResetDefaults .
DI frameworks such as StructureMap are as easy to use as they are useful .
With a couple lines of configuration and some minor changes to our code , we ’ve greatly decreased our coupling which increased our testability .
In the past , I ’ve introduced StructureMap into existing large codebases in a matter of minutes – the impact is minor .
Conclusion
Reducing coupling is one of those things that ’s pretty easy to do yet yields great results towards our quest for greater maintainability .
All that ’s required is a bit of knowledge and discipline – and of course , tools do n’t hurt either .
It should be obvious why you want to decrease the dependency between the components of your code – especially between those components that are responsible for different aspects of the system ( UI , Domain and Data being the obvious three ) .
In the next part we ’ll look at unit testing which ’ll really leverage the benefits of dependency injection .
If you ’re having problems wrapping your head around DI , take a look at my more detailed article on the subject at http://dotnetslackers.com/articles/designpatterns/IntroducingDependencyInjectionFrameworks.aspx.

You could be in the Garden of Eden if you had just kept your fucking mouth shut and had n't asked any questions .

My solos are speech - influenced rhythmically ; and harmonically , they 're either pentatonic , or poly - scale oriented .
And there 's the mixolydian mode that I also use a lot ...
But I 'm more interested in melodic things I think the biggest challenge when you go to play a solo is trying to invent a melody on the spot .

Well I think that progress is not possible without deviation .
And I think that it 's important that people be aware of some of the creative ways in which some of their fellow men are deviating from the norm , because in some instances they might find these deviations inspiring and might suggest further deviations which might cause progress , you never know .

Oui interview ( 1979 ) [ edit ]
I ca n’t see any authority on the horizon that ’s got any answers that seem worthwhile .
Most of the things that are suggested are probably detrimental to your mental health .
Certification from one source or another seems to be the most important thing to people all over the world .
…
People are just waiting around to get certified .
Just because somebody hears something you say , or reads something that you write , does n’t mean you ’ve reached them .
Everything on this planet has something to do with music .
Music functions in the realm of sculptured air .
You know , people are basically shitty .
It ’s when they prove it over and over again that it gets obnoxious .
We live in a very special time right now .
At no other time in history has there been such mass disillusionment in terms of reliance on governing functions .
Most people do n’t want to come to terms with that .
It ’s been proven over and over again that the emperor is n’t wearing any clothes , but most people do n’t like to look at naked emperors .
In the process of turning around to avert their eyes , they saw the discotheques and a few other things and latched onto them .
There ’s no reason to assume that my idea of what ‘s better would really be better .
I resent it when other people try to inflict their ideas of betterness on me .
I do n’t think they know .
And I ca n’t see any authority on the horizon that ’s got any answers that seem worthwhile .
Most of the things that are suggested are probably detrimental to your mental health .
Organized religions by their very natures are misleading .
The bottom line is always money .
What that ’s got to do with your spiritual well - being still eludes me .
It ’s always the bucks , no matter how they disguise it .
If you need that sort of assistance to keep yourself together , you may be paying a higher rate to a fake religion than you would to a psychotherapist .
Which is not to say that a psychotherapist is going to give you any better value per dollar either .
lf you ’re going to deal with reality , you ’re going to have to make one big discovery : Reality is something that belongs to you as an individual .
If you wanna grow up , which most people do n’t , the thing to do is take responsibility for your own reality and deal with it on your own terms .
Do n’t expect that because you pay some money to somebody else or take a pledge or join a club or run down the street or wear a special bunch of clothes or play a certain sport or even drink Perrier water , it ’s going to take care of everything for you .
Because it all comes from inside .
As a matter of fact , that ’s where it stays .
Certification from one source or another seems to be the most important thing to people all over the world .
A piece of paper from a school that says you ’re smart , a pat on the head from your parents that says you ’re good or some reinforcement from your peers that makes you think what you ’re doing is worthwhile .
People are just waiting around to get certified .
The lifestyle that I have is probably neither desirable nor useful to most people .
Most people are probably better off getting the certification they desire and spindling their lives away the way they ’re doing .
I do n’t think they ’d enjoy living any other way .
There are millions of people who acquire all sorts of wonderful feelings from watching a football game and drinking a bottle of beer .
It makes them really happy .
Does n’t do shit for me .
But for them it ’s life itself .
As long as they can believe in the beer and the football , then they ’ve really got something .
And it ’s probably more useful to them than religion .
So why take it away ?
Why tell them what ’s really going on ?
Let ’em be happy .
If a person wants to write music and lyrics , he has a perfect right to express his views on a certain subject .
I would feel wrong if I were to express anything that I did n’t believe in .
I write what I like to write .
Those who like to listen to it , listen to it .
And the ones who do n’t , watch football and drink beer , jog , go to discos and so forth .
I never claimed to be a man for all seasons .
Just because somebody hears something you say , or reads something that you write , does n’t mean you ’ve reached them .
With reading comprehension being what it is in the U. S. , you can safely toss that one out the window .
If you want to judge by the listening habits of people who buy records , the first thing they do is put it on and talk over it .
So much gets lost in the translation .
Even if you sat there listening to it with a microscope , there ’s no way you ’re gonna find out what it means .
People have preposterous ideas about what those songs are about and what the music means .
They start spouting all this shit that ’s so far off the mark , it ’s revolting .
But if that ’s how they derive pleasure , who am I to deprive them of it ?
Let ’em enjoy it .
It ’s there for their edification .
But total comprehension is out of the question .
I ca n’t talk to you about music because you do n’t know anything about music .
I can talk to you about politics or sociology and all that peripheral stuff , but I ca n’t talk to you about music .
There ’s not enough information in common that I could say to you so you ’d be able to understand .
Besides , the people who read OUI do n’t give a fuck about music anyway .
The cool - person syndrome is peculiarly American .
Part of that has to do with the way the educational business is run in the U.S.
It ’s not based on how much you can teach your child : it ’s based on how much money the suppliers of basic materials can make off your child .
Somewhere along the line most people pick up the desire to be a cool person , which is just another way to make them buy things .
Once you ’ve decided that you need to be a cool person , it makes you a possible victim of anyone whose products are the equivalent of bottled smoke .
Somebody tells you to buy this particularly useless item and you ’ll be a cool person .
No matter how stupid it seems , you have to buy it .
Pet Rocks .
Pringle ’s potato chips .
whatever it is — the newest , the latest .
Since the cool - person thing is something you learn in school , and since the school business is pretty suspicious and definitely tied up with the government , it makes you wonder whether or not the desire to be cool is part of a government plot to make you buy stupid things .
The U.S. is a mere pup tent of a civilization .
We ’ve got two hundred years of stupidity behind us and we think we ’re right up there with everyone else who ’s been doing it for thousands of years .
The richest people in the world are n’t particularly smart or happy .
And the happiest people in the world are n’t particularly smart or rich . …
That leaves me making music .
But we ca n’t talk about that .
Everything on this planet has something to do with music .
Music functions in the realm of sculptured air .
Polluted as our atmosphere might be , air is the thing that makes music work .
Since all other things that occur in the sound domain are transmitted to the ear through that swirling mass , depending on how wide you want to make your definition , you could perceive quite a bit of human experience in terms of music .
I think the music of the Fifties is really good .
I suspect it ’s much better musically than much of what ’s available now .
Not in terms of production , but in terms of content .
One good believable song about some guy ’s girlfriend and how they broke up — a sincere one — is better than twenty albums of English rock that ’s ever been produced .
Most people do n’t think I ’m rational .
They ’re too busy featuring their hurt .
They find it irrational not to feature your hurt .
That ’s how fucked up they are .
There is n’t anything weird about my music .
Weird is a skeleton in the closet , wearing a rubber mask with warts all over its nose , and all that kind of shit .
That ’s not what I do .
The thing that makes my music unusual is that people only hear one kind of music all the time over the radio .
It ’s wallpaper to their lives .
Audile wallpaper .
There ’s one acceptable beat and there are three acceptable chord progressions .
There are five acceptable words : baby , love , tears , yat yat .
Just because I do n’t deal in those terms does n’t mean I ’m weird .
So tell these people : I ai n’t weird ; I ’m rational .
I ’m a person who can choose to write stuff like that , or choose to write stuff that includes all the notes on the piano played at once , followed by a cement truck driving over the piano , followed by a small atomic explosion .
Nothing weird about that as long as you do it in a meaningful way .

I 've smoked ten marijuana cigarettes in my life , and probably the last time I had one near my face was twelve , fifteen years ago .
And the reason I did was because , since I do smoke , people would say , " Here , smoke this , you 'll get high . "
So I smoked it , and it gave me a sore throat and made me sleepy .
And I must either presume that that 's what high means , or something was wrong .
But I 've never had a positive result from smoking marijuana .
It just was n't my cup of tea .
And I never used LSD , never used cocaine , never used heroin or any of that other stuff .

Bob Guccione , Jr. :
Do you think somewhere along the line , it serves the powers that be , the pervading government for the last 10 years , to have education dilapidate to where people do n't think enough to really challenge ?
Frank Zappa : No question .
I do n't think it's any accident that the educational system in America has been brought to its current state .
Because only a totally uneducated mass of people will be baffled by balloons .
And yellow ribbons and little flags and buzz words and guys saying " new world order " and shit like that , I mean , only a person who has been dissuaded from any kind of critical thinking and does n't know geography , does n't know the English language - I mean if you can't speak English , then this stuff works on you .
One of the things that was taken out of the curriculum was civics .
Civics was a class that used to be required before you could graduate from high school .
You were taught what was in the U.S. Constitution .
And after all the student rebellions in the '60s , civics was banished from the student curriculum and was replaced by something called social studies .
Here we live in a country that has a fabulous constitution and all these guarantees , a contract between the citizens and the government - nobody knows what 's in it .
It 's one of the best kept secrets .
And so , if you do n't know what your rights are , how can you stand up for them ?
And furthermore , if you do n't know what is in that document , how can you care if someone is shredding it ?

The lessons learnt in the '60s about merchandising stupidity to the American public on a large scale have been used over and over again since that time
Recorded 9 –12 March 1966 , released 5 December 2006
The '60s was really stupid …
It was a type of merchandising , Americans had this hideous weakness , they had this desire to be OK , fun guys and gals , and they have n't come to terms with the reality of the situation : we were not created equal .
Some people can do carpentry , some people can do mathematics , some people are brain surgeons and some people are winos and that 's the way it is , and we 're not all the same .
This concept of one world - ism , everything blended and smoothed out to this mediocre norm that everybody downgrades themselves to be is stupid .
The '60s was merchandised to the public at large ...
My pet theory about the '60s is that there is a sinister plot behind it ...

Politics is the entertainment division of the Military Industrial Complex .
Quote appearing widely on internet , but without reliable sourcing ; variants and possible origins discussed at : The Big Apple ( 10 October 2012 ) Variants : I say politics is the entertainment branch of industry , and government is what we need .
We have a diverse population in the United States , with all kinds of different needs that have to be taken care of .
That is the righteous function of government .
Politics is bullshit , basically .
Politics is involved with statesmanship .
And I do make a distinction between those things .
If you are making a political statement , remember , you are not addressing the real needs of government .
You are just talking about the Madison Avenue aspect .
So think about that difference .

Dick Cheney , despite his protestations of having " no ties " to Halliburton , may be one of the worst offenders , likely rising to level of treasonous activity .
As of 2005 , Cheney had 433,000 Halliburton options with varying strike prices as low as $ 28.13 a share .
Halliburton closed at $ 38.98 on Friday ( 10/5/2007 ) .
If you adjust the lowest strike price to account for a 2007 split , Cheney could buy shares for as little as $ 14.07 and sell them for almost $ 39 .
That 's $ 25 of profit per option exercised .
If Cheney gets his war with Iran , how much will his Halliburton options be worth then .
Iraq was never about WMDs or Democracy .
This administrations motivations could literally come down to one man 's stock options .
While tens of thousands of American soldiers are killed or wounded in Iraq , Cheney has set himself up to rake in tens of millions in war profits .

It would not have been possible to justify such largesse without a bogeyman to be dragged out whenever the population is roused by truth to suspicion .
In 1947 , the bogeyman was the specter of communism - a tactic urged upon President Harry Truman by GOP Senator Arthur Vandenburg .
The climate of fear is maintained by both parties but with less embarrassment by the GOP .
[ See : The Decline of the American Empire , Gore Vidal ]
In what Vidal called " a fit of conscience " never witnessed among modern Republicans , President Eisenhower warned us that such a Military / Industrial complex might establish permanent control over the state itself .
Fascism is not defined by the number of its victims , but by the way it kills them .

Terrorism can only be exploited in an atmosphere of irrational and endemic hatred .
Hatred is nurtured by a party that could not possibly exist without the various strawmen upon which it directs the bile and hatred of the American right wing - hatred of science , hatred of the humanities , especially art , literature , and most of all : philosophy .
Right wing hatred of philosophy is most certainly based upon its inherent distrust of critical thought itself .
The GOP finds the process of critical thinking subversive of its own inflexible , unquestioned dogma .
This is dogma that they would , of course , impose upon you in various and subtle ways .
It is a brave and rare person who dares think outside the box .
For grins , let 's factor out the GDP , the billions spent and the billions earned on the arts of war and those who enable it .
We are third world .
And for all that , we can thank the most absurd party of man 's creation : the GOP .
What matters - all that matters , really - is the will to happiness , a kind of enormous , ever - present consciousness .
The rest - women , art , success - is nothing but excuses .

Now , if Bush would expect us to believe that he 's actually read anything by an existentialist , let him begin by withdrawing American troops , however belatedly , out of Iraq .
According to Sylvester , he got out of his car and was surrounded by officers , at least two of whom were carrying automatic weapons .
Without warning , one officer fired a Taser into the back of his head which made him drop to his knees , he said .
A second shock caused him to fall on his face , breaking a front tooth .
A further six shocks made him wet himself and left him lying in the road in pain while the officers and sniffer dogs searched the car and found nothing .
The Independent Police Complaints Commission has started an investigation and David Lammy , Sylvester 's MP in Tottenham , north London , has written to Sir Ian Blair , the Metropolitan police commissioner , to say he is " deeply concerned " .
The incident was part of Operation Neon , a crackdown on guns on London 's streets by using armed response units to stop and search cars .
Sylvester said the incident had left him traumatised and he now suffered from short - term memory loss .
He doubts the police would have stopped him had he not been black .
A spokesman for the Met said : " Just after midnight , officers on an intelligence - led operation stopped a car in Bounces Road , N9 .
The driver got out of the vehicle and was subsequently Tasered .
Our information is the Taser was deployed once . "
Sylvester had been followed by police cars for about three miles through Tottenham before they boxed him in .
" Armed police jumped out and opened my car door , " he said .
" I said OK , I 'm coming .
I asked what was going on and as soon as I stepped out of the car I felt something touch me on the back of the head and then I was on my knees .
Then it happened again and I was on my face and I felt somebody pressing my head down with their foot .
By the fifth time I realised officers were pinning my arms together .
It was like they were trying to break my arms and I was in pain , screaming out .
" I was shocked eight times altogether and I had urinated on the floor .
It was like being tortured .
It went on and on and I felt they were going to kill me . "
According to guidelines set by the Home Office and the Association of Chief Police Officers , Tasers should be deployed " where officers are facing violence or threats of violence of such severity that they would need to use force to protect the public , themselves and / or the subject ( s ) of their action " .
Tasers have been used 47 times in London this year , with black people accounting for almost two - thirds of those stunned .
The government extended the right to use Tasers for all firearms officers in England and Wales this summer .

And so we are pushing back the boundaries of ice cream vending .
After a pub conversation where we wondered if people ate ice cream in Mongolia , we thought we might find out .
MONGOL RALLY
Teams have a month to get from London to Ulaanbaartar Vehicles have one - litre engine Started in 2001 as two friends tried and failed to get to Mongolia Second in 2004 when six teams attempted journey - four made it IN 2005 43 teams took part - 18 made it In 2006 167 cars took part - 118 made it This year there are 200 teams , all in vehicles with one litre engines
The Mongol Rally is a charity event limited to 200 teams and this year all the places were snapped up in under one minute .
Participants travel a third of the way around the world from London to the Mongolian capital of Ulaanbaatar , in about four weeks , in a vehicle with a one - litre engine or less .
Each team has to design their own route and , unsurprisingly , not all vehicles are expected to make it over the finishing line .
The principal charity for the Mongol Rally is Mercy Corps with the money raised funding projects in Mongolia that support rural communities .
Ten thousand miles of freezing mountains and scorching deserts - temperatures potentially hitting 50 °C and going as low as - 25 °C .
That 's 20 countries in 30 days and about one third of the way round the earth .
In an ice cream van .
Swales Yorkshire Dales ice cream gave us a fully functioning ice cream van and all the delicious ice cream we need to deliver along the way .
In the two weeks prior to departure we went up and down the country dealing out dairy ice cream from our mad van raising money for charity .
Not everybody will make it
Where to sleep in the van is a logistical nightmare in itself .
There would be plenty of room if we had no freezer , jerry cans , tyres and wafer cones , but as it is Alex has claimed the front seats , I am sleeping with the freezer in the back and Mike is outside in a tent .
Four days into our mission we do n't know how we are getting back from Mongolia - the van gets sold for charity once we arrive .
After getting 10 visas to enter some weird and wonderful countries - some of which , like Turkmenistan , did n't really want us to come , we forgot to get a double Russian or Chinese visa to get back out .
Mike was escorted out of the Kazakhstan Embassy in Prague .
They say it takes seven days but all it is is a stamp on paper .
Having left Hyde Park in London on Saturday , we have driven through the night to reach Prague by Monday , before all the competitors go their separate ways to Mongolia .
Already , we 've had some funny encounters .
Two days later , after passing through Slovakia , Hungary , Romania and Bulgaria we hit Turkey for a much - needed rest day .
Then on through Turkey to Georgia and Azerbaijan , where we catch a ferry to Turkmenistan .
We have a five - day Turkmenistan visa , no more , and we are in trouble if we are not out within this time .
IN THE VAN Ryan Walker : Automotive engineering graduate , favourite ice cream mint choc chunk Alex Welsh : Favourite ice cream chocolate Mike Hollaway : Weather forecaster , favourite ice cream cinder toffee crunch
We 're quite looking forward to getting into the off - road side of things .
But we do n't know how we are going to handle it with hills .
The van , with the ice cream and equipment , weighs an absolute ton .
It 'll do the downhills but going uphill may be different .
From there we pass into Uzbekistan to the great Silk Road city of Samarkand , before heading to the tiny mountainous country of Tajikistan .
From here we pass through one of the worlds highest roads at well over 3,000 meters through mined borders into Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan .
Then it is a long drive through to Russia before tackling the world 's least densely populated country of Mongolia to our finishing post in the capital , Ulaan Bataar .
As mentioned , along the way we will be giving our delicious dairy ice cream and we have become a dab hand at whipping up a " 99 - style " ice cream complete with flake and sprinkles in a matter of seconds to please passing kids and border guards alike .
As for chimes , we have an mp3 with Greensleeves and so on - although we also hope to entertain passing nomads with other classics such as Van Halens " Ice Cream Man " or " Ice Ice Baby " .
They should play Ice cream man by Jonathon Richman and the modern lovers .
" I love your chimes they reel and they rock "

But I love it !

This is a wonderful idea , obviously better than the Bush policy of invasion in the name of " war on terror " .
Instead of seeking non-existing " weapons of mass destruction ' this is a step towards " mass enjoyment " .
What can be so difficult or terrifying about delicious ice cream in a turbulent world ?
Just think how much ice cream we could send to the Middle East for the same money that the USA is wasting in the Iraq war .
Paul Gregg , Seymour , Wisconsin , United States
Please send that truck over to Houston , its 33 and 80 percent humidity , I 'm dying .
I would love a 99 now and a screwball .....
Dilip , Houston , Texas ( ex - pat )
I thought they were lactose - intolerant in Mongolia ?
Better rethink the whole " delivering dairy to Asia " plan , boys .
Mike Smith , Beverly Hills , Ca , USA
Sounds exciting .
wish you well and hope you get to finish up in good time .
I know the ice cream is sure to be a big hit with the kids you meet on your trip .
Salome , Accra Ghana
Completely hatstand but well done and I really hope they make it !!!
Darrel Coltrini , S. Devon
Such a stupid race can not be good for the environment .
But the increase in global temperature might be good for ice - cream sales .

Rudy Giuliani appeared on Meet the Press with Tim Russert yesterday and was asked about Huckabee ’s 1992 comments I posted about earlier .
Giuliani told Russert that it ’s acts that are sinful , not orientation , and he too is a sinner .
The remarks begin at about 3:45 in the clip above .
MSNBC transcript .
MR. RUSSERT : And we ’re back .
Our remaining minutes with Rudy Giuliani .
Mike Huckabee , leading the field in Iowa , told the Associated Press back in the ‘ 90s that AIDS patients should be quarantined and that “ homosexuality was aberrant , unnatural and a sinful lifestyle . ”
What ’s your reaction ?
MR. GIULIANI : My reaction is that I have n’t seen — on the second of that , I have n’t seen Mike ’s comment .
The first one I think he says that he did n’t have the information , that he ’s changed his mind about it , it ’s not his current position .
Look , I got enough of my own statements and issues , as we ’ve seen , that I have to deal with .
I think Mike has to …
MR. RUSSERT : But you do n’t believe homosexuality is aberrant …
MR. GIULIANI : Oh , no , no , no .
MR. RUSSERT : …unnatural or sinful .
MR. GIULIANI : My , my , my — no , I do n’t believe it ’s sinful .
My , my moral views on this come from the , you know , from the Catholic Church , and I believe that homosexuality , heterosexuality as a , as a way that somebody leads their life is not — is n’t sinful .
It ’s the acts , it ’s the various acts that people perform that are sinful , not the — not the orientation that they have .
MR. RUSSERT : The Congress is discussing and …
MR. GIULIANI : Which includes me , by the way .
I mean , you know , unfortunately , I ’ve had my own sins that I ’ve had to confess and had to deal with and try to overcome and so I ’m very , very empathetic with people , and that we ’re all , we ’re all imperfect human beings struggling to , to try to be better .
TUCSON , Ariz . -- Arizona basketball coach Lute Olson filed
for divorce from his second wife .
Olson filed a divorce petition in Pima County Superior Court on
Thursday , the same day the 73 - year - old coach said he would extend
his leave from the team through the end of the season , Olson's
lawyer , Leonard Karp , said Friday .
" The marriage has been irretrievably broken with no reasonable
prospect of reconciliation , " Karp said .
He said that Christine Olson is still living in Tucson but that
he did not know whether she would remain in the city .
He said he
did not know whether Lute Olson was in Tucson on Friday .
" His request basically was that people honor his privacy , "
said Karp , who added that he was authorized to speak on Olson's
behalf .
" He 's taken a lot of time to make this decision , " the attorney
said .
" I think he needs the time to resolve these matters .
Our
hope is that once Christine retains her attorney that we can sit down and amicably resolve things . "
Olson announced his leave Nov. 4 and said the reasons were
personal and not health - related .
Sources close to Olson have told ESPN.com 's Andy Katz that there are personal issues beyond the divorce that led to the leave of absence .
In a statement released by the university Thursday announcing
Olson 's leave extension , the Hall of Famer said he plans to return
to coach the Wildcats ( 5 - 2 ) for the 2008 - 09 season .
" There are personal issues within my family that need to be
addressed and I must devote my full energy to that , " Olson said in
the statement .
Karp said he did n't believe Olson would rescind his leave in
light of the divorce filing .
" I think his statement is his true feelings , that he will be
back next year but that he needs this time during this season to
resolve his personal problem , " Karp said .
Legal records supervisor Ray Rivas in the Superior Court clerk's
office said court rules bar public scrutiny of divorce petitions
until the filer 's spouse has been served or 45 days have passed .
The filing was first reported online by the Tucson Citizen and
the Arizona Daily Star .
" Our family has been struggling through a difficult and private matter for some months now , " Christine Olson said in a statement .
" It was our hope that during my husband 's temporary leave of absence , we would be able to focus on our family and successfully address this matter .
Unfortunately , it seems that my husband has reached a decision that he is unable to continue our relationship together during this difficult time .
" While I am personally devastated I remain committed to my marriage and will continue to support my husband through this difficult time in his life .
I have nothing but love and respect for him .
I want to thank everyone in advance for your support and prayers .
We request that the media please respect our family 's privacy at this time , " she said .
Athletic director Jim Livengood , in Chicago with the team , said : " There 's no comment from me .
It 's a personal family matter and
should be addressed appropriately . "
The Wildcats ( No. 24 ESPN / USA Today , No. 22 AP ) play Illinois on Saturday .
Olson has coached Arizona for 24 seasons and posted a 589 - 187
record with 23 consecutive NCAA Tournament appearances .
His
Wildcats have won 11 Pac - 10 championships , reached the Final Four
four times and won the 1997 NCAA title .
Assistant Kevin O'Neill , who is serving as interim coach while
Olson is gone , said Friday he wants Olson 's privacy respected .
He
said he 's doing the best he can to fill in for " someone who is
true greatness . "
" I have great respect and admiration for what our players have
done to this point in terms of focusing on basketball only in a
very difficult situation -- a situation that , really , there 's no
blueprint for , " O'Neill said .
Senior guard Jawann McClellan said the players want Olson back " 100 percent . "
" We wanted Coach Olson back more than anything , but first of
all , we want him to do well and take care of Coach Olson , "
McClellan said .
" A lot of people do n't realize that he 's still
human . "
Olson and his first wife , Bobbi , were married for 47 years
before her 2001 death from ovarian cancer after a 2 ½ - year fight .
The couple had five children .
She served an active role in Olson 's basketball program , joining
him on recruiting trips and even cooking pancakes for prospective
players when they came to visit Tucson .
Former players revered her
for being so instrumental in creating a family atmosphere .
The
university renamed the basketball court Lute & Bobbi Olson Court
after her death .
In April 2003 , Olson married Christine Jack Toretti -- a
prominent , politically active Pennsylvania businesswoman who is 22
years his junior .
Toretti , who took Olson 's last name after their wedding , remains
chief executive of an oil and gas drilling company and sits on
several corporate boards .
She has three sons from her first
marriage .
Information from The Associated Press was used in this report .
Nearly 500,000 Americans are abroad , defending our freedom as members of our armed forces .
In standing their post and protecting the rest of us back home , they make enormous sacrifices .
They live in tiny compartments aboard submarines and in tents on the gritty desert .
They spend months , even years , away from their families .
Some give up their lives in service of their nation .
Thanks to these brave men and women , those of us back home will head to our local polling places this November and exercise our foremost right  the right to vote .
But in an unconscionable systemic failure , too many of the men and women in our military will find it difficult to cast their vote and more difficult to have it counted , even though they are defending that right far from home .
Members of the military who are posted abroad must vote by absentee ballot in the state where they last lived before shipping out .
Every state has a system for distributing and counting these absentee ballots , and these systems feature a wide range of rules and requirements .
Usually , the process works something like this : A soldier abroad fills out an application for an absentee ballot and sends it to his local election official .
The official processes the application and mails a ballot to the soldier a few weeks before the election .
Once he receives it , the soldier must fill out his ballot and return it to the election official .
Usually , it must arrive by Election Day .
In some states , it may arrive up to two weeks later as long as it was postmarked or signed prior to Election Day .
A few states even require that absentee voters have the signature on their ballot notarized  a difficult task when voting from a temporary camp in Iraq .
Needless to say , problems abound .
The most critical of these is the shameful condition of the military postal system .
Mail from the United States to overseas military posts usually takes about three weeks .
Aside from being a disgraceful disservice to the troops , the lengthy delivery period for international military mail poses major problems for soldiers trying to vote because some states do not even distribute ballots until 30 days before Election Day .
This makes it virtually impossible for the overseas military voter to fill out the ballot and have it back to the proper election authority on time .
There are other problems : during the Florida recount after the 2000 Presidential election , many localities had trouble determining the date of postmark on military absentee ballots .
The dates were frequently illegible for one reason or another , so local election officials simply discarded the ballots .
Many military ballots were not signed or notarized .
Again , hundreds and perhaps thousands of military votes were excluded .
These problems only came to light in Florida as a result of the intense scrutiny prompted by various recounts , but the same sorts of difficulties permeate electoral systems across the country .
After the debacle in 2000 , the federal government mandated some absentee voting reforms , but they do n't go far enough .
In a recent letter to President Bush , Theresa M. Petrone , a Democratic member of Chicago 's Board of Elections , predicted that thousands of military absentee ballots would once again go uncounted .
Petrone asked that the federal government force states to count absentee ballots until 14 days after the election , provided that the ballot was signed by Election Day .
But this would require federal legislation , and there 's little chance of any legislative fix passing Congress in time .
Also , Petrone 's proposal would do nothing to address the problems with the military postal service .
According to the Associated Press , 30 percent of military voters who requested absentee ballots in 2000 did not receive them in time to have their vote counted .
In 2000 , roughly 250,000 military voters applied to vote absentee .
Now , with hundreds of thousands of additional troops posted in Iraq , Afghanistan and elsewhere , the number of military personnel interested in voting absentee is expected to soar .
Nearly 350,000 applications had already been requested as of mid-July .
The men and women protecting our nation deserve to have their votes counted , even if it means enduring a couple of weeks of uncertainty in tightly contested states .
It is incumbent on the Department of Defense ( DOD ) and the various state election authorities to ensure that they are .
DOD has already pledged that all military absentee ballots will be returned to the states via Express Mail at no cost to the troops , and this will help to some degree .
But the other fundamental problem remains with the states .
There is absolutely no reason that ballots cannot be mailed to overseas voters sooner than 30 days before an election .
Except in one or two states with very late primaries , the ballots are settled .
The states could , if they wished , begin mailing the ballots sooner .
At the same time , the states could , if they wished , extend their counting deadlines to ensure that military absentee ballots are counted .
Both of these steps should be taken quickly , in time to safeguard this fall 's election .
Longer term fixes are needed , too .
First , DOD must reform the reprehensible military postal system .
Second , states must codify sound but accommodating requirements for military absentee voters .
For now , we owe it to our men and women in uniform to see that their right to vote is protected , just as they protect our rights , including our right to make the trip to our polling place , through their service .
We should all be ashamed if there is even the slightest doubt that the votes of our men and women in uniform could somehow be cast aside through a series of problems of our own making .
Well , it finally arrived , the long - anticipated bump in Hillary Clinton ’s road to the nomination , the bump that many predicted would slow her down and give her competitors a chance to catch up .
Or did it ?
The media certainly thought so , and I do n’t mean just the conservative media that pounce eagerly on any sign that she is faltering , or fudging , or over - reaching , or peaking too soon , or engaging in shady practices .
( Unfortunately for the Fox - New York Post crowd , the Norman Hsu story does n’t seem to have legs . )
Everyone was writing her political obituary ten seconds after the last word was spoken in the October 29 debate .
Liberal hand - wringers , self - identified feminists , concerned “ old friends ” – they were all standing over the body and taking bets on whether or not it could be revived .
The other Democratic candidates were already piling on during the debate .
And in the days that followed they did more of the same .
Barack Obama just happened to be in the neighborhood when “ Saturday Night Live ” was doing its Halloween show and cleverly appeared as himself .
Whipping off his Barack Obama mask to reveal – you guessed it – Barack Obama , he said to the actress playing Hillary that he was always the same person no matter where he was and no matter what the company .
( Which means , I guess , that no matter where he is he always manages to say absolutely nothing in orotund and inspiring tones . )
An Edwards campaign commercial set to Strauss ’s “ Blue Danube Waltz ” showed a split screen with Hillary on both halves pronouncing on opposite sides of the same issue ( or so we were to believe ) .
And of course the Republicans waded in .
Rudy Giuliani did Hillary imitations , complete with mincing steps and effete hand gestures , looking just like the cross - dresser we know him to be .
Tucker Carlson whined that Hillary whined about getting beat up by an old boys club and harumphed that Obama , at least , did n’t ask people to stop attacking him because he was black .
When his guest replied that no one was attacking Obama while everyone was attacking Clinton , Carlson muttered something about everyone being the object of attack in a political campaign .
( A nice strategy : when the facts are n’t with you , rise above them . )
And what exactly did Clinton do to deserve all this ?
She answered a question posed by moderator ( in this case pit- bull ) Tim Russert of NBC : “ Governor of New York Eliot Spitzer has proposed giving driver ’s licenses to illegal immigrants .
You told the Nashua , New Hampshire , editorial board it makes a lot of sense .
Why does it make a lot of sense to give an illegal immigrant a driver ’s license ? ”
It is now set in cement that Clinton first said it did make sense and then said it did n’t .
( She was for it before she was against it . )
But that ’s not right .
She said that it did n’t make sense in the abstract – if the question is should illegal immigrants be given driver ’s licenses , perhaps just after they cross the border , the answer is obviously no – but given the federal government ’s failure to pass meaningful immigration reform , a governor who knows that many documented workers are driving on his state ’s roads might well think that it made sense to bring them within the state ’s ambit .
This is a position one could quarrel with , but it is coherent and not double - sided .
Of course , it did n’t come across that way and that ’s her fault .
She began her answer by talking about Spitzer ’s desire “ to fill the vacuum left by the failure of this administration to bring about comprehensive immigration reform . ”
But this is too vague ( what vacuum , exactly ? ) and seemed unresponsive .
What she should have done is said something like , “ To answer your question , it is necessary to ask another one : why has Governor Spitzer been driven to this desperate measure ?
What set of conditions has given him the unhappy choice between endangering the citizens of his state and legitimating illegal immigrants ? ”
With the context of Spitzer ’s proposal established , the question of whether or not it made sense would have been seen to be more complicated than Russert ’s formulation of it suggested .
( It would have been a better version of “ it depends what the meaning of ‘ is ’ is . ” )
She could have then proceeded in a straight line to make her point and protected herself from the accusation – made by John Edwards on the spot – that she was talking out of both sides of her mouth .
She was n’t .
It was a bad rap , although one she invited by failing to get the parts of her answers in the right order and thereby allowing her rivals to treat points that went together to form a whole as if they were separately , and inconsistently , made .
But maybe Clinton ’s real sin was giving an answer with parts .
Later , when she insisted that she “ did not say that it should be done ” ( “ should ” is a normative , universalizing word and she wanted to distance herself from it ) , Russert was n’t having any : “ Do you support his [ Spitzer ’s ] plan , ” he asked insistently .
She replied that his was a “ gotcha ” question , and it was .
It demanded either a yes or a no answer and therefore it was committed in advance to regarding any other answer – especially an answer with nuance – as waffling and equivocating .
Does it matter ?
Is this the banana peel she slips on ?
I think not .
On the same show that Chris Matthews was solemnly discussing how much damage this dust - up had done to the Clinton campaign , he was reporting continuing double - digit leads and announcing that his team of expert analysts had named her the likely nominee by a large margin .
A few columns back I made some predictions that provoked outrage : that Clinton would reach 50 percent in the national polls ; that fence - sitters would begin falling her way ( hello , Walter Mondale ) ; that she would begin pulling away in Iowa and New Hampshire .
All that has happened , and I now make another prediction : get ready to hear “ Hail to the Chieftess . ”
( Note : An earlier version of this column included the phrase “ Hobson ’s choice . ”
It has been changed to “ unhappy choice . ” )
Move over , Halliburton : Sara Lee , Perdue targeted over Iraq contracts RAW STORY
Published : Wednesday October 17 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This $ 2.3 million for lobster tails Justice Department and Pentagon investigators are probing whether Perdue , Sara Lee and ConAgra Foods overcharged the military in sweetened Iraq deals that the companies worked out with the help of former US military procurement officials they hired as consultants or executives .
The story was reported first in the Wall Street Journal Wednesday .
The Journal notes that the prices the firms charged the Pentagon were not extraordinarily high by normal standards .
But as wholesale prices , the deals appeared questionable and ran into the hundreds of millions of dollars .
The inquiry seeks to ascertain whether the firms charged the US Army 's primary food contractor in Kuwait marked up prices and whether the Kuwaiti firm , Public Warehousing , received kickbacks from the suppliers .
" Public Warehousing 's dealings are the subject of ' a very large and active investigation into criminal and civil fraud involving amounts in the hundreds of millions of dollars , ' Justice Department lawyer Brian Mizoguchi told a judge in Federal Claims Court in Washington , D.C. , on June 12 , " according to the Journal .
" Public Warehousing , which receives more than $ 1 billion annually to feed troops in Iraq and Kuwait , denies wrongdoing . "
Investigators are also focused on the role Army officials played in picking the US companies that fed the Army 's distribution arm .
Military contracts typically pay the cost of the goods they receive plus a profit margin , the article says , thereby having an explicit means to determine whether they are being overcharged .
" Details of the Kuwait transactions and the federal probe are spelled out in hundreds of pages of court documents , emails , spreadsheets and military files seen by The Wall Street Journal , " the paper said .
" Among other things , the records show that Sara Lee paid 5 % of the purchase price back to Public Warehousing for meat and bakery orders to feed U.S. troops in Iraq and Kuwait .
The agreement was negotiated by a Sara Lee executive in charge of military sales , Paul Simmons , who formerly served as a chief warrant officer for the Army .
Mr. Simmons declined to comment . "
One figure in the probe is David Staples , a Sara Lee sausage executive - cum - Army procurement official .
His posting appears to illustrate the seemingly transparent wall between the private and public sector .
In an interview with the Journal , Staples denied the claims .
" We follow standard business practices , " he said .
Remarked a spokesman for Sara Lee : " Sara Lee was subpoenaed , and has cooperated fully with the Department of Defense 's investigation . "
According to the piece , procurement officials shut out Tyson Foods out of the bidding , favoring other firms to supply the Army 's distributor .
In an April 2007 letter to the Pentagon , a Tyson lawyer complained that firms employing former military personnel were receiving preferential treatment .
In all , the Army pays roughly $ 3.0 million a month for beef steaks , $ 2.7 million for chicken wings , $ 2.4 million for lobster tails and $ 744,000 for egg rolls .

Verizon is one of the phone companies currently being sued over its alleged disclosure of customer phone records to the NSA .
In a response to the court last week , the company asked for the entire consolidated case against it to be thrown out — on free speech grounds .
The response also alleges that the case should be thrown out because even looking into the issue could violate state secrets , of course , but a much longer section of the response tries to make the case that Verizon has a First Amendment right to " petition " the government .
" Based on plaintiffs ' own allegations , defendants ' right to communicate such information to the government is fully protected by the Free Speech and Petition Clauses of the First Amendment , " argue Verizon 's lawyers .
Essentially , the argument is that turning over truthful information to the government is free speech , and the EFF and ACLU can't do anything about it .
In fact , Verizon basically argues that the entire lawsuit is a giant SLAPP ( Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation ) suit , and that the case is an attempt to deter the company from exercising its First Amendment right to turn over customer calling information to government security services .
" Communicating facts to the government is protected petitioning activity , " says the response , even when the communication of those facts would normally be illegal or would violate a company 's owner promises to its customers .
Verizon argues that , if the EFF and other groups have concerns about customer call records , the only proper remedy " is to impose restrictions on the government , not on the speaker 's right to communicate . "
With all of the phone company cases consolidated into one master case , Verizon is hoping to have the case thrown out on free - speech grounds , putting an end to its legal troubles over the issue .
Should it fail , the Bush administration is already preparing to ask Congress for retroactive immunity for all telecommunications companies that assisted the government after September 11 , 2001 .
The government is also fighting hard in court on behalf of the phone companies , filing repeated briefs which claim that " state secrets " trump even the legality of the alleged security programs .

In today 's New York Post , conservative columnist John Podhoretz offered some free advice to Democrats :
In pursuit of a short - term political benefit , Democrats are in danger of establishing a ruinous new standard in American politics - one they 'll come to regret and rue when they take the White House again .
. . .
By inflating the dismissal of eight U.S. attorneys into a major political scandal with the suggestion that the act of dismissing them is a scandal demanding congressional oversight , they 're creating a new political reality .
. . .
The longer this goes on , the easier it will be for pseudoscandals to be ginned up in the future whenever a certain type of official working in the executive branch is removed from his job .
Ah yes , Democrats will surely rue the day they created this " new political reality " where " pseudoscandals " can be " ginned up " by their political opponents .
Was Podhoretz in a coma during the entire Clinton administration ?
The " political reality " during the 1990s was that just about anything the Clinton administration did , no matter how routine or unremarkable , was considered scandalous by Republicans in Congress , who would immediately convene hearings , issue subpoenas , and demand the appointment of an independent counsel .
In fact , that 's exactly what happened in 1993 when Clinton made the routine decision to replace all the Republican U.S. Attorneys appointed by his predecessors .
That decision triggered nearly universal Republican condemnation and calls for hearings ( and it did n't stop Bush from doing the same thing when he took office ) .
So it is almost comically absurd for Podhoretz to suggest that what the Democrats are doing now will somehow come back to bite them during a future Democratic administration .
Even if they were to drop this issue entirely , it would not stop Republicans from attacking future Democratic administrations for conduct that is far less scandalous .
As was made perfectly clear during the 1990s , most Republicans are simply impervious to charges of hypocrisy .
They will attack Democratic administrations for doing things that Republican administrations routinely do .
In other words , when a Democrat sits in the White House , the threshold for what constitutes a " scandal " will invariably be set ridiculously low and will have absolutely nothing to do with past precedent .
If the Democrats in Congress right now were to back off this scandal in the hope that Republicans might extend them the same courtesy in some future Democratic administration , that would be the height of foolishness .
Republicans do n't calibrate their scandal antennae based on what they 've said or done in the past .
Moreover , this supposed presidential prerogative to fire prosecutors for any and all reasons , no matter how petty or crassly political , is something that every other president in modern times has managed to serve out their terms without exercising .
So even if the Democrats were to set a " new standard " here , it is one they should have little trouble living up to .
It 's really not that hard to refrain from firing your own hand - picked prosecutors for blatantly partisan reasons .
Finally , and perhaps most obviously , people like John Podhoretz do n't have the best interests of the Democratic party in mind .
He 's the quintessential " concern troll , " feigning concern over the precedent being set here in an effort to obscure what actually happened and avoid defending the Bush administration 's conduct on the merits .
If the Democrats were genuinely in danger of overreaching on this issue , Podhoretz would be silently cheering them on .
Though Podhoretz and his right - wing pundit brethren will never admit it , this is a genuine scandal , and it is very unlikely that the Democrats will pay any political price , either in the present or future , for demanding that the Bush administration answer some very basic questions about how the Justice Department operates .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Democratic front - runner Hillary Clinton trails five top Republican presidential contenders in general election match - ups , a drop in support from this summer , according to a poll released on Monday .

Clinton ’s top Democratic rivals , Barack Obama and John Edwards , still lead Republicans in hypothetical match - ups ahead of the November 4 , 2008 , presidential election , the survey by Zogby Interactive showed .
Clinton , a New York senator who has been at the top of the Democratic pack in national polls in the 2008 race , trails Republican candidates Rudy Giuliani , Mitt Romney , Fred Thompson , John McCain and Mike Huckabee by three to five percentage points in the direct matches .
In July , Clinton narrowly led McCain , an Arizona senator , and held a five - point lead over former New York Mayor Giuliani , a six - point lead over former Tennessee Sen.
Thompson and a 10 - point lead over former Massachusetts Gov. Romney .
She was not matched against the fast - rising Huckabee , a former Arkansas governor , in the July poll .
The results come as other national polls show the race for the Democratic nomination tightening five weeks before the first contest in Iowa , which kicks off the state - by - state nomination battles in each party .
Some Democrats have expressed concerns about the former first lady ’s electability in a race against Republicans .
The survey showed Clinton not performing as well as Obama and Edwards among independents and younger voters , pollster John Zogby said .
“ The questions about her electability have always been there , but as we get close this suggests that is a problem , ” Zogby said .
Obama , an Illinois senator , and Edwards , a former North Carolina senator , both hold narrow leads over the Republican contenders in the hypothetical 2008 match - ups .
“ It all points to a very competitive general election at a time when many people think the Democrats are going to win the White House , ” Zogby said .
The poll of 9,355 people had a margin of error of plus or minus one percentage point .
The interactive poll surveys individuals who have registered to take part in online polls .

“ WIN some , lose some ” , says a top Lithuanian politician of the looming disasters in Iraq and Afghanistan .
“ We were there for America .
America will be there for us ” .
That sort of breezy Atlanticism is almost extinct in western Europe .
And even among the east Europeans , it conceals a sinking feeling that they are going to suffer big collateral damage from America 's misguided strategies in the ill - named “ war on terror ” .
For a start , the crude division of Europe into “ old ” ( anti-American ) and “ new ” ( Atlanticist ) has hardly helped the still - shaky cause of reuniting the continent .
The disproportionate presence of largely token ex-communist forces in the “ coalition of the willing ” has helped confirm the cynical chancelleries of old Europe in their view that the new democracies are gullible American patsies .
The implication of Romania , Poland and perhaps some other countries in the renditions scandal has blemished what should have been the new democracies ' strongest card : their commitment to human rights .
How could those who had suffered in communist prisons collaborate now in the torture of other prisoners ?
The allegation may be outrageously unfair .
But it has stuck in the minds of many .
The damage goes on .
America 's role as guarantor of Europe 's security has been weakened .
In western Europe , revulsion at the bloody and incompetent occupation of Iraq , coupled with a mixture of astonishing amnesia and lazy prejudice , has wiped away a shared history that stretches from the Normandy beaches to the end of the Berlin Wall .
In western Europe , revulsion at the bloody and incompetent occupation of Iraq has wiped away a shared history that stretches from the Normandy beaches to the end of the Berlin Wall
Even in the new democracies , America 's standing has fallen .
The cost and hassle of getting an American visa grates maddeningly .
Polish and Estonian boys who fight side - by - side with Americans in Iraq are liable to be treated as potential terrorists and illegal immigrants when they want to visit .
The administration has moved shamefully slowly on this injustice , and on military assistance to its eager allies .
Yet , if the Atlantic bonds do weaken , the ex-captive nations will suffer the most .
It was America that got them into NATO , and it is America that looks out for them now , much more so than nearer but less friendly countries such as Germany .
Any suggestion that the east Europeans can rely on the European Union to stick up for them against Russian bullying is , on current form , laughable .
New radar gear and rocket interceptors planned for the Czech Republic and ( probably )
Poland will probably not do much to change this ,
You do not strengthen an alliance by pressing on your allies weapons that their public does not want .
Helmut Schmidt , Germany 's chancellor 20 years ago , thought that having cruise and Pershing missiles in western Europe would make America 's nuclear guarantee more credible .
Instead , it cast America as the warmonger in the minds of the muddle - headed , and stoked peacenikery throughout Europe .
Barring an unlikely success in Afghanistan or Iraq , the strains on the Atlantic alliance will grow in the years ahead .
The rivets have long been popping .
Now great girders , such as Italy , are twisting and buckling .
It was public anti-Americanism that brought down Romano Prodi 's government last week .
Old Kremlin hands who remember how hard they once tried to destroy NATO must have trouble believing that the job is being done so well for them now by the alliance 's own leaders .
Yesterday , I spent much of the day assembling a propane grill given to us as a housewarming gift .
It was a fun project , but along the way I began to wonder exactly how cost - effective propane grilling actually is .
In this comparison , I ’m going to exclude the cost of the appliances themselves , though over the long haul they would roughly balance out .
My grill puts out 36,000 BTUs per hour – when you see the BTU measurement on the box , it refers to how many British Thermal Units the grill can produce in one hour .
A gallon of propane contains 91,600 BTUs , and a standard 20 pound tank has 4.72 gallons of propane in it for a total of 431,613 BTUs of energy .
Thus , one tank will allow the grill to run for twelve hours .
Given the cooking time I ’ve witnessed with the grill , most of our family meats will require an average of about 35 minutes of grill time , which means that I ’ll be able to grill about twenty times on a single tank .
As I can get a tank refill for $ 12 at the local hardware store , it costs about sixty cents per grilling session in propane costs .
This , of course , assumes that I fire up all three burners , which each consume about 12,000 BTUs per hour .
If I grill with just two of them ( likely , so I have a cooler spot on the grill ) , my cost per grilling session goes down to about forty cents .
This is just an estimate – I am not intimately familiar with cooking on the grill and I was doing some experimenting during my first uses .
On the other hand , using our electric range and cooking things in a skillet eats about 800 watts and takes , say , twenty minutes to cook a hamburger .
At that rate , the energy use costs about three cents .
On the other hand , preparing baked fish in the oven ( about 5000 watts for twenty minutes ) eats up about seventeen cents on the ol’ electric bill .
Clearly , using an internal electric stove is more cost - efficient than using a propane grill , though neither is particularly expensive .
It does , however , encourage healthier food preparation ( much of the fat drips right out of the meat onto the fat catcher ) and the taste can be tremendous ( you ca n’t get that kind of heating from a skillet on the oven ) .
Is it worth it ?
It depends entirely on the meal .
Many meat preparations are healthier on the grill than in the skillet and also many meats are substantially tastier when grilled due to the vastly different heat environment on a propane grill .
Is it worth that extra twenty to forty cents a meal ?
It certainly is to me .
Now , if we ’re talking extra tasty , I would like to eventually have a grilling pit where I could grill over wood and then use various woods to contribute subtle flavors to the meat … but that ’s a topic for my long - dreamed - about cooking blog .
Mobile Labs to Target Iraqis for Death
COMMENTARY : Mobile Labs to Target Iraqis for Death by Robert Parry U.S. forces in Iraq soon will be equipped with high - tech equipment that will let them process an Iraqi ’s biometric data in minutes and help American soldiers decide whether they should execute the person or not , according to its inventor .
" A war fighter needs to know one of three things :
Do I let him go ?
Keep him ?
Or shoot him on the spot ? ” Pentagon weapons designer Anh Duong told the Washington Post for a feature on how this 47 - year - old former Vietnamese refugee and mother of four rose to become a top U.S. bomb - maker .
Though Duong is best known for designing high - explosives used to destroy hardened targets , she also supervised the Joint Expeditionary Forensics Facilities project , known as a “ lab in a box ” for analyzing biometric data , such as iris scans and fingerprints , that have been collected on more than one million Iraqis .
The labs – collapsible , 20 - by - 20 - foot units each with a generator and a satellite link to a biometric data base in West Virginia – will let U.S. forces cross-check data in the field against information collected previously that can be used to identify insurgents .
These labs are expected to be deployed across Iraq in early 2008 .
Duong said the next step will be to shrink the lab to the size of a “ backpack ” so soldiers who encounter a suspect “ could find out within minutes ” if he ’s on a terrorist watch list and should be killed .
Duong justified this biometric - data program as a humanitarian way of singling out “ bad guys ” for elimination while sparing innocent civilians .
" I do n't want My Lai in Iraq , " Duong said .
" The biggest difficulty in the global war on terror – just like in Vietnam – is to know who the bad guys are .
How do we make sure we do n't kill innocents ? "
In Iraq and Afghanistan , U.S. military units already are operating under loose rules of engagement that allow them to kill individuals who are identified as suspected terrorists or who show the slightest evidence of being insurgents .
American forces also have rounded up tens of thousands of Iraqi military - age males , or MAMs , for detention .
During a summer 2007 trip to Iraq , Anthony Cordesman , a military analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies , was briefed on U.S. plans to expand the number of Iraqis in American detention by the end of 2008 .
“ The detainees have risen to over 18,000 and are projected to hit 30,000 ( by the U.S. command ) by the end of the year and 50,000 by the end of 2008 , ” Cordesman wrote in his trip report .
The sweeps have enabled the U.S. military to collect biometric data for future use if and when the Iraqis are released back into the general population .
Test Tube
In effect , the Bush administration is transforming Iraq into a test tube for modern techniques of repression , which already include use of night - vision optics on drone aircraft , heat resonance imaging , and firepower that is both deadly and precise .
The new techniques represent a modernization of tactics used in other counterinsurgencies , such as in Vietnam in the 1960s and in Central America in the 1980s .
In Vietnam , U.S. forces planted sensors along infiltration routes for targeting bombing runs against North Vietnamese troops .
In Guatemala , security forces were equipped with early laptop computers for use in identifying suspected subversives who would be dragged off buses and summarily executed .
Now , modern technologies are updating these strategies for the 21st century ’s “ war on terror . ”
The U.S. news media mostly has reacted to these developments with gee - whiz enthusiasm , like the Post story about Duong , which breezily depicts her complicated life as a devoted mom whose personal history as a Vietnamese refugee led her to a career developing sophisticated weapons for the U.S. government .
The Post feature article expressed no alarm and no criticism of Duong ’s comment about shooting Iraqi suspects “ on the spot . ” [ Washington Post , Dec. 1 , 2007 ]
Similarly , U.S. newspapers have consigned stories about U.S. troops engaging in extrajudicial killings of suspects mostly to pages deep inside the newspapers or have covered the news sympathetically .
While some harsh criticism has fallen on trigger - happy Blackwater “ security contractors , ” U.S. troops have been given largely a free pass .
For instance , no furor arose this fall when the U.S. military , in effect , endorsed claims by members of elite Army sniper units that they have been granted broad discretion in killing any Iraqi who crosses the path of their rifle scopes .
On Nov. 8 , a U.S. military jury at Camp Liberty in Iraq acquitted the leader of an Army sniper team in the killings of three Iraqi men south of Baghdad during the early days of the troop “ surge ” this year .
Staff Sgt. Michael Hensley was found not guilty of murder , though he was convicted of lesser charges that he had planted an AK - 47 rifle on one of the dead men and had shown disrespect to a superior officer .
In an e-mail interview with the New York Times , Hensley complained that he should not have even faced a court martial because he was following guidance from two superior officers who wanted him to boost the unit ’s kill count .
“ Every last man we killed was a confirmed terrorist , ” Hensley wrote .
“ We were praised when bad guys died .
We were upbraided when bad guys did not die . ”
[ NYT , Nov. 9 , 2007 ] Asymmetric Warfare
The case of Army sniper Jorge G. Sandoval Jr. , who served under Hensley , also revealed a classified program in which the Pentagon ’s Asymmetric Warfare Group encouraged U.S. military snipers in Iraq to drop “ bait ” – such as electrical cords and ammunition – and then shoot Iraqis who pick up the items , according to evidence in the Sandoval case .
[ Washington Post , Sept. 24 , 2007 ]
( Like Hensley , Sandoval was acquitted of murder but convicted of a lesser charge , the planting of copper wire on one of the slain Iraqis to make it look as if the dead man were involved in making explosive devices . )
Another case of a targeted killing of a suspected insurgent surfaced at a military court hearing at Fort Bragg , North Carolina , in mid-September .
Two U.S. Special Forces soldiers took part in the execution of an Afghani who was suspected of heading an insurgent group .
As described at the hearing , Staffel and Anderson were leading a team of Afghan soldiers when an informant told them where a suspected insurgent leader was hiding .
The U.S. - led contingent found a man believed to be Nawab Buntangyar walking outside his compound near the village of Hasan Kheyl .
While the Americans kept their distance out of fear the suspect might be wearing a suicide vest , the man was questioned about his name and the Americans checked his description against a list from the Combined Joint Special Operations Task Force Afghanistan , known as “ the kill - or - capture list . ”
Concluding that the man was insurgent leader Nawab Buntangyar , Staffel gave the order to shoot , and Anderson – from a distance of about 100 yards away – fired a bullet through the man ’s head , killing him instantly .
The soldiers viewed the killing as “ a textbook example of a classified mission completed in accordance with the American rules of engagement , ” the International Herald Tribune reported .
“ The men said such rules allowed them to kill Buntangyar , whom the American military had designated a terrorist cell leader , once they positively identified him . ”
[ IHT , Sept. 17 , 2007 ]
According to evidence at the Fort Bragg proceedings , an earlier Army investigation had cleared the two soldiers because they had been operating under “ rules of engagement ” that empowered them to kill individuals who have been designated “ enemy combatants , ” even if the targets were unarmed and presented no visible threat .
In effect , Duong ’s mobile labs would streamline the process for identifying suspected insurgents like Buntangyar .
Rather than relying on physical descriptions , U.S. forces could scan a suspect ’s eyes or check his fingerprints -- and instantaneously cross-check it with data stored in West Virginia -- before deciding , in Duong ’s words , " Do I let him go ?
Keep him ?
Or shoot him on the spot ? ”

Bonhomie does not a policy make :
Sarkozy ’s agenda is “ to the left of Kucinich ”
One of the reasons I know I ’m doing something right on this web site is the fact that I ’m lucky enough to have Bernard Chazelle as a frequent reader of and commentator on my postings , be they on matters Middle Eastern or the state of European football .
A Princeton computer science professor , Bernard is an unfailingly erudite commentator with spectacularly diverse interests and fascinating insights — check out his personal page — and when I recently waded , rather ignorantly , into the minefield of French politics , he set me straight on a few questions .
Now that Nicolas Sarkozy is the new president — and is being claimed in the U.S. media as being as pro-American as Chirac was ostensibly anti- —
I invited Bernard to offer us some insights on what we should really expect to change in France as a result of a Sarko presidency .
Bernard elegantly shreds the mainstream media picture of “ France in decline , ” but at the same time skewers the received notion of Sarkozy as an anti-immigrant vigilante or a Gallic Tony Blair .
I ’m delighted to welcome Bernard in what I hope will be the first of many guest appearances on Rootless Cosmopolitan
Why Sarkozy Will Disappoint the White House
by Bernard Chazelle
The story has been all over the media : Nicolas Sarkozy might not be an easy man to like but France is the “ sick man of Europe ” and tough love is what it needs .
If its new president ’s odes to the liberating power of work
and paeons to “ the France that gets up early ” grate on the ears of his 35 - hour - work - week nation , so be it .
Yeah , yeah , Sarko made few friends in the riot - prone banlieues when he called the locals “ scum ” and threatened to clean up the projects with a Kärcher power hose ( a German brand , no less ) .
But at least he promised them jobs and not more empty socialist rhetoric .
Having missed the train of globalization , the French economy is collapsing under the strain of a creaky welfare system and a chronic incapacity to create jobs .
By rejecting the neoliberal creed , France has turned its back on modernity .
Aware of its decline , the nation pines for its lost grandeur , a risible notion so quintessentially Gallic English does n’t even have a word for it .
The pro-US , pro-Israel , tax - cutting , union - busting Sarko is France ’s best hope for breaking with the gloomy years of the past .
Nice story .
Too bad it bears so little connection to reality .
France faces serious problems but they are none of the above .
Oddly , to get the country all wrong seems a bit of an art form in the U.S. media .
On any given day , Tom Friedman can be found berating the French for “ trying to preserve a 35 - hour work week in a world where Indian engineers are ready to work a 35 - hour day . ”
Friedman ’s genius is to suppress in the reader the commonsense reaction — Indian engineers have no life — and improbably redirect the pity toward the French .
That takes some skill .
‘ French decline ’ by the numbers
With the highest birth rate in Europe after Ireland , France contributes 70 % of Europe ’s natural population growth .
GDP per head in France , Germany , Japan , and the UK are nearly identical .
Growth over the last 10 years has averaged 2 % in france , 2.1 % in the U.S. , and 2.3 % in the UK .
In the last quarter , France actually raced ahead of Britain and the U.S. Productivity is higher in France than in both countries ( and 50 % more so than in Japan ) .
But pity the French : with their 35 - hour work week , 5 - week paid vacations , and 16 - week paid maternity leaves , they work 30 % fewer hours than Americans .
Maybe that ’s why they live longer ( 81 years vs 78 ) and infant mortality is lower ( 4.3 vs 7 per 1000 ) .
Unless the reason is France ’s health care system : the best in the world , according to the World Health Organization .
Or perhaps it ’s the narrower inequality gap : child poverty in France is half the British rate and one third the American .
“ French decline ” experts like to contrast France ’s catastrophic unemployment rate of 8.3 % ( lower than the U.S. rate during the Reagan years ) with Britain ’s marvellous 5.5 % .
In the process they miss two points : First ,
France created more jobs than the UK in the last 10 years .
( The discrepancy comes from the fact that France is younger and has experienced higher labor force growth ) .
Second , virtually all of the job growth in the UK since 2000 has been the result of public spending .
The neoliberals who so admire Britain ’s recent growth
conveniently forget that it was built on a Keynesian binge through tax increases and a huge public sector expansion : from 37 % to 46 % of GDP in a mere 6 years .
Gordon Brown at the Exchequer has , indeed , looked much the part of a French finance minister with a London office .
José Bové , the Astérix of French politics , has burnished France ’s antiglobalisation
image by ransacking McDonald ’s outlets wherever he can find enough TV cameras to capture his exploits .
But while France has been noisily scoffing at globalization for decades , it has quietly become one of the most globalized nations on earth .
( Reform by stealth is a French disease . )
Some of the evidence :
France has more companies listed in the Fortune Global 500 than
Britain and Germany ;
for the last 10 years , France ’s net foreign investments ( FDI ) have ranked in the top 5 ,
and its net FDI outflows have been the world ’s largest ;
foreign investors own 45 % of all French stocks .
The comparable
figure is 33 % for Britain ’s and only 10 % for the US .
What , then , is wrong with France ?
Simply put , the French system serves the interests of two - thirds of the population ( the insiders ) .
The outsiders ( the young and the old ) have been knocking at the door for 40 years .
The sons and daughters of North - African immigrants have paid the highest price .
While a few might be seeking a new Muslim identity , which their parents shunned , the overwhelming majority of them have no greater desire than to integrate into secular French society .
Savor the irony : the only practicing Muslim on the French national soccer team , Franck Ribéry , is a white Christian who converted to Islam .
Integration has failed but the battle is not lost .
Half of all immigrant couples are racially mixed and a quarter of all French women of Algerian descent marry non-Muslims .
( By comparison , only 2 to 4 percent of African - American women marry outside their race
and 5 percent of Britain ’s South - Asian women do so . )
The crisis of the projects is France ’s biggest challenge in the years ahead .
The problem is rooted in the twin evil of racism and the insiders ’ fierce defense of the status quo .
Sarkozy ’s presidency will succeed or fail on his ability to break the door open to let the outsiders in ,
and create jobs for the unemployed youths .
Sarkozy is blessed with all the attributes of a successful politician , including a unique gift for being a jerk .
In the back alleys of the banlieues , France ’s former top cop comes off as just another white racist thug .
Soccer star Lilian
Thuram might well be right that “ Sarkozy stirs up people ’s latent racism , ” but as to being a racist himself the evidence is thin .
Sarko actually never used the word “ scum . ”
An exasperated resident of the projects asked him when he would rid them of the racaille ( wrongly translated as scum ; it means
rabble ) and he repeated her plea in the affirmative .
Likewise , “ I ’ll clean up the place with a power hose ” were the angry words Sarkozy spoke to the parents of an 11 - year old boy who had just been killed in a gang shootout — hardly Hitler addressing the 1927 Nuremberg rally .
However , Sarko ’s open admiration for the rancid views of my former Ecole Polytechnique colleague , Alain Finkielkraut , makes one wonder .
One of the “ new philosophers , ” he is the French Niall Ferguson , who goes whining to Haaretz that “ In France … we no longer teach that the colonial project sought … to bring civilization to the savages . ”
On a personal note , I can never forgive Mitterrand for intentionally boosting Le Pen ’s fortunes at the ballot box
in a Machiavellian divide - and - rule strategy .
On the other hand , as someone who did not vote for Sarko ,
I am still grateful to him for dealing Le Pen his biggest electoral blow .
I also note that while other politicians regurgitate the same tired “ solutions ” to the crisis of the banlieues — namely , building more community centers named after great poets —
Sarko has suggested somewhat more adventurous ideas ,
such as a restructuring of labor relations , a more flexible labor market , hiring incentives , and even that big French bugaboo , affirmative action , all the while reaffirming France ’s traditional rejection of communautarisme .
But he is a figure of hate among minorities and , unless he can repair his image and build bridges , he will not accomplish much .
The issue of ethnic integration towers above all others .
The future of France hangs in the balance .
Jacques Chirac , the friendliest and most ineffective French president in memory ,
spoke endlessly about solidarity but never did a thing about it .
Sarkozy has a mandate : 32 % of France voted for him ; by comparison , only 15 % of the U.S. voted for Clinton in ’ 92 .
His ideas might well fail but he ’s earned the right to try them out .
His success on integration will be the ultimate test .
Who is Nicolas Sarkozy ?
Unlike Chirac , Sarko is a true man of the right .
Being France , of course , that still puts his agenda , though not necessarily his character , to the left of Kucinich .
But he faces a French left that , unlike its American version ,
lost the battles but won the war .
France typically elects rightwing presidents to implement leftwing policies .
The consummate pragmatist , Sarko will not fight his battles on ideological grounds .
In anticipation of the social unrest that is sure to greet his reform of labor laws , he intends to use his ( likely ) new majority in parliament
to pass a minimum service public transportation law to dull the effect of transit strikes .
Sarko is the shrewdest French politician of his generation : a coopting master .
Commentators who wrongly see significance in his mixed Hungarian / Greek / Jewish background seem unaware that France is the most ethnically mixed country in Europe : 20 % of the population has a foreign parent or grandparent ; and the density of foreign - born , the highest in Europe , is similar to that of the United States .
In that regard , Sarko is the textbook French success story .
What is highly significant , however , is that
he did not graduate from ENA , the breeding ground of French politicians .
This gives him the independent streak to , say , staff half of his cabinet with women , as is his stated intention , without thinking twice about it .
What foreign policy ?
His likely selection of Bernard Kouchner as foreign minister is a master stroke .
The highly popular founder of the Nobel - prize winning Doctors Without Borders is a former Communist who worked for Mitterrand , campaigned for Ségolène Royal , and , as the chief advocate of the wooly concept of “ droit d’ingérence ” ( right of humanitarian intervention ) , played Bush ’s useful idiot in the run-up to the Iraq war .
His selection is a canny way to please , annoy , and confuse everyone all at once .
French foreign policy is framed within a “ Gaullist consensus ” that has been remarkably consistent over the years .
On the European front , Germany will remain France ’s only indispensable partner .
Merkel ’s first foreign trip was to the Elysée Palace .
Sarkozy returned the favor on Inauguration Day .
London ’s hopes for a weakening of the Paris - Berlin axis will once again be frustrated .
The axis will put the final nail in the coffin of Turkey ’s EU admission , to the chagrin of Britain and the U.S.
This will be made all the easier by troublesome new members like Poland , who offer daily reminders to the growing legions of Eurosceptics that the EU is already too big and the last thing it needs is the addition of an impoverished Muslim nation that would soon be its largest member .
Sarko and Brown will lower Merkel ’s ambition for a new European constitution and they ’ll all agree on a referendum - free slimline treaty .
True to his faith in industrial policy ( which seems to have escaped the eagle eyes of his neoliberal admirers stateside ) , Sarko will strong - arm the European Central Bank into putting downward pressure on the Euro .
He will fail .
Sarkozy ’s pious words about changing France ’s ( shameful ) neocolonial position in sub-Saharan Africa will come to naught .
France ’s chasse guardée will remain well guarded .
His proposed Mediterranean union is a different story .
France is the strongest power in the Mediterranean rim and it ’s a mystery why no Gaullist leader had yet thought of making a move in that direction .
Actually , Chirac did : he signed on to the 1995 EU Barcelona Initiative , but the EU ’s focus on eastward expansion and the NAFTA - esque imbalances of the project led it to its current vegetative state .
Except for Turkey , which will regard Sarko ’s Mediterranean initiative as yet another “ nail in the coffin ” ( see above ) , the reaction in the region will be globally positive .
Even Israel might take a shine to it .
The U.S. would be wise to support it , but it ’s unclear it will .
Regarding Russia , Sarko will follow Merkel ’s lead in being firm with Moscow but opposed to an aggressive stand by the U.S.
The neocons ’ push for a new cold war meant to reverse America ’s declining superpower status , which is what the missile shields in Central Europe are all about , will be strongly resisted .
France ’s interests in the Levant coincide with America’s .
Methods have differed in the past but , after the fiascos of the Iraq and Lebanon wars , they will increasingly converge .
Sarko ’s take on Syria wo n’t be as personal as Chirac ’s ( who never forgave Bashar ’s goons for killing his buddy Hariri ) but he will work to contain Syrian and Iranian influences .
Paris will see eye - to - eye with Washington about Hezbollah and will bark alongside against Iran ’s nuclear intentions while opposing military action .
The French policy in Iraq ?
There is none .
France has no policy about Dante ’s lower rings of hell .
Sarko will initiate a rapprochement with Israel .
Given the dysfunctional state of Israeli politics and the 40 years of bad blood between the two countries , he wo n’t get far .
( Hard to believe that France was once Israel ’s closest ally . )
The contour of French support for a two - state solution around the 1967 lines will not change .
Is Sarko pro-Israel ?
Yes .
Does it matter ?
No .
France has the largest Jewish population in Europe and the world ’s third biggest ( as well as Europe ’s largest Muslim population ) but there is no “ Jewish vote ” and no French AIPAC .
Sarko is likely to have done well with Jewish voters ( he got an astounding 90 % of he absentee ballots in Israel ) .
But one should not read too much into it .
France ’s Arab policy might tilt toward Israel ever so slightly but Sarko will quickly discover that his room for manoeuvre is very limited .
Sarko ’s Jewish roots are irrelevant .
His strong support among Sephardic Jews reflect his tough stance against the antisemitic violence that flared up during the second Intifada .
Many Sephardim live near or in the “ hottest ” banlieues and suffered the brunt of Muslim anti-Jewish hostility .
Although this new form of European antisemitism has since declined , it would be tragic to dismiss it .
To his credit , Sarkozy did not .
Some perspective might be useful , however .
Sharon ’s attempts to portray France as an antisemitic country
was silly pandering .
The 2006 Pew Global Attitudes Survey asked the question : “ Do you have a very or somewhat favorable opinion of Jews ? ”
The answer was “ yes ” for 86 % in France , 77 % in the US , and 74 % in Britain ( the figure for that staunch Israeli ally , Turkey , was 15 % ) .
More interesting , among Muslim respondents , the answer was “ yes ” for 71 % in France but only 32 % in Britain ( even though the UK has far fewer Arab Muslims ) .
It would appear , therefore , that the antisemitic violence is hardly representative of French Muslim society as a whole .
It must also be pointed out , if there were any need for it , that the most prevalent form of racism in France is not against Jews but Muslims .
Sarko the American ?
Washington will have a hard time getting its head around it , but trans - Atlantic relations have ceased to be Europe ’s main focus ( except in Britain ) .
U.S. - EU relations will improve but the era of a grand common planned destiny is over .
Europe will let America ’s dreams of liberal hegemony vanish , the idea having outlived its usefulness .
The EU has a bigger economy and a larger population than the U.S.
With the end of the Cold War and the Iraq war debacle , America ’s military umbrella has lost credibility ( at least in Western Europe ) .
NATO got its second wind in Kosovo but is now dying a painful death in Afghanistan .
( Sarko wants out . )
France ’s priorities outside the EU will be on the global South , while it channels its Asian policy through the EU .
On a personal level , Sarko loves America .
But so did Chirac ; and , to measure the full irrelevance of personal leanings in this matter , consider that the closest Franco - American relations in the last 50 years took place under the most ideologically anti-American president , François Mitterrand .
A President Sarkozy in 2003 would have never joined America ’s war in Iraq ( pace Kouchner ) .
Sarko will be friendly to the White House and kind to Brown and Merkel ’s Atlanticist sensitivities .
But smiles do n’t make policy .
Good luck , Mr President !
Nicolas Sarkozy once confided to a journalist : “ I do n’t want to be president .
I must be president . ”
Ruling France might prove a good therapy for Sarko .
Let ’s hope it is good for the French , too — especially
those of a darker skin tone who ’ve been left behind .
I am full of doubts about Sarko .
But I ’ll root for his success
and hope he proves me wrong .
Newsweek has a brief article on what research has told us about the link between money and happiness .
Essentially , more money makes you happier until you ’re comfortable , and then , it really does n’t do much good .
Interestingly though , a study that looked at how happy a number of similarly earning young people were , found that the happier ones went on the make more money later in life .
If money does n’t buy happiness , what does ?
Grandma was right when she told you to value health and friends , not money and stuff .
Or as Diener and Seligman put it , once your basic needs are met “ differences in well - being are less frequently due to income , and are more frequently due to factors such as social relationships and enjoyment at work . ”
Other researchers add fulfillment , a sense that life has meaning , belonging to civic and other groups , and living in a democracy that respects individual rights and the rule of law .
If a nation wants to increase its population ’s sense of well - being , says Veenhoven , it should make “ less investment in economic growth and more in policies that promote good governance , liberties , democracy , trust and public safety . ”
( Curiously , although money does n’t buy happiness , happiness can buy money .
Young people who describe themselves as happy typically earn higher incomes , years later , than those who said they were unhappy .
It seems that a sense of well - being can make you more productive and more likely to show initiative and other traits that lead to a higher income .
Contented people are also more likely to marry and stay married , as well as to be healthy , both of which increase happiness . )
It ’s not only the case that money does n’t buy happiness , being materialistic is also associated with worse mental health and overall adjustment .

Sometimes we refer to Mayor Bloomberg as Mayor Bling because with a net worth with $ 5.5 billion ( according to Forbes ) , why not ?
And what 's frequently mentioned is how his staff is looking into the possibility of Bloomberg running for president - though he denies it all the time - because he would have about $ 1 billion to spend on a third - party campaign .
Former president Bill Clinton mentioned Bloomberg 's wealth with respect to needing to reign in campaign finance rules while stumping for his wife in Iowa .
First , Clinton praised him , " Let ’s take someone I really admire , the mayor of New York City Mike Bloomberg .
I like him , he ’s a really good mayor . ”
But Clinton 's admiration stops there : “ If he runs for president , he could spend $ 1 billion and hardly miss it .
That ’s real money for most of the rest of us .
Under the law there are no constraints . ”
However , Mayor Bloomberg said , " Statistics show that wealthy people who self - finance do n't win with any greater frequency than those who have to go out and raise money from others . "
The Sun suggests the Mayor 's words " he is prepared to parry attacks by spinning his money as a positive factor . "
In fact , Bloomberg made a point of saying how he's not beholden to big donors and that NYC voters knew he was spending his money in both mayoral elections , which he won .
The Sun also has an editorial that calls the former president out on his remarks , noting examples like John F. Kennedy 's campaign being financed by his father and Jon Corzine spending $ 62.7 million on his Senate campaign .
The Sun believes Clinton may be worried that Bloomberg could take away the " electoral votes of New York , California and Florida " from wife Hillary if the mayor should run .
Einstein ’s equation describing the equivalence of mass and energy is arguably the most famous equation in physics .
But his beautifully elegant derivation of this formula ( here is the English translation ) from previously understood laws of physics is considerably less famous .
( There is an amusing Far Side cartoon in this regard , with the punchline “ squared away ” , which you can find on - line by searching hard enough , though I will not link to it directly . )
This topic had come up in recent discussion on this blog , so I thought I would present Einstein ’s derivation here .
Actually , to be precise , in the paper mentioned above , Einstein uses the postulates of special relativity and other known laws of physics to show the following :
Proposition .
( Mass - energy equivalence )
If a body at rest emits a total energy of E while remaining at rest , then the mass of that body decreases by .
Assuming that bodies at rest with zero mass necessarily have zero energy , this implies the famous formula – but only for bodies which are at rest .
For moving bodies , there is a similar formula , but one has to first decide what the correct definition of mass is for moving bodies ; I will not discuss this issue here , but see for instance the Wikipedia entry on this topic .
Broadly speaking , the derivation of the above proposition proceeds via the following five steps :
Using the postulates of special relativity , determine how space and time coordinates transform under changes of reference frame ( i.e. derive the Lorentz transformations ) .
Using 1. , determine how the temporal frequency ( and wave number k ) of photons transform under changes of reference frame ( i.e. derive the formulae for relativistic Doppler shift ) .
Using Planck ’s relation ( and de Broglie ’s law ) and 2. , determine how the energy E ( and momentum p ) of photons transform under changes of reference frame .
Using the law of conservation of energy ( and momentum ) and 3. , determine how the energy ( and momentum ) of bodies transform under changes of reference frame .
Comparing the results of 4 . with the classical Newtonian approximations ( and ) , deduce the relativistic relationship between mass and energy for bodies at rest ( and more generally between mass , velocity , energy , and momentum for moving bodies ) .
Actually , as it turns out , Einstein ’s analysis for bodies at rest only needs to understand changes of reference frame at infinitesimally low velocity , .
However , in order to see enough relativistic effects to deduce the mass - energy equivalence , one needs to obtain formulae which are accurate to second order in v ( or more precisely , ) , as opposed to those in Newtonian physics which are accurate to first order in v .
Also , to understand the relationship between mass , velocity , energy , and momentum for moving bodies rather than bodies at rest , one needs to consider non-infinitesimal changes of reference frame .
Important note : Einstein ’s argument is , of course , a physical argument rather than a mathematical one .
While I will use the language and formalism of pure mathematics here , it should be emphasised that I am not exactly giving a formal proof of the above Proposition in the sense of modern mathematics ; these arguments are instead more like the classical proofs of Euclid , in that numerous “ self evident ” assumptions about space , time , velocity , etc. will be made along the way .
( Indeed , there is a very strong analogy between Euclidean geometry and the Minkowskian geometry of special relativity . )
One can of course make these assumptions more explicit , and this has been done in many other places , but I will avoid doing so here in order not to overly obscure Einstein ’s original argument .
— Lorentz transforms to first order —
To simplify the notation , we shall assume that the ambient spacetime S has only one spatial dimension rather than three , although the analysis here works perfectly well in three spatial dimensions ( as was done in Einstein ’s original paper ) .
Thus , in any inertial reference frame F , the spacetime S is parameterised by two real numbers ( t , x ) .
Mathematically , we can describe each frame F as a bijection between S and .
To normalise these coordinates , let us suppose that all reference frames agree to use a single event O in S as their origin ( 0,0 ) ; thus
(1)
for all frames F .
Given an inertial reference frame , one can generate new inertial reference frames in two different ways .
One is by reflection : one takes the same frame , with the same time coordinate , but reverses the space coordinates to obtain a new frame , thus reversing the orientation of the frame .
In equations , we have
if , then ( 2 )
for any spacetime event E. Another way is by replacing the observer which is stationary in F with an observer which is moving at a constant velocity v in F , to create a new inertial reference frame with the same orientation as F .
In our analysis , we will only need to understand infinitesimally small velocities v ; there will be no need to consider observers traveling at speeds close to the speed of light .
The new frame and the original frame must be related by some transformation law
(3)
for some bijection .
A priori , this bijection could depend on the original frame F as well as on the velocity v , but the principle of relativity implies that is in fact the same in all reference frames F , and so only depends on v .
It is thus of interest to determine what the bijections are .
From our normalisation ( 1 ) we have
(4 )
but this is of course not enough information to fully specify .
To proceed further , we recall Newton ’s first law , which states that an object with no external forces applied to it moves at constant velocity , and thus traverses a straight line in spacetime as measured in any inertial reference frame .
( We are assuming here that the property of “ having no external forces applied to it ” is not affected by changes of inertial reference frame .
For non-inertial reference frames , the situation is more complicated due to the appearance of fictitious forces . )
This implies that transforms straight lines to straight lines .
( To be pedantic , we have only shown this for straight lines corresponding to velocities that are physically attainable , but let us ignore this minor technicality here . )
Combining this with ( 4 ) , we conclude that is a linear transformation .
( It is a cute exercise to verify this claim formally , under reasonable assumptions such as smoothness of . )
Thus we can view now as a matrix .
When v=0 , it is clear that should be the identity matrix I .
Making the plausible assumption that varies smoothly with v , we thus have the Taylor expansion
(5 )
for some matrix and for infinitesimally small velocities v. ( Mathematically , what we are doing here is analysing the Lie group of transformations via its Lie algebra . )
Expanding everything out in coordinates , we obtain
(6 )
for some absolute constants ( not depending on t , x , or v ) .
The next step , of course , is to pin down what these four constants are .
We can use the reflection symmetry ( 2 ) to eliminate two of these constants .
Indeed , if an observer is moving at velocity v in frame F , it is moving in velocity - v in frame , and hence .
Combining this with ( 2 ) , ( 3 ) , ( 6 ) one eventually obtains
and . ( 7 )
Next , if a particle moves at velocity v in frame F , and more specifically moves along the worldline , then it will be at rest in frame , and ( since it passes through the universally agreed upon origin O ) must then lie on the worldline .
From ( 3 ) , we conclude
for all t. ( 8 )
Inserting this into ( 6 ) ( and using ( 7 ) ) we conclude that .
We have thus pinned down to first order almost completely :
(9 )
Thus , rather remarkably , using nothing more than the principle of relativity and Newton ’s first law , we have almost entirely determined the reference frame transformation laws , save for the question of determining the real number .
[ In mathematical terms , what we have done is classify the one - dimensional Lie subalgebras of which are invariant under spatial reflection , and coordinatised using ( 8 ) . ]
If this number vanished , we would eventually recover classical Galilean relativity .
If this number was positive , we would eventually end up with the ( rather unphysical ) situation of Euclidean relativity , in which spacetime had a geometry isomorphic to that of the Euclidean plane .
As it turns out , though , in special relativity this number is negative .
This follows from the second postulate of special relativity , which asserts that the speed of light c is the same in all inertial reference frames .
In equations ( and because has the same orientation as F ) , this is asserting that
for all t ( 10 + )
and
for all t. ( 10 -)
Inserting either of ( 10 + ) or ( 10 - ) into ( 9 ) we conclude that , and thus we have obtained a full description of to first order :
( 11 )
— Lorentz transforms to second order —
It turns out that to get the mass - energy equivalence , first - order expansion of the Lorentz transformations is not sufficient ; we need to expand to second order .
From Taylor expansion we know that
( 12 )
for some matrix .
To compute this matrix , let us make the plausible assumption that if the frame is moving at velocity v with respect to F , then F is moving at velocity -v with respect to .
( One can justify this by considering two frames receding at equal and opposite directions from a single reference frame , and using reflection symmetry to consider how these two frames move with respect to each other . )
Applying ( 3 ) we conclude that .
Inserting this into ( 12 ) and comparing coefficients we conclude that .
Since is determined from ( 11 ) , we can compute everything explicitly , eventually ending up at the second order expansion
( 13 )
One can continue in this fashion ( exploiting the fact that the must form a Lie group ( with the Lie algebra already determined ) , and using ( 8 ) to fix the parameterisation of that group ) to eventually get the full expansion of , namely
,
but we will not need to do so here .
— Doppler shift —
The formula ( 13 ) is already enough to recover the relativistic Doppler shift formula ( to second order in v ) for radiation moving at speed c with some wave number k .
Mathematically , such radiation moving to the right in an inertial reference frame F can be modeled by the function
for some amplitude A and phase shift .
If we move to the coordinates provided by an inertial reference frame F’ , a computation then shows that the function becomes
where .
( actually , if the radiation is tensor - valued , the amplitude A might also transform in some manner , but this transformation will not be of relevance to us . )
Similarly , radiation moving at speed c to the left will transform from
to
where .
This describes how the wave number k transforms under changes of reference frame by small velocities v.
The temporal frequency is linearly related to the wave number k by the formula
, ( 14 )
and so this frequency transforms by the ( red- shift ) formula
( 15 + )
for right - ward moving radiation and by the ( blue - shift ) formula
( 15 -)
for left - ward moving radiation .
( As before , one can give an exact formula here , but the above asymptotic will suffice for us . )
— Energy and momentum of photons —
From the work of Planck , and of Einstein himself on the photoelectric effect , it was known that light could be viewed both as a form of radiation ( moving at speed c ) , and also made up of particles ( photons ) .
From Planck ’s law , each photon has an energy of and ( from de Broglie ’s law ) a momentum of , where h is Planck ’s constant , and the sign depends on whether one is moving rightward or leftward .
In particular , from ( 14 ) we have the pleasant relationship
( 16 )
for photons .
[ More generally , it turns out that for arbitrary bodies , momentum , velocity , and energy are related by the formula , though we will not derive this fact here . ]
Applying ( 15 + ) , ( 15 - ) , we see that if we view a photon in a new reference frame , then the observed energy E and momentum p now become
; ( 17 + )
for right - ward moving photons , and
; ( 17 -)
for left - ward moving photons .
These two formulae ( 17 + ) , ( 17 - ) can be unified using ( 16 ) into a single formula
( 18 )
for any photon ( moving either leftward or rightward ) with energy E and momentum p as measured in frame F , and energy E ’ and momentum p’ as measured in frame .
Actually , the error term can be deleted entirely by working a little harder .
From the linearity of and the conservation of energy and momentum , it is then natural to conclude that ( 18 ) should also be valid not only for photons , but for any object that can exchange energy and momentum with photons .
This can be used to derive the formula fairly quickly , but let us instead give the original argument of Einstein , which is only slightly different .
— Einstein ’s argument —
We are now ready to give Einstein ’s argument .
Consider a body at rest in a reference frame F with some mass and some rest energy .
( We do not yet know that is equal to . )
Now let us view this same mass in some new reference frame , where v is a small velocity .
From Newtonian mechanics , we know that a body of mass moving at velocity v acquires a kinetic energy of .
Thus , assuming that Newtonian physics is valid at low velocities to top order , the net energy E ’ of this body as viewed in this frame should be
( 19 )
If assumes that the transformation law ( 18 ) applies for this body , one can already deduce the formula for this body at rest from ( 19 ) ( and the assumption that bodies at rest have zero momentum ) , but let us instead give Einstein ’s original argument .
We return to frame F , and assume that our body emits two photons of equal energy , one moving left - ward and one moving right - ward .
By ( 16 ) and conservation of momentum , we see that the body remains at rest after this emission .
By conservation of energy , the remaining energy in the body is .
Let ’s say that the new mass in the body is .
Our task is to show that .
To do this , we return to frame .
By ( 16 + ) , the rightward moving photon has energy
; ( 20 + )
in this frame ; similarly , the leftward moving photon has energy
. ( 20 -)
What about the body ?
By repeating the derivation of ( 18 ) , it must have energy
( 20 )
By the principle of relativity , the law of conservation of energy has to hold in the frame as well as in the frame F .
Thus , the energy ( 20 - ) +( 20 + ) +( 20 ) in frame after the emission must equal the energy E’= ( 19 ) in frame before emission .
Adding everything together and comparing coefficients we obtain the desired relationship .
[ One might quibble that Einstein ’s argument only applies to emissions of energy that consist of equal and opposite pairs of photons .
But one can easily generalise the argument to handle arbitrary photon emissions , especially if one takes advantage of ( 18 ) ; for instance , another well - known ( and somewhat simpler ) variant of the argument works by considering a photon emitted from one side of a box and absorbed on the other .
More generally , any other energy emission which could potentially in the future decompose entirely into photons would also be handled by this argument , thanks to conservation of energy .
Now , it is possible that other conservation laws prevent decomposition into photons ; for instance , the law of conservation of charge prevents an electron ( say ) from decomposing entirely into photons , thus leaving open the possibility of having to add a linearly charge - dependent correction term to the formula .
But then one can renormalise away this term by redefining the energy to subtract such a term ; note that this does not affect conservation of energy , thanks to conservation of charge . ]

Getting Light to Bend Backwards
Uniquely sandwiched materials coax light to defy nature and skirt the laws of refraction
An artist 's rendition of the new light - bending metamaterial .
October 16 , 2007
This material is available primarily for archival purposes .
Telephone numbers or other contact information may be out of date ; please see current contact information at media contacts .
While developing new lenses for next - generation sensors , researchers have crafted a layered material that causes light to refract , or bend , in a manner nature never intended .
Refraction always bends light one way , as one can see in the illusion of a " bent " drinking straw when observed through the side of a glass .
A new metamaterial crafted from alternating layers of semiconductors ( indium - gallium - arsenic and aluminum - indium - arsenic ) acts as a single lens that refracts light in the opposite direction .
Refraction is the reason that lenses have to be curved , a trait that limits image resolution .
With the new metamaterial , flat lenses are possible , theoretically allowing microscopes to capture images of objects as small as a strand of DNA .
The current metamaterial lens works with infrared light , but the researchers hope the technology will expand to other wavelengths in the future .
Earlier efforts have crafted metamaterials that bend light in a similar way , but this is the first to do so using a 3 - dimensional structure and a metamaterial comprised entirely of semiconductors .
Those traits will prove critical for incorporating the technology into devices such as chemical threat sensors , communications equipment and medical diagnostics tools .
The paper describing the technology appeared online Oct. 14 , 2007 , in Nature Materials .
The research was developed primarily at NSF 's Mid-Infrared Technologies for Health and the Environment Engineering Research Center and NSF 's Princeton Center for Complex Materials Materials Research Science and Engineering Center .

When you think of social networks you probably think of MySpace .
But recently , Facebook has been gaining popularity - since it opened up beyond college users , it has enjoyed a flood of new users , boosted further by the launch of Facebook apps .
It 's time these two social networks fought it out .
Round 1 : Design
Layout : Facebook wins here because the profiles are well set up and neatly organized and it's easy to navigate through the profiles to find the info you want .
It mainly beats MySpace because most profiles are so ugly and inconsistent .
Overall Site Design : Facebook is obviously the winner here .
MySpace looks so unprofessionally done when compared to Facebook , mainly again because of it's inconsistent design .
This time its MySpace themselves , not the users , who make the site difficult to use .
Profiles :
This is a tie because MySpace has a lot of customization , but Facebook 's default looks better than MySpace 's and it's very neat and well organized .
Customization : MySpace and Facebook tie here .
While Facebook lets you add and remove applications , MySpace lets you do whatever you want with the pages , if you know a little HTML that is .
Unfortunately thats the reason MySpace 's design is so unruly for the most part .
Site Organization : Both site are pretty well organized .
However , Facebook wins because of its clean layout that allows you to find everything right away , and it 's start page is a link to everything you need in neat and tidy boxes .
Round Winner : Facebook !
Round 2 : Media
Pictures : Facebook wins here because of its well - organized picture section and the ability to tag people and have people tag themselves .
Also , with the apps recently released you can now add Fiickr and other photosharing site streams to your profile .
However , Fox now owns Photobucket , which provides photo hosting to MySpace users .
Videos :
This one is a tie because both MySpace and Facebook let you upload video and they both have their own flash player .
MySpace will let you embed video into your profile but you can post videos to Facebook as well .
Music : MySpace wins , but only just - we all know that every band ever has a MySpace account .
However , with the new Facebook apps you can add your data from music tracking sites like Last.fm and iLike : in fact the top app on Facebook at the moment is the iLike app .
Sharing : Now , Facebook 's advantage here is only a slight one .
Facebook allows you to share media links very easily and i fact automatically though the Facebook feed , something that I 'm sure many MySpace users would like to be able to do ( MySpace News is n't really suited to this ) .
You can , however , grab embedded media like videos from other profiles to repost on MySpace .
Round Winner : Facebook !
Round 3 : Community
Relationships : A big difference on Facebook is that the friends you add are usually your real friends .
It 's not a contest like on MySpace where everyone is trying to have the most friends .
On Facebook it about talking to the people you know and sharing things with them .
Groups : Both sites have groups , but Facebook makes them more prominent .
They are a bigger part of the service and there are a lot of people using them for clever uses like planning meet up and giving info to fans .
Keeping Track of What 's New : Facebook kills MySpace here .
On MySpace the only way to know if a friend added something new to their profile is to go look at it , and the only way to know if you made a new friends is to look for the person .
Facebook has two feeds .
One tells you what 's new with you , like who accepted your friend request or your posted items , etc .
The other feed tells you what 's up with all your friends , like who they added and what groups they joined .
Messaging :
This is a tie .
They both have a place where people can leave messages on your profile and they both have a basic mail system .
Co-Workers : Facebook can be used as a tool to talk to the people you work with also and see what 's new with them .
You can even join a network for your company .
MySpace was really designed for teens so it does n't really have these types of features .
Round Winner : Facebook !
Round 4 : Usefulness
Finding Old Friends :
One of the major reasons for joining a social network is to reconnect with old friends or classmates .
Facebook makes this really easy because the whole site is organized by schools and now by locations too .
So unless you forgot your friends name you will probably be able to find them if they have an account .
MySpace lets you search for school friends , but does n't put the emphasis on real friendships .
Communication : Facebook is a good way to contact people if you do n't know their contact info .
Someone is more likely to notice a Facebook message than a MySpace Message due to the fact that there is less Facebook spam .
Promoting Yourself : MySpace wins here .
Thousands of bands use MySpace to promote their music and their fans use it to show their support .
This is n't nearly as evident on Facebook , although groups allow companies to promote themselves .
Getting Laid :
If you are looking for action , then you 'll probably want to go with MySpace - see our survey for the reasons behind this .
Round Winner : MySpace !
Round 5 : Ease of Use
Adding Friends : MySpace wins here because adding new friends and accepting friends requests is usually a one click process .
The major advance here over Facebook is the ability to add large amounts of friends at once which for some reason was never added to Facebook .
Search :
The winner here is a little bit surprising when you consider Google does the search for the loser .
Facebook 's search beats MySpace by a mile .
Even though the search engine giant Google is providing MySpace 's search , its results are not nearly as useful as Facebook's .
The big issue here is that MySpace 's search looks in the whole profile , even when just looking for a person , Facebook 's is smart enough to know if you are looking for a user or a movie in someone 's interests .
Navigation : Both MySpace and Facebook have pretty decent navigation , but Facebook beats MySpace when it comes to getting to specific people 's profiles due to its superior search .
Privacy : Facebook makes it really easy to hide info from certain people and to not show information that you want to be kept private .
So , if you only want you close friends to see you contact info , it only takes a second .
MySpace has privacy too , but it 's far less granular .
Round Winner : Facebook !
An the Winner is ...
Facebook !!
MySpace was a great social network for a while , but now there are too many spammers and the developers have stopped innovating .
Facebook is just starting to become popular ( well , popular with those who were not on it when it was limited to schools ) .
So , you might want to check it out , while it 's still cool .

Police in Amsterdam are complaining over new rules banning them from smoking cannabis while off duty .
Officers in the Dutch capital , famous for its liberal drugs laws , have been told they must set the public " a good moral example " .
The ban , due to come into effect on January 1 , will make the force the first in the Netherlands to bar officers from using drugs when not at work .
Frank Gittay , the city 's police council chairman , said : " Until now police were only banned from showing up for work stoned or drunk .
" But now we are telling officers they should also behave like the police at all times .
" That means not taking drugs and not getting excessively drunk whether on or off duty . "
But Dutch police union chairman Hans van Duijn said : " Many of our members are opposed to this .
" They are not paid for 24 - hours a day .
What they do in their free time is up to them . "
Prompted by a comment on Slashdot , I would like to reprint this old blog post , which still makes me laugh :
Around 1987 or 1988 , I saw Larry Niven at a convention .
I was officially there to be the Star Trek guy , but I did n't have to go on stage for a few hours , and rather than sit in some suite with the rest of the Star Trek people who did n't want to get too close to the masses , I grabbed my backpack and wandered around the convention as nerdy fanboy number 42 .
I bought a ton of crap in the dealer 's room ( mostly FASA sourcebooks , and some bootleg anime videos IIRC ) and on my way down a hallway toward the gaming room , I saw this guy who was dressed in a Space Shuttle flight suit ( blue ) sitting behind a table that had some books on it .
Holy shit , it was Larry Niven .
I walked up to him and the conversation went something like this :
Me : OMG YOU'RE LARRY NIVEN !
Him : OMG YOU'RE WESLEY ON STAR TREK !
Both : CAN I HAVE YOUR AUTOGRAPH !
Both : YOU WANT MY AUTOGRAPH ?!
Both : YES !
Me : I do n't have a pen .
Him :
It 's okay , I have several .
He pulled a pen out of the shoulder pen-holding pocket thing on his blue Space Shuttle flight suit .
I was so out - nerded , it was n't even funny .
I tried to counter - attack by producing my own copy of Ringworld that I had in my backpack , because I carried it with me everywhere in those days , just in case , you know , I felt like reading it .
( I am not exaggerating at all .
I loved -- and continue to love -- that book that much .
For reals . )
This prompted the question , " Do you ever get bothered that you can't just walk around a convention like everyone else ?
Does it bother you that people are always trying to talk to you , even when you 're supposed to be having your ' own ' time ? "
To which I replied , " It depends on how much Sailor Moon porn I 'm attempting to buy . "
I made myself laugh , and then I realized that there probably really is Sailor Moon porn , and there are probably people who buy it .
Then I threw up in my mouth a little .
Have you ever had to laugh while there 's vomit in your mouth ?
It 's worse than holding a drink in your mouth while you get under control enough to swallow it .
Wow .
I really just bounded over the line on that one , did n't I ?
I mean , normally I can at least see the line behind me , but it 's way behind the horizon right now .
Okay .
Good to know .
Moving on .
Southampton police responding to burst water pipes in a Hampton Bays home found the mummified body of the owner -- dead for more than a year -- sitting in a chair in front of a television .
The television was still on .
Vincenzo Riccardi , 70 , appeared to have died of natural causes in his home , said Dr. Stuart Dawson , Suffolk County deputy chief medical examiner .
The medical examiner ’s office considered Riccardi ’s body mummified because the lack of humidity in his home preserved his features , morgue assistant Jeff Bacchus said .

“ You could see his face .
He still had hair on his head , ” Bacchus said .
“ I ’ve never seen anyone dead that long . ”
Police and county sources said Riccardi , whose body was found Thursday , had not been heard from since December 2005 .
The medical examiners said they were baffled as to why the electricity would be on in the home all that time .
“ He was in his house , sitting in his chair , as if watching television , and the television was , in fact , still on , ” Dawson said .
Riccardi lived alone ; his wife had died years ago , Dawson said .
Mail had piled up , but then delivery stopped .

Neighbors said Riccardi had diabetes and had become blind in his 50s .
His house was up a long driveway and could not be seen from the street .
CHILDREN HELD HERE IN AMERICA , IN IMMIGRATION DETENTION CENTERS
Remember those relocation and detention centers -- courtesy of Kellogg , Brown and Root , that we were all concerned about a few months back ?
Well , they 've begun to be put to use .
Before Bush II , illegal immigrants either remained in the U.S. while being processed , or were deported .
Bush II came up with the brilliant idea of detaining them without due process indefinitely .
Here is an excellent article on the detainment centers by Joseph Richey , and another by Nat Perry .
Here is an overview of how the detention policy fits in with the rest of Bushco 's immigration policies .
One result of this policy is the indefinite detainment of illegal immigrant children .
From From Amnesty International 's site , amnestyusa.org :
According to the INS , the number of unaccompanied children detained in the United States has more than doubled over the last five years , rising from 2,375 in 1997 to 5,385 in 2001 .
On any given day , it is estimated that 500 children are held in US immigration detention ...
Once US immigration authorities take them into custody , approximately one - third are detained in harsh conditions in secure , jail - like facilities designed for juvenile offenders ...
It is important to note that these children are held in detention for administrative reasons , not as punishment for criminal behavior .
They are not charged with any crime , but are often held for months or even years in punitive conditions ...
AI also visited three detention facilities housing unaccompanied minors .
As a result of this research , AI found that unaccompanied children caught in the U.S. immigration system are routinely deprived of their rights ...
Girls are more likely to be housed with adults or with delinquent juveniles because they are fewer in number ...
Of course , along with violations of habeas corpus , due process , international and domestic law and human decency , there are these horrors of inhuman treatment reported by AI :
Excessive Force , Restraints , Strip Searches
Disturbingly , AI also documented allegations of excessive use of force , administered in a manner that may constitute cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment , to a degree that reflects major organizational deficiencies as well as personal misconduct .
Children are subjected to pepper spray , placed in solitary confinement , and routinely restrained in violation of international standards ...
Staff reportedly kick children , throw them to the floor and knock their heads into walls for infractions such as looking the wrong way , saying " can I use the bathroom " instead of " may I , " or not being able to count properly ...
AI is alarmed by reports that not only are some children routinely shackled during transportation to court hearings , but in some instances they also may be shackled in the courtroom .
One advocate described to AI how she had seen a seven - year - old boy from Central America in handcuffs before a judge in California .
More specifically , there are stories about a detention center in Taylor , Texas by local newspapers and television newscasts .
The following story describes the daily living conditions there :
( From KXAN TV's website , kxan.com on the T. Don Hutto Immigration Detention Center
on Welch St. in Taylor , Texas ) :
What 's been drawing the most attention about the Hutto facility is that it used to be a prison .
The fences are still there in the front ... still wrapped in razor wire ...
We saw the cafeteria , the recreational facilities , and the places where the detainees live .
Although the doors inside are not locked , they are still traditional jail cell - style rooms , with a bed , toilet and a sink .
The facility has been under fire for detaining children .
In fact , most of the people in the facility are children of illegal immigrants ...
" We do everything we can to make this as comfortable a facility as possible [ and ] as appropriate to families as possible within the context that it is a detained setting , " said Gary Mead with U.S. Immigration Customs Enforcement .
" They are not free to leave . "
And the detainees are assigned clothing and have to have their personal belongings locked up during their time at the facility ... ... That center in Taylor is one of dozens of immigration centers around the state .
This article from the NYTtells more about daily living conditions at Taylor .
Here is a good dkos diary by Nag on the Texas facility , and another one here by edie .
CHILDREN HELD AT GUANTANAMO BAY
There are and have been children detained at Gauntanamo Bay .
From the Guardian Unlimited :
" [ The detention of youths ] reflects our broader concerns that the US never properly determined the legal status of those held in the conflict , " said James Ross , legal adviser for Human Rights Watch in New York .
Lt Col Johnson said the juveniles were being held because " they have potential to provide important information in the ongoing war on terrorism " .
" Their release is contingent on the determination that they are not a threat to the [ US ] nation and have no further intelligence value . "
Lt Col Johnson said officials determined that some detainees were younger than 16 during medical and other screenings after their arrival in Cuba .
He added that all the prisoners aged under 16 years were brought to Guantanamo after January 1 2002 - suggesting that some were 15 or younger when they were first imprisoned .
The detention environment at Guantanamo is more than just a prison facility , it has in fact been called " a system of torture . "
CHILDREN HELD AT ABU GHRAIB
From the BBC News website on Friday , 11 March , 2005
Children as young as 11 years old were held at Abu Ghraib , the Iraqi prison at the centre of the US prisoner abuse scandal , official documents reveal .
Brig Gen Janis Karpinski , formerly in charge of the jail , gave details of young people and women held there .
Her assertion was among documents obtained via legal action by the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) ...
Brig Gen Karpinski , who was in charge at Abu Ghraib from July to November 2003 , said she often visited the prison 's youngest inmates .
She said in her interview that she thought one boy " looked like he was eight years old " .
" He told me he was almost 12 , " she said .
" He told me his brother was there with him , but he really wanted to see his mother , could he please call his mother .
He was crying . "
This is the latest update I 've found so far on the videotapes of torture and abuse of children at Abu Ghraib .
On the legal aspects of children in detention , AI gives us the tip of the iceberg of violations of law :
Results of AI Research - Use and Conditions of Detention
According to international standards , children should be confined and imprisoned only in exceptional circumstances or as a last resort , and then only for the shortest possible time .
Nevertheless , AI found that unaccompanied children in the U.S. are not only detained , but often are held in facilities that routinely fail to adhere to both international and domestic standards .
There is much , much more available to report on these issues .
The forgotten children at U.S. detention centers is something that has recieved little or no coverage and deserves to be greatly highlighted .
It should be added to the top of the list of impeachable offenses committed by the Bush regime .
I intend to diary further on this topic of the fate of children in detention , including more about the detention facilities , organizations working on the issue for human rights , etc .
It works !
