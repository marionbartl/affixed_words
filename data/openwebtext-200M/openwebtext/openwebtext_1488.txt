- Giveaway Winners !
Forum members and e-mail tipsters are saying this problem is primarily affecting owners of the older model of the PlayStation 3 , and is even causing users to lose trophies previously earned .
Many titles , such as Heavy Rain , are also now unplayable due to connection issues with Sony 's servers .
One theory points to an issue with the console 's internal calendar , which is reportedly resetting pre-slim models to 12/31/1999 .
It 's unclear at the moment how widespread this issue is .
IGN has contacted SCEA for additional updates on what 's causing these errors .
Update : Sony has confirmed that slim PS3s ( the 120/250 GB models ) appear to be unaffected .
Update 2 : According to Sony's US PlayStation blog , the company has " narrowed down the issue and have engineers working to restore service even as you read this . "
However , despite more calls to Sony there 's no indication on the time it 'll take to fix – or indeed what the fix will be .
More updates the instant we get them .
Update 3 : Sony has yet to provide an official update on the problem .
The company did say , however , owners should wait before trying to resolve the issue .
" Please do n't trust info regarding this issue unless from an official Sony source . "
Update 4 : Sony just released the following statement :
" As you may be aware , some customers have been unable to connect to the PlayStation Network today .
This problem affects the models other than the new slim PS3 .
We believe we have identified that this problem is being caused by a bug in the clock functionality incorporated in the system .
Errors include :
* The date of the PS3 system may be re-set to Jan 1 , 2000 .
* When the user tries to sign - in to the PlayStation Network , the following message appears on the screen ; " An error has occurred .
You have been signed out of PlayStation Network ( 8001050 F ) " .
* When the user tries to launch a game , the following error message appears on the screen and the trophy data may disappear ; " Failed to install trophies .
Please exit your game . "
* When the user tries to set the time and date of the system via the Internet , the following message appears on the screen ; " The current date and time could not be obtained .
( 8001050 F ) "
* Users are not able to playback certain rental video downloaded from the PlayStation Store before the expiration date .
We hope to resolve this problem within the next 24 hours .
In the meantime , if you have a model other than the new slim PS3 , we advise that you do not use your PS3 system , as doing so may result in errors in some functionality , such as recording obtained trophies , and not being able to restore certain data .
As mentioned above , Please be advised that the new slim PS3 is not affected with this error .
We are doing our best to resolve the issue and do apologise for any inconvenience caused . "
Makefile tricks GNU make is an extremely powerful program , and can be used to automate the building and testing of software .
The only problem with using it is that makefile syntax is rather cryptic , and debugging complex makefiles can be difficult .
If a dependency relationship is incorrect , then a file may not be rebuilt when it needs to be .
This can cause intermittent bugs as inconsistent interfaces cause undefined behavior .
Another possibility is rebuilding too much , which slows down the build - test development cycle .
What we would like is a perfect dependency graph that allows make to rebuild exactly what is needed and no more .
Fortunately , it is possible to automate the production of dependencies within a makefile .
This is possible due to the gcc -M flag .
This outputs dependency information in the form make requires for the given source file .
By collating these outputs for every source file , we may automatically construct the dependency graph .
Unfortunately , this is n't as simple as it appears .
One could of course , call the compiler to get the dependency information on every invocation of make .
This is obviously not ideal , as most of the time a file is n't modified , and so its dependency information is still up to date .
By sending the dependency output to separate files , we can then use the make dependency information itself to determine when to update these files .
The GNU make manual explains how this can be done by using the following target : %.d : %.c $ ( SHELL ) - ec ' $ ( CC ) - M $ ( CPPFLAGS ) $< | sed '\ "s /$*.o/& $ @ / g '\ " > $ @ '
This pipes the output through the sed program to change foo .o : foo.c foo.h into : foo . o foo.d : foo.c foo.h
It does this by searching for the .o part of the target , and then rewriting the target to include the output dependency file name , which is within the $@ makefile variable .
The extra dependency on the *.d dependency file means that it will be rebuilt if the source file , or any of its dependencies are altered .
This is perfect - by including all of the *.d files together , we no longer have to edit the makefile whenever header interfaces are refractored .
The only requirement is to add new source files , and target programs when needed , much less work than before .
The above is n't the last word on dependency calculation though .
The first problem is that it includes all dependencies , even those on system headers in the files .
This can be fixed by changing to using the - MM instead of - M gcc flag .
( This flag is non-portable though , and may not be implemented on other compilers .
Whereas the - M flag is quite standard . )
The second problem is slightly annoying .
When a header is deleted , the dependency files may still mention it as a prerequisite .
Since make does n't know how to make the header file , it will stop with a warning or error until you delete the broken dependency files .
To fix this , all we need to do is wrap the prerequisite list with a $ ( wildcard ) function call .
This will filter out all missing files , preventing the error .
The sed script needs to change to : sed -n " H ; $ $ {g;s@ . *:\(.*\) @$*.o $ @ : \$$ \( wildcard \1\ ) @ ; p} "
This sed script first collates the whole file into the hold area via the H ; statement .
At the end of the file the $ {} regexp triggers .
( Note the dollar sign needs to be escaped into two dollar signed due to it running within make . )
This then copies the hold - space into pattern - space , and searches the file for the colon .
It wraps the right part with the function call , and creates the correct targets on the left .
Note that we use '@ ' as a separator instead of a slash because slashes within filenames would confuse sed .
The reason the whole file needs to be read is that gcc can output multi-line dependency information .
This needs to be properly wrapped by the $ wildcard function call .
The third problem is that the above method does n't work for whole - program compilation .
This is where all the *.c files in a program are listed on the compilers command line , and are compiled together to produce the result .
This allows inter - file optimization , producing faster programs and libraries .
Since the object files are not used , the dependency graph is wrong , and thus the above needs to be modified .
The simplest way to do this is to also record the dependency information within variables .
We may then use a function to calculate what is required from the variables depending what sources the target is compiled from .
Thus the sed script needs to change once more : sed -n " H ; $ $ {g;s@ . *:\(.*\) @$< := \ $$ \( wildcard \1\ )
$ *.o $ @ : $ $ \ ( $ < \ ) @ ; p} "
This version uses a trick of setting a variable with the same name as the source file to a list of its dependencies .
i.e. we end up with something like : foo .c := $ ( wildcard foo.c foo.h ) foo . o foo.c.d : $ ( foo. c )
Where we may use $ ( foo.c ) to obtain the dependencies of foo .c when required .
Note how we have used the .c.d extension instead of the more obvious .d
This is done because there may be multiple files with the same root used to create an executable .
i.e. g++ foo.c foo .S foo.cpp -o foo
Is a perfectly reasonable command line , creating the program foo from a C file , a pre-processorable assembler file , and a C++ file .
Thus multiple target patterns are required .
The nicest way to write this may be to use a macro : create_d = $ ( SHELL ) - ec ' gcc - MM $ ( CPPFLAGS ) $< | sed -n " H ; $ $ {g;s@ . *:\(.*\) @$< := \ $$ \( wildcard \1\ )
$ *.o $ @ : $ $ \ ( $ < \ ) @ ; p} " > $ @ ' %. S.d : %.S $ ( create_d ) %.c.d : %.c $ ( create_d ) %.cpp.d : %.cpp $ ( create_d )
Finally , how do we use the dependency information we now have stashed away in variables ?
The trick here is constructing a make macro-function to expand the list of program sources into program dependencies .
A set that do this is : dependless = %.o %.a %.d %.h expand = $ ( $ ( var ) ) $ ( var ) $ ( var ) .d depend_test = $ ( if $ ( filter $ ( dependless ) , $ ( var ) ) , $ ( var ) , $( expand ) ) depend = $ ( sort $ ( foreach var , $ ( 1 ) , $( depend_test ) ) )
With these , we may use the target : prerequisite pair $ ( PROGRAM ) : $ ( call depend , $( SRCS ) )
To automatically calculate the exact dependencies required for our program to be built .
The only problem remaining is that the prerequisite list no longer contains just source files .
We cannot use the helpful $^ automatic makefile variable in the compilation command line as it will drag in extra things we do not want .
To fix this , another macro is required : & = $ ( filter - out %.h %.d , $ ^ )
This introduces the magic variable $ & which will act exactly like $^ would have done .
Note that since it is one character long , we do not have to use the syntax $ ( & ) , and can use the nice short representation .
Now only one thing remains , we need to find the best way of including the dependency files .
The obvious way of doing this is enumerating all of the source files , and then using pattern substitution to get the list of dependency files .
This suffers from the problem that there may not be such a list in a complex makefile , with multiple programs being built .
It turns out that such a list is n't required .
The simple wildcard - include works : include $ ( wildcard *.d )
This misses the dependencies for source files that have n't be built yet .
However , if a source file has n't been built , then we know it is out of date , and do n't really care about its exact dependency information .
Thus this quick trick really does work .
More complex build systems have multiple directories of source code .
For many years , people have used recursive build systems , where sub - makes are spawned in the subdirectories , and so on up the directory tree .
The problem with this technique is that the dependency graph is broken into pieces .
The missing dependencies mean that make does not do its job properly , and either too much or too little is rebuilt .
Another problem is that parallel builds are not efficiently done as the sub - makes cannot communicate between themselves to obtain the correct number of threads to run .
The solution to this is to use a non-recursive build system .
One way to do this that obviously does n't scale is to use a single monolithic makefile in the root directory .
A better method is to have the makefiles for the subdirectories included into the main makefile somehow via the include directive .
The problem there is that the paths in the included makefiles are relative to the root directory .
Thus all the files need to have the path prefixed .
This can be a major pain to do .
Fortunately , the path calculation and recursive inclusion can be automated .
We define the following macros : inc_before := mak_before.mk inc_after := mak_after .mk rest = $ ( wordlist 2 , $ ( words $ ( 1 ) ) , $ ( 1 ) ) get_dirlist = $ ( inc_before ) $ ~$ ( firstword $ (1 ) ) /makefile.inc $ ( wildcard $ ~$ ( firstword $ ( 1 ) ) /*.d ) $ ( inc_after ) \ $ ( if $ ( rest ) , $( call get_dirlist , $( rest ) ) , ) scan_subdirs = $ ( eval dirlist : =$ ( SUBDIRS ) $ ( dirlist ) ) $ ( call get_dirlist , $( SUBDIRS ) )
This allows one to use the syntax : SUBDIRS := dir1 dir2 dir3 include $ ( scan_subdirs )
To include the makefiles ( called makefile.inc ) within each of the directories dir1 , dir2 and dir3 .
The above also makes sure to correctly include the *.d dependency files .
However , what are the mak_before .mk and mak_after .mk ?
These are files used to keep track of the directory information .
The source for mak_before .mk is : # Called before including a sub directory makefile #
Save directory name dstackp := $ ( dstackp ) . X dstack $ ( dstackp ) := $ ~ # Build directory name ~ := $ ~ $ ( firstword $ ( dirlist ) ) / # Remove current directory from list dirlist := $ ( call rest , $( dirlist ) )
This file records the previous path , and then sets the $ ~ variable to be the path for the current directory .
It obtains the current path via the $ ( dirlist ) variable which is itself updated in the $ ( scan_subdirs ) macro .
Finally , the mak_after .mk file is : # Called after including a sub directory makefile #
Add defaults to clean files cleanfiles += $ ( addprefix $ ~ , $( clean_default ) ) # Restore directory name ~ := $ ( dstack $ ( dstackp ) ) dstackp := $ ( basename $ ( dstackp ) )
This resets the path variable , and also updates the list of files to be cleaned .
An example list of default files to be removed is clean_default = *.o *.a *. so *.so .* *.d
This will be expanded in every source directory and saved into the $ ( cleanfiles ) variable for later usage with the clean : target in the main makefile .
The above will make the $ ~ variable contain the path relative to the root makefile .
This allows the sub - makefiles to include rules like : $ ~ foo_prog : $ ( call depend $ ~ foo.c ) which will be expanded into something like directory / path / to / foo_prog : $ ( call depend directory / path / to / foo. c )
Thus a large amount of error - prone typing may be avoided .
However , there is one problem .
make does two passes through a makefile .
It is only in the second pass that variables within shell commands are expanded .
Thus if you use $ ~ within a compiler command line , then it will use the last definition for it .
Since the commands are evaluated at " top level " , this will result in an empty path , and thus empty variable .
This is typically not what is desired .
Fortunately , there is a work - around for this problem .
Typically , the target resides within the directory of the included sub - makefile , thus one may use the $ ( @D ) variable with a trailing slash instead .
To prevent misuse of the $ ~ variable , I suggest setting it to some invalid value after including the subdirectories in the root makefile .
i.e. SUBDIRS := some_dir some_other_dir include $ ( scan_subdirs ) ~:= tilde is broken in commands
Since it is unlikely you have a target or source called " tilde " or " is " , this should flag an error .
A similar problem can exist with variables updated by the += construct .
This is often used to update a list of targets within sub - makefiles , so that invocation by the root makefile does what is wanted .
( An example usage is the $ ( cleanfiles ) variable above . )
The problem is that if the variable is initially initialized by a ' = ' instead of a ' := ' operator , then the $ ~ evaluation will wait until after the first makefile pass .
The wrong value will be used , and wrong results will be obtained .
To fix this , simply use ' := ' to initialize the appended - to variable in the root makefile .
The above tricks should hopefully remove much of the complexity from using a non-recursive build system based on make , and hide it within macros .
The individual sub - makefiles may then be quite simple , and only list sources and targets .
The dependencies can be calculated as required by the automation .
Simple makefiles are much easier to maintain , and keep up to date .
They also make debugging dependency problems easier .
No longer will you have to worry about building too much or too little .

Beads
Alice Shapiro
Ahead of all games , it is a wonderment
that a cache of jewels is not the prize .
Pearls laid round a silken neck
contain a power , erect as a queen ’s dignity ,
delicate as a flower in bud .
They speak
invisible gossips , judging this and that .
One brushes a hand gently over their roundness
and feels sublime exhilaration , comparing
their company to the ascent of the sun .
Wild swain had first to gather them intact
from the deep , where an ink - black ocean
conceals a mystery : that one would not survive
the catch .
Tangled in sea ’s rockweed is more
than an occupation .
It is the trap .
Comment :
Hemingway ’s identification of love with death sometimes feels very heavy - handed .
It is true love entails loss .
But love and death are each so much more for us .
Above , the central line concerns a thrill that is considerably less : “ comparing their [ pearls ’ ] company to the ascent of the sun . ”
Pearls are just silly beads ; one might be tempted to think that the “ sun ” could be identified with each pearl .
But that cannot be : the owner thinks herself the sun rising , and the pearls are an ornament .
That the owner ’s esteem would probably shrink if the pearls were gone speaks volumes about the owner ’s esteem , not the pearls .
The movement to “ the ascent of the sun ” is : “ dignity , ” sexuality / identity ( “ delicate as a flower in bud ” ) , judgment ( “ invisible gossips ” ) .
The “ power ” is imagined as a person , then a flower , then something completely invisible .
Not really a “ power , ” but a spell cast over the owner herself .
The spell cast comes from a dark myth ( “ ink - black ocean ” ) , which may be like the tales told by that guy claiming to be a soldier at the bar , the one bragging about his kill count .
He may be full of it , but the fact his tales would be appealing to anyone is the real darkness of the story .
Lovers descend and sacrifice themselves so one can feel like they ’re rising .
Which brings us back to where we begun .
“ Ahead of all games , it is a wonderment / that a cache of jewels is not the prize . ”
The appeal of the story underlying pearls is the real “ wonderment . ”
There is a curious lack of dignity , identity , sensuality or even judgment in having or wanting pearls .
The pettiness involved is so much a nothingness that it looks like we have revealed something fundamental about human nature .
Should n’t all of our games reduce to this critique ?
They do n’t : what has been described is “ ahead of all games . ”
What is described in the poem never was truly human ; this is the game beyond all games , and therefore entirely divorced from reality .
Perhaps the academy would argue that the separate awards guarantee equity , since men and women have received the exactly the same number of best acting Oscars .
And the academy is not alone in this regard : the Golden Globes , the Screen Actors Guild , the British Academy of Film and the Independent Spirit Awards all split acting nominees by sex as well .

But separate is not equal .
While it is certainly acceptable for sports competitions like the Olympics to have separate events for male and female athletes , the biological differences do not affect acting performances .
The divided Oscar categories merely insult women , because they suggest that women would not be victorious if the categories were combined .
In addition , this segregation helps perpetuate the stereotype that the differences between men and women are so great that the two sexes cannot be evaluated as equals in their professions .
Today , the number of female - run production companies , female directors and great roles for women continues to increase .
Four of the five films represented in this year ’s best actress category center on strong female characters .
As women gain more influence in Hollywood , even the term “ actress ” is disappearing .
Just as stewardesses are now called flight attendants , many actresses now prefer to be called actors .
The Screen Actors Guild has eliminated the term “ actress ” in the presentation of its awards , instead using “ female actor . ”
Perhaps , as the term “ actress ” falls further out of favor , the award - granting organizations will be forced to acknowledge that male and female actors do indeed have the same occupation .
Collapsing two major categories into one would have the added value of reducing the length of the awards show , a move that many viewers would laud .
But if the academy wanted to preserve the number of acting awards , it could easily follow the lead of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association , which has , since 1951 , offered genre - based Golden Globe honors , for best performances in dramatic , and comedic and musical roles .
Afin d’enrichir sa suite bureautique Google Docs , Google rachète la start - up DocVerse , qui édite un plug - in offrant une solution de collaboration en mode cloud à partir de documents Microsoft Office .
Google a un appétit d’ogre .
Après avoir racheté ces dernières semaines des start - up aussi variées que Picnik , Aardvark et reMail , c’est au tour de DocVerse de tomber dans l’escarcelle du groupe Internet .
Créé en 2007 par des anciens employés de Microsoft , DocVerse se présente sous la forme d’une extension dédiée à la suite bureautique Microsoft Office ( Word , PowerPoint , Excel ) qui offre à ses utilisateurs de mettre à jour , de synchroniser et de sauvegarder ces types de documents en ligne .
DocVerse déploie également un outil de collaboration en ligne , qui permet à un groupe désigné , en temps réel , de consulter , d’annoter et de modifier à volonté des documents
Office , mais aussi de les sauvegarder et de les synchroniser en mode cloud computing .
Le montant de la transaction n’a pas été dévoilé .
Mais , grâce à l’acquisition de DocVerse , Google fait un beau pied de nez à Microsoft .
En effet , la firme de Mountain View compte favoriser l’interopérabilité entre sa suite bureautique Google Docs ( et sa suite logicielle Google Apps ) et les applications Microsoft Office .
L’objectif final pour Google est , grâce notamment à DocVerse , de pousser les nombreux utilisateurs de Microsoft Office vers ses propres outils de bureautique et de collaboration en ligne .
Déjà , il y a quelques semaines , Google avait fait un pas supplémentaire en direction du cloud computing en proposant aux utilisateurs de Google Docs un service de stockage et de partage de leurs documents en ligne .
Just a thought , which I decided to scribble down before I forgot it .
Key policy : Epigram is a declare - before - use language , temporally as well as spatially .
When you say x , you get the most local existing x at that time , or you get a new x generated as locally as possible .
In a declaration , spare names go into the generalisation prefix ; in a rhs , spare names go into the where clause , one way or another .
Naming is a surrogate for pointing , so once the bond of reference is created , it must not be broken by ill - propagated renamings , capturings , or whatever .
It ’s this policy which enables scope resolution at any point in time : there should never be any issue about the referent of an identifier .
Now , we go backwards as well as forwards , this time around , so what happens when you delete information .
Well , there are at least two sorts of undo : devaluation ( removing ( parts of ) the value of a symbol ) and degeneration ( removing the symbol altogether ) .
Now , you propagate a devaluation by rechecking and devaluing everything which depends on a devalued symbol .
Degeneration is much scarier .
But I remember now , there ’s a funny thing .
If you set things up right , you do n’t need degeneration , exactly …
Imagine we have only let ( the sooner we turn data into sugar for let , the better ) .
You can devalue a let , replacing the top rhs by a shed .
Now , key editing move : you can commute one let past another by turning
let f blah ; let g waffle
into
let g waffle ; let f blah
if waffle does not depend on f , or
let g waffle where f blah ; let f blah
otherwise .
Degeneration is thus the repetition of this refactoring until the global f falls off the end !
( For data as it is now , you need to generate a bunch of lets for the type , its constructors and its various gadgets . )
In terms of what happens to typedness , we should try to ensure that devaluation cannot increase the amount of brown .
Intuitively , removing information cannot increase the amount of stuff which is definitely wrong .
Of course , we should expect yellow all over the shop .
I mention this largely because this is pretty fundamental stuff , in terms of the propagation of updates around the system .
It ’s rooted in the proof engine , below the elaboration layer , so the time to figure it out is now .

US President Barack Obama has urged Congress to vote by simple majority on healthcare reform , as he makes a final push to have his proposals adopted .
He said Congress should " finish its work " and vote on the legislation in the next few weeks .
Healthcare has been a priority for Mr Obama but the legislation has been blocked by the Republican minority .
Last week , a televised summit hosted by Mr Obama in Washington failed to break the deadlock between parties .
' Implacably opposed '
The president wants Congress to back the latest version of his $ 950bn ( £ 621 bn ) plan to cover uninsured Americans and lower premiums .
MARDELL'S AMERICA
Republicans will reject this almost instantly .
One conservative website has already put together a montage of clips showing Obama saying he would n't govern like this
Read Mark 's thoughts in full " I believe the United States Congress owes the American people a final vote on healthcare reform , " Mr Obama said in a speech at the White House .
He said the proposed reforms had incorporated the best ideas from the Democrats and the Republicans .
" I ask Congress to finish its work , and I look forward to signing this reform into law , " Mr Obama said .
" At stake right now is not just our ability to solve this problem , but our ability to solve any problem , " he added .
OBAMA'S COMPROMISES
Tax revenues : Medicare tax on high earners rises to 2.9 % from 2.35 % Affordability : Adoption of provisions from both House and Senate bills to help low - and moderate - income families Pre-existing conditions : Insurers would be barred from excluding such people from 2014 Regulation :
Young adults up to age of 26 can stay on parent 's plan Medical malpractice : Republican proposal to give grants to states to resolve disputes and reduce lawsuits Mr Obama said he opposed Republican calls to reject comprehensive bills passed by the House of Representatives and Senate last year and begin again with a more step - by - step approach .
" For us to start over now could simply lead to delay that could last for another decade or even more , " he said .
Health care legislation is currently stalled in Congress as the Senate Democrats no longer have the 60 - seat majority required to defeat blocking tactics by Republicans .
Both chambers need to pass a unified version of the legislation for the president to sign it into law .
' Government expansion '
The Democrats can make use of a legislative technique called " reconciliation " to force the bill through Congress , though Mr Obama avoided using the term .
The healthcare bill " deserves the same kind of up - or - down vote that was cast on welfare reform , the Children 's Health Insurance Program , Cobra health coverage for the unemployed , and both Bush tax cuts " , Mr Obama said , referring to other measures passed using reconciliation .
But the BBC's Paul Adams , in Washington , says the fact remains that the Republicans are implacably opposed to the sort of overhaul the president wants .
If the Democrats decide to force the issue to a vote on a simple majority , they are still going to have to fight every step of the way , our correspondent adds .
Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell reaffirmed his opposition to the president 's plan .
" Americans do n't want us to tack a few good ideas onto a bill that reshapes one - sixth of the economy , vastly expands the role of government and which raises taxes and cuts Medicare to pay for it all . "

Under new rules for the Paycheck Protection Program , borrowers have up to five years to repay loans that are not forgiven .

Description :
Now this is something you do n’t see every day , a custom metal suspension piece .
This is what happens when ART hits BDSM in the face with a creative stick .
This position in itself is torment on a beautiful level .
The arch , the strain of the back , the helplessness of of the victim .
The huge breasts exposed , nipples popping out and straining , clamped and weighted .
Her feet are exposed to caning and snapping .
This is agony in its most attractive form .
No hope for pleasure , just a slow suffering …
A Prayer from the Death Bed Great Britain Stars in Its Own Greek Tragedy
Greece 's budget deficit is impossibly high .
But Great Britain's is even higher .
Prime Minister Gordon Brown has his work cut out for him in this election year -- and the coming cuts will be painful .
Describing the events in Iran yesterday , CNN correspondent Ivan Watson made a point of mentioning that free food and drink were handed out in Azadi Square to those celebrating the 31st anniversary of the revolution – as if the treats were part of a cunning ploy by the Ahmadinejad government .
Although some of my friends in Tehran who walked for miles to attend the hours of festivities at Azadi Square told me regretfully that they were not offered free food or drink , I do n't doubt that refreshments were indeed distributed at the rally .
Last October
I attended a memorial service in Tehran organised by the Revolutionary Guard to honour hundreds of Iranian medical volunteers killed while caring for their comrades during the bloody eight - year war with Iraq .
At the entrance of the packed auditorium small trays of fruit , juice and water were handed out .
I tried to politely decline the offer from the man in camouflage , but was later happy that his insistence succeeded .
I found the banana and pineapple flavoured juice box quite refreshing as the service dragged on for a number of hours .
Anyone who has spent time in Iran and the Middle East knows about the hospitality of this region .
It 's extremely disrespectful for a host not to offer a guest food or drink .
To suggest that free food and drink were one of the motivating factors that brought hundreds of thousands out to Azadi Square yesterday is beyond absurd .
This assumption that in order to support Ahmadinejad one must be from a poor , rural or illiterate background highlights a larger bias in the western media in their attempt to demonise the Islamic Republic and ignore its widespread support .
As CNN and others have attempted to give background into the modern history of Iran , the deposed Shah has been described merely as " pro-western " with little mention of his utter lack of support from the Iranian masses and the brutal repression by his regime to forcefully quell any voice of dissent .
Similarly , it is rare to learn about the US - led coup against the democratically elected government in 1953 that put the Shah in power for more than two - and - a - half decades .
The Shah was not merely " pro-western " ; his absolute monarchy was a western creation and he remained what many consider a puppet of the US for his entire reign .
The Iranian overthrow of the Shah in 1979 , and the subsequent referendum on the Islamic Republic , were supported by the overwhelming majority of Iranians .
For the first time in centuries they were choosing their own destiny .
However , this destiny did not necessarily comply with the interests of those governments who had long influenced Iranian affairs and reaped profits from the country 's resources , particularly Iran 's immense oil reserves .
Since the revolution , the US and other western governments have been at odds with the Islamic Republic .
After the September 11 attacks in New York , the Bush administration carelessly lumped Iran ( along with its historic enemy , Saddam Hussein ) into its simplistic " Axis of Evil " category .
Most large media networks in the US followed suit and have not treated the Islamic Republic as anything less than evil in their coverage .
By removing this blatant Bush - era bias a more accurate image of the events unfolding in Iran emerges .
Since soon after its inception , the Islamic Republic has faced protests from varying numbers among Iranian society .
After last year 's disputed presidential elections , the opposition 's numbers reached a peak .
The Iranian authorities have imprisoned , beaten and even killed many of those who have taken to the streets in a condemnable display of force .
But is this really the " Twitter " , " Green " or just plain ol ' " revolution " that much of the western media is making it out to be ?
The pro-government masses that took to the streets in June after the elections to celebrate Ahmadinejad 's victory , and then again after the clashes during the Ashura holy day in December , and now to commemorate the anniversary of the revolution , should indicate that no , this is not a revolution but rather a deepening internal divide .
To speculate whether the majority of Iranians support the government or the opposition is irrelevant .
First we need to understand that it's not free juice boxes and small bags of cookies bringing the Iranian masses – from either side of the political divide – out on to the street .

The following speech was given by NORML ’s Deputy Director before nearly 500 attendees on Saturday , March 13 , at the opening plenary of Students for Sensible Drug Policy ‘s 11th International Conference , at the Fort Mason Center in San Francisco .
To read full coverage of the conference , please see DRCNet ’s report here .
My name is Paul Armentano and I ’m the Deputy Director of NORML , the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws , and I ’m the co-author of the book Marijuana Is Safer : So Why Are We Driving People to Drink ?
Max , Amber , Stacia and the many good folks at SSDP invited me to come here today to talk to you about how and why students have a vital role to play in ending marijuana prohibition .
First let ’s talk about the “ why ” : self - preservation .
The federal government has declared war on you .
Since 1965 law enforcement in this country have arrested over 20 million people for marijuana offenses .
But when you take a closer look at who is actually arrested you find that , for the most part , it is n’t the folks sitting on this panel ; it ’s all of you sitting out there – it ’s young people .
In short – the so - called ‘ war ’ on marijuana is really a war on youth .
According to a 2005 study commissioned by the NORML Foundation , 74 percent of the 800,000 or so Americans busted for pot each year are under age 30 , and one out of four are age 18 or younger .
That ’s nearly half a million young people at risk of losing their school loans , or being saddled with a lifelong criminal record at a time when they are just entering the workforce .
We ’re talking about an entire generation – and that ’s you out there – that has been alienated to believe that the police and their civic leaders are instruments of their oppression rather than their protection .
And the sad fact is : you ’re right !
The question is :
What are you going to do about it ?
If we ’re going to finally end this 70 + year failed public policy known as marijuana prohibition , then we need students to play a lead role .
Obviously those of you in this room have already taken a critical first step in leading this charge by joining SSDP and attending this conference .
But there ’s a lot more to be done and there ’s a lot more that you can do .
I believe that it was Ghandi who demanded that those who are oppressed be a part of there own liberation , and marijuana prohibition is no different .
I want you to look around you because it ’s you all who will ultimately bring about an end to prohibition .
And here ’s how you start , and it ’s really , really simple suggestion .
Start talking to others about the need to end marijuana prohibition .
Start talking about how this policy disproportionately and adversely impacts youth .
Start discussing about how this policy limits young people ’s opportunities at economic and academic success , and has repercussions that adversely affect people for the rest of their lives .
Start talking about how the war on weed endangers young people ’s health and safety because it enables teens to have easier access to pot than to legal , age - restricted intoxicants like alcohol and tobacco .
Talk about how prohibition forces young people to interact and befriend pushers of other illegal , more dangerous drugs .
Talk about how prohibition compels young people dismiss the educational messages they receive pertaining to the potential health risks posed by the use of ‘ hard drugs ’ and prescription pharmaceuticals because they say : “ If they lied to me about pot , why would n’t they be lying to me about everything else too . ”
Most importantly , talk about how criminal prohibition is far more likely to result in having all of you sitting in this room struggling to get over a lifelong criminal conviction than it is in any way going to discourage you or your friends from trying pot .
And when I say ‘ talk about it , ’ that ’s exactly what I mean – TALK .
But talk to those who know you – your family , your friends , your parents , your neighbors , your professors , your faculty advisers .
These are the people who you have built in credibility with .
These are the people who are most likely to share and act upon your concerns because they care about you .
They care about what you think , and they actually care about what happens to you .
( You know it ’s funny , so often I hear activists talk about how they want to spread the word by going out on some street - corner and handing out leaflets to strangers .
Or they want to engage in debates with some paid prohibitionist , as if by providing he or she with the facts about marijuana will somehow change his or her position .
Or they want to post messages on some anti-drug website .
Big deal .
Talking to strangers is easy ; it ’s talking to people you know that ’s hard .
But it ’s talking to people you know that is ultimately going to make a difference . )
So after you ’re done talking about the evils of the drug war with your friends , family , and faculty – and encouraging them to begin engaging in this conversation as well – then it ’s time to move the discussion to those who can shape public opinion and policy : the editors at your school paper , the leaders in your student government , your city council , your mayor , you state elected officials .
Talk to these folks , and keep talking to these folks .
And if they wo n’t listen to you then become one of them .
Join the school paper ; run for student government ; run for city council .
If not you , then who ?
Here ’s something else I want you to do to help bring about an end to marijuana prohibition .
There ’s something I want you all to say when you are engaging in your outreach efforts , and that is this : NOT IN MY NAME .
You know , when those who support marijuana prohibition are forced to defend it , they do so by saying that it ’s all about you : it ’s all about protecting and providing for the best interest of young people .
You know , sort of like “ we have to destroy the village in order to to save it . ”
It ’s time for all of you in this room to stop being the scapegoats for the abuses and the excesses of drug war .
It ’s time to say : enough !
We do n’t want your criminal policies ; we never asked for your criminal policies ; and we ’re tired of having our good names be used to support your failed drug war .
The war on marijuana is n’t saving us ; it ’s harming us , and we demand that it comes to end before it destroys another generations the same way it has destroyed ours .
Okay , so that ’s the easy part – here ’s the hard part .
If students – and I ’m talking about you guys here , and I ’m also talking about all of your friends and colleagues who are n’t here – really are going to be the game - changers in this battle , this fight that all of us sitting up here have been waging for far too long already , then we need for you guys to take a pledge :
Do n’t let your activism be a phase in your life ; make it a part of your life .
When I graduated college in 1994 there was no SSDP ; there was no ASA .
There barely was an MPP .
There was the DPA – with one office a handful of employees .
There was no LEAP , no SAFER ; no frankly there was no professional movement .
Since then the landscape has changed monumentally .
Today , there are now dozens of organizations working on drug policy reform , and with that , dozens of job opportunities for you to get involved and stay involved in marijuana policy after you graduate college .
So I give you a challenge :
You really want to end the drug war ?
Consider making drug policy your career choice .
You can start right now by applying for an internship at NORML or a fellowship at SSDP .
Many of this movement ’s current leaders started out this way , Kris Krane , Mason Tvert , Tom Angel , Stacia Cosner , Micah Daigle , and many others .
They did it , and you can too .
Finally , even if you do n’t wish to pursue marijuana law reform as a career , I encourage you to stay active in the movement .
Between the Internet , podcasts , list - servs , social networking sites like Facebook , you now have access to unparalleled quantities of drug - law reform information in real time .
Just this past week NORML launched its own Iphone app .
In other words , it is now easier than ever to stay plugged in to your networks and continue to educate yourself and your friends about drug policy reform .
Check out NORML ’s daily podcast , the Audio Stash , for the latest breaking news , or check out NORML ’s capwiz page to instantly learn about upcoming state and federal votes in legislation that affects us all .
And use what you learn to continue to move this conversation forward .
The bottom line : all of you in this room have the power to change these laws , and today you have an unprecedented opportunity to do so .
So get out there and do it !

Oven - fresh bread is one of life ’s simple joys .
Ciabatta , a crisp - crusted Italian bread with hints of sourdough and loads of crannies longing for butter , is one of the easiest breads to make at home .
Why are we talking about baking bread on Lifehack ?
Because kitchen hacks are n’t just impressive , they often have very tasty results !
In this instance , I ’m going to show you how to make ciabatta with less than one minute of prep time .
How is that possible ?
Like many great hacks , this one uses simple ingredients and as few steps as possible to get the job done .
You may have heard of “ no - knead ” bread before .
Mark Bittman and many others have promoted their versions of an artisan bread that does n’t require any heavy labor .
While those recipes also create delicious results , they involve too many steps to be considered a real hack .
I wanted something very , very simple that delivered great results in 60 seconds of prep time or less .
It may take you a few tries to get below the one - minute mark , but I think you ’ll enjoy the results every time !
For your ciabatta you ’ll need :
Advertising
4 cups of all - purpose flour ( do NOT pack the flour into the measuring cup )
2 cups of warm water
1 teaspoon of salt
1/4 teaspoon of granulated yeast ( or equivalent )
For the gorgeous readers needing metric equivalents of this recipe , Toon left a comment with the following conversion :
500 grams of all - purpose flour
4,7 deciliter of warm water
4 grams of salt ( = 1 teaspoon = 5 ml )
1 gram of dry yeast ( = 1/4 teaspoon = 1,25 ml )
You ’ll also need a medium - size mixing bowl , a 10 × 15 cookie sheet or baking stone , a hand towel or plastic wrap , and whatever you ’d like to keep your bread from sticking ( if you ’re using a pan , I use flour and corn meal ) .
Have everything handy ?
Good .
Let ’s do this !
1. Mix Water & Yeast
Pour the warm water into the medium - size mixing bowl and stir in the yeast with a spoon .
No need to be particular , just dump and slosh .
2. Add Flour And Salt
Add flour and salt to your bowl of yeasty water .
This , after measuring out the flour , presents another prime opportunity to get flour on your person .
This will be regarded by many as a sign of your culinary determination .
You ’ll need such signs because anybody who actually watches you make the bread will think you ’re one of the laziest bakers in existence .

3. Stir Into A Heavy Batter
Use a spoon .
You could use your hands if you wanted but you probably did n’t wash your hands before starting this anyhow .
Start with a quick run about around the perimeter of the bowl with your spoon .
A few quick strokes through the middle and you should have a heavy batter .
If it looks too thick to be pancake batter and not thick enough to be playdough , you ’re right on target .
4. Set It And Nearly Forget It
Cover your project with a hand towel or plastic wrap and set in a safe place for a few hours .
After the dough has rested for 8 to 12 hours , it will have nearly doubled in size .
( If you add a bit of sugar at the start and you ’re in a hurry , you can rush this process but I do n’t recommend it for your first try . )
5. Preheat Oven & Prepare Your Pan
There ’s a lot of room for variation at this stage .
The goal is to place the dough onto a surface that will keep it from falling through the oven rack and not stick on .
I use an old cookie sheet sprinkled with flour and corn meal .
You can use a buttered pan , pizza stone , or baking paper .
It ’s up to you .
The flour / cornmeal method takes only a few seconds .
Before you start prepping your pan / stone , set your oven to 400 F .
( For those of you using wood stoves , do n’t stress the particulars .
Pull a few cedar shingles off the back porch roof and get that fire burning hot ! )

6. Pour Out The Batter
This is the fun part !
Uncover the bowl of dough and slowly pour it out onto the pan you just prepared for it .
You ’ll want to use a spoon to guide the dough into place and get the last bits out of the bowl .
The dough will be very wet and sticky .
That ’s okay !
Get the dough out onto the pan and if you ’re lucky , it ’ll look something like this :
7. Add Spices ( If Needed ) & Place Bread Into 400F Oven
If you ’re trying to stay within the one - minute prep , you probably wo n’t have time to sprinkle some of your favorite herbs onto your ciabatta before baking .
If you ’re not worried about time , some dried oregano , basil , and rosemary make a nice addition .
8. Remove Your Ciabatta From The Oven
Check on your ciabatta after about 25 minutes .
Once it ’s golden brown on top and looks good to eat , take it out of the oven and set it aside to cool for at least 10 minutes .
You can cut into it immediately but if you do it ’ll collapse and wo n’t look as pretty .
Wait !
You really thought I wanted you to take a hot pan out of a 400 F oven without some sort of protection ?
Craziness !
If you do n’t have an oven mitt handy , take off your shirt , fold it so there will be at least 6 layers of cloth protecting your hand , remove the pan from the oven and place in a safe spot to cool .
Advertising
9. Slice & Enjoy
Move your ciabatta off the pan or baking stone and onto a proper cutting board for demolition and devouring .
Ciabatta is famous as a sandwich bread but , like most breads , it ’s absolutely delicious right out of the oven .

It was just a single contract for a single job on a single base in Iraq .
The Department of Defense agreed to pay the megacontractor KBR $ 5 million a year to repair tactical vehicles , from Humvees to big rigs , at Joint Base Balad , a large airfield and supply center north of Baghdad .
Yet according to a new Pentagon report [ PDF ] , what the military got was as many as 144 civilian mechanics , each doing as little as 43 minutes of work a month , with virtually no oversight .
The report , issued March 3 by the DOD ’s inspector general , found that between late 2008 and mid-2009 , KBR performed less than 7 percent of the work it was expected to do , but still got paid in full .
The $ 4.6 million blown on this particular contract is a relatively small loss considering that in 2009 alone , the government had a blanket deal worth $ 5 billion with KBR ( formerly known as the Halliburton subsidiary Kellogg Brown & Root ) .
Just days before the Pentagon released the Balad report , KBR announced it had won a new $ 2.3 billion - plus , five - year Iraq contract .
But the inspector general ’s modest investigation offers new insight into just how little KBR delivers and how toothless the Pentagon is to prevent contractor waste .
Moreover , the government ’s own auditors predict that as the military draws down its forces in Iraq , KBR will keep most of its workforce intact , enabling it to collect $ 190 million or more in unnecessary expenses .
Much of any “ peace dividend ” from the war ’s gradual end — potentially hundreds of billions of dollars — could wind up in the hands of contractors .
On March 29 , the bipartisan Commission on Wartime Contracting — which Congress set up in early 2007 to investigate waste and corruption in the military private sector — will hold a hearing to examine whether contractors are doing their part to prepare for leaving Iraq .
Some commissioners are raring for a showdown with KBR over its drawdown plan — or lack thereof .
The commission ’s co-chair , former Republican congressman Christopher H. Shays , said in a statement : “ Considering that KBR was just awarded a task order — now under protest — that could bring them up to $ 2.3 billion in new [ Iraq - related ] revenues , it ’s very important that we get a clear picture of the quality of planning and oversight during the Iraq drawdown . ”
The Balad report is likely to be a hot potato at the hearing .
Commissioner Charles Tiefer tells Mother Jones the report is a “ dynamite critique ” of the firm ’s practices .
“ The numbers translate into an astonishingly large pool of KBR employees standing around idle and having the government be charged , ” he says .
What the DOD investigators found in Balad was astounding .
Army rules require that its civilian maintenance employees are actively working 85 to 90 percent of the time they are on the clock .
Yet KBR ’s own records showed that its workers were only engaged in labor an average of 6.6 percent of the time they were on duty .
The DOD ran its own numbers , and its findings were even worse .
In September 2008 , for example , KBR had 144 maintenance employees at Balad , available to work 16,200 hours .
Their actual “ utilization rate ” was a paltry 0.63 percent — which means that each of the 144 KBR employees averaged about 43 minutes of work for the entire month .
How did such a large bunch of thumb - twiddling mechanics go unnoticed ?
The Pentagon investigators found that the Army had no system in place to police how much work its contractors were actually doing .
Plus , the unit in charge of KBR ’s operation at Balad reported that the contractor would n’t reveal how many mechanics it employed there “ because it believed the information was proprietary . ”
The investigators ( who eventually got the KBR data ) note that as of last August , the number of KBR mechanics at Balad has since dropped to 75 , but they conclude diplomatically that “ opportunities for additional reductions of tactical vehicle field maintenance services at [ Balad ] may exist , which may provide additional cost savings to DOD . ”
In other words , the Army should consider sending even more contractors home .
Some in the military appear to accept such waste as a matter of course .
Col. Gust Pagonis , an assistant chief of staff for the 13th Expeditionary Sustainment Command , which took over command of Balad last August , responded to the DOD inspector general by explaining that “ the contracting of maintenance capabilities , though not efficient , was effective in ensuring units did not experience low readiness rates and being able to perform the mission . ”
Translation :
The KBR contractors were essentially being kept around on reserve , just in case .
Tiefer does n’t buy that argument .
“ That might justify a limited overcapacity , but nothing approaching KBR ’s levels , ” he says .
As the military draws down its own numbers in Iraq , that “ just in case ” fleet shows few signs of going home .
By this August , all US combat personnel are slated to be out of Iraq , leaving a force of about 50,000 “ combat support ” troops .
Yet if the DOD ’s own optimistic estimates are accurate , there will still be 75,000 contractors in Iraq at the end of summer — or 1.5 contractors for every soldier .
KBR had 17,095 employees in Iraq as of last September , but when its subcontractors are included , it oversees as many as 58,000 workers .
The firm has promised to reduce its staff in Iraq by 5 percent each quarter , but that may not be fast enough .
Last November , April G. Stephenson , the then - head of the Defense Contract Audit Agency ( DCAA ) , testified to the contracting commission that KBR could cost the government another $ 193 million in unnecessary manpower between then and the August 2010 withdrawal date for combat forces .
“ When the military reduced its troop levels from 160,000 to 130,000 — a 19 percent reduction — KBR ’s staffing levels remained constant , ” she told the commission , adding that KBR had so far refused to share “ a detailed , written plan to reduce staffing levels in consonance with the military drawdown . ”
She added that the $ 193 million estimate was “ conservative ” ; if KBR fails to meet its withdrawal goals , the price tag could balloon by hundreds of millions more .
“ The drawdown in Iraq and these Iraq task orders are going to become a deep pocket for these contractors , ” she told the panel .
In light of the Balad report , Tiefer cautiously agrees .
“ If KBR has underutilized rates in many of its operations anywhere near the rates found by the inspector general study … that would support a search for savings on the order of $ 300 million , ” he says .
KBR rejects those assertions .
The company has “ been working since last year with these organizations in responsibly planning our support to the drawdown of military forces in Iraq , ” writes company spokeswoman Heather Browne in an email to Mother Jones .
Federal bean counters are concerned with more than just KBR ’s inflated contracts .
In fiscal 2009 alone , the DCAA identified $ 20.4 billion in questionable billing , and another $ 12.1 billion in unsupported cost estimates , by contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Together , that ’s more money than any individual handout to the biggest beneficiaries of the financial bailout .
In October , the Pentagon transferred Stephenson to its payroll department .
That move came after the Government Accountability Office complained about auditing irregularities on Stephenson ’s watch .
GAO even alleged that some DCAA reports had been modified to favor contractors — which suggests that the companies ’ waste in Iraq and Afghanistan may be even worse than already known .
( Stephenson could not be reached for comment . )
But even before her demotion , Stephenson ’s agency had little leverage with contractors .
All the DCAA can do is make recommendations to an alphabet soup of other Pentagon bureaucracies that routinely insist that contracts and regulations prevent them from playing hardball with contractors and their paychecks .
At the November hearing , Shays , the co-chair of the contracting commission , chastised a Defense Contract Management Agency representative for failing to withhold any payments to contractors — even after the DCAA had expressed doubts about the amounts the contractors were charging .
“ It is simply outrageous that DCMA did not respond to DCAA ’s findings and have any withholds , ” Shays said .
“ And it was unfortunate that DCAA did not have a way to see that resolved . ”
The DOD ’s inertia on contractor accountability is so complete that its agencies can’t say with any certainty how many contractors are currently in Iraq and Afghanistan .
One April 2009 estimate put the number at 160,000 ; a separate DOD study a month earlier said it was 240,000 .
The dysfunction has angered some Iraq War hawks , like Shays and contracting commission member Dov Zakheim — a Bush - era undersecretary of defense who helped manage the war ’s initial finances .
Zakheim upbraided several Pentagon officials in that November hearing for not keeping contractors accountable .
“ We ’ve been at war for eight years in Afghanistan , long enough for me to actually start forgetting about what it was like at the beginning , when I was there , ” he said .
“ Eight years in Afghanistan , and we have n’t resolved something like this , which I would have thought is absolutely critical . ”
But KBR will be in the hot seat at next week ’s hearing — and on the heels of the Balad report , that seat ’s now likely to be a lot hotter .
“ We ’re hoping to find out at this hearing how much progress KBR has made toward a viable drawdown plan with realistic assumptions , ” Tiefer says , adding : “ I ’m personally hoping to receive suggestions for how to reform monopoly cost - plus contracts like KBR’s . ”
Company spokeswoman Browne says KBR is ready to state its case , and is in the process of drafting a response to the inspector general ’s report .
For now , however , it ’s hard to see what the commission or the federal government can do to derail the KBR gravy train .
Bases across Iraq remain dependent on the firm ’s contractors , and that dependency is only likely to increase as more troops come home .
“ In essence …we basically said that KBR is too big to fail , ” Shays said last May .
“ So we are still going to fund them . ”

Let ’s take a look at the Top 20 prospects for 2010 .
Keep in mind , this list is meant look at the players with the best opportunity to make an impact for fantasy owners in 2010 .
With that said , away we go ( the entire list is Top 50 , which is available to those who purchase the Rotoprofessor 2010 Fantasy Baseball Draft Guide for just $ 5 ) :
Jason Heyward – Atlanta Braves – 20 – OF
He is among the best prospects in the game , but at 20 - years old you have to wonder if the team will push him to the Major Leagues or give him more time to develop at Triple - A. Considering he ’s had just 173 AB above Single - A , I would n’t expect him to break camp with the team .
Even when he gets there , he has the potential to struggle , though he has shown signs of greatness .
He has n’t developed his power yet , though it is coming along ( his flyball rate continues to improve , up to 37.5 % last season leading to 17 HR ) .
His average in 2009 was buoyed by a tremendous BABIP ( .346 ) .
Is that impossible to see him repeat ?
He ’s got all the talent and certainly is worth taking a flyer on , as he is the premier prospect in the game .
Stephen Strasburg – Washington Nationals – 21 – SP
There are a ton of questions on if he will break camp with the Nationals or not , but when you have a pitcher armed with a 100 mph fastball on the fast track , all owners must take notice .
He has the potential to be among the elite as soon as 2011 .
Madison Bumgarner – San Francisco Giants – 20 – SP
With Randy Johnson ’s retirement , Bumgarner assumes the fifth starter duties in San Francisco .
After going 12 - 2 with a 1.85 ERA over 131.1 innings ( 9 - 1 with a 1.93 ERA at Double - A ) , he has little to prove in the Minor Leagues .
He ’s not going to bring elite strikeouts ( at least not yet , with just 92 in the Minor Leagues ) , but he certainly has the stuff and the position to be successful .
Neftali Feliz – Texas Rangers – 21 – SP
He ’s proven what he can do in a Major League bullpen ( 1.74 ERA , 11.32 K/9 over 20 relief appearances ) , but will the Rangers give him a chance to open the season in the rotation ?
We ’ve seen a similar situation with Joba Chamberlain and the Yankees , but I do n’t see the Rangers repeating their mistakes .
I ’m thinking the Rangers will utilize him in both roles , depending on the number of innings they want to allow him to throw , meaning he ’s likely to be worth using at some point in 2010 .
As it is , with his arm , even if he ’s in setup duty , he ’s going to have some value .
Brian Matusz – Baltimore Orioles – 22 – SP
The Orioles 2008 first round draft pick , Matusz wasted no time flying through the system and reaching the Majors in 2009 .
He may have struggled at times ( 4.63 ERA and 1.48 WHIP over 44.2 innings ) , but do n’t be misled .
He was hindered by a .343 BABIP , certainly showing that a lot of his problems were related to bad luck .
He ’s got tremendous upside and should spend the season in the Baltimore rotation .
You are going to watch him closely against the AL East foes , but against others he easily could prove usable .
Wade Davis – Tampa Bay Rays – 23 – SP
After exploding onto the scene in 2009 ( 3.72 ERA , 1.27 WHIP , 8.92 K/9 ) , he has the inside track on the Rays fifth starter spot to open the season .
For his minor league career he had a 3.29 ERA , 1.26 WHIP and 8.7 K/9 , so his success should not be all that surprising .
While facing the Red Sox and Yankees on a regular basis is a scary thought , he will have the opportunity and ability to thrive in his rookie campaign .
Alcides Escobar – Milwaukee Brewers – 23 – SS
One of the new “ big three ” shortstops and has as much talent as any of them , though the big question is where he will bat in the Brewers lineup and if they actually take the handcuffs off and allow him to run wild , utilizing his immense speed ( 42 SB in 430 AB at Triple - A in ’09 ) .
He ’s guaranteed to start , with J.J. Hardy shipped to Minnesota , meaning he is worth using in all formats .
Carlos Santana – Cleveland Indians – 23 – C
He has the potential to be among the best hitting catchers in the game .
Can you imagine that the Dodgers were willing to part with him as part of the Casey Blake trade ?
He hit .290 with 23 HR , 97 RBI and 91 R at Double - A in ’09 and considering Lou Marson is now all that stands in his way , it ’s just a matter of time before he makes a major impact in ’ 10 .
Daniel Hudson – Chicago White Sox – 23 – SP
This ranking may be a bit aggressive , but the 2008 fifth round draft pick is on the fast track .
He was impressive in 2009 , posting a 2.32 ERA over 147.1 minor league innings ( including a 1.60 ERA in nine Double - A starts ) .
He has impeccable control and while Freddy Garcia may break camp with the White Sox , it ’s just a matter of time before Hudson assumes the role .
Aroldis Chapman – Cincinnati Reds – 24 – SP
We all know his story at this point , big arm but does he have the control to excel ?
While he may not open the season in the Reds rotation , you do n’t give a pitcher that big of a contract if you do n’t plan on using him .
He ’ll be in the Reds rotation at some point in 2010 .
Scott Sizemore – Detroit Tigers – 25 – 2B
He ’s in line to open the season as the Tigers starting second baseman , which immediately makes him a player to target .
He may not produce overwhelming statistics , but he ’s a solid option as a middle infielder thanks to his potential to go 10/10 with a solid average .
Pedro Alvarez – Pittsburgh Pirates – 23 – 3B
The perennially rebuilding Pirates easily could turn to their 2008 First Round Pick at some point in 2010 .
He reached Double - A in his first pro season , hitting .333 with 13 HR and 40 RBI in 222 AB ( though the average came courtesy of a .407 BABIP ) .
Overall he hit 27 HR with 95 RBI in 465 AB ( while hitting .288 ) .
He has a ton of potential , though the strikeouts ( 26.6 % at Double - A ) will likely make it difficult for him to hit for a good average initially .
Still , with Andy LaRoche the only thing standing in his way , he ’s going to get a shot at some point in ’ 10 .
Justin Smoak – Texas Rangers – 23 – 1B
The only thing blocking his way of potentially making an impact is a slow start from Chris Davis .
How unlikely does that seem ?
However , after hitting just .244 with 4 HR in 197 AB in the high - powered Pacific Coast League , he has his own concerns hanging over his head .
Brett Wallace – Toronto Blue Jays – 23 – 3B
He is in - line to open the season as the Blue Jays DH , but the power has not yet developed ( 28 career minor league HR in 755 AB ) .
He also does n’t appear likely to hit for an extreme average , meaning he ’s a marginal option at best .
Desmond Jennings – Tampa Bay Rays – 23 – OF
He could produce a similar line to Carl Crawford ( in just 115 AB at Triple - A he hit .325 with 3 HR and 15 SB in ’09 ) .
That really should tell fantasy owners all they need to know about him .
It ’s debatable if he ’s the best OF prospect or not , but without a doubt he ’s a top prospect for 2010 .
With Matt Joyce and Gabe Kapler all that ’s standing in his way , it is just a matter of time , at least you ’d think .
Unfortunately , at this point , word is that it will take something extraordinary to get him into the lineup in 2010 , so time will tell .
Chris Carter – Oakland Athletics – 23 – 1B
Earlier in the offseason it appeared that Carter could break camp with the team , but their moves may have put a slight kink in those plans .
There are only so many available positions and with the slew of outfielders , Kevin Kouzmanoff , Jake Fox and Jack Cust all looking for AB , it ’s likely someone ( probably Fox ) opens the season at 1B .
His power makes him worth monitoring , however , because it may just be a matter of time .
At Double - A he hit .337 with 24 HR , 101 RBI , 108 R in just 490 AB .
Austin Jackson – Detroit Tigers – 23 – OF
The opportunity is going to be there , thanks to being shipped to Detroit in exchange for Curtis Granderson .
Is he going to be successful , however ?
I ’ve never been the biggest fan of his as there as several questions surrounding his bat .
He has little power .
He strikes out way too much ( 24.4 % strikeout rate at Triple - A in ’09 ) .
He ’s got speed , but that ’s just not enough to make him a solid gamble .
Think Cameron Maybin , meaning it ’s going to take some time for him to potentially reach his full potential .
Buster Posey – San Francisco Giants – 23 – C
Had Bengie Molina not resigned with the Giants , Posey would have been a sure fire Top 10 prospect , even without the power potential .
Now , once again being completely blocked , he ’s ticketed for full - time duty at Triple - A unless the Giants need a spark ( or an injury necessitates playing time ) .
If you are looking for help in 2010 , he ’s just not the answer anymore .
Jeremy Hellickson – Tampa Bay Rays – 22 – SP
Wade Davis gets the attention given his production in 2009 , but Hellickson has just as much upside , all he needs is the opportunity to succeed .
Over his Minor League career ( 461.0 innings ) he ’s posted a 2.71 ERA , 1.02 WHIP and 9.9 K/9 .
In any other organization he’d be given his chance out of Spring Training .
In Tampa Bay , he ’ll just have to bide his time .
Gaby Sanchez – Florida Marlins – 26 – 1B
The Marlins did not address their gaping hole at 1B , meaning that one of their two young prospects will get a chance to break camp with the team .
Having already gotten a cup of coffee with the squad , it would appear Sanchez gets the first look .
He makes good contact , giving him a chance to hit for a decent average , but there is n’t much power there to get you excited about .
What are your thoughts on this list ?
Who was left off ?
Who is ranked too high ?

In September last year we reported on the sale of Cameron ’s house from Ferris Bueller ’s Day Off but sadly the Ferrari featured in the film did not come with the sale .
Now though you have the chance to own this Ferrari for just £ 30000 - 40000 .
The car is an iconic vehicle from 80s American cinema and £ 40000 probably is n’t that much if you ’re a huge Ferris fan .
Imagine calling in sick to work and taking this Ferrari out for a drive .
The listing on Bonhams website has further details on the car :
Only around one hundred genuine 250GT Spyder California ’s were created by Ferrari between 1958 and 1963 .
Existing examples are very rare and expensive so Paramount chose to commission and build a replica for filming purposes .
Styled by Pininfarina , the classic lines of the car combine elegance and aggression , and it ranks alongside the Lusso as the ultimate expression of the Ferrari 250 GT family .
It was also a highly capable competition machine , as was demonstrated by Ginther / Hively winning their class at the Sebring 12 Hours in March 1958 on their way to finishing 9th overall , and Grossman / Tavano finishing 5th overall at Le Mans in June .

Las reformas antiabortistas promovidas en varias entidades del pa�s son un retroceso y un paso en el sentido equivocado para el desarrollo de los derechos humanos de la poblaci�n femenina , consider � Madgy Mart�nez - Solim�n , coordinador residente del Sistema de Naciones Unidas en M�xico .
“ Como lo coment � el a�o pasado y como lo vuelvo a decir : creemos que esas modificaciones constitucionales son un retroceso y un paso en el sentido equivocado ” , dijo .

Gimmick No. 1 is the way the bill front - loads revenues and backloads spending .
That is , the taxes and fees it calls for are set to begin immediately , but its new subsidies would be deferred so that the first 10 years of revenue would be used to pay for only 6 years of spending .
Even worse , some costs are left out entirely .
To operate the new programs over the first 10 years , future Congresses would need to vote for $ 114 billion in additional annual spending .
But this so - called discretionary spending is excluded from the Congressional Budget Office ’s tabulation .
Consider , too , the fate of the $ 70 billion in premiums expected to be raised in the first 10 years for the legislation ’s new long - term health care insurance program .
This money is counted as deficit reduction , but the benefits it is intended to finance are assumed not to materialize in the first 10 years , so they appear nowhere in the cost of the legislation .
Another vivid example of how the legislation manipulates revenues is the provision to have corporations deposit $ 8 billion in higher estimated tax payments in 2014 , thereby meeting fiscal targets for the first five years .
But since the corporations ’ actual taxes would be unchanged , the money would need to be refunded the next year .
The net effect is simply to shift dollars from 2015 to 2014 .
In addition to this accounting sleight of hand , the legislation would blithely rob Peter to pay Paul .
For example , it would use $ 53 billion in anticipated higher Social Security taxes to offset health care spending .
Social Security revenues are expected to rise as employers shift from paying for health insurance to paying higher wages .
But if workers have higher wages , they will also qualify for increased Social Security benefits when they retire .
So the extra money raised from payroll taxes is already spoken for .
( Indeed , it is unlikely to be enough to keep Social Security solvent . )
It can not be used for lowering the deficit .
The Senate Republicans are like willful children : " You ca n't make me ! "
They obstruct , for obstruction 's sake and here 's a perfect example from Right Wing Watch :
If you need any more proof that Senate Republicans ' sole mission at the moment is to prevent anything from happening in their chamber of Congress , look no further than the fact that today the Senate had to seek cloture on the nomination Barbara Milano Keenan to fill a vacancy on the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals , resulting in a vote of 99-0 .
That 's right - not one Republican senator spoke against her qualifications , record , or views or voted to prevent her nomination from receiving an up - or - down vote on the Senate floor ... and yet still they filibustered , forcing Democrats to seek a cloture vote in order to move ahead , simply because they are committed to obstructing the governing process in every way possible .
Earlier today , Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy took to the Senate floor to blast the Republicans ' refusal to allow the Senate to move on even noncontroversial judicial nominations :

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Sentiment of U.S. households in the top fifth of the income distribution improved in early 2010 compared with 2009 , but worries over personal finances persist , a survey showed on Friday .
Sentiment rose to 82.8 for 2010 compared with 71.5 for 2009 , according to the Thomson Reuters / University of Michigan ’s Surveys of Consumers .
The survey assessed upper - income households .
Some 36 percent reported an improved financial situation in early 2010 , up from 27 percent last year ; however , 38 percent reported a worsening financial situation , down from 51 percent in 2009 .
“ While the evidence indicates that the financial situation of upper - income households improved considerably more than the finances of lower - income households , even among those in the top fifth of the income distribution , those initial gains have not completely ended the overall financial decline , ” said Richard Curtin , director of the surveys .
Last week , a separate Thomson Reuters / University of Michigan survey found that U.S. consumer sentiment was weaker in February compared with January , as Americans grew more impatient with the government ’s gridlock over efforts to stimulate jobs .

“ We tried to preserve a reasonable balance , ” said Mr. Wetzler , now a director at the firm Deloitte Tax .
“ We wanted to avoid imposing onerous burdens on people just for us to collect small amounts of revenue . ”
But now states have greater access to data warehouses that help them better track taxes owed .
Real estate transactions , federal data from the Internal Revenue Service , commercial license plates , traffic tickets , bids for government construction projects — all this information , newly digitized and dumped into a computer system , can help states find tax scofflaws .
“ We ’re sort of getting into ‘ 1984 ’ land here , ” said Kenneth T. Zemsky , an accountant and partner at Ernst & Young .
“ A lot of the reason they went after athletes and entertainers is that they could n’t find the other people .
Now they ’re able to get those people , too . ”
Still , perhaps the best enforcement mechanism may be requiring companies to withhold additional taxes from their employees ’ paychecks .
State auditors may not be able to monitor every border - crossing , but with corporate payroll managers as their enforcers , they do n’t need to .
“ Our employees call me the ‘ Tax Nazi , ’ ” says Dee Nelson , the corporate payroll manager at the Koniag Development Corporation , a government contractor that works on military projects .
“ They get really angry at me when we withhold their pay if they do a project in Utah or wherever .
And I have to explain this is the law , not me just trying to be a bully . ”
Ms. Nelson ’s employer is based in Anchorage , but at any given time its employees are generally working in five states with five different withholding requirements .
She estimates that the administrative work required for managing multistate employees adds about 10 percent to the cost of each project .
Many Fortune 500 companies contacted for this article privately acknowledged having been slightly less vigilant than Ms. Nelson about tracking the minute - by - minute movements of their thousands of employees in the past .
But these companies also say that they have been subjected to payroll audits more frequently in the last few years and that tax officials have requested travel logs for highly paid employees during these audits .
I may have to de-friend Facebook 's green data center .
The Prineville , Ore. , facility the company announced at the end of last month , received kudos and accolades for its innovative and dedicatedly green features , including a low - energy evaporative cooling system , an airside economizer for using outside air to cool the facility , a system to re-use of server heat , and a target of hitting a PUE of 1.15 .
But at least some of the power going in to the data center will be from a notoriously non-green energy source : Coal .
Not even " clean coal , " just coal .
The company is under fire in the media and on Facebook , with online activist website Change.org launching a petition to " Stop Facebook from Switching to Dirty Coal . "
The complaints arise from the fact that Facebook has contracted with PacifiCorp subsidiary Pacific Power to supply the energy for the facility .
As reported on SearchDataCenter.com , " While Pacific Power gets some hydropower from [ the hydroelectric generator Bonneville Power Administration ] , its primary power - generation fuel is coal , according to Jason Carr , the manager of the Prineville office of economic development for Central Oregon . "
Some of the largest tech companies have sited their data centers in the same region where Facebook plans to build , and one of the primary drivers for those choices is that hydroelectric power comes in large quantities and rock - bottom prices from dams on the Columbia River .
( When it comes to energy , green is , as with so much in IT , an auxiliary benefit and a side note to saving serious money . )
And this is the first time I 've heard a data center criticized for the energy used to power their facility , so while it 's perhaps not undeserved , it could also be a case of a company getting dinged for sharing too much information .
In response to the mini-uproar , a Facebook representative commented on DataCenter Knowledge , saying in full :
I 'm writing on behalf of Facebook to share their response to the issues you 've posed .
Most electrical commercial and residential power in the United States comes from a variety of sources .
Our new data center will be receiving our power through PacifiCorp , which like most utilities has a diverse generation portfolio including hydro , geothermal , wind and coal .
PacifiCorp is now the # 1 utility owner operator of renewables , having grown their portfolio 2,400 percent over the past three years .
When it comes online in early 2011 , the new Facebook data center will also be one of the most energy efficient in the world , featuring an innovative cooling system created for the unique climate characteristics in Prineville , Oregon .
The new , world class energy - efficiency technologies the Facebook data center will utilize include an evaporative cooling system ; an airside economizer that will bring colder air in from the outside ; re-use of server heat to warm office space in the colder months ; and new patent pending highly efficient electrical design will reduce electricity usage by up to 12 percent .
The entire facility will be built to LEED Gold standards .
The State of Oregon has a very aggressive Renewable Portfolio Standard , calling for 25 percent of power in the state to be produced by renewable resources by 2025 .
Facebook believes this policy will ensure continued growth of renewable generation resources .
Facebook 's commitment is , regardless of generation source , to use electricity as wisely and as efficiently as possible .
Maybe FB is getting more heat than it deserves for this revelation , or maybe it is simply on the early end of an increase in concern about what powers the servers that power the internet .
I 'd love to hear your thoughts in the comments , and I 'll be sure to look at the energy mix for future green data centers that pop up on my radar .
Update : McCain defends Palin ’s word choice : “ Those are fine .
They ’re used all the time . ”
Since the passage of health care reform last weekend , there has been increasingly violent language coming from opponents of the legislation , along with vandalism directed at Democratic members of Congress .
Former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin has now done her part to raise the rhetorical intensity , telling her Twitter followers , “ Commonsense Conservatives & lovers of America : ‘ Do n’t Retreat , Instead – RELOAD ! ' ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Palin then refers supporters to her Facebook page , where she once again employs gun imagery in offering a list of 20 potentially vulnerable pro-reform Democrats in Congress .
“ WeÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢re paying particular attention to those House members who voted in favor of Obamacare and represent districts that Senator John McCain and I carried during the 2008 election , ” Palin writes .
“ WeÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ll aim for these races and many others . ”
This is followed by a map of the United States showing gun crosshairs over the targeted districts .
Commentators from the left have reacted with alarm to what might be taken as an incitement to violence .
“ Most ( but probably not all ) Palin supporters may insist the tuckered - out former Alaska governor meant ‘ reload ’ metaphorically , ” notes Salon ’s Joan Walsh .
“ But in a country where angry right - wingers carry guns to see the president speak , and spit on African - American congressmen , I thought it was a chilling statement .
Will any Republican denounce Palin ’s language ? ”
“ I ’m not one who believes she ’s trying to incite violence , ” MSBNC ’s Lawrence O’Donnell insisted on Tuesday .
“ I ’d have to give her a very big benefit of the doubt that this is what it sounds like when you ’re a hunter from Alaska . ”
He was concerned , however , that even if Palin ’s gun imagery was inadvertent , it could still have a negative effect .
“ Is she just out of it ? ” he asked Professor Melissa Harris - Lacewell .
“ Or is this an indication that this movement actually likes to move into that provocative direction ? ”

“ There should be a kind of carefulness about people in public life , ” Harris - Lacewell replied .
“ I think that this is part of what Sarah Palin made a decision to do when she quit the role of an elected leader .
…
She went rogue . …
And yet this notion that she has so little responsibility that she would use crosshairs to talk about … ”
Harris - Lacewell then trailed off without completing the thought .
Update : asked Senator John McCain whether Palin should perhaps have used “ less incendiary language . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
McCain ’s laughing response was , “ ” I have seen the rhetoric of ‘ targeted districts ’ as long as I ’ve been in politics . …
To say that there ’s a targeted district or that we ‘ reload ’ or ‘ got back into the fight again . ’
Please . …
Those are fine .
They ’re used all the time . ”

British National Party ( BNP ) leader Nick Griffin ( L ) arrives at BBC Television Centre , in west London October 22 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Tal Cohen
LONDON ( Reuters ) - The British National Party was banned on Friday from admitting new members until it complies with race equality laws , after a judge ruled its constitution was likely to discriminate against non-white people .
Last month , the far - right group scrapped its whites - only policy in an attempt to avoid legal sanctions from the Equality and Human Rights Commission ( EHRC ) .
But judge Paul Collins ruled its new rules , which still require new members to sign up to its principles , remain discriminatory .
“ The BNP are likely to commit unlawful acts of discrimination within section 1 b Race Relations
Act 1976 in the terms on which they are prepared to admit persons to membership .. , ” he said .
He issued an injunction ordering the BNP to comply with race equality laws .
“ The membership list will have to be closed until then , ” he told the hearing at Central London County Court .
Under the injunction , prospective BNP members will not in future have to be vetted at home before they are accepted .
A new study confirms that anesthesia is safe for normal mice but potentially harmful for mice with genetic risk factors for Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) .
Over several months , investigations have focused on analyzing the effects of the anesthesia in normal mice and in mice with mutations that produce AD .
The use of repetitive anesthesia with isoflurane ( one of the most common anesthetics by inhalation ) increases the risk of developing changes similar to those observed in AD brains in mice with mutations of the amyloid precursor protein ( APP ) .
This is the main conclusion of Spanish researchers coordinated by Doctors Maria Ángeles Mena and Justo García de Yébenes , from CIBERNED ( Centro de Investigación Biomédica en Red de Enfermedades Neurodegenerativas ) .
The work has been published in the Journal of Alzheimer 's Disease .
Other participants in the study are Juan Perucho , Isabel Rubio , María J. Casarejos , Ana Gómez , José A. Rodríguez - Navarro , Rosa M. Solano , from the Neurobiology and Neurology Departments at Hospital Ramón y Cajal in Madrid .
The findings suggest a possible mechanism of developing Alzheimer .
Some epidemiological studies have shown an increased prevalence of AD in patients undergoing anesthesia and surgery .
Doctor Justo García de Yébenes states that " before surgery requiring anesthesia , it may be ideal to know the genetic background of the patients so that the drugs used and the pattern of anesthesia may be personalized accordingly . "
The linkage between the repetitive use of isoflurane anesthesia and the development of AD changes in mice with mutations indicates the advisability of testing for genetic risk factors for AD in patients prior to surgery .
Until recently , the most important genetic risk factor for AD was the presence of the allele E4 of the apolipoprotein E , but recently other genetic polymorphisms of risks have been identified .
Once these polymorphisms of risks are identified and their relative impact on the pathogenesis of AD are known , a simple , automatic test for risk of AD should be performed in patients , namely the elderly , undergoing surgery under general anesthesia and the anesthetic procedure should be modified accordingly .
A personalized clinical model that would enable the reduction of the patient 's potential risk for AD would reduce the risk of anesthesia .
The study confirms that anesthesia is safe for normal mice but risky for asymptomatic carriers of mutations wich produce AD .
The research has been based on the application of anesthesia twice a week during three months in normal mice and in mice with mutations ( 7 - 10 months old ) that produce AD ( known as APPswe ) .
The results show alterations produced in the brain of mice with mutations very similar to those observed in patients that have already developed Alzheimer 's disease .
Study highlights :
Application of repetitive anesthesia in genetically altered mice increased their death rate .
Mutant mice showed less reactivity after anesthesia was over .
Their time for recovery after anesthesia was also increased .
Repetitive anesthesia produced persistent disorders affecting behavior of mutant mice .
Neuronal death increased in brain areas critical for cognition .
Increased inflammatory response and deposition of beta-amyloid peptides .
Isoflurane anesthesia of mutant mice altered the levels of chaperones ( proteins which regulate the processing of abnormal proteins )
AD usually is the main cause of dementia for people over 65 .
Currently , over 5 million people in the first world suffer from AD , a neurodegenerative pathology that lacks a specific diagnostic test .
The prevalence of this disease is also increasing in developing countries .
Currently , there is no therapy that stops or reverts the progression of AD , although there are several treatments that partially improve symptoms .
Researchers predict that Spain will experience a 75 % increase of AD patients in 25 years .
Memory loss , language problems , incapacity for decision making and discernment are some of the main traits of this disease .
Chilcot inquiry points out that Tony Blair , Jack Straw and Gordon Brown have given ' three rather different explanations ' , and asks foreign secretary to explain why he voted for war
Ministers have given the Iraq inquiry different reasons for the decision to go war , David Miliband was told today .
At the start of the foreign secretary 's evidence to the Chilcot panel , Sir Roderic Lyne , a member of the inquiry panel , said it had heard " three rather different explanations as to why we took military action against Iraq in 2003 " .
Tony Blair emphasised the need to impose regime change on Iraq , Lyne said .
But Jack Straw , the foreign secretary at the time of the war , stressed the importance of dealing with Iraq 's presumed weapons of mass destruction , Lyne said .
And Gordon Brown , when he gave evidence on Friday last week , said he supported the war because he thought the will of the international community had to be enforced .
Given the three views expressed by Blair , Straw and Brown , Lyne asked Miliband to explain why he voted for the war in March 2003 , when Miliband was a junior education minister .
Miliband replied : " I do not see the inconsistencies in the three sets of evidence that you describe . "
He said that , before he voted for war , he read one of the reports from Hans Blix , the UN weapons inspector , and he believed that established a " prima facie " case for Iraq having WMD .
In his evidence Blair said the inquiry should consider what would have happened if the Iraq war had not taken place .
He said that an Iraq still led by Saddam Hussein , competing with Iran to acquire WMD and support terrorism , could be an even greater threat today than Iraq was in 2003 .
Lyne asked Miliband if Blair 's analysis was correct .
Miliband said that this was a very important question but that it was " unanswerable " .
Miliband went on : " The authority of the UN would have been severely dented .
If , in the hypothetical case you are putting , we had marched to the top of the hill of pressure and marched down again without disarming Saddam Hussein , that would really have been quite damaging [ to the ability of the UN to work together ] . "
Miliband also insisted that the opposition to the Iraq war among the international community was not damaging British diplomacy today .
" I do not feel today , in the work I 'm doing at the Foreign Office and doing at the UN , that Iraq is thrown at us ...
It 's quite striking the extent to which the waters at New York [ where the UN is based ] close over and work carries on . "
Some countries respected Britain because of what happened in Iraq , he said .
" People in the region will respect those who will see through what they say they favour , even though they disagree with it , and would say to me : ' You have sent a message that when you say something , you actually mean it , ' " Miliband said .
The foreign secretary also told the inquiry panel that they should not learn the " wrong lesson " from the war .
" The wrong lesson would be that Britain should leave international engagement to others , " he said .
" We must not be a country that turns our back on the world .
Because if we do we will be much poorer as a result , in all senses of the world . "
Miliband , the foreign secretary since 2007 , will be the last minister to give evidence to the inquiry before the election .
In an interview published ahead of his appearance at the inquiry , Miliband said it would be " stupid " to pretend that the Iraq war had been a total success .
The foreign secretary said that history 's verdict on the war would be " balanced " , and said that it could take another six or seven years before the situation in Iraq stabilised .
Asked if he agreed with the proposition that the war was justified , Miliband told the Daily Telegraph : " That falls on two counts .
One , it is too glib about the loss of life and the reverses .
And it 's too black and white .
There 's a ledger , and it 's still being added to .
There is a positive and a negative .
It 's a balance , and history 's version will be a balanced judgment . "
Miliband said that he did not have " sleepless nights " about the war .
But that did not mean that he did not acknowledge the problems associated with it .
" There are hard questions to be asked of anyone who supported the war , " Miliband said .
" It would be stupid to pretend the balance is all on one side of the ledger .
We have n't lost the peace , but a lot of people have lost their lives …
It was much easier to win the war than the peace . "
Miliband described Iraq as a " post - conflict situation with quite a lot of conflict still going on " .
He said that the next six or seven years would be " absolutely critical " in deciding how Iraq developed .
He also insisted that Britain would not have gone to war if it had been known that Iraq did not have weapons of mass destruction .
" If there was convincing evidence there were no WMD , there would have been no UN resolution and ... no [ parliamentary ] vote . "
( CNN ) --
Wind power provides a fifth of Denmark 's electricity , most of it generated by giant wind farms built on land and in the country 's coastal waters .
But the tiny Danish island of Samso is proving bigger is n't necessarily better by generating all its electricity using wind turbines of its own .
Nineteen miles off the coast of mainland Denmark , 91 turbines reach 114 meters above the turbulent waters of the North Sea .
Together they form Horns Rev 2 , the world 's biggest offshore wind farm , which can generate enough electrify to power 200,000 homes .
Anders Eldrup is CEO of Dong Energy , which operates Horns Rev 2 .
He told CNN that Denmark 's trailblazing efforts in wind power are the result of the country 's energy crisis during the 1970s .
" The Danes were totally dependant on oil imported from the Middle East .
Suddenly there was an embargo , so no oil .
We learnt the lesson the hard way that you have to have diversified supplies of energy . "
The World Wind Energy Association says wind power currently provides 1.5 percent of the world 's electricity .
That 's a drop in the ocean , but as a clean and renewable source of energy , wind power is receiving support from governments around the world .
" I have to admit that the reason there is a business is that there are some government subsidies attached to wind production , " said Eldrup .
" That goes for Denmark and that goes for other European countries where we are doing wind operations . "
The U.S. government recently announced that its economic stimulus bill contributed to a 39 percent increase in the country 's wind power output last year , defying predictions that new wind energy output would decline because of harsh economic conditions .
" Small wind " is also being promoted , with governments encouraging individual households to produce their own wind power using micro turbines .
The United States offers a 30 percent investment tax credit to people who buy micro turbines .
Many other countries offer grants for installing turbines , as well as feed - in - tariff payments that allow individuals to sell the electricity they generate to their national grid network .
Are wind farms an underused source of clean energy , or a blot on the landscape ?
Leave your comments in the " Sound Off " box at the bottom of this article .
When it comes to small - scale renewable energy , the Danish island of Samso -- population 4,000 -- is an example to the world .
Among its energy - production facilities are 11 one - megawatt turbines on the island itself and 10 more turbines within three miles of its coast .
As well as using wind turbines to provide electricity , and straw - burning plants to provide heating , some islanders have solar panels on their roofs and others warm their homes using geothermal energy and the heat given off by fresh cow 's milk .
Jesper Kjems , of the Samso Energy Academy , told CNN , " 100 percent of our electricity comes from onshore turbines .
About 75 percent of our heating comes from heating plants and private people who have changed their oil furnaces to something renewable .
" Then we have the offshore turbines , which compensate for what we use in fossil fuels , heating and transport .
All in all we send more energy to the mainland than we use . "
Two of Samso's turbines are owned by a co-operative of around 450 of the island 's residents .
" [ They ] are the most important ones because they are the turbines that give the normal guy on the island the opportunity of investing in turbines , " said Kjems .
While the residents of Samso can take advantage of their island 's blustery weather , open spaces and low - population density to be carbon neutral , the success of wind energy on a global scale may come down to simple economics .
Danish company Vestas is the world 's biggest supplier of wind turbines .
Its president for Northern Europe , Klaus Mortensen , told CNN , " We are very focused on providing the lowest cost of energy .
With the present system we are competitive with oil at $ 50 a barrel . "
There is an expectation that prices will come down as turbines become cheaper and bigger companies throw their buying power into developing wind farms .
Eldrup told CNN , " Our initiatives , small company that we are , whatever we do wo n't change the world .
" But if we can be a good example so that some of the big guys will do some of the same things then the implications can be much bigger .
That would be wonderful . "
What do you think ?
Should we all try to live like the Samso islanders ?

WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court seemed likely to rule for the first time that gun possession is fundamental to American freedom , a move that would give federal judges power to strike down state and local weapons laws for infringing on Second Amendment rights .
At oral arguments Tuesday , the court considered whether its 2008 decision voiding the District of Columbia handgun ban should be extended to the rest of the country .
Because Washington is federal territory and not part of a state , the legal basis for imposing federal constitutional limits on gun laws adopted by states had been unclear .
None of the justices from the 2008 majority suggested any reason state handgun bans should be treated any differently .
If that 's how they rule , legal challenges likely would be mounted against gun regulations across the country .
On its face , the legal question before the court has little relation to policy views regarding gun control and much to do with questions of constitutional history .
The Supreme Court has subsequently held that many constitutional rights considered fundamental to American principles of liberty override state laws .
However , more technical provisions — such as the Fifth Amendment requirement that grand juries approve criminal indictments — apply only to the federal government and do n't necessarily bind states .

BBC Sport in Bahrain
Michael Schumacher said he must " raise his game " after Mercedes team - mate Nico Rosberg beat him in Friday practice at the season 's opening grand prix .
The German legend , returning to F1 after three years in retirement , was nearly 0.5 seconds slower than Rosberg in both practice sessions in Bahrain .
" That is a bit too much for my standards .
I 've got to raise my game a bit and I 'm sure I 'm able to , " he said .
Rosberg was fastest of all , 0.445secs quicker than McLaren 's Lewis Hamilton .
Schumacher , who was 0.494secs behind Rosberg , had been 0.463secs slower than his team - mate in the first session in the morning .
Afterwards , the 41 - year - old seven - time world champion said : " I certainly feel a little bit rusty , certainly on the one - lap issue I can do better .
" On long runs and consistent runs things are pretty good , I 'm quite happy .
I will just use the rest of the weekend in order to tweak out the little bits .
" It 's not a problem .
It 's just that for one lap I saw that Nico was four - tenths up and that is a bit too much for my standards .
I 've got to raise my game a bit and I 'm sure I 'm able to . "
Hamilton 's team - mate Jenson Button was fourth ahead of Red Bull 's Sebastian Vettel .
Button , who appeared to be very evenly matched with Hamilton , said : " I 'm reasonably happy with the car .
" It 's very difficult because the rear tyres go off quite quickly here , but it 's the same for everyone .
" The basic car is quite good .
The long runs seem to be reasonably good .
There are areas we need to work on with set - up . "
The Ferraris of Felipe Massa and Fernando Alonso were seventh and ninth in the afternoon after being fourth and second in the morning .
Force India 's Adrian Sutil stole the limelight in the morning session , beating Alonso to the fastest time in first practice , heading the double world champion by 0.325secs .
Alonso said he had no idea who was in the best shape for Saturday 's qualifying session and Sunday 's race .
" It 's still completely unknown , " he said .
" For sure , out of the four big teams , any can be on pole .
And there could be a surprise like Force India , who seem very quick on this type of circuit .
" We are in a position to attack 100 % .
We are confident with the car - we need to make changes to improve the grip but there is nothing wrong . "
606 : DEBATE
I am disappointed with the showing in practice of both Schumacher and Lotus ; Scumacher was much slower than his team - mate and Lotus were well off the pace
Jack
The gap between the fastest and slowest times was even bigger than expected , with Rosberg more than six seconds faster than the quickest car from a new team .
That car belonged to Virgin 's Timo Glock , who was 0.15secs quicker than his team - mate , the Brazilian novice Lucas di Grassi .
Heikki Kovalainen , the quicker of the two Lotus drivers , was two seconds slower than Glock - a margin that is almost certainly not representative of the true performance of the cars .
The Hispania team , who arrived in Bahrain having never run their car before , managed to put some mileage on it in the hands of Bruno Senna , the nephew of Brazilian legend Ayrton Senna .
But Senna was more than 12 seconds off the pace in what is effectively a shakedown test for the car .
Hispania missed all the pre-season test sessions as they battled to get themselves ready in time for the first race , following a change of name and ownership .
Senna also suffered a scare when something broke on his car at the end of one of the straights in the closing stages of the afternoon session .
His team - mate , the Indian driver Karun Chandhok , did not get out on to the track at all on Friday because the team could not make his gearbox work .
SARAH HOLT ON TWITTER Schumacher says he is a bit rusty and needs to shake it off
It remains to be seen whether Friday 's times are a reliable indicator of form , as practice sessions are even harder to read than usual following the banning of in - race refuelling this season .
Cars will now go to the grid fully laden with approximately 160kg - about 210 litres of fuel - and teams have to use the practice sessions to learn about the behaviour of their cars and tyres on both heavy and light fuel loads .
Cars will qualify with as little fuel as possible before filling up for the start of the race , and finding the best compromise between set -ups for the two conditions will be one of the major challenges of the season .
As fuel loads , tyre choice and track conditions can have a dramatic effect on lap times , it makes the list of fastest times in practice virtually meaningless without further analysis .

Past episodes are available on YouTube .
The ship was carrying about 100 personnel About 40 sailors are missing after a South Korean navy ship sank near the border with North Korea , Yonhap news agency said citing military officials .
The patrol vessel , with 104 people aboard , sank after an unexplained explosion tore through its hull .
Several sailors also died , officials are quoted saying as divers prepared to return to the scene after daybreak .
South Korean officials played down earlier reports that it may have been the result of an attack by North Korea .
There was no sign of the North 's military in the area where the ship sank , Yonhap said citing officials .
The military earlier said 58 sailors were rescued from near Baengnyeong island by several navy and coastguard vessels .
South Korean President Lee Myung - bak , who had convened an emergency meeting of security officials , had ordered the military to focus on rescuing the sailors , Yonhap news agency reported .
The police force was put on heightened alert in the capital , Seoul .
The Cheonan , a 1,200 - tonne corvette , began sinking about 2130 local time ( 1230 GMT ) on Friday , after an explosion , the South Korean Navy said .
A South Korean presidential spokeswoman said it was premature to say what caused the Cheonan to sink .
Strained ties
There were reports that another South Korean ship had fired shots toward an unidentified ship in the North following the alleged torpedo attack .
One report , quoting the joint chiefs of staff , said the target turned out to be a flock of birds .

At least 17 North Korean sailors believed killed in naval fire fight 1998 : South Korea captures a North Korean mini-submarine in its waters 1996 : A North Korean submarine runs aground in South Korean waters
The apparent clash comes at a time of tension between the two Koreas .
International talks aimed at ending the communist nation 's nuclear ambitions have been stalled for months .
Economic ties between the neighbours have also faltered , with continuing rows over both cross - border tourism and a joint economic zone at Kaesong .
The disputed sea boundary itself has seen numerous incidents , most recently in January and February .
In January , North Korea fired artillery into the sea near the disputed maritime border , as part of a " military drill " .
South Korea returned fire , but no injuries were reported .
The following month , North Korea declared four areas near the sea border to be naval firing zones , according to the South Korean military , and deployed multiple rocket launchers close to the frontier .
Deadly naval clashes happened in 1999 and in 2002 and the latest in November 2009 when a fire - fight left a North Korean patrol boat in flames and one person dead .
The South Korean vessel alleged that the North Korean vessel had crossed the disputed sea border - a charge North Korea denied .
South Korea recognises the Northern Limit Line , drawn unilaterally by the US - led United Nations Command to demarcate the sea border at the end of the 1950 - 53 Korean War .
The line has never been accepted by North Korea .

Geithner disputes this , of course .
“ We may sometimes look like it , ” he told me , “ but the United States is not an emerging market . ”
The disagreement over reform comes down to a difference of opinion about whether the United States ’ economic and financial predicament really is as bad as that of an emerging market , or whether it ’s bad , but not so bad that the banks need to be broken up .
Geithner convinced Obama — and Volcker has not yet convinced him otherwise — that modesty is the best policy .
What ca n’t be disputed is that the decision to focus on risk management rather than size carries the same political disadvantages Geithner ’s plan for recovery did .
By allowing Wall Street ’s major institutions to continue unmolested — even as they exploit the government ’s guarantee by paying themselves huge bonuses — the administration appears weak and indulgent , and deaf to the public ’s desire for retribution .
When Obama introduced the Volcker rules and started talking about wanting to pick a fight with Wall Street , he was at last succumbing to this pressure .
The depressing coda to all this is likely to be financial reform that falls short of even Geithner ’s plan .
Partly this is because the administration did n’t challenge many of the constraints that were already in place .
But mostly it is because even the biggest crisis since the Great Depression has n’t changed Washington ’s ideological outlook nearly so much as it has everybody else ’s .
Three decades ’ faith in deregulation and the power of the market makes a lasting impression .
Most members of Congress have enough political sense to criticize Wall Street bankers .
But meaning it enough to push tougher reforms is still regarded as slightly unsophisticated , as the handful of congressmen who ’ve tried can attest .
Before passing the administration ’s plan , the House weakened oversight , carved loopholes for derivatives trading , and cut commonsense measures like one requiring financial firms to offer “ plain vanilla ” alternatives to complicated ( and profitable ) products like mortgages .
The Senate seems poised to weaken things further .
All of this happened as a wave of anger was gathering force .
When it broke , with the Republican victory in Massachusetts , it seemed to finally sweep away some long - held illusions , causing many Democrats to realize how sharply at odds their beliefs are with popular sentiment .
Only now , too late , are those beliefs beginning to ebb .
The economic recovery has eased the urgency for reform that existed a year ago .
Even if the administration changed course and pushed for strenuous measures , Obama and Geithner probably lack the credibility to pull them off .
What successes they ’ve achieved are obscured by high unemployment and anger at Wall Street , reflecting the inadequacy of their stimulus and the fallout from their recovery and reform plans .
“ We managed the economic recovery like we were investment bankers , ” a senior adviser to Vice President Biden complains .
What chance there may have been for tough reforms came early in the crisis , when public anger was peaking and banks were weak , and any such reforms probably would have required someone other than Geithner , the face of the bailouts , as their champion .
Geithner does n’t breed nuance of opinion .
You ’re either for him or against him , and popular sentiment leans strongly toward the latter .
But it ’s possible to view him as someone who was indispensable in halting the crisis ( his understanding of Wall Street ’s psychology was particularly valuable ) while still doubting whether someone so steeped in the institutional cultures of Washington and Wall Street has the necessary distance to direct their reform .
The angry uprising that stopped the Obama agenda in its tracks is part of the steep political cost of following the Geithner Plan — a cost that seems to keep rising , even as the fiscal cost continues to fall .
Even the most prominent indicator of recovery , the robust stock market , has come to seem a curse , by reinforcing in the public mind how quickly Wall Street has recovered while everyone else is left to endure .
And Obama can’t really tout all that he ’s done without also drawing attention to his gentle treatment of Wall Street .
Depending on your point of view , this is either a cruel or a fitting irony .
By placing his chips on Geithner a year ago , Obama was betting that a strategy of growth under any circumstances was the right move , and that devising new rules was best left to insiders .
But even Geithner is n’t sure that the public will come to see it that way : “ In the end , what people care about is , what did you do ?
Did it make things better or not ?
That ’s what you ’ll be judged by .
Now , will it vindicate the president over time ?
It should , but I ’m not sure it will .
I think probably not .
The country is dramatically better off today .
People say the financial strategy was politically costly for us .
And I say to them , relative to what ?
Would it have been better to have the stock market where it was in March , the economy still falling , and unemployment much higher ? ”
History may yet judge Obama favorably .
But it 's entirely conceivable that the economy could outperform everyone 's expectations of a year ago and voters will still punish him and his party .
And , in fact , it appears ever more likely that that 's exactly what 's going to happen .
We want to hear what you think about this article .

American Police Training and Political Violence : From the Philippines Conquest to the Killing Fields of Afghanistan and Iraq
Jeremy Kuzmarov
“ In the police you see the dirty work of Empire at close quarters .
The wretched prisoners huddling in stinking cages of the lock - ups , the grey cowed faces of the long - term convicts , the scarred buttocks of the men who had been flogged with bamboos . ” - George Orwell , Shooting An Elephant and Other Essays .
“ The police interrogation rooms smelled of urine and injustice . ” – Graham Greene , The Quiet American .
As the U.S. expands the war in Afghanistan and Pakistan , the Obama administration has placed a premium on police training programs .
The stated aim is to provide security to the population so as to enable local forces to gradually take over from the military in completing the pacification process .
A similar strategy has been pursued by the United States in Iraq .
In both , American - backed forces have been implicated in sectarian violence , death squad activity and torture .
At the same time , the weaponry and equipment that the U.S. provided has frequently found its way into the hands of insurgents , many of whom have infiltrated the state security apparatus , contributing to the long - drawn out nature of both conflicts .
Ignored in mainstream media commentary and “ think tank ” analyses is the fact that the destructive consequences of American strategy in the Middle - East and Central Asia today are consistent with practices honed over more than a century in the poor nations of the periphery .
Police training has been central to American attempts to expand its reach from the conquest of the Philippines at the dawn of the 20th century through the Cold War era to today .
Presented to the public in both the target country and the United States as humanitarian initiatives designed to strengthen democratic development and public security , these programs achieved neither , but were critical to securing the power base of local elites amenable to U.S. economic and political interests and contributed to massive human rights violations .
They helped to facilitate the rise of powerful anti-democratic forces , which operated above the law , contributing to endemic violence , state terrorism and corruption .
1
Quite consistently across time and space , American policy - makers have supported police suppression of radical and nationalist movements as a cost - effective and covert means precluding costly military intervention which was more likely to arouse public opposition .
During the mid 1960s , the Director of United States Agency of International Development ( USAID ) David Bell commented in congressional testimony that “ the police are a most sensitive point of contact between the government and people , close to the focal points of unrest , and more acceptable than the army as keepers of order over long periods of time .
The police are frequently better trained and equipped than the military to deal with minor forms of violence , conspiracy and subversion . ” 2 Robert W. Komer who served as a National Security Council advisor to President John F. Kennedy further stressed that the police were “ more valuable than Special Forces in our global counter - insurgency efforts ” and particularly useful in fighting urban insurrections .
“ We get more from the police in terms of preventative medicine than from any single U.S. program , ” he said .
“ They are cost effective , while not going for fancy military hardware .
They provide the first line of defense against demonstrations , riots and local insurrections .
Only when the situation gets out of hand ( as in South Vietnam ) does the military have to be called in . ” 3
These remarks illuminate the underlying geo-strategic imperatives shaping the growth of the programs and the mobilization of police for political and military ends , which accounted for widespread human rights abuses .
This article , drawing on declassified U.S. government archives , examines some of the landmark instances in the historical development of American police training programs to highlight the origins of current policies in the killing fields of Afghanistan and Iraq .
Over years , as U.S. imperial attention has shifted from one region to another , police training and financing has remained an unobserved constant , evolving with new strategies and weapons innovations but always retaining the same strategic goals and tactical elements .
Staffed by military and police officers who valued order and discipline over the protection of civil liberties , the programs were designed to empower pro-U.S. regimes committed to free - market capitalist development and helped to create elaborate intelligence networks , which facilitated the suppression of dissident groups in a more surgical way .
The United States in effect helped to modernize intelligence gathering and political policing operations in its far - flung empire , thus magnifying their impact .
They further helped to militarize the police and fostered , through rigorous ideological conditioning , the dehumanization of political adversaries .
4
The result was a reign of torture and terror as part of police practice in countries subject to U.S. influence , the devolution of police forces into brutal oppressors of the indigenous population , and the growth of corruption levels pushing regimes towards kleptocracy .
In his trilogy on the American empire , Chalmers Johnson demonstrates how the United States has historically projected its global power through a variety of means , including economic blackmail and the manipulation of financial institutions , covert operations , arms sales , and most importantly , through the development of a global network of military bases whose scale dwarfs all previous empires , including Rome .
5
This article seeks to add another important structural dimension of U.S. power , namely the training of police and paramilitary units under the guise of humanitarian assistance , which preceded and continued through the era of global military bases .
“ Breaking Up Bands of Political Plotters : ” Colonial Policing and State Terror in the Philippines
In 1898 , seeking access to the vast “ China market ” and building the foundation of its seizure of Hawaii , the United States entered the great “ imperial game ” through its colonization of the Philippines .
From 1899 - 1902 , the U.S. military waged a relentless campaign to suppress the nationalist movement for independence , resulting in the death of perhaps two million Filipinos and the destruction of the societal fabric .
As the fighting waned , the Philippines Commission under future president William H. Taft focused on building an indigenous police force , officered by Americans , which was capable of finishing off the insurgents and establishing order .
The constabulary engaged in patrols for over a decade to suppress nationalist and messianic peasant revolts in the countryside .
It frequently employed scorched earth tactics and presided over numerous massacres , including killing hundreds of civilians at Bud Dajo in the Moro province of Mindanao , where Muslims refused to acquiesce to American power and rule .
Philippines Constabulary
As Alfred W. McCoy documents in his outstanding new book , Policing America ’s Empire : The United States , the Philippines and the Rise of the Surveillance State , the constabulary ’s success in serving US imperial interests owed largely to the role of military intelligence officers in imparting pioneering methods of data management and covert techniques of surveillance , which were appropriated by domestic policing agencies , including the Federal Bureau of Investigations ( FBI ) , during the 1st Red Scare .
Under the command of Harry H. Bandholtz , the constabulary ’s secret service became especially effective in adopting psychological warfare techniques , such as the wearing of disguises , fabricating disinformation and recruiting paid informants and saboteurs in their efforts to “ break up bands of political plotters . ”
They monitored the press , carried out periodic assassinations and compiled dossiers on thousands of individuals as well as information on the corruption of America ’s Filipino proxies as means to keep them tied to the occupation .
One of the major technical achievements was an alarm system , which ended dependence on the public telephone .
American advisors further imparted new administrative and fingerprinting techniques , which allowed for an expansion of the police ’s social control capabilities .
The declaration of martial law ensured minimal governmental oversight and facilitated surveillance and arrests without due process .
Torture , including the notorious water cure , was widely employed .
6
After the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus in Cavite and Batangas due to heavy guerrilla activity , William Cameron Forbes , a grandson of philosopher Ralph Waldo Emerson who served as Commissioner of Commerce and Police from 1904 to 1908 and Governor General from 1909 - 1913 , noted in his journal that “ the constabulary was now free to run in the suspects .
A lot of innocent people will be put in jail for a while , but it will also mean that some guilty ones will be caught and the cancer will be cut . ”
7
These comments exemplify the ends justifies the means philosophy underpinning the abuse of human rights , which was characteristic of later interventions as well .
Racism was another prominent factor .
Henry T. Allen , the first chief of the constabulary , characteristically referred to Filipinos resisting the United States as suffering from “ intense ignorance ” and the “ fanatical ” characteristics of “ semi- savagery . ”
He added , in a letter to Taft , that “ education and roads will effect what is desired , but while awaiting these , drastic measures are obligatory …
The only remedy is killing and for the same reason that a rabid dog must be disposed of . ”
8
In his memoir , Bullets and Bolos , constabulary officer John R. White , who went on to serve with the U.S. military in World War I , recounts how his men razed houses , “ plundered all that they could carry away ” and destroyed sugar and other foodstuffs in the attempt to isolate and starve the Moro enemy in Mindanao .
In the end , they left the pretty plateau a “ burned and scarred sore . ”
This was hard , ” he wrote , “ but necessary for we did not want the job of taking Mindanao again . ” 9
The tactics pioneered in the Philippines paved the way for later American action under the Strategic Hamlet program in South Vietnam .
The constabulary ultimately succeeded in infiltrating and sowing dissension within radical organizations , including an incipient labor movement , contributing to their implosion .
It even played a role in apostolic succession by undermining the influence of Bishop Gregorio Aglipay through the spread of disinformation .
He was a nationalist with socialist sympathies whose services were attended by thousands of the urban poor .
The legacy of political repression and corruption survived long after the Philippines was granted independence in the mid 1930s .
The constabulary and police have maintained their notoriety for brutality , right up to the present , as new waves of repression and violence are being launched under the guise of the “ War on Terror . ”
“ Popping Off Cacos : ” The U.S. Gendarmerie and Racial Slaughter in Haiti
American policies in the Philippines were replicated in the Caribbean during the colonial occupations of the 1910s and 1920s , where they contributed to the spread of considerable violence and repression .
In Haiti , the Gendarmerie was the brainchild of Franklin D. Roosevelt , who , influenced by his cousin , Teddy , viewed the creation of a local police force as a cost - effective means of advancing U.S. reach .
The Gendarmerie was mobilized primarily to fight against nationalist rebels , known as the Cacos , and to oversee brutal forced labor regiments imposed by the United States .11
As in the Philippines , the United States provided modern police technologies , including communications equipment and fingerprinting techniques , and worked to improve administration and records collection to aid in the monitoring of dissident activity .
In a prelude to the Cold War , riot control training was also provided to facilitate the crack down on urban demonstrations and strikes .
American officers taunted people using racial epithets and did not usually object when rioters were badly beaten and clubbed , sometimes to death .12
Journalist Samuel G. Inman observed that the Gendarmerie enjoyed practically “ unlimited power ” in the districts where they served , creating opportunities for extortion and kickbacks .
“ He is the judge of practically all civil and criminal cases , the paymaster for all funds from the central government and ex-officio director of the schools inasmuch as he pays the teachers .
He controls the mayor and city council since they cannot spend funds without his ok .
As collector of taxes , he exercises a strong influence on all individuals in the community .
” 13 These comments exemplify the consequences of U.S. policy in giving too much power to police units , resulting in systematic abuse .
Charlemagne Peralte , “ Black Christ , ” strung up to intimidate others after assassination .
The Gendarmerie was especially valued for obtaining intelligence and adopted , as a precursor to the CIA , psychological warfare tactics , including the spread of disinformation , the playing on native superstitions , and use of disguises to induce defections and infiltrate enemy camps .
One of the Gendarmerie ’s chief psy- war experts , Captain Herman H. Hanneken blackened his skin , disguised himself as a Caco and bribed a bodyguard to gain access to the camp of leader Charlemagne Peralte , who became known as the “ black Christ ” after images of his decapitated body strung up on a cross were disseminated for intimidation purposes .
Political terrorism would remain a feature of American counter - insurgency strategy through the Vietnam War-era and continuing today in Afghanistan and Iraq .
The violence that was endemic to the American occupation of Haiti was in large part racial .
On search and destroy missions , “ popping off ” Cacos was likened to a sport , much like with the “ pulajanes , ” “ ladrones ” and “ gu- gus ” in the Philippines , and later the “ gooks ” in Vietnam .
Colonel Robert Denig noted in his diary that “ life to Haitians is cheap , murder is nothing . ”
Lieutenant Faustin Wirkus added that killing Haitian rebels was like playing “ hit the nigger and get a cigar games ” at amusement parks back home .
14 After the Caco movement was destroyed and the Marines were withdrawn , the United States continued to arm and train the Gendarmerie which it recognized as a pivotal instrument of power .
Following a period of military rule in the 1940s , François “ Papa Doc ” Duvalier used the police to suppress political dissent , orchestrating what internal reports referred to as “ an active campaign of harassment and terrorism all over the country . ”
This fit in with a broader regional pattern , as the U.S. - created National Guard evolved into the political instrument of dictators Anastasio Somoza in Nicaragua and Rafael Trujillo in the Dominican Republic , both having emerged from police ranks .
15
The police programs thus contributed not only to the spread of political violence in suppressing anti-occupational resistance , but also paved the way for an era of strong - armed rule and state terrorism after American colonial occupations formally ended .
“ Arresting Anyone Under the Remotest Suspicion of Being Left - Wing . ” Police Training and Political Terror in South Vietnam
Building off the techniques pioneered in previous interventions , police training programs were an integral part of American counter - insurgency strategy in Vietnam , where they aided in the creation of an Orwellian - style police state and helped to stoke civil conflict .
Training began in 1955 as a centerpiece of America ’s “ nation - building ” campaign on behalf of President Ngo Dinh Diem , who replaced French puppet emperor Bao Dai following the temporary division of the country under the 1954 Geneva Accords .
Valued by the US for his anticommunism , Diem had little interest in developing a Western style democracy and wanted to establish his own political dynasty .
16 The principal US motive was to contain the spread of the Chinese revolutionary movement , which threatened the Open Door policy .
17 The Eisenhower administration refused to allow mandated elections to unify the country , which it knew would be won by the revolutionary leader Ho Chi Minh , whom the State Department referred to as the “ ablest ” and “ most charismatic leader ” in the country .
18
The police operation was run by Michigan State University ( MSU ) faculty under contract with the State Department .
Much like in the Philippines and Haiti decades earlier , the United States stressed mass surveillance capable of monitoring subversion and dismantling the political opposition to Diem .
New technologies hastened the scale of violence associated with these efforts , though proved limited in engendering a favorable outcome for the United States .
American advisors urged police to develop a more efficient record gathering system and modeled the Surêté after the American FBI , arming it with 12 - gauge shotguns , sedans , ammunition , and riot - control equipment to counter subversion .
There were few pretenses from the beginning that the police were anything but a political instrument , with many top officials , including Surêté Director Nguyen Ngoc Le , having been previously trained by France .19
The MSU team developed an identity card system to monitor political activity as part of Diem ’s anticommunist denunciation campaign .
Those found with links to the Vietminh , who had led the liberation struggle against France , were arrested and faced torture at an assortment of prison camps , or were “ disappeared , ” as internal reports noted .
20 Even Diem ’s own chief of staff , Tran Van Don , derided the use of “ Gestapo - like police raids and torture ” against “ those who simply opposed the government . ”
U.S. support was crucial in shaping South Vietnam ’s evolution into what Foreign Affairs described as a “ quasi - police state marred by arbitrary arrests , censorship of the press and the absence of political opposition . ” 21 The passage of law 10 /59 allowing for the execution of regime opponents resulted in the declaration of armed resistance by the National Liberation Front ( NLF ) , whose leader , Nguyen Huu Tho was rescued from house arrest through infiltration of Diem ’s police by revolutionary supporters .

Starting in 1961 , after taking over from Michigan State , the United States Agency for International Development ’s Office of Public Safety ( OPS ) sent advisers to Malaya for counter - guerrilla training .
Over the next fourteen years , working with the Public Safety Division of the U.S. Operations Mission to Vietnam ( USOM ) , the OPS provided more than 300 advisers and $ 300 million towards this goal , bolstering the number of police from 16,000 to 122,000 .
They funded eight specialized training schools and built over 500 rural police stations and high - tech urban headquarters equipped with firearm ranges , computer systems and padded interrogation rooms .
23
The OPS also helped to create a telecommunications network linking police headquarters in rural villages to major cities such as Saigon .
As in the Philippines and Haiti , emphasis was placed on building a corps of informants and developing a climate of fear to intimidate those who might challenge the government .
24
To this latter end , psychological warfare teams painted a ghostly eye on the doors of houses suspected of harboring “ Vietcong ” agents .
Penetration by the NLF , however , and a lack of conviction on the part of American trained forces helped to stymie these efforts , to the frustration of many American advisors who could not get around the strength of Vietnamese nationalism and political dynamic underlying the civil war .
25 Language and cultural barriers and an underlying paternalism further strained social relations and made communications difficult , limiting effectiveness .
In May 1963 , as opposition to Diem ’s rule intensified , police killed nine monks , as well as three women and two children at a rally against religious persecution and government violence .
In July , according to OPS adviser Ray Lundgren , in spite of the “ amazing results ” yielded by riot control courses , police again displayed “ unnecessary brutality ” in suppressing a peaceful Buddhist rally against repeated injustices , beating monks and other civilians .
In November , Diem was overthrown in a coup d’état and replaced by a revolving door of Generals , including ultimately Nguyen Cao Ky and Nguyen Van Thieu , who had served under the French and were implicated in the narcotics trade .
26 The U.S. in turn invaded and launched massive bombing campaigns which decimated the South Vietnamese countryside .
Identity cards issued in South Vietnam
In an attempt to maximize social control in the face of mounting popular resistance , the OPS expanded the surveillance program first initiated by Michigan State , issuing identity cards to everyone over fifteen and compiling dossiers on the political beliefs of nearly 12 million people .
27
Once dissidents were identified , the police undertook night sweeps in their villages and “ arrested anyone under the remotest suspicion of being left - wing , ” as one witness put it .
“ The government has a blacklist of suspects , but I understand that wives , mothers and fathers — anyone with the slimmest association with those on it are being caught in the net .
” 28 Many of those taken in were peace activists , students , members of oppositional groups like the Hoa - Hao and Cao Dai sects , and politicians who were seen as threats to the reigning junta .
Echoing his predecessors in previous interventions , CIA Station Chief Douglas Blaufarb rationalized the repression on the grounds that “ it was futile to have expected in the circumstances a punctilious regard in all cases for the niceties of civil rights .
” 29 Racism and the perceived inferiority of the Vietnamese “ gooks ” lay behind wide - scale human rights violations .
Some of the worst abuses took place within the prison system overseen by the OPS .
Conditions were described as “ nightmarish , ” “ appalling ” and equivalent to “ hell on earth , ” stemming largely from the rampant overcrowding caused by the influx of political prisoners .
Inmates were packed into tiny cells , where they had to sleep standing up or in shifts , and deprived of proper food , bathing facilities and medical attention .
At Kien Tung Provincial Prison , just ten kilometers from the seat of government , William C. Benson of the OPS reported that the cells were “ extremely dirty and the stench so nauseating ” that it made him sick .
30 In An Xuyen , OPS advisor Donald Bordenkircher , who three decades later was appointed to head the Abu Ghraib prison facility in Iraq , wrote to his superiors that inmates had to sleep next to their own urine and feces and that the kitchen doubled as a trash dump and was inhabited by giant rats which were “ as large as cats . ”
31
Known as a stern disciplinarian , Bordenkircher embodies the continuity in American policies from Vietnam to Iraq , Afghanistan and the United States itself , where as town sheriff in Moundsville Virginia in 1986 , he played a key role in crushing an inmate rebellion arising from wretched prison conditions .
32 Torture including sensory deprivation , rape , lashings and the use of electroshocks was widely documented in facilities under U.S. oversight in Vietnam .
Frank Walton , head of the OPS in Vietnam and a former Los Angeles Police Department ( LAPD ) chief , sanctioned a report stating that non-cooperative prisoners , whom he referred to as “ reds who keep preaching the commie line , ” were “ isolated in their cells for months ” and permanently “ bolted to the floor or handcuffed to leg - irons , ” which was standard practice shaped by the war climate .33
Not surprisingly , the prisons provided an important base of recruitment for the revolutionary forces , contributing to their ultimate victory in 1975 .
After a tour of penal facilities in the Mekong Delta , senior American adviser John Paul Vann commented , “ I got the distinct impression that any detainees not previously VC or VC sympathizers would almost assuredly become so after their period of incarceration . ”
34
Police programs in Vietnam culminated in the notorious Operation Phoenix , whose aim was to eliminate the “ Vietcong ” infrastructure ( VCI ) through use of sophisticated computer technology and intelligence gathering techniques , and improved coordination between military and civilian police intelligence agencies .
In practice , Phoenix spiraled out of control and led to indiscriminate violence .
Internal reports pointed out the widespread corruption of American - trained cadres who used their positions for revenge and extortion , threatening to kill people who refused to pay them huge sums .
“ VC avenger units , ” regularly mutilated bodies and killed family members of suspected guerrillas .35
While the quantity of “ neutralizations ” was reported to be very high in many districts , there were “ flagrant ” cases of report padding , most egregiously in the province of Long An where Phoenix advisor Evan Parker Jr. noted that “ the numbers just do n’t add up . ”
Dead bodies were being identified as VCI , rightly or wrongly , in order to fulfill quotas .
36
The catalogue of agents listed as killed included an inordinate number of “ nurses , ” which was a convenient way to account for women killed in raids on suspected VC hideouts .
37 A Phoenix operative who had served in Czechoslovakia during World War II tellingly commented , “ The reports that I would send in on the number of communists that were neutralized reminded me of the reports Hitler ’s concentration camp commanders sent in on how many inmates they had exterminated , each commander lying that he had killed more than the other to please Himmler . ” 38 These comments epitomize how the police training programs helped to facilitate state repression and terror under the rubric of internal security and modernization .
The attempt at social control through imposition of an Orwellian regime of mass surveillance and torture lay at the root of the wide - scale humanitarian abuses , which fit with a much larger historical pattern .
“ It ’s the Police We Worry About : ” The Violence Comes Full Circle in Af - Pak and Iraq
The violent history of U.S. imperial intervention is being played out today in Afghanistan and Iraq , where police training programs are central to American - backed political repression and terror .
Management of the programs has been especially poor given cultural and language barriers , deeply entrenched hostility towards foreign intervention among the population , and administrative incompetence .
In addition , the problems have been exacerbated by the increasing reliance on private mercenary corporations such as DynCorp and Blackwater ( renamed Xe ) , and on tainted police advisors linked to human rights violations and malfeasance .
In Afghanistan , after almost nine years and seven billion dollars spent on training and salaries , an internal report concluded that “ nepotism , financial improprieties and unethical recruitment practices were commonplace ” among the American - backed forces , which engaged in widespread criminal activity and bribery and were “ overmatched in counter - insurgency and counter - narcotics operations . ”
American police advisors , whose background as small town cops did little to prepare them for policing in a war zone , made six figure salaries , 50 times more than their Afghan counterparts , who resented their presence .
According to a recent poll , less than 20 percent of the population in the eastern and southern provinces trusted the police , who are poorly motivated and whose poor performance has contributed to political instability and the resurgence of the Taliban .
A taxi driver interviewed by RAND Corporation analyst Seth G. Jones tellingly commented , “ Forget about the Taliban , it is the police we worry about . ”
39
Despised and feared , the Afghan national police have been continuously controlled by ethnic warlords paid off by the CIA and are central to what Ambassador Ron Neumann characterized as the pattern of “ repression and oppression ” gripping the country .
They have routinely engaged in shakedowns at impromptu checkpoints , shot at and killed stone - throwing or unarmed demonstrators , stolen farmers ’ land , and terrorized the civilian population while undertaking house - to - house raids in military - assisted sweep operations .
They have further intimidated voters during fraudulent elections , including the one that brought Hamid Karzai back to power in 2009 .
According to village elders in Babaji , police bent on taking revenge against clan rivals carried out the abduction and rape of pre-teen girls and boys .
40
These kinds of abuses fit with a larger historical pattern , and are a product of the ethnic antagonisms and social polarizations bred by the United States intervention , and the mobilization of police for military and political ends .
Afghan Police in 2006 photo
The open support by the Bush administration for torture and other harsh methods strengthened the proclivity towards indiscriminate violence .
The International Red Cross reported massive overcrowding in Afghan prisons , “ harsh ” conditions , a lack of clarity about the legal basis for detention , and people being held “ incommunicado ” in isolation cells where they were “ subjected to cruel treatment in violation of the Geneva Conventions . ”
An undisclosed number have died in custody , including several thousand who were transported under the oversight of CIA - backed warlord Rashid Dostum in unventilated containers , where they suffocated to death or were shot .
41
Corruption has been a major problem as police routinely accept kickbacks from black - market activities .
Fitting a historical pattern , the State Department and CIA have maintained close ties with top officials who are directly involved in the narcotics trade , causing production to rise to over 8,000 tons per annum .
The president ’s own brother , Ahmed Wali , a CIA “ asset ” who heads a paramilitary group used for raids on suspected Taliban enclaves has used drug proceeds to fund state terror operations , including the intimidation of opponents in the rigged election of 2009 .
Karzai ’s 2007 appointment as anticorruption chief , Izzatullah Wasifi , meanwhile , spent almost four years in a Nevada prison for trying to sell heroin to an undercover police officer .
A CIA officer commented that during the U.S. - NATO occupation , “ Virtually every significant Afghan figure has had brushes with the drug trade .
If you are looking for Mother Theresa , she does n’t live in Afghanistan . ” 42
Cheryl Bernard , a RAND analyst and husband of Zalmay Khalilzad , UN Ambassador of the George W. Bush administration , explained one of the key reasons for the lack of good governance : “ To defeat the Soviets we threw the worst crazies against them .
Then we allowed them to get rid of , just kill all the moderate leaders .
The reason we do n’t have moderate leaders in Afghanistan today is because we let the nuts kill them all .
They killed all the leftists , the moderates , the middle of the roaders .
They were just eliminated , during the 1980s and afterwards .
” 43 The United States continues to tolerate high - levels of corruption out of perceived geo-political expediency , claiming that it is engrained within the political culture of Afghanistan and other “ backward nations ” in which it intervenes .
In reality , however , it is a product of historical contingencies , the breakdown of social mores caused by the war - climate and the need of elite officials lacking popular legitimacy to obtain money for counter - insurgency operations .
Similar factors were at play in the 1960s when Vietnam and Laos were at the center of the world drug trade , benefiting from American backing of corrupt officials who controlled the traffic , with the CIA overseeing the production and sale of opium by Hmong guerrillas in order to finance the secret war against the Pathet Lao.44
History is thus coming full circle in Afghanistan , which now produces 93 percent of the world ’s heroin and has been characterized by even Fox News , a major champion of American intervention , as a “ narco - state . ” 45 Drug money has corrupted all facets of society , crippled the legal economy and made it nearly impossible to carry out the simplest development projects while most of the population lives in crushing poverty .
As in South Vietnam under U.S. occupation , the main airport has become a major transshipment point for heroin and positions for police chief in many provinces are auctioned off to the highest bidder due to their enormous graft value .
Securing a job as chief of police on the border is rumored to cost upwards of $ 150,000.46
In another parallel to Vietnam , rampant human rights violations have driven many people into the arms of the insurgency .
A 2009 report by Commanding General Stanley A. McChrystal describes Afghan prisons as a particularly important recruiting base and “ sanctuary [ for Islamic militants ] to conduct lethal operations ” against government and coalition forces , including the 2008 bombing of the Serena hotel in Kabul which was allegedly planned without interference from prison personnel .
McChrystal , a former Special Forces assassin , notes that “ there are more insurgents per square foot in corrections facilities than anywhere else in Afghanistan . ” 47 These comments suggest that the recent Obama “ surge ” represents a costly and futile escalation of a conflict in which the U.S. has no prospects of victory .
Beginning in 2004 , as war increasingly spilled over into Pakistan , the State Department provided tens of millions of dollars in technical aid , training and equipment to the Pakistani police .
The central aim was to fight the Taliban and consolidate the power of military dictator Pervez Musharraf and his successor Ali Asaf Zhardari .
American advisors introduced a computerized security and evaluation system to monitor all movement across the border , created special counter - narcotics units and a police air wing which was supplied with three caravan spotter planes and eight Huey helicopters to aid in counter - insurgency operations .
Police play a vital role alongside mercenary firms such as Xe operations in identifying targets for CIA predator drone attacks which have killed hundreds of civilians , including over 100 during an errant strike on the village of Bola Baluk .48
As in Afghanistan , militarization has enhanced the already repressive character of the police and contributed to the intensification of a vicious civil war in which over two million people have been rendered refugees .
The Pakistani intelligence service ( ISI ) meanwhile is deeply caught up in the heroin traffic , with the usual CIA collusion , and has been infiltrated by pro-Taliban elements , revealing the futility of American training programs and intervention .
49
In Iraq , much as in Vietnam three decades earlier , American training programs have contributed to the shattering of the societal fabric .
The mission was initially headed by Bernard Kerik , former New York City police commissioner who won fame in leading rescue efforts at Ground Zero on September 11 and was later convicted and sentenced to four years in prison on charges of tax fraud and public corruption .

In spite of hundreds of millions in funding , the Iraqi National Police ( INP ) remains under - equipped and riddled with cronyism and corruption .
Police were so poorly motivated and paid that many sold their bullets and uniforms on the black market .
51 Historically , the forces trained by the United States to subdue their own countrymen have taken on the air of paid mercenaries with little loyalty to their benefactor or the cause that they purportedly represent .
Iraq is no exception to this general rule .
A State Department report noted that because of poor morale , Iraqi police have been rendered “ ineffective and have quit or abandoned their stations . ”
They were infiltrated by sectarian militias who used American weapons to engage in ethnic cleansing and brazenly drove through city streets in daylight hours with dead bodies in the backs of their trucks .
Militarized units routinely fired into crowds of unarmed demonstrators and had a history of going on forays into Sunni neighborhoods just to punish civilians .
Several dozen investigative journalists and 200 prominent academics who opposed the United States invasion were among those assassinated .
Jerry Burke , one of the original police trainers who served two tours in Iraq , told reporters in 2007 that the INP was unsalvageable and that many of its members should be prosecuted for criminal human rights violations , war crimes and death squad activities .
52
A central US focus was on training heavily armed commando units , recruited from Saddam Hussein ’s Special Forces after the reversal of the debathification policy , whose primary mission was to “ neutralize ” high level insurgents .
American strategy in this respect was modeled after the Phoenix program in Vietnam , of which Vice - President Dick Cheney was particularly enamored , and also bore heavy resemblances to practices in Central America during Ronald Reagan ’s terrorist wars of the 1980s .
In 2004 , Cheney openly called for the “ Salvador option , ” referring to the U.S. role in training paramilitary units to assassinate left - wing guerrilla leaders and their supporters during El Salvador ’s dirty war , largely with the aim of intimidating the population into submission .
53 James Steele ’s appointment as a top adviser to Iraq 's most fearsome counterinsurgency force , the 5,000 man Special Police Commandos , exemplified the continuity in US policy .
Steele served with the Green Berets in Vietnam , further honed his tactics training Contra forces in Nicaragua in the 1980s , then led a Special Forces mission in El Salvador where his men were implicated in serious human rights abuses , including “ disappearances , ” torture and the massacre of civilians .
54 Journalist Dahr Jamail wrote that it was no coincidence daily life in Iraq came to resemble “ what the death squads generated in Central America …..
Hundreds of unclaimed dead at the morgue – blood - caked men who had been shot , knifed , garroted or apparently suffocated by the plastic bag still over their heads .
Many of their bodies were sprawled with their hands still bound .
”
55
By training and arming Iraqi police officials notorious for corruption , beatings , kidnappings and mass executions , American advisors contributed to the bloodbath in Iraq .
The continuity in personnel and practice from past interventions shows the violent consequences of U.S. training programs .
American advisors favored hard - line commanders , like Adnan Thabit , whom close aides compared to the “ godfather ” and who threatened to kill the one journalist brave enough to interview him .
On October 5 , 2006 , U.S. military forces removed the entire 8th brigade of the 2nd National Police Division from duty and arrested its officers after the brigade was implicated in the raid of a food factory in Baghdad and the kidnapping of 26 Sunni workers , seven of whom were executed .
The Los Angeles Times reported that at the Baghdad morgue , “ dozens of bodies arrive at the same time on a weekly basis , including scores of corpses with wrists bound by police handcuffs .
” 56
In December 2006 , the Iraq study group portrayed a grave and deteriorating state of affairs , noting that “ the Shiite dominated police units cannot control crime and they routinely engage in sectarian violence , including the unnecessary detention , torture and targeted execution of Sunni Arab civilians .
Many police participated in training in order to obtain a weapon , uniform and ammunition for use in sectarian violence .
” 57 A human rights watch report around the same time detailed police methods of interrogation in which prisoners were “ routinely ” beaten with cables and pipes , shocked , or suspended from their wrists for prolonged periods of time - tactics associated with Hussein 's dictatorship .
Iraqis frequently complained of police breaking into homes , extorting money for ransom and arbitrarily conducting arrests .
One interviewee commented , “ This is n’t a police force , it ’s a bunch of thugs . ” 58 What all these reports ignore is the systematic US responsibility for the training and methods that produced such outcomes .
As a symbol of foreign oppression , the INP became the frequent target of insurgent attacks .
Nearly 3,000 police were killed and over 5,000 injured between September 2005 and April 2006 alone .
In a reflection of the violent climate bred by the occupation , a number of high - ranking police officers , including the head of the serious crimes unit in Baghdad , were shot dead by U.S. soldiers who thought that they were suicide bombers .
59 Iraqi police have condemned the Americans as cowardly for not taking the same risks to their lives as they were ordered to take , and for being better protected from attack .
A police lieutenant in Baghdad commented that “ the [ Americans ] hide behind the barricades while we are here in the streets without even guns to protect ourselves .
”
60
As in the Philippines , Haiti and Vietnam earlier , American advisors held racial stereotypes of Iraqis and a paternalistic and colonial mindset that bred resentment .
In a memoir of his year in Iraq , Robert Cole , a police officer from East Palo Alto , California and a DynCorp employee , explains that these attitudes were engrained in a mini- boot camp training session , where he was “ brainwashed , reprogrammed and desensitized ” and “ morphed ” into a “ trained professional killer . ”
Cole reports being told to shoot first and think later and to instruct police to do the same .
“ If you see a suspicious Iraqi civilian , pull your weapon and gun him down , ” he was told , “ you do n’t fire one or two shots …
You riddle his sorry ass with bullets until you ’re sure he ’s dead as a doorknob .
”
61
This is an inversion not only of democratic police methods but even of western counter - insurgency doctrine which , at least in theory , advocates a moderation of force in order to avoid antagonizing the population and creating martyrs for the revolutionary cause .
62
It is no wonder that the scope of violence and human rights abuses in Iraq has been so high .
In spite of all the bloodshed and negative reports , however , the Iraq Study group actually recommended expanding American police training in the misconceived belief that more resources and aid could help professionalize the force ( as Obama is now doing in Afghanistan ) .
This was a crucial dimension of the much vaunted “ surge . ” 63 Efforts were initiated to include Sunnis in the police and purge corrupt members who engaged in sectarian violence , including the head of the Ministry of the Interior , Bayan Jabr , a Shiite extremist who oversaw a torture chamber beneath his offices in which survivors were found with drill marks in their skulls .
64 Nonetheless , extrajudicial violence and killings have remained endemic .
On March 16 , 2009 , the New York Times reported , for example , that police officers abducted and killed six prisoners released from Camp Bucca in revenge for their days as insurgents .
These actions appear to be routine .
65
Since the “ surge , ” police have been delegated more responsibility in manning checkpoints and aiding in combat operations , thus increasing opportunities for extortion and abuse .
To what end ?
Robert M. Witajewski , a top civilian police trainer and director of the embassy ’s Law Enforcement and Correctional Affairs program expressed concern that in “ over - militarizing the police , ” the U.S. was potentially “ creating an entity that could cause a coup down the road . ” 66 There are plenty of historical examples which bear out these fears .
Few in Washington appear , however , to acknowledge them .
In response to the wave of neo -conservative analysts extolling the virtues of empire in the aftermath of 9/11 , Chalmers Johnson writes in Nemesis : The Last Days of the American Republic that the idea of “ forcing thousands of people to be free by slaughtering them – with Maxim machine guns in the 19th century , or ‘ precision munitions ’ today – seems to reflect a deeply felt need as well as a striking inability to imagine the lives and viewpoints of others . ”
He added that “ all empires require myths of divine right , racial preeminence , manifest destiny or a ‘ civilizing mission ’ to cover their often barbarous behavior in other people ’s country .
” 67 American imperial intervention throughout the long century from the conquest of the Philippines through the ongoing wars in Afghanistan and Iraq has indeed sown much human misery and violence .
While it has helped to vanquish some genuinely totalitarian forces , such as the Nazis and imperial Japanese , all too often those at the wrong end of the guns have been supporters of nationalist and social revolutionary movements seeking badly needed social change .
Many were driven underground through repression and as a result of the U.S. refusal to implement internationally sanctioned diplomatic settlements , such as the Geneva Accords of 1954 in Vietnam .
Like previous colonial powers , the U.S. has also often helped to exacerbate ethnic divisions and conflict , as in Afghanistan and Iraq today , with disastrous results .
United States police training programs exemplify the dark side of the American empire .
They have been crucial in advancing American power and in perpetuating and even creating the particular types of repressive regimes that emerged under U.S. guidance – namely regimes which were dependent on foreign aid for their survival and developed repressive surveillance and internal security apparatuses to quash dissent .
While American strategic planners hoped that the police programs could provide the social stability for liberal - capitalist development to take root , the programs often spiraled out of control and empowered rogue forces , which used the modern weaponry and resources to advance their own power and to suppress personal rivals .
American police training furthermore spawned endless cycles of violence and in turn contributed to the delegitimizing of American client regimes and the empowerment of resistance movements because of the abuses that they inflicted .
Police programs epitomize the limits of American social engineering efforts and power and unintended consequences of U.S. covert manipulation .
68
Many of the worst features of American police training programs have been evident in the contemporary occupations of Afghanistan and Iraq , which sought to incorporate methods that were honed in previous interventions .
That these methods bred horrific consequences was of little importance to policy - makers for whom the ends seemingly justify the means .
While differing political contexts have ensured different results historically , there are some patterns that emerge as universal , namely the role of the United States in imparting sophisticated policing equipment and trying to professionalize the internal security apparatus of client regimes as a means of fortifying their power and repressing the political opposition .
New technologies have been developed to try and hasten the efficiency of this latter task , though the overriding goal has remained the same , from the Philippines occupation forward .
American society is at a cross-roads : it can continue to pursue the destructive path of empire , leading to endless cycles of violence and warfare as well as environmental degradation and economic hardship and political repression at home , or it can adopt a more humble , non-violent approach to foreign policy and thus serve as a beacon for world peace while redirecting the country ’s resources towards constructive ends .
There is still time to embrace this latter option , although the Obama administration is moving in the wrong direction , and time is getting short if our civilization is to survive with its moral integrity intact .

In 2006 , the Department of Justice gave Bordenkircher the job of trying to repair the public relations damage bred by the Abu Ghraib scandal and improve conditions for the 80,000 civilian prisoners in Iraqi correctional facilities overseen by the United States – a similar task for which he had been assigned in South Vietnam after the revelation that prisoners had been shackled to the floor in “ Tiger Cages ” at the Con Son facility .
32 Bordenkircher had previously served as a warden of the penitentiary at Moundsville which was characterized by a Chicago based prison reform association as among the worst facilities in the country , owing to infestation with roaches , lice and fleas , having a terrible stench from a lack of proper plumbing and the leaking of raw sewage , having cells that were less than half the size recommended by the American Correctional Association , and having no rehabilitation programs .

If you look at the early days of this blog , when web scalability was still in its heady bloom of youth , many of the articles had to do with leveraging MySQL and memcached .
Exciting times .
Shard MySQL to handle high write loads , cache objects in memcached to handle high read loads , and then write a lot of glue code to make it all work together .
That was state of the art , that was how it was done .
The architecture of many major sites still follow this pattern today , largely because with enough elbow grease , it works .
This was a pre-cloud , relational database dominated world , built from parts scrounged from the remnants of enterprises and datacenters past .
Twitter and Digg started in this era , but are evolving into something different , as scaling pressures increase and new purpose built technologies pop into being .
With a little perspective , it 's clear the MySQL + memcached era is passing .
It will stick around for a while .
Old technologies seldom fade away completely .
Some still ride horses .
Some still use CDs .
And the Internet will not completely replace that archaic electro - magnetic broadcast technology called TV , but the majority will move on into a new era .
LinkedIn has moved on with their Project Voldemort .
Amazon went there a while ago .
Digg declared their entrance into a new era in a post on their blog titled Looking to the future with Cassandra , saying :
The fundamental problem is endemic to the relational database mindset , which places the burden of computation on reads rather than writes .
This is completely wrong for large - scale web applications , where response time is critical .
It ’s made much worse by the serial nature of most applications .
Each component of the page blocks on reads from the data store , as well as the completion of the operations that come before it .
Non-relational data stores reverse this model completely , because they do n’t have the complex read operations of SQL .
Twitter has also declared their move in the article Cassandra @ Twitter : An Interview with Ryan King .
Their reason for changing is :
We have a lot of data , the growth factor in that data is huge and the rate of growth is accelerating .
We have a system in place based on shared mysql + memcache but its quickly becoming prohibitively costly ( in terms of manpower ) to operate .
We need a system that can grow in a more automated fashion and be highly available .
It 's clear that many of the ideas behind MySQL + memcached were on the mark , we see them preserved in the new systems , it 's just that the implementation was a bit clunky .
Developers have moved in , filled the gaps , sanded the corners , and made a new sturdy platform which will itself form the basis for a new ecosystem and a new era .
It 's always a bit sad to see an era pass , but it 's not all that often we get to notice as it's happening .
We can enjoy what has gone before , but we can also get pumped to jump in with both feet and create the future .
And excitingly , that 's what many leading edge companies are doing today .

Fairy Cakes Recipe
My son learnt how to make this fairy cakes recipe when he was in school , and it ’s an extremely easy and delicious recipe , so do try it at home and enjoy with your family or friends !
Ingredients :
Baking powder – 1 ¼ tsp Salt – 1 pinch Margarine – 100 gm Plain flour – 100gm
Ground sugar – 100 gm Eggs – 2
Method :
I posted this tutorial a few years ago and it has become somewhat of a tradition to bring it back every year !
One of our family Easter traditions is dying eggs with pieces of silk .
I saw a cute lady show Martha how to do it a few years ago and I ran upstairs right then to steal a tie !
It ’s way cooler than those cups of neon liquid that end up all over your clothes , your furniture and your hands plus it gives you an excuse to rid a man ’s closet of ugly ties .
Here ’s the run-down :
You need 100 % silk for this to work .
Make sure to check the labels to make sure you ’re not buying polyester , which can look similar .
I grab old ties at the thrift store where they ’re usually pretty cheap .
And remember : when it comes to ties , you may not want ugly ones on your man , but ugly ties do make pretty eggs !
You could also use silk from an old blouse , a scarf , or whatever .
So if you ’re rummaging through a thrift store , check out some other areas as well .
I try to find an assortment of colors and patterns .
Usually dark blues , purples , and reds work the best , but it ’s fun to experiment with all kinds of things .
The interesting thing is that you never know how much of the color and pattern will transfer to the eggs .
Sometimes ties I think will be awesome really disappoint , and ones I did n’t think much of make the most beautiful eggs .
Here ’s some of the ties I grabbed from my local thrift store :
Usually it will tell you if it ’s 100 % silk right on the main label of the tie , but a lot of them do n’t , and if that ’s the case , check that little tiny end , it ’s usually hiding there .
The first step is to deconstruct the tie .
Snip the seams and remove the lining so you are just left with the silk .
( And yes , this old Christian Dior tie , which I love , was only 50 cents at the thrift store !
If it was a skirt , I would totally wear it .
I have gotten many angry comments about the fact that I destroyed a Christian Dior tie .
Honestly , for 50 cents I really do n’t care who ’s name is on it .
Get over it , people ! )
Next you cut a piece large enough to cover an egg .
Wrap the egg with the right side of the fabric making contact with the egg .
The right side is the printed side , or the side that would be on the outside of the tie .
You want to try to wrap the fabric as tight as you can without breaking the egg of course .
The more direct contact the silk has with the egg shell the clearer the imprint of the pattern .
Where there are folds in the fabric you ’ll get kind of a swirly water color effect .
I love those parts - it adds to the charm .
Once wrapped , tie with a piece of string or a twisty tie .
( Do yourself a favor and go with the twisty tie ! )
Now , notice how I tied the eggs in the above photo- with the tie on the top of the long side of the egg .
If you do this , the opposite end of the egg will have the best pattern .
If you are going to be sitting the eggs upright in an egg cup , this is the best way to wrap them .
However , if you want the best part of the design on the wide side of the egg , you ’ll want to wrap them horizontally , like this :
Just wrap them as smoothly and tightly as you can for the best transfer .
I wish eggs came like this at the grocery store .
I would probably buy a lot more eggs if they were dressed up in their silky best .
After the eggs are wrapped in silk , you ’re going to wrap them again with a light colored light weight piece of fabric .
An old pillowcase , sheet , or thin dish cloth is perfect .
If you go to the thrift store to get ties , you may want to grab a pillowcase too .
Otherwise you might get impatient at home and just take one from your kid ’s room .
Do n’t tell my husband I did that .
Put all those little guys in a pot and cover them with water .
Add 1/4 C vinegar and bring it to a boil .
After about 20 minutes you can remove the eggs and set them in a colander or on a towel to dry and cool .
Once they ’re cool enough to handle you can remove the fabric .
This is my favorite part .
I get so antsy waiting for them to cool .
It ’s always a surprise to see what went on in that little package .
Below are some of my results .
I have to say that the first one is probably my favorite egg of all the ones I ’ve ever done .
I ca n’t believe how clearly those flowers transferred and how bold the colors turned out .
Incredible !
Here are some older photos , but still fun to look at .
I absolutely love the cool stripy , swirly thing going on in this one
This is one of the disappointments I talked about .
I was so excited for a green tie and I thought the pattern was cool ( ya know , for an egg ) but it turned out super light and muted .
Still pretty though , kind of like water colors .
I almost did n’t buy this blue tie because it looked boring , but I ’m glad I did .
Remember : bad ties make good eggs !
Try this out and let me know how it goes .
Everyone will wonder how on earth you did it !
Just tell them you ’re a genius .
Or give them our website .
Your choice .
Here you can see the opposite sides of where I tied the silk , they get kind of a swirly watercolor look :
And here are the sides where the silk made the most contact :
If you want to add a little shine , just put a little vegetable oil on a paper down and give them a light rub .
Gorgeous .

Silk Dyed Easter Eggs
from ourbestbites.com
Cut pieces of 100 % silk large enough to cover an egg .
Wrap as smoothy and tightly around egg as possible , with right side of fabric facing in , and secure with a twist - tie or piece of string .
Repeat process , but wrap with a plain piece of lightweight fabric , like an old white pillowcase or sheet .
Place eggs in a large stock pot and cover with water at least 2 inches above eggs .
Add 1/4 cup white vinegar .
Bring pan to a boil and reduce to simmer .
Simmer for 20 minutes and then use a pair of tongs to remove eggs and lay them ( still wrapped ) on layers of paper towels or an old dish towel .
Let cool to room temperature and then remove the fabric wrappings .
Store in the fridge until ready to display .
If desired , rub with a small amount of vegetable oil for shine .

* Frequently Asked Questions *
Do I wrap uncooked or hardboiled eggs in silk ?
Do not wrap up hard - boiled eggs .
Just regular un -cooked eggs from the fridge !
Can you eat the eggs ?
Since you do n’t know what kinds of dyes are used to color the fabrics , and chances are they are n’t food - safe , we do n’t recommend eating the eggs .
Can you make these with blown eggs so you can save them ?
Yes !
Click here for a tutorial on how to blow out eggs , and also turn them into hanging ornaments .
Instructions on how to do silk - dyed eggs with blown out eggs are found in that post .
Will this process work with wooden or ceramic eggs ?
Honestly , I did not know there was such a thing until everyone left comments asking about it on this post !
Readers who have tried this have reported it does not work very well with wooden eggs .
Do I have to wrap the eggs in the plain fabric after the silk ?
I think it does help keep the colors in there next to the egg and therefore make them more vibrant , but if you want to try skipping that step - chances are it will still work just fine .
Does the silk have to be from a neck tie ?
Nope !
Anything that ’s 100 % silk .
A tie , a scarf , a blouse , etc .
Can you re-use the pieces of silk once you use them to dye an egg ?
You can , but the colors will fade a little more each time .
Atlanta , Georgia ( CNN ) --
Photos of the nude and decapitated body of a murdered hiker , sought by a writer on assignment for Hustler magazine , will not be released , a judge in Georgia ordered Wednesday .
The decision came as state lawmakers considered legislation that would ban public release of graphic photos of crime victims .
First Amendment lawyers say the legislation could have a chilling effect on open records requests .
DeKalb Superior Court Judge Daniel Coursey issued a temporary order restraining the Georgia Bureau of Investigation from releasing " any and all photographs , visual images or depictions of Meredith Emerson which show Emerson in an unclothed or dismembered state .
Emerson 's family sought the order after learning of the request for copies of crime scene photos of the 24 - year - old , attorney Lindsay Haigh said .
Emerson 's admitted killer , Gary Michael Hilton , received a life sentence in exchange for leading investigators to her body in the north Georgia mountains on January 7 , 2008 , six days after Emerson disappeared .
The judge 's order came on the same day the Georgia House Governmental Affairs Committee unanimously passed " The Meredith Emerson Memorial Privacy Act , " which would prevent gruesome crime scene photos from being publicly released or disseminated , according to Rep. Jill Chambers , the bill 's principal sponsor .
House Bill 1322 would prevent the release of photographs of the bodies of crime victims that are " nude , bruised , bloodied or in a broken state with open wounds , a state of dismemberment or decapitation , " said Chambers .
" We have to walk the line between open record laws and the constitutional provisions that allow women to be able to be photographed nude or in pornography when they knowingly and willingly offer their bodies for dissemination , " she said .
" Meredith is n't in a position to give that kind of permission to have her exploited in that kind of venue , " Chambers said .
" We 're not only protecting future victims of crime , we 're protecting the integrity of what happened to Meredith . "
The bill allows credentialed journalists , lawyers and law enforcement to view such photographs at the Georgia Bureau of Investigation 's headquarters , Chambers said , but not make copies of them .
Hustler did not respond to a request for comment on the judge 's ruling except to say that it is exploring its legal options .
" Hustler is aware of the GBI 's refusal to honor its reporter 's request for copies of the Emerson crime scenes photos , which were to be used in a news story about this crime .
Hustler and Mr. Flynt disagree with the GBI 's position , and are currently exploring all legal options available to them should the decision be made to go forward with the story , " the company said in an e-mail .
Members of the state Legislature were quick to condemn the request .
" I think that the request is sickening , disgusting , vile and I think it 's very , very hurtful for this family , " House Speaker David Ralston said in a Monday press conference .
Current statute prevents the release of autopsy photos without the permission of next of kin , but a " gray area " in the law left open the question of whether crime scene photos could be released , Ralston said .
" I am a big proponent of open government .
This goes against the grain for me .
But in this case , when you have these kind of photographs that depict victims of crime where there may have been sexual assault or mutilation of the body , I just think it goes beyond the pale , " he said .
" We 're going to narrow it to those situations so we do n't have this kind of situation again where we pause and wonder is this something we have to release or not . "
" Meredith was a daughter , a friend and a mentor to many .
She lived life to its fullest and was taken from us deliberately and maliciously , " her family said on www.righttohikeinc.com, the charity Web site established in Emerson 's memory .
" Her family and friends live everyday with this tragedy and to know that the possibility of any images , other than those that portray the beautiful , young woman we knew , could be disclosed to the public or may be published would bring further stress and unnecessarily added grief over what is already too much sadness to bear . "
The Georgia Bureau of Investigation promptly denied Hustler 's request , agency spokesman John Bankhead said .
" There 's no public interest served by these photographs being publicly displayed , " he said .
" The negative impact on surviving friends and family would be horrific .
They had to go through this with the death so to have to go through it again with the pictures ending up on Internet would be incredible . "
First Amendment lawyers are watching the outcome of this lawsuit and the bill .
" The photos are awful , but it 's also awful to see pictures of people in wars , soldiers fighting or the victims of wars , " said New York attorney Martin Garbus .
" I do n't think there should be any kind of censorship because of awfulness . "
Garbus surmised that privacy laws could be applied in this instance but cautioned that even such laws could be considered limitation of free speech .
" I do n't think you can make it into a narrow context .
If you look at a picture of a Sudanese kid starving to death , or people dying in Haiti , those are invasions of privacy .
Pictures of people alive in tortuous situations in some other country are just as bad as pictures of disfigured corpses in the United States . "

There have been a bunch of posts about the JägerMonkey ( JM ) post that we made the other day , some of which get things subtly wrong about the pieces of technology that are being used as part of Mozilla ’s JM work .
So here ’s the super - quick overview of what we ’re using , what the various parts do and where they came from :
1. SpiderMonkey .
This is Mozilla ’s core JavaScript Interpreter .
This engine takes raw JavaScript and turns it into an intermediate bytecode .
That bytecode is then interpreted .
SpiderMonkey was responsible for all JavaScript handling in Firefox 3 and earlier .
We continue to make improvements to this engine , as it ’s still the basis for a lot of work that we did in Firefox 3.5 , 3.6 and later releases as well .
2. Tracing .
Tracing was added before Firefox 3.5 and was responsible for much of the big jump that we made in performance .
( Although some of that was because we also improved the underlying SpiderMonkey engine as well . )
This is what we do to trace :
Monitor interpreted JavaScript code during execution looking for code paths that are used more than once .
When we find a piece of code that ’s used more than once , optimize that code .
Take that optimized representation and assemble it to machine code and execute it .
What we ’ve found since Firefox 3.5 is that when we ’re in full tracing mode , we ’re really really fast .
We ’re slow when we have to “ fall back ” to SpiderMonkey and interpret + record .
One difficult part of tracing is generating code that runs fast .
This is done by a piece of code called Nanojit .
Nanojit is a piece of code that was originally part of the Tamarin project .
Mozilla is n’t using most of Tamarin for two reasons : 1 . we ’re not shipping ECMAScript 4 and 2 . the interpreted part of Tamarin was much slower than SpiderMonkey .
For Firefox 3.5 we took the best part – Nanojit – and bolted it to the back of SpiderMonkey instead .
Nanojit does two things : it takes a high - level representation of JavaScript and does optimization .
It also includes an assembler to take that optimized representation and generate native code for machine - level execution .
Mozilla and Adobe continue to collaborate on Nanojit .
Adobe uses Nanojit as part of their ActionScript VM .
3. Nitro Assembler .
This is a piece of code that we ’re taking from Apple ’s version of webkit that generates native code for execution .
The Nitro Assembler is very different than Nanojit .
While Nanojit takes a high - level representation , does optimization and then generates code all the Nitro Assembler does is generate code .
So it ’s complex , low - level code , but it does n’t do the same set of things that Nanojit does .
We ’re using the Nitro assembler ( along with a lot of other new code ) to basically build what everyone else has – compiled JavaScript – and then we ’re going to do what we did with Firefox 3.5 – bolt tracing onto the back of that .
So we ’ll hopefully have the best of all worlds : SpiderMonkey generating native code to execute like the other VMs with the ability to go onto trace for tight inner loops for even more performance .
I hope this helps to explain what bits of technology we ’re using and how they fit into the overall picture of Firefox ’s JS performance .
At least 15 people have been killed and more than 100 injured in a suicide bomb attack on a militant gathering in north - western Pakistan , officials say .
The bomber had blown himself up among pro-Taliban militants meeting in a compound by a crowded market selling hashish , a witness told the BBC .
Customers at the market were among those killed and injured in the blast .
It happened in the Khyber tribal region close to the Afghan border , where the Taliban have a strong presence .
Over the past year north - west Pakistan has been hit by numerous attacks .
The army recently finished an offensive in the area against the Taliban .
According to a witness , the bomber walked in among militants attending a lecture session of the pro-Taliban Lashkar - e - Islam group at their compound in the Tirah valley and blew himself up .
Local people say he was able to slip past the large number of guards undetected because of the crowds visiting the market set up next to the compound , the BBC's Syed Shoaib Hasan in Islamabad says .
Reports from the area suggest the second - in - command of Lashkar - e - Islam , one of the biggest militant organisations in the Khyber , was killed in the blast , our correspondent says .
Although no - one has yet claimed responsibility , a rival militant group is believed to be behind the attack , our correspondent adds .
The injured have been taken to hospitals in the area .
Officials say they expect the death toll to rise .
Hundreds of people have died in clashes between Lashkar - e - Islam and another armed Islamic group , Ansarul Islam , both of which are banned by the government , in the region in the past few years .
Locals say government helicopters have recently helped Ansarul Islam - now re-named the Peace Committee - during clashes with Lashkar - e - Islam .
A hacker who pulled off one of the biggest credit and debit cards scams in U.S. history was sentenced to 20 years behind bars Thursday .
A hacker who pulled off one of the biggest credit and debit cards scams in U.S. history was sentenced to 20 years behind bars Thursday .
Albert Gonzalez , known online as " SoupNazi " , pleaded guilty last year to hacking into the computer systems of Heartland Payment systems , which handled credit card processing for stores like TJ Maxx , BJ's Wholesale Club , Barnes & Noble , OfficeMax , and Boston Market , according to ABC News .
With the information in hand , Gonzalez drove by the physical stores , accessed their wireless Internet signals , and planted a Trojan Horse program that he used to credit card data .
He stole more than 40 million credit card account numbers , and re-sold them to international clients via Web chats , the Financial Times reports .
Working with other scammers here and overseas , Gonzalez wracked up about $ 200 million in damages , and personally took home about $ 2.8 million .
The 20 - year sentence , the longest ever for hacking , was handed down for stealing and selling the credit card information .
A second sentence  for hacking into Heartland Payment  will be handed down today , but is expected to be served concurrently .
The Heartland hack , FT says , cost an additional $ 130 million in damages .
Visiting the U.S. for the first time has to be weird for foreigners .
This has been the case for as long as America has been a nation , and in fact a French guy made quite a name for himself writing about our peculiarities for a Continental audience over two centuries ago .
We 've always been a bit " different " and like most countries we 're rather proud of ( some of ) our unique attributes .
But I think we are starting to overdo it with the cognitive dissonance .
We 're far and away the wealthiest nation on Earth but we sure as hell do n't look like it .
We 've built a magnificent castle of wealth on top of crumbling , centuries - old infrastructure in which no one seems willing or able to invest .
The effect is not unlike seeing a decrepit trailer park with a 2010 Bugatti Veyron parked out front .
Two anecdotes are relevant before we move on .
First , I have a friend who was raised in Berlin Wall - era Eastern Europe .
I once asked her to recount her impression , having been raised in a much different society and subject to considerable anti-American propaganda , of seeing America for the first time .
She responded that she was amazed at how shabby it was ( being in the South at the time did n't help ) .
Potholed , filthy streets lined with boarded up buildings .
Trash everywhere .
Public transportation systems that would embarrass any other nation on Earth .
Say what you will about the failings of the Communist system , she concluded , but at least it was clean and looked like someone gave a shit about it .
Second , the company at which I worked in Chicago for several years briefly took in a Kenyan exchange student studying law at a university in the city .
He accompanied me on a field visit to a hospital in the decrepit Austin neighborhood on the far west side .
He surveyed the neighborhood and said " This looks exactly like Nairobi . "
That made me incredibly sad .
It did n't help 30 seconds later when he added " Actually , most of Nairobi is nicer than this . "
I do n't think many Americans understand this .
We raise our children to believe that everyone else in the world wants to come live in America .
Most of us , I think , believe that America looks terribly impressive to foreign visitors .
I seriously doubt that Los Angeles is impressive to a traveler .
Other countries have shitholes too , so I assume most visitors have seen one before .
Pictured : St. Louis .
Or maybe Mogadishu .
I do n't know .
The NYT has recently emphasized the fact that most major cities ' sewage networks are crumbling .
Many date back to the 19th Century and are literally leaking shit into our water .
Our roads and bridges are disintegrating ( and occasionally fails at considerable economic and human cost ) .
Our society and economy rest upon a " third world power grid " that occasionally fails spectacularly .
The average African country has better , newer , cheaper cell phone infrastructure .
We lose ( waste ) seven billion gallons of clean , treated water every day through the leaks in our water system .
The American Society of Civil Engineers estimates that it would take a five year investment of over two trillion dollars to bring the nation 's road , levee , and utility infrastructure up to a passing grade .
Not even an A. Just a C .
And this does n't even include general urban blight – the collapsing tenements , abandoned businesses , and wagon - rut roads .
Our theory , aided considerably by how continuously broke state and local governments are , seems to be of the patch - and - pray variety : do just enough to prevent total collapse and hope it holds up .
We did precious little to address this with the Federal stimulus package , most likely because the right would have gone into hysterics over infrastructure projects as a Trojan Horse for funneling kickbacks to organized labor .
Not that we could use blue collar jobs these days .
It makes perfect sense that Americans , like many people , adopt the ego - defensive position that we live in a great place .
While we certainly do n't need anything else to be sad about these days , I can't help but wonder why more people do not look around and think , " Wow .
Was this place always such a dump ? "
Instead we tell ourselves that billions of people around the globe secretly long to live in Spartanburg or Waco or Merced .
Sure they do , Billy .
Sure they do .

Female pilots who flew planes during World War II got long - overdue recognition March 10 when they received the Congressional Gold Medal , the highest civilian honor given by Congress , in a ceremony on Capitol Hill , The Kansas City Star reported March 10 .
About 200 women who served as Women Airforce Service Pilots , or WASPs , were on hand .
Most of the women are now in their late 80s and early 90s .
The WASP were the first women to fly American military aircraft .
However , though they flew planes during World War II , they were n’t considered " real " military pilots .
No flags were draped over their coffins if they died on duty and when their service ended , they had to pay their own bus fare home , the article reported .
" Women Airforce Service Pilots , we are all your daughters ; you taught us how to fly , " said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi .
She said the pilots went unrecognized for too long , even though their service blazed a trail for other women in the U.S. military .

Protect your children from state officials
( NaturalNews ) A six - year - old Brooklyn girl , Nikiyah Torres - Pierre , was hospitalized recently after being injected with the swine flu vaccine .
The vaccination was conducted entirely without her parents ' permission in an incident school nurses are calling " a mistake .
" Mother Naomi Troy told the NY Daily News , " I was outraged . "
After receiving the swine flu injection , her daughter complained she was itching and her stomach was hurting .
That 's when school officials called an ambulance that rushed Nikiyah to the hospital .
Nikiyah is epileptic and takes prescription medication to treat the condition .
Her mother was concerned about the possible side effects of combining a swine flu vaccine shot with epilepsy drugs and was waiting to hear back from her doctor before giving the school permission to vaccinate her daughter .
That permission was apparently irrelevant , as some schools simply vaccinate any and all children without concern for parental permission .
After injecting her daughter without permission , the school nurse then called Naomi Troy and tried to persuade her to sign a consent form after the fact .
" I was insulted .
I was really angry , " said Naomi .
So far , 1,800 NY students have been vaccinated against swine flu .
Hundreds of thousands more are in line to be vaccinated when a sufficient supply of vaccines is made available .
What this incident demonstrates is the important need for parents to .
Even without your permission , your children can be called to the nurse 's office and forcibly injected with a substance that could harm or kill them .
You , the parent , might be called after the fact -- your child winds up in the hospital , suffering from bizarre side effects even though doctors swore the vaccine was " perfectly safe .
" Every day that you send your child to a public school , you run the risk that the next time you see your child , it may be in the hospital ... or the morgue .
Many state Dept. of Health employees who serve as school nurses do n't pay any attention to parental permission .
They just inject every child they can get their hands on .
And even if your child faints , or collapses into a coma , or even dies from the side effects of the vaccine , they 'll claim such things are " pure coincidence " and could n't be caused by the vaccine itself .
How do they know that ?
Because they 've been told " the vaccine is safe . "
And they believe it .
If you have a child in the public school system -- and you do n't want them to be vaccinated with the H1N1 vaccines -- you need toby writing a strongly - worded note informing your school principal ( and nursing staff ) that if your child is vaccinated without your permission , you will sue for damages .
As a public service to NaturalNews readers , I 've written and posted precisely such a letter that you can freely use for this purpose .
You 'll find it here : https://www.naturalnews.com/027394_swine_flu_...
Use this letter to Do n't let the schools inject your child with a potentially harmful chemical substance .

MOGADISHU , Somalia —
For the past three years , the Shabab , one of Africa ’s most fearsome militant Islamist groups , have been terrorizing the Somali public , chopping off hands , stoning people to death and banning TV , music and even bras in their quest to turn Somalia into a seventh - century - style Islamic state .
At the same time , they have drawn increasingly close to Al Qaeda , deploying suicide bombers , attracting jihadists from around the world and prompting American concerns that they may be spreading into Kenya , Yemen and beyond .
But could Somalia finally be reaching a tipping point against the Shabab ?
Not only is Somalia ’s transitional government gearing up for a major offensive against the Shabab — with the American military providing intelligence and logistical support — but Mogadishu ’s beleaguered population , sensing a change in the salt - sticky air , is beginning to turn against them .
Women who have been whipped and humiliated by morality police for not veiling their faces are now whispering valuable secrets about the Shabab ’s movements into the ears of government soldiers .
Teenage students outraged that Shabab - allied fighters hoisted a black flag in front of their school recently pelted the fighters with stones .
Defectors are leaving the Shabab in droves , including one 13 - year - old who said that he was routinely drugged before being handed a machine gun and shoved into combat .

Freedom Alliance Responds to Allegations Against Sean Hannityby Freedom Alliance
Dear Friends of Freedom Alliance :
This week , false and malicious allegations about Freedom Alliance were posted on the Internet and we want to address them with you .
We do n’t know the motivation for these vicious smears , but we will not allow them to go unanswered .
Debbie hits back

In fact , it ’s far worse than I originally reported .
The scam is far bigger .
And it ’s big business .
. . . for cronies and friends of Sean Hannity and Oliver North .
I ’ll be writing more in the coming days about the Freedom Alliance , itself , and where the money the charity receives is really going .
I diaried this a couple of days ago

So now CREW have gotten interested it seems
http://www.earthtimes.org/...
WASHINGTON - ( Business Wire ) Today , Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington ( CREW ) filed complaints with the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) and the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) against Sean Hannity , his Freedom Concerts , the Freedom Alliance and Lt. Col.
Oliver North .
Copies of the complaints were also sent to the attorney generals of the states in which concerts are scheduled to be held this summer .
Not sure if this is another one that includes a complaint from Vets or if it is the same complaint

CREW will host a joint press conference Monday with VoteVets.org discussing complaints with the IRS and the Federal Trade Commission about Freedom Concert , Freedom Alliance , and Lt. Col. Oliver North .
Freedom Concerts events have been organized by Premier Marketing , according to conservative blogger Debbie Schlussel and CREW .
Premier Marketing is operated by Duane Ward , the speaking engagement agent for both Sean Hannity and Oliver North , according to Schlussel .

The 25 - year - old worker made lewd comments after his colleague Jo Margetson , 29 , mistakenly strayed into the scanner , which can see through clothes to produce an image of the body , the Sun newspaper reported .
The case is believed to be the first of its kind since the full - body scanners were rushed into service at a number of British airports in the wake of an attempt by a suspected Muslim extremist to blow up a plane bound for Detroit on December 25 .
They are now being rolled out at airports across the world .
Details of the incident at Heathrow ’s Terminal 5 on March 10 emerged on the day lawmakers said concerns that the scanners were intrusive had been overblown .
Margetson told the Sun she had been “ traumatized ” by what had happened and had informed police and her bosses at the airport ’s operator BAA .
“ We treat any allegations of inappropriate behavior or misuse of security equipment very seriously and these claims are being investigated thoroughly , ” said a spokeswoman for BAA .
“ If found to be substantiated , we will take appropriate action . ”
A Metropolitan Police spokesman said officers had been informed of the allegation and “ a first instance harassment warning has been issued to a 25 - year - old man . ”
Opponents of scanners have argued since their introduction that they risked breaching individuals ’ rights to privacy .
Britain ’s Equality and Human Rights Commission has already said they might be breaking discrimination and privacy laws .
“ For every official caught ogling like this , there are plenty more eyeing up law - abiding travelers , ” Alex Deane , director of the Big Brother Watch campaign group , told the Sun .
“ These expensive machines are totally disproportionate . ”
The government says staff using the machines are properly supervised and would not be able to see the person being scanned .
All images are deleted .
Britain ’s parliamentary Home Affairs Committee said fears about the scanners were misplaced and they should be introduced at a faster pace to deal with the threat of terrorism .
“ The Committee is satisfied that the privacy concerns that have been expressed in relation to these devices are overstated and ... should not prevent the deployment of scanners , ” it said in a report .
Black fathers urged to be more involved with children
David Lammy will call for fathers to remain in touch with their children Black fathers need to become more involved with their children to help tackle social problems among young people , a government minister will say .
Prominent black MP David Lammy will tell the Runnymede race think tank that fathers must take more responsibility .
In a speech on Monday , he will say this would address issues such as education underachievement and high crime rates .
The higher education minister will also praise women in families where fathers are either absent or uninvolved .
In the event to link in with Mothering Sunday , he will say : " What many women want for Mothers ' Day can't be given by their children - it is more engaged fathers . "
' Emotional bond '
Mr Lammy will touch on figures that suggest 59 % of black Caribbean and 44 % of black African children grow up in single - parent families .
" The mark of a man is not how many children he spawns but how he matches up as a father , " he will say .
Mr Lammy will also call for fathers from all backgrounds to remain in touch with their children whatever the relationship with their mothers .
He will say : " Between a quarter and a third of children with separated parents have little or no contact with their fathers .
" It is not just the structure of families that matters .
It is whether fathers continue to contribute to their children 's lives . "
He will argue that " modern fatherhood needs updating from the traditional model " , saying that young people need " an emotional bond with their father " .
The speech at the House of Commons will be accompanied by recorded video interviews with leading black figures such as broadcaster Sir Trevor McDonald and chart - topping rapper Tinie Tempah .
Sir Trevor said his father had a major influence on his life .
He told Mr Lammy : " My father always said ' Reach for the stars and you may get to the top of the trees , but you have to aim high ' . "

Atheist Agenda , a campus group at U Texas San Antonio , has created a " Smut for Smut " program , where they 'll trade you high - grade porn in exchange for your Bibles and other religious material .
The idea is to highlight that the Bible is as full of bad ideas and bad depictions of those ideas ( " a woman is worth half a man " ) as pornography .
Many of my friends espouse some kind of faith , and it 's clear to me that they get some good out of it .
My feeling is that religion and faith , like music or sports or drugs or creativity , is a way of making parts of your brain light up in a way that is pleasurable and that often encourages you to do good .
I think that part of it is good .
But just like all of those things , religion and faith make some people do bad things , as they find pathological ways of evoking the pleasurable sensation in their minds .
I also think that the pleasurable sensation that attends the numinous state is a powerful conditioner of behavior , and that it can be exploited to get people to do terrible things ( cf violent religious extremism ) , or merely things that are not good for them ( deferring to religious authorities with bad ideas , giving money they can't afford to religious causes ) .
Well , we have Bronze Aged tribal nonsense , these things written by people in tents ages ago , and we 're using this to renounce science standards in our classrooms in America .
We 're using it to kind of influence our political agenda .
And we 've read it .
Atheists actually tend to be rather knowledgeable about scripture , and we are using this as a medium to get people to know what 's actually within the religious text that they hold so dear .

On March 10 , I posted on the humiliation heaped on Vice President Joe Biden by the Israeli government of far - right Likud leader Binyamin Netanyahu .
Biden went to Israel intending to help kick off indirect negotiations between Netanyahu and Palestine Authority president Mahmoud Abbas .
Biden had no sooner arrived than the Israelis announced that they would build 1600 new households on Palestinian territory that they had unilaterally annexed to Jerusalem .
Since expanding Israeli colonization of Palestinian land had been the sticking point causing Abbas to refuse to engage in negotiations , and , indeed , to threaten to resign , this step was sure to scuttle the very talks Biden had come to inaugurate .
And it did .
The tiff between the US and Israel is less important than the worrisome growth of tension between Palestinians and Israelis as the Israelis have claimed more and more sites sacred to the Palestinians as well .
There is talk of a third Intifada or Palestinian uprising .
As part of my original posting , I mirrored a map of modern Palestinian history that has the virtue of showing graphically what has happened to the Palestinians politically and territorially in the past century .
Andrew Sullivan then mirrored the map from my site , which set off a lot of thunder and noise among anti-Palestinian writers like Jeffrey Goldberg of the Atlantic , but shed very little light .
( PS , the map as a hard copy mapcard is available from Sabeel . )
The map is useful and accurate .
It begins by showing the British Mandate of Palestine as of the mid-1920s .
The British conquered the Ottoman districts that came to be the Mandate during World War I ( the Ottoman sultan threw in with Austria and Germany against Britain , France and Russia , mainly out of fear of Russia ) .
But because of the rise of the League of Nations and the influence of President Woodrow Wilson ’s ideas about self - determination , Britain and France could not decently simply make their new , previously Ottoman territories into mere colonies .
The League of Nations awarded them “ Mandates . ” Britain got Palestine , France got Syria ( which it made into Syria and Lebanon ) , Britain got Iraq .
The League of Nations Covenant spelled out what a Class A Mandate ( i.e. territory that had been Ottoman ) was :
“ Article 22 .
Certain communities formerly belonging to the Turkish Empire have reached a stage of development where their existence as independent nations can be provisionally recognised subject to the rendering of administrative advice and assistance by a Mandatory [ i.e. , a Western power ] until such time as they are able to stand alone .
The wishes of these communities must be a principal consideration in the selection of the Mandatory . ”
That is , the purpose of the later British Mandate of Palestine , of the French Mandate of Syria , of the British Mandate of Iraq , was to ‘ render administrative advice and assistance ” to these peoples in preparation for their becoming independent states , an achievement that they were recognized as not far from attaining .
The Covenant was written before the actual Mandates were established , but Palestine was a Class A Mandate and so the language of the Covenant was applicable to it .
The territory that formed the British Mandate of Iraq was the same territory that became independent Iraq , and the same could have been expected of the British Mandate of Palestine .
( Even class B Mandates like Togo have become nation - states , but the poor Palestinians are just stateless prisoners in colonial cantons ) .
The first map thus shows what the League of Nations imagined would become the state of Palestine .
The economist published an odd assertion that the Negev Desert was ’ empty ’ and should not have been shown in the first map .
But it was n’t and is n’t empty ; Palestinian Bedouin live there , and they and the desert were recognized by the League of Nations as belonging to the Mandate of Palestine , a state - in - training .
The Mandate of Palestine also had a charge to allow for the establishment of a ‘ homeland ’ in Palestine for Jews ( because of the 1917 Balfour Declaration ) , but nobody among League of Nations officialdom at that time imagined it would be a whole and competing territorial state .
There was no prospect of more than a few tens of thousands of Jews settling in Palestine , as of the mid-1920s .
( They are shown in white on the first map , refuting those who mysteriously complained that the maps alternated between showing sovereignty and showing population ) .
As late as the 1939 British White Paper , British officials imagined that the Mandate would emerge as an independent Palestinian state within 10 years .
In 1851 , there had been 327,000 Palestinians ( yes , the word ‘ Filistin ’ was current then ) and other non-Jews , and only 13,000 Jews .
In 1925 , after decades of determined Jewish immigration , there were a little over 100,000 Jews , and there were 765,000 mostly Palestinian non-Jews in the British Mandate of Palestine .
For historical demography of this area , see Justin McCarthy ’s painstaking calculations ; it is not true , as sometimes is claimed , that we cannot know anything about population figures in this region .
See also his journal article , reprinted at this site .
The Palestinian population grew because of rapid population growth , not in - migration , which was minor .
The common allegation that Jerusalem had a Jewish majority at some point in the 19th century is meaningless .
Jerusalem was a small town in 1851 , and many pious or indigent elderly Jews from Eastern Europe and elsewhere retired there because of charities that would support them .
In 1851 , Jews were only about 4 % of the population of the territory that became the British Mandate of Palestine some 70 years later .
And , there had been few adherents of Judaism , just a few thousand , from the time most Jews in Palestine adopted Christianity and Islam in the first millennium CE all the way until the 20th century .
In the British Mandate of Palestine , the district of Jerusalem was largely Palestinian .
The rise of the Nazis in the 1930s impelled massive Jewish emigration to Palestine , so by 1940 there were over 400,000 Jews there amid over a million Palestinians .
The second map shows the United Nations partition plan of 1947 , which awarded Jews ( who only then owned about 6 % of Palestinian land ) a substantial state alongside a much reduced Palestine .
Although apologists for the Zionist movement say that the Zionists accepted this partition plan and the Arabs rejected it , that is not entirely true .
Zionist leader David Ben Gurion noted in his diary when Israel was established that when the US had been formed , no document set out its territorial extent , implying that the same was true of Israel .
We know that Ben Gurion was an Israeli expansionist who fully intended to annex more land to Israel , and by 1956 he attempted to add the Sinai and would have liked southern Lebanon .
So the Zionist “ acceptance ” of the UN partition plan did not mean very much beyond a happiness that their initial starting point was much better than their actual land ownership had given them any right to expect .
The third map shows the status quo after the Israeli - Palestinian civil war of 1947 - 1948 .
It is not true that the entire Arab League attacked the Jewish community in Palestine or later Israel on behalf of the Palestinians .
As Avi Shlaim has shown , Jordan had made an understanding with the Zionist leadership that it would grab the West Bank , and its troops did not mount a campaign in the territory awarded to Israel by the UN .
Egypt grabbed Gaza and then tried to grab the Negev Desert , with a few thousand badly trained and equipped troops , but was defeated by the nascent Israeli army .
Few other Arab states sent any significant number of troops .
The total number of troops on the Arab side actually on the ground was about equal to those of the Zionist forces , and the Zionists had more esprit de corps and better weaponry .
The final map shows the situation today , which springs from the Israeli occupation of Gaza and the West Bank in 1967 and then the decision of the Israelis to colonize the West Bank intensively ( a process that is illegal in the law of war concerning occupied populations ) .
There is nothing inaccurate about the maps at all , historically .
Goldberg maintained that the Palestinians ’ ‘ original sin ’ was rejecting the 1947 UN partition plan .
But since Ben Gurion and other expansionists went on to grab more territory later in history , it is not clear that the Palestinians could have avoided being occupied even if they had given away willingly so much of their country in 1947 .
The first original sin was the contradictory and feckless pledge by the British to sponsor Jewish immigration into their Mandate in Palestine , which they wickedly and fantastically promised would never inconvenience the Palestinians in any way .
It was the same kind of original sin as the French policy of sponsoring a million colons in French Algeria , or the French attempt to create a Christian - dominated Lebanon where the Christians would be privileged by French policy .
The second original sin was the refusal of the United States to allow Jews to immigrate in the 1930s and early 1940s , which forced them to go to Palestine to escape the monstrous , mass - murdering Nazis .
The map attracted so much ire and controversy not because it is inaccurate but because it clearly shows what has been done to the Palestinians , which the League of Nations had recognized as not far from achieving statehood in its Covenant .
Their statehood and their territory has been taken from them , and they have been left stateless , without citizenship and therefore without basic civil and human rights .
The map makes it easy to see this process .
The map had to be stigmatized and made taboo .
But even if that marginalization of an image could be accomplished , the squalid reality of Palestinian statelessness would remain , and the children of Gaza would still be being malnourished by the deliberate Israeli policy of blockading civilians .
The map just points to a powerful reality ; banishing the map does not change that reality .
Goldberg , according to Spencer Ackerman , says that he will stop replying to Andrew Sullivan , for which Ackerman is grateful , since , he implies , Goldberg is a propagandistic hack who loves to promote wars on flimsy pretenses .
Matthew Yglesias also has some fun at Goldberg ’s expense .
People like Goldberg never tell us what they expect to happen to the Palestinians in the near and medium future .
They do n’t seem to understand that the status quo is untenable .
They are like militant ostriches , hiding their heads in the sand while lashing out with their hind talons at anyone who stares clear - eyed at the problem , characterizing us as bigots .
As if that old calumny has any purchase for anyone who knows something serious about the actual views of Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu or Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman , more bigoted persons than whom would be difficult to find .
Indeed , some of Israel ’s current problems with Brazil come out of Lieberman ’s visit there last summer ; I was in Rio then and remember the distaste with which the multi-cultural , multi-racial Brazilians viewed Lieberman , whom some openly called a racist .

A low - power , sensor system developed at the University of Michigan 1,000 times smaller than comparable commercial counterparts .
It could enable new biomedical implants .
Photo by : Daeyeon Kim
( PhysOrg.com ) -- A 9-cubic millimeter solar - powered sensor system developed at the University of Michigan is the smallest that can harvest energy from its surroundings to operate nearly perpetually .
The U - M system ’s processor , solar cells , and battery are all contained in its tiny frame , which measures 2.5 by 3.5 by 1 millimeters .
It is 1,000 times smaller than comparable commercial counterparts .
The system could enable new biomedical implants as well as home - , building - and bridge - monitoring devices .
It could vastly improve the efficiency and cost of current environmental sensor networks designed to detect movement or track air and water quality .
With an industry - standard ARM Cortex - M3 processor , the system contains the lowest - powered commercial - class microcontroller .
It uses about 2,000 times less power in sleep mode than its most energy - efficient counterpart on the market today .
The engineers say successful use of an ARM processor — the industry ’s most popular 32 - bit processor architecture — is an important step toward commercial adoption of this technology .
Greg Chen , a computer science and engineering doctoral student , will present the research Feb. 9 at the International Solid - State Circuits Conference in San Francisco .
“ Our system can run nearly perpetually if periodically exposed to reasonable lighting conditions , even indoors , ” said David Blaauw , an electrical and computer engineering professor .
“ Its only limiting factor is battery wear - out , but the battery would last many years . ”
“ The ARM Cortex - M3 processor has been widely adopted throughout the microcontroller industry for its low - power , energy efficient features such as deep sleep mode and Wake - Up Interrupt Controller , which enables the core to be placed in ultra- low leakage mode , returning to fully active mode almost instantaneously , ” said Eric Schorn , vice president , marketing , processor division , ARM .
“ This implementation of the processor exploits all of those features to the maximum to achieve an ultra - low - power operation . ”
The sensor spends most of its time in sleep mode , waking briefly every few minutes to take measurements .
Its total average power consumption is less than 1 nanowatt .
A nanowatt is one - billionth of a watt .
The developers say the key innovation is their method for managing power .
The processor only needs about half of a volt to operate , but its low - voltage , thin - film Cymbet battery puts out close to 4 volts .
The voltage , which is essentially the pressure of the electric current , must be reduced for the system to function most efficiently .
“ If we used traditional methods , the voltage conversion process would have consumed many times more power than the processor itself uses , ” said Dennis Sylvester , an associate professor in electrical and computer engineering .
One way the U - M engineers made the voltage conversion more efficient is by slowing the power management unit ’s clock when the processor ’s load is light .
“ We skip beats if we determine the voltage is sufficiently stable , ” Sylvester said .
The designers are working with doctors on potential medical applications .
The system could enable less - invasive ways to monitor pressure changes in the eyes , brain , and in tumors in patients with glaucoma , head trauma , or cancer .
In the body , the sensor could conceivably harvest energy from movement or heat , rather than light , the engineers say .
The inventors are working to commercialize the technology through a company led by Scott Hanson , a research fellow in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science .
The paper is entitled “ Millimeter - Scale Nearly Perpetual Sensor System with Stacked Battery and Solar Cells . ”

Und natürlich funktioniert es auf Deutsch ( mit Jan-Josef Liefers ) nicht so gut :
To help correct what has been a decided bias by this newspaper in favor of the working class and its allies , we hereby help put things in balance by offering news of interest to the rich and famous :
Hedge funds make comeback
Researchers at the Hennessee Group , an investment firm , posted the great news this week that hedge funds have “ totally recovered ” from the “ economic unpleasantness of 2008 . ”
In fact , assets in hedge funds rose by $ 751 billion in 2009 .
Improvement of that magnitude will allow the top 25 hedge fund managers to do what they have n’t been able to do since 2007 , a year before the “ unpleasantness ” began .
Estimates are that they can each , once again , pocket more than $ 360 million in annual salaries .
In other good news for the hedge fund managers , the Washington Post reports that efforts to plug the “ carried interest ” tax loophole that lets hedge fund managers treat their income as capital gains ( with lower tax rates ) have “ lost momentum in the Senate . ”
The hope is that the mean - spiritedness exhibited in the House last December , when it voted to raise the tax on hedge fund manager income from 15 to 35 percent , will not be repeated by senators who generally have a better understanding of problems faced by the rich .
Forbes fingers the culprit
Forbes magazine , beloved by big business for being a “ capitalist tool , ” last month revealed both the cause and the cure for large federal deficits .
Taking note of the “ obscene ” paychecks earned by public workers , the magazine said cutting pay for millions of government workers is “ the only way to get serious about the deficit . ”
A 10 percent salary cut for all federal , state and local government non-teaching employees , Forbes said , “ could generate almost $ 40 billion a year . ”
The beauty of the Forbes proposal is that , while protecting the rich , it raises almost exactly the same amount that would be raised if the top 400 earners in the United States paid the same income tax rate that applied to them in 1955 .
Dangerous idea in Wales
The Welsh government , in response to the desire of its people to be happier , has decided to undertake a program of tracking national progress on happiness .
Statistics are being gathered to compute an index of “ Gross National Happiness . ”
Helen Mary Jones , a member of the Welsh National Assembly leading the study , says gross domestic product and other traditional economic indicators do n’t always get at what it is that really enhances “ subjective well - being . ”
In short , she says , “ the best societies to live in are n’t always the wealthiest .
The best societies appear to be nations where wealth is shared more equally . ”
It ai n’t easy being rich
Russian billionaire Mikhail Prokhorov is apparently the victim of a scam .
Accustomed to making offers that ca n’t be refused , he was taken aback in 2005 when the widow of banker - billionaire Edmond Safra said “ no ” when he tried to buy her cliff - top mansion on the French Riviera .
Determined to get what he wanted , he kept upping his offer – all the way up to $ 534 million , the highest price ever offered for a private home .
As much as she loved the mansion , Lily Safra could no longer resist and , in 2008 , agreed to sell the joint to Prokhorov who immediately put down a $ 55 million dollar deposit .
Soon after he put down the money the global recession hit and his worldwide operations started to go belly - up .
He reneged on the sale and demanded his deposit back .
Safra refused .
Now , to add to his humiliation , pain and suffering , French courts have ruled in her favor and have ordered him to pay an additional $ 2 million in damages .
Et tu , Wall Street Journal ?
What ’s this world coming to when even the Wall Street Journal ca n’t be trusted to refrain from bashing the rich ?
The following is excerpted from a recent article in the paper :
“ Corporations are now busily reporting CEO pay totals for 2009 , but take those totals with a grain of salt .
The figures now being released value stock awards to each executive at the time of their grant .
Actual rewards can run far higher .
One example : Occidental Petroleum CEO
Ray Irani took ‘ expected pay ’ for 2008 originally valued at $ 58.3 million .
His actual ‘ realized ’ pay for the year : $ 222.6 million .

We ’re making a handmade plantable greeting card , where the flower seeds are mixed right in with the paper .
When it is planted in the ground and given lots of TLC , it will bloom into beautiful flowers you can enjoy !
It ’s such a satisfying craft to make that keeps on giving and giving !
Handmade Greeting Cards You Can Plant
I ’m sure all your friends and family would love to receive this card in the mail , such a fun gift to get !
Here is a tutorial for a project using seed paper .
Supplies :
craft or art paper
blender
water – enough to cover the paper inside the blender
flower seeds
stirring spoon
colander or cloth towel
piece of felt
white paper card folded
glue or tape
pens or colored pencils
Instructions :
First , you need to make the paper .
Use paper you have around your house .
This is a great way to recycle old scraps .
Tear them up into small pieces and place in a blender .
Add enough water in the blender so the paper is covered and blend .
When your paper is nice and evenly blended you can add your seeds .
Unplug your blender and use a wooden spoon to gently stir the seeds into the paper mush .
Do not blend them !
Now it is ready to be shaped .
Place a colander in the sink and pour the paper mush into it .
If you have large holes in your colander like I do , go ahead and place a towel in it to catch the pulp , but not the water .
Place a towel on the counter and if you have a piece of felt , place the felt on top of the towel .
Then gently pour your seeds and paper pulp on the felt and spread evenly out .
Take another towel and press it down on the paper pulp to help dry the excess water .
You can now blow dry the paper or let it sit out overnight to dry .
When your paper is dry , cut it out into a flower shape .
Make a simple card with cardstock and glue the flower to your card .
Feel free to get creative here and draw , stamp , or cut out a stem .
If you do n’t like flowers , make a cute butterfly or tree .
The options are endless and no matter what shape you choose–it will be a hit with the recipient of the card .
You ’re done and your flower seed card is ready to plant !
Make sure you add a message somewhere on your card to let the recipient know they can plant it !
The United States Court of Appeals has ruled that three Seattle police officers were justified when they tasered a pregnant mother three times when she refused to sign a traffic ticket .
Malaika Brooks was driving her son to Seattle ’s African American Academy in 2004 when she was stopped for doing 32 mph in a school zone .
When she refused to get out of her car to be arrested , one officer tasered her repeatedly despite ( she claims ) knowing that she was pregnant .
The officers – Sgt. Steven Daman , Officer Juan Ornelas and Officer Donald Jones – hit her in the thigh , shoulder and neck and then hauled her out of the car and laid her face - down in the street .
While the baby was born two months later without injury , the mother has permanent scars from the taserings .
Judges Cynthia Holcomb Hall and Diarmuid F. O’Scannlain ruled that the officers were justified in making an arrest because Brooks was obstructing them and resisting arrest .
The judges insisted that , while surrounded by police and the car turned off , she still was a danger : “ It seems clear that Brooks was not going to be able to harm anyone with her car at a moment ’s notice .
Nonetheless , some threat she might retrieve the keys and drive off erratically remained , particularly given her refusal to leave the car and her state of agitation . ”
Note , she was arrested after going 32 mph .
Judge Berzon wrote a lengthy and well - reasoned dissent , noting :
The stacked - up , unsubstantiated speculations that Brooks might have been able to retrieve the keys and might have decided to drive off ( although she did not when she had the keys ) and might have driven erratically if she did drive off and might have endangered people had she done so simply wo n’t do as a basis for believing Brooks posed a danger to someone .
Indeed , if Officer Ornelas really believed she was going to take off and endanger people , all he had to do was hold on to the keys rather than drop them in the car .
Here is the opinion : Taser

James Connolly
Sinn Féin And Socialism
( 1908 )
The Harp , April 1908 .
Republished in James Connolly : Selected Political Writings , ( ed. Owen Dudley Edwards & Bernard Ransom ) , New York 1974 .
Transcription & HTML Mark - up : Einde O’Callaghan for the Marxists ’ Internet Archive .
Sinn Féin .
That is a good name for the new Irish movement of which we hear so much nowadays .
Sinn Féin , or in English , Ourselves .
It is a good name and a good motto .
The first essential for the success of any party , or of any movement , is that it should believe it carries within its own bosom all the material requisite to achieve its destiny .
The moment any organization ceases to believe in the sufficiency of its own powers , the moment its membership begin to put their trust in powers not their own , in that moment that party or that organization enters on its decline .
It has been so with Ireland , it is so with the non-Socialist Working Class .
For over a hundred years Ireland has looked outside her own shores for the means of her redemption .
For over a hundred years Ireland through her ‘ constitutional agitators ’ has centered her hopes upon the possibility of melting the heart or appealing to the sense of justice of her oppressors .
In vain !
England – the British Empire , was and is the bourgeoisie personified , the incarnate beast of capitalist property , and her heart was as tender as that of the tiger when he feels his victim helpless in his claws ; her sense of justice was as acute as that of the same beast of prey when his jaws are wet with the warm blood of the feast .
For over a hundred years the majority of the Irish people begged for justice , and when ever and anon the hot blood of the best of her children would rise in rebellion at this mendicant posture Ireland turned her face from them and asked the enemy to forgive them .
When her rebel sons and daughters were dead , hunted , imprisoned , hanged or exiled she would weep for them , pray for them , sigh for them , cry for them , and when they were long enough out of the way , erect monuments to them .
But as long as they were virile , active and aggressive , Ireland regarded them only as disturbers who gave the country a bad name .
Not that Ireland was or is alone in that respect .
To be execrated when living and deified when dead has been the experience of all champions of Freedom in all the countries and ages of the earth .
This attitude , whether it is exhibited by an oppressed nation or by an oppressed class , is the direct outcome of that frame of mind in either which teaches them to look outside their own ranks for the impulse towards emancipation .
To believe that someone else than the slave is going to free the slave makes the slave impatient and intolerant of every effort at self - liberation on the part of his fellow bondsmen .
Now the course of action implied in the name Sinn Féin , is the reverse of all that .
It teaches the Irish people to rely upon themselves , and upon themselves alone , and teaches them also that dependence upon forces outside themselves is emasculating in its tendency , and has been , and will ever be disastrous in its results .
So far , so good .
That is a part of Sinn Féinism I am most heartily in agreement with , and indeed with the spirit of Sinn Féin every thinking Irishman who knows anything about the history of his country must concur .
Even on the question of the Irish language , Gaelic , a question on which most Socialists are prone to stumble , I am heartily in accord .
I do believe in the necessity , and indeed in the inevitability , of a universal language , but I do not believe it will be brought about , or even hastened , by smaller races or nations consenting to the extinction of their language .
Such a course of action , or rather of slavish inaction , would not hasten the day of a universal language , but would rather lead to the intensification of the struggle for mastery between the languages of the greater powers .
On the other hand a large number of small communities speaking different tongues , are more likely to agree upon a common language as a common means of communication than a small number of great empires , each jealous of its own power and seeking its own supremacy .
I have heard some doctrinaire Socialists arguing that Socialists should not sympathize with oppressed nationalities , or with nationalities resisting conquest .
They argue that the sooner these nationalities are suppressed the better , as it will be easier to conquer political power in a few big empires than in a number of small states .
This is the language argument over again .
It is fallacious in both cases .
It is even more fallacious in the case of nationalities than in the case of languages , because the emancipation of the Working Class will function more through the economic power than through the political state .
The first act of the workers will be through their economic organizations seizing the organized industries ; the last act the conquest of political power .
In this the working class will , as they needs must , follow in the lines traversed by the capitalist revolutions of Cromwellian England , of Colonial and Revolutionary America , of Republican France , in each of whom the capitalist class had developed their economic power before they raised the banner of political revolt .
The Working Class in their turn must perfect their economic organizations , and when such organizations are in a position to control , seize and operate the industries they will find their political power equal to the task .
But the preparatory work of the revolutionary campaign must lie in the daily and hourly struggles in the workshop , the daily and hourly perfectioning of the industrial organization .
And these two factors for Freedom take no heed to political frontiers , nor to the demarcations of political states .
They march side by side with the capitalist ; where capitalism brings its machinery it brings the rebels against itself , and all its governments and all its armies can establish no frontier the revolutionary idea cannot pass .
Let the great truth be firmly fixed in your mind that the struggle for the conquest of the political state of the capitalist is not the battle , it is only the echo of the battle .
The real battle is being fought out , and will be fought out , on the industrial field .
Because of this and other reasons the doctrinaire Socialists are wrong in this as in the rest of their arguments .
It is not necessary that Irish Socialists should hostilise those who are working for the Gaelic language , nor whoop it up for territorial aggrandizement of any nation .
Therefore in this we can wish the Sinn Féiners , good luck .
Besides , it is well to remember that nations which submit to conquest or races which abandon their language in favor of that of an oppressor do so , not because of altruistic motives , or because of a love of the brotherhood of man , but from a slavish and cringing spirit .
From a spirit which cannot exist side by side with the revolutionary idea .
This was amply evidenced in Ireland by the attitude of the Irish people towards their language .
For six hundred years the English strove to suppress that mark of the distinct character of the Gael – their language , and failed .
But in one generation the politicians did what England had failed to do .
The great Daniel O’Connell , the so - called liberator , conducted his meetings entirely in English .
When addressing meetings in Connaught where in his time everybody spoke Gaelic , and over 75 per cent of the people nothing else but Gaelic , O’Connell spoke exclusively in English .
He thus conveyed to the simple people the impression that Gaelic was something to be ashamed of – something fit only for ignorant people .
He pursued the same course all over Ireland .
As a result of this and similar actions the simple people turned their backs upon their own language , and began to ape ‘ the gentry ’ .
It was the beginning of the reign of the toady , and the crawler , the seáinín and the slave .
The agitator for revenue came into power in the land .
It is not ancient history , but the history of yesterday that old Irish men and women would speak Irish to each other in the presence of their children , but if they caught son or daughter using the language the unfortunate child would receive a cuff on the ear accompanied with the adjuration :
“ Speak English , you rascal ; speak English like a gintleman ! ”
It is freely stated in Ireland that when the Protestant evangelizers , soupers they call them at home , issued tracts and Bibles in Irish in order to help the work of proselytizing , the Catholic priesthood took advantage of the incident to warn their flocks against reading all literature in Gaelic .
Thus still further discrediting the language .
I can not conceive of a Socialist hesitating in his choice between a policy resulting in such self - abasement , and a policy of defiant self - reliance , and confident trust in a people ’s own power of self - emancipation by a people .
But it is in many of the arguments used by the Sinn Féin speakers that the possibility , nay , the certainty of friction between the Irish Socialist and the adherents of Sinn Féin is likely to arise .
Some of the arguments are as ridiculous as the principle itself is reasonable .
Thus the Sinn Féin body of the Argentine Republic , as recorded in the Gaelic American , states that Sinn Féin demands freedom for Ireland on the basis of the Act of Renunciation in 1782 .
This is absurd .
The act by which the English Parliament renounced the right to make laws binding on Ireland left untouched the power of oppression , political and economic .
The fight which ended with the Act of Union in i8 oo was not a fight for freedom , it was a fight to decide whether the English governing classes or the Irish governing classes should have the biggest share of the plunder of the Irish worker .
Whichever side won made no difference to the worker ; he was skinned , anyway .
As a cold matter of fact all talk about the “ restoration of our native Parliament ” is misreading history .
Ireland never had an Irish Parliament – a Parliament representative of the Irish people .
The assembly called by the name of an Irish Parliament was in reality as alien to the Irish people as the Council of the Governor - General of India is alien to the Indian people .
And some of the laws passed by our so - called native Parliament against the poor Irish peasantry were absolutely revolting in their ferocity and class vindictiveness .
Irish workers will not enthuse worth a cent over a proposal to re-introduce the status of 1782 .
To paraphrase Fintan Lalor , and I would recommend all thinking Irish workers , men and women , to read Fintan Lalor ’s masterly argument upon this subject , ( price five cents , from the Harp office ) .
“ This is not 1782 , this is 1908 , ” and every political or social movement which hopes for success must express itself in terms of present conditions , or on the lines of future developments .
Of a like character are the arguments based upon the achievement of Hungary .
As we all know the methods adopted by Hungary to reconquer its Parliament from Austria are the trite illustrations of the Sinn Féin orators .
In fact during the early stages of the movement in Ireland before the felicitous name of Sinn Féin was coined the ideas as promulgated got the name of ‘ the Hungary system ’ .
I remember one critic declaring that “ the Hungary system was only fit for hungry men . ”
When we remember that Hungary is one of the European countries sending the greatest stream of emigrants annually to America , that the overwhelming majority of the producing classes in Hungary are denied the right to vote by the possessing classes who dominate their Parliament , that the misery of the town and country workers is so great that the country is in a chronic state of rebellion and unrest , and that the military and armed police are more often employed to suppress peaceable demonstrations in Hungary than they are in Ireland we are inclined to wonder if our Sinn Féin orators know these things , or are they only presuming upon the ignorance of the Irish Workers .
Let them advocate their proposals upon the inherent merits of those proposals and they will avoid much criticism ; otherwise they will provoke it .
Sinn Féin .
Ourselves .
I wonder how long it will be until the Working Class realize the full significance of that principle !
How long it will be until the Workers realize that the Socialist movement is a movement of the Working Class , and how long until the Socialists realize that the place of every other class in the movement is and must be a subordinate one .
How long it will be until the Socialists realize the folly and inconsistency of preaching to the Workers that the emancipation of the Working Class must be the act of the workers themselves , and yet presenting to those workers the sight of every important position in the party occupied by men not of the Working Class .
We will get the Workers to have trust in their own power to achieve their own emancipation when we demonstrate our belief that there is no task incidental to that end that a worker can not accomplish ; when we train the workers to look inward upon their own class for everything required , to have confidence in the ability of their own class to fill every position in the revolutionary army ; when , in short , we of the Socialist Working Class take to heart the full meaning of the term Sinn Féin , Ourselves , and apply it to the work of Industrial Reconstruction , the era of the strutters and poseurs will end and we will realize at last what was meant by Marx when he spoke of the revolt of those who
Have Nothing to Lose but their Chains .

‘ Film is a visual medium ’ .
So goes the screenwriter ’s favourite truism .
And hence the most sublime joy of reading screenplays : the language of scene action .
I ’m not denying the pleasures of the cinematic experience for one moment .
But the literary pleasures to be had from reading well - written scene action can be extremely powerful – and yet are largely overlooked .
As with prose fiction , approaches to scene action fall into different ‘ schools ’ .
There are the ‘ Purists ’ , worshipping at the altar of clear sentences and precisely chosen images .
‘ Show , do n’t tell , ’ they chant to themselves as they tap away in Final Draft .
As the script ‘ guru ’ Billy Mernit put it last year in his blog , the conventional approach to scene action pushes the writer not to ‘ over - explain ’ or ‘ pre- direct ’ the story events he or she is trying to depict .
‘ Be clear , be precise … your prose should be as spare and smart as a Raymond Carver story . ’
This advice has a lot to recommend it .
But Mernit acknowledged that some successful screenwriters also break this cardinal rule , citing the scripts for Oscar - winners Milk and Slumdog Millionaire – and this is where variations on the Purists ’ method can produce exciting literary experiences .
For instance , there are the screenplay equivalents of the Beats , proponents of an anarchic brand of stream - of - consciousness that releases the story on to the page one manic fragment at a time .
From the first draft of Bad Lieutenant by Abel Ferrara and Zoe Lund :
LT leaps up .
He ’s on a manic roll .
Conceives an insanely captivating , impossible idea .
As he speaks , he speeds more and more until he seems to be reciting a rapid - fire tongue twister perfect .
The broken grammar and gathering momentum of the language is ideal for portraying a scene where our anti-hero , the Lieutenant of the title , is blitzed on an intravenous cocktail of heroin and cocaine with the bad guys steadily closing in around him .
Conversely , in the opening pages of The Big Lebowski ( Ethan and Joel Cohen ) , we find a completely different kind of rhythm to enjoy :
It is late , the supermarket all but deserted .
We are tracking in on a fortyish man in Bermuda shorts and sunglasses at the dairy case .
He is the Dude .
His rumpled look and relaxed manner suggest a man in whom casualness runs deep .
This kind of effortless precision is thrilling to read .
What could be more suited to conveying the meticulously idle drift of El Duderino ( ‘ I ’m not into the whole brevity thing ’ ) than the rolling Rs of ‘ rumpled ’ , ‘ relaxed ’ and ‘ runs ’ ?
The grammatically pedantic but rhythmically gentle ‘ in whom casualness runs deep ’ serves the same purpose .
Talking of The Big Lebowski , the wider world of screenwriting contains its own Nihilists .
Andrew Kevin Walker ’s script for Seven unsurprisingly presents a grisly catalogue of dystopian images .
Even the rare flashes of beauty in the script are quickly tainted with corruption and death .
INT .
SOMERSET’S APARTMENT – MORNING
Somerset picks items off a moving box : his keys , wallet , switchblade , gold homicide badge .
Finally , he opens the hardcover book he had with him on the train .
From the pages , he takes the pale , paper rose .
INT .
TENEMENT APARTMENT – DAY
Somerset stands before a wall which is stained by a star - burst of blood .
A body lies on the floor under a sheet .
A sawed - off shotgun lies not far from the body .
Later in the script , we are given such percussive treats as
Crack vials and hypodermic needles on the stairs crunch under the cops ’ heavy boots .
A variation on the Nihilist approach might be the Minimalist approach .
Consider this moment from the opening page of Alien by Dan O’Bannon :
FADE IN
SOMETIME IN THE FUTURE :
INT .
ENGINE ROOM
Empty , cavernous .
INT .
ENGINE CUBICLE
Circular , jammed with instruments .
All of them idle .
Console chairs for two .
Empty .
INT .
OILY CORRIDOR – “ C ” LEVEL
Long , dark .
Empty .
Turbos throbbing .
No other movement .
In a conventional ‘ earthbound ’ storyline , the scene heading – e.g. INT .
ENGINE CUBICLE – would need to include an indication of the time of day .
Not so in this piece .
We ’re in deep space , the disorientation of an endless night , our sensory palette reduced to a hollow , haunting hum .
Luckily for readers with more Romantic tastes , it ’s not all doom and gloom .
Consider the poise of the opening lines of Anthony Minghella ’s The English Patient and ask whether they would seem out of place at the start of a literary novel :
SILENCE .
THE DESERT seen from the air .
An ocean of dunes for mile after mile .
The late sun turns the sand every color from crimson to black .
Even the Postmodernists get a look in .
Perhaps my favourite screenplay is Shane Black ’s notorious script for Lethal Weapon ; notorious because it earned him \ $ 250,000 , an extremely large sum at the time for an unknown writer ; notorious because no one writes quite like Mr. Black .
EXT .
POSH BEVERLY HILLS HOME – TWILIGHT
The kind of house that I ’ll buy if this movie is a huge hit .
Chrome .
Glass .
Carved wood .
Plus an outdoor solarium : a glass structure , like a greenhouse only there ’s a big swimming pool inside .
This is a really great place to have sex .
Lethal Weapon .
A metafictional masterpiece .
Who knew ?
The postmodern flourishes proliferate throughout the script :
The General laughs .
Rianne shrieks .
Harrowing .
Terrible .
A scene out of Hell .
And then the Devil comes in and kicks the door off its hinges .
Okay .
Okay .
Let ’s stop for a moment .
First off , to describe fully the mayhem which Riggs now creates would not do it justice .
Here , however , are a few pointers :
He is not flashy .
He is not Chuck Norris .
Rather , he is like a sledge - hammer hitting an egg .
He does not knock people down .
He does not injure them .
He simply kills them .
The whole room .
Everyone standing .
‘ Audiences do n’t know somebody sits down and writes a picture , ’ observes Sunset Blvd .
protagonist , struggling screenwriter Joe Gillis – ‘ they think the actors make it up as they go along . ’
Sixty or so years later , it ’s probably even easier to find oneself entranced by the latest impeccably produced offering and forget that a writer had to sit down at a desk hour after repetitive hour and write the damn thing one word at a time .
Perhaps we should n’t be surprised that the screenwriter ’s art is an unseen one .
‘ The challenge of screenwriting , ’ Raymond Chandler proposed , ‘is to say much in little and then take half of that little out and still preserve an effect of leisure and natural movement . ’
The next time you ’re sitting in that cinema seat , letting the enchanting ‘ effect of leisure and natural movement ’ wash over you twenty - four times per second , you might want to remember Joe Gillis and his unread poetry .

The Trouble with Ruby Finalizers
2010-02-24
I was test driving Devil , the developer ’s image library , recently to see if it would work for us in a long - living daemon .
Task # 1 to that end is to verify the absence of memory leaks , which seem to be common in image libraries .
It was almost immediately apparent that Devil contained a large memory leak .
So I worked with John Mair to fix the issue .
Devil has a Devil : : Image class which uses a finalizer to delete native resources when the image is garbage collected .
The problem is that Ruby finalizers are notoriously difficult to use properly so often times they are n’t actually run .
Here ’s why :
class Devil :: Image attr_reader : name , : file def initialize ( name , file ) @name = name @file = file ObjectSpace.define_finalizer ( self , proc { IL.DeleteImages ( 1 , [ name ] ) } ) end end
So what ’s wrong with this code ?
The issue is that the finalizer proc is a closure which holds a reference to it ’s self , thus making it impossible for the image object to ever be garbage collected .
When creating a finalizer proc , you should always use a class method to create the proc so that it does not hold a reference to the corresponding instance , like so :
def initialize ( name , file ) @name = name @file = file ObjectSpace.define_finalizer ( self , self.class.finalize( name ) ) end def self.finalize ( name ) proc { IL.DeleteImages ( 1 , [ name ] ) } end
A subtle and evil bug , just like its namesake !
A short sample excerpt of the trumpet recorded for the song ' Bittersweet Sleep '
Thanks to a lazy Google image search , a leading Polish newspaper erroneously claimed that despicable Internet meme Pedobear was one of the mascots of the 2010 Vancouver Olympics .
But that ’s not the first time the pervy bear has fooled the gatekeepers of reality and made its way into the real world :
1. Vancouver 2010 Olympic Mascot ?
Some more background on the Vancouver debacle : some months ago , artist Michael R. Barrick ‘ Shopped Pedobear into a picture of the 2010 Olympic mascots .
Thereafter , the image he created became one of the tops in Google Image Search ; mayhem ensued .
And the Polish paper was n’t the only one fooled : Barrick : “ So the Gazeta Olsztyn ‘s epic fail in publishing my simple critique of the unfortunate resemblance of the Vancouver 2010 Olympic Mascots ( Quatchi in particular ) to Pedobear was yesterday ’s news .
Despite the fact that it is now being LOL ’d at all over the Intertubesand has been documented in Encyclopædia Dramatica , and the link I have to Know Your Memes explaining just what Pedobear is , today we now have a Spanish sports blog presenting the image again . ”
2. Pat Buchanan pairs Pedobear with Obama
A column that conservative commentator Pat Buchanan wrote in July about the early months of Barack Obama ‘s presidency got plenty of attention even from normally politically disengaged bloggy types , and not because of the prose .
Wonkette : “ it seems possible that whoever decided to combine Pat Buchanan ’s Nixon column with a picture of Pedobear did not fully understand what that little cartoon character is really “ about . ”
3. iStockphoto stocks Pedobear seamless wrapping paper
Malevolent creatures graphically representing every possible permutation of the shady bear is n’t particularly noteworthy ; their creations being approved by a major , for - profit Getty Images subsidiary is .
The wrapping paper has ( fortunately ) since been taken down , but a NeoGAF forum thread preserves it in all its ignominy .
4. Pedobear on Portland costume store flyer ( no image available )
A costume store in Portland accidentally put out a flyer bearing a Pedobear - like ursine figure .
This would have been bad enough , but a local news station picked up on the story , excruciatingly ran mainstream audiences through a brief Pedobear history ( the video has since been pulled ) , and even interviewed Cheezburger Network CEO Ben Huh about Pedobear ’s cultural significance .
Self - fulfilling prophecies , anyone ?
5. Pedobear graces the cover of Import Tuner magazine ( via NeoGAF ; click image to see it fully sized )
This may be yet another fan ( ? ) - made Pedobear tribute , but it graced (? ) the covers of an 89,000 + circulation auto magazine :
In a front cover clearly meant to highlight the merits of a drift - ready Scion , and also possibly a hot babe , you will find an unwelcome (? ) guest spectating in the stands .
Some rogue cover designer probably got a stern talking - to for this , though it is probably not that hard to make the most controversial cover of Import Tuner ever .
Related : Know Your Meme has a comprehensive history of the Pedobear meme , from 2 chan ’s innocent “ Safety Bear ” to 4 chan ’s Chris Hansen - hounded scourge .

Epic have just released this amazing tech demo for the upcoming Gears of War 3 .
A lot of information is still in the air and we have no clue as to when the third game in the premium franchise will be released .
At GDC , Epic showed various demonstrations of their updated Unreal Engine .
One of those was the tech demo for Gears of War 3 .
The video is pretty short but it shows the level of detail that one can expect from a Gears of War game .
The footage shows a Brumak roaring through a jungle .
You can check the video yourself below :
Also as reported by Kotaku , Epic Games vice president Mark Rein , referring to a demo showing a blob of liquid metal , asked the audience at GDC : “ Remember last year we had the meat cube ?
… This is the mercury cube ”
Another demo showed what the updated Unreal Engine was really capable of .
An Epic representative playing a demo , quickly zipped through a city , indicating how quickly the buidlings and the huge city can be easily rendered by the engine .
Mark Rein added : “ One day we ’ll show you what we ’re doing with this .
When you see what we ’re doing with this , it ’s going to blow your mind . ”
Here are some of the images that have been rendered in real time using the engine .

Between a massive reunion tour and a new studio album to an appearance at Bonnaroo and the hosting of its very own music festival , Phish seemingly did it all in 2009 .
Well , that is everything except star in its very own feature film .
However , that will all change later this year when the legendary jam band follows in the footstep of U2 and Dave Matthews Band and releases its very own 3D film .
According to a source with knowledge of the project , the film , which consists of footage from the band ’s Phish Festival 8 last October , will hit theaters this April .
This weekend , the band officially began to tease the project with a 15 - second trailer proceeding all some Alice in Wonderland 3D screenings .
A more extensive trailer is expected to be released next month .
An official website , Twitter , and Facebook page have also been launched .
While exacts specifics regarding the film ’s content remain unclear , a Hidden Track post last October , written following a firsthand preview of video footage , offers some insight on what to expect :
Very cool technology , he [ a VP at AEG ] said they re shooting all eight sets in 3D and are hoping to have some sort of theatrical release in April or May of 2010 .
Same video crew for future 3D work and the images on the screens at the show .
But yeah , the couple tunes we watched was very well done especially the shots taken from the side of the stage when theres objects like saxophones on stands in the foreground …
Visually , the lights on the palm trees are something else , very nicely done .
The video screens are very large , very bright , and very clear .
If you are situated anywhere in front of the SBD it feels like you re already watching Phish at the movies  as most peoples eyes are set on the screens and not the stage as a whole like you normally see .
More details as they are announced .
Fans hoping to see the film ’s teaser without throwing down cash for Alice in Wonderland can expect to see it on the film ’s aforementioned website next week .
Sarah Palin made her " comedy debut " on The Tonight Show .
( Apparently the running joke of her candidacy does n't count .
Ba-dum - ching !)
This allowed us to witness a pair of millionaires chuckling on a Hollywood stage about how they are bloggers ' victims .
Asked about media criticism of her family , Palin brought up Family Guy and complained that mainstream media did n't provide adequate platforms for her to attack the show .
( Recall that she is already a career talking head and capable of commanding interviews in any newspaper , TV show , or radio program in America .
The only bigger platform would be to attach a megaphone to the moon and blanket the entire planet with her voice . )
She leans in and tells Jay he knows what it 's like to get made fun of after " these last weeks . "
He cuts to commercial .
Then , to improve that pesky " no platform " problem , Leno invites Palin to audition for his job by performing a mock monologue .
The funniest joke came before she started , when Palin said she would forgo cue cards because she knew her jokes " like the front of my hand . "
The monologue consisted of weird political metaphors and gee - shucks moments about eating moose .
At the end , she throws in another chuckle about how Jay is her brother in media martyrdom .
Irate about blog chatter and convinced that the antidotes are Fox News and Jay Leno — is it possible Palin just does n't know what " mainstream media " means ?
More clips from Palin's Leno appearance at Gawker .TV
Fourteen , 15 and , for now , 16 : the Russian top flight looks as though it will kick off this weekend with the full complement of teams , but it 's as well to keep checking as the financial winter bites .
The battle at the top is likely to be between the usual suspects of Rubin Kazan , CSKA Moscow , Spartak Moscow and Zenit St Petersburg , but the real battle may be simply one of survival .
The Russian football boom was largely financed by the boom in Russian natural resources , and that is in retreat .
GDP fell in 2009 after years of stellar growth , and the impact is already being felt in football , with FK Moskva folding last month after NorNikel withdrew their sponsorship .
That completed the shameful collapse of Torpedo Moscow of which FK Moskva was once a splinter .
Even as the conspiracy theorists suggested it was all part of a plot to get Alania Vladikavkaz back into the top flight ( and so appease one of Russia 's more troubled regions , runs the logic , even though the Caucasus already had three representatives in the top flight ) , it also served as a warning to others .
The general perception may be that English football is unsustainable , but compared to Russia it seems comfortingly robust .
The Russian top flight as a whole generates only $ 24 m ( £ 16 m ) a year in television rights , while with attendances averaging only around 12,000 , income from gate receipts – and thus merchandising and advertising – is tiny .
Almost every club is dependent on a patron , usually a commodities company backed by an oligarch ( FK Moskva 's future was first cast in doubt in February 2007 when Mikhail Prokhorov , a keen football fan and now Russia 's richest man , left NorNikel , intent on separating his assets from those of his long - time partner Vladimir Potanin ) , the local government or some combination of the two .
The regional government of Tatarstan continues to back Rubin , Zenit are sponsored by Gazprom , Spartak by Lukoil , and CSKA have just struck a deal with the mid-sized oil company Bashneft for an undisclosed fee , but Shafir Galeyev of Deloitte said he believes that every Russian club posted an operational loss last season , although there is no possibility of performing a full audit .
After FK Moskva , there was a serious possibility that Krylya Sovetov might have gone out of business before the season began .
They reportedly owe $ 80 m to various creditors , including Roman Abramovich , who loaned the club $ 5.4 m several years ago , although it is not thought that he is making urgent demands to recover the money .
As late as a fortnight ago , players had not been paid their bonuses since August , part of $ 15 m believed to be owed to the squad , while the coach Yuri Gazzaev – the cousin of the Dynamo Kyiv coach Valeri – had not been paid at all .
The squad are now threatening to boycott their opening game this weekend unless the bonuses are paid .
With creditors pressing , the Russian prime minister Vladimir Putin ordered Igor Sechin , his deputy with responsibility for the oil and gas industries , and Sergei Chemezov , head of Russian Technologies , who sponsor Krylya , to find a way of ensuring the club survived .
Putin similarly used what is euphemistically known as his " administrative resource " to save Tom Tomsk last season .
Sechin has said that Krylya require a yearly budget of up to $ 30 m .
It is not yet clear which companies will be asked to contribute , but last year Tom were saved by a combination of Rosneft , the largest oil company in Russia , Gazprom Neft , which used to be Sibneft , and others .
Last year 's champions Rubin Kazan , who begin against Yuri Semin 's Lokomotiv on Sunday , have lost arguably their best player of last season , the Argentinian forward Alejandro Domínguez , who returned to Zenit after the completion of his loan spell and was sold to Valencia .
They have a coherent method , though , and will hope that Fatih Tekke , brought in from Zenit , can replicate his sparkle .
The Turkish forward is one of six winter signings , including the Spanish defender Jordi Figueras , from Celta Vigo , and the Israel international midfielder Bebars Natcho , who played in both legs of the Europa League last - 32 game for Hapoel Tel Aviv against Rubin last month .
Rubin , who were more expansive last season than they had been in securing their first title success a year before , were back to their cagey best on Sunday , beating CSKA 1 - 0 with a fine defensive display an Alexander Bukharov goal to lift the Super Cup .
Repeated changes of management undermined CSKA last season , and it was only when Leonid Slutsky replaced Juande Ramos , who had himself replaced Zico , that they achieved any measure of stability .
That was enough to carry them into the last 16 of the Champions League , and their chances in the league are to an extent conditioned by how much of a distraction that proves .
The arrival of the Japanese forward Keisuke Honda is intriguing , but it is hard to believe they will not miss the explosive striking talents of Vagner Love .
The attacking midfielder Alan Dzagoev remains one of the most exciting prospects in world football , but there are major problems at the back where , at 30 , Sergei Ignashevich is showing signs of age and the constant strain of playing alongside the increasingly hapless Vasili Berezutsky .
They get the season under way on Friday at home to Amkar Perm .
Spartak , after a difficult start to last season , improved dramatically as Valeri Karpin trusted in youth , although it remains to be seen whether they are sufficiently battle - hardened to mount a real challenge .
Alex is a creator of genuine quality , while Welliton was the league 's top scorer last season .
and they will be complemented in the forward line by a third Brazilian , Ari , signed from AZ Alkmaar .
The Montenegrin centre - back Nikola Drincic , hailed as the new Nemanja Vidic , has also arrived from Amkar , but a broken leg sustained in pre-season is likely to keep him out until August .
Zenit , meanwhile , must be hoping that their long and uneasy transition after winning the Uefa Cup in 2008 is over .
They have continued their policy of foreign coaches with the appointment of Luciano Spalletti , who pioneered strikerlessness at Roma , and have made four winter signings , all of them of sufficiently proven quality to suggest the transfer gambling that so enraged Dick Advocaat is over .
Four years after he left for Sevilla , the forward Alexander Kerzhakov has returned from Dinamo , with the international midfielder Igor Semshov moving in the opposite direction , and he is joined by the Serbian forward Danko Lazovic from PSV , the Belarusian goalkeeper Yuri Zhevnov from FK Moskva and the 22 - year - old Denmark full - back Michael Lumb from AGF .
Whatever happens in the title race , though , the greatest success for Russian football might be reaching November with 16 top - flight clubs .
PLANTING nut trees and salvaging old frying fat to make biodiesel are among ideas devised by communities across Britain competing for government money to fight climate change .
Twenty - two struck lucky .
Over the past two months the Department of Energy and Climate Change ( DECC ) has given these winners of the Low Carbon Community Challenge ( LCCC ) grants of up to £ 500,000 ( $ 780,000 ) .
Most of the projects involve small communities of 1,000 to 3,000 people planning a mix of measures such as new hydro - , wind , solar and biomass power ; home insulation ; electric transport and growing their own food .
This may seem small beer given Britain 's target of an 80 % cut in greenhouse - gas emissions by 2050 .
But by letting a thousand flowers bloom , DECC wants to understand “ what is and is n't working … on the ground , ” said Joan Ruddock , minister for energy and climate change , on February 8th .
Many local councils have appointed climate - change officials .
A plethora of foundations offer advice and support .
But there is nothing like a bit of competition to stiffen sinews .
DECC is seizing a moment which may be brief .
It announced the challenge in July , awarded the first ten grants in December and another 12 on February 4th .
Why the hurry ?
DECC was stitched together from the Department for Business and the Department for the Environment , Food and Rural Affairs late in 2008 and needs to make its mark soon .
Moreover , an election looms , which may see Ms Ruddock and her boss , Ed Miliband , thrown out of office .
Most important , perhaps , the programme will coincide with the birth of electricity feed - in tariffs on April 1st .
Small electricity providers with up to 5MW capacity will be able to sell their excess power to the grid at a subsidised premium .
Many of the LCCC projects depend on getting repaid through such sales .
Ministers hope the new tariffs will create up to 750,000 micro-power installations by 2020 .
( That may be overly optimistic : in Germany , where feed - in tariffs began in 2000 , there were just 290,000 micro-power installations by the end of 2006 . )
The question is whether these measures will make much difference .
A study by the Royal Academy of Engineering suggests that small wind turbines are not cost - effective and that insulating homes is a better use of money .
One LCCC project includes building 30 German - inspired Passiv houses , which require less than 15kWh per square metre per year to heat ( a standard house uses 55kWh ) .
Fortunately for those that missed out on the latest handouts , there are other sources of cash .
The South West has grand ambitions to make itself a renewable - energy powerhouse .
Its Regional Development Agency ( with some assistance from Europe ) has financed the Wave Hub project in Cornwall , which will feed power from numerous offshore wave - power machines into the grid .
Russell Geake at Community Energy Plus , a charity , thinks the county could save £ 260 m a year on its energy bills .
The White Book of Capitalism & Democracy
As a response to the damning Black Book of Communism , some recalcitrant Marxists have begun compiling what they believe are the crimes of capitalism .
They call it the White Book .
Here are some capitalist - pig crimes they cite :
( 1962-1996 ) The Guatamalean government , along with the United States government which played a major role of support , committed genocide and terrorism resulting in the systematic torture and murder of 200,000 people .
200,000 people .
( 1975 -1999 )
In the Republic of Indonesia , 200,000 East - Timorese were massacred in a campaign of genocide spanning several decades .
A whole section on U.S. military history and nuclear proliferation , with sections on environmental destruction , poverty , and union busting to come .
After two minutes of reading this mess , it will dawn on you that all of the crimes they cite are crimes committed by nation - states .
They say nothing about how markets relate to any of this .
Very peculiar .
Take away the words market and capitalism from their website , and it reads like a fairly orthodox criticism of state power .
Cyber attacks against Australia have increased in frequency in recent months , Defence Minister Linda Reynolds said on Friday , as the country released its first ...
Energy rationing across Venezuela was announced last month
President Hugo Chavez has added three days to Venezuela 's Easter holiday to deal with a growing energy crisis .
The move - which will close government and public offices - means most Venezuelans will have a seven - day break starting on 1 April .
Mr Chavez said the aim of the measure was not to encourage " laziness , but to save energy " .
Caracas says a drought has dropped water reserves at Venezuela 's main hydroelectric dam to critical levels .
The opposition says lack of investment and inefficiency in the energy sector have contributed to the crisis .
President Chavez says his critics are exaggerating the crisis
Many business leaders have warned that industrial production could be disrupted .
Mr Chavez rejects these claims , accusing his critics of exaggerating the crisis - or even planning to sabotage the power grid ahead of parliamentary elections planned in September .
The president last month signed a decree declaring an " electricity emergency " to tackle power shortages .
Under the decree , energy users who consume more than 500 kilowatt - hours per month must reduce their consumption by at least 10 % or face a 75 % price rise .
Industrial users were also ordered to cut their usage by 20 % or face sanctions .
Although Venezuela has big oil reserves , it is dependent on hydro - electricity for some 70 % of its power .
Module :: Install exists because installing CPAN distributions is not always perfectly easy .
Unfortunately , it did n't help — at least , not entirely .
According to the completely unscientific process by which I install CPAN distributions , Module : : Install accounts for a greater amount of pain than it should , at least according to its frequency of use .
( Again , this is completely unscientific .
I could guess that half of the CPAN client sessions which encounter Module : : Install require me to fix things manually , but it 's probably closer to 20 % .
It 's more memorable because of my severe dislike for M:: I prompting to install dependencies during configuration time . )
M:: I addresses a real bootstrapping problem .
I want to be able to use libraries during configuration , building , testing , and installation .
I do n't know which versions of those libraries you have available .
Bundling known - good versions of those libraries with the distribution itself solves part of that problem ...
... except when it does n't .
If I were to use M: : I , I would have to re-release all of my distributions for every new release of every bundled library , at least if they contain important bug fixes for the various platforms about which I care .
The cheap perfume of static linking leaves its musk heavy in the air .
It 's easy to fall into the trap of a false dilemma .
" You fool ! " you prepare to comment below .
" It 's either that or the chaos of trying to make do with whatever version of those dependencies users may or may not have installed on their systems ! "
You 're right ; those are two possibilities .
They 're not the only two possibilities .
Part of the real problem is that bootstrapping during configuration is much too late .
By the time you 're running the configuration system , you 're already running the configuration system .
If your version of the configuration system is too old or too new , you have a problem .
Bail out ?
Revert ?
Upgrade ?
There 's no good heuristic for determining this .
( The CPAN itself has an opinion .
That 's part of the problem . )
M:: I hackers do deserve credit for helping to develop the META . yml standard .
( I think M: : I is the wrong approach , but I intend no slight toward its users , advocates , and developers .
Invention requires the courage to get things wrong sometimes , even as it requires the courage to abandon false leads . )
The META . yml specification is a big step in the right direction .
If most CPAN modules have static requirements and follow a standard set of conventions , there 's little or no configuration necessary .
A sufficiently smart CPAN client can perform the appropriate configuration without running code from the distribution itself .
You can't avoid that in all cases ; distributions with XS components , for example , need to probe system information .
Good luck writing a sufficiently smart CPAN client and getting the community to agree on specific standards that let you find OpenGL headers in a cross - platform fashion , for example .
Yet if 80 % of CPAN distributions can get by with static , upload - time configuration , a lot of complexity of installation can go away .
Yes , that would make Module : : Build and ExtUtils : : MakeMaker unnecessary for ( probably ) most CPAN distributions , at least at the point of configuration , building , and installation .
( I 'm a recent fan of Dist : : Zilla for automating away tedium on behalf of distribution maintainers ; there 's less need for Module : : Install in such a world .
If I never write another Build .
PL again , so much the better . )
That helps , but the real problem with CPAN installations is that the CPAN itself is merely an uploading , indexing , and mirroring system .
Projects such as META. yml attempt to add ( and extract ) meaning from the system , but they cannot work around one fundamental design feature of the CPAN .
That limitation is the source of most woes for end users .
Clever readers ( or experienced CPAN users ) have already identified this limitation .
I 'll reveal it in the next installment .

Ed Miliband ’s adverts banned for overstating climate change
by Jonathan Leake , Environment Editor
TWO government advertisements that use nursery rhymes to warn people of the dangers of climate change have been banned by the Advertising Standards Authority ( ASA ) for exaggerating the potential harm .
The adverts , commissioned by Ed Miliband , the energy secretary , used the rhymes to suggest that Britain faces an inevitable increase in storms , floods and heat waves unless greenhouse gas emissions are brought under control .
The ASA has ruled that the claims made in the newspaper adverts were not supported by solid science and has told the Department of Energy and Climate Change ( DECC ) that they should not be published again .
It has also referred a television commercial to the broadcast regulator , Ofcom , for potentially breaching a prohibition on political advertising .
The rulings will be an embarrassment for Miliband , who has tried to portray his policies as firmly science - based .
He had commissioned two posters , four press advertisements and a short film for television and cinema , which started appearing in October last year in the run-up to the Copenhagen climate talks .
They attracted 939 complaints — more than the ASA received for any advertisement last year .
The deluge posed problems for the ASA , which is not a scientific body , so it decided to compare the text of Miliband ’s adverts with the reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) .
Based on that comparison , it ruled that two of the DECC ’s adverts had broken the advertising code on three counts : substantiation , truthfulness and environmental claims .
Of the two banned adverts , one depicted three men floating in a bathtub over a flooded British landscape , and the text read : “ Rub a dub dub , three men in a tub — a necessary course of action due to flash flooding caused by climate change . ”
It then explained : “ Climate change is happening .
Temperature and sea levels are rising .
Extreme weather events such as storms , floods and heat waves will become more frequent and intense .
If we carry on at this rate , life in 25 years could be very different . ”
The second showed two children peering into a stone well amid an arid , post - climate - change landscape .
It read : “ Jack and Jill went up the hill to fetch a pail of water .
There was none as extreme weather due to climate change had caused a drought . ”
It then added : “ Extreme weather conditions such as flooding , heat waves and storms will become more frequent and intense . ”
It was these additional claims , rather than the nursery rhymes or illustrations , that fell foul of the ASA , which ruled it was not scientifically possible to make such definitive statements about Britain ’s future climate .
The ASA said : “ All statements about future climate were based on modelled predictions , which the IPCC report itself stated still involved uncertainties in the magnitude and timing , as well as regional details , of predicted climate change . ”
It added that both predictions should have been phrased more tentatively .
The ASA did , however , reject other complaints , including one suggesting the DECC adverts were misleading because they presented human - induced climate change as a fact .
Miliband said : “ On the one issue where the ASA did not find in our favour , around one word in our print advertising , the science tells us that it is more than 90 % likely that there will be more extreme weather events if we do n’t act . ”
Greg Barker , shadow minister for climate change , said : “ It is so unnecessary to exaggerate the risks of global warming , and also counterproductive . ”

One baby lived .
The other died .
" Use my picture if it will help " said this mother .
The children are twins , the bottle - fed child is a girl who died the day after this photograph was taken by UNICEF in Islamabad , Pakistan .
Her brother was breastfed and thrived .
The mother was incorrectly told she could not breastfeed both children .
This horrific picture demonstrates the risk of artificial infant feeding , particularly where water supplies are unsafe .
The expense of formula can lead to parents over - diluting it to make it last longer or using unsuitable milk powders or animal milks .
In all countries breastfeeding provides immunity against infections .
Despite these risks the baby food industry aggressively markets breastmilk substitutes encouraging mothers and health workers to favour artifical infant feeding over breastfeeding .
Such tactics break marketing standards adopted by the World Health Assembly .
Nestlé , the world 's largest food company , is found to be responsible for more violations than any other company and is the target of an international boycott .
SCN News May 1991
This picture tells two stories : most obviously , about the often fatal consequences of bottle - feeding ; more profoundly , about the age - old bias in favour of the male .
The child with the bottle is a girl - she died the next day .
Her twin brother was breasfed .
This woman was told by her mother - in - law that she did n't have enough milk for both her children , and so she should breastfeed the boy .
But almost certainly she could have fed both her children herself , because the process of suckling induces the production of milk .
However , even if she found that she could not produce sufficient milk - unlikly as that would be - a much better alternative to bottle - feeding would have been to find a wet - nurse .
Ironically , this role has sometimes been taken by the grandmother .
In most cultures , before the advent of bottle - feeding , wet - nursing was commomn practice .
The Lesser Child
The photograph on the cover is horrifying .
Another baby girl dies unnecessarily .
The department of child development , Government of India , with assistance from UNICEF , has produced a compelling account of the plight of the ' Lesser child ' .
" In a culture that idolizes sons and dreads the birth of a daughter , to be born female comes perilously close of being born less than human .
Today the rejection of the unwanted girl can begin even before her birth : prenatal sex determination tests followed by quick abortions eliminate thousands of female foetuses before they can become daughters .
Those girls who manage to survive till birth and beyond find that the dice is heavily loaded against them in a world that denies them equal access to food , health , care , education , emmployment and simple human dignity .
" Born into indifference and reared on neglect , the girl child is caught in a web of cultural practices and prejudices that divest her of her individuality and mould her into a submissive self - sacrificing daughter and wife .
Her labour ensures the survival and well - being of her family but robs her not only of her childhood but also of her right to be free of hunger , ignorance , disease and poverty .
A baby dies every 30 seconds from unsafe bottle feeding .
One and a half million babies die every year in poor countries because they are not breastfed .

CLAYTON , Mich . — David B. Stone Sr. and his wife , Tina , made no secret about the fact that they were part of a militia , neighbors say .
The couple frequently let visitors in military fatigues erect tents in front of their trailer home at the intersection of rural dirt roads , and the sound of gunfire was routine .
“ In Michigan , I do n’t think it ’s that big of a deal to be in a militia , ” said Tom McDormett , a neighbor .
He added : “ They would practice shooting , but that ’s not a big deal .
People do that all the time out here . ”
But last Saturday night , Mr. McDormett watched through binoculars as the police raided the Stones ’ home , tearing off plywood from the base of their two connected single - wide trailers to search under the floors .
By Monday , the Stones were in green prison garb in a federal courthouse in Detroit , two of nine defendants facing sedition and weapons charges in connection with what Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. called an “ insidious plan . ”
Why no Male Studies ?
Lots of colleges have Women 's Studies departments .
Some pursue Gender Studies .
What about Men's Studies ?
I was just alerted to a web site that announces the following :
A gathering of academicians drawn from a range of disciplines will meet on April 7 , 2010 , at Wagner College , Staten Island , New York , to examine the declining state of the male , stemming from cataclysmic changes in today 's culture , environment and global economy .
At first I wondered if it was a joke .
Evidently it is not .
The colloquium will be led by Lionel Tiger , an anthropology professor at Rutgers University .
( Lionel Tiger ?
Wait , maybe it is a joke .
Oh , no , I guess not . )
It appears that a group of scholars want to open a serious discussion of the challenges facing men in today 's society -- inability to go to college being one -- as well as the phenomenon of misandry , the hatred of males , a term I confess I had not heard before today .
Women 's Studies departments seem to have arisen in the 1970s as part of a wave of feminism and feminist theory , with gender equity the underlying goal .
Men 's Studies ?
Well , the assumption has been that men are the group in power .
Most of what is studied in universities is , in essence , men 's studies .
The group promoting Male Studies suggests that there is need for a study of " the male human being , " and of such sub - topics as the deterioration of boys ' educational attainment , the prevalence of certain psychological disorders in boys and men and the " remarkable " rate of suicide among males , according to the web site .

While the debate over health care has at times bordered on the absurd , some opponents of the bills passed by the Democratic - led Congress have raised questions of fundamental importance to American democracy - namely , whether some of the proposals are constitutional .
While the arguments have hinged on a variety of components of the bills , the most oft - repeated concern relates to the individual mandate .
Because the individual mandate is part of all three health care proposals , those passed by the House and the Senate and the one proposed by President Barack Obama , this challenge is potentially the most serious .
As wrangling over the fate of health care reform continues , the CNN Fact Desk takes a look at the concern that a provision of the health care bill violate the governing document of the United States .
Fact Check :
What are the arguments concerning the constitutionality of the individual mandate ?
Do they have any validity ?
- The individual mandate would require people to have a certain level of health insurance coverage .
This mandate would be enforced by charging those who do not obtain coverage around 2 percent of their annual household income as a penalty .
- Sen. Orrin Hatch , R - Utah , argues the individual mandate is an unconstitutional congressional action : " The question is not whether Congress can regulate the sale of health insurance , but whether Congress may require the purchase of it , " Hatch told the Heritage Foundation , a conservative think tank , in December .
- Republican Sens. Jim DeMint of South Carolina and John Ensign of Nevada pushed a vote on this issue late last year , arguing the individual mandate is not among the enumerated powers granted to Congress under the Constitution .
The point - of - order vote , which could have held up the individual mandate , failed 60 - 39 .
- Cornell University constitutional law scholar Michael Dorf weighed in on the issue of enumerated powers , arguing that the courts have often upheld congressional actions outside of those specifically spelled out in the Constitution .
These actions have been held constitutional when they are considered " necessary and proper " for carrying out those duties which are specifically spelled out .
- A Congressional Research Service report spelled out a number of different constitutional justifications for the individual mandate as well as some constitutional challenges .
" It appears Congresses may have the ability to enact an [ individual mandate ] as part of its taxing and spending power , or its power to regulate interstate commerce , " they write .
However , they add that challenges could be raised under two amendments to the Constitution .
- A challenge could be raised under the Fifth Amendment 's Due Process Clause , but the CRS report casts doubt on the success of such a challenge .
Additionally a challenge could be raised under the religious protections offered by the First Amendment 's " Establishment " and " Free Exercise " clauses .
This challenge could be overcome by allowing certain tailored exemptions to the individual mandate on religious grounds , the report notes .
- A valid challenge to the individual mandate could eventually be heard by the Supreme Court .
However , such a challenge would not be heard for several years , since lower state and federal courts would get first crack at any lawsuits .
Bottom Line :
While the ultimate test of the constitutionality of the individual mandate lies with the Supreme Court , these arguments are serious enough to have prompted a robust discussion .
Given that some version of the individual mandate is present in all three health care proposals should the health care reform package become law , the individual mandate is likely to be a part of the debate on these issues for quite some time .

Ignatius Piazza : Starbuck ’s Employees Just Got a Bonus !
March 5th , 2010
Evidently some whining handwringers saw customers of Starbucks , Peet ’s Coffee and California Pizza Kitchen openly carrying handguns and alerted the two organizations that violent criminals love most–Handgun Control Inc. and the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence –to do something about it .
You know the drill …
Sarah Brady types parade a bunch of kids around , pull exaggerated and unrelated gun death statistics out of thin air and claim if guns are allowed in coffee shops people will start killing each other over who was in line first for a cup of java !
These unenlightened gun-ban advocates do nothing other than create more “ disarmed victim zones ” for criminals and terrorists to gleefully attack without resistance .
Well , Peet ’s Coffee and the California Pizza Kitchen refused to recognize local , state , federal and historical statistics that prove arming citizens actually deters violent crime .
Instead , they were suckered into banning guns in their establishments .
Too bad for them .
I ’m sure millions of gun owners have already found safer places to drink coffee and eat pizza .
Starbucks on the other hand , made a rational , logical and well researched decision to allow guns in their establishments .
As a result , I ’m sure Starbucks will see a significant increase in their business and I am giving every employee of Starbucks a nice bonus in anticipation of their increased work load !
That ’s right .
Watch the two , news videos below that will bring you up to speed on why Starbucks is now THE place to buy your coffee and then see the bonus I have for every Starbucks ’ employee :

Show full PR text GM Supports Event Data Recorder ( EDR ) Mandate to Improve Vehicle Safety
General Motors applauds Representative Gene Green ( D - TX ) for his support of a Federal mandate to install Event Data Recorders ( EDRs ) in all new vehicles .
EDRs can provide important crash related data that will help promote vehicle and occupant safety on America 's roads .
" Broad EDR application and collection of data will help save lives and prevent injuries , " said Michael J. Robinson , Vice President , Environment , Energy and Safety Policy .
EDRs record data for retrieval after a crash that can assist in the understanding of how the vehicle 's systems performed .
Data is stored for the short period just before and after a crash .
" EDRs help us understand vehicle control systems , and more importantly , provide critical crash information to help improve structural and restraint system designs across the vehicle fleet , " says Adrian Lund , president of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety .
GM began widely installing the predecessor version of today 's EDRs in vehicles in the 1990 model year , and they became standard equipment in light duty vehicles in the 1995 model year .
A device that allows for limited public retrieval of the data in GM EDRs has been available since 1999 .
" It is essential that decisions on important safety issues be supported by the best available data , and we are convinced that EDRs can help that process , " said Robinson .
" We agree with those who called for mandatory installation of and greater use of the data from EDRs during recent Congressional hearings . "
GM also supports wider availability of the crash data stored in EDRs .
This data can help in determining crash causes more quickly , and can contribute significantly toward improving the amount and quality of real - world data in state and national safety databases , such as the NHTSA 's Fatality Analysis Recording System ( FARS ) and National Automotive Sampling System ( NASS ) .
" GM will work with NHTSA , Congress and others on this issue , including taking the necessary steps to assure that important concerns about privacy are adequately addressed , " said Robinson .
Additional information about the use of EDRs in GM vehicles can be found at : http://www.gm.com/corporate/responsibility/safety/event_data_recorders/
As of today , when incidents like sudden acceleration happen , it 's extremely difficult to diagnose conclusively what the cause was .
Without a mechanism to track exactly what the driver did , what the vehicle sensors detected and how the vehicle responded , it usually ends up being a he said / she said situation .
Thus , in the wake of recent allegations of unintended acceleration in Toyota vehicles , a movement has begun to equip all cars with black box data recorders .
Representative Gene Green ( D - TX ) has already introduced legislation that would mandate the installation of such event data recorders , or black boxes , in all new vehicles General Motors has now come out publicly in favor of the proposal .
GM has been installing event data recorders in its cars since 1995 as part of the air bag system .
In accidents where the airbags are triggered , GM can use the data stored in the EDR for diagnostic purposes to improve the function of its safety systems .
The recorders save the last few seconds of data before a crash from a number of sensors .
GM is not only supporting the installation of these recorders in all vehicles , but also supports making the data accessible so that accident causes can be more accurately determined .

Jokebook for the Physical Sciences
One of my hobbies is collecting jokes about science , scientists , and related topics .
So here are a few of my favorites , mainly ones about mathematics and physics , though if you know some that are n't here , drop me a line .
If you do n't mind , I 'll annotate them as I go along ...
Index
A mathematician , a physicist and an engineer walk into a bar ...
These first few jokes highlight how the students of different disciplines think .
They 're the ethnic jokes of academia , but unlike most ethnic jokes , the stereotypes expressed have some truth to them .
A mathematician , a physicist , and an engineer are on a train going through Scotland .
The engineer sees a black sheep , and says , " Aha !
The sheep in Scotland are black ! "
The physicist shakes his head and says , " Ha !
You 're wrong !
One sheep in Scotland is black ! "
The mathematician shakes his head sadly and says , " You 're both wrong .
One sheep in Scotland is black on one side ... "
My own personal favorite in this vein is the following ...
Several academics are asked to prove the following proposition : " All odd numbers are prime " They responded as follows :
Mathematician : let 's see ... 3 is prime , and the result follows by mathematical induction .
Physicist : let 's see ... 3 is prime , 5 is prime , 7 is prime , 9 -- whups , that 's composite , 11 is prime , 13 is prime ... it's true , since 9 is an experimental error .
Engineer : let 's see ... 3 is prime , 5 is prime , 7 is prime , 9 is prime , 11 is prime ...
Computer Scientist : let 's see ... 3 is prime , 3 is prime , 3 is prime ...
Economist : let 's see ... 2 is prime , 4 is prime , 6 is prime ...
" Hey ! " say the engineers .
All right , let 's be fair to the engineers .
Unlike economists , they actually produce things that work .
There 's supposedly a natural antipathy of engineers towards mathematicians , and vice versa , though I suspect this exists more in the minds of those who are neither than in the actual practitioners of either art .
Thanks to the mathematicians , the engineers can practice their art with a bit more precision than could the Romans ; thanks to the engineers , the mathematicians can do more than draw circles in the sand and have slaves laboriously copy manuscripts .
Still , the contrast between the " theoretical " mathematician and the highly " practical " engineer makes for some great jokes ...
A mathematician and an engineer were sitting in a room with a beautiful member of the appropriate sex on the other .
Before either can make a move , the Voice of God comes down , and proclaims " At the end of each minute , you may move only half the remaining distance between you and the other side ! "
A lightning bolt strikes the ground in front of the two to show that God means business .
Immediately the engineer leaps up , crosses half the distance , waits a minute , crosses another quarter , waits a minute , and so on .
After a few minutes , the mathematician calls out , " Why are you bothering ?
You 'll never reach the other side ! "
The engineer calls back , confidently , " Ah , but pretty soon I 'll be close enough ! "
Okay , so it 's not much of a joke , but it 's one of the few I know where the engineer gets the better of the mathematician .
Granted , this may have something to do with the fact that I know more mathematicians than engineers .
I submit the following
A mathematician will call an infinite series convergent if its terms go to zero .
A physicist will call it convergent if the first term is finite .
How can you say that ? , you ask , as one of the things that 's drilled into the heads of every student who learns about infinite series is that even if the terms go to zero , the series does not necessarily converge .
My first line of defense is , " Well , it 's only a joke .. " , though that does n't sit well with a lot of people , especially mathematicians .
A better line of defense is that the modern notion of convergence is just that : modern .
During the 18th century , series like the harmonic series were called convergent , though it was well known that its sum was infinite .
Incidentally , Poincare also makes the distinction between convergence , in the sense of a mathematician , and in the sense of a physicist or astronomer , and it is almost the same distinction as above , at least with respect to the physicists .
A mathematician , a physicist , and an engineer were in a hotel for a convention .
Then , in the middle of the night for no apparent reason , a fire breaks out in the engineer 's wastebasket .
The engineer rushes over to the bathroom , empties out the ice bucket , fills it with water and pours it into the trash can , dousing the fire .
Satisfied that the problem was solved , the engineer goes back to sleep .
Shortly thereafter , a fire broke out in the physicist 's wastebasket .
The physicist rushes to the bathroom , whips out his calculator , frantically does a few computations , pulls out a cup , fills it to a precisely measured level , and rushes back to the wastebasket , pouring the water onto the fire .
As the last drop hits the flame , the fire goes out .
Satisfied that the problem was solved , the physicist goes back to sleep .
Finally , a fire breaks out in the mathematician 's room .
The mathematician rushes to the bathroom , sees the ice bucket , sees a cup , sees the water faucet .
Satisfied that the problem could be solved , he goes back to sleep .
A quote I have been unable to track down with certainty is the following toast : " To pure mathematics !
May it never be of any use to any one ! "
It appeared in a New Yorker cartoon some years ago , but it seems to be older than that .
Actually , some of the best jokes just involve physicists and mathematicians .
Here 's another in the same vein :
A mathematician and a physicist were arguing over whose field of study was better .
They decided to settle the argument by posing questions .
The mathematician went first , and posed a complicated mathematical problem .
With a great deal of effort , several books of mathematical tables and techniques , and a few hours , the physicist gave the solved problem to the mathematician , who was duly impressed .
" All right , my turn .
Here 's the problem : you have a pot of water on the stove , at 60 F .
You want to heat it up to 70 F .
What do you do ? "
The mathematician replied , " Oh , that 's easy .
You turn the stove on .
Fourier 's equations govern how heat transfers from the stove to the pot , and you can solve them numerically to find out how long it takes for the water to reach 70 F . "
The physicist then asks , " All right , so what if the water 's at 65 F ? "
" Oh , that 's even easier .
You take the pot of water , stick it in the refrigerator until it cools down to 60 F , and then it simplifies to the previous problem ! "
At its simplest , the joke is represented by the following :
Q : How many mathematicians does it take to screw in a light bulb ?
A : One .
He gives it to seven Lithuanians , and reduces it to the previous joke .
Mathematicians
You can find aleph - one bottles of beer on the wall elsewhere .
But here are a few jokes just about mathematicians and their antics .
A famous mathematical puzzle problem involves the following : two trains on the same track begin a mile apart and head towards each other at 60 miles an hour .
A fly on one train flies at 120 mph to the other train , and when it lands there , it flies back to the other train , and so on , flying back and forth between the two trains until it gets squashed in the middle .
How far does the fly travel ?
A student once asked the great mathematician John von Neumann the above problem .
von Neumann thought about it a moment and said , " One mile " , the correct answer .
" You know , Professor von Neumann , most people do n't realize that the problem 's really easy to figure out : the trains meet in half a minute , and the fly can travel 1 mile in half a minute .
They think they have to add up the infinite series to find out how far the fly travels ! " von Neumann looked stunned and after a pause said , " But that 's how I did it . "
Okay , so now you know the answer to the puzzle , and the easy way to solve it .
( Extra credit question : which way does the fly face at the end ? ) .
Here 's another one that highlights the bane of the mathematics student : the phrase " it is obvious that ... "
First , a bit of historical humor , somewhat related to my thesis :
Laplace 's Mecanique Celeste , an enormous five volume tome on just about everything you ever wanted to know about celestial mechanics , was first translated into the English language by Nathaniel Bowditch .
Though others did it before him , Laplace was notorious for leaving length demonstrations to the reader , usually preceded with " C'est visible que . . "
( It is obvious that .. ) .
Bowditch meticulously filled in all the gaps , but before long he grew to dread those words , for he knew that when he saw them , he was in for a lengthy bit of derivation before what Laplace claimed was obvious was , in fact , obvious .
I had to suffer through not a few of Laplace 's ( and other 's ) " it is obvious that . . "
Now for the fun stuff ..
A professor was notorious for leaving complicated demonstrations to the students , with no more than a remark that " It is obvious that ... "
One day a student interrupted .
" Professor , is it really obvious that the second line follows from the first ? "
The professor looked at the board , wrinkled his brow , paced about the room for a few minutes , then , triumphantly said , " Why yes , it is obvious . "
Here 's another ...
Another professor was notorious for writing very little on the board , verbally describing how to go from derivation to derivation , saying it was as obvious as " Two plus two equals four " .
One day a group of students approached him , and begged him to write more on the board , so they could follow along .
The professor , who did n't realize what he was doing , vowed to do so .
The next day , however , he continued to lecture in his ordinary style , leaping from derivation to derivation with nary a mark on the board .
" Thus , it is as obvious as two plus two equals four " he concluded .
Then he caught the eyes of the students who had approached him earlier , obviously lost in the train of deductions , so he turned to the board and carefully wrote , " 2 + 2 = 4 " .
As you 'll see in the physics section , there are lots of stories told about specific physicists .
However , there are n't many stories told about specific mathematicians ; the von Neumann story is the only one I can think of offhand .
To remedy this , I shall use the time - honored comic tradition of taking an old joke , filing off a few serial numbers , and calling it new ...
Karl Friedrich
Gauss was a child prodigy who later blossomed into the greatest mathematician of the age .
When he was in his prime , a young man approached him , asking what he should do to become a great mathematician .
" If I was you , I would go back to school , and learn as much of the basics of mathematics as I could before I even thought about producing any original work . "
The young man was perplexed .
" But Herr Gauss !
You were publishing important mathematical treatises when you were even younger than I am now . "
" Ah , " Gauss replied , " but I did so without asking for advice . "
Okay , the story is usually told about Mozart , but what 's a little repackaging among friends ?
Incidentally , Gauss decided to become a mathematician only after long debate ; at the age of 19 , he was undecided , and leaning towards a career in philology ( which today we might call linguitics ) .
Then he made the discovery of the millenium : how to construct a regular 17 sided polygon using only compass and straightedge ; it was the first new construction technique to be discovered in almost two thousand years .
With a lead like that , Gauss abandoned the study of words for the study of mathematics .
Here 's another joke about Gauss :
Laplace was once asked by Alexander von Humboldt ( a German scientist who , in addition to writing an immensely popular work on science called Kosmos , was also responsible for making mountain climbing a popular sport ) who the great mathematician in Germany was .
Without hesitation , Laplace said , " Pfaff " .
" Pfaff ? " Humboldt said .
" What about Gauss ? "
" Gauss is the greatest mathematician in the world " was Laplace 's reply .
Physicists
I used to be a physics major , until I discovered I had absolutely no laboratory skills .
I still enjoy theoretical physics , and try ( and usually fail miserably ) to keep up with the fast - growing subject .
My favorite joke about physicists ( or about a particular physicist , at any rate ) is the following ....
Wolfgang Pauli , the great Austrian physicist who died much too young , went to heaven .
At the gate he was greeted by St. Peter who said " Herr Doktor Pauli !
As a reward for your contributions to human understanding of physics , God Himself has consented to let you ask him one question . "
St. Peter took Pauli to an anteroom , where God awaited Pauli 's question .
" Lord , " Pauli said , " I have only one question : the mass ratio between the proton and the electron .
Why 1837 to 1 ? " Instantly a blackboard appeared , and God began to explain why this fundamental ratio was what it was .
Halfway through , Pauli sputtered in exasperation , " Das ist ganz falsch ! " [ " That 's completely wrong ! " ] .
Actually , the version I heard had Pauli asking about the Strong Coupling Constant .
Unfortunately , if I used it in a joke , I would be morally bound to cite its actual value , and furthermore to explain what it was .
This I would have done ... but I could n't find any references to the Strong Coupling Constant in my library .
Anyway , a similar story is told about Einstein ...
Einstein's General Theory of Relativity predicts a certain displacement of starlight , caused by a large mass ; a solar eclipse in 1919 provided the first opportunity to test the theory .
A reporter asked Einstein how he would feel if the observations did not support relativity .
" I would then feel very sorry for God , for having designed the universe wrong " , Einstein replied .
One of the expeditions to measure the Einsteinian displacement of starlight was headed up by the English physicist Arthur Stanley Eddington .
Recently , some doubts have been raised about the validity of Eddington 's experiment ( though General Relativity itself has been tested under a number of other conditions and has passed with flying colors ) .
Talking about Eddington , though ...
A reporter once asked Arthur Stanley Eddington ( who was one of the teams who used the eclipse of 1919 to verify general relativity ) whether it was true that the theory of relativity was so complicated that , except for Einstein , only two other people in the world could understand it .
Eddington sat silently for a moment , his brow furrowed .
The reporter , fearful that he had offended Eddington , asked what was wrong .
" Oh , nothing .
I was just trying to figure out who the other person was . "
Here 's a recycled joke .
but it's one Leon Lederman tells in his book , The God Particle , hence its inclusion here .
For those who are n't Jewish , a " brouchah " ( I hope I spelled it right ) is some sort of a benediction given an inanimate object , to make it permissible for a Jew to use it .
( For those who are Jewish , if I 've totally messed up the definition and / or spelling of a brouchah , tell me . )
Leon Lederman , having just acquired a brand new particle accelerator , and , to make absolutely sure nothing would go wrong , wanted to get a brouchah for it .
First , he approached an Orthodox Rabbi . " Teacher " , Lederman said , " I want to get a brouchah for my particle accelerator . "
" What 's a particle accelerator ? " the rabbi said .
Lederman explained , and after some thought , a consultation of the Torah , a few conversations with the other rabbis , the rabbi finally answered , " My son , I am afraid I can not give a brouchah for such an object .
If you are concerned , you should n't use it . "
Well , that could n't be had , since Lederman had to use the particle accelerator .
Disheartened , but still hopeful , he went to a Conservative Rabbi .
" Teacher " , he said , " I want to get a brouchah for my particle accelerator . "
" What 's a particle accelerator ? " the Rabbi said .
Lederman explained , and after some thought , the rabbi said , " My son , I am afraid I cannot give a brouchah for such an object ; it goes against every tradition .
If it bothers you , do n't use it . "
Again , this was not a suitable answer .
Lederman decided to consult a Reformed rabbi .
" Teacher , I have this new particle accelerator . "
" Oh really ? " the rabbi said , and they discussed particle physics for a few minutes before Lederman continued , " What I need to know is if it 's all right for a Jew to use it . "
" Well , of course " said the rabbi .
" Then will you please give me a brouchah for it ! "
And the Reformed rabbi said , " What 's a brouchah ? "
As I said , it 's an old , recycled joke ; I 've heard it about motorcycles , Christmas trees , and what have you .
What 's interesting is Lederman 's supposed concern with propriety , and the idea that it 's best not to chances with the supernatural .
Which reminds me ...
A reporter went to interview the great Danish physicist Niels Bohr , and was astonished to discover that Bohr had a horseshoe hanging over his desk .
" Surely you do n't believe , Dr. Bohr , that hanging a horseshoe will bring you good luck ! " said the astonished reporter .
" No , of course not .
But I have been informed that it will bring me good luck whether I believe in it or not . "
The philosophical among you might recognize the above as a variation on Pascal 's Principle .
Then again , you might not ... it's arguable .

Their new research argues that estimates of conventional reserves should be downgraded from 1,150bn to 1,350bn barrels to between 850bn and 900bn barrels and claims that demand may outstrip supply as early as 2014 .
The researchers claim it is an open secret that OPEC is likely to have inflated its reserves , but that the International Energy Agency ( IEA ) , BP , the Energy Information Administration and World Oil do not take this into account in their statistics .
How many times does a band have to take the music video world by storm before its record label gets that its members might know a little something about music videos ?
We may never find out , because OK Go , the band in question , has just ditched EMI , the record label in question , largely due to that very problem .
OK
Go rocketed up through the indie rock world in large measure due to the band ’s brilliant , lo - fi music videos , which have spread like wildfire on YouTube .
But EMI , in a misguided attempt to wring every penny out of the band ’s success , decided to block embedding on the YouTube videos–meaning the videos were unable to disseminate out through music and pop culture blogs , news sites , and personal blogs the way they did before the restriction .
And that ’s not a minor detail : the band saw a 90 % drop in views when that restriction went into effect .
As in , 100,000 views one day , 10,000 views the next .
OK
Go is n’t a band with huge hit radio singles ; they ’re a journeyman power pop act that puts out reliably excellent , not blockbuster , albums .
Music videos are the band ’s way of making themselves buzzworthy , and it works : their homemade videos have achieved a level of popularity nobody could have predicted .
So when the label makes their videos less popular , it means , in no uncertain terms , that less people out there know about OK Go , which means less people can buy albums and tickets for the hard - touring band ’s shows .
It ’s a ridiculous decision from the label , and the band was never shy about voicing discontent , even in the most public way possible .
Singer Damian Kulash wrote an op -ed that appeared in The New York Times , a letter to his fans that appeared , among other places , in Gizmodo , and the issue came up in just about every interview the band gave .
Now , the band has taken the final step : leaving EMI , and forming their own Paracadute Recordings label to release future ( and a re-released version of the current Of the Blue Colour of the Sky ) music .

Last week , the American Academy of Pediatrics called
for the redesign of hot dogs .
“ If
you were to take the best engineers in the world and asked them to design a
perfect plug for a child ’s airway , you could n’t do better than a hot dog , ”
said Dr .
Gary Smith , former chairman of the AAP ’s Committee on Injury , Violence , and
Poison Prevention .
“ When it ’s
wedged in tightly , that child is going to die . ”
Never ones to resist a challenge , or the
chance to play with our food , we carved out a little time to explore the redesign
of the hot dog .
We began by thinking outside the bun .
What other ways could we come up with for
hot dog delivery ?
Looking for
inspirations from food innovations like GoGurt and Push Pops , we briefly toyed
with the idea of a semi - solid hot - dog paste …a Push - Pup , if you will , not
unlike the Sushi Popper .
But frankly , the idea of a hot dog in a non-Newtonian
form , was more than a little gag - inducing .
For enhancing a sense of play , we flirted with the idea of
Lego - inspired shapes , like the fruit snacks at right .
But , given the reason behind the call for
redesign , it seemed a bad idea to train kids to eat things shaped like toys .
So we decided the best way to preserve the hot dog
experience would be to work inside the bun , and identified several key factors
to keep in mind :
Esophagus - sized cylinders and spheres = bad , very
bad
bad
Fit within existing buns for “ authentic ” - ish
experience
experience Look for opportunities increase sense of play
Enhance condiment - to - hot dog engagement
We began our exploration in sketch form .
When one designer remembered a friend choking
on a Lifesaver candy , but still being able to breathe , we looked at options
with a hole down the center .
We worry
that these holes could be too easily compressed , and , worse , that people would n’t be
able to resist the urge to stuff the hole with cheese , and that would take us
back to square one as a choking hazard .
Editor 's Note : The Jimmy V Award for Perseverance will be given to Denver Nuggets coach George Karl at the 2010 ESPYS award ceremony .
Rick Reilly chronicled Karl 's battle with cancer this past March ...
DAY 17 :
Tuesday , March 9 , 7:30 a.m. --
Denver Nuggets coach George Karl pops in his mouthpiece and puts on his helmet and braces himself for a brutal 15 minutes , but this is n't football .
This is cancer radiation .
We 're at Denver 's Swedish Medical Center .
The helmet is actually a white , hard - mesh mask that fits to every contour of Karl 's big bucket head .
It has red crosses all over it , like a hockey goalie's .
He lays his 283 pounds on the table and the technicians clamp the mask on hard .
How Karl breathes I 'll never know .
They secure his limbs and ask him to hold a blue plastic donut so no part of him moves .
He looks like Hannibal Lecter about to get fried .
" It makes you a little claustrophobic , " the 58 - year - old coach tries to say through the mask .
" But what are you gonna do ?
Leave ? "
Coaching the wildly talented but wildly uneven Nuggets is hard enough , let alone doing it with throat and neck cancer , but that 's what Karl is trying to do .
Everybody tells him it's not possible , and today , maybe he 's starting to believe them .
With only three of his torturous six weeks of treatment done , and the inside of his mouth looking like he just took 100 bites out of a lava - hot pizza slice , and his head throbbing and his eyes hollow , Karl looks like a guy who should be on a stretcher , not an NBA bench .
" George , this is only going to get harder , " a nurse tells him .
" You 're not going to feel like working . "
Clearly , she 's never met George Karl .
He shows me many things I do n't want to see .
He 's doing it because he wants people to know exactly what it 's like .
Wants to take the fear and mystery out of it for people .
Suddenly , the huge gray machine whirs like a giant Transformer , turning sideways , first this side , then that , as though it 's trying to decide how to eat him .
Then it zaps his throat and neck lymph nodes , ravaging them .
It gives him a radish - red rash that 's covering his face , chest and back .
I know .
He shows me .
He shows me many things I do n't want to see .
He 's doing it because he wants people to know exactly what it 's like .
Wants to take the fear and mystery out of it for people .
" The rash is a good sign , " says the technician .
" It shows the radiation is working . "
" Mine 's not bad , " Karl mumbles , hardly able to talk .
" There 's a guy in here who ca n't even lay his head on a pillow . "
Karl absorbs the machine 's worst for 15 minutes every weekday , except on Wednesdays , when he does it for 30 .
Then he goes to work .
8:15 a.m. --
The coach with the seventh - most wins in NBA history is having a glass of water and looking at film of the Minnesota Timberwolves ahead of the game the next night .
But we 're not in his office .
And the water just went into his stomach through a tube in his gut .
And the hose from the liter bag of Erbitux , a cancer drug , dripping into his left arm hangs over the laptop he 's trying to watch film on .
And we 're not in his office , we 're at the Swedish chemo lab .
This is the one day of the week he adds dripping to the zapping .
You fight the dragon any way they tell you .
If there was a DL for coaches , Karl would be the first five names on it .
He 's not going to get on the team plane this afternoon for Minnesota .
He wo n't coach them there .
For a controllisimo like Karl , that 's torture .
" I woke up today thinking of all the things that could go wrong , " he tries to say through a mouth that sounds like it 's full of rock salt .
" Actually , I did n't really wake up .
I did n't hardly go to sleep .
Could n't . "
I do n't know how your Monday was , but this was Karl's :
He 'd coached the Nuggets to a 12 - point win over Portland the night before .
Did n't hit the sack until 1 .
Got up at 5 .
Was at the hospital by 6 .
Had surgery at 6:30 to put in the stomach tube that , coming soon , will be the only way he 'll eat .
Out of surgery at 7 .
Radiation at 8 . Home by 10 .
Nap .

U.S. Rep. Jared Polis , D - Boulder , wants “ rogue ” federal agents to lay off medical marijuana dispensaries after a raid at the home of Highlands Ranch grower on Feb. 12 .
Tuesday , Polis sent a letter to U.S. Attorney General Eric
Holder asking him to instruct agents to abide by the Justice Department ’s Oct. 19 directive to allow deference to state laws on legalized medical marijuana use , or to clarify the new position .
Polis posted his letter this afternoon on the progressive political website Square State .
In a preamble he referred to “ rogue agents … harassing and raiding our medical marijuana dispensaries . ”
Reached by phone in Washington this evening , Polis also invoked the White House .
“ I think President Obama has clearly stated his position on respecting states that have voted to allow medical marijuana , ” he said .
“ I believe the words and action of the agent in charge is in contradiction to the will of the voters of Colorado . ”
In the letter , he noted a Denver Post story on Feb. 13 that quoted DEA agent Jeffrey Sweetin as saying , “ We ’re still going to continue to investigate and arrest people … Technically , every dispensary in the state is in blatant violation of federal law . ”
The grower , Chris Bartkowicz , is free on $ 10,000 bond after his arrest on a drug - distribution charge .
Drug Enforcement Administration agents seized 224 marijuana plants .
He did not return a call for comment this evening .
Justice Department and DEA spokespeople were not immediately available for comment .
Experts have called the case precedent - setting .
“ It strikes fear in the hearts of many medical marijuana patients in Colorado , and that ’s unfortunate , ” Polis said in an interview .

I was pulling my hair out this morning reading this Washington Post piece .
Titled “ Despite his roots , Obama struggles to show he ’s connected to middle class , ” it ’s one of those classics of Washington political journalism where the thesis is unsupported by any hard evidence and where the anecdotal evidence is embarrassingly off - point , irrelevant , or insubstantial — or , in this case , all three .
But in this case , it ’s even worse .
The Washington Post ‘s own polling data do n’t just undermine the premise of the piece ; they refute it .
The article begins and ends with the usual trope , setting the scene of a President sealed off by the perks of office from the suffering of everyday Americans , but it goes farther than that and asserts that Obama himself is especially disconnected :
It is a tough sell for any president who lives inside what Obama refers to as “ the bubble , ” but tougher still for Obama .
His first year in office was defined in part by a paradox .
He is a rare president who comes from the middle class , yet people still perceive him as disconnected from it .
Then , amidst the cliched Obama anecdotes about arugula and bowling , we get the only hard evidence to support this thesis :
As he arrived in Nashua , nearly two - thirds of Americans believed that his economic policies had hurt the country or made no difference at all ; almost half thought he did not understand their problems .
Almost half ?
Does that mean more than half thought he did understand their problems ?
Why , yes .
Yes , it does .
As Greg Sargent points out , the Post ‘s own polling in mid-January shows that 57 % of those surveyed agreed that “ He understands the problems of people like you . ”
Notably , that number has been above 50 percent for Obama ’s entire first year in office , including periods above 70 percent last year .
The Post ‘s own polling also asks if Obama “ shares your values . ”
That number , too , has remained above 50 % , most recently coming in at 55 % in mid-January .
At this point , the article falls apart under the weight of its own misinterpreted data and well - worn anecdotes , but there ’s still room to squeeze in one more bit of Washington conventional wisdom , a homily to that plain - spoken man of the people , George W. Bush :
Those shortcomings were evident last month when Obama invited the previous two presidents to join him at the White House for a news conference about the U.S. relief effort in Haiti .
George W. Bush was simple and frank : “ Just send us your cash , ” he said . …
In the two weeks since , Obama appears to have learned from his predecessors ’ trademark strengths .
It ’s a story that practically writes itself .
Late Update : After reading this post , TPM Reader PH asked the Post about this story in one of its online chats with staff writer Scott Wilson ( who did not pen the original article ) :
Prescott , Ariz : Today the Post ran an article titled “ Despite his roots , Obama struggles to show he ’s connected to middle class . ”
The Post ’s own polling shows that 57 % of people think the president “ understands people like you ” .
…
Why do we get articles like this that are refuted by your own research ?
Scott Wilson :
Are those 57 percent self - identified as “ middle class ? ” A lot of Americans think he understands Wall Street better than he understands them .
Setting aside the gratuitous assertion about Wall Street , Wilson would have us believe that the 57 percent are not middle class , but that the “ almost half ” cited in the original article , the other 42 percent , are all middle class .
Enough to make your head spin .
The Church has been hit by worldwide sex abuse scandals
Lawyers acting for alleged victims of abuse say the document proves that for decades the Vatican has systematically obstructed the course of justice in order to protect Catholic priests .
Church lawyers , on the other hand , argue that the document referred only to church law and did not order bishops to engage in criminal cover-ups .
But the US lawyer who uncovered the document told a British newspaper the archive material is a smoking gun .
The lawyer , Daniel Shea , told The Observer newspaper the 1962 Vatican instruction was " a devious attempt to conceal criminal conduct " .
It " is a blueprint for deception and concealment " , the Sunday newspaper quotes him as saying .
So that these matters be pursued in a most secretive way , everyone is to be restrained by a perpetual silence under penalty of excommunication .
Read extracts from document
Mr Shea , who represents alleged victims of abuse by Catholic priests , obtained the document from an American priest and handed it over to US authorities .
It bears the seal of Pope John XXIII , and calls for " strictest " secrecy in dealing with abuse allegations within the Church .
It threatens to expel from the Church anyone who breaks their silence .
It deals primarily with priests accused of propositioning congregants during confession , the Catholic rite in which the faithful tell priests of their sins .
Mr Shea says he was given the document by a clergyman in Germany who has close dealings with the Vatican .
He handed a copy of the document to US authorities late last month .
Church 's defence
Early in August , the US Conference of Catholic Bishops said that the document , " Instruction on the manner of proceeding in cases of solicitation " , had not been in force for years .
Cardinal Law was forced out by cover-ups
The Vatican 's 1983 Code of Canon Law says a priest found to have abused a minor can be defrocked .
The conference also said the 1962 document " had no bearing on civil law " and had been misrepresented .
The US Catholic Church has been rocked by revelations of sexual abuse by priests .
Bishops there have been accused of protecting priests suspected of sexual abuse , moving them to new parishes rather than confronting the problem .
The leader of England and Wales 's Catholics , Archbishop Cormac Murphy - O'Connor , has apologised for relocating priest Michael Hill when accusations against him arose .
Vatican critics say the 1962 document suggests bishops who moved priests may have been acting in line with instructions from Rome .
They also say its age refutes Church claims that the problem of sex abuse by priests is a new one .
The Archbishop of Boston , Cardinal Bernard Law , was forced to resign late last year after he admitted he had covered up sexual abuse by priests for many years .
The Church faces hundreds of civil lawsuits by people who say they were abused .
OKLAHOMA CITY --
A man got a prison term longer than prosecutors and defense attorneys had agreed to because of Larry Bird .
The lawyers reached a plea agreement Tuesday for a 30 - year term for a man accused of shooting with an intent to kill and robbery .
But Eric James
Torpy wanted his prison term to match Bird 's jersey
number 33 .
" He said if he was going to go down , he was going to go down in Larry Bird 's jersey , " Oklahoma County District Judge Ray Elliott said Wednesday .
" We accommodated his request and he was just as
happy as he could be .
" I 've never seen anything like this in 26 years in the
courthouse .
But , I know the DA is happy about it . "
From the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory :
Soils release more carbon dioxide as globe warms
The researchers overlaid the soil respiration database — which is openly available for the scientific community to add to — on Google Earth .
COLLEGE PARK , Md. – Twenty years of field studies reveal that as the Earth has gotten warmer , plants and microbes in the soil have given off more carbon dioxide .
So - called soil respiration has increased about one - tenth of 1 percent per year since 1989 , according to an analysis of past studies in today ’s issue of Nature .
The scientists also calculated the total amount of carbon dioxide flowing from soils , which is about 10 - 15 percent higher than previous measurements .
That number — about 98 petagrams of carbon a year ( or 98 billion metric tons ) — will help scientists build a better overall model of how carbon in its many forms cycles throughout the Earth .
Understanding soil respiration is central to understanding how the global carbon cycle affects climate .
“ There ’s a big pulse of carbon dioxide coming off of the surface of the soil everywhere in the world , ” said ecologist Ben Bond - Lamberty of the Department of Energy ’s Pacific Northwest National Laboratory .
“ We were n’t sure if we ’d be able to measure it going into this analysis , but we did find a response to temperature . ”
The increase in carbon dioxide given off by soils — about 0.1 petagram ( 100 million metric tons ) per year since 1989 — wo n’t contribute to the greenhouse effect unless it comes from carbon that had been locked away out of the system for a long time , such as in Arctic tundra .
This analysis could not distinguish whether the carbon was coming from old stores or from vegetation growing faster due to a warmer climate .
But other lines of evidence suggest warming is unlocking old carbon , said Bond - Lamberty , so it will be important to determine the sources of extra carbon .
The Opposite of Photosynthesis
Plants are famous for photosynthesis , the process that stores energy in sugars built from carbon dioxide and water .
Photosynthesis produces the oxygen we breathe as a byproduct .
But plants also use oxygen and release carbon dioxide in the same manner that people and animals do .
Soil respiration includes carbon dioxide from both plants and soil microbes , and is a major component of the global carbon cycle .
Theoretically , the biochemical reactions that plants and soil microbes engage in to produce carbon dioxide suggest that higher temperatures should result in more carbon dioxide being released .
But unlike the amount of sunlight reaching Earth , soil respiration ca n’t be measured from space and ca n’t yet be simulated effectively with computer models .
So , the researchers turned to previous studies to see if they could quantify changes in global soil respiration .
PNNL ’s Bond - Lamberty and his colleague Allison Thomson , working at the Joint Global Change Research Institute in College Park , Md. , examined 439 soil respiration studies published between 1989 and 2008 .
They compiled data about how much carbon dioxide has leaked from plants and microbes in soil in an openly available database .
To maintain consistency , they selected only data that scientists collected via the now - standard methods of gas chromatography and infrared gas analysis .
The duo compared 1,434 soil carbon data points from the studies with temperature and precipitation data in the geographic regions from other climate research databases .
After subjecting their comparisons to statistical analysis , the researchers found that the total amount of carbon dioxide being emitted from soil in 2008 was more than in 1989 .
In addition , the rise in global temperatures correlated with the rise in global carbon flux .
However , they did not find a similar relation between precipitation and carbon .
Zooming In
Previous climate change research shows that Arctic zones have a lot more carbon locked away than other regions .
Using the complete set of data collected from the studies , the team estimated that the carbon released in northern — also called boreal — and Arctic regions rose by about 7 percent ; in temperate regions by about 2 percent ; and in tropical regions by about 3 percent , showing a trend consistent with other work .
The researchers wanted to know if their data could provide more detailed information about each region .
So they broke down the complete data set by regional climates and re-examined the smaller groups of data using different statistical methods .
The regional data from the temperate and tropical climates produced results consistent with other results , such as more carbon being released at higher temperatures , but the boreal - Arctic climate data did not .
In addition , removing only 10 percent of the boreal - Arctic data points was enough to invalidate the statistical significance of the boreal - Arctic result .
Together , the results support the idea that more boreal data on regional climates is needed to reach statistical relevance .
“ We identified an area where we need to do more work , ” said Thomson .
The authors designed the database so that other researchers could contribute to it .
The paper describing the database can be found online in Biogeosciences .

8.5 x 11 Booklets ( Most Common )
8.5 inch wide by 11 inch height .
Folded and Stapled on the 11 inch edge .
Available from 8 to 60 Pages .
These are the MOST commonly used for program guides , product catalogs , magazines and more .
A ground - breaking study published in the March 2010 Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism found an astonishing 59 per cent of study subjects had too little Vitamin D in their blood .
Nearly a quarter of the group had serious deficiencies ( less than 20 ng / ml ) of this important vitamin .
Since Vitamin
D insufficiency is linked to increased body fat , decreased muscle strength and a range of disorders , this is a serious health issue .
" Vitamin D insufficiency is a risk factor for other diseases , " explains principal investigator , Dr. Richard Kremer , co-director of the Musculoskeletal Axis of the Research Institute of the MUHC .
" Because it is linked to increased body fat , it may affect many different parts of the body .
Abnormal levels of Vitamin D are associated with a whole spectrum of diseases , including cancer , osteoporosis and diabetes , as well as cardiovascular and autoimmune disorders . "
The study by Dr. Kremer and co-investigator Dr. Vincente Gilsanz , head of musculoskeletal imaging at the Children 's Hospital Los Angeles of the University of Southern California , is the first to show a clear link between Vitamin D levels and the accumulation of fat in muscle tissue -- a factor in muscle strength and overall health .
Scientists have known for years that Vitamin D is essential for muscle strength .
Studies in the elderly have showed bedridden patients quickly gain strength when given Vitamin D .
The study results are especially surprising , because study subjects -- all healthy young women living in California -- could logically be expected to benefit from good diet , outdoor activities and ample exposure to sunshine -- the trigger that causes the body to produce Vitamin D .
" We are not yet sure what is causing Vitamin D insufficiency in this group , " says Dr. Kremer who is also Professor of Medicine at McGill University .
High levels of Vitamin D could help reduce body fat .
Or , fat tissues might absorb or retain Vitamin D , so that people with more fat are likely to also be Vitamin D deficient . "
The results extend those of an earlier study by Dr. Kremer and Dr. Gilsanz , which linked low levels of Vitamin D to increased visceral fat in a young population .
" In the present study , we found an inverse relationship between Vitamin D and muscle fat , " Dr. Kremer says .
" The lower the levels of Vitamin D the more fat in subjects ' muscles . "
While study results may inspire some people to start taking Vitamin D supplements , Dr. Kremer recommends caution .
" Obviously this subject requires more study , " he says .
" We do n't yet know whether Vitamin D supplementation would actually result in less accumulation of fat in the muscles or increase muscle strength .
We need more research before we can recommend interventions .
We need to take things one step at a time . "

Let 's face it .
Health insurance companies charge as much money as possible , and they provide as little care as possible .
The difference is called profit .
You can't blame them for it ; that 's what a corporation does .
Birds got to fly , fish got to swim , health insurers got to rip you off .
And if you get really expensive , they 've got to pull the plug on you .
So for those of us who would like to stay alive , we need a public option .
In many areas of the country , one or two insurers have over 80 % of the market .
They can charge anything they want .
And when you get sick , they can flip the bird at you .
So we need a public option .
And they face no real competition because it costs billions of dollars just to set up a national health care network .
In fact , the only one that 's nationwide is . . .
Medicare .
And we limit that to one - eight of the population .
It 's like saying that only seniors can drive on federal highways .
We really need a public option .
And to the right - wing loons who call it socialism , we say , " if you want to be a slave to the insurance companies , that 's fine .
If you want 30 % of your premiums to go to ‘ administrative costs ' and billion - dollar bonuses for insurance CEOs who figure out new and creative ways to deny you the care you need to stay healthy and alive , that 's fine .
But do n't you try to dictate to me that I can't have a public option ! "
And there is a way left to get it .
By insisting on a vote on H.R. 4789 .
Three votes on health care , not two .
The Senate bill , the reconciliation amendments , and the Public Option Act .

Anyone serious about craft beer should know that great beer should be enjoyed responsibly .
Many of the most interesting and unusual beers out there frequently carry with them high alcohol percentages , some as high as 13 or 14 % .
Beer this strong can have a powerful effect on anyone .
Today , we ’re going to take a look at how alcohol affects the brain .
There are basically four stages of intoxication -
1st Stage –
The first part of the brain alcohol hits is your cerebral cortex , making you more talkative and less inhibited .
Because the cerebral cortex controls conscious thought , language and social interaction , these aspects of our personality begin to run less efficiently under the influence of alcohol .
2nd Stage –
After the cerebral cortex , alcohol begins to affect the hippocampus , resulting in memory loss and exaggerated emotions .
This is the part of the evening when you begin having trouble with balance and start telling everyone “ I love you , man ! ”
Due to the importance of the hippocampus in long - term memory retention , this is also when memory starts to get a little fuzzy .
3rd Stage – Next up on alcohol ’s hit list is the cerebellum , which seriously impairs your coordination and balance .
This is not a pretty sight .
The typical person usually has so much trouble keeping their balance at this point that they can no longer stand up .
Nausea and vomiting frequently occur during this stage .
Scientists believe that these symptoms stem from increased levels of acetaldehyde present in the body , a by product of metabolizing alcohol .
4th Stage – Finally alcohol makes it way to your medulla , frequently resulting in disruptions of automatic functions , like heart rate & breathing .
This is serious and immediate medical attention should be sought .
Usually a person is passed out at this point , and alcohol poisoning is a high risk .
As soon as you consume alcohol , your body begins breaking it down .
Your liver metabolizes around 90 % of the alcohol you consume .
The remaining 10 % is actually excreted through urine and breath , albeit at a much slower rate .
The average liver can metabolize about 1 drink per hour .
If you consume more than that , the liver ca n’t break the alcohol down fast enough , and you begin to get drunk .
Having some food with your beer can slow down the consumption rate , causing you to get less drunk , but it ’s no excuse to drink excessively .
Great beer should be enjoyed for its taste and merit , not as a way to get drunk .
If you have concerns about your alcohol consumption or that of someone you know , the best idea is to consult a medical professional .
In an announcement published last week , Nokia 's Valtteri Halla revealed that Intel and Nokia are planning to launch the public MeeGo source code repository by the end of the month .
The MeeGo project began to take shape last month when Intel and Nokia announced plans to merge their respective Linux - based mobile computing platforms into a single open source software project .
The unified software platform , which consists of technology from Maemo and Moblin , will be designed for use on a wide range of device form factors and will support both ARM and x86 architectures .
Nokia and Intel have turned to the Linux Foundation to help coordinate the project with the hope that vendor - neutral oversight will help attract the participation of other mobile Linux vendors .
According to Halla , who is Nokia 's representative on the nascent MeeGo technical steering committee , the new MeeGo platform will be more open and inclusive than Moblin or Maemo were individually .
The platform will be developed in the open with a broadly transparent research and development process .
" Once we just get going the objective is to have all of the MeeGo platform work fully in public .
During the last few years both Nokia and Intel have learned that the success of Moblin and Maemo R&D mode fundamentally comes from the Open Source way of openness and MeeGo is a huge further commitment on this path , " he wrote .
" MeeGo is supposed to go beyond its parents in openness . "
Although he sets high expectations for MeeGo's commitment to openness , he also acknowledges that there will be challenges in making the transition .
Maemo and Moblin have much in common , but the technical and philosophical differences between the two communities could pose a barrier to harmonious convergence .
Both sides will have to put in a lot of effort and exhibit a willingness to adapt in order to make MeeGo successful .
In the blog entry , Halla calls for members of the existing Maemo and Moblin communities to help build the new development process together by engaging in constructive dialog and collaborating with each other .
The convergence process seems to have gotten a promising start .
When the source code is made available at the end of the month , it will include basic support for running on Atom test boards and Nokia 's N900 smartphone .
This is a promising sign for N900 owners , who were initially concerned that they might get left behind by the new mobile software platform .
" Nokia and Intel have set the target to open the MeeGo repository by the end of this month .
I guess this is something that finally will signify the real ' Day One ' of MeeGo project , a genuine merger of moblin and maemo , " wrote Halla .
" What is scheduled to be available then is the first and very raw baseline to a source and binary repository to build MeeGo trunk on Intel ATOM boards and Nokia N900 . "
Supporting the N900 at this stage is a pretty savvy move by Nokia , because it means that the product 's audience of mobile Linux enthusiasts will be able to participate in MeeGo development on real - world hardware right from the start .
It 's unclear , however , if MeeGo will continue to be optimally N900 - compatible going forward .
Nokia has made it pretty clear that multitouch interfaces are going to be a big part of their next - generation mobile platform , but multitouch is not supported by the N900 .
If the MeeGo project continues moving forward at a good pace and lives up to the promises of openness , it could have major adoption potential .
It has several advantages over Google 's Linux - based Android platform .
One of those advantages is that MeeGo is more closely aligned with the upstream kernel community and the conventional Linux software stack .
This makes it possible for MeeGo adopters to leverage the broad ecosystem of existing third - party Linux software and technologies .
It 's a very different approach from Android , which has its own insular userspace environment that runs on top of a modified Linux kernel that is gradually diverging from the mainline kernel tree .
If the MeeGo project delivers on fully public development , that could also potentially give it a substantial advantage over Android .
Although Android is open source software , the actual development process largely takes place behind closed doors .
Significant changes to the Android source are made public in massive code drops that take place after each major release .
Android 's approach , which could be characterized as the " cathedral " model , is problematic because it largely excludes individual third - party developers from having a voice in the process and prevents them from preemptively updating their applications to support upcoming devices .
MeeGo has an opportunity to win the loyalty of third - party developers if it can do better than that .
Of course , there is a big difference between making promises and delivering on them .
Every new mobile Linux initiative that has promised unprecedented openness has largely fallen short of that goal .
Execution is what really counts in the end .
The close involvement of the Linux Foundation is a positive sign that Nokia and Intel are serious about making MeeGo into a truly open project , but there are still a lot of challenges to be overcome .
I love lots of things about France ; I just do n't like speaking French .
On a recent trip , I went to a chemist to buy Lemsip – or the French equivalent – for my friend .
" Bonjour , avez - vous le… ermmm … je voudrais … ermmm , " I started .
" Mon amis est malade , " I tried , unable to think of the French for cold or flu .
I moved on to mime : faking a cough , wrapping my arms around myself and pretending to shiver .
The woman behind the counter held out some tablets but I shook my head .
Then it was tearing open an imaginary sachet , pouring it into a cup , adding water and drinking – blowing occasionally to indicate heat .
She looked bemused .
" Le flu ? " I pleaded .
Finally – finally – she picked out what I was looking for and handed it over .
I walked out feeling ashamed .
And that is French : a language I studied up to 16 and one in which I , unbelievably , achieved a top grade at GCSE .
When it comes to German , I 'm just glad that the answer to the only phrase I know – " Sprechen sie Englisch ? " – is nearly always yes .
And I 'm far from alone .
One friend recently described watching a group of French locals break down in laughter as she tried to explain / mime that the gear lever in her car was stuck .
So we all know Brits are bad at languages but what are we going to do about it ?
The government 's big idea in 2002 was to remove compulsory language studies after the age of 14 and instead drive resources into primary schools .
That , they said , would enthuse children about languages and they would choose to keep studying them .
The numbers studying a language plummeted .
And it took another seven years before the roll - out at primary even began .
The result is a lost generation .
But even now , there is far too little focus on foreign languages .
A survey published by Cilt , the National Centre for Languages , found that many English schools were abandoning a benchmark that aimed to ensure 50 % to 90 % of pupils studied a language at GCSE .
It also found that the time 11 - to 14 - year - olds spent learning a language had fallen .
And while four out of 10 schools arranged exchanges , many said they were becoming increasingly difficult .
Yet so many adults , myself included , look back at school with one big regret : that they left unable to converse in foreign languages .
It is more than just being able to order a Lemsip .
In terms of useful skills learnt at school , language ability is surely one of the most vital .
So here is what I 'd like to see : languages embedded in primary schools , with not one subject but two compulsory at secondary school up to 16 .
And thinking about my French ability after a GCSE , I 'm sure that is not enough .
We need more hours in the classroom each week , more material for pupils to take home and more exchanges .
It would be even better if A - level students , of whatever subject , had to take a language course on the side and were encouraged to live abroad .
I 'm sure officials would say that there was n't the money or expertise , but I really think the time has come to force language education up the agenda .
After all , would n't it be nice to bring an end to that old joke , that the name for someone who speaks two languages is bilingual and the name for someone who speaks one is British ?

The result was , as you might suspect , pretty weird and surreal .
The Octomom kept making these shrieking laughs :
Suleman said she had n’t been on a date in ten years .
Questions included , “ I ’ve been told that I have fill luscious lips ; can you make up a poem about them ? ”
When a contestant came up with an inarticulate answer , Suleman said blithely , “ That ’s okay .
You ’re busy in your head . ”
I was struck by how poised Suleman was throughout this stunt .
But I guess this is the sort of on - camera life she wants .
I wonder who was baby - sitting during the taping of this show ?
Man in Peaches drug claim was expelled from university ' for threat to kill girl '
The man who posted pictures of Peaches Geldof online after they had a lurid one - night stand has previously been accused of threatening to slit the throat of another 21 - year - old girl .
In 2007 Ben Mills was accused of holding a female student at his New Jersey university at knifepoint and saying he would kill her .
Police sources said he was charged with aggravated assault , criminal restraint , possession of a weapon and the US offence of making ‘ terroristic threats ’ .
They said he was subsequently expelled , although the charges were thought to have been dropped .
Glazed : Peaches with Ben Mills in one of the photos he has posted online
The troubling development will cause more anguish to Peaches ’ father , Live Aid founder Bob Geldof .
Twenty - three - year - old Mills , who friends say is now a struggling New York artist , has posted nude photos on the online site Reddit.com of him with Peaches , 21 .
He claims the pictures were taken during a heroin - fuelled one - night stand in Los Angeles last November after which they allegedly underwent a detoxification ritual at a Scientology centre .
Lawyers for Peaches contend the photos were taken when the pair were drunk , rather than doing drugs .
Controversial : Peaches Geldof in one of the shots published in the U.S ; we have cropped it for decency
New York writer Sara Drew Grant , who was invited on several dates by Mills this year , said he has a reputation as an exhibitionist .
But she said she was shocked by his decision to publicly humiliate Peaches , adding : ‘ He did n’t seem like the type to post the pics to the internet . ’
According to public records , however , Mills has a controversial past .
He grew up in a wealthy area of California ’s Silicon Valley and was a brilliant student , who read politics at Drew University in New Jersey .
But on March 3 , 2007 , police investigated a report from an undergraduate who claimed he had locked her inside her college residence , held a knife to her throat and threatened to kill her .
Peaches was instantly recognisable in the pictures which were originally posted on website Reddit because of the distinctive tattoos all over her body
She escaped after a brief struggle and Mills was charged and held in a jail .
Last night a police source said : ‘ I can not reveal the outcome of the case except to tell you that Mr Mills was expelled from the university . ’
The artist claims he met Peaches when they were staying with a mutual friend while she attempted to record a debut album .
They allegedly drove around Los Angeles looking for syringes and cotton wool .
They also bought lemons to dissolve heroin that he claimed Peaches said she had brought from England .
Shrugging off the scandal : Peaches was spotted getting a Starbucks in Los Angeles on Saturday
By 5 am , Mills claimed : ‘ I was high as a kite and we start to watch a movie .
Things get hot and heavy and before I know it we ’re naked . ’
Peaches has long been linked to drugs .
In May 2008 she was questioned but not charged after being seen offering a drug pusher up to £ 190 , and two months later she was treated by emergency paramedics after an overdose and was believed to have stopped breathing for several minutes until she was revived .
In August 2008 , she admitted she took drugs but insisted : ‘ It ’s something people go through in their lives , especially growing up in London . ’
Her lawyers have denied Mills ’s claims .
They said : ‘ The allegations that our client was carrying and injecting heroin are denied , our client having consumed alcohol with the other individual leading to the “ highs ” described and portrayed in the photographs . ’
They said the alleged visit to a Scientology centre was ‘ fictitious ’ .
Mills could not immediately be located for comment .

Recently I read a blog post at WritersDigest.com that discussed the # 1 myth of story beginnings :
You MUST open with action .
The point of the article is clear : Action without context is just as worthless as background story without action .
The key to beginnings is to introduce two things : 1 . Characterization .
2 . Plot / Theme .
Notice that nowhere in those first two requirements is ‘ action . ’
I think that the myth of ‘ you must have action ’ stems from a misunderstanding between action and plot .
If you go with the general advice of ‘ you must start with action , ’ then should n’t every story begin with gunshots , murderous chases , and exploding spaceports ?
Because most do n’t .
So , let ’s discuss what you DO need to start your story with , beginning with Characterization :
Characterization
From the beginning , you must immediately answer the voiced or subconscious question in your reader ’s mind :
Why should I care about this character ( or these characters , as it may be ) ?
If I have to follow someone for 100,000 words , I damn well better like them , even if they ’re designed to be ‘ unlikeable ’ ( Marvin the Robot , anyone ? ) .
If your characterization comes through clear and strong on paper then I ’ll be naturally drawn to your character and want to stick around to enjoy them and / or see what happens to them .
Example : Ender ’s Game by Orson Scott Card :
“ I ’ve watched through his eyes .
I ’ve listened through his ears , and I tell you he ’s the one .
Or at least as close as we ’re going to get . ”
“ That ’s what you said about the brother . ”
“ The brother tested out impossible .
For other reasons .
Nothing to do with his ability . ”
“ Same with the sister .
And there are doubts about him .
He ’s too malleable .
Too willing to submerge himself in someone else ’s will . ”
“ Not if the other person is his enemy . ”
So much characterization was conveyed in this short paragraph .
Immediately I want to know who it is they ’re talking about .
I want to meet this character and learn more about him .
There ’s not much action in this beginning ; actually , the first chapter is dialogue from unnamed sources ( how much more anti-action can you get ? ) , but this beginning is ripe with characterization , and thus it is a good beginning .
Plot / Theme
The other way to start a story is through clearly and creatively introducing the plot or theme .
I say plot / theme because sometimes you get a plot without a strong theme , or you get a theme without a strong plot , and both are okay .
As a writer who tends to slide more into the ‘ literary fiction ’ side of things , I ’m particularly fond of the ‘ introduce the theme ’ beginning .
Common examples of these are the dramatic prologue ( love love love ! ) or the artistic description of a single , symbolic object , etc .
Example : The Bluest Eye by Toni Morrison :
( All 3 chapters are excellent examples of Theme introduction , but I ’m going to skip the first chapter and head to the second .
If you want to know why I skipped the first chapter , you can read the intro to this book here at Amazon )
Quiet as it ’s kept , there were no marigolds in the fall of 1941 .
We thought , at the time , that it was because Pecola was having her father ’s baby that the marigolds did not grow .
A little examination and much less melancholy would have proved to us that our seeds were not the only ones that did not sprout ; nobody ’s did .
Not even the gardens fronting the lake showed marigolds that year .
But so deeply concerned were we with the health and safe delivery of Pecola ’s baby we could think of nothing but our own magic : if we planted the seeds , and said the right words over them , they would blossom , and everything would be all right .
( This is also the book that contains my favorite phrase of all time : Nuns go by , quiet as lust . )
By reading the paragraph above you can clearly tell that this is going to be a rich and dark literary novel , full of the human condition and childlike innocence thwarted .
All from one paragraph .
If you ’re a theme - lover like myself , this book is pure gold , and it ’s obvious right from the first paragraph .
Action
So , now that we ’ve explored two good examples of beginning with characterization and plot / theme , let ’s explore the benefits of alternative to action by looking at bad action .
The worst thing you can do is open by confusing your readers .
If they do n’t ‘ get it ’ within a few paragraphs ( yes , paragraphs , not pages ! ) they ’ll put it down and that will be that .
Action must have context !
Now , I was hoping to provide an example of a book that opened with totally confusing action , but books that open like that are not good books , and thus I probably put them down after a few pages and have forgotten them .
So , let ’s make something up :
Aidan rolled to his feet and fired off a shot at the advancing Duke , activating his MicroShield just in time to fend off the blastwave from the Duke ’s proton - launcher .
“ Balthazar , get me out of here ! ”
He yelled over his shoulder to the Moore fiddling with the rusty engine of the blimp .
“ Aidan , behind you ! ” screamed Sasha Eskanova , and Aidan ducked as the claws from a leaping panther grazed his ears .
Aidan karate - chopped the oversized housecat as it morphed into a pack of ninja assassins .
“ Time to go ! ”
Cannons roaring in the distance , Aidan , Sasha , and Balthazar leapt aboard the USS Titan ’s wake , lifting into the air as the cavalry advanced over the hill , muskets blazing .
Umm … just what exactly is going on here ?
There ’s too much action and not enough back story , especially with the clashing mix of historical clue-ins .
Read this next bit very carefully : Action without context is pointless .
Remember that , and you ’ll do fine . 🙂
So , readers , what do you think ?
Do you know of any books where the author pulled off beginning with action successfully ?

VATICAN CITY–The Vatican on Sunday denied its celibacy requirement for priests was the root cause of the clerical sex abuse scandal convulsing the church in Europe and again defended the Pope 's handling of the crisis .
Suggestions that the celibacy rule was in part responsible for the " deviant behaviour " of sexually abusive priests have swirled in recent days , with opinion pieces in German newspapers blaming it for fuelling abuse and even Italian commentators questioning the rule .
Much of the furor was spurred by comments from one of the Pope 's closest advisers , Vienna archbishop Cardinal Christoph Schoenborn , who called last week for an honest examination of issues like celibacy and priestly education to root out the origins of sex abuse .
" Part of it is the question of celibacy , as well as the subject of character development .
And part of it is a large portion of honesty , in the church but also in society , " he wrote in the online edition of his diocesan newsletter .
His office quickly stressed Schoenborn was n't calling into question priestly celibacy , which Pope Benedict XVI reaffirmed as recently as Friday as an " expression of the gift of oneself to God and others . "
But Schoenborn has a history of being receptive to arguments that a celibate priesthood is increasingly problematic for the church , primarily because it limits the number of men who seek ordination .
Last June , he presented the Vatican with a lay initiative signed by prominent Austrian Catholics calling for the celibacy rule to be abolished and for married men to be allowed to become priests .
# 31 : The Problem We All Live With by Norman Rockwell
The Problem We All Live With by Norman Rockwell , 1964
This analysis copyright Scott M. McDaniel , 2010
The Image
Larger Version
Driving up I could see the crowd , but living in New Orleans , I actually thought it was Mardi Gras .
There was a large crowd of people outside of the school .
They were throwing things and shouting , and that sort of goes on in New Orleans at Mardi Gras .
I really did n’t realize until I got into the school that something else was going on .
– Ruby Bridges Hall
On November 14 , 1960 federal marshals escorted Ruby Hall to her first day of kindergarten .
She was the only black child to attend the school , and after entering the building she and her mother went to the principal ’s office while the white parents came in and took their children out .
Thereafter she was the only student in her class .
You can read more about the story at the link above or at her entry in Wikipedia .
Norman Rockwell painted this picture for Look magazine .
Though J. C. Leyendecker did more covers for the Saturday Evening Post , Rockwell is best known for his long run with them .
Their art direction and editorial guidelines constrained his work , however , and after his last painting for them in 1963 he moved in a more socially outspoken direction , and Look was buying .
In this analysis I ’ll look at what makes this very simple painting so powerful .
Black and White
A good illustration needs a clear silhouette .
Rockwell certainly provides us with one .
In the greyscale version of the picture below , we can see that Rockwell gave her far and away the highest contrast .
He does this partly by giving her a white dress , even though she probably was n’t wearing one at the time .
Whenever we illustrate actual events we have to balance accurate depiction of event with the needs of the picture .
Here I think the white dress serves several purposes , one of which is creating an area of high contrast that draws our eyes to Ruby first .
Ruby ’s white dress works with her dark skin to create the high contrast and to create the silhouette that all by itself communicates the idea of a walking African American schoolgirl .
Rather than painting her figure all with dark tones or all with light ones , he instead gives her the extremes of the values range .
Everything else appears in the mid-tones , including the marshals .
Ruby pops out of the painting at us because she ’s the most interesting thing in the painting values - wise .
Direction
I ’m not going to go into color palette and choices very much , but I do want to point out how Rockwell uses saturation .
If he makes Ruby the focus of the painting using values , he guides our eyes around the painting with saturation .
Here is the painting with the areas of high saturation highlighted .
Everything is greyscale except for the areas inside the ovals , which I left as they appear in the painting .
Look at the yellow armbands .
It may appear that I dropped the color out of the sleeves around them , but I did n’t .
Rockwell gave just a few well placed areas of intense color and kept everything else desaturated .
Now let ’s look at the path our eyes take around the picture .
My eye starts at A . Like I said before , this is the highest contrast place in the painting .
Not only that , it has a person ’s face , which also draws the attention .
Because of the interplay between Ruby ’s skin and the dress , as well as the edges formed by the marshal to the left , my eye travels down the figure and back up .
That completes a basic loop , and we may follow that several times .
Once we ’ve taken in Ruby herself , the values and contrast have done their job .
Now the color saturation takes over and we head into a widening spiral .
First up , we see the yellow marshal armbands at B .
See how they ’re arranged to keep our eye moving down and left ?
From B , we follow the marshal ’s figure down , with both the folds in the fabric and his leg position redirecting us from the left back to the right .
From C , we can either look back at Ruby again or continue across the painting to the trailing marshals .
Once that happens , we see the splattered tomato and the yellow marshal armband , both areas of high color saturation .
Once we ’re up at the armband , the splatter on the wall at D draws us back across the painting , to the racial slur , and to Ruby .
Composition
The colors , values , and composition of this painting are all simple .
They keep the picture clear so that Rockwell can focus on the real points of the painting : illustrating an event and attacking racism .
Just because these things are done simply , however , does n’t mean that they ’re done without thought and consideration .
Here is the golden section grid overlaid on the painting .
Where does Ruby appear ?
Sometimes artists use the golden section consciously and other times their natural sense of design leads them to it unconsciously .
Though not certain , I believe Rockwell used the ratio consciously , putting Ruby where he did because it ’s on the left golden section line .
One reason I say this is that the picture ’s aspect ratio itself is the golden ratio .
That is , the scan I used is 2000 pixels wide and 1481 pixels tall .
2600 / 1481 is 1.62 , the golden ratio .
Message and Symbolism
Symbolism pretty much has to smack me upside the head for me to notice it .
In The Problem We All Live With , I think ideas are pretty out in the open .
The use of the word “ nigger ” on the wall and the “ KKK ” to the left of the lead marshal clearly make this a painting about race and relations .
Not only do they set context , I believe they help us identify with Ruby .
She ’s the visual focus of the painting , and she ’s also the only person we can see all of .
It ’s natural to wonder what it must have been like to walk past those words – to have tomatoes thrown at us .
I take several points from the depiction of the marshals .
They ’re faceless ; representing an institution .
Yes , they ’re protecting her , but they also box her in .
Visually they frame her and define her space , just as they do conceptually .
In this painting it is the white people who both keep her safe and keep her in a box .
Personally , I like the fact that Rockwell does n’t treat the marshals as heroes .
Consider how in the movie Avatar it ’s the Na’vi who are oppressed by humans , but it ’s a white human who becomes the focus of the picture .
It would have been quite racist indeed to make the marshals the focus of the event instead of the girl .
The Elements
To wrap up we ’ll go through Lee Moyer ’s Elements of a Successful Illustration .
Focus : Ruby is the focus of the painting .
Rockwell uses values to make her so .
Composition and Design :
The painting is a golden rectangle , and Ruby is on the left golden section of that rectangle .
There are strong horizontals and verticals .
The simplicity of the composition serves the message .
Palette : Yellows and greys dominate with the tomato as a spot red .
Rockwell uses a few spots of high saturation to guide our eye .
Value : Ruby is the focus , and Rockwell does this by giving her the brightest and darkest values .
Everything else is a mid-tone .
Mass : Rockwell uses shading to define mass .
He also makes Ruby seem small in comparison to the marshals by contrasting their size .
Texture : I love the texture in the wall and the sidewalk particularly .
Symbolism :
As I said earlier , the white figures visually block Ruby in , both protecting her and constraining her at the same time .
Ruby is not the one with power here .
Micro / Macro : Rockwell keeps the details sparing but telling .
The tomato .
The graffiti .
The integration order in the lead marshal ’s pocket .
Ruby ’s schoolbooks .
There is no detail that does n’t add to the story .
Ornament :
There is no ornament for visual flair or style .
That would get in the way of the message , so Rockwell does n’t include it .
Narrative :
The painting depicts an actual event .
The details reinforce the narrative , but it carries extra resonance for people from the U.S .
Juxtaposition :
The immediate juxtaposition is Ruby ’s size as compared to the marshals .
There is also a contrast in the way Ruby is personalized while the marshals are depersonalized and represent institutions of both racism and attempts by the government to end racism .
Stylization : Rockwell goes realistic .
It ’s not quite as cartoony as some of his covers for the Saturday Evening Post , but it ’s recognizably his style .
Character :
We feel strong empathy for the girl , and we also admire her calm .
Tension :
The tomato , the graffiti , and the need for marshals in the first place all point to the tension of the situation .
Line : Rockwell uses clear , distinct edges .
Research / Reference :
This site shows several studies and sketches , as well as a girl posing as a model for the painting .
Vignette :
The vignette is simple and strong , and it supports the message .
Perspective : Perspective is the illusion of space and depth .
The lines of the sidewalk go to a common vanishing point , and the size and relationships of the figures also define the space .
Next week , we ’ll shift gears completely and look at a mirage by Boris .
BAGHDAD — Even with Iraqi security forces on a heightened state of alert in advance of Sunday ’s national elections , dozens of Iraqis were killed Wednesday in a devastating series of suicide bombings in the restive city of Baquba .
The attacks began with two car bombings near campaign offices and government buildings .
Then , as swarms of people rushed to a local hospital , ferrying the dead and wounded and looking for relatives , a man hiding a suicide belt under a dirty white robe entered the emergency room , a local policeman said .
An injured man at the hospital said he noticed the attacker just before the explosion .
“ Then I saw a huge flame crashing down on me , ” said the man , who gave his name only as Muhammad .
“ There was fire everywhere .
I passed out and was awakened by the wails of a woman weeping over an injured 7 - year - old boy .
There were bodies and blood everywhere .
It was horrific . ”
Grieving relatives screamed amid the rubble , calling out the names of loved ones even as security officers scrambled to lock down the entire city .
The attacks left at least 31 people dead and 55 wounded , according to local security officials .

US President Barack Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev have agreed a new nuclear arms reduction treaty after months of negotiations .
The treaty limits both sides to 1,550 warheads , about 30 % less than currently allowed , the White House said .
The deal replaces the 1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty .
The leaders will sign the pact in Prague on 8 April .
President Obama hailed the treaty as the most comprehensive weapons control agreement in nearly two decades .
" With this agreement , the United States and Russia - the two largest nuclear powers in the world - also send a clear signal that we intend to lead , " he said at the White House .
" By upholding our own commitments under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty , we strengthen our global efforts to stop the spread of these weapons , and to ensure that other nations meet their own responsibilities , " he said .
In Russia , President Medvedev 's spokeswoman told the Interfax news agency : " This treaty reflects the balance of interests of both nations . "
The treaty must be ratified by the US Senate and the Russian Duma .
New limits
In a speech in Prague last April , Mr Obama set out his vision of moving towards a world without nuclear weapons .
Both sides agreed to cut their arsenals last year , but disagreements on verification have held up a deal .
TREATY LIMITS Warheads : 1,550 ( 74 % lower than the 1991 Start Treaty and 30 % lower than the 2002 Moscow Treaty ) Launchers : 800 deployed and non-deployed launchers , and heavy bombers equipped for nuclear armaments Missiles : 700 deployed intercontinental and submarine - launched ballistic missiles , and deployed heavy bombers equipped for nuclear armaments
US - Russia deal ' marks new start ' ' Symbolic win ' for Medvedev Obama 's statement in full Global map of nuclear arsenals
The US is said to have more than 2,000 deployed strategic nuclear weapons , while Russia is believed to have more than 2,500 .
The new agreement - which came in a phone call between the two leaders - limits the US and Russia to a maximum of 1,550 deployed nuclear warheads each .
The cuts are substantial - well over 30 % for the Russians and around 25 % for the Americans , whose current arsenal is smaller , says BBC diplomatic correspondent James Robbins .
Both sides would have seven years after the treaty 's ratification to carry out the reduction in long - range nuclear warheads .
The agreement also calls for cutting by about half the missiles and bombers that carry the weapons to their targets .
It limits missile delivery vehicles to 800 deployed and non-deployed intercontinental ballistic missile launchers , submarine - launched ballistic missile launchers , and heavy bombers equipped for nuclear weapons .
The cap on deployed intercontinental ballistic missiles and submarine launched missiles is set at 700 , the White House said .
The agreement includes a new verification mechanism that will ensure the " irreversibility , verifiability and transparency " of the reduction process , Russia 's Itar - Tass news agency said .
Moral high ground
The pact establishes a " legally - binding " linkage between offensive weapons and missile defence systems , the Kremlin said in a statement , and " will demand the deployment of all strategic offensive weapons exclusively on national territories " .
ANALYSIS Jonathan Marcus , BBC diplomatic correspondent
This agreement marks a significant foreign policy breakthrough for President Barack Obama .
It is the first comprehensive deal on nuclear arms since the Start Treaty signed back in July 1991 .
The reductions in this new treaty sound significant , but they leave both sides still with many more weapons than they need to deter the other .
But it marks the first step in the US president 's ambitious arms control agenda .
The US - Russia deal sends an important signal ahead of a crucial meeting in May to review the nuclear non-proliferation treaty - the cornerstone of efforts to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons .
Both Washington and Moscow want to be seen to be reducing their nuclear arsenals - something non-nuclear nations demand if the whole non-proliferation regime is to work effectively .
Moscow has strongly opposed US plans to set up missile defences in Europe , and has insisted on explicit recognition of the link between offensive and defensive systems in any new strategic arms reduction pact .
The timing and symbolism of the deal are crucial , enabling both countries to claim some moral high ground going into next month 's Washington Summit on nuclear security , and the critical talks in May aimed at limiting the spread of nuclear weapons around the world , our correspondent says .
Presidents Obama and Medvedev hope the new deal will increase pressure on Iran , in particular , to abandon any ambition to develop nuclear weapons , he adds .
The agreement - called the Measures to Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms - replaces the Cold War-era Start treaty signed in 1991 and the Moscow Treaty signed in 2002 .
Both US and Russian officials expressed confidence that lawmakers would ratify the treaty .

GENEVA , SWITZERLAND — World Health Organization officials expressed disappointment Monday at the group 's finding that , despite the enormous efforts of doctors , rescue workers and other medical professionals worldwide , the global death rate remains constant at 100 percent .
Death rates since 1992

Death , a metabolic affliction causing total shutdown of all life functions , has long been considered humanity 's number one health concern .
Responsible for 100 percent of all recorded fatalities worldwide , the condition has no cure .
" I was really hoping , what with all those new radiology treatments , rescue helicopters , aerobics TV shows and what have you , that we might at least make a dent in it this year , " WHO Director General Dr. Gernst Bladt said .
" Unfortunately , it would appear that the death rate remains constant and total , as it has inviolably since the dawn of time . "

Many are suggesting that the high mortality rate represents a massive failure on the part of the planet 's health care workers .
" The inability of doctors and scientists to adequately address this issue of death is nothing less than a scandal , " concerned parent Marcia Gretto said .
" Do you have any idea what a full - blown case of death looks like ?
Well , I do , and believe me , it 's not pretty .
In prolonged cases , total decomposition of the corpse is the result . "

" What about the children ? " the visibly moved Gretto added .
" At this early date , I do n't want to start making broad generalizations , " Citizens for Safety 's Robert Hemmlin said , " but it is beginning to seem possible that birth — as well as the subsequent life cycle that follows it — may be a serious safety risk for all those involved . "

Death , experts say , affects not only the dead , but the non -dead as well .
Death has long been considered humanity 's number one health concern .
Responsible for 100 percent of all recorded fatalities worldwide , the condition has no cure .

" Those who suffer from death can be highly traumatized by it , often so severely that it kills them , " noted therapist Eli Wasserbaum said .
" But it can also be very traumatic for the still - living who are left behind .
The sudden cessation of metabolic activity characteristic of terminal cases of death often leaves the dead person in a position where they are unable to adequately provide for the emotional needs of their loved ones . "
In the most serious cases of death , Wasserbaum explained , the trauma inflicted upon these still - living victims of death may continue throughout their entire lives , until their own deaths .
" Thus , " Wasserbaum said , " the ' vicious cycle ' of death trauma continues indefinitely . "

" Everybody talks about death , " Sen . Pete Domenici ( R - NM ) said , " but nobody seems to actually be doing anything about it .
I propose we stop molly - coddling death , not to mention the multi-billion - dollar hospital , mortuary , funeral and burial industries that reap huge profits from it . "
Under Domenici's new bill , all federal funds will be withheld from the medical industry until it " gets serious and starts cracking down on death . "

Consumer rights advocate and staunch anti-death activist Ralph Nader agreed with Domenici .
" Why should we continue to spend billions of dollars a year on a health care industry whose sole purpose is to prevent death , only to find , once again , that death awaits us all ? "
Nader said in an impassioned address to several suburban Californians .
" That 's called a zero percent return on our investment , and that 's not fair .
Its time the paying customer stood up to the HMOs and to the so - called ' medical health professionals ' and said : ' Enough is enough .
I 'm paying through the nose here , and I do n't want to die . ' "

The race to fill the state Senate seat vacated by new US Senator Scott Brown is shaping up to be a four - person contest .
The latest candidate to raise his hand is Richard Mitchell , a 47 - year - old computer engineer at EMC who moved from Sherborn to Natick in 2007 .
He said he is running to advocate for fathers ’ rights .
“ I ’ve gone through the family and probate court system and it ’s a compete mess and something has to be done about it , ’’ he said in a phone interview yesterday .
“ That is the single reason why I ’m running . ’’
He is a registered independent , and this is his first time seeking political office .
Candidates who had previously announced are state Representative Lida Harkins , a Needham Democrat ; state Representative Richard Ross , a Wrentham Republican ; and Peter Smulowitz , a Needham physician and a Democrat who will face off against Harkins in the primary .
Before yesterday ’s 5 p.m. deadline for submitting paperwork to local election authorities , all four candidates had filed voters ’ signatures with town clerk offices .
Clerks , or other election authorities , must certify at least 300 signatures from registered voters for each candidate .
The candidates have until 5 p.m. March 9 to submit the certified signatures to the state Elections Division .
The state primary date is April 13 , and the election is May 11 .
The Norfolk , Bristol , and Middlesex state Senate seat represents Millis , Needham , Norfolk , North Attleborough , Plainville , Sherborn , Wayland , and Wrentham as well as parts of Attleboro , Franklin , Natick , and Wellesley .
Harkins , who is 66 , was first elected state representative in 1988 , and has served as majority whip and as chair of the Joint Committee on Education , Arts , and the Humanities ; the Joint Committee on Housing and Urban Development ; and the House Committee on Science and Technology .
Ross , 55 , succeeded Brown as Wrentham selectman and then as state representative , an office Ross has held since 2005 .
Ross , who runs a funeral home , has made health care a key issue , saying that the new state mandate on health coverage is too tough on small businesses .
Smulowitz , a 33 - year - old emergency room physician at Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital - Needham and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center , is pledging a fresh perspective .
He was a founding member of Needham for Barack Obama and is a member of Needham Town Meeting .

Researchers at the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center have figured out how ATP is broken down in cells , providing for the first time a clear picture of the key reaction that allows cells in all living things to function and flourish .
Discovered some 80 years ago , adenosine triphosphate is said to be second in biological importance only to DNA .
Each cell in the human body contains about a billion ATP molecules , and the power derived from the breakdown of them is used to deliver substances to their cellular homes , build needed complex molecules and even make muscles contract .
" ATP is the fuel of life .
It 's an energy currency molecule -- the most important source of chemical and mechanical energy in living systems , " explains Sunyoung Kim , the associate professor who oversaw the research published Feb. 19 in the Journal of Biological Chemistry .
Scientists for decades have worked to understand the critically important reaction but , until now , did not know how proteins in a cell extract and use the energy from ATP .
In its original form , an ATP molecule has three phosphate groups .
While it has been known for some time that , for ATP breakdown to occur , the third phosphate group must be attacked by a hydroxide , or a water molecule that has lost one of its protons , it was unknown what actually stripped away that proton , allowing the release of ATP 's stores .
The team chose to investigate one particular family of protein machines that break down ATP -- the kinesins .

Kinesins are tiny biological machines that work a lot like car engines , Kim says , travelling up and down cellular roadways in support of several functions , such as cellular division and cargo transport .
" We picked kinesins because they 're the simplest known motor proteins .
Usually , proteins that break down ATP are very large and have a lot of moving parts for mechanical work . "
Kim says .
" The simpler and the smaller the system is , the more likely you can capture information about it in detail . "
The team narrowed its study further to the human kinesin Eg5 , which is essential for cell division -- normal and abnormal -- and is touted as an attractive target for next - generation cancer drugs .
Inhibition of Eg5 kinesin , by disrupting its ability to break down ATP , may be able to block cancer progression , and a number of Eg5 inhibitors are in clinical trials .
To get a clear picture of how the kinesin and ATP interact , the team set out to use X - ray crystallography to develop a three - dimensional structure that would detail all the bonds and atomic contacts , explains assistant professor David Worthylake , one of the co-authors .
The challenge , though , was trapping the protein in the middle of the energy - releasing chain of events by coaxing it to hold onto a chemical mimic of ATP , in which the final phosphate cannot be removed as usual , and examining the " jammed " protein up close .
advertisement
According to Courtney Parke , a graduate student and the first author of the team 's paper , successfully trapping an ATP mimic is quite difficult .
Before her team achieved it , only three other attempts had been successful .
Still , all those successes were a bit unsatisfying , she says , because they did n't show how that first step in ATP breakdown occurred .
Further complicating matters , purified kinesin proteins typically are found bound to product of ATP breakdown , adenosine diphosphate , or ADP .
" We said , ` You know what ?
We do n't think that you can just insert the mimic of ATP into this purified protein with ADP already bound to it .
We think ADP has to be taken out first .
That 's what the protein does naturally , ' " Kim says .
" So , instead of forcing the protein out of its normal sequence of steps in breaking down ATP , we pulled out the ADP first and then asked the Eg5 kinesin to bind the ATP mimic .
And , lo and behold , we got the answer . "
The surprising result was that the protein uses a string of water molecules to harness the energy of the reaction .
" Conventional wisdom pointed toward the reactive agent that starts the ATP breakdown process as being something in the protein , such as an amino acid , " notes Edward Wojcik , an assistant professor and another co-author on the paper .
But , it was n't an amino acid at all :
It was a second water molecule that pulled the proton off the first water molecule .
" Each of these water molecules is attached to different part of the protein .
And , normally , they hold tightly to each other as well , keeping two very distant parts of the protein connected by a molecular bridge , " Kim explains .
" Our data show , when the second water molecule takes the proton from the first one , the proton is transferred across this bridge .
This causes the two different parts of the protein that the bridge holds together to unfurl , and you have motion in the protein . "
That internal motion propels the nanomachine along its assigned roadway , allowing it to do its assigned duties .
" For such a relatively simple molecule , water still has some tricks to teach us , and I am still amazed that we found it to play such a pivotal role in the motor protein machinery , " Wojcik says .
The team hopes that , with a clearer understanding of how these biological machines work , scientists will better understand how and why things are moved around inside cells , allowing them to figure out how to turn things on and off at will with novel drugs to help combat diseases .
" We believe many , if not all , proteins that use the energy from ATP breakdown may work the same way , " Kim says .
The project was supported by funding from the Louisiana Board of Regents and from the National Institutes of Health .
By being named a " Paper of the Week " by the Journal of Biological Chemistry , the team 's article has been categorized in the top 1 percent of papers reviewed by the editorial board in terms of significance and overall importance .
It also has been named a " Must Read " by the Faculty of 1000 Biology , an online research service that reviews the most interesting papers published in the biological sciences , based on the recommendations of leading researchers .

Second coming of Jesus causes anti-Christianity movement
March 27 , 2510
A much - awaited comeback by our Lord and Savior is n’t quite having its intended effect .
Not long after returning to earth and attempting to bring back what he calls “ Real Christianity , ” religious leader and God Jesus Christ is finding very few converts to his new reform movement , and plenty of “ aborted ” Christians seeking better alternatives to the Lord .
“ The plan seemed to make sense at the time , ” remarked Jesus .
“ Come back , prove that you ’re God , clear up some misunderstandings , and maybe add a new New Testament .
But it ’s starting to seem like old times all over again . ”
A recent poll funded by Jesus himself seems to be pointing in that direction , as a whopping 96 % of the population believes Jesus is God but wants absolutely nothing to do with him , 94 % want him to go back to Heaven and leave us alone , and 18 % “ would n’t be upset ” if he were crucified again .
“ Christianity was pretty cool before Jesus came back , ” remarked Christian unconvert Canaanite Baal , formerly known as Paul Cross .
“ I mean , it did n’t take itself so seriously , and it managed to make religion fun and entertaining .
But the real Jesus is n't really what I 'm looking for in a religious leader .
I mean , he 's a guy who thinks Christmas is too unbiblical and commerical , plus , he 's also trying to ban Mixed Martial Arts .
The guy pretty much ruined a religion that had a successful 2500 year run without him . ”
“ I think the guy ’s a couple of sticks short of a crucifix , ” added atheist fundamentalist Rational Godless .
“ And I do n’t care what he says — he ’s not God .
Yes -- he had a second coming .
But , I mean , if Nature can add energy to old soup and create life , it can also bring back a 2500 year old dead man who probably never even existed in the first place . ”
Even Father Paul Mark Nazarene , one of the few people who have supported Jesus since his return to earth , is critical of some of his beliefs .
“ I think he ’s taking the Bible way too literally .
I mean , he really wants people to give up their possessions , and walk an extra mile with some guy , and follow the 613 Old Testament Laws .
The results of a worldwide Apostle search also seem to be echoing that sentiment , as many were called , but only four showed up .
“ Four apostles ! ? ” said Jesus via his “ jc_equals_gd ” Twitter account .
“ I have four Apostles , and 87,000 Twitter followers .
As for Justin Beiber , he has 23 million Twitter followers and 154 apostles . "
The Second Coming has also caused church attendance to plummet , and forced clergy members to abandon their core focus .
“ Jesus wants to bring an end to a $ 300 zillion a year industry , ” said Deacon James Johnson of the First Tammy Faye Pentecostal Church .
“ I mean , he ’s telling everyone to go home and pray in closets , because that 's what it says in the Bible He 's anti-church .
But as God as my witness , the Church will survive — with or without Jesus . ”
The Catholic Church — now know as the Alternative to Christ Church — has already added Jesus to its heretics list , and is scrambling to disassociate itself from its longtime Lord and Savior .
A special council is still working out the details of the soon to be released New and Improved New Testament , which — according to rumors — will be centered around country music legend Kenny Rogers .
" We ’ve been doing this for 2500 years , " said the Pope .
" We know exactly what it takes to run a successful religion . ”
Even the Bushes , longtime supporters of all things Christ , are rushing to join the anti-Jesus crowd .
“ Jesus is almost as bad as a Communist Islamic fundamentalist North Korean Cuban Soviet homosexual , ” said former IDA webmaster George HHHWW Bush .
“ He ’s against capitalism , free speech , and family — and as far as I ’m concerned , that means he ’s against America .
And if you ’re against America , you ’re against God — even if you happen to be God .
We also have good reason to believe he ’s been developing WMDs . ”
And Mel Gibson XVI , director of last year ’s blockbuster hits The Second Coming and What Christ Wants , is leading a revolt against the man and God he once worshiped and promoted .
“ Aye — fight him , and you may burn in hell , ” said the forty time Oscar winner after a forty minute and forty second forty ounce malt liquor drinking binge .
“ Follow him , and you may live .
Maybe even forever .
But when you ’re playing Yahtzee in Heaven five hundred years from now , you ’ll be willing to trade all of your days , from this day to that , for one chance , just one chance , to come back here and tell Jesus that he may take our afterlives , but he ’ll never take ... our freedom ! ”
Jesus was hoping to gain some popularity with last night ’s Jesus Live — a miracle - filled TV extravaganza that aired on 433,234,758 of the world ’s 856,784,212 TV channels — but his Apostle count remained unchanged at four , and it seems like Christ will need more than a miracle to win over the public .
“ OK — most of those feats were impressive , ” said viewer David Beelzeblaine , “ I ’ll give him that .
But the guy ’s not even healing people anymore .
He ’s just turning bread into more bread , and water into wine .
I mean , that did n’t get him very far back then — and magic really is n’t that hot nowadays . ”
“ I figured my comeback would cost us a few members , ” Jesus remarked , “ but I was hoping we ’d gain a few hundred billion more .
I ca n’t say I ’m entirely surprised , though .
Ezekiel , Isaiah , and Jeremiah mentioned something about the Son of Man being rejected and persecuted .
I was hoping they were just drunk and talking out of their asses , or that maybe they were referring to some other Son of Man — but I guess they meant me .
“ To be honest , I ’m starting to rethink this whole reform thing .
I mean , doing my Father ’s will is great and all — but I ’d rather have my billions of followers back . ”
5e speculative background images
This is the fifth of five quick posts about some browser quirks that have come up in the last few weeks .
Chrome and Safari start downloading background images before all styles are available .
If a background image style gets overwritten this may cause wasteful downloads .
Background images are used everywhere : buttons , background wallpaper , rounded corners , etc .
You specify a background image in CSS like so :
. bgimage { background - image : url ( " /images/button1.gif " ) ; }
Downloading resources is an area for optimizing performance , so it ’s important to understand what causes CSS background images to get downloaded .
See if you can answer the following questions about button1.gif :
Suppose no elements in the page use the class “ bgimage ” .
Is button1.gif downloaded ?
Suppose an element in the page has the class “ bgimage ” but also has “ display : none ” or “ visibility : hidden ” .
Is button1.gif downloaded ?
Suppose later in the page a stylesheet gets downloaded and redefines the “ bgimage ” class like this : . bgimage { background - image : url ( " /images/button2.gif " ) ; } Is button1.gif downloaded ?
Ready ?
The answer to question # 1 is “ no ” .
If no elements in the page use the rule , then the background image is not downloaded .
This is true in all browsers that I ’ve tested .
The answer to question # 2 is “ depends on the browser ” .
This might be surprising .
Firefox 3.6 and Opera 10.10 do not download button1.gif , but the background image is downloaded in IE 8 , Safari 4 , and Chrome 4 .
I do n’t have an explanation for this , but I do have a test page : hidden background images .
If you have elements with background images that are hidden initially , you should hold off on creating them until after the visible content in the page is rendered .
The answer to question # 3 is “ depends on the browser ” .
I find this to be the most interesting behavior to investigate .
According to the cascading behavior of CSS , the latter definition of the “ bgimage ” class should cause the background - image style to use button2.gif .
And in all the major browsers this is exactly what happens .
But Safari 4 and Chrome 4 are a little more aggressive about fetching background images .
They download button1.gif on the speculation that the background - image property wo n’t be overwritten , and then later download button2.gif when it is overwritten .
Here ’s the test page : speculative background images .
When my officemate , Steve Lamm , pointed out this behavior to me , my first reaction was “ that ’s wasteful ! ” I love prefetching , but I ’m not a big fan of most prefetching implementations because they ’re too aggressive – they err too far on the side of downloading resources that never get used .
After my initial reaction , I thought about this some more .
How frequently would this speculative background image downloading be wasteful ?
I went on a search and could n’t find any popular web site that overwrote the background - image style .
Not one .
I ’m not saying pages like this do n’t exist , I ’m just saying it ’s very atypical .
On the other hand , this speculative downloading of background images can really help performance and the user ’s perception of page speed .
Many web sites have multiple stylesheets .
If background images do n’t start downloading until all stylesheets are done loading , the page takes longer to render .
Safari and Chrome ’s behavior of downloading a background image as soon as an element needs it , even if one or more stylesheets are still downloading , is a nice performance optimization .
That ’s a nice way to finish the week .

Senator Conroy said international press advocacy group Reporters Without Borders had been " seriously misled " by the EFA in its decision to put Australia at the top of its ' Internet Enemies ' list .
The Reporters without Borders report said Australia needed to be watched closely to ensure its internet freedoms were not infringed by the proposed filter .
Other countries on the Reporters Without Borders list include United Arab Emirates , Bahrain , Belarus , and Turkey , among others .
But Senator Conroy said the group had been misled , and appeared to lay the blame with the EFA .
" Reporters Without Borders have been seriously misled , much like many people in this chamber , about what the government is actually proposing , " Senator Conroy said .
" It is wrong in both the facts about what the government is proposing and it is wrong in terms of its comparison with other countries . "
The report 's implication that Government was trying to block " unwanted " content - and not the defined Refused Classification content that is the object of the policy - was wrong and misinformed , Senator Conroy said .
Responding to a question from Queenland Liberal senator Sue Boyce , he flatly denied that he had ever implied opponents of the internet filter were supporters of child pornography , and railed at the EFA for making the suggestion .
" The material that has been supplied to Reporters Without Borders comes from Electronic Frontiers Australia , who have been challenged publicly on a number of occasions to produce a quote where I have ever said that , " Senator Conroy told the Senate today .
" After six months , they have been unwilling to provide one quote , " he said .
" I challenge each and every one of you to come up with such a quote , because it does not exist .
Electronic Frontiers Australia have ( run ) one of the most disgraceful misinformation campaigns and have misled Australians . "
Senator Conroy said the Refused Classification material targeted by the filter could not be distributed through books , on TV , cinemas or DVD - a ban that is supported by " each and everyone in this chamber . "
" But apparently this new distribution platform otherwise known as the Internet should be something sacred .
It should not have to play by the rules of Australia , " Senator Conroy said .

Major General , Commanding The Story
Of the 1st Infantry Division D- DAY WAS " PURE MIRACLE " O N April 22 , 1944 , General Field Marshal Erwin Rommel issued an order to all troops defending Western Europe : " We must succeed in the short time left until the offensive starts , in bringing all defenses to such a standard that they will hold up against the strongest attack .
Never in history was there a defense of such an extent , with such as obstacle as the sea .
The enemy must be annihilated before he reaches our main battle field ! "
N April 22 , 1944 , General Field Marshal Erwin Rommel issued an order to all troops defending Western Europe : " We must succeed in the short time left until the offensive starts , in bringing all defenses to such a standard that theywill hold up against the strongest attack .
Never in history was there a defense of such an extent , with such as obstacle as the sea .
The enemy must be annihilated before he reaches our main battle field ! "
Along the strip of coast near Colleville - sur - Mer , Normandy , France , Der Fuehrer 's chain gang boys , the Todt workers , must have smiled confidently when they read the order .
If the Allies struck here , they also would strike sharpened stakes , ramp obstacles , steel " Element C " obstacles , " hedgehogs , " tetrahedra and curved rails .
They would be blown to bits by floating mines , wired mines , mines buried in light sand and gravel .
If infantry managed to smash through , it would find itself on a beach flat as a billiard table except for a two - foot embankment on the land side where the pebbly shale met the turf .
In front would be a double - apron wire , concertinas and knife - rests criss - crossing carefully laid mine fields .
It also would find itself facing a 100 - foot cliff harboring sunken concrete pillboxes .
From them , 57 mm and 75 mm anti-tank guns and 20 mm machine guns would pour enfilading fire up and down the beach area .
Defiladed behind the ridge were mortars .
Manning the defenses at all times was at least a battalion and a half of seasoned infantrymen .
In reserve were three full regiments , a mobile brigade and three mobile battalions .
The commander of the 1st Inf. Div. , the unit selected to land here , knew all this .
He also knew that in the Cerisy Forest , 15 miles to the rear , the 352nd Inf. Div. was on the alert as a reserve .
What he did n't know was that two days before June 6 , 1944 , the greater part of this enemy division had bivouacked in the Colleville beach area for anti-invasion maneuvers .
M ANY accounts have been written of the June 6 assault on the West Wall , and stories will continue to flow long after the D - Day tumult has died away .
But it was of the 1st Div. landings that Ernie Pyle spoke when he said , " Now that it is over it seems to me a pure miracle that we ever took the beach at all . "

A few of the early assault waves , having gained the dubious shelter of the shale ledge , were riddled by artillery bursts .
Most supporting weapons were swamped or destroyed on the beach .
It would be futile to minimize the destruction or deny the disorganization .
It was hell !
There was confusion , yes .
Many units had 30 per cent casualties in the first hour of fighting .
Assault boats , mined and shelled , piled upon obstacles and formed additional obstructions .
Men were cut down as their landing craftdropped the ramp or died wading through the surf .

But what is significant is that the division came through the interlaced system of obstacles to destroy the entire German 352nd Inf.
Div. and it pushed ahead until ordered to stop .
The 1st came through on knowledge based on experience , on planning and guts .
The sea - borne invasion of the continent started June 6 .
When the 2nd and 3rd Bns. of the 16th Combat Team debarked from transports to landing craft at 0630 they assaulted Omaha Beach north of Colleville - sur - Mer .
The men knew it was n't going to be easy when they saw the pattern of flying metal at the water 's edge , heard the whoom !
whoom ! of 88s , and the crack of automatic guns .
The haze of drifting cordite smoke already partly obscured the beach .
Leading the assault , the 2nd Bn. was pinned down on the beach by furious fire from those fortifications which had withstood severe naval and air bombardment .
The 3rd Bn. landed on the left of the beach and , disregarding mortars arid machine guns , fought inland up a deep draw , destroying strongpoints as it went along .
The 1st Bn , landed behind the immobilized 2nd .
Reorganization of the scattered and riddled units was accomplished under continued heavy fire .
Meanwhile , casualties continued to mount .
It was at this critical moment that Brig Gen George A. Taylor , assistant division commander , then Colonel in command of the 18th Inf. Regt. , expressed the too - dogged - to - quit spirit saying , " Hell , we 're dying here on the beach .
Let 's move inland and die . "
O NE group of the 1st Bn. blasted a gap in the wire : what was left of the unit crawled through minefields to capture the ridgeline overlooking the beach .
The 1st and 2nd Bns. cleared Colleville - sur - Mer .
Behind this driving point the division picked itself up from the sand and surged inland , still meeting stubborn resistance from the outnumbering Germans .

When elements of the 7th FA Bn. landed at H - Hour , half of its guns had been destroyed .
Eight hours later it fired its first mission .
In the meantime , men grabbed their rifles and fought with the infantry .
At 1300 the 18th Combat Team landed .
By mid-afternoon the 2nd Bn. of the 18th was in Colleville - sur - Mer. Firing batteries of the 32nd FA Bn. went into position at 2045 , although 25 vehicles and two guns had been lost in the surf .
The 26th Combat Team came in at 1700 through mortar and artillery shells still showering the beach .
The 1st and 2nd Bns. were abreast with the 3rd in reserve .
Despite heavy losses , the 3rd Bn. was the first unit of the division to take its Army objective .
During the next week the 1st Div. slashed inland 23 miles to Caumont , making the farthest southern penetration of the beachhead , and halting only to allow friendly units to draw abreast and cover its dangerously exposed flanks .
Other units never did pull onto line ; for one month the division held its narrow salient .
On June 21 Field Marshal Bernard L. Montgomery complimented Maj. Gen. C. R. Huebner , stating that the action of the division in seizing and holding Caumont so upset the Germans ' plans that it was necessary for them to alter their prepared plans and commit their hoarded counter - attack forces .
The first phase of the offensive had ended with the destruction of one German division and disruption of all elements initially opposing the assault .
On July 2 , when Gen . Dwight D Eisenhower presented decorations to men who made the initial assault , he said , " I know your record from the day you landed in Africa , then Sicily .
I am beginning to think that the 1st Div. is a sort of Praetorian Guard ... "

In the last war it was the first to fire a shell against the foe , first to suffer casualties , first to capture prisoners , first to repel a German raid , first to stage a major American offensive , first to enter Germany and cross the Rhine .
It was the first division to be cited in General Orders .
It was the last division to return to America after Germany 's occupation had been completed .
Allen , its fighting commander through three decisive campaigns , once said , " Nothing in hell must stop the 1st Division . "
Nothing has .
During World War II it was the first infantry division to arrive in England , first to invade North Africa , Sicily and France , and first to smash through the supposedly impregnable fortifications of the Siegfried Line .
Maj.
Gen. TerryAllen , its fighting commander through three decisive campaigns , once said , " Nothing in hell must stop the 1st Division . "
Nothing has .
The insignia carries a past which symbolizes the spirit of these fighting doughboys .
At the battle of Soissons in World War I , a 1st Div. man cut a piece of red cloth from the cap of an enemy he had killed , pinned it to his sleeve .
A comment that it looked like red flannels showing through a torn coat brought the present more compact design .
R EGIMENTS which stormed into France that June day had previously taken many bitterly - held objectives .
The 16th Inf. , organized in 1798 , fought its way through the War of 1812 , Mexican War , Civil War , Indian insurrection , Philippine uprising , Mexican border incidents , World War I and since Nov. 8 , 1942 , World War II .

The 18th Inf. Regt. first appeared in the War of 1812 .
On May 4 , 1881 , by direction of Pres. Lincoln , it was reorganized to participate in the Civil War .
Afterwards it was identified in numerous Indian skirmishes leading to the conquest and settlement of the American frontier .
In the Philippines it marched against Insurrectionists and Moro headhunters , and , following the Spanish - American War , served tours of duty there .
The 26th Inf. Regt. arrived in Manila , March 18 , 1901 , and fought Philippine Insurgents until order was restored .
The regiment was recalled to the U.S. , July 15 , 1903 , for duty along the Mexican border .
Again , on May 28 , 1907 , it sailed for the Philippines , serving a tour of duty there until its return to the States on June 15 , 1909 .
Stationed in Michigan until 1913 , it was afterward posted to Texas , where it patrolled the Mexican border until war was declared against Germany .
The call to arms came to the newly - formed 1st Inf. Div. on June 3 , 1917 .
Among the original members were men from every state of the Union , and others from Alaska , Hawaii , Guam , the Philippines , Panama Canal Zone and Puerto Rico .
Landing at St. Nazaire , France , June 26 , the division began intensive training for battle .
On Oct. 21 , it entered a quiet sector of the lines on the Lorraine front between Luneville and Nancy for its first experience in actual warfare .
After 30 days of typical trench fighting , it was relieved for an additional period of training .
On Jan. 18 , 1918 , it entered the lines again , this time relieving the French Army 's 1st Moroccan Div. and occupying a sector from Bouconville to Seichprey during three terrible winter months .
The division took and held Cantigny against repeated savage counter - attacks .
This was a hard - won victory and important in that it marked a turning point in the conduct of the war , from defense to attack .
Relief of the division was completed July 8 , after 72 days in the line .
Five days later the men were again in the front lines , this time in the Marne salient .
From July 18 to 23 , they overcame the strongest resistance the enemy could offer and succeeded in cutting the main supply route of the salient .
At Soissons , the division took its objective only after casualties had reached a desperate total .
Two companies were wiped out , and the 2nd Bn. came out of action commanded by a sergeant .
The next offensive began on the heels of the previous one : reduction of the St. Mihiel salient .
On Oct. 4 , the Meuse - Argonne offensive got under way .
During one phase , the division marched and fought for 55 hours without rest or sleep , and the 18th Inf. covered a distance of 71 kilometers .
At the Armistice the division was at Sedan , farthest American penetration of the war .
Gen. John J. Pershing cited the 1st as " never broken by hardship or battle . "
Marshal Foch conferred upon many of its units the Fourragere .
Today men still wear the red and green shoulder piping of the award .
L ATE Nov. 7 , 1942 , 22 ships , part of the Center Task Force , Operation " Torch , " swung into position near Oran to disembark troops .
Operation " Torch " was the joint invasion of North Africa by British and American troops .
For 1st Div. men , it was a baptism of fire .
For them it was more than a trial ; they were the vanguard of a new American Army .

For 1st Div. men , it was a baptism of fire .
For them it was more than a trial ; they were the vanguard of a new American Army .
Volunteers and regular army men , they were eager for the job ahead .
Combat was a new experience but they had been prepared by two years of intensive maneuvers at home , in England and Scotland .
Training of the division had begun with its consolidation at Ft. Doyens , Mass. , early in 1941 .
It had the same pride and long traditions as the old outfit , but it had been shaken down for speed and stamina .
The 28th Inf. had been cut away and supporting units had been trimmed to a close - knit , hard - hitting organization .
Division artillery was reduced to four battalions , the 5th , 7th , 32nd and 33rd .
The 5th FA Bn. was the oldest outfit in the division , tracing its history back to 1776 , when Capt .
Alexander Hamilton formed what is known today as Btry . " D , " 5th FA Bn .
The battery was then called " The Provincial Company of the Artillery of the Colony of New York . "
The first round ever fired in defense of the United States blazed from Hamilton 's guns July 12 , 1776 , at Ft. George , N. Y .
The last round of the Revolution also was fired by this battery .
One of the most memorable occasions of the war was the battery 's crossing of the Delaware with Gen. George Washington , Dec. 25 , 1776 .
At the close of the war , it was stationed at West Point .
Its complement of 40 comprised the entire American Army .
participated in the Indian , Mexican , Civil , and Spanish - American Wars , and the Philippine Insurrection .
In 1916 , it was selected as part of the 1st FA Brigade to serve with the newly - activated 1st Div .
The first American shells to land on German positions in World War I were fired from its guns on Oct. 25 , 1917 .
In 1861 , the battalion was reorganized under the name of the 5th U.S. Artillery Regt . and during the ensuing years , itparticipated in the Indian , Mexican , Civil , and Spanish - American Wars , and the Philippine Insurrection .
In 1916 , it was selected as part of the 1st FA Brigade to serve with the newly - activated 1st Div .

T HE division spent the winter of 1941 loading and landing on beaches near Buzzards Bay , Mass. , New River , N.C. , and in Puerto Rico .
Units of the 16th and 18th made landings near Martinique .
The following summer , landing operations were practiced at Onslo Beach , N.C. , and in the autumn all units participated in First Army North Carolina maneuvers , After Pearl Harbor , training was intensified .
In February the division moved to Camp Blanding , Fla. , and later to Ft. Benning , Ga. On June 21 , at Indiantown Cap Military Reservation , Pa. , came the order , " Prepare for overseas movement . "

The division sailed from New York , Aug. 2 , 1942 , crossed the Atlantic unescorted , landed in Scotland on Aug. 7 , and entrained immediately for Tidworth Barracks , England .
There ensued a concentrated period of maneuvers , including more amphibious training near Glasgow .
By Oct. 16 , all personnel had been loaded on ships to be used in the projected invasion .
There was one more landing operation , on Oct. 18 and 19 .
By the 26th the convoy was headed out to sea .
Operation " Torch " had begun .
I NDIANTOWN Gap , Tidworth and Glasgow were far away at 0100 Nov. 8 .
This was the real thing and as the boys came in low under artillery shells , machine gun tracers , and small arms fire , their motions became automatic reflexes : organize — spread out — stay down — move ahead .....
By morning the African beach had been taken , and the baptism was over .

By morning the African beach had been taken , and the baptism was over .
Combat Teams 16 and 18 , commanded by Maj. Gen. Terry Allen , landed near Arzew , east of Oran , at 0057 and 0105 , Nov. 8 . La Macta and Port-aux - Poules fell , St. Cloud was invested and contained ; the teams advanced west to Oran .
Simultaneously , Combat Team 26 , commanded by Brig .
Gen .
Theodore Roosevelt , came ashore at Les Andalouses , captured Bon Sfer and Ferme Combier , and pushed east to take the heights of Djebel Murdjadjo , dominating Oran .
The city fell Nov. 10 and the campaign was over the next day .
The initial landing operations successful , the division underwent intensive training near Oran , and from Nov. 19 to Jan. 15 , Combat Teams 18 and 26 operated under various French and British commands in Algeria and Tunisia .
While on detached service near Medjez El Bab , the 1st Bn. of the 18th Inf. made its famous assault on Long Stop Hill , Christmas Day .
Combat Team 18 remained in the lines 48 days , then shifted immediately to Sbiba to stem a German breakthrough .
Combat Team 26 was broken into groups , fighting in Central Tunisia near the Kairovan and Faid passes and in Ousseltia Valley .
Combat Team 16 went into training and garrison duties until Jan. 24 , when it went into action around Siliana .
Units remaining under division command were chiefly occupied with holding operations in the Ousseltia Valley from Jan. 16 to Feb. 19 .
A withdrawal and move to Kasserine Pass was ordered Feb. 19 .
Mid-February a strong German attack had developed near Faid Pass .
Enemy forces , after overrunning American positions at Sidi Bou Zid , split into three columns and continued to snake to Sbeitla , Feriana and Kasserine .
By Feb. 18 , leading elements of the German force had overrun Sbeitla , arriving in the vicinity of Kasserine .
Next day a savage attack developed from Kasserine toward Thala .
Down the long valley came tanks of Rommel 's 21st Panzer Div. , overrunning forward positions of the 26th Inf. and forcing a withdrawal westward .
Aided by rain and fog , Germans infiltrated through the Pass and continued northwest .
But their sands were running out .
Combat Team 16 and Combat Command " B " of the 1st Armored Div. counter - attacked and forced the enemy to retire through the Pass .
Africa : Battle without Letup SECOND STRIKE AGAINST ROMMEL T HE first strike had been called on Rommel .
The second followed March 17 .
For the first time since Oran , the units were brought together under division control .
After a spectacular 40 - mile night move , the 16th and 18th Combat Teams launched an attack which engulfed Gafsa and the territory around Feriana .
The 26th pushed on toward El Guettar , in the face of full - scale counter - attacks and continuous aerial bombardment .

El Guettar was attacked March 21 after the 26th Inf. with the 1st Ranger Bn. and Co. " D " ( Provisional ) , 1st Engr .
Combat
Bn , attached , marched 10 miles over rugged mountain terrain to occupy a covering position previous to the attack .
At 0300 , Combat Team 18 was in attack position with the 1st Bn. , 26th Inf. , alongside .
The assault was a complete success .
Commanding high ground was taken , 700 prisoners were captured .
The division sustained four attacks from German 10th Panzer Div. March 23 .
Although two battalions were cut off and German tanks were between the 18th Inf. CP and the 5th and 32nd FA Bns. positions , the infantry clung to its position .
One battery of the 5th FA Bn. was cut off , six howitzers were put out of action .
All guns of Cos. B and C , 601st TD Bn. and seven M - 10s of the 899th TD Bn. were lost .
Thirty , possibly 40 , enemy tanks were knocked out .
From March 26 to April 14 , advances continued over difficult mountainous terrain .
Strike two spoiled Rommel 's hopes of cutting Allied supply lines , forced him to continue his retreat northwest .
Marshal Montgomery 's Army was cracking the Mareth Line , and the British near Tunis had a stranglehold on Gen. Von Arnim .
The end came quickly .
On May 7 , the day the division was relieved , tattered remnants of Rommel 's desert fighters filed down from Cap Bon Peninsula .
The Afrika Korps was no more .
The time was ripe for a combined third strike by all Allied units .
The 1st Div. shifted north to Beja and went into battle near Mateur , April 19 .
The attack was aimed at Mateur and launched over broken , rocky hills which tore shoes and clothing .
Hill 523 was taken by the 16th Inf.s direct assault in one of the dirtiest , bloodiest battles of the campaign .
Hills 350 and 409 fell to the 18th Inf .
The end came quickly .
On , the day the division was relieved , tattered remnants of Rommel 's desert fighters filed down from Cap Bon Peninsula .
The Afrika Korps was no more .
Of this final stage , Ernie Pyle wrote : " It was a war of such intensity as Americans on this side of the ocean had not known before .
It was a battle without letup .
It was a war of drenching artillery and hidden mines and walls of machine gun fire and even of the barbaric bayonet .
It was an exhausting , cruel , last - ditch kind of war , and those who went through it would seriously doubt that war could be any worse ... "
Yet , because of those who slugged it out on the dust - whipped plains of northern Africa , the division had passed through its novitiate and become a skilled , mature , battle - wise organization .
There were some who said that the landings at Gela , Sicily , were easy , but for men who storm ashore in dawn , landings never are easy .
Assault boats were lowered into the water just after midnight July 10 , hit the beach at 0245 .
Initial resistance was overcome ; the town of Gela was taken much as was Arzew on the previous landing .
Operations proceeded smoothly until 1030 on July 11 .
Gela overlooks a coastal plain sloping toward the sea .
Far to the north could be seen approaching the first formation of the Hermann Goering Panzer Regt .— 50 heavy and medium tanks .
They continued until they had pushed within 1000 yards of the beach itself .
Doughboys held their ground , even with tanks to the rear of their positions .
Supporting fire became stronger .
By 1400 the assault was smashed , the Germans withdrew .
Then began a campaign remembered not only for the rapid succession of short , fierce battles which marked the division 's progress north and east , but for the hills and cliffs up which men , like herculean ants , inched their way , sometimes only by the aid of ropes and cleats .
Passes were few , trails so narrow and tortuous that often only mules could negotiate them .
Despite these obstacles and bitter enemy resistance , the advance never stopped .
Successively , Niscemi , Ponte Olivo Airport , Mazzarino , Barrafranca , Villa Rosa , Enna , Alimena , Boumpietro , Petralia , Gangi , Sperlinga , Nicosia , Mistreeta , Cerami and Gagliano fell .
Mazzarino was taken July 14 .
Two days later , capture of the heights around Barrafranca severed the main east - west road and railway lines of Sicily .
From here to Gagliano , resistance became lighter as the enemy attempted to extricate himself from the threatening trap in the west .
Troina was the hardest battle of the campaign .
The Germans had dug in on excellent defensive terrain .
They commanded the city from the north , west and south .
The town itself was an excellent OP and artery for communication and supply .
Using Troina as a shield to cover withdrawal of forces from the south and central sectors , the Germans staged one of their last ditch defenses .
Division units attacked along ridge lines from east and west , storming sheer rocky hills and mountainsides against savage fire from all types of weapons , and took the town after six days of fighting .
On Aug. 6 , the 18th Inf. turned the flank of the enemy on Mount Pellegrino , overlooking Troina after a frontal assault by the 16th Inf .
The 26th cut the Troina - Randazzo road and the enemy fled north .
During the battle , the 7th FA Bn. alone fired 9565 rounds and the division withstood 21 counter - attacks .
This was the 1st 's final action in Sicily , although it later advanced to Randazzo against light enemy resistance .
The campaign ended Aug. 16 .
In 37 days of continuous fighting , the division had taken 18 towns .
Palma di Montechiaro served as the rest and training area while the division awaited further orders .
T HE division sailed from Augusta for the British Isles , Oct. 23 .
Maj. Gen. Clarence R. Huebner , who had assumed command on Aug. 7 , 1943 , immediately inaugurated an intensive training program .
HE division sailed from Augusta for the British Isles , Oct. 23 .
Maj. Gen. Clarence R. Huebner , who had assumed command on Aug. 7 , 1943 , immediately inaugurated an intensive training program .
Rifle marksmanship , street fighting , river crossings , artillery practice , anti-aircraft and night fighting ; long marches , close order drill , schools in chemical warfare , radio communication , identification of aircraft and armored vehicles , and waterproofing ; CP exercises , amphibious warfare , hardening exercises — all were stressed .
There was little time for play , less for passes to London .
Intelligence believed the West Wall of France would be hard to crack .
Nothing was left to chance .
Particular emphasis was placed on pillbox assault , and a new method for reduction of concrete emplacements was devised and practiced .
Two landing exercises , complete in every detail , were staged .
More and more attention was given to the big guns .
German prisoners in previous campaigns had expressed fear of American " automatic " artillery and testified to the effectiveness of the 105s and 155s .
The four FA battalions , under the command of Brig .
Gen. Clift Andrus , had more than once proved their superiority to German weapons and their ability to smash a counter - attack , or soften and crumble stubborn strongpoints for assaulting doughs .
Like the regiments they supported , they knew the score .
Triple Play in Normandy RED ONE RETURNS TO SOISSONS T HE battle of Normandy was strategically divided into three parts — first , the assault ; then the securing of the beachhead and the build - up of supporting forces ; finally , the most spectacular operation of all — the breakthrough .
Again the 1st led the parade .
HE battle of Normandy was strategically divided into three parts — first , the assault ; then the securing of the beachhead and the build - up of supporting forces ; finally , the most spectacular operation of all — the breakthrough .
Again the 1st led the parade .
Plans called for a breakthrough west of St. Lo to capture Marigny and then a swing west to Coutances .
The object was to bottle up approximately 30,000 troops in the pocket formed , open the route south down the Cotentin Peninsula to Brittany .
For a month and a half , personnel and supplies had been funneling into the beachhead , and by July 25 it was ready to burst .
its objective within three days .
The front line crust of defense was broken and Germans already showed signs of a disorganization which was to increase steadily in the next month as the Allied juggernaut crashed through France and Belgium .
An aerial bombardment of the immediate front preceded the jumpoff .
At 1000 , July 25 , planes began to come over — heavy bombers , mediums , fighter - bombers and fighters .
Three thousand planes , including escorts , dropped 6000 tons of bombs on a saturation area two miles wide .
Artillery took over and maintained a heavy barrage in front of assaulting troops .
The 4th and 9th Divs. forced a gap , and the 1st , with the 18th Inf. spearheading , passed through the 9th , captured Marigny and rolled west to Coutances , reachingits objective within three days .
The front line crust of defense was broken and Germans already showed signs of a disorganization which was to increase steadily in the next month as the Allied juggernaut crashed through France and Belgium .
The story of the following month 's fighting is one of blitzkrieg warfare at its most effective continual movement , constant pressure , rapid surprise by armored and motorized combat teams and by - passing of strong points , later cleaned out by follow - up troops .
For the footsloggers it was a weary succession of foxholes all the way across France ; removing mines and road - blocks , building and repairing roads and bridges , mopping up nasty little pockets of machine gun and mortar fire , destroying or capturing vehicles , ammunition and stores ; and always sniper fire , ambushes , prisoners and forced marches with little sleep or rest .
A recitation of localities exploited is a travelogue from Brittany east across France to Belgium : Gavray , Brecy .
Juvigny Le Tertre , Mortain , Mayenne , Lessay , La Ferte Mace , Etampes , Corbeil , Melun , Meaux and Soissons .
The Germans stumbled backward , commandeering every possible means of transportation , both civilian and military , laying mines and booby traps , blowing up bridges .
T HESE delaying devices failed to stop the division for long .
One reason was the efficient work of the 1st Engr .
Bn. Like other members of the team , the engineers were not rookies in combat .
They are , in fact , the oldest engineer outfit in the Army .
The battalion saw its first service in Mexico during the Vera Cruz expedition , later participated in the Civil and Spanish - American Wars .
As the First Regiment of Engineers , it joined the 1st Div. at Monaucourt , France , Sept. 2 , 1917 .
Final reorganization was in October , 1939 , when the 1st Bn. of the regiment became the 1st Engineer Battalion ( Combat ) .
Another reason for the speed of the cross-country hike was the 1st Recon .
Trp. , which scouted sometimes as much as 50 miles ahead of the doughfeet , knifing deep into enemy country .

For the first ten days after the Marigny breakthrough , the front line still was fluid and the division moved rapidly , pushing forward in quick advances to occupy as much ground as possible .
From Coutances the direction was south to Mortain , southeast to Mayenne , thence northeast and east to the Seine .
Mid-August the division was applying pressure from the south on the famed " Falaise Gap . "
On Aug. 24 , all units moved 110 miles to the vicinity of Chartres , and in the next six days advanced to the Seine .
The historic crossing of this river was made on the 27th at Corbeil and Melun .
Two days later , the division crossed the Marne and on the 31st Soissons fell — Soissons , where the division had lost 9000 men in four days a quarter of a century before .
For Gen .
Huebner , it was the second campaign through the area .
In the last war , he commanded a battalion in the 1st Div. ; this time he commanded the division itself .
Average daily moves were 20 miles .
The last week of August alone carried the division 300 miles across northern France .
Only scattered resistance was made by the enemy , proof of the destruction and defeat suffered by the great German Army of the West .
Mute evidence was seen along the route in the columns of smashed vehicles and equipment .
The liberation continued in September from Soissons across Alone River , and included Laon in France , and Maubeuge , Charleroi , Namur , Liege and Herve in Belgium .
On Sept. 1 an estimated 120,000 enemy troops still remained south of the Belgian border .
The Germans , however , made only slight attempts to hold coordinated positions ; their main objective apparently was to reach the Reich border before American units .
Many of the foe were left behind in the rapid withdrawal , and the 1st was kept busy mopping up as well as sorting out a vast amount of enemy materiel , including gasoline , tires and food .
Several units lived on German rations for more than a week .
During the first days of September , 390 prisoners of war , representing 24 different units , passed through the PW cage , an indication of the enemy 's confusion .
These men were picked up in small actions as the division progressed northward in the direction of Mons .
The steamroller advance was so long and so rapid that Special Troops at times had great difficulty maintaining service for the front lines .
Nevertheless , they succeeded .
The 1st Medical Bn. , despite tremendous problems incident to moving its installations every few days , kept all casualties moving through its clearing stations at high speed .
Through Belgium to Germany SIEGFRIED BARRIER IS BREACHED B Y Sept. 3 , an advance unit had crossed the Belgian border and reported contact with a large body of enemy streaming eastward in direction of Charleroi .
It was the opening gambit of one of the most costly single defeats suffered by the enemy in the Franco - Belgian campaign .
Y Sept. 3 , an advance unit had crossed the Belgian border and reported contact with a large body of enemy streaming eastward in direction of Charleroi .
It was the opening gambit of one of the most costly single defeats suffered by the enemy in the Franco - Belgian campaign .
This was the situation : the 3rd Armd .
Div. , operating on the 1st 's right on Sept. 2 , had pushed a long finger north into Belgium east of Mons , cutting across the intended escape route of five German divisions .
Three had been drawing back into the 1st Div. sector , the other two were retreating on the left .
These units had been directed to make an orderly withdrawal and occupy the Siegfried Line before the Americans arrived .
T HEY were well on their way when they collided with the flank of the 3rd Armd .
Div. southeast of Mons .
As they attempted to punch through , their southern flank was suddenly attacked by the 1st Div. combat teams in the vicinity of Bavai , Riez de Lerelle and Maubeuge .
Late Sept. 3 , enemy casualties were estimated at 7000 — 5000 captured and 2000 killed and wounded .
What resistance was set up centered around Bavai and Maubeuge ; otherwise , enemy action was chaotic .
Almost equally disastrous was the loss of materiel , including a Mark V tank , which , during the height of the confusion , obligingly followed a column of division transport into a motor pool at the signal of an American MP .
Large groups of enemy were left wandering around the division area .
Eighty anti-aircraft personnel led by a major mistakenly attempted to march through the division CP in an effort to get out .
At Bavai , one company of the 1st Bn. , 18th Inf. , in five hours of fighting , killed or wounded 200 Germans , captured 460 prisoners and much equipment .
During a night assault by a whooping , fanatical enemy , the 26th Inf. netted 700 PWs .

Throughout the ensuing three days , there were no front lines .
Enemy units continued to fight their way out of the division area .
Some finally arranged meticulous surrenders .
The 2nd Bn. of the 16th Inf. took more than 2000 prisoners in one negotiated surrender and felt itself repaid in some measure for D - Day .
Other hostile groups made stray counter - attacks in an attempt to break out .
On Sept. 7 , the total number of PWs taken during the Mons operation was 17,149 , of which more than 300 were officers .
These last included General Wahle , 712th Inf. Div. , his staff and Col. Hesse , former commandant of the Seine District and a close friend of Field Marshal Rommel .
T HE division closed upon objectives in the vicinity of Namur Sept. 8 and found the path to Liege open .
Although opposition was light , the Germans were beginning to organize a defense .
Their problem , however , was to gain time to set up an effective line .
Mines were reported for the first time near Verviers .
As the division crossed the Meuse at Liege and moved on towards Herve , the enemy maintained a heavy reconnaissance screen .
Hostile artillery appeared for the first time since the entry into Belgium .
After the fall of Liege , and as the division pushed on toward Aachen and the Siegfried Line , more rehabilitated enemy units reappeared .
The advance began to bog down .
Resistance was ineffectual .
Co. C , 16th Inf. , pushed to the Siegfried Line Sept. 12 and at 1515 crossed the last frontier .
Deployment of division forces on this day was international — a battalion in Germany , an outpost in Holland , the main body of the division in Belgium , a rear echelon in France .
A reinforced battalion continued the drive forward , and the same day pierced the first belt of defenses six kilometers west of Aachen .
HE division closed upon objectives in the vicinity of Namur Sept. 8 and found the path to Liege open .
Although opposition was light , the Germans were beginning to organize a defense .
Their problem , however , was to gain time to set up an effective line .
Mines were reported for the first time near Verviers .
As the division crossed the Meuse at Liege and moved on towards Herve , the enemy maintained a heavy reconnaissance screen .
Hostile artillery appeared for the first time since the entry into Belgium .
After the fall of Liege , and as the division pushed on toward Aachen and the Siegfried Line , more rehabilitated enemy units reappeared .

Some PWs were found digging hasty field fortifications alongside perfectly emplaced and serviceable pillboxes .
Progress was slow .
The division cleared the dragon 's teeth , part of the defenses of the second belt east of Aachen , Sept. 14 .
Next day the Siegfried Line was entirely breached .
The break came at a fortuitous time .
Enemy defenses were being built up , artillery was more active , new units were appearing , repeated counter - attacks were launched .
A new German division , the 12th Inf. , appeared Sept. 17 and immediately attempted a powerful counter - attack .
The objective was high ground east of Eilendorf .
The attack was beaten off with heavy enemy losses .
Next day another unsuccessful counter - attack was tried south of Verlautenheide .
Meanwhile , the 1st's own punch into Stolberg was being heavily opposed .
The defense was well - coordinated and stubborn , the terrain well - suited to delaying tactics .
Every house in Stolberg was contested .
Enemy artillery was more and more in evidence .
Division patrols were blocked as soon as they crossed the lines .
Yet in one attack by the 18th Inf. in the Eilendorf sector , Sept. 19 , a single company neutralized 19 pillboxes while seizing its objective , Crucifix Hill .
In spite of the enemy 's tenacious defense , reports of PWs and deserters indicated morale was not sound .
Defeatism was spreading among smaller , makeshift units , little groups were prepared to surrender at the proper opportunity .
Even so , the Germans continued to launch local counter - attacks .
Aachen Was More Than a Battle WITH THE 1st IT 'S ALWAYS " DUTY FIRST " W HEN the battered city of Aachen surrendered under the grinding pressure of a direct assault by the 1st , Oct. 21 , Germany lost more than a cultural and historical landmark , an armament and coal - producing center , a key point in Siegfried Line defenses .
Aachen also was a symbol of heroic resistance for the Germans , as Stalingrad had been for the Russians .
Its successful defense was to have been a guarantee of the Reichs invulnerability .
The German people had been positively assured that it could not be taken .
Its defenders had been ordered by the commander of the Seventh Army to hold to the last man : " Your fight for the ancient imperial city is being followed with admiration and breathless expectancy .
You are fighting for the honor of the National Socialistic German Army . "
But unlike Stalingrad , Aachen crumbled and Nazi honor received a shattering blow .

You are fighting for the honor of the National Socialistic German Army . "
But unlike Stalingrad , Aachen crumbled and Nazi honor received a shattering blow .
From the beginning , the Germans , expecting the major attack to develop from the south , had massed their strongest forces there .
Even after Oct. 1 , when the city had been contained on the west , south , and east and division patrols were probing the inner defenses , the Germans maintained strong positions in the south , counter - attacking mostly only to prevent complete encirclement .
But the plan came apart at the seams .
A counter - assault preceded by 3500 rounds of heavy artillery hit the 16th Inf. from the east Oct. 3 . When the bitter close - in fighting was over , half the attacking force were casualties and half the big guns were knocked out .
Five days later the 18th Inf. retaliated with a ferocious assault on Crucifix Hill , commanding ground northeast of the city .
Each pillbox was taken separately after its defenders had been flushed with flame or by direct artillery fire .
At the same time , the 26th Inf. moved into Forst and Beverau Wood .
With these and the Verlautenheide ridge securely held , the last escape road to the north was brought under fire .
Again a savage counterattack was launched from the east .
The ferocity of the fighting can be judged from the fact that after Co. I , 16th Inf. , had beaten off an assault with bayonets , more than 250 dead Germans lay in front of the company positions .
Oct. 10 .
No answer signalled the beginning of the main attack .
Fighter - bombers hammered defense positions and artillery pumped 5000 rounds into the eastern end of the city .
For the next three days the men ground slowly forward , house by house , street by street .
The city surrounded , even more bitter fighting for its rubble - strewn streets was in prospect .
An ultimatum for its surrender was carried into Aachen by the S - 2 , 26th Inf. , Oct. 10 .
No answer signalled the beginning of the main attack .
Fighter - bombers hammered defense positions and artillery pumped 5000 rounds into the eastern end of the city .
For the next three days the men ground slowly forward , house by house , street by street .
Meanwhile , counter - attacks continued .
Another bitter struggle centered against the 18th Inf. around Crucifix Hill .
An even stronger attack was launched , Oct. 15 , by the 3rd Panzer Grenadier Div. against the 16th Inf .
For two days Germans threw tanks and infantry against the dominating ridge of Observatory Hill on the northern edge of the city .
Miserable weather prevented use of air support and limited artillery shoots , but close - in fighting with bayonet and hand grenade finally beat the attackers to their knees .
While the division parried with one fist it socked hard with the other .
From Oct. 16 on , the enemy was reduced to parachuting supplies to its garrison defenders .
By Oct. 20 , remaining resistance centered around Technical High School on the western edge of town .
Next day Col , Gerhard M. Wilck , commanding officer , surrendered unconditionally .
Big guns were silent over a dead city — a devastation of burst sewers , broken gas mains , bloated animals , of shattered glass and dangling power lines , of masses of shapeless rubble .
Not one building remained intact .

Dr. John Hilton , who until just recently was a doctoral student of mine , has written a great dissertation on the impact giving away free ebooks has on sales of printed books .
The findings may surprise you .
Here ’s a repost of the description from his blog :
I ’ve posted on my dissertation before .
The full version is now available here .
Here ’s a little summary of what the dissertation is all about .
What
Deseret Book placed eight books online for free download .
All of these were “ backlist ” titles .
This study tracked what happened as a result of those books being available .
When
The books were placed online September 9 , 2009 .
This study compares sales of these books the ten weeks before they were available for free with the ten weeks after .
Results
During the ten weeks of the study the books were downloaded 102,556 times .
Collectively , the books sold 68 more copies in the ten weeks they were online for free versus the ten previous weeks .
This was an increase in sales of 26 % .
Over the same period of time in 2008 , sales of these same books decreased by 38 % .
Furthermore , a study of comparison titles that were not put online for free found that sales of comparison books decreased both in 2008 and 2009 , as illustrated below .
Featured Books Comparison Books 2009 26 % - 16 % 2008 - 38 % - 6 %
Thus the increase in sales of the eight featured books in 2009 seems attributable to their being available for free .
Other interesting findings include the following : Visits to the online product pages of the free books increased 1,085 % during the study .
Some weeks , hits to http://deseretbook.com/free represented almost 3 % of total traffic to http://deseretbook.com.
( note : the books are still available , but now require registration .
They did not during the experimental period of the dissertation ) .
During the ten weeks of the study more people entered http://deseretbook.com through http://deseretbook.com/free than any other page ( except the home page ) .
All this happened with very little advertising .
Though the impact of this additional web traffic was not quantified , it seems that the value of increasing awareness of http://deseretbook.com could be significant .
There was a moderately strong correlation ( r=.65 ) between downloads and Internet print sales ( the more books that were downloaded , the more books were purchased online ) .
Thus if more books had been available and downloaded the number of additional books sold would likely have increased .
Another interesting point is that the authors of the books made available seemed very pleased with the additional exposure their books received .
One of the eight books studied was out of print .
This book was downloaded 14,914 times and its product page received 834 hits .
This may indicate a lingering interest in out - of - print books , and may validate a “ long tail ” approach to book sales .
Limitations
One limitation of the present study is the relatively small number of books studied , and that the sales of these books were relatively small .
The study could also have been strengthened if it were of a longer duration .
One area that remains to be researched is the perspective of the authors whose books were downloaded .
In informal conversations with the authors whose books were used in this study , they expressed positive feelings about their work being disseminated more widely .
It may be that authors , particularly those with books that are not currently selling well , would desire the increased exposure to the work that free digital downloads might bring .
Although this study provides some interesting results , there are many other questions to be considered .
One question that might arise is , “ What would have happened if the e-books had been for sale for 99 cents each ? ”
If 10 % of the people who downloaded the books for free would have paid 99 cents for the e-books , that would have provided a nice profit for Deseret Book .
While it is possible that some people would have paid 99 cents for the e-books , it seems likely that people would have been less inclined to e-mail friends and blog about a “ 99 - cent ” offer than a “ free ” offer . ”
Future studies are needed to determine how many downloads would occur if they were very inexpensive instead of free .
Another aspect that should be considered is how much the popularity of electronic book devices ( such as the Kindle or iPad ) will change people ’s proclivities to read digital books .
Perhaps most important , if publishers made all or most of their books available for free digital consumption , would that have an overall negative effect on sales ?
In other words , in the present study the seven books saw increased sales , likely due to the special attention they received from being downloaded 102,556 times .
If all books were available for free online would they see this same sales benefit ?
Obviously not .
So , much more to think about and explore !
Hopefully this dissertation will be a part of an ongoing conversation .
They said nobody ever reads dissertations … prove them wrong … go read it !
The dreaded " application configuration is incorrect " error
Periodically , I get asked the following question :
" When I build my program with Visual C++ , it runs fine on my own machine , but whenever other people try running it they get an ' application configuration in incorrect ' error .
How do I fix this ? "
... after which I groan and ask the person if they 're doing anything else for the rest of the day , because this 'll take a while to explain , and probably a lot longer to fix .
This error usually means that your program is set up to use the Visual C++ runtime library ( CRT ) in DLL mode , and the operating system can't find the versions that your program references .
Should be simple -- find the right DLLs and include with the program ?
Well , no , it 's a lot more complicated than that .
Where the CRT references come from
The reference to the C runtime library is added by the compiler , driven by the " Runtime Library " setting :
There are four settings here , arising from two choices : whether you want to use the statically linked ( .lib ) or dynamically linked ( .dll ) version , and whether want debugging features enabled or not .
If you 're statically linking the CRT , then the CRT is being merged directly into your EXE or DLL -- congratulations , you 're done !
You can skip to the end , because you do n't have to worry about anything I 'm describing here .
Therefore , you should ask whether you need the DLL version of the CRT at all .
If you 're making a small , self - contained executable that does n't use managed code , does n't need to exchange heap memory with other DLLs in the same process and is less than a megabyte , you should just statically link the CRT and be done with it .
Otherwise , you 've got to pay attention to the CRT DLL that you 're using .
What happens at compile time is that the compiler embeds a reference in the .OBJ file that tells the linker to include the library file CRT that you 've selected .
This can be msvcrt.lib or msvcrtd.lib for the DLL version , and libcmt.lib or libcmtd.lib for the statically linked version .
The linker pulls the required lib from the standard LIB path and automatically links your executable with the CRT .
This is why you can simply use " cl hello.cpp " or " cl / MT hello.cpp " on the command line , and everything will be automatically set up for you .
Which DLL do I need ?
That raises the question of which DLL you actually need .
Well , it could be one of several :
MSVCRT.DLL , MSVCRTD.DLL : Used by Visual C++ up to version 6.0 , and by the Platform SDK ( now Windows SDK ) compiler .
This one is fun because Windows ships with its MSVCRT .DLL , but the version that 's in it depends on the version of Windows .
Newer versions like Vista and above have additional functionality required by the newer VC8 + compiler included in the Windows SDK .
It used to be common practice to compile programs against MSVCRT to avoid the need to redistribute it and to reduce EXE / DLL size , but I do n't recommend that now that MSVCRT is a fast - moving target .
( Plus , the Windows team never actually signed up for this responsibility .... )

MSVCR70.DLL , MSVCR70D.DLL : Visual Studio .NET 2002 ( VC7 ) .
Hopefully everyone snagged the $ 18 upgrade deal and no one is using this terrible version any longer .
: Visual Studio .NET 2002 ( VC7 ) .
Hopefully everyone snagged the $ 18 upgrade deal and no one is using this terrible version any longer .
MSVCR71.DLL , MSVCR71D.DLL : Visual Studio .NET 2003 ( VC7.1 ) .
: Visual Studio .NET 2003 ( VC7.1 ) .
MSVCR80.DLL , MSVCR80D.DLL : Visual Studio 2005 ( VC8 ) .
: Visual Studio 2005 ( VC8 ) .
MSVCR90.DLL , MSVCR90D.DLL : Visual Studio 2008 ( VC9 ) .
There are additional DLLs associated with some C++ library and mixed mode features that you may need , denoted by ' m ' and ' p ' suffixes .
In current versions of Visual Studio , these DLLs are meant to be installed into the system and are installed via a program called vcredist_x 86.exe or vcredict_x64.exe .
You might be able to get away with not redistributing the DLL , especially since the VS2005 and VS2008 DLLs are typically installed by .NET , but you 're taking a big risk by doing this and you really should n't rely on it .
Microsoft 's advice has always been that you need to redistribute the DLL yourself if you are using it , and this is good advice , because you 're rolling the dice on the user 's machine if you are n't .
You do n't want to spend time fielding reports like " your popup tool stops working when I uninstall Photoshop . "
Microsoft 's CRT installation advice , by the way , is in an article on MSDN called " Redistributing Visual C++ Files " :
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms235299.aspx?ppud=4
Avoiding installation
There are times that you want to avoid any installation on the target system , such as when you 're pushing out daily builds to people on a team or on an automated test farm .
In this case , you can copy the runtime DLLs onto the target system so that they 're only used by a specific executable .
In older versions of Visual C++ , you could just copy the CRT DLLs next to the EXE .
This no longer works starting with VS2005 , where you 'll get an error message about the DLL being incorrectly installed .
This happens because starting with VS2005 the CRT relies on the manifest system to select and bind the CRT version .
The short answer is that you need to copy the appropriate directories from the VC\redist\x86 or VC\redist\amd64 directory instead .
In other words , for a VS2005 - built application , you should have a directory called Microsoft .
VC80.CRT next to the EXE , with DLLs and a . manifest file inside .
For people using VS2008 , there is a nice gotcha involved .
In my experience , due to the way CRT manifest binding works in that version , you must use the RTM version of the CRT DLLs for private deployment even if the application was built with VS2008 Service Pack 1 .
The reason appears to be that by default the built EXE or DLL references the RTM version and redirection is used to bind to the latest version , but this mechanism does n't work when the CRTs are deployed as private assemblies .
Another gotcha you need to watch out for is that the debug CRT is not a redistributable component , so make sure you 're not shipping modules that require it .
If after doing all of this you are still getting misconfigured application errors on launching your program , then you 've got a bigger problem .
What happens when you 're not paying attention
What happens if you have inconsistent Runtime Library settings in modules in your program ?
Well , you get the dreaded but common LNK4098 warning :
LINK : warning LNK4098 : defaultlib ' MSVCRTD ' conflicts with use of other libs ; use / NODEFAULTLIB: library
What this means is that the linker has detected that you have CRT conflicts and has picked one of them to resolve it .
Some people just shrug off the warning since it's not an error , and that 's a bad idea since you do n't know which CRT version you 're going to get .
Others follow the linker 's poor advice and add MSVCRTD to the " Ignore Specific Libraries " list .
While this gets rid of the warning , it creates a far worse problem relating to the manifest that I described earlier .
The manifest is an XML file that is either next to the .EXE ( foo.exe.manifest ) or merged into the EXE / DLL itself as a resource of type RT_MANIFEST , and looks like this :
<?xml version = ' 1.0 ' encoding = ' UTF - 8 ' standalone= 'yes ' ?>
< assembly xmlns='urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v1 ' manifestVersion='1.0 '>
< dependency >
< dependentAssembly >
< assemblyIdentity type='win32 ' name=' Microsoft.VC80.DebugCRT ' version = ' 8.0.50727.762 '
processorArchitecture='x86 ' publicKeyToken= '1fc8b3b9a1e18e3 b ' />
</dependentAssembly >
</dependency >
</assembly >
Prior to the manifest , DLLs were bound solely by the import list in the EXE / DLL , which gives the name of a DLL and a list of entry points to import .
Manifests additionally say which version of the DLL to use .
That there are two separate mechanisms involved in the CRT DLL resolution process should send a chill up your spine .
Either the import list or the manifest can cause your program to fail to load , and the problem is that most people are only familiar with how to debug the import list , which leaves them dumbfounded when it 's actually the manifest that 's the problem .
Remember that LNK4098 example I showed earlier ?
Well , after adding / NODEFAULTLIB : MSVCRTD , the executable 's import list only shows MSVCRT .DLL , and all is good ... except for the manifest :
<?xml version = ' 1.0 ' encoding = ' UTF - 8 ' standalone= 'yes ' ?>
< assembly xmlns='urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v1 ' manifestVersion='1.0 '>
< dependency >
< dependentAssembly >
< assemblyIdentity type='win32 ' name=' Microsoft.VC80.DebugCRT ' version = ' 8.0.50727.762 '

Surprise !
Our guinea pig executable now references both the debug and non-debug versions of the CRT and will fail to load if either is missing .
I 'll resist the urge to make an " XML makes it better " joke ... oops , too late .
It can get much worse than this when you realize that not only can you have debug and non-debug versions of the CRT involved , but also versions from different service packs and even different versions of the compiler -- I 've seen cases where people had a VC8 CRT and three versions of the VC9 CRT in the manifest .
At that point you 're fairly screwed from the deployment side and you need to fix the build itself .
The right way to fix this is to hunt down every path that is bringing in the wrong version of the CRT and make sure that all of them are rebuilt with the same version of the compiler , at the same service pack level , and with the same Runtime Library setting .
The nightmare of tracking this down is when you have static libraries ( . libs ) checked in , either pre-built or from a vendor .
This is when you discover that the prebuilt .lib does n't rebuild properly from source anymore , or it was n't ever upgraded and rebuilt in the last compiler upgrade , or you can't find the source , or it comes from a vendor and you have to negotiate with them to get an updated version .
It 's very important to make sure that everything required to rebuild your prebuilt libs is checked into source code control and that you track the upstream sources for all of your externally supplied libs , or you could get into a situation where you can't resolve a mixed CRT version situation properly .
The other nightmarish part is actually finding the .libs that are causing the problem .
If the problem is a debug / release conflict , you can link with / VERBOSE and check who is bringing in the debug CRT , but if it 's a version conflict , this is the only good way I know of is by brute force scanning the libs :
for /r %x in ( *.lib ) do ( @echo " % x " && strings - a " % x " | grep -r- " Microsoft. VC " )
Track down and fix each offender one by one until there is only one CRT left in the manifest .
There is an alternative option , by the way , which is that you can force the manifest .
The way the build process normally works is that LINK produces a . manifest file , and the manifest tool ( mt.exe ) is then called to merge that into the executable .
You can disconnect this link and reconfigure the Manifest Tool step to reference a manifest of your choosing instead .
I have n't explored this path , though , and it 's risky since you 're still combining components that were intended to be used with a different version of the CRT than it being loaded .
It may be your only option if for some reason you can't fix and rebuild the offending modules .
When it turns ugly
One aspect where this can turn ugly is when you have external components supplied by a vendor .
In that case , you may either have a .lib that you can't rebuild yourself or a .dll that has its own CRT version reference .
In that case , you have to hope that everything references exactly the same version or that you can force them to do so by fudging the manifest .
Static libraries are such a problem in this regard that some vendors have stopped distributing .libs entirely and only distribute code to licensees in either source code form or as a DLL .
You may be in trouble if it turns out that all you have is a .lib built with Visual Studio 2005 and the company that gave it to you is now out of business .
Source code form , of course , will give you the most control and allow all of these problems to be avoided , but may be expensive or infeasible .
The other ugly case has to do with an ATL security patch that went out several months ago .
This patch can cause a CRT version mismatch problem in your build because it also updates the CRT and can change the version referenced by your build even if you are n't actually using ATL .
I have n't seen this problem on my own computers but I have seen ugly cases where CRT load failures started happening in automated builds because the patch was n't deployed consistently between developer machines and autobuild machines .
This is how you get nasty situations where two people with apparently identical development configurations compile the same program and only one of the builds works in the field : only one of them has the ATL update installed .
If you have version problems and see both the SP1 and the ATL update version of the CRT showing up in the manifest , you 've been bitten by this problem and need to either force the CRT version or deploy the patch to all build and dev machines .
What this all comes down to is that you need to track all dependencies that are included in your program and test both the internally deployed and installed forms of your program on a clean , unpatched install of Windows to be sure that it'll work properly in the field .
The future
CRT deployment is apparently changing in Visual Studio 2010 , as the CRT is back to using a plain , non-WinSxS DLL .
I do n't know how this will work out , but it 's possible that much of what I 've described above will no longer be a problem in VS2010 .
Until then , keep your hex editor or resource editor handy , and check the manifest every time your program fails to load on someone 's machine .
The Santa Rosa City Council on Tuesday is expected to join the parade of California cities opposing Proposition 16 , the PG&E - funded ballot measure that would severely limit competition from municipal power companies .
The Healdsburg City Council came out against the ballot measure on March 15 .
Healdsburg operates its own power utility and gets it electricity from the Northern California Power Agency .
The NCPA , which has also opposed the state initiative , supplies power to 16 other cities including the Ukiah .
Proposition 16 is a constitutional amendment that would require local governments to get the approval of two - thirds of local voters before getting into the business of providing electricity or expanding existing service .
Santa Rosa does not own its own utility , but staff is recommending that the City Council oppose the measure because it ’s “ an infringement on local control and authority . ”
So far , PG&E has pumped $ 6.5 million into the campaign .

This story should serve as a cautionary tale for any would - be poachers considering a career in illegal wildlife trade .
While authorities may have their hands full when it comes to stopping [ them ] , there remains a more natural form of justice , lurking among the wildlife so often pillaged -- and in this case justice , like dinner , was served .
A few of humanity 's worst citizens - poachers - snuck in to the Kruger National Park in South Africa in the middle of the night .
They 'd planned on checking traps , but instead found themselves in the deadly gaze of angry hippopotamuses .
Hippos are the animal kingdom's number one killer of humans in Africa , so the men scattered .
Two made it out alive ; the third 's remains were found , ostensibly devoured by lions .

JUST A HALF - DOZEN years ago , Seattle was a middlin ’ pizza town , dominated by an omnipresent delivery giant and a few nostalgic independents .
Fast - forward to the present and suddenly everybody ’s default dial - a- dinner is the subject of rapt attention and furious loyalties .
So we set out to make sense of the pie profusion .
We call it the Great Seattle Pizza Smackdown .
First we ate and ate ( and ate ) , culling the myriad contenders down to a manageable couple dozen .
Then we divided rivals by type , mindful that a crackling Neapolitan slice and a puffy beer - crusted pie are barely even the same food .
And we let regional tics inform the selections .
The city that launched a thousand Greek - style pizza joints has barely a Chicago - style deep - dish slice to be found .
Go figure .
Oh , there will be arguments .
And that ’s as it should be ; pizza ’s a rough - and - tumble kind of food .
But know this :
Just like the old saw goes , pizza really is like sex — even when it ’s bad , it ’s still pretty damn good .

Ballard Showdown
Veraci Pizza vs. Delancey
Ballard is bloated with pizzerias — 17 - plus dot the North Seattle hood , like so many pepperonis atop a pie .
But it ’s Veraci ’s portable oven that changed the game .
The shared enterprise of Marshall Jett , Errin Byrd , and Krista Elledge — one couple , now divorced , and a sister — was just a wood - burning DIY dome six years ago .
Jett and Byrd would hitch the stove to a trailer each Saturday at the Ballard Farmers Market , offering slim slices accessorized with sun-dried tomatoes , artichoke hearts , red onions , and chevre .
They made it for fun , for extra money , and to feed Seattleites a healthier , tastier ’za .
Veraci ’s barely there , brittle crust .

A catering company emerged , and four years later came a permanent pizzeria on Market Street .
From the start , Veraci ’s founders decried the typical overly cheesed pie , anchored by a fat carbo - bomb of a crust and buried in toppings .
Jett rolled Veraci ’s wispy crust by hand so it was barely there , almost brittle , its outer edges hollow .
He administered veggies , meats , and cheeses with a light hand so that his customers could slow down , eat six or seven slices , then leave the table feeling “ wonderful , like they just ate some sushi . ”
Then , last summer , came Delancey .
Darling Delancey .
The steamy - windowed storefront just a mile and change north of Veraci was the precious progeny of Brandon Pettit and Molly Wizenberg , an oh - so - cute couple whose courtship , marriage , and foray into the restaurant biz was well documented on Wizenberg ’s world - famous , food - fixated blog Orangette .
Its opening marked Seattle ’s first artisan pizzeria of the New York style , where pizza makers use coal - burning ovens to churn out individually sized pies .
But there ’s no coal at Delancey , just a wood - burning flame box whose interior temp peaks at 900 degrees .
“ A wood - fired oven makes the pizza look and smell better , and makes bubbles in the crust , ” explains Pettit .
“ I like bubbles . ”
Ballard ’s most darling couple opened Delancey , the city ’s first artisan pizzeria of the New York style , making bubbly crusts in a 900 - degree wood - fired oven .

That bubbly crust begins life as organic , local flour from Shepherd ’s Grain , the pepperoni is supplied by Zoe ’s Meats , and the pork - fennel sausage made in house .
Delancey ’s bright , slightly sweet tomato sauce goes into the oven uncooked on top of a disk of dough that is blasted from below while whirling , radiant heat scorches its edges with tongue - coating char .
This crispy edge is spongy on the inside , and best showcased on the Brooklyn pie , made with aged mozzarella , fresh mozzarella , and Grana Padano .
The result is sweet and salty , earthily aged but fecund with freshness , burnt then doughy .
The hour - plus wait is as much a testament to Orangette ’s fame as to its food : Most Delancey guests silently hope to catch a swing of the lady blogger ’s apricot - hued ponytail .
Surprising , then , that this aware crew often finds itself , well into that first slice of the Brooklyn , deep in the clutches of a forget - you ’re - in - public , sauce - splattering pizzagasm .
BOTTOM LINE :
The only pizzeria in Ballard firing up a truly ecstasy - inducing pizza is Delancey .
But if the wait gets too long , find healthy , cracker - crusted delights down the street at Veraci .

Greek
Olmypia Pizza and Spaghetti House vs. Acropolis Pizza and Pasta
We wo n’t contest the notion it was the Italians who really mastered the whole pizza thing , but peek into the ovens of Seattle ’s pizzaioli , and you find a surprising number of pies subscribing to the Grecian code of crust .
By definition this means a hefty cliff of dough rises thickly around the rim like an easy - grip handle .
Sculpting it takes finesse — too much bread overwhelms the toppings ; the thinner , spongy interior requires a just - so coating of oil .
It ’s all about balance .
Cue Evangelos Pappas , who has owned Olympia Pizza atop Queen Anne since 1991 .
He takes inspiration from time - tested family recipes passed down “ from mother to mother to mother to mother . ”
Pappas started working in a restaurant at age eight , so no wonder that after over 40 years in the biz he churns out pies with innate dexterity .
His are masterful collages of texture , such as the Greek , in which a blanket of feta cheese — crunchy golden on the outside , with a smattering of bubbly brown pocks — conceals velvety dollops draped over onions , tomatoes , spinach , and housemade marinara .
The biscuity dough starts soft and thin in the center and then bulks up with each outward bite .
Olympia ’s pizza recipes were handed down “ from mother to mother to mother . ”

Another notable Greek joint , Acropolis Pizza and Pasta over in Kirkland seems to have the crust figured out , especially with its pleasant pillowlike texture .
Thing is , some pockets teem with so much oil the crust practically disintegrates — delicious — but others yield a tough , dried - out cake .
Thank goodness , then , for the oily mess of meats ( pepperoni , salami , and sausage ) dressing the joint ’s titular triumph — piled so high even a generous layer of cheese fails to fully cover it .
Add in some veggies and you have a smorgasbord - packed punch that has Eastsiders crowding the restaurant at midday .
BOTTOM LINE : Olympia masterfully balances heritage with culinary craft .
New York Style
Topolino's
A New York Pizza Place
vs .
A New York pie is a matter of hand - thrown dough , exquisite mozzarella , thin crust , simple toppings , and portable slices .
And though it ’s become the default style of the many pizzerias in town that do n’t know how else to categorize their pies — a couple of joints are fiercely intentional about their East Coast roots .
Topolino ’s and A New York Pizza Place both appear to labor hard for anonymity — they ’re dives .
With generic signage and plastic tablecloths at ANYPP and hardly room to stand at Topolino ’s ( Sitting ? Fuhgettaboutit ! ) — the appeal of neither is in their quarters .
Reliably fiesty ‘za at Topolino’s .
Image : Lindsay Borden
The appeal is in the pies .
At Topolino ’s , a Bellevue spot cofounded by Brooklyn expat Robert Abergel , crusts are thin but appealingly puffy , topped with rich whole - milk mozzarella , fresh garlic , and a deftly herbal sauce .
We liked the feisty clam pie and a subtler number with pesto and ricotta — we even liked the dingy storefront and brash service , essential New York ingredients .
Across the lake at ANYPP , Doug Armatage runs a less consistent enterprise that nevertheless soars higher .
We sampled a few ho - hum pies on cardboard crusts — only to have our socks knocked clean off by the Hudson River , an improbable triumph of chicken , barbecue sauce , ranch dressing , red onions , and cilantro .
Huh ? say the New Yorkers .
But on this pie the crust was perfect : flavorful and crispy and gloriously blistered .
A big salad presented an original mix of greens with kalamatas and roasted red peppers .
Chocolate chip cookies were gratis .
All was right in the world .
But …next time ?
BOTTOM LINE : Reliably solid like Topolino ’s or periodically stunning like A New York Pizza Place ?
You make the call .

Old World Pie
Wish you could make Filiberto's true Neapolitan pizza ?
Tough .
In the winter of 1982 , while Veraci ’s future pizzaioli were all but padding around in diapers , Mina Perry was convincing contractors in her native Italy to bring bricks and building plans for a traditional wood - fired oven to Filiberto’s , the Italian restaurant by Sea - Tac airport she owned with her husband and their partners .
By spring , Seattle had a Naples - style pizza oven — the first , most local food experts agree , in the area .
A small , slightly rounded woman of 72 who will as soon raise her voice and shake a finger at a slow server as smile angelically after a compliment about her cooking , or her grandchildren , Perry had been feeding the South End handmade meatballs in her father ’s simple , perfect , family - recipe sauce since the early ’ 70s .
( For a brief time , she even fed downtown shoppers .
Nordstrom asked her to do some cooking demonstrations for an Italian festival they held in 1974 , and her lasagna was so successful they asked her to open what would be the department store ’s first cafe .
The partnership was short - lived ; Perry could n’t abide by the return policy : “ It works for shoes , it do n’t work for salami . ” )
Perry had n’t made pizza , however — not like this — since leaving her parents ’ restaurant in Mirabella Eclano two decades earlier .
When the oven was ready , the Filiberto ’s clan sent word to the handful of families who also immigrated to the South End from the Avellino province outside Naples .
It must have been quite a dinner .
She probably prepared a few pies con la cipolla , with a tangle of sweet , caramelized onions , almost no cheese , and her trademark San Marzano tomato sauce .
It ’s easy to imagine friends like Carlo Durante , the owner of Alfa of Tacoma , lifting perfectly charred crust to his mouth , closing his eyes , picturing the village , Grandma , his boyhood home … while a couple dozen kids with names like Raffaela and Salvatore had the run of the squat cinder - block building on Des Moines Memorial Drive with its bocce court out back .
Thirty years later , at the end of last April , Perry stood outside what would be her new restaurant and anxiously oversaw the delivery of a second pizza oven .
This one was also from Italy , but it came built and ready to go , and would burn gas — provided the movers could negotiate the eighth - inch sliver of wiggle room that the door jamb allowed .
The last six months had been difficult .
By this time , it was just her and her son Pat — her partners were gone , and so was her husband ; he died in ’02 .
Displaced by the completion of the third runway , Perry and her son had accepted the Port of Seattle ’s buyout offer on their air - polluted property and began looking for a new location somewhere near the brand - new and , at the time at least , very promising Burien Town Square .
But then all of the sudden the whole country was broke and paranoid , and the new buildings along 152nd Street were empty and alone .
And it was n’t as if Burien did n’t have enough Italian joints .
Notably : Angelo’s and Vince ’s , both red-checked - tablecloth holdovers from the era of Frank Sinatra crooning “ One for My Baby , ” and Abruzzi ’s , a downtown Seattle favorite from the same era that had closed in ’ 94 and resurfaced in nearby Normandy Park .
At her age , Perry might have decided to walk away from it all , but instead she and Pat settled on an annex of the local KeyBank .
The place works , and looks , better than that might sound , although nothing with the build - out went smoothly .
Or according to budget .
Mina
Perry alone knows the ratio of water , yeast , and flour that makes Filiberto ’s crust taste like the essence of Italy .
Image : Lindsay Borden
“ There are people who eat to live and people who live to eat , ” she told me one afternoon after the long - awaited , successful reopening of Filiberto ’s Cucina Italiana .
Perry ’s accent is still wonderfully thick and lyrical after all these years ; almost every word has that southern Mediterranean “ a ” before or after it .
“ There is - a no limit to what they will a - do .
These a-people , they have a passion to a - cook , and - a to eat .
They do n’t a - worry about the cost , ” she said .
Perry ’s customers certainly don’t — tortellini with meat sauce runs $ 17 — and she ’s teaching them not to be in a hurry , either .
On Saturday nights they wait an hour for a table , and then another hour to be served that pizza con la cipolla .
“ I make it all by hand , and I ’m proud of that .
If they do n’t want to wait , I do n’t care , ” she says of those who come for her Old World food and expect New World timing .
There is only one Mina , and she alone knows the ratio of water , yeast , and flour that makes her crust taste like Italy the way perfect pita tastes like the Middle East and buttery croissants are the very essence of Paris .
In a city like ours , it seems impossible — or at least unwise — to declare one pie the best , but consider this :
Before a now - beloved local chain sent out their first wood - fired Naples - style pizza , the proprietors came to Mina and asked her if they could study her technique and practice in her oven on her days off .
“ Huh !
What do you think I told them ?
If you ask that in Italy they gonna break your legs , ” she snapped .
“ The guy , he tell me , ‘ I went to Italy for 10 days and learned to make pizza . ’
I tell him , ‘ Ten days ?
You must be smarter than me .
I been learning my whole life and I still do n’t know nothing . ’ ”
Except , of course , she does .

New World Neapolitan
Tutta Bella vs. Via Tribunali vs. Pizzeria Pulcinella
Tutta Bella ’s certified Neapolitan pizzas ( above and below ) are made with San Marzano tomatoes , fresh mozzarella , and low - gluten flour .
Image : Lindsay Borden
Naples has served up pie in more or less the same manner since the sixteenth century , when , history has it , pizza was born in the western Italian town .
Immigrants to America were forced to improvise , since wood - burning ovens were scarce and there was nary a San Marzano tomato ( said to be the sweetest in the world , thanks to low - acid soil at the foot of Mount Vesuvius ) .
A distinct American - style pizza emerged , but lately some artisan dough rollers have returned to the traditional Napoli style , going so far as to be trained and certified by the Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana , a Naples - based organization , which back in the ’90s pestered the Italian government until Neapolitan pizza received recognition as a distinctly regional culinary craft — on par with Chianti and certain cheeses .
Tutta Bella was the first Seattle pizzeria to be certified .
Founded in 2004 after onetime Starbucks exec Joe Fugere was inspired by his Italian grandmother — “ you do n’t know real pizza , ” she used to tell him — to learn to make the old - country pizzas that sparked her vaguely insulting nostalgia .
In Naples he discovered that product consistency was as fetishized as it was in corporate America : Dough must be kneaded by hand or with a slow mixer and cooked in a bell - shaped wood - fired oven at a temperature of 800 to 1,000 degrees .
It must be crafted from low - gluten flour , milled just outside of Naples , and topped with pomodoro made from the aforementioned San Marzanos .
Oh and hey , paisano , do n’t even think about getting creative with the formaggio , capiche ?
It is one thing to be certified , another to keep up with the rigorous standards .
Maybe it ’s Fugere ’s corporate training , but Tutta Bella ’s four locations consistently churn out transcendent margherita pies :
Fresh mozzarella , spilling sloppily , fuses with those sweet San Marzanos , sea salt , basil , and enough extra virgin olive oil to lend a touch of viscosity .
The crust is chewy at the center and charred to a satisfying black crackle around the edge .
The second certification went to Via Tribunali , also opened in 2004 .
The local chain is best known for its cinematic - cool - meets - Campania interiors , each befitting the neighborhood where it ’s found : glam vinyl booths at the Trib inside the Croc in Belltown , rough - hewn bric - a - brac atop the bar in Wild West Georgetown .
Eating pizza here starts off well .
On the flavor - melding Dante , two handfuls ’ worth of bitter , peppery raw arugula is piled high atop an expanse of tomato sauce , salty prosciutto crudo , smoked provole , and cherry tomato .
But , for some reason ( Prep methods ?
Undercooking ? ) , the crust at Via Trib tends to turn into a wet blanket before the pie can be consumed .
When you eat here , eat fast .
Among the most recently certified , in summer 2009 , is Rainier Beach ’s Pizzeria Pulcinella —its cozy , daffodil - yellow walls are augmented by cheery light streaming from dangling lamps .
Friendly staffers serve up the usual suspects along with original pies like the Chiaia ( tomato , eggplant parmigiana , and mozzarella ) and the sausage - dotted Vesuvio , a tasty reminder that “ meatsa ” need not always be an excessive endeavor .
The crust is more brittle than Tutta Bella ’s and Trib ’s , and hollow at the edges .
It ’s not bad when it has spent enough time in the oven , which alas it does not always have the chance to do .
A pizza cannot be saved by even the freshest discs of mozzarella or the brightest basil leaves when the base is barren of char and tastes mildly of undercooked dough .
BOTTOM LINE : Tutta Bella earns its certification as a true Neapolitan pizzeria with unfailingly consistent , perfectly gooey margheritas , while Via Trib and Pizzeria Pulcinella do n’t quite get it right every time .

Supersize Slices
Talarico's
Northlake Tavern and Pizza House
Northlake pies are piled high with gooey cheese and mounds of toppings .
Image : Lindsay Borden
vs .
Unlike steak , there is no animal from which a pizza is cleaved , nothing — save for the size of the oven — to restrict a pizza ’s proportions .
( But imagine for a second what a wonderful world it would be if cattle made of dough roamed the open range . )
And so the weighty responsibility of balancing boundless circumference with the bounds of good taste falls to the pie slinger .
Take Talarico’s , where the mammoth , individually sold slices are isosceles monuments to the power of perception :
Yeah , it looks like you ’re getting a lot for your money — 14 inches from point to outer edge is an intimidating portion — but you ’re paying $ 6 for it ; the whole thing smells of gimmickry .
Which is n’t to say it ’s lackluster :
The Coppola — Talarico ’s thin yet dense crust covered with spritzes of goat cheese , long ribbons of roasted red peppers , and a dash of garlic — makes an admirable attempt at elevating the classic East Coast slice .
Northlake Tavern , on the other hand , favors depth to surface area .
( Credit the appetite of its U Dub clientele for making that formula a success for more than 50 years . )
Diameterwise , the meat eater ’s special is no bigger than your average pie , but it sags under the weight of mounds — and mounds — of thick - cut pepperoni , Canadian bacon , and chunks of beef sausage that advance to the crust ’s borders like Italy ’s answer to Manifest Destiny .
It ’s edible expansionism , where the terrain is soft with fields of gooey mozzarella and provolone and the rivers run spicy with marinara — you know , the kind of place where a mythical beast of yeast and flour might graze .
And for the lover of all things big , it ’s the Pizza Promised Land .
BOTTOM LINE : Northlake
Tavern weighs in with proof that sometimes you ca n’t have too much of a good thing .
Delivery
Pagliacci vs. Zeeks
Like us , the peeps at Pagliacci and Zeeks categorically reject the notion that delivery pizza , by virtue of its inherently low effort - to - enjoyment ratio , need only be edible to be satisfying .
Because really :
Why , in a city where it takes longer to drive to a pizza joint than it does to bake the pie , should anyone be denied the right to an exceptional dial - and - dine experience ?
We ’ll forgive Pagliacci its Orwellian practice of answering the phone by reciting our name and address back to us because , well , the less we have to talk , the sooner the pizza will get here .
But we ca n’t excuse the crust :
Why dream up tantalizing topping combos like marinated chicken , artichoke hearts , red onion , peppers , and ricotta cheese only to plop them on the hand - tossed equivalent of a Kenny G concert ?
It says something about the quality of those toppings that Pagliacci has reigned over the delivery world for more than 30 years , ever since it began as an Italian family hole - in - the - wall on the Ave .
Zeeks elevates the dial - and - dine experience with flat - out delicious pies .
Image : Lindsay Borden
So that ’s why the following pronouncement might come as a shock .
On all counts , the relative newcomer Zeeks ( it opened in ’ 93 ) is the czar of delivery ’za .
From the airy , buttery crust , to the tangy - yet - sweet marinara , a Zeeks pie is a flat - out delicious disk of awesome .
Even on the überpopular Puget Pounder — piled with Canadian bacon , pepperoni , mushrooms , black olives , and Italian sausage — the toppings are so flavorful , you ’ll taste each one .
Zeeks ’ only misstep :
Its online ordering option .
Makes sense in theory — we go the delivery route expressly to cut down on person - to - person interaction — but they call seconds later to confirm your order .
A responsible , prank order–prevention tactic to be sure , but the extra interaction has no place in our antisocial eating .
BOTTOM LINE : Tasty Zeeks makes it safe to phone in dinner .

Seattle Style
Flying Squirrel Pizza Co. vs. Serious Pie
Get a pizzaiolo talking about his craft and you ’re going to get an earful about correct proofing times and proper firing temps .
Some are so bound to the strictures of their tradition they even get their pies certified ( see New World Neapolitan ) .
Then there are those who favor a more innovative approach .
“ We went in with no preconceptions besides making really good pizza , ” recalls Eric Tanaka , who as executive chef and partner at Tom Douglas Restaurants was one of the visionaries consulted when Douglas decided to open Serious Pie in 2007 .
“ For four months we drove our baker insane , ” Tanaka chuckles .
Tanaka and Douglas asked Dahlia Bakery ’s Gwen LeBlanc to come up with a more breadlike pizza crust than they were seeing around town ; she produced three versions and the chefs nixed them all .
“ We wanted crispier , with a little bit of crumb to it , ” he explains .
So she lightened the dough with a softer flour .
Too cakey .
She tossed in semolina for texture and wound up with too gritty a crunch .
They went back to the original three — and through trial and error ( “ and a lot of Gwen shouting at us to get our act together ! ” ) they discovered that the meaningful variable was fermentation .
Too little , and the dough would lose flavor ; too much , and it would smell too yeasty .
The formula had to change whenever the weather did .
“ Crust is much more art than science , ” Tanaka says .
Serious pie is serious .
Image : Lindsay Borden
They tinkered with their huge 1,000 — degree Wood Stone oven , finally settling on six minutes at 650 degrees , with potatoes going on at the beginning , cheese in the last two minutes ( “ scorched cheese equals greasy pizza , ” says Tanaka ) , and lighter charcuterie closer to the end .
They made investigative pilgrimages to the country ’s best pizzerias , from Oakland ’s Pizzaiolo ( “ where we learned to finish pies with salt , ” ) to the legendary Pizzeria Bianco in Phoenix .
Serious Pie , the stylishly dim and perpetually packed little joint downtown , is Seattle ’s Pizzeria Bianco .
All that bakery back - and - forth shows : Crusts are golden and toothsome , chewy within and crispy without , burnished with delectable bits of char .
On top go A - list ingredients dictated by flavor and seasonality rather than tradition — hence our category name , the Seattle - style pie .
One favorite is shingled with thin - sliced Yukon Golds , fragrant with rosemary and Pecorino Romano ; another is dotted with sweet fennel sausage and cherry bomb peppers .
Much attention is paid to cheese — which Douglas ’s chefs intended to make themselves but learned on about their fourth slammed hour of their first slammed day that would be improbable at best .
Like all toppings here , purslane to chanterelles to delicata squash , cheeses are ferociously seasonal — perhaps an Italian truffle variant , perhaps a tart sheep ’s milk .
The result is simply a masterpiece .
Flying Squirrel makes “ everybody pizza ” with meat from a local charcuterie .
Image : Hank Drew
That fiercely local identity marks South End newcomer Flying Squirrel as a Seattle - style innovator too , crafting its own exuberant combos from mostly organic toppings .
One pie features local asparagus , goat cheese , and pine nuts ; another — the Washington — stars ham from local charcuterie Zoe ’s Meats , with caramelized onions and Granny Smiths .
Owner Bill Coury is as irreverent about the rules as Douglas , claiming that he was n’t setting out to be authentically anything ; he just wanted to make a classic American “ everybody pizza ” with the best - tasting stuff on top .
And — judging from the crowds of hipsters and families that throng the friendly , Mexican coke–and –Olympia Beer sort of Seward Park storefront every night — that he has done .
BOTTOM LINE : Flying Squirrel offers pristine toppings on a bumpy landscape of highly flavorful crust , which nevertheless lacks the moisture and chewy satisfaction of Serious Pie ’s serious triumph .

Hot Mama's
Snoose Junction
At Snoose Junction in Ballard , the zesty gourmet pies and arcade games last well into the night .
Image : Lindsay Borden
vs .
For a city so obsessed with food , we are notoriously bereft of kitchens that serve after 10 pm .
At least someone had the smarts to plant late - night pizzerias in two of the most hopping ’ hoods .
Of these , Hot Mama ’s makes for a nice nightcap , but you do n’t frequent these cramped Pine / Pike quarters for the pie .
Sure , the New York–style , sloppy , big - as - your - plate slices ( word to the wise — fold ’em or floor ’em ) get the job done :
With each bite the gloppy cheese covers your chin with a three - inch cobweb ( yes , it ’s that gooey ) , while the crunch of fresh - from - the - oven crust and slightly sweet pepperoni , toasted just a tad , punctures the early morning fog ( even if the lackluster veggies wo n’t ) .
But the real feast is the people .
Here Seattle ’s Jersey Shore kids spill over from Kurrent and mingle with glammed - out clubbers and buzzed , bearded hipsters .
Throw in tattooed rockabillies and you ’ve got one delicious scene , a true slice of today ’s Cap Hill culture .
Truth is , the morning after , it ’s these characters , not the pizza , we ( sorta ) remember .
Not so with Snoose Junction , which whips up munchies of a higher pedigree .
The crust — fluffy without losing firmness — cradles up to eight different cheeses and a zesty mound of gourmet toppings — and puddles of grease big enough to swim in .
But who cares when it ’s 2 am ?
Once your belly greets a dripping mess of whole - milk mozzarella topped with Yukon Gold potatoes or CasCioppo Bros .
Italian sausage , intoxication takes on new form .
Added bonuses : elbow room , arcade games at the Ballard outpost , and music that keeps the party going .
BOTTOM LINE : Snoose Junction has us wanting more — whether the sun is still shining or just about to rise .
Healthful
Zaw Artisan Bake At Home Pizza vs. Pizza Pi
Pizza
Pi’s vegan and gluten - free pies are so good , they might even win over the carnivore crowd .
Image : Lindsay Borden
We know , we know — the very idea of “ healthy pizza ” just smells like Seattle .
But if the concept sounds preposterous , two Seattle joints defining “ healthful ” in very different ways manage to purify the pie without trading away its essential naughtiness .
Zaw successfully does this in its three ( soon - to - be four ) stark and spotless urban locations , through a commitment to sustainability that extends to the pizza boxes ( strictly verboten ) , the toppings ( locally sourced , organic ) , and even the delivery method ( within a mile — by bike ) .
The idea is artisan toppings on bake - at - home pies , as in the house favorite , the Tailgate — with organic ale - soaked onions , pepperoni , and chewy chunks of Hempler ’s bacon , built on whole wheat , gluten - free , or white organic flour crusts .
So what if the thin crust tends to go cardboardy after baking .
And they ask you to bake multiple pies one at a time , to ensure even heating .
And the first - rate toppings lack the supporting nuance — herbs , where are you ?— to showcase them most flavorfully .
This pizza is free of everything bad except calories and a price tag .
Sort of a big one , come to think of it .
Whaddya want already .
For those singing out “ cruelty - free ! ” there ’s Pizza Pi , a sweetly shabby storefront in the upper reaches of the Ave that supplies vegan and gluten - free pizzas to those who favor them .
We are talking Teese Cheese ( not - bad soy mozzarella ) , Field Roast ( grain meat , and the best pie here ) , and a white garlic sauce that turns in a fair imitation of aioli .
“ This is the best vegan crust I ’ve ever had , ” marveled one trusty vegan , hired as a pinch - nibbler for our team of unapologetic carnivores .
“ And not too much grease ! ”
BOTTOM LINE :
When we asked ourselves which was the greater achievement — pricey pie for foodies or vegan pizza that was edible — there was no question .
It ’s Pizza Pi .
Novelty Crust
All - Purpose Pizza vs. Jet City Pizza
Jet City Pizza traffics in exotic toppings , but it ’s the chewy beer crust that sets the pies apart .
Image : Lindsay Borden
Among pizza perfectionists , a pie ’s crustworthiness is typically judged against the gold standard of Naples or New York .
In these parts , two pizzerias veer proudly off that radar , thanks to secret ingredients all their own .
Leschi’s All - Purpose Pizza takes three days letting each golden crust ferment .
A crispy - on - the - outside , chewy - on - the - inside marvel that not only achieves admirable heft and elasticity , it offers a gentle spank of sourdough in every bite .
A heavily winey red sauce imports yet another layer of intrigue , adding up to a pie that will addict some palates and overwhelm others .
( Kids tend to fall into the second camp , though they do love playing with dough at their own sawed - off tables in the airy , arty Jackson Street space . )
Across town and dotting the hinterlands is Jet City Pizza , a drive - by sort of franchise — takeout and delivery only — that traffics in similarly upmarket toppings .
At Jet City , though , Thai peanut sauce with red onions and grilled chicken , or coconut , mandarin oranges , and Canadian bacon are piled on crusts fluffy with Redhook ale .
You can also order your pie on a hand - thrown buttermilk crust tweaked with Parmesan — but why on earth would you , when the beer crust offers a yeast - puffed featherweight texture with a nearly caramelly malt flavor ?
Thin - crust aficionados wo n’t get it at all , and wo n’t care in the slightest how sublime gyro meat and tzatziki sauce taste on crusts as lush and tasty as bread sticks .
That ’s okay .
More for us .
BOTTOM LINE : Jet City Pizza ’s ethereally chewy beer crust is the underheralded sleeper of the year in this category .
The Canadian Pond Hockey Championships were held in February 2010 at Deerhurst Resort in the beautiful town of Huntsville , Ontario .
I had the privilege of attending this great event and wanted to share the experience .
Why I love Pond Hockey
I have played hockey outdoors since I was a child .
I remember the days where I would skate until I could not feel my toes , and then skate some more .
Whether the temperature was 2 above or 20 below , I would be out on the pond skating .
There is an amazing feeling that you get when you lace up the skates , pick up your stick , drop the puck and just play .
No rules , no refs , no pressure , just hockey … pond hockey that is .
Many of the guys who skated in this years pond hockey championships felt that feeling , skating on the frozen lake , dodging pressure cracks and facing temperatures of 25 degrees below 0 or more !
There is no global recognition or prize money for the winning team , just bragging rights and a cool trophy .
So why did over 200 men and women come out to play hockey , outside , in the blistering cold ?
Because they love the game of hockey , and that is something we can all relate to .
Canadian Pond Hockey Championship Pictures
I took a few pictures from the pond hockey that I wanted to share .
I hope you guys like them
The event was hosted by Deerhurst Resort in Huntsville , Ontario .
The resort is an amazing place to stay in the winter .
They have snowshoeing , dog sledding , horse and buggy rides , tubing , cross country skiing and about 100 other things to do during the winter , oh and pond hockey 😀
On this particular day the temperature was - 19 ( here is proof ) I think the coldest it got during the tournament was - 28 but every team still participated , that ’s what I call true Canadian spirit !
Here is a shot of the lake from the resort , the staff at Deerhurst worked for weeks and weeks to get all of the rinks cleared , 24 in total !
The teams show up in style , every team wore a unique uniform or jersey .
Here is a shot of a few of the guys lacing up for a game of pond hockey
After a great game the teams line up and shake hands , the sportsmanship lives on , indoors and out .
Here we have a team starting a team cheer before the game .
The first night teams were playing into the night , and some even stayed out to get some extra ice time .
I had to work so I did not get a chance to get any night shots , but I did manage to get this cool silhouette
Here is my favourite shot from the tournament , and would also make a pretty cool ad for Source for Sports !
I hope you guys like these shots , and hopefully they will inspire you to call up some friends , shovel off a piece of ice on your nearest lake or pond and play some good old fashioned pond hockey !
Share your favourite pond hockey memory below .
My favourite memory is going out with my best friends , playing until we could barely stand , and then making a massive pasta dinner !

Some conservative commentators are accusing the Obama administration of inviting “ hate groups ” into the White House by holding a meeting with a coalition of secularist and atheist groups .
Officials from the Justice and Health and Human Services departments met Friday with representatives of the Secular Coalition for America , an umbrella group that includes American Atheists and the Council for Secular Humanism .
The coalition called it “ the first time in history a presidential administration has met for a policy briefing with the American nontheist community . ”

President Barack Obama was not scheduled to make an appearance at the meeting , nor were any policy changes to be announced , McClatchy news service reported .
But that did n’t stop a number of religious conservative groups from attacking the meeting as a sign the president has an anti-religious agenda .
“ It is one thing for Administration to meet with groups of varying viewpoints , but it is quite another for a senior official to sit down with activists representing some of the most hate - filled , anti-religious groups in the nation , ” said Council Nedd , chairman of the religious advocacy group In God We Trust .
Bill Donohue , president of the Catholic League , said the meeting provided a “ definitive answer ” about the administration ’s stance towards religion .
“ People of faith , especially Christians , have good reason to wonder exactly where their interests lie with the Obama administration , ” Donohue said in a statement .
“ Now we have the definitive answer .
In an unprecedented move , leaders of a presidential administration are hosting some of the biggest anti-religious zealots in the nation . ”

But Dr. Ed Buckner , head of American Atheists , praised the Obama administration for including non-believers in the political dialogue , something he said was missing from previous administrations .
“ Over 13 percent of the population is considered ‘ non- religious , ’ and this includes millions of atheists , freethinkers , humanists , rationalists , and other citizens , ” Buckner said .
“ We are committed to the separation of church and state and to equality for non-believers in the political arena .
Religious speakers must not continue to be given special privileges . ”
According to ABC
News , three issues were on the agenda at the meeting :
The use of “ faith healing ” on children , which the coalition describes as a form of “ child abuse ” ; the “ pervasive ” religious atmosphere in the US military ; and faith - based initiatives .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ I have witnessed firsthand how [ military ] service members who are openly non-theist have been harassed by their commanders , leaders , and peers , and have been disrespected by their subordinates for failing to hold certain religious beliefs , ” said American Atheists vice president Kathleen Johnson .
Johnson called on the Obama administration to make non-theists “ a protected class throughout the Armed Services on par with the protections afforded to women , minorities , and those belonging to minority faith groups . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Coalition representative Paul Fidalgo told McClatchy News Service that the coalition felt the meeting went “ very , very well ” and that members were “ encouraged by the reception we got today . ”
But he gave no further details , noting the coalition and the administration had agreed not to speak publicly about the specifics of the meeting .
In comments posted Friday , blogger “ Kyle ” at Right Wing Watch suggested that religious groups criticizing the Obama administration for welcoming “ hate groups ” are guilty of hypocrisy .
“ President Bush would never have met with anyone who espoused ‘ hate - filled views ’ … would he ? ” the blogger asked sarcastically , above a list of religious leaders , known for their anti-gay stances , who met with President George W. Bush in the White House during the former president ’s term .

Yele Haiti , the sketchy foundation that Wyclef Jean founded to help the Haitian people — which received millions in the outpouring of generosity following the wake of the earthquake there — paid Jean 's mistress and personal assistant $ 105,000 in 2008 .
That 's Zakiya Khatou - Chevassus on the right in the photo above .
According to Yele Haiti's 2008 tax return , which was posted this week by the Smoking Gun , the charity paid Khatou - Chevassus $ 105,000 as an independent contractor in 2008 for " program development . "
That amounts to roughly one - third of all the money
Yele spent that year on management and general expenses .
So what did she do for that money ?
Khatou - Chevassus is currently listed on Yele 's web site as the organization 's vice president .
But according to five sources familiar with Yele 's operations , in 2008 she served as Jean 's personal assistant — working on his commercial endeavors as well as his charitable ones — and was involved romantically with the former Fugees star .
" She worked for Wyclef on all Wyclef matters , " says one source who has worked with Jean in the past .
" She did whatever Wyclef needed that day , whether it was related to Yele or not .
She would do things like book flights , and she was n't very good at it .
It 's a shame that she made that much money . "
The source said Khatou - Chevassus ' salary amounted to more than three times what Suzie Sylvain , Yele Haiti 's dedicated program director who is credited by many Yele Haiti insiders with actually keeping the organization running , was paid .
" Everyone knows they were in a relationship , " says another source familiar with Yele Haiti .
" A dozen people , including me , saw and knew .
It was n't a secret . "
Jean is married , but he has said in the past that he has an open relationship with his wife .
Jean has a long history of using Yele Haiti 's money for his own commercial gain .
In 2005 , 2006 , and 2007 , the foundation paid out a total of $ 410,000 to commercial entities controlled in whole or in part by Wyclef , including a whopping $ 250,000 for advertising time on a Haitian television station he co-owns .
According to internal financial statements obtained by Gawker in January , Jean did n't contribute a single dollar to Yele Haiti's American operation during the year he founded it , and its founding executive director resigned because he " saw hundreds of thousands of dollars going to business needs and nothing going to the charity , when it seemed that part of Wyclef 's new PR strategy focuses on his charitable endeavors . "
In 2006 , he demanded a $ 100,000 fee to perform at a Yele Haiti fundraiser designed to raise money for his own hometown .
The event was canceled in part because securing Jean 's participation was too expensive .
As the Smoking Gun noted , Khatou - Chevassus seems to have done some modeling in the past .
The photo on the right above was taken at a 2009 reception she organized in New York for Prince Edward 's International Award Association .
( Captions from photographs taken at the event that we found online identify her as the CEO of Carte Blanche International , but we 're almost certain that 's an error .
All of the people we spoke to who know Khatou - Chevassus say it 's preposterous that she'd be a credit card executive ; we 've called Carte Blanche to ask . )
A call to Khatou - Chevassus and an e-mail to Yele Haiti 's publicist were not immediately returned .
UPDATE : A fifth source has confirmed the romantic relationship .

James Cameron is planning to convert Titantic into 3D Avatar director James Cameron has criticised the process some film - makers use to convert a film originally shot in 2D into the 3D format .
Cameron said filming a movie in 3D - as he did with the Oscar - winning movie Avatar - assures better quality over subsequent conversion .
He said directors " should have been pounding on the gates of the studios saying we want to make movies in 3D . "
Cameron also expressed concerns the appetite for 3D films might soon waver .
' Slapdash conversion '
The director said film - makers are now " paying the price " because the studios are calling the shots .
" The problem is these decisions should be made by film - makers , they should n't be made by studios , because if it was up to studios they 're going to sacrifice quality for lower cost , " Cameron said .
The film - maker has revealed he is planning to convert his 1997 blockbuster Titanic into a 3D release , but said it will be different because he plans to take his time instead of doing a " slapdash conversion " .
Avatar was a huge commercial success and was reportedly the most expensive film ever made , with a budget of at least $ 300 m ( £ 185 m ) .
Since the success of Tim Burton 's 3D Alice In Wonderland , which was made into 3D after it was filmed , studios are looking to convert more movies .
Clash of the Titans is now expected to be released as a 3D film .
Speaking last month at the launch of Alice , Burton said it is more about technique , rather than the process .
" With all these tools , you can see good 3D , bad 3D , good conversion and bad conversions , " he said .
Transformers director Michael Bay has also joined the debate , telling movie industry website Deadline.com that he is " not sold right now on the conversion process " .

In yet another deadly rumbling of Earth ’s crust , an earthquake in Turkey killed at least 51 people early Monday morning .
But scientists are warning against drawing conclusions about increasingly frequent earthquakes .
The magnitude - 6.0 earthquake hit at 4:32 a.m. local time in Elazig Province in eastern Turkey , about 340 miles east of the capital , Ankara .
It knocked down stone and mud -brick houses , according to reports .
More than 50 aftershocks measuring up to 5.5 vibrated the region and slowed efforts to treat dozens of injured people .
“ Everything has been knocked down , there is not a stone in place , ” Yadin Apaydin , administrator for the village of Yukari Kanatli , where at least three people died , told the Associated Press .
The government initially put the death toll at 57 but lowered it to 51 .
Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan told the press : “ Teams from the state mass housing project have also been sent to the area to study how to rebuild the area in different methods . "
The Turkish quake comes on the heels of quakes measuring 6.4 in Taiwan , 8.8 in Chile , and 7.0 in Haiti , raising speculation of a link .

Richard Luckett , a seismologist from the British Geological Survey , told the Associated Press there has not been a spike in global seismic activity .
" If there was a big increase in the number of magnitude - 6.0s in the past decade we would know it because we would see it in the statistics , " Dr. Luckett said .
" We have n't seen an increase in 7.0s either . "
According to the US Geological Survey , the earth usually has one magnitude - 8 or higher earthquake per year , some 17 quakes between 7 and 7.9 , and roughly 132 earthquakes a year with a magnitude of between 6 and 6.9 – like the most recent quake in Turkey .
The recent earthquakes are not abnormal in frequency , scientists say , but have received more attention because of the loss of human life .
Earthquakes are frequent in Turkey , which sits atop two major fault lines .
In 2007 , a magnitude - 5.7 quake damaged buildings in Elazig .
In 2003 , a magnitude - 6.4 quake killed 83 children when a school dormitory collapsed in Bingol .
In 1999 , two powerful earthquakes struck northwestern Turkey , killing about 18,000 people .
“ The point is that earthquakes are common and always have been , ” Luckett told the AP .

Over the past few weeks Microsoft has been licensing Linux to a number of its partners , most notably Amazon .
Although the idea of Microsoft , a company steeped in proprietary software , licensing open source software is ludicrous it ’s not completely unexpected .
It ’s also not the first time Microsoft has played the Linux patent game and we can expect to see more deals in the future .
So what ’s going on ?
Back in 2007 Microsoft stirred up the open source community by claiming that Linux infringed on more than 200 of its patents .
Although the specific patents were never actually revealed it was enough to stir emotions and kickstart a campaign in which Microsoft planned to sow fear , uncertainty and doubt among corporate users .
Last year Microsoft sued TomTom , the GPS maker , claiming it infringed on Microsoft ’s patents with its implementation of the Linux kernel in its devices .
TomTom eventually settled with Microsoft and agreed to remove the offending technologies , which included file - management code .
The fact that TomTom settled with Microsoft gave Microsoft ’s claims a modicum of weight .
Then in February Microsoft announced a deal with Amazon which it described as covering a “ broad range ” of products , including Amazon ’s Kindle and Amazon ’s use of Linux - based servers .
Effectively Microsoft is licensing Linux to Amazon on the understanding that it wo n’t sue the company for infringing on its alleged Linux - related patents .
This is not unlike the agreement struck between Novell and Microsoft in 2006 in which Microsoft agreed to indemnify Suse Linux users against potential patent suits .
That deal too attracted significant ire from the open source community .
The most recent Linux patent deal from Microsoft is a deal with Japanese hardware maker I - O Data .
Although the specifics of the agreement are not known the two companies said that the the deal “ will provide I - O Data ’s customers with patent coverage for their use of I - O Data ’s products running Linux and other related open source software . ”
Again , Microsoft is providing an assurance that it wo n’t file a patent suit against I - O Data for its use of Linux .
This is not the first time that a company has tried to claim Linux patent ownership and used that against other businesses .
SCO is the most obvious example and they even went so far as claim that they owned Unix .
SCO , fortunately , was never that successful at winning its claim over Linux and Unix .
Microsoft on the other hand is a potentially different case .
For one , Microsoft has a lot more weight than SCO ever had , not only in patent strength but also in influence over vendors reliant on its platform for their business .
Microsoft appears to be starting to work through companies that want to work with them and demand that they comply with their own intellectual property claims , especially the ones that relate to open source .
Microsoft is also being selective in who it is going after .
Red Hat , for example , is already working with Microsoft on virtualisation but they are doing this without any patent deals .
And Microsoft is unlikely to demand Red Hat signs a deal with them , mostly because they are not looking to have their ownership of open source patents contested but rather to sow fear and doubt in the minds of business when it comes to Linux .
Suing a Linux vendor directly over patent claims would be a shortcut to ending up in court .
And being hauled into court would force Microsoft to open its books and explain what it is that it claims to own .
For now Microsoft is prepared to rely on compliant partners to create uncertainty around Linux ownership .
It ’s a clever strategy by Microsoft and one hard to counteract .
Microsoft licensing Linux << what is going on ?
Before I ask for a drumroll and reveal “ the secrets ” of fighting poverty , a bit of background :
For a quarter - century after World War II , the United States made great progress against poverty .
Then in the 1970s , we fumbled .
Over the last 35 years , our economy has almost tripled in size , but , according to the United States Census Bureau , the number of Americans living below the poverty line has been stuck at roughly 1 in 8 .
One reason is that wages for blue - collar and other ordinary workers peaked in the early 1970s , after adjusting for inflation , according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics .
A second is the breakdown in the family and the explosion in single - parent households .
A third is the quintupling of incarceration rates beginning in 1970 , making it harder for impoverished young men to play a role in families or get decent jobs .
When those factors converge  a young woman with a 10th - grade education trying to raise a couple of kids as a single parent  poverty proves almost inescapable .
Often the cycle is transmitted from generation to generation .
Still , there ’s a reason for hope :
We ’re getting a much better handle on what policies can overcome poverty .
We ’re now seeing more experiments , modeled after randomized drug trials , that measure carefully whether an approach works and how cost - effective it is .
Partly this reflects the rise of economists ( at the expense of political scientists and do - gooders ) and the rigor they pack in their briefcases .
In this issue ...
David Spiegelhalter explains that waiting for an infinite number of monkeys to produce the complete works of Shakespeare is not just a probabilistic certainty , it also gives us an insight into how long we can expect to wait for a rare event to happen .
Genes normally evolve by tiny mutations , but every now and then something more radical occurs and entire genes along a chromosome get flipped .
Understanding gene flipping boils down to solving a problem from pure maths .

What 's the integral of xk ?
If you 're up to speed with your calculus , you can probably rattle the answer off by heart .
But can you prove it ?
Chris Sangwin introduces an ingenious method for deriving the integral from first principles .
Coming to think of it , is the standard formula for the integral of xk really the best one ?
Chris Sangwin makes an interesting case that it is not .

Genomics is one of the fastest moving areas of science and Gavin Harper , a mathematician and statistician , has put himself right at its centre .
He works for Oxford Nanopore Technologies , a company which is developing new technology for analysing molecules and sequencing DNA .
With 75 employees from 18 different countries and all sorts of scientific backgrounds , Gavin 's work environment is nothing like the solitary paper - and - pencil affair traditionally associated with mathematics .
Maths is all about patterns and rhythms , so it 's no surprise that there 's plenty of maths in art .
Whether it's the visual or the performing arts , maths can be a tool , an inspiration , or simply something that 's naturally contained within the structures and patterns .
How do you judge the risks and benefits of a new medical treatments ?
With a finite health care budget , how do you decide which treatments should be made freely available on the NHS ?
Over recent decades the approach to answering these questions has become increasingly rational .
Statistics and maths are used not just to test new treatments , but also to figure out which treatments provide most " health for money " .
To explore these difficult questions , have a look at our recently published package of articles , podcasts and a classroom activity .
THE VIDEO games industry begins a new phase this month in its campaign to reform the classification system .
The closure of public submissions for a review of categories assigned by the national Classification Board has coincided with a state election campaign in South Australia , a poll that could ultimately determine the fate of the review .
Pro-gamer lobby groups , computer games retailers and a newly formed political party are all trying to raise awareness of the issue nationally and to pressure politicians in Adelaide .
They believe adults - only content is sometimes mistakenly approved in the MA category or refused classification and not made available .
Several games refused classification last year , including Left 4 Dead 2 and NecroVisioN , were available from New Zealand websites marketing uncensored , NZ - approved versions to Australian buyers .
October 1 , 2020 , 7:03 am Biscuit breakthrough is spreading
Shocking but true !
The pace of technological breakthrough remains unabated and hot on the heels of the iPhone and that stuff you can spray round your house to get rid of the smell of dogs and mackerel comes spreadable biscuits .
If any of you have been feeling an unfulfilled void gnawing at you every time you go the cupboard to get something to spread on your toast , because none of it tastes like those little continental biscuits you sometimes get given with your coffee when on holiday in France then your anguish is at an end .
A couple of years back when asked to take part in a Channel 4 program about the KitKat when it was at the peak of its derivative product madness , I was asked to speculate what they might do with it next .
On the spur of the moment I said ' some kind of spread that you could put on your toast ' .
I was fairly pleased with that , but I really honestly did n't think that some crazed biscuit doctors would ever make this leap .
If they did I was also mainly expecting it to be in a squirty tube a bit like Primula Cheese spread and not a really quite big jar .
Belgian biscuit baker Lotus well known for their Caramalised Biscuits and Speculoos has found a way turning biscuits into a spread .
This seems to be grinding them up with some vegetable oil , sugar and emulsifier much in the way peanuts might find themselves ending up in peanut butter .
The upshot of this is that it tastes almost exactly like Speculoos , just is peanut butter tastes just like peanuts .
Beyond breakfast I can see this new technology being put use in two important areas .
The first as new form of biscuit adhesive for making advanced types of birthday cakes .
In fact I reckon you could pull off a half decent Jabba the Hut 's sail barge sticking on the window shutters with a jar of this stuff .
The second and perhaps more obvious use is in the manned exploration of Mars .
Biscuit crumbs in zero G during the 3 year round trip could prove quite a problem scuppering the no doubt endless opportunities for a nice float around and a cup of tea presented by 18 months in space .
Lumps of this should be much better behaved in space .
Demand in Belgium for the product has been overwhelming , and if there is any of it spare Lotus UK will try and bring it to our supermarkets .
Biscuit of the Week Club Milk
This summer has been fairly bereft of any summery weather .
Especially when like team NCOTAASD you head off to Ireland before the brief heat wave of July only to return again some three weeks later safely accompanied across the Irish sea by downpours of torrential rain .
So yes three weeks of camping around the emerald isle is now well and truly under our belts .
To put this into perspective when we next bleat on about some charity event that we have become embroiled in and are looking for sponsorship , perhaps you might want to retrospectively sponsor the putting up and down of one large family tent in the rain four times .
In between times we did manage to finally track down that pinnacle of Irish biscuit bar excellence the Club Milk , ancestor of the UK's Club biscuit and recently restored back to its proper configuration and glory .
Read more Last week Review archive Your Feedback Pauline Wilson I recently travelled on Flybe from Norwich to Manchester and was served one of your biscuits with a hot drink .
I wanted to mention to you what a delightful biscuit was served .
It made all the difference to the plane delay .
I was ready for a little tasty delight .
Yours faithfully
Pauline Wilson .
Nicey replies : Pauline , I 'm not sure how you got hold of one of my biscuits as I tend to make them on a Saturday and keep them in a tin , till Sunday when the youngest member of staff plays football .
We have a flask of tea and a few at half time .
Still glad they cheered you up on the Norwich to Manchester flight .
My travels to and from Norwich in the early 1980s were always via National Express coach , where one was lucky to get a cup of Max Pax instant something .
As I recall the main trick with Max Pax beverages was to read the description of the drink ' Tea ' or ' Coffee ' on the cup as taste , smell and appearance were insufficient evidence to go on .
The second import thing was to make sure that all the powered muck in the bottom had been fully mixed with the hottish water , else lumps of it could fall into your mouth as you drank it .
I fear I may have wandered off the point now .

Yesterday being St David 's day we decided to give Sue Northcotts traditional handed down Welsh Cake recipe a go , and here are the results , with supporting daffodil and leek .
Made with currants , and butter again Having been raised in Wales , although being English , I really did appreciate the celebration of the Welsh patron saint 's day , as it was basically a jolly .
In primary school the girls would come dressed in traditional welsh dress , being a long skirt knitted shawl over their shoulders and mad Welsh hat , think Witches hat with the point chopped off .
They would also have a daffodil pinned to them .
The boys too came in traditional welsh dress , which was possibly what ever you normally wear with a leek pinned to you .
Unlike the Prince of Wales 's leek yesterday when he was on the telly , a small delicate affair , most were full size vegetables requiring a couple of safety pins and a bit of string to secure them to the child .
Many boys would start eating their leek raw before morning break giving them an authentic welsh dragon breath by lunch time .
Some of the boys who had the more feminine daffodils attached to them would eat them too in displays of male pride / stupidity .
By far and away the best thing about St David 's day was that it was half day at school .
Even now well in to my forties I find that a March 1st that falls on a weekend seems like lost opportunity .
I feel that somehow I 've missed out on my afternoon off .
It was several years into my working life before I could fully stop my self going home at lunch time on St David 's day .
Somebody somewhere thinks you would like a cake Well its February 14th and the romantic ones amongst us are no doubt planning something wonderful for their special love tonight .
Here at NCOTAASD HQ the YMOS and myself see this as a perfect opportunity to bake some cakes whilst Wifey is out earning a crust .
It may appear that this is merely a way of circumventing my diet , but it passes as romance here - right !
Made with Love .. and butter and quite a lot of sugar too

Smith - Waterman algorithm
The SW algorithm belongs to a class of algorithms known as dynamic programming .
Dynamic programming is used when a large search space can be structured into a succession of stages such that the initial stage contains trivial solutions to subproblems [ 9 ] .
Typically , this involves structuring the problem to an iterative calculation of cells in a scoring matrix .
The following is the commonly used scheme to compute the score of a single cell , score_x , in the score matrix :
score_x = max {score_nw + match_bonus ,
score_nw + mismatch_penalty ,
score_n - opening_gap_penalty - extension_gap_penality ,
score_w - opening_gap_penalty - extension_gap_penality , }
score_nw , score_n and score_w are the scores of the cells to the upper - left ( NW ) , above ( N ) and left ( W ) of cell X , respectively ( Figure 1 ) .
For simplicity , in our case , the match_bonus was 1 if the additional letters to the alignment are equal ; the mismatch penalty was 1 if letters are not equal ; the opening_gap_penalty was 1 ; the extension_gap_penalty was 0.1 for each additional gap .
Thus , the score of each cell in the 2D matrix ( except for the upper left corner ) is calculated by three of its neighbouring cells .
Figure 1 Basic structure of the SW matrix .
Each cell records the score of the SW matrix , which depends on the search and target sequences .
NW , N , and W are cells to the northwest , north , and west of the cell of interest X . Full size image
Software implementation
A pure software implementation of the SW algorithm was developed in the C language to benchmark against FPGA - based implementations .
A single_cell_module ( SCM ) was programmed containing the following I/O parameters : score_nw , score_n , score_w , flag_nw , flag_n , flag_w , flag_gap and result_score .
The input parameters score_nw , score_n and score_w are scores of the NW , N and W neighboring cells , respectively .
The input parameters flag_nw , flag_n , and flag_w indicate the direction of the gap ( 00 2 if no gap ; 01 2 , gap from the target sequence ; 102 , gap from the search sequence ) of the NW , N and W neighboring cells , respectively .
Since the direction of the gap is known from the neighboring cells by the flags , we can determine if the incremental gap penalty of the cell of interest is an opening or extension gap penalty .
Thus , we can perform an affine gap penalty .
The output parameters ( score_gap and result_score ) give the direction of the gap and the final score of the cell of interest , respectively .
The program first loads the target and search sequences into local memory from two text files stored in the flash memory .
Then , their sequence lengths are determined and the scoring and gap matrices are created with dimensions of the above sequence lengths .
Next , the score of each cell in the SW scoring matrix is calculated using the SCM .
Lastly , the completed SW scoring matrix outputs the highest score in the matrix .
Custom instruction ( CI ) for SCM using an FPGA
Since calculating the SCM in the SW scoring matrix is repeated , this routine is a good candidate for FPGA - based hardware acceleration .
The reconfigurable logic elements in FPGA can be optimally configured to run specific functions through the implementation of custom microprocessor instructions , which are assigned logic elements that perform user - defined operations .
Custom instructions , in particular , allow the passing of multiple inputs and outputs in a single clock cycle while the pure software implementation using a conventional microprocessor is limited by the instruction set .
The SCM in the pure software implementation was converted to an equivalent FPGA - based custom instruction ( hereafter , called 1 × SCM ) written in the Verilog hardware description language .
Since the format for the custom instruction provided by our FPGA board ( Altera Stratix ) only permits two 32 - bit inputs ( Input_A and Input B , Figure 2 ) and our 1 ×SCM requires 6 inputs ( 3 scores and 3 flags ) , the inputs are partitioned and rearranged to be all read in a single clock cycle .
Recall that the inputs for the SCM in the pure software implementation are score_nw , score_n , score_w , flag_nw , flag_n , and flag_w .
Using bit masking and shifting bit operations , all input scores and their flags are passed to the 1 ×SCM of cell of interest in one clock cycle ( Figure 2 ) .
The CI produces the cell score and flags quickly because it makes use of custom hardware , rather than using the standard instruction set of the Nios II as in the software version .
The maximum field propagation delay of the 1×SCM was estimated to be 21 ns .
Thus , the clock speed of this computation could be no faster than 47.6 MHz .
Using the 1×SCM , we computed the cell score and gap flag calculations using a single instruction rather than several .
Figure 2 1 ×SCM I/O instruction and arrangement .
A. Bit partition of custom instruction for the 1×SCM .
The input_A and input_B are two 32 - bit data containing the scores and flags from the three neighbouring cells ( north , northwest and west ) .
The output is one 32 - bit data containing the final scores and the direction of alignment gap .
The grey areas indicate the unused data bits .
B. Schematic design of the inputs and outputs from one 1 ×SCM .

Lastly , we added the CI for the scoring of a single cell to the instruction set of the Nios II soft microprocessor on the FPGA , so that it can be called in a C program .
The flow of computation is identical to that of the software implementation , except that instead of calling a function which describes the SCM , we call the CI .
A grid design of SCMs using an FPGA
To further improve the computation speed , we combined 64 instances of 1 ×SCM into an 8 by 8 grid module ( hereafter , called 64 × SCM ) ( Figure 3A ) , the maximum size allowed by our FPGA board .
We programmed the FPGA such that within the grid , the score update of each 1 ×SCM is not synchronized to a clock , but rather triggered by the changes of scores in neighbouring cells in the W , NW and N direction ( Figure 3A ) .
This asynchronous data processing method allows scores to propagate throughout the grid as fast as the field propagation speed allows in the FPGA logic gates , hence drastically improving the computation speed .
This implementation can be thought of having all 64 1 ×SCMs processing at the same time , while the score updating propagates in the grid .
The SW matrix is divided into as many grids as needed , which are then calculated with 64 ×SCM one by one .
Because all logic circuits are connected inside the 64 ×SCM , it takes only one clock cycle to compute the entire 8 by 8 grid .
The maximum field propagation delay of the 64 ×SCM was estimated to be 324 ns .
Thus , the clock speed of this computation could be no faster than 3.1 MHz .
Figure 3 64 ×SCM signal and computation propagation .
A . One 64 ×SCM module aligns an 8 - character partial search sequence to an 8 - character target sequence .
The arrows show the propagation directions of the signals .
Because the 64 ×SCM is unclocked , there is no pre-determined path of propagation .
B . When the search and / or target sequences are greater than 8 , the scoring matrix is partitioned into many 8 by 8 segments , each to be computed by the 64 ×SCM .
Full size image
As input , this module requires segments of the search and target sequences with a length of up to 8 characters ( the length and width of 64 × SCM ) .
Also , it requires the scores and gap flags stored from prior 64 ×SCM calculations in the NW , N and W direction .
A second module was created to calculate the maximum score of the 64 ×SCM by a cascade of max - finders that first finds the maximal score of each column and then finds the maximum of the columns to determine the overall maximum ( Figure 4 ) .
In order to process sequences longer than the dimension of 64 ×SCM ( in this case , 8 ) , a controller module was programmed to reuse the 64 ×SCM .
This module included a SRAM ( static random access memory ) block to store scores and gap flags from previous 64 ×SCM calculations as well as a finite state machine ( FSM ) to control loading and storing values to the SRAM ( Figure 5 ) .
Lastly , to access this hardware from a C program , a final interface module defines a set of registers to hold the sequences , lengths , various flags and the final score .

C. Max score computation of a 64 ×SCM .
The scores of each column of cells in 64 ×SCM are inputted to a custom designed 8 - input max - finder , the outputs of the 8 columns are then compared against each other using another 8 - input max - finder .
The output of the last comparator gives the highest score of the 64 ×SCM .

Figure 5 State diagram of the finite state machine ( FSM ) .
The states of the moore - type FSM are in the rounded rectangles .
The output at each state are defined by the following vector - ( we = write enable for SRAM blocks , rm = reset 64 ×SCM matrix , ena_seq = enable sequences to be loaded , ena_sf = enable scores and flags to be loaded ) .
To clear all scores and flags from the matrix , the FSM is set to the ' Reset ' state .
Next , the FSM remains in the ' Wait for Sequence Load ' state until two sequences of length 8 or less have been loaded by the C program .
Once this loading is completed , the C program will assert the done_load signal .
At this point , the FSM releases the matrix 's reset signal which causes the sequences , scores and flags to propagate through the matrix .
After a set delay determined by the critical path of the circuit , the FSM asserts the done_sw signal , and enables the values just calculated to be written into the RAM .
Theses scores and flags will be read from the RAM for the next block .
The FSM then returns to the ' Wait for Sequence Load ' state , and waits for the next length of sequences to come from the C program .
This loop is repeated until the entire Smith - Waterman matrix has been calculated and the score of the optimal alignment has been determined .
Finally , the results are printed to a command window on the computer .
The FSM can be reset by writing to a status register , allowing the matrix to be used for another set of sequences .

The flow of computation of this hardware controlled from a C program is as follows .
First , the search and target sequences are loaded from flash memory and copied to local memory .
Once this is done , an on - chip timer is started .
Second , score and gap matrices are initiated and the values reset .
Third , the search and target sequences are encoded by a custom instruction and loaded into the 64 ×SCM with their lengths .
DNA bases are encoded into two bits ( A = 00 , T = 01 , G = 10 , C = 11 ) .
Lastly , the result propagates through the grid and completes in a time determined by the field propagation delay .
If the sequences are longer than 8 characters , steps 3 and 4 are repeated for the next grid ( Figure 3B ) .
Once all grids have finished , the timer is stopped and the running time is displayed on the screen .
Testing
We tested and compared the performance of the three implementations ( pure software , 1 ×SCM , and 64 × SCM ) for aligning two DNA sequences with identical lengths ranging from 1 to 1024 base - pairs .
We performed the same input for each implementation and measured the time to complete the computations ( Table 1 ) .
Alignment of the each sequence length was performed three times to produce the statistical variance , which was less than 0.5 % .
The scoring matrices from the three implementations were compared to ensure identical alignment results .
The performance of the implementation was found to be independent to the sequence - similarity between the two DNA sequence queries ( data not shown ) .
Table 1 Computation time comparison
Full size table
The 1×SCM implementation produced a maximal 2 - fold speed improvement over the pure software implementation running on the same FPGA with an Altera Nios II softprocessor , while the 64 ×SCM implementation produced a maximal of 160 - fold improvement over the pure software implementation ( Figure 6 ) .
When the sequence length was smaller or equal to the size of the 64 ×SCM implementation , the computation time did not increase as the length of the sequence increased ( Figure 7A ) .
In comparison to the pure software and 1 ×SCM implementations , the computational time increased proportionally to square of the sequence length .
When the sequence length was larger than the size of the 64 ×SCM implementation , the slopes of the log ( computation time ) vs. log ( sequence length ) graphs of all three implementations approach the same value ( Figure 7A ) and the speed per cell approaches a constant value ( Figure 7B ) .
Thus , in this case , the computation time of all three implementations increased proportionally to square of the sequence length .
This is expected as the field propagation of the 64 ×SCM implementation is restricted to the 8 by 8 grid .
However , if we increase the size of the grid to cover the average size of sequences comparisons ( for example , one thousand base - pairs ) , we could significantly improve the computation time for the majority of sequence alignment queries .

As I mentioned in my previous post about array intersection , all the work we did was to enable us to experiment with skip pointers .
You may remember me saying that list intersection was the most important operation when it comes to search engines .
This is because in web search , most queries are implicitly intersections .
Consider , when your query contains multiple words ( e.g. “ car repairs ” , “ britney spears songs ” etc. ) the search engine will translate this into – ( “ car AND repairs ” , “ britney AND spears AND songs “ ) , which means it will be intersecting 2 or more postings lists in order to return a result .
Because intersection is so crucial , search engines try to speed it up in any way possible .
One such way is to use skip pointers .
What Are Skip Pointers
As you recall from my previous post if the sizes of our two posting lists are x and y , the intersection takes x+y operations .
Skip pointers allow us to potentially complete the intersection in less than x+y operations .
Here is how .
At indexing time , we augment our posting lists of document identifiers with a set of “ short cut ” pointers that reference values further along in the list e.g. :
This way , if the situation allows , we can avoid processing parts of the list by following this pointer whenever this will have no impact on our intersection operation .
Here is an example , let us say we want to merge two posting lists for the words “ car ” and “ repairs ” which have been augmented with skip pointers like so :
We would start using our normal intersection algorithm .
We continue advancing through both lists until we have matched 12 and advanced to the next item in each list .
At this point the “ car ” list is sitting on 48 and the “ repairs ” list is on 13 , but 13 has a skip pointer .
We check the value our skip pointer is pointing at ( i.e. 29 ) and if this value is less than the current value of the “ car ” list ( which it is ) , we follow our skip pointer and jump to this value in the list .
This allows us to skip 3 items in the “ repairs ” list since we know they were n’t going to match anyway .
Using this technique we can complete an intersection operation faster than we would have been able to otherwise .
We can immediately see a problem .
If we augment our data with skip pointers there is now extra overhead for storing these as well as checking for their existence , as well as the overhead involved in actual skip pointer comparisons .
This can negate any advantage we gain for our intersections .
In practice you do n’t want to have too many skips for this very reason , but you also do n’t want to have too few as this defeats the purpose of having skips in the first place .
One simple heuristic which has been shown to work well , is to have sqrt ( n ) evenly spaced skip pointers for a posting list of size n ( this is decent but not the best as it does n’t take into account the distribution of your query terms ) .
What we are going to try and do is test empirically whether or not skip pointers will allow us to improve the speed of an intersection operation .
The Test Data
The first thing to do is to generate some dummy posting lists .
We use the following function :
ruby def create_wrapped_mock_postings_list(min_postings , max_postings , corpus_size ) postings_list = [ ] num_postings = min_postings + rand ( max_postings ) num_postings.times do wrapped_id = OpenStruct.new wrapped_id.value = rand ( corpus_size ) + 1 postings_list << wrapped_id end postings_list.sort{|x , y| x.value <= > y.value}.block_uniq{|item| item.value} end
This generates a list of between _minpostings and _maxpostings document ids each of which is a number between 1 and _corpussize .
We also need to wrap each of our raw numbers in a container since we know we will be augmenting them with skip pointers .
Putting in the skips turned out to be reasonably complex , making sure they were evenly spaced according to our heuristic ( sqrt ( n ) ) as well as making sure everything was correctly handled when we got to the end of the list .
The augment_wrapped_list_with_skips does a reasonable job , using two other helper functions .
There is nothing really revolutionary about these , they were just extremely fiddly to write .
```ruby def calculate_skip_index_for( skip_number , values_to_skip ) skip_index = skip_number * values_to_skip skip_index = skip_index - 1 if skip_index > 0 skip_index end
def build_skip_index_hash_for( list ) skip_indexes = {} number_of_skips = Math.sqrt(list.size).to_i number_to_skip = ( list.size/number_of_skips ).to_i ( 0..number_of_skips - 1 ) .each do |skip_number| skip_index = calculate_skip_index_for(skip_number , number_to_skip ) skip_indexes[skip_index ] = calculate_skip_index_for(skip_number + 1 , number_to_skip ) end skip_indexes end
def augment_wrapped_list_with_skips( list ) skip_indexes = build_skip_index_hash_for list list.each_with_index do |list_item , list_index| if skip_indexes.key ?
list_index list_item.skip_index = skip_indexes[list_index ] list_item.skip_value = list[ skip_indexes[list_index ]].value end end end```
The New Intersection Function
Now that we ’re able to augment our lists with skips , all we need as an intersection function that will take advantage of this :
ruby def rubyish_intersect_for_wrapped_with_skips( list1 , list2 ) list3 = [ ] skips = 0 list1.each_with_skips do |item1 , index1 | next_index1 = nil list2.each_continued do |item2 , index2 | if item1.value == item2.value list3 << item2 index2 + 1 elsif item1.value < item2.value while !item1.skip_index.nil ? && item1.skip_value <= item2.value next_index1 = item1.skip_index item1 = list1 [ next_index1 ] skips += 1 end index2 else next_index2 = nil while !item2.skip_index.nil ? && item2.skip_value <= item1.value next_index2 = item2.skip_index item2 = list2[ next_index2 ] next_index1 = index1 skips += 1 end next_index2 end end next_index1 end list3 end
As you can see it is quite a bit more complex than the previous intersection functions we have written .
This does nothing more than what I described above :
looks for a skip pointer
if found , checks the value it is pointing at
figures out if we ’re able to follow the skip by comparing the current value of the other list with the value the skip is pointing at
follows the skip pointer if possible
It could certainly use a helper function or two , but I believe keeping it all in one place makes the algorithm a bit clearer .
One thing to note is the fact that the outer each iterator is no longer just a standard one , we ’ve had to open up our Array class and add the following :
ruby class Array def each_with_skips current_index = 0 while current_index < self.size next_index = yield ( self [ current_index ] , current_index ) if next_index current_index = next_index else current_index += 1 end end end end
This essentially allows us to return a value from the block , which will be used as the index to continue the iteration from on the next pass , allowing us to “ skip ” a number of values when we ’re able to follow the skip pointers of the outer iterator .
The inner iterator still uses the “ _eachcontinued ” function that we wrote in the last post as it already had the ability to skip values when necessary .
If you can re-write this intersection function to be tighter and more “ ruby- ish ” , do share it , I ’d be intersected to see what other people can come up with .
The Experiment
We ’re now ready to run our experiment to see if skip pointers can actually make a difference .
All we need is a method to time the execution of our intersection functions .
Fortunately I have written about timing Ruby code before ( how lucky is that :) ) , so we ’ll just take the timing method from there :
ruby def time_method ( method=nil , * args ) beginning_time = Time.now if block_given ?
yield else self .
send ( method , args ) end end_time = Time.now puts
" Time elapsed # {( end_time - beginning_time ) * 1000} milliseconds "
end
We want to compare three things :
intersecting two lists of raw integers ( not augmented by skip pointers and not wrapped by another object )
intersecting two lists of “ wrapped ” integers ( wrapped by another object to possibly contain more data ) without using skip pointers
intersecting two lists of “ wrapped ” integers ( wrapped by another object to possibly contain more data , such as the skips ) using skip pointers
Here is the code :
```ruby def create_raw_mock_postings_list( min_postings , max_postings , corpus_size ) postings_list = [ ] num_postings = min_postings + rand ( max_postings ) num_postings.times do postings_list << rand ( corpus_size ) + 1 end postings_list.sort.uniq
end
def wrap_raw_list ( list ) wrapped_list = [ ] list .each do |item| wrapped_item = OpenStruct.new wrapped_item.value = item wrapped_list << wrapped_item end wrapped_list.sort{|x , y| x.value <=> y.value}.block_uniq{|item| item.value} end
CORPUS_SIZE = 100000000
raw_list1 = create_raw_mock_postings_list( 100 , 200 , CORPUS_SIZE ) raw_list2 = create_raw_mock_postings_list(30000 , 50000 , CORPUS_SIZE )
wrapped_list1 = wrap_raw_list( raw_list1 ) wrapped_list2 = wrap_raw_list(raw_list2 )
wrapped_list1_with_skips = augment_wrapped_list_with_skips(wrapped_list1 ) wrapped_list2_with_skips = augment_wrapped_list_with_skips(wrapped_list2 )
puts “ ” puts “ RAW ” puts “ — — — — — — — — — — — — — — ——— —— ” time_method(:rubyish_intersect_for_raw , raw_list1 , raw_list2 ) puts “ ” puts “ WRAPPED ” puts “ — — — — — — — — — — — — — — ——— —— ” time_method(:rubyish_intersect_for_wrapped , wrapped_list1 , wrapped_list2 ) puts “ ” puts “ WRAPPED WITH SKIPS ” puts “ — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —— —— ” wrapped_list1_with_skips.reset_current_index wrapped_list2_with_skips.reset_current_index time_method(:rubyish_intersect_for_wrapped_with_skips , wrapped_list1_with_skips , wrapped_list2_with_skips ) ```
Running this , we get results similar to the following :
RAW ---------------------------------------------------------
Time elapsed 59.634 milliseconds WRAPPED
---------------------------------------------------------
Time elapsed 265.142 milliseconds WRAPPED WITH SKIPS
---------------------------------------------------------
Time elapsed 245.459 milliseconds
I wo n’t bore you by running this dozens of times here , suffice to say I did run this lots and lots of times while tweaking the parameters :) ( i.e. the sizes of the lists , the corpus size ) .
Here is what I found .
No matter what you do , intersecting a “ raw ” ( not wrapped in a decorator and no skip pointers ) list is always significantly faster .
This is to be expected , but ultimately means nothing since it is not possible to augment these raw values with skip pointers anyway .
Regardless in a real search engine index , document ids in posting lists will often need to contain extra data in addition to skip pointers ( e.g. positional information etc. ) and so will almost never be raw numbers .
What we ’re really interested in is comparing “ wrapped ” lists with and without skips .
As you can see from the output above , skip pointers made the list intersection slightly faster , but this is not always the case .
Here are some interesting facts that I have found :
when both lists are sufficiently small , we never skip but the time difference is negligible due to the size of the lists
for larger lists of similar size ( i.e. both lists around 30000 values ) skip pointers are followed rarely and are therefore actually detrimental to the performance of the intersection function ( due to the overhead of checking the skip values but being unable to follow ) , with the times being 10 % to 40 % slower for lists with skips
when posting list sizes are orders of magnitude different ( i.e. list of size 200 vs list of size 20000 like the code above ) , skip pointers begin to come into their own since the larger list is able to skip a lot more often , the improvement is around 10 % to 40 % ( 10 is more likely than 40 )
As you can see , skip pointers certainly can improve the speed of an intersection function , but only in certain situations .
Of course there are a couple of things to be aware of .
Firstly , random generation of posting lists data may not be representative of the distribution of the document ids , in a posting list , in a real search engine index .
When randomly generated , document ids end up evenly distributed across the size of the corpus , in real life , this is likely not to be the case , which may allow us to skip a lot more often , improving performance .
Secondly , we augmented our data with skip pointers in a somewhat naive fashion ( sqrt ( n ) ) .
If we can come up with another heuristic that will fit our data better ( through data analysis ) , we may be able to improve performance even more .
Well , there we go , some interesting code , a new concept and a modified intersection algorithm , do n’t forget to subscribe to my feed if you enjoyed it .
As always , if you have something to add or have a question , I ’d love to hear from you .
For security reasons , Kim rarely shows up at outdoor rallies .
A South Korean security official said this was the first time Kim ever attended an industrial mass rally .
In the past , he sometimes attended only political or military events such as a military parade on the 55th anniversary of North Korea in September 2003 and another on the 75th anniversary of the North Korean Army .
North Korean leader Kim Jong - il attended a mass rally in Hamhung , South Hamgyong Province to celebrate the dedication of the February 8 Vinalon Complex , which resumed operation for the first time in 16 years , the North Korean media reported Saturday .
The only time North Koreans heard his voice was at a ceremony marking the North Korean Army 's anniversary in April 1992 , when he uttered the single sentence , " Glory to the heroic soldiers of the People 's Army ! "
Rumors had it that even such a cry was a result of a " broadcasting accident " -- that his voice was inadvertently broadcast .
Meanwhile , his voice was not heard at the latest mass rally .
[ North ] Korean Central TV and Central Broadcasting relayed a detailed recording of Kim 's attendance at the mass rally in Hamhung which drew about 10,000 people .
Kim has taken an unusual interest in vinalon this year , a synthetic fiber North Korea has developed using carbide extracted from anthracite .
It is called the " juche ( self - reliant ) fiber " in the North .
He visited the Hamhung plant for two days in early February and even invited Wang Jiarui , the director of the Chinese Communist Party 's International Liaison Department , there for a meeting when he was on a state visit to the country .
Ryu Dong-ryeol , a researcher at the Police Science Institute , said , " Vinalon was a symbol of solutions to the clothing problem in the North in the 1960s and 70s .
The North is now touting it to give the people the illusion of a better life . "
LONDON , Dec. 10 , 2008  -- SKY TV will broadcast a British television first tonight -- an American man committing suicide .
Craig Ewert , who had been living for many years in Yorkshire , North England , ended his life in 2006 in an assisted suicide clinic in Switzerland , rather than live with motor neurone disease that had left him paralyzed .
He also invited Canadian filmmakers to capture his final moments , which will be broadcast this evening .
The documentary will show Ewert , 59 , swallowing a lethal mixture of sedatives and switching off his life - support machine with his wife by his side .
The final exchange between husband and wife , who spent 37 years together , is captured on camera .
His wife Mary Ewert says : " Can I give you a kiss ? "
He replies : " Of course . "
They tell one another they love each other one final time and she says : " Have a safe journey .
I will see you some time . "
Ewert , who had lost the use of his limbs , used his mouth to switch off his machine .
He died 45 minutes later , listening to Beethoven 's Symphony No. 9 .
The father of two explained his decision in an interview during the film : " I am tired of the disease but I am not tired of living .
I still enjoy life enough that I would like to continue but the thing is that I really cannot .
If I opt for life , then that is choosing to be tortured rather than end this journey and start the next one .
I can not take the risk .
Let 's face it , when you 're completely paralyzed and cannot talk , how do you let somebody know you are suffering ? "
His wife , does n't think that it was intrusive to allow cameras to film the death of her husband and maintains that it was about spreading a message .
She told the Daily Mail she has no regrets .
" If this film gets people thinking about death and talking about it , that 's all that Craig would have wished .
...
We were both convinced that controversial issues , such as showing someone dying on TV , are only controversial because there 's such a taboo surrounding them . "
Assisted Suicide
Craig Ewert paid nearly $ 4,500 to the controversial Swiss - assisted suicide clinic Dignitas to end his life .
Famous for its " suicide tourists , " Dignitas has helped an estimated 700 - plus people from 25 countries to die since it opened in 1998 .
Assisted suicide has been legal in Switzerland since 1941 but it remains a criminal offence nearly everywhere else .
Only Belgium , the Netherlands and the state of Oregon permit assisted suicide under certain circumstances .
Veteran Scottish politician Margo Macdonald , who is suffering from Parkinson 's disease , hopes the idea will spread .
She is trying to pass a bill in Scottish parliament to make assisted suicide legal in the country .
Macdonald told ABC
News that , although she personally does n't believe this private moment should have been broadcast , she thinks it focused peoples ' minds on the subject .
She said everyone should have the right to choose .
" What you see happening in the film is exactly the reason why I am introducing my bill , " she said .
" The loss of dignity came from Craig having to go to another country to die when he wanted to die at home surrounded by friends and family . "
This is the first time British television has shown someone committing assisted suicide and it has yet again re-ignited a fierce debate on the controversial and emotive subject of euthanasia .
That 's why Terence McKeown of the Canadian company Point Grey Pictures , the film 's producer , thought it was important to make the documentary .
He told the Independent newspaper , " We felt there was a great deal of value in demystifying this suicide process , because whether people approve of it or not , we think they understand it .
If people want to attack it , they should at least know what they are attacking . "
Some people see this kind of show as another reality TV stunt in the cut - throat race to attract ratings .
" Its reducing suicide -- a very serious subject -- into a peep show , " Phyllis Bowman of the lobby group Right to Life , told ABC News.com .
" It 's a real tragedy . "
Television monitoring bodies are now questioning whether this sort of thing should be aired .
Real - Life Broadcast
Barbara Gibbon , head of Sky Real Lives , has defended the channel 's decision to show the film .
Gibbon told ABC News.com that the documentary is topical , honest and impartial .
" The story of Craig and Mary Ewert provides a moving insight into the real - life stories that lie behind the debate over the morality and legality of assisted suicide , " she said .
" As a broadcaster , we believe that there is a role for television to inform public debate about even the most challenging subjects . "
Anti-euthanasia groups argue that this glorifies assisted suicide and could influence people in the wrong way .
But Craig told the filmmakers that he believed capturing his final moments would be " educative " and would " remove the veil " when thinking about death .
President Hugo Chavez has systematically destroyed Petroleos de Venezuela and wrecked the national electricity sector since coming to power 11 years ago .
Now Chavez is in the final stages of dismantling the basic steel and aluminum industries in the Guayana region , and is blaming it all on El Nino and global warming stoked by capitalist imperialism .
Chavez justifies his wholesale destruction of Venezuela ’s most important strategic assets with the claim that he is “ rescuing ” the “ sovereignty of the people ” from the “ imperialist invaders . ”
However , the Bolivarian revolution has only brought ruin to all the strategic industries which are critical to Venezuela ’s present and future .
Pdvsa struggles today to produce about 2.13 million b/d of crude oil compared with about 3.5 million b/d in 1998 .
Crude oil production capacity has shrunk by about 1.5 million b/d in the Chavez era .
But the company ’s payroll has ballooned to over 90,000 at end -2009 from about 20,000 in 2003 after Chavez purged half its work force for political reasons .
Its refineries are falling apart , and the four Orinoco upgraders nationalized in 2007 suffer frequent operating problems .
All of Pdvsa ’s expansion plans announced in 2005 ( Siembra Petrolera ) are years behind schedule ; not a single major project has been commissioned yet .
Since 2003 , the new Pdvsa ’s total debt has soared to over $ 23 billion .
Pdvsa also owes about $ 20 - 25 billion more to the former foreign / private owners of the Orinoco upgraders , oil services companies and other assets Chavez has nationalized since 2007 .
Also , Pdvsa ’s debts to services firms and contractors reportedly total about $ 8 - 10 billion .
But Energy Minister Rafael Ramirez claims that Pdvsa ’s operational / financial health has never been better .
The power sector , nationalized by Chavez in first - quarter 2007 , also has collapsed .
Venezuelans rang in the New Year with mandatory restrictions on power consumption .
Shopping centers , casinos and bingo parlors , and roadside billboards are operating under strict schedules , and any violation of those schedules will be punished .
Commercial and industrial consumption is capped at 2 MW and 5 MW , respectively , per client , but the regime wants these large consumers to install their own power plants .
Residential consumption caps also will be set .
Anyone who exceeds their monthly quotas will be slapped with a surcharge and power could be shut off for 24 - 72 hours per “ infraction . ”
The regime also reportedly will set consumption limits for manufacturing companies in processed foods , beverages , textiles , automotive , pharmaceuticals and metalmechanics producers .
But it does n’t stop there .
The Chavez regime also has cut power supplies to the basic ( aka strategic ) steel and aluminum industries in the Guayana region , ordering steelmaker Sidor , and aluminum smelters Alcasa and Venalum , to reduce power consumption immediately by 200 MW , 59 MW , and 300 MW , respectively , for total cuts of 559 MW that will remain in effect indefinitely .
As a result , Sidor has shut down about 60 % of its liquid steelmaking capacity , plus its flat products mill and most of its rolled products mill .
The company ’s liquid steel output for 2010 is estimated at 2.9 million metric tons , the lowest level since 1997 .
Sidor also reportedly lost over $ 410 million in 2009 and its losses in 2010 could easily double despite the plunge in liquid steel production .
The regime also shut down Alcasa ’s Lines I and II , which used energy - intensive 1960 ’s - era technology , and taking about 30 % of 210,000 mtpy smelting capacity out of service permanently , since there are no plans ( or money ) to build Line V .
And over at Venalum , 360 reduction cells ( 40 % of its smelting capacity ) were shut down until the regime decides the national power crisis is over .
However , the power crisis wo n’t end soon .
Venezuela is suffering a severe drought due to El Nino .
The Guri Dam ’s water level reportedly has dropped over nine meters in the past year .
If the rains do n’t start before end -February , Guri ’s water level could drop to the point where electricity generation also declines .
About 2,500 MW of Guri ’s 10,000 MW hydro-electric capacity already reportedly is offline due to programmed maintenance and equipment malfunctions .
If Guri ’s power generation drops , the regime probably will expand power rationing and consumption restrictions because it has no other options .
Venezuela does n’t have any spare thermal electricity generation capacity because the Chavez regime does n’t maintain the power grid and has n’t finished / commissioned even a quarter of the “ new ” thermal generation projects that originally were announced back in 2001 - 2003 .
President Chavez has announced at least a half - dozen expansion “ plans ” for the sector since 2006 , each new plan repeating the previous plans , but deadlines are always missed .
“ Catching up ” would take at least five years and cost over $ 20 billion , according to former energy ministry and Edelca / Cadafe engineers .
However , the regime does n’t have the management , technical or financial capacity to fix the problem , so it is turning to its new “ strategic ” partners .
The Chavez regime has signed hundreds of economic , security and other agreements since 2005 with countries like Iran , China , Russia , Cuba , Belarus , Algeria , India , Brazil , Argentina , etc .
For example , on 22 December 2009 Corpoelec and its Chinese counterpart signed an agreement to discuss development of joint hydro - power generation and transmission projects in Venezuela .
In 2008 , Russia ’s government said it would help Venezuela develop a nuclear power program for peaceful purposes .
In 2009 , Spanish contractors Duro Felguera , Iberdrola and Elecnor were awarded two turnkey projects to build combined cycle thermal power generation plants of 1,620 MW ( Duro Felguera ) and 1,000 MW ( Iberdrola / Elecnor ) , respectively .
The projects awarded to the Spanish contractors were grossly overpriced ( for someone ’s benefit ) .
At year - end 2009 , an Argentine / Spanish consortium won a $ 760 million turnkey contract to build the 500 MW combined cycle Termozulia III plant in Zulia , of which $ 600 million is already guaranteed by the Andean Development Corporation ( CAF ) .
However , none of the generation plants are scheduled to be commissioned until 2013 - 2014 , assuming the gas and / or fuel oil supplies are available .
Meanwhile , all Venezuelans increasingly will suffer hardships enforced by Chavez and his incompetent / corrupt regime .
However , no one should expect Chavez ’s new Cuban , Iranian , Chinese and Russian partners to end the multiple crises affecting the oil / gas , electricity , steel , aluminum and other state - owned industries .
The governments of these countries are milking the Bolivarian regime for their own economic and / or geopolitical advantage .
These countries have signed dozens of agreements with the regime which are easily worth perhaps $ 200 - 250 billion if all the proposed / planned joint ventures , Bolivarian giveaways to these regimes , arms buys , etc. announced since 2005 are lumped together .
But a closer look reveals that there ’s no beef in the bun …
“ No se le ve el queso a la tostada . ”
Not a single joint venture has actually been incorporated and launched yet with any of these strategic partners .
But maybe things will be different in 2010 .
Airlines and hotels raised prices in the fourth quarter of 2009 , but costumers responded by cutting their spending on travel .
The Commerce Department reported that prices for passenger air transportation jumped 36 % at an annual rate in the fourth quarter after rising 2.4 % a quarter earlier .
Meanwhile , accommodations costs jumped 3.1 % following four quarters of the decline .
Tourism - related industries experienced strong spending gains in the third quarter , which likely encouraged companies to start raising prices after a sharp drop in travel sparked by the recession .
But , the price increases may have depressed demand with overall tourism and travel spending dropping 2.3 % at an annual rate in the fourth quarter .
Employment at tourism - related industries dropped for the seventh consecutive quarter , but the 2.3 % fall represented a slowing rate of decline .
There were 8.1 million workers in the industry in the fourth quarter , 47,000 fewer than the previous quarter .
All sectors in the industry posted declines .
Allawi ’s secular party takes 91 seats against 89 for Maliki .
The UN declares the elections " a success " and " credible . "
Open discussions on alliances for the majority .
The security challenge : twin attack yesterday in Diyala , with 42 deaths .
Withdrawal of U.S. forces by years end .
Baghdad ( AsiaNews / Agencies ) -
The secular Iyad Allawi has won the elections in Iraq only two seats ahead of Nouri al - Maliki , leader of the outgoing government , who refuses to recognize the results .
Maliki can appeal until 29 March when the results will be considered definitive .
The UN special envoy , Ad Melkert , has called the vote " a success " and " credible " , and has asked all parties to " accept the results . "
Allawi's Iraqiya bloc won 91 seats , against 89 for Maliki ’s Alliance for the Rule of Law , but neither can claim a great victory , both having failed to win a large majority of the 325 seats in parliament .
Allawi - a secular Shiite backed by Sunnis and Christians - has already opened negotiations to form alliances with other groups .
" Iraqiya - he said - will its heart to all political forces and all those who want to build Iraq .
We will put to an end together politics based on ethnicity and religion " .
It is likely that in order to have a majority , Allawi will have to ally himself to the party of Moqtada al - Sadr ( Iraqi National Alliance , of the Shiite religious mould ) , which took 70 seats and the Kurdish group , which won 43 seats .
Some observers suggest an alliance government between the Allawi and Maliki , to give stability to the country , but the ambitions of both seem to exclude this possibility .
As a reminder of the fragility of the situation yesterday , just before the announcement of the results , there were two bomb attacks in Diyala , north of the capital , which left 42 people dead and 65 wounded .
The coalition that emerges will have to resolve the issues that are being debated for some time on in Iraq : federalism and centralism , the distribution of oil revenues , the status of Kirkuk .
In addition it will face the problem of security , while U.S. forces are preparing to withdraw by the end of the year .

This year 's cheese - rolling event in Gloucestershire has been cancelled after concerns about safety because of the number of spectators it attracts .
Organisers of the event at Cooper 's Hill near Brockworth said 15,000 people attended last year 's event - more than three times the site 's capacity .
Police and the local authority are working with the cheese rolling committee to improve safety and access .
It is hoped the event will go ahead on the late May Bank Holiday in 2011 .
One of the organisers Richard Jefferies said : " A few years ago we were only having several hundred people .
" Last year , the police estimate was 15,000 and they reckon it will be even more this year because it has got so internationally well - known .
" It 's a matter of trying to find some way of reducing the numbers attending . "

He said apart from the health and safety aspects , organisers needed to respect the concerns of local people , some of whom had property damaged by people climbing over fences .
The event had public liability insurance cover for 5,000 people and the insurance company would have to know exactly how many were coming if the number was exceeded , he added .
Also , the roads were becoming too congested to allow emergency services to get vehicles to the site in the event of an accident .
The competition , which dates back hundreds of years , involves participants chasing a 7lb Double Gloucester cheese down the hill in a series of races .
The winner of each race wins the cheese .
All of the cheeses thrown down the hill are made by Diana Smart , 83 , on her farm at Birdwood in the Forest of Dean .
She said she was " shattered " by the news that this year 's event had been cancelled .
" I 'm shaking at the prospect of not having any cheese - rolling , " she said .
" It is one of our biggest raisers of funds for the business , particularly this year when we 're desperately trying to increase our premises . "
Inspector Stephen Norris , of Gloucestershire Constabulary , said the police and Gloucestershire County Council had been working with the event 's organisers , the Cooper 's Hill Cheese Rolling Committee ( CHCRC ) and advising them on how to create a safer event .
He added : " A vote was held by the CHCRC as to whether the 2010 event should go ahead .
Their decision was to postpone this year 's event .
" Gloucestershire Constabulary and our partner agencies will continue to advise and work with the organisers of the Cooper 's Hill Cheese Rolling to examine what changes can be made for the event to go ahead in 2011 . "
Gloucestershire County Councillor Mark Hawthorne said he would get in touch with the organisers to see if there was anything the council could do " to help get this great Gloucestershire event back on track " .
" Cheese - rolling has been going on for hundreds of years and we must ensure that this great tradition continues , " he added .

Fathers worried about new lovers of their ex-partners are top users of Sarah's Law
Fathers worried about the new boyfriends of the mothers of their children are using the controversial ' Sarah 's law ' to check up on them , it was revealed today .
Figures show they made the largest number of queries during a year - long pilot of the warning system , which the Government today said is now going nationwide .
The new disclosure rules allow worried parents , relatives and neighbours to ask police if a person they were concerned about has a history of child sex abuse .
It was predicted many of the requests for information would come from women concerned about the history of their new partners .
But police found nearly one in five applications were from fathers asking about a new lover in their former partner 's life .
Sarah Payne 's mother Sara campaigned for a new law after her daughter was killed by a convicted paeodophile
Testing of the scheme began in September 2008 and involved the Cambridgeshire , Cleveland , Hampshire and Warwickshire police forces .
It is a watered - down version of laws in the US where details of where convicted paedophiles live are actively publicised .
Sara Payne , whose daughter Sarah was killed by convicted paedophile Roy Whiting in July 2000 , led a high - profile campaign calling for a British equivalent .
HOW IT WORKS
Sarah 's Law , brought in after a campaign by Sara Payne ( right ) covers the five main categories below .
Parents , carers or guardians can ask if someone with access to their child has a record of sex offences , while other relatives can also alert police , though information will only be given to parents or guardians .
BOYFRIEND - MOTHER'S WORRIES
A single mother starts a new relationship but is worried she does not know enough about the man to allow him fully into her life .
If the man has a criminal record for sex offences and police deem him a serious risk , they can pass on some of this information to the mother .
But they will only do so if they are convinced it is ' necessary and proportionate ' to protect the children .
Information about other worrying behaviour , such as a conviction for domestic violence , or even unproven complaints of abuse may also be passed on .
BOYFRIEND - FAMILY WORRIES
A couple have suspicions about their daughter 's new boyfriend and the risk he poses to their grandchildren .
Like anyone else , they can already alert the police .
However , as they are not directly responsible for the welfare of the children any relevant information would only go to the mother .
THE FRIENDLY NEIGHBOUR
The neighbour who plays with children : in this case , police would only release information to parents if the man has direct access .
They may have a difficult balancing act to perform if they know the neighbour is an offender , but there is no reason to suggest he poses a risk because he is already co-operating with monitoring arrangements .
THE UNFRIENDLY NEIGHBOUR
If a family is concerned that a neighbour appears untrustworthy , is reclusive and is always rude , police are highly unlikely to provide any information because they have not been provided reasonable suspicion that children are at risk .
THE SPORTS COACH
Parents could ask about a local man who has been offering informal football coaching , but does n't seem to be part of any club , leisure centre or school setup .
If he is found to be a risk , the parent would be told but asked to keep that information to themselves .
Monitoring arrangements would then come into action .
If he poses no risk and has simply been a little naive , police may advise him how to avoid any future misunderstandings , such as by ensuring that he can provide an up - to - date criminal record check .
One in ten of all applications during the trial uncovered the hidden criminal past of a person with access to children .
They included paedophiles who had breached the terms of the Sex Offender Register .
Under the Home Office scheme parents can ask the police about anyone with access to their children and officers will reveal details confidentially if they think it is in the child 's interests .
Police may also warn parents if concerns are raised by grandparents or neighbours .
Mrs Payne , who is now the Government 's official Victims ' Champion , and is recovering from brain surgery , welcomed the extension of the scheme .
In a statement , she said : ' I am delighted that the years of campaigning and hard work by so many friends and colleagues have provided those who care for children with the right to check that adults who have access to them do not pose a danger .
' The evaluation has shown the huge benefits of increased but controlled access to information . '
Neighbours , other family members and friends were the other main subjects of inquiries .
The forces involved in the pilot were not deluged with requests as was feared .
Worries that paedophiles would disappear underground en masse and that the revelations would result in vigilante justice were also not realised , police said .
A total of 315 applications for information were made to the four forces .
From those details of 21 paedophiles were revealed .
Details of 11 individuals with different criminal pasts such as violence were also divulged .
An academic study into the results of the pilots said they strengthened existing controls on sex offenders .
In one case a neighbour giving sweets to youngsters was found to be a paedophile .
He was arrested for breaching a court order which barred him from contact with children .
Chief Constable Paul West from the Association of Chief Police Officers said police would now contact all the paedophiles living in the UK to inform them the scheme was being extended .
He said : ' There has been no evidence to suggest that any registered sex offenders in the areas have gone missing and been driven underground .
' The preparation for rolling out the process involved meeting every registered sex offender in the area to explain this was n't going to be a public outing and it was n't going to be front page news in the local paper .
I think this gave a lot of reassurance .'
There are currently 32,336 registered sex offenders in England and Wales .
The scheme will begin in 18 new force areas from August , the Home Office said .
It will then extend across England and Wales from March 2011 .
Home Secretary Alan Johnson said : ' I am determined to do all I can to protect children and families from sex offenders .
' The UK already has one of the most robust systems in the world for the management of sex offenders .
The new scheme will build on this , ensuring more children are kept safe . '
While Jerome David ( J.D. )
Salinger died more than a month ago , on January 27 , it is still difficult for me to talk about him in the past tense .
I expect that his books have something to do with that — the way they play with time .
Yet as the accolades multiplied in the days after his demise , one thing that struck me was the almost telephoto - focus on a single novel , his 1951 classic , The Catcher in the Rye .
And the most important thing to observe about The Catcher in the Rye , is that it is the only non-explicitly religious book Salinger , a restless religious seeker , ever wrote .
There is no question but that this book has become an almost inescapable part of the implicit New American canon ; scarcely a ninth or tenth grader in the land has n’t been forced to read it .
I was assigned the book in the snowy winter months of my freshman year in high school and I had the supreme good fortune of being taught the book by a very serious , and highly imaginative , scholar of American literature .
He did not let the class neglect the crucial detail , revealed near the book ’s end , that our stalwart narrator has been confined to a sanitorium , and may not be quite the trustworthy reporter he would have us believe him to be .
So the book was far more than a manifesto for the mid-teen audience horrified by the overwhelming influence of “ phonies ” in the adult world .
It was a cautionary tale about what seeing through the charade may cost the sensitive soul who fails to conform to the anti-Platonic realm of the phonies .
Salinger ’s was a wiser and more knowing glimpse into the radicalism of the 1960s that lay not so very far in the country ’s collective future .
Salinger laid the spiritual foundations for a counterculture .
He was a mystic , pure and simple .
The most enduring moment in The Catcher in the Rye is the one thing that seems able to tame even a hardened cynic like Holden Caufield : an encounter with the innocence of childhood , especially children at play .
It is this quest for lost innocence that defines the spiritual trajectory of Salinger ’s most memorable characters .
They are all teachers , parents , players , children - at - heart .
Most of those characters come from the storied Glass family , the surprising brood produced by an old vaudeville family from Manhattan ’s Upper East Side ( the East 70s , to be exact … the museum district ) .
Bessie ( née Gallagher , though this family , if ever there were one , was a matriarchy ) and Les Glass were both performers , but they landed their greatest role and expressed their deepest creativity in the children they produced .
There were seven in all , but first among them was the eldest son , Seymour ( that ’s right , See - More - Glass , the son of Less - Glass ) .
Seymour was , literally from the moment he could read ( a very early moment in his case ) , the poet and spiritual adept who charted out the path along which each of the other Glass children , half Jewish and half Irish , would find their way .
Born in 1917 , and a voracious reader of everything he could lay hands and heart upon — the Upanishads and Diamond Sutra , Meister Eckhart and Sappho , all the Christian gospels , the Tao Te Ching and Mencius , Søren Kierkegaard and Anton Chekhov — Seymour Glass also found the perfect role for himself on a radio talk - show called “ It ’s A Wise Child . ”
Every one of the Glass children starred on that show , dominating the airwaves with childlike wisdom , from 1927 through 1943 when the youngest of the clan , Franny , signed off for the very last time .
The Glass children , that is to say , found their spiritual careers bookended by the World Wars .
Then they took their radio profits and went to college , each one in their turn .
You see Salinger ’s point ; no GI Bill in this family ; spirituality paved their ways to a degree .
We learn most of what we know about the Glass family in Salinger ’s most important book , Franny and Zooey , published in 1961 , but set in 1955 .
Here are the highlights : Seymour committed suicide shortly after the War , in 1948 , and that loss dominated the entire subsequent career of the siblings .
It led to the almost compulsive attempts by the second son , Buddy , to capture some shard of Seymour ’s wisdom in words .
He was a writer - in - residence at a small women ’s college in upstate New York .
Boo Boo was a married mother of three , and the twins , Walt and Walker were , respectively , an accidental casualty of the occupation of Japan and a Jesuit priest working in South America .
Zooey ( Zachary Martin Glass ) was an aspiring actor in 1955 , and the youngest daughter , Franny , was on leave from her college due to a spiritual malaise that brought her to the brink of a nervous breakdown .
An intensely neurotic family .
Also intensely brilliant , intensely attuned , and intensely committed to one another .
What prompted Franny ’s crisis was her introduction to the Russian Orthodox classics , The Way of the Pilgrim and The Pilgrim Continues His Way .
These devotional texts relate the story of an illiterate Russian peasant who learns the “ Jesus Prayer ” and comes to realize that the meditative reiteration of this prayer was what Paul had in mind when he urged his readers to “ pray without ceasing . ”
As the pilgrim internalizes the prayer , his pilgrim ’s path unfolds with clarity .
Franny , tempted to the prayer , has come home emaciated and exhausted from her spiritual labors .
In the end , Zooey reminds her of a story that Seymour was fond of telling the siblings , a way to encourage them to return to the radio show when they did n’t feel like it .
Reminding her of this story , Zooey helps Franny to recall the this - worldly mysticism to which their brother had called them .
They could enact these subtle truths as easily on the Upper East Side as anywhere .
We learn more about Seymour himself in the other book , or rather , the two novellas that were published together as a book in 1963 .
The first of the two , “ Raise High the Roof Beam , Carpenters , ” is actually a quote from one of the fragments of Sappho , the Archaic Greek poetess Plato deemed “ the tenth muse . ”
The line comes from one of Sappho ’s wedding songs , which is fitting , since this one relates the story of Seymour ’s engagement to a stunning beauty who seems really not to understand him ( who , we are put to wonder , ever could ? ) .
Seymour calls off the wedding “ because he is too happy , ” and then later that evening the couple elopes , leaving Buddy holding the bag but also with an important story to tell .
The next piece , “ Seymour , An Introduction , ” represents the one time when Buddy really tries to come to terms with his brother ’s mystic path in something other than storyteller ’s terms .
But it is the stories that grab you .
Salinger describes Seymour ’s final day in a marvelous short story , “ A Perfect Day for Bananafish ” ( from his 1953 collection , Nine Stories ) .
Yet what is assuredly the most disturbing story in the collection is the ninth one , “ Teddy . ”
This one tells the tale of yet one more “ wise child , ” a spiritual adept who is far enough evolved as to recall his prior incarnations .
He also knows that the karmic wheel has dictated that this time around he is destined to be killed by his younger sister , who will push him into an empty pool on a cruise ship .
In fact , the child cuts short an interview in order to keep his date with disaster , and the story , like the book , ends with a scream .
These are very hard stories , and Salinger ’s is a very hard world .
It seems important to keep in mind how World Wars bookend the narrative world he went to such lengths to create , and that his own writerly career was more or less bookended by the end of the Second War and the beginning of the Civil Rights movement .
Yet the quest that Seymour set for his siblings , a quest apparently best captured by a posthumous collection of 184 short poems we never see , was a quest for happiness , the very thing he never figured out .
Seymour Glass clearly felt that you could be “ too happy ” ( perhaps ‘ serene ’ is a better word for the state he wished to cultivate ) .
Buddy swerved from that path .
Perhaps .
Oh this happiness is strong stuff .
It ’s marvelously liberating .
I ’m free , I feel , to tell you exactly what you must be longing to hear now .
That is , if as I know you do , you love best in this world those little beings of pure spirit with a natural temperature of 125 , then it naturally follows that the creature you love next best is the person — the God - knower or God-hater ( almost never apparently anything in between ) , the saint or profligate , moralist or complete immoralist — who can write a poem that is a poem .
Among human beings , he ’s the curlew sandpiper , and I hasten to tell you what little I presume to know about his flights , his heat , his incredible heart .
( “ Seymour , ” 113-114 )
After this burst of spiritual and quasi- scriptural energy spanning roughly a decade , Salinger fell silent .
Theories abound as to why .
He ran out of things to say .
He felt that he ’d said everything he could responsibly say .
He felt that publishing was just “ a damned interruption . ”
I ’ve even heard that he stopped writing under his own name and started writing under another — Thomas Pynchon is the most intriguing hypothesis I ever heard .
The main thing people who take his work seriously wonder about is the degree to which Salinger worried that to write anymore about such deep and impenetrable topics would be to risk the very phoniness that shattered Holden and Seymour both , in the end .
Salinger doubtless found some of the New Age syrupy and superficial , whereas his own version of written spiritual exercises was hard - nosed and irreverent .
He knew that the task of the maturing self was to let the self go , to clear it out in order to make room for spirit to enter .
When Zooey Glass was trying to find his own way , the only alternative to the theater he seriously considered was a PhD in ancient Greek .
Sappho ’s poetry and Plato ’s philosophy haunt these pages .
Salinger knew well that these Greek traditions were fundamentally religious in nature , a point still lost on far too many contemporary readers .
( A marvelous exception is Anne Carson ; if you want to see what Seymour - like poetry might look like , then read any of her books , but especially Eros the Bittersweet and her more recent work , Decreation ) .
Plato , it is important to recall , famously admitted in the so - called Seventh Letter that he never wrote what he most believed , because words do not lend themselves to that kind of thing .
Franny and Zooey is a play on some important Greek words , meaning something like “ mind and life , ” or “ thinking and living . ”
The point is not to let the thinking trump the living .
Zooey , the living , helps Franny , the thinking , find her peace .
And so Salinger fell silent , entering a nearly hermetic existence that stayed with him , so we imagine , to the end .
If he wrote more as he saw more , we never knew .
Likely we will see new manuscripts in print in the near future ( several unpublished collections of short stories already circulate ) .
Perhaps the best way , the only way , to end this is the way Salinger ended his Seymour reflections … not with the gunshot in a short story , but with Buddy ’s final words at novella ’s end .
One of the thousand reasons I quit going to the theater when I was about twenty was that I resented like hell filing out of the theater just because some playwright was forever slamming down his silly curtain .
( What ever became of that stalwart Fortinbras ?
Who eventually fixed his wagon ? )
Nonetheless , I ’m done here …
Seymour once said that all we do our whole lives is go from one piece of Holy Ground to the next .
Is he never wrong ?
Just go to bed , now .
Quickly .
Quickly and slowly .
( “ Seymour , ” 212-213 )
Perhaps saying good night is a more tolerable way of saying good - bye to those we love , and lose .
Reading
In the cities in which we live , all of us see hundreds of publicity images every day of our lives .
No other kind of image confronts us so frequently .
In no other form of society in history has there been such a concentration of images , such a density of visual messages .
One may remember or forget these messages but briefly one takes them in , and for a moment they stimulate the imagination by way of either memory or expectation .
The publicity image belongs to the moment .
We see it as we turn a page , as we turn a corner , as a vehicle passes us .
Or we see it on a television screen while waiting for the commercial break to end .
Publicity images also belong to the moment in the sense that they must be continually renewed and made up - to - date .
Yet they never speak of the present .
Often they refer to the past and always they speak of the future .
We are now so accustomed to being addressed by these images that we scarcely notice their total impact .
A person may notice a particular image or piece of information because it corresponds to some particular interest he has .
But we accept the total system of publicity images as we accept an element of climate .
For example , the fact that these images belong to the moment but speak of the future produces a strange effect which has become so familiar that we scarcely notice it .
Usually it is we who pass the image - walking , travelling , turning a page ; on the TV screen it is somewhat different but even then we are theoretically the active agent - we can look away , turn down the sound , make some coffee .
Yet despite this , one has the impression that publicity images are continually passing us , like express trains on their way to some distant terminus .
We are static ; they are dynamic - until the newspaper is thrown away , the television program continues or the paster is posted over .
Publicity is usually explained and justified as a competitive medium which ultimately benefits the public ( the consumer ) and the most efficient manufacturers - and thus the national economy .
It is closely related to certain ideas about freedom : freedom of choice for the purchaser : freedom of enterprise for the manufacturer .
The great hoardings and the publicity neons of the cities of capitalism are the immediate visible sign of " The Free World . "
For many in Eastern Europe such images in the West sum up what they in the East lack .
Publicity , it is thought , offers a free choice .
It is true that in publicity one brand of manufacture , one firm , competes with another ; but it is also true that every publicity image confirms and enhances every other .
Publicity is not merely an assembly of competing messages : it is a language in itself which is always being used to make the same general proposal .
Within publicity , choices are offered between this cream and that cream , that car and this car , but publicity as a system only makes a single proposal .
It proposes to each of us that we transform ourselves , or our lives , by buying something more .
This more , it proposes , will make us in some way richer - even though we will be poorer by having spent our money .
Publicity persuades us of such a transformation by showing us people who have apparently been transformed and are , as a result , enviable .
The state of being envied is what constitutes glamour .
And publicity is the process of manufacturing glamour .
It is important here not to confuse publicity with the pleasure or benefits to be enjoyed from the things it advertises .
Publicity is effective precisely because it feeds upon the real .
Clothes , food , cars , cosmetics , baths , sunshine are real things to be enjoyed in themselves .
Publicity begins by working on a natural appetite for pleasure .
But it cannot offer the real object of pleasure and there is no convincing substitute for a pleasure in that pleasure 's own terms .
The more convincingly publicity conveys the pleasure of bathing in a warm , distant sea , the more the spectator - buyer will become aware that he is hundreds of miles away from that sea and the more remote the chance of bathing in it will seem to him .
This is why publicity can never really afford to be about the product or opportunity it is proposing to the buyer who is not yet enjoying it .
Publicity is never a celebration of a pleasure - in - itself .
Publicity is always about the future buyer .
It offers him an image of himself made glamorous by the product or opportunity it is trying to sell .
The image then makes him envious of himself as he might be .
Yet what makes this self - which - he - might - be enviable ?
The envy of other .
Publicity is about social relations , not objects .
Its promise is not of pleasure , but of happiness : happiness as judged from the outside by others .
The happiness of being envied is glamour .
Being envied is a solitary form of reassurance .
It depends precisely upon not sharing your experience with those who envy you .
You are observed with interest but you do not observe with interest - if you do , you will become less enviable .
In this respect the envied are like bureaucrats ; the more impersonal they are , the greater the illusion ( for themselves and for others ) of their power .
The power of the glamorous resides in their supposed happiness : the power of the bureaucrat in his supposed authority .
It is this which explains the absent , unfocused look of so many glamour images .
The look out over the looks of envy which sustain them .
The spectator - buyer is meant to envy herself as she will become if she buys the product .
She is meant to imagine herself transformed by the product into an object of envy for others , an envy which will then justify her loving herself .
One could put this another way : the publicity image steals her love of herself as she is , and offers it back to her for the price of the product .
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Publicity is the culture of the consumer society .
It propagates through images that society 's belief in itself .
There are several reasons why these images use the language of oil painting .
Oil painting , before it was anything else , was a celebration of private property .
As an art - form it derived from the principle that you are what you have .
It is a mistake to think of publicity supplanting the visual art of post - Renaissance Europe ; it is the last moribund form of that art .
Publicity is , in essence , nostalgic .
It has to sell the past to the future .
It can not itself supply the standards of its own claims .
And so all its references to quality are bound to be retrospective and traditional .
It would lack both confidence and credibility if it used a strictly contemporary language .
Publicity needs to turn to its own advantage the traditional education of the average spectator - buyer .
What he has learnt at school of history , mythology , poetry can be used in the manufacturing of glamour .
Cigars can be sold in the name of a King , underwear in connection with the Sphinx , a new car by reference to the status of a country house .
In the language of oil painting these vague historical or poetic references are always present .
The fact that they are imprecise and ultimately meaningless is an advantage : they should not be understandable , they should merely be reminiscent of cultural lessons half - learnt .
Publicity makes all history mythical , but to do so effectively it needs a visual language with historical dimensions .
Lastly , a technical development made it easy to translate the language of oil painting into publicity cliches .
This was the invention , about fifteen years ago , of cheap color photography .
Such photography can reproduce the color and texture and tangibility of objects as only oil paint had been able to do before .
Color photography is to the spectator - buyer what oil paint was to the spectator - owner .
Both media use similar , highly tactile means to play upon the spectator 's sense of acquiring the real thing which the image shows .
In both cases his feeling that he can almost touch what is in the image reminds him how he might or does possess the real thing .
Yet , despite this continuity of language , the function of publicity is very different from that of the oil painting .
The spectator - buyer stands in a very different relation to the world from the spectator - owner .
The oil painting showed what its owner was already enjoying among his possessions and his way of life .
It consolidated his own sense of his own value .
It enhanced his view of himself as he already was .
It began with facts , the facts of his life .
The paintings embellished the interior in which he actually lived .
The purpose of publicity is to make the spectator marginally dissatisfied with his present way of life .
Not with the way of life of society , but with his own within it .
It suggests that if he buys what it is offering , his life will become better .
It offers him an improved alternative to what he is .
The oil painting was addressed to those who made money out of the market .
Publicity is addressed to those who constitute the market , to the spectator - buyer who is also the consumer - producer from whom profits are made twice over - as worker and then as buyer .
The only places relatively free of publicity are the quarters of the very rich ; their money is theirs to keep .
All publicity works upon anxiety .
The sum of everything is money , to get money is to overcome anxiety .
Alternatively the anxiety on which publicity plays is the fear that having nothing you will be nothing .
Money is life .
Not in the sense that without money you starve .
Not in the sense that capital gives one class power over the entire lives of another class .
But in the sense that money is the token of , and the key to , every human capacity .
The power to spend money is the power to live .
According to the legends of publicity , those who lack the power to spend money become literally faceless .
Those who have the power become loveable .
Publicity increasingly uses sexuality to sell any product or service .
But this sexuality is never free in itself ; it is a symbol of something presumed to be larger than it : the good life in which you can buy whatever you want .
To be able to buy is the same thing as being sexually desirable ; occasionally this is the explicit message of publicity , usually it is the implicit message , i.e. if you are able to buy this product you will be lovable .
If you can not buy it , you will be less lovable .
For publicity the present is by definition insufficient .
The oil painting was thought of as a permanent record .
One of the pleasures a painting gave to its owner was the thought that it would convey the image of his present to the future of his descendants .
Thus the oil painting was naturally painted in the present tense .
The painter painted what was before him , either in reality or in imagination .
The publicity image which is ephemeral uses only the future tense .
With this you WILL become desirable .
In these surroundings all your relationships WILL become happy and radiant .
Publicity principally addressed to the working class tends to promise a personal transformation through the function of the particular product it is selling ( Cinderella ) ; middle - class publicity promises a transformation of relationships through a general atmosphere created by an ensemble of products ( The Enchanted Palace ) .
Publicity speaks in the future tense and yet the achievement of this future is endlessly deferred .
How then does publicity remain credible - or credible enough to exert the influence it does ?
It remains credible because the truthfulness of publicity is judged , not by the real fulfillment of its promises , but by the relevance of its fantasies to those of the spectator - buyer .
Its essential application is not to reality but to day - dreams .
To understand this better me must go back to the notion of glamour .
Glamour is a modern invention .
In the heyday of the oil painting it did not exist .
Ideas of grace , elegance , authority amounted to something apparently similar but fundamentally different .
Mrs. Siddons as seen by Gainsborough is not glamorous , because she is not presented as enviable and therefore happy .
She may be seen as wealthy , beautiful , talented , lucky .
But her qualities are her own and have been recognized as such .
What she is does not entirely depend upon others ' envy - which is how , for example , Andy Warhol presents Marilyn Monroe .
Glamour cannot exist without personal social envy being a common and widespread emotion .
The industrial society which has moved towards democracy and then stopped half way is the ideal society for generating such an emotion .
The pursuit of individual happiness has been acknowledged as a universal right .
Yet the existing social conditions make the individual feel powerless .
He lives in the contradiction between what he is and what he would like to be .
Either he then becomes fully conscious of the contradiction and its causes , and so joins the political struggle for a full democracy which entails , amongst other thing , the overthrow of capitalism ; or else he lives , continually subject to an envy which , compounded with his sense of powerlessness , dissolves into recurrent day - dreams .
It is this which makes it possible to understand why publicity remains credible .
The gap between what publicity actually offers and the future it promises , corresponds with the gap between what the spectator - buyer feels himself to be and what he would like to be .
The two gaps become one ; and instead of the single gap being bridged by action or lived experience , it is filled with glamorous day - dreams .
The process is often reinforced by working conditions .
The interminable present of mean - ingless working hours is " balanced " by a dreamt future in which imaginary activity replaces the passivity of the moment .
In his or her day - dreams the passive worker becomes the active consumer .
The working self envies the consuming self .
No two dreams are the same .
Some are instantaneous , others prolonged , The dream is always personal to the dreamer .
Publicity does not manufacture the dream .
All that it does is to propose to each one of us that we are not yet enviable - yet could be .
Publicity has another important social function .
The fact that this function has not been planned as a purpose by those who make and use publicity in no way lessens its significance .
Publicity turns consumption into a substitute for democracy .
The choice of what one eats ( or wears or drives ) takes the place of significant political choice .
Publicity helps to mask and compensate for all that is undemocratic within society .
And it also masks what is happening in the rest of the world .
Publicity adds up to a kind of philosophical system .
It explains everything in its own terms .
It interprets the world .
The entire world becomes a setting for the fulfillment of publicity 's promise of the good life .
The world smiles at us .
It offers itself to us .
And because everywhere is imagined as offering itself to us , everywhere is more or less the same .
The contrast between publicity 's interpretation of the world and the world 's actual condition is a very stark one , and this sometimes becomes evident in the color magazines which deal with news stories .
Overleaf is the contents page of such a magazine .
The sock of such contrasts is considerable : not only because of the coexistence of the two worlds shown , but also because of the cynicism of the culture which shows them one above the other .
It can be argues that the juxtaposition of images was not planned .
Nevertheless the text , the photographs taken in Pakistan , the photographs taken for the advertisements , the editing of the magazine , the layout of the publicity , the printing of both , the fact that advertiser 's pages and news pages cannot be co-ordinated - all these are produced by the same culture .
It is not , however , the moral shock of the contrast which needs emphasizing .
Advertisers themselves can take account of the shock .
The Advertisers Weekly ( 3 March 1972 ) reports that some publicity firms , now aware of the commercial danger of such unfortunate juxtapositions in new magazines , are deciding to use less brash , more somber images , often in black and white rather than color .
What we need to realize is what such contrasts reveal about the nature of publicity .
Publicity is essentially eventless .
It extends just as far as nothing else is happening .
For publicity all real events are exceptional and happen only to strangers .
In the BanglaDesh photographs , the events were tragic and distant .
But the contrast would have been no less stark if they had been events near at hand in Derry or Birmingham .
Nor is the contrast necessarily dependent upon the events being tragic .
If they are tragic , their tragedy alerts our moral sense to the contrast .
Yet if the events were joyous and if they were photographed in a direct and unstereotyped way the contrast would be just as great .
Publicity , situated in a future continually deferred , excludes the present and so eliminates all becoming , all development .
Experience is impossible within it .
All that happens , happens outside it .
The fact that publicity is eventless would be immediately obvious if it did not use a language which makes of tangibility an event in itself .
Everything publicity shows is there awaiting acquisition .
The act of acquiring has taken the place of all other actions , the sense of having has obliterated all other senses .
Publicity exerts an enormous influence and is a political phenomenon of great importance .
But its offer is as narrow as its references are wide .
It recognizes nothing except the power to acquire .
All other human faculties or needs are made subsidiary to this power .
All hopes are gathered together , made homogeneous , simplified , so that they become the intense yet vague , magical yet repeatable promise offered in every purchase .
No other kind of hope or satisfaction or pleasure can any longer be envisaged within the culture of capitalism .
Publicity is the life of this culture - in so far as without publicity capitalism could not survive - and at the same time publicity is its dream .
Capitalism survives by forcing the majority , whom it exploits , to define their own interests as narrowly as possible .
This was once achieved by extensive deprivation .
Today in the developed countries it is being achieved by imposing a false standard of what is and what is not desirable .
A storm of protest hit Google last week over Buzz , its new social networking service , because of user concerns about the inadvertent exposure of their data .
Internet users in Iran , however , were spared such trouble .
It 's not because Google took extra care in protecting their identities — they did n't — but because the Iranian authorities decided to ban Gmail , Google 's popular email service , and replace it with a national email system that would be run by the government .
Such paradoxes abound in the Islamic Republic 's complex relationship ...
Sewage - treatment workers earn an average of about $ 42,000 a year , a figure unchanged since 2001 .
Los Angeles pays a starting salary of $ 71,000 for similar work .
The other union , Local 3 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers , declined to discuss the status of its effort .
It represents two categories of workers at the plants , including the plant managers , who have not seen a cost - of - living raise since 1995 and make an average of $ 59,600 a year — less than many of the people they supervise .
“ That ’s a travesty , ” said Frank Esposito , a plant manager who retired this month after 36 years with the Department of Environmental Protection .
“ But in the last 10 years , we turned around the Hudson River and the East River .
And you never heard about us causing a job action .
That ’s what I ’m proud of .
We did our jobs . ”
The job today is a mix of old - world toil and a modern technician ’s skills .
Raw sewage flows into the 14 treatment plants scattered around the city ’s waterfront .
Solid matter settles in holding tanks and is sold as fertilizer .
The remaining water undergoes treatment before being released into the surrounding waterways .
The workers take federally required water and solid - matter samples at specific intervals .
They monitor levels of dangerous gases , including methane and hydrogen sulfide , and handle chemical and biological agents .
That predictable routine goes on every day .
But the workers are also the jack - of - all - trades repairmen when something goes wrong .
They perform emergency repairs on climate control systems , chlorination devices and huge pumps .
Most come from construction backgrounds ; they must have skills in plumbing , welding , masonry and carpentry .
They take holding tanks off line and wade in to perform repairs .
“ I ’ve been knee deep in raw sewage at 7:15 in the morning , and let me tell you , it do n’t smell like Folgers in your cup , ” said Anthony Mongiello , who has been in the job for nine years .
“ That is one of those smells you just do n’t get used to . ”

The Reckoning
Wherever Blair goes , our campaign ensures that he can never be free from the fear of arrest
By George Monbiot .
Published in the Guardian 2nd February 2010
What else can you do ?
When the entire administration is engaged in a criminal act , when there is no clear separation of powers between the government and the judiciary , when those appointed to hold the government to account are as scary as a litter of kittens , where do you turn ?
Do you appeal to the Attorney - General ’s office to prosecute itself ?
The forensic failure of the Chilcot Inquiry illustrates what we learnt from the banking scandals : self - regulation does n’t work .
The independence of the inquiry is as stark a lie as any of the claims made by its star witness .
In truth this panel of pussycats is a quango appointed and instructed by the prime minister , who will himself appear as a witness .
If ever you needed more evidence that the power of the prime minister ’s office is insufficiently defined in the United Kingdom , here it is .
So you can mock our feeble attempts to hold Tony Blair to account , but only if you propose an alternative .
Last Friday ’s hearings show that there will be no justice , no reckoning from the organs of the state .
Encouraging citizens ’ arrests of Tony Blair for the crime of aggression is perhaps the only remaining option we have , and the astonishing response to the campaign I launched last week shows that many people understand this .
In 30 hours , before Paypal blocked the account without notice , the bounty fund at www.arrestblair.org, which rewards people trying to arrest the former prime minister for crimes against peace , cleared £ 9000 .
Since then it has been harder to produce a running total , but further pledges , electronic transfers and Tipit contributions amount to several thousand pounds more , and are still coming in at the rate of hundreds of pounds a day .
The volume of correspondence has been overwhelming too : it will take weeks to reply to all the pledges and letters of support .
There is a massive public appetite to see justice done .
Already the campaign has borne fruit .
Outside the Chilcot Inquiry a woman called Grace McCann , inspired by the website , tried to apprehend Mr Blair , before she was restrained and removed by the police ( 1 ) .
She qualifies for the first bounty : one quarter of the total pot at the time of her attempt .
She has pledged to give the money to relevant charities .
The fund will remain open for as long as Blair lives or until he is officially prosecuted , and we will keep paying out to those who follow Grace ’s example .
Two main arguments have been deployed against this campaign .
The most surprising was produced by Polly Toynbee in her column on Saturday .
“ Calling in judges to override the decisions of a democratically elected government backed by parliament is a dangerous road , leading to the demise of politics … there is no other authority and we undermine it at our peril .
Politics is already at a low ebb : sending political decisions to be over - ridden by the courts would do nothing to restore credibility .
” ( 2 )
This is a weird form of liberal exceptionalism .
Because enthusiasm for politics has declined , she argues , there should be no limits to state power , except those ordained by the state .
It is precisely because we no longer believe that the government can be held to account that we have become so disillusioned with politics .
In a country like the United Kingdom – where executive power is constitutionally unlimited , the prime minister can bully , mislead and lie to parliament , the Attorney - General is both overseer of the legal system and a minister of the Crown ,
media scrutiny is feeble and partisan and citizens have come to expect nothing better – judicial review is even more important than it is elsewhere .
But in any nation , equality before the law is fundamental to democracy .
Its absence leaves the door wide open to elective dictatorship .
Except in Italy , this is the first time I have seen anyone in a democratic country argue that judges should be able neither to review the decisions of government nor to try its ministers .
I agree with Polly that the legal issue must not obscure the moral issues .
But it does n’t : it highlights them .
Wars of aggression are illegal for a good moral reason : they kill people without justification .
Most of Blair ’s apologists – William Shawcross ( 3 ) , Nick Cohen ( 4 ) , David Blunkett ( 5 ) , John Rentoul ( 6 ) and others – argue that Iraq is a better place now than it was before the war , therefore the war was restrospectively both just and legal .
On the same grounds – the ends justify the means – any number of wars could be excused .
The First World War secured votes for women , allowed the young to challenge a corrupt gerontocracy and began to crack the class system , but you would be hard put to argue that this justified the slaughter in the trenches .
Europe has been a safer and more prosperous place since the conclusion of the Second World War : this does n’t mean that the Axis powers were right to launch it .
To suggest that the murder of somewhere between 100,000 and 1 million people in Iraq , the wounding and mutilation of many more , the collapse of infrastructure and public services and the misrule of the occupying powers is justifed by subsequent partial improvements in the lives of surviving Iraqis is to maintain that the massive tally of death and destruction was a price worth paying .
It is part of the same psychopathic mindset – which reduced human lives to nothing but figures in a political equation – that launched the war .
Nick Cohen ’s argument – that Saddam was a monster and his reign was illegitimate , therefore it was legitimate and legal to remove him – is facile and deeply confused .
He deliberately conflates two meanings of the word legitimate .
I can see that there ’s a case for updating international law to examine the issue of humanitarian intervention , and to decide whether countries might be justified in attacking another to relieve the suffering of its citizens .
But to maintain that states have a right to disregard the current law at their convenience and unilaterally punish another country invites the collapse of an international system that , though flawed , seeks to defend weaker nations from perpetual attack .
This doctrine would permit states to invent justifications for wars of self - interest , just as King Leopold claimed to be liberating the Congo from Arab slavers so that he could enslave it himself , or Saddam Hussein claimed to be saving the region from Shia fundamentalism by bombarding Iran with poison gas .
If you want to invade another nation , a humanitarian reason can always be found .
The arrest campaign cannot right the wrongs of the Iraq war , or even guarantee that Blair is prosecuted for his gigantic crime , but it makes sure that the issue cannot be shuffled away into the dark corners of the national memory .
While Blair can brush off the Chilcot panel , this bounty fund ensures that he will never rid himself of accountability for his actions .
It shows governments that they may no longer destroy people ’s lives and expect us to forget .

Newark , New Jersey ( CNN ) --
If he had n't been an obedient son , and if his father had n't been looking out for him , police say , another teen probably would have disappeared with his friends in Newark the night of August 20 , 1978 .
Roderick Royster had joined other teenagers in the back of a pickup truck that evening , but when his father told him to get out , he did .
The five who left in the truck have never been seen again .
It 's a mystery that has persisted for 32 years .
But this week , police and prosecutors announced the arrests of Lee Anthony Evans , 56 , and his cousin , Philander Hampton , 53 , who have been charged with five counts of murder , as well as arson .
Both have pleaded not guilty .
They are accused of killing Melvin Pittman , 17 , Ernest Taylor , 17 , Alvin Turner , 16 , Randy Johnson , 16 , all of Newark , and Michael McDowell , 16 , of East Orange .
Royster , who was 16 at the time , said he had already hopped onto Evans ' pickup truck when his father ordered him and his brother to go home .
" He says , ' Get off that truck , ' " he recalled in a brief phone interview .
Royster , whose recollection was that his brother was on the truck with him , said they both obeyed and got out of the truck .
( Investigators have referred to Roderick Royster as " number six " in the case , but never have mentioned his brother . )
" I was happy they finally got [ Evans ] , " Royster said .
He said he " always knew " who was responsible .
" It 's been 32 years and it 's about time .
It 's time to get some closure . "
Evans ' attorney , Michael A. Robbins , says his client is innocent , pointing out that Evans cooperated with police in 1978 and passed a polygraph test .
" In a case such as this , where the evidence has been lost , great care must be taken to prevent outrage , anger and emotion acting as a substitute in court for competent testimony , evidence and proof , " Robbins said in a statement .
According to authorities , the defendants led the teens into an abandoned house , killed them and set the building on fire .
No trace of them was ever found .
At the time , Newark was full of abandoned buildings .
So many caught fire -- 2,600 of them in 1978 -- that firefighters would let the vacant ones burn , said Lt. Louis Carrega , of the Essex County Prosecutor 's office .
" From what I understand , they were not going to vacant buildings , " Carrega said .
" They would not send firefighters into vacant buildings . "
For 32 years , the case of the " Clinton Avenue Five , " as it came to be known , haunted the boys ' families and police .
None of the teens were likely runaways .
None had police records .
A break in the case came about 18 months ago when a witness came to detectives with information that the arson of one abandoned building in 1978 was connected to the case .
Although it took detectives three decades , Royster and relatives of the victims said they never doubted that Evans was responsible .
" We were right , we were right all along , said Michael McDowell 's sister , Terry Lawson .
" In all these 30 years , we knew it was him . "
Back then , Evans , a hulking 25 - year - old , was known by another name in the neighborhood .
" They called him Big Man , " said Jack Eutsey , a former Newark police detective who investigated the case for the Essex County Prosecutor 's Office .
" He was big and he was tall .
He had a reputation for being dangerous , " Eutsey added .
Floria McDonald recalls Evans was " kind of smart and nasty " when she confronted him about her missing son , Alvin Turner .
A neighbor told her she 'd seen Alvin get into Evans ' truck .
McDonald says she confronted him about it the week her son vanished .
" I told him that the children were seen on the back of his truck that night , and he told me he do n't give a damn what nobody says , " she recalled .
Eutsey , the retired detective , described Evans as a contractor who occasionally hired neighborhood teens for odd jobs .
In return , he gave them food , money , and drugs , he said .
Shortly before the boys disappeared , some teenagers broke into Evans ' apartment and stole more than a pound of marijuana , investigators said .
" They crossed him , " Eutsey said , " and they could n't get away from that . "

On the last night they were seen , the boys played basketball and then returned home .
A short time later , Evans drove by and picked up them up , one by one .
They thought they were going to help him move boxes , police said .
Lawson , who was 11 at the time , recalled Evans was wearing blue jeans , construction boots and a blue T - shirt when he arrived to pick up her brother , Michael .
" When Michael came out , I found it strange that he did n't get in from the passenger side , " Lawson recalled .
" Evans got out and Michael went in from the driver 's side and he sat in the middle seat . "
" When they drove off I clearly remember the back of his head and you see Michael and Evans ' head right next to him .
I watched that truck drive down Main Street .
That 's the last time I saw him . "
Evans blended into the background as memories faded for some .
" For the past 32 years he has led an unremarkable life of hard work and taking care of his family , " said Robbins , Evans ' lawyer , " and has had no contact with the criminal justice system . "
But for the boys ' families , the pain remained .
" This devastated my family , " said Lawson .
" My mother was completely devastated .
Every day she would sit in that window and wait for Michael to come home .
She would sit there for hours at night and no one could answer the phone because she was expecting a call from Michael . "
Michael 's mother died of leukemia the year after he disappeared .
Some time during the mid-1980s , Lawson said , she was in the supermarket when her sister pointed out Evans and said , " That 's that guy that took Michael . "
" I looked at him and I just had chills . "
I learnt a new word today “ vague - booking ” .
According to the Urban Dictionary it means “ an intentionally vague Facebook status update , that prompts friends to ask what ’s going on … ”
Personally , I think it ’s a fancy word that ’s means you just want attention .
Now I know that even I have been guilty of vague - booking in the past and I apologise for it , but some people seem to make a professional career out of it .
A popular example of vague - booking :
Person A…is upset .
This leads to people to ask why is Person A upset .
Person
A then replies oh , I ca n’t talk about it , but I ’m sooooo upset .
Which gives Person
A even more attention than before , because it must be bad if they ca n’t talk about it , right ?
That ’s an example of vague - booking .
And that ’s one of my pet peeves .
Seriously , if you do n’t want to give details , do n’t mention it .
AT ALL .
Do n’t drop hints that something horrible has happened and then get pissed off that no one asks what ’s wrong .
Or worse , get upset that everyone asks you what ’s wrong .
If you decide to put it out there , that ’s your choice .
But do n’t get mad when you do it repeatedly and people catch on to your little cries for attention and do n’t give you any .
Most people have a limit to how much sympathy they can give a person before it ’s all gone .
Weekly cries for attention quickly add up and soon there is nothing left for when something bad actually does happen .
Even worse than vague - booking is the other popular status of “ …is cleaning out their friends .
Sorry if you do n’t make the cut . ”
Now , really .
If you have so many friends that you need to announce that you have too many , someone is a little insecure .
Why do people feel the need to announce that you are n’t good enough to be their friend anymore ?
What ever happened to just quietly deleting them and then getting on with your life ?
Is announcing that you ’re getting rid of some people just another attempt at getting more attention ?
Do you think that people are suddenly going to come out of the woodwork and beg to keep your friendship ?
Really ?
Do you really think that you ’re THAT important in the overall scheme of things ?
I have no doubt that some people are reading this , shaking their heads at me , but truthfully , this needed to be said .
The vague - bookers out there may not know it , but they are driving away all their friends and by the time they get around to Stage Two : The Defriending Message , they may find that there ’s not too many people left to defriend .
We would have taken care of that ourselves .
Of course , this could also lead to a mass defriending of Lulu … but do n’t worry , I promise not to post how upset I am and then refuse to talk about it .

That 's the title of a new study by London School of Economics management professor Satoshi Kanazawa just published in Social Psychology Quarterly .
As ScienceDaily explains the professor 's findings :
More intelligent people are statistically significantly more likely to exhibit social values and religious and political preferences that are novel to the human species in evolutionary history .
Specifically , liberalism and atheism , and for men ( but not women ) , preference for sexual exclusivity correlate with higher intelligence , a new study finds … .
In the current study , Kanazawa argues that humans are evolutionarily designed to be conservative , caring mostly about their family and friends , and being liberal , caring about an indefinite number of genetically unrelated strangers they never meet or interact with , is evolutionarily novel .
So more intelligent children may be more likely to grow up to be liberals .
Data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health ( Add Health ) support Kanazawa 's hypothesis .
Young adults who subjectively identify themselves as " very liberal " have an average IQ of 106 during adolescence while those who identify themselves as " very conservative " have an average IQ of 95 during adolescence .
Similarly , religion is a byproduct of humans ' tendency to perceive agency and intention as causes of events , to see " the hands of God " at work behind otherwise natural phenomena .
" Humans are evolutionarily designed to be paranoid , and they believe in God because they are paranoid , " says Kanazawa .
This innate bias toward paranoia served humans well when self - preservation and protection of their families and clans depended on extreme vigilance to all potential dangers .
" So , more intelligent children are more likely to grow up to go against their natural evolutionary tendency to believe in God , and they become atheists . "
Young adults who identify themselves as " not at all religious " have an average IQ of 103 during adolescence , while those who identify themselves as " very religious " have an average IQ of 97 during adolescence ….
One intriguing but theoretically predicted finding of the study is that more intelligent people are no more or no less likely to value such evolutionarily familiar entities as marriage , family , children , and friends .

English Bay Beach goers not already familiar with Cactus Club ’s menu will soon be smelling the french fries following a park board vote on Monday ( March 22 ) paving the way for the restaurant to replace the existing concession .
Commissioners voted 6 - 1 in favour of the move , which will see Cactus Restaurants Ltd. pay $ 240,000 in annual rent — plus four percent of revenue over $ 4 million — to the Vancouver park board , according to a staff report .
Philip Josephs , manager of revenue services for the park board , told commissioners the board will retain ownership of the building , while the private corporation will own the fixtures and furniture , and pay the estimated $ 5 - million cost of building a new two - level eatery .
The establishment will also feature a concession with cheaper takeout items .
The previous English Bay concession netted the board $ 63,000 in 2009 , Josephs said .
“ Being a Vancouver - based company , we are thrilled to have been selected by the Vancouver Park Board to operate a new restaurant at English Bay , ” Richard Jaffray , president and founder of Cactus Restaurants Ltd. , said in a press release .
Speaking passionately and answering every question fired at him at the park board offices on Beach Avenue , Jaffray at one point assured Green commissioner Stuart Mackinnon he would not be unleashing on West Enders an establishment that was “ one step above Hooters " — as Mackinnon had said , quoting an unnamed source .
Mackinnon cast the sole no vote , adding that the Vancouver Green party ’s policy opposed the “ corporate branding ” of public space .
“ We ’ll be looking to Sunset , Second Beach , Locarno , and even Spanish Banks next , ” Mackinnon said .
“ Will we be seeing a Red Lobster or an Earls or even a McDonald ’s at those locations ? ”
Vision Vancouver park board chair Aaron Jasper spoke in opposition to the project as a member of COPE and director of the West End Residents Association three years ago .
However , he said at the Monday meeting that “ consultation was adequate ” and his concerns about affordability had been addressed .
Vision commissioners Raj Hundal , Sarah Blyth , and Constance Barnes ; COPE commissioner Loretta Woodcock ; and NPA commissioner Ian Robertson also voted in favour .
Cactus Club has 20 locations in B.C. and Alberta that produce annual sales of over $ 115 million , according to the staff report .
Underscoring the very real threat that remains of an American war against Iran , White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs today declared that the Obama Administration will not rule out attacking Iran over its decision to enrich uranium to 20 percent .
Gibbs accused Iran of repeatedly refusing administration offers of diplomatic negotiations , declaring this was proof that the Iranian nuclear program is not for civilian purposes .
In fact , Iran and the United States did take part in diplomatic negotiations in October , resulting in the draft enrichment deal .
Iran also offered additional talks in November and December related to the deal , but were rebuffed and condemned by officials for the proposed talks .
Far from refusing to make agreements with the West related to its nuclear program , Iran actually accepted the draft enrichment deal earlier this month , as repeatedly demanded by the Obama Administration .
The acceptance too was roundly condemned by Western officials , though mysteriously many have continued to demand that Iran accept the deal for weeks since the acceptance was already made .
Communications Minister Stephen Conroy has hit back at a new report listing Australia as a potential internet enemy .
Press freedom advocacy group Reporters without Borders released their Enemies of the Internet report last Friday , to coincide with World Day Against Cyber Censorship .
It found Australia should be kept " under surveillance " for signs that internet freedom may soon be curbed .
The federal government wants all internet service providers to ban refused classification material hosted on overseas servers .
Senator Conroy said listing Australia as a country that may be an " enemy of the internet " - alongside South Korea , Turkey and Russia - showed Reporters without Borders were seriously mislead about what Labor wanted to do .
The hottest topic in Ottawa these days ( as it has been for years ) is the Ottawa Senators ' goaltender situation , particularly with the playoffs quickly approaching .
I was going to write a lengthy feature on the current state of Ottawa Senators netminding , but then I remembered that great maxim : can't someone else do it ?
With that in mind , I managed to get the great goalkeeping mind of Justin Goldman to answer some questions for us .
Justin is the founder of great netminder resource The Goalie Guild and a scout for McKeen's .
It 's a very lengthy write - up , but I encourage you to read through it all , because you wo n't find a more in - depth analysis of Ottawa Senators goaltending anywhere on the web or in print .
Justin gives us his thoughts on Pascal Leclaire , Brian Elliott , Mike Brodeur , Robin Lehner , and much , much more .
Enjoy !
Why has Pascal Leclaire underachieved in Ottawa so far ?
Is it attributable to his injury history , or is he simply not as good as his draft spot and 9 shutout season suggested he was ?
Aside from the injuries and bouts with the flu , Leclaire has n’t lived up to expectations this season because of his inability to play with enough consistency in his limited chances .
Not once has he won more than two games in a row all season long .
Whether it was due to being sick , rehabbing or failing to win three in a row , Leclaire has n’t created enough momentum or confidence in his game in order to own the crease .
And without consistent starts , he has been unable to get into a good goaltending rhythm .
Trying to determine where Leclaire ’s current value ranks related to his draft spot is futile because NHL goalies are drafted in every round and many more are undrafted .
One of the most interesting yet difficult aspects of scouting goaltenders is that their rate of development is not only unique to the individual goalie , but it ’s also constantly changing .
Goalies can develop really fast for a few months and then not at all for a few years , or it could be the complete opposite or anywhere in between .
It all just depends on their situation and their day - to - day results .
So where a goalie is drafted does not really matter when it comes to success .
But for argument ’s sake , I would say that Leclaire has failed to live up to his high draft spot .
It ’s not his fault though – injuries are just a part of being human .
It ’s a risk all teams and players take .
I would also say that he should have never been drafted that soon in the first place , but that ’s another story .
His success in Columbus stemmed from being on a young and talented team where head coach Ken Hitchcock employed a strong and structured defensive system .
Leclaire was not facing nearly as many scoring opportunities on average in a game , so therefore it was much easier to perform consistently and he was able to log a ton of minutes and play in a strong rhythm .
That , combined with his relatively good health , allowed him to post such great statistics and so many impressive shutouts .
Without going into too much detail , there ’s also the issue of Leclaire ’s past injuries .
Although I ’m no medical scientist , I have done enough research and talked to enough athletic trainers to know the negative impact a torn meniscus can have on a goalie .
With a position that relies so much on the knees in order to be effective in the butterfly , this is a devastating injury for Leclaire to have suffered .
To be honest , it ’s almost impossible to play exactly the same after a serious meniscus tear .
I ca n’t speak on the severity of Leclaire ’s meniscus tear or ankle injury , but because he ’s a smaller goalie that relies on reflexes , sharp reactions and extreme flexibility to stop pucks , the injuries are impacting his future more than a team would want .
If you 're Cory Clouston , which goalie do you ride until and during the playoffs : Brian Elliott or Pascal Leclaire .
Why ?
( Basically -- who is the better goaltender right now ? )
I would ride Brian Elliott without a doubt .
He ’s a young goaltender that will play better if he ’s given positive reinforcement from the coaching staff , his teammates and even the fans .
The more that the organization gets behind him , the more relaxed and confident he will play .
The key is for the coaches to stay away from negative reinforcement .
If he competes well and makes some timely saves in a tough one - goal loss , that does not mean he should be automatically benched in favor of Leclaire .
At the same time , he should not be rewarded if he makes a lot of mental mistakes or fails to give his team a chance to win .
If Leclaire is able to take advantage of some bad games by Elliott and actually put together more than two solid efforts in a row , the coaching staff would be smart to make their decisions on a day - by - day and practice - by - practice basis .
Whichever goalie plays with more energy , focus and confidence should ultimately start in the hopes once catches fire heading into the playoffs .
If I had to choose one , however , I would easily put my faith in Elliott , as he has continued to develop nicely over the last two years and is capable of going on another long winning streak at any time .
Jonas
Hiller did the same thing last year , but only because the organization recognized the talent and ability was there and they gave Hiller most of the starts over Giguere .
Both Elliott and Leclaire have contracts that expire at the end of next season .
Elliott will be a restricted free agent , Leclaire an unrestricted free agent .
If the Senators can only afford to sign one , who should they go with ?
( Basically , who is the better bet long term ? )
Once next season is halfway over , the organization should have a much clearer picture of Leclaire ’s health and Elliott ’s progression .
In my opinion , I think the future will be very clear .
Leclaire wo n’t be worth the money to re-sign long - term , especially because of his band - aid boy status .
Elliott also makes the most sense to retain because Robin Lehner is the ( very bright ) future of the organization , so it will just be a matter of biding time until he ’s NHL ready .
There ’s no point in spending money on a injury - prone goalie when you can save that cap money , spend less on Elliott and have even more for Lehner .
Where does Mike Brodeur fit into the Senators organization ?
He 's played great in his few NHL call - ups , but will he ever be an NHL goalie ?
Mike Brodeur has been an inspirational story for goaltenders everywhere , including myself .
He ’s an extremely hard - working individual with great mental toughness and very solid skills .
Unfortunately , due to his age , he ’s not considered very valuable for most organizations .
He ’s an excellent goalie to have in the locker room and could easily be a backup on just about any NHL team .
But because the focus for teams is on young goalies with extremely high potential , it ’s very unlikely Brodeur ever becomes anything more than an NHL backup .
That being said , anything can happen .
If you wanted to relate him to another goalie that has thrived in the twilight of his pro career , just look at Scott Clemmensen .
He was a backup his whole life until Martin Brodeur went down with the torn biceps injury .
The rest was history and Clemmensen was able to extend his career for a few more years down in Florida .
There ’s no reason Mike Brodeur ca n’t do the same thing .
At least now the organization has confidence in him and will not hesitate to throw him in the crease if the situation arises .
And I ’m more than confident he would be very successful as well .
Your website lists Robin Lehner as the 9th best goalie prospect in your Top - 100 Prospects list .
Could you expand on Lehner 's qualities as a goalie ?
Also , what do you predict for his future ?
Is he ready for the AHL next year ?
Do you feel he has it in him to be a starting goaltender someday at the NHL level ?
How long until he would be ready for the NHL ?
Just to clarify , my Top - 100 Prospects Rankings is for fantasy keeper leagues and a feature aimed at my School of Block fantasy hockey articles , not straight up talent or potential , so the ranking should be taken from a long - term perspective .
That being said , Lehner is still one of the better highly - touted European goalies out there and has the potential to be an elite # 1 goalie in the NHL .
A mini-scouting report on Lehner would read like this :
Lehner is one of the best goalies in his age group when it comes to matching quickness with size .
He has a daunting presence in the net that fills up more holes than most goalies , especially when he ’s confident and at the top of his crease .
His butterfly is a little bit wider than average , so he will need to work on straightening his back and having better balance and stronger net coverage and lateral movement while on his knees .
Similar to other raw European goalies , his stance needs to be refined over the course of a few more seasons and his energy and excitement in the crease needs to be channeled more effectively .
But for his size , he ’s very quick and has good active hands , which take away the corners and covers holes on the ice effectively .
You can tell he has received a lot of elite , structured coaching from his father , Michael Lehner , as it shows in Robin ’s technique and overall execution .
Michael is Henrik Lundqvist ’s former goalie coach , so Robin has been highly influenced by both of them .
Since this is his first season playing in North America , you can expect two more seasons in the OHL before turning pro and heading to the AHL .
Other doors could open and things could happen sooner but I think you ’re looking at three more years before he ’s NHL ready .
He has the potential to not only be a # 1 goalie in the NHL , but be an elite long - term keeper .
How does the Senators ' goaltending depth compare to other NHL teams ?
I would say it ’s one of the weaker depth charts in the NHL .
If you check the Senators ’ website , they have zero goalies listed under their prospects page and I ’m wondering if that ’s a mistake or proof they need some goalies in the system .
Lehner is certainly a prized prospect that has only scratched the surface of his potential , but other than Elliott and maybe Chris Holt , there ’s not much to get excited about .
Brodeur is too old to be considered a prospect and Andy Chiodo has bounced all over the place in the last few seasons .
In fact , he was just sent down to Elmira in the ECHL , so it looks more and more like Holt is sticking in Binghamton .
It would serve the Senators well to draft or acquire some prospects this summer .
Finally , if you 're Bryan Murray , what round do you grab a goaltender in this year 's draft , if at all ?
I would take 2 - 3 goalies in different rounds depending on what ’s available and be sure to draft at least one European talent from Finland or Sweden .
There has been a growing trend of European goalies being drafted and promptly placed into the CHL , where many of them seem to thrive and blossom much more than originally expected .
Two goalies will probably be drafted in the first round this summer – Jack Campbell and Calvin Pickard .
There are more quality eligible goalies out there , but I would take one named Jussi Rynnas in 4th or 5th round .
He ’s put together a surprising season for a very weak team ( Assat ) and has turned heads in a hurry , very similar to what Jonas Gustavsson did last season with Farjestad .
We 'd like to extend a huge thank you to Justin for donating his time to do this .
We really , really appreciate it , and encourage you to check out the Goalie Guild site or their Twitter feed for the best goaltending coverage on the web .

This morning the New York Times carries as its lead story something with this headline : States ’ Rights Is Rallying Cry of Resistance for Lawmakers .
And the article is replete with examples of state lawmakers passing measures that would , in theory , limit the reach of the federal government .
So , just to repeat the examples that The Times leads with ( having done our work for us already ) :
Gov. Mike Rounds of South Dakota , a Republican , signed a bill into law on Friday declaring that the federal regulation of firearms is invalid if a weapon is made and used in South Dakota .
On Thursday , Wyoming ’s governor , Dave Freudenthal , a Democrat , signed a similar bill for that state .
The same day , Oklahoma ’s House of Representatives approved a resolution that Oklahomans should be able to vote on a state constitutional amendment allowing them to opt out of the federal health care overhaul .
In Utah , lawmakers embraced states ’ rights with a vengeance in the final days of the legislative session last week .
One measure said Congress and the federal government could not carry out health care reform , not in Utah anyway , without approval of the Legislature .
Another bill declared state authority to take federal lands under the eminent domain process .
A resolution asserted the “ inviolable sovereignty of the State of Utah under the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution . ”
The Times article points out that legal and constitutional scholars are pretty much of the view that this is mostly a bunch of hot air .
But that does n’t seem to be deterring state lawmakers from shouting a lot .
It turns out there ’s something called The Patrick Henry caucus in the Utah legislature which , according to The Times , “ formed last year and led the assault on federal legal barricades in the session that ended Thursday . ”
There ’s also something called The Tenth Amendment Center , which prides itself on pushing this sort of thing , as if Article 6 of the Constitution did n’t exist .
It ’s worth a quick look just to see how bizarrely some of this stuff can be dressed up .
We ’ve been here before , of course , as we noted in our comment on the secessionists last summer .
And , once again , it ’s useful to drag out that interesting data from The Tax Foundation on which states are Givers and which states are Takers .
Givers , remember , are states whose federal tax payments exceed money received back from the federal government ;
Takers are states who get back more in federal taxes than they pay .
This is actually a useful way to look at the world , because , as is often the case , when you follow the money ( or lack of it ) , a different story emerges .
We might think of giver states as , say , Parents , and taker states as , say , Deadbeat Offspring .
All sorts of potentially colourful labels emerge , but we ’ll leave it at that .
Because , once again , you have to wonder if anyone knows anything anymore .
Let ’s take that Patrick Henry group in Utah , who probably think they ’re choosing between Liberty or Death .
If we check the good old Tax Foundation data for 2005 ( the most recent year for which they present data ) , it turns out that Utah is — yes !— a taker , getting back $ 1.07 in federal spending for every $ 1 in federal taxes paid .
So , Utah — a deadbeat state .
South Dakota–ditto .
South Dakota gets back a whopping $ 1.53 for every $ 1 paid in federal taxes .
That ’s pretty impressive .
Wyoming ?
Check — it gets back $ 1.11 for every $ 1 paid .
Oklahoma — a state with lots of oil ?
Hey , look , Oklahoma gets back $ 1.36 for every $ 1 paid .
Most of this , according to The Times , is driven by conservative ideology :
“ There ’s a tsunami of interest in states ’ rights and resistance to an overbearing federal government ; that ’s what all these measures indicate , ” said Gary Marbut , the president of the Montana Shooting Sports Association , which led the drive last year for one of the first “ firearms freedoms , ” laws like the ones signed last week in South Dakota and Wyoming .
In most cases , conservative anxiety over federal authority is fueling the impulse , with the Tea Party movement or its members in the backdrop or forefront .
Mr. Herrod in Utah said that he had spoken at Tea Party rallies , for example , but that his efforts , and those of the Patrick Henry Caucus , were not directly connected to the Tea Partiers .
But not all :
And in some cases , according to the Tenth Amendment Center , the politics of states ’ rights are veering left .
Rhode Island , Vermont and Wisconsin , for example — none of them known as conservative bastions — are considering bills that would authorize , or require , governors to recall or take control of National Guard troops , asserting that federal calls to active duty have exceeded federal authority .
Actually , this is potentially interesting — Vermont is a taker ( $ 1.08 ) , but Wisconsin is one of the 17 ( yes , only 17 ) giver sates ( at $ 0.86 ) , and Rhode Island gets back exactly as much as it pays out .
And Montana ?
Right , Montana gets back $ 1.47 for every buck it gives to the dreaded and overbearing federal government .
Really , the solution to this is pretty simple .
Just pass a Constitutional Amendment that would prohibit states from receiving more in federal disbursements than it pays in federal taxes .
If residents of Montana and Utah and the Old South ( where secession talk has been cropping up more frequently ) want to moan about the overbearance of the federal government , they should man up and agree not to take any more money from the federal government than they pay in .
Gee , I wonder how that will turn out .
Otherwise , let ’s just laugh at them for being the hypocritical deadbeats that they are , and if we live in a Giver state , start leaning on our representatives about why we continue to subsidize these states whose legislatures clearly do n’t appreciate it .
Like us , you probably spent most of this past NFL playoff weekend wondering when the actual NFL playoffs would commence .
Seriously , fellas :
If we wanted to see that much painfully uneventful action , we'd have stuck to the Golden Globes .
Thank goodness for the New York Jets , who sympathize with our tragic addiction to drama , and obliged with a rousing 17 - 14 victory over San Diego that will steer the Chargers headlong into a winter of intense Jungian analysis .
The better news is that we enter the coming NFL conference - championship ...
This is n’t funny .
We have a serious problem in this country , and any sane Republicans who are left had better get a hold of their party .
Hard to read these results and not think “ Timothy McVeigh . ”
Per the latest Harris poll , the number of Republicans who think Obama …
– Is a socialist ( 67 % )
– Wants to take away Americans ’ right to own guns ( 61 % )
– Is a Muslim ( 57 % )
– Wants to turn over the sovereignty of the United States to a one world government ( 51 % ) ; and
– Has done many things that are unconstitutional ( 55 % ) .
– Resents America ’s heritage ( 47 % )
– Was not born in the United States and so is not eligible to be president ( 45 % )
– Is the “ domestic enemy that the U.S. Constitution speaks of ” ( 45 % )
– Is a racist ( 42 % )
– Want to use an economic collapse or terrorist attack as an excuse to take dictatorial powers ( 41 % )
– Is doing many of the things that Hitler did ( 38 % ) .
– Even more remarkable perhaps , fully 24 % of Republicans believe that “ he may be the Anti-Christ ” and 22 % believe “ he wants the terrorists to win . ”
The results are from the first week of March .

If a man really wants to make a million dollars , the best way would be to start his own religion .
-- Lafayette Ronald Hubbard ( AKA L. Ron Hubbard )
It can be comforting to have simple answers to complex problems .
Like attributing stress and mental illness to alien parasites placed in human bodies by a galactic overlord who existed before the universe even existed .
Here are easy steps to overcome problems and attain enlightenment :
First , visit one of our offices for an evaluation where we can gather your personal information and undermine your confidence .
We will convince you , as fresh raw meat to Scifiology , that your life is in ruins , and that you must disconnect yourself from family and friends who might convince you otherwise .
This works best if you 're already vulnerable with low self - esteem .
After you come to realize what a broken , diminished and humiliated wretch you are , Scifiology will get you back in control after you sign contracts and waivers .
Give your committment and money to the church .
Do n't worry about this life here and now ; just think how much better off you 'll be in the future by rejecting reality .
You will also be rewarded by leveling up , like in a video game .
The fewer thetans ( alien parasites ) that you still have in your body , the higher your score .
Never mind that it's a completely subjective claim made by us as to how many thetans you harbor .
Keep paying for cleansing , auditing , counseling , books , courses and other services and materials .
Take out loans if you can , as debt is meaningless compared to the triumph of your future .
If you decide to leave Scifiology , members will be required to sever all contact from you , even close family and friends .
Good luck surviving outside the embrace of Scifiology .
ISTANBUL — A U.S. congressional vote on how to define the 1915 slaughter of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire , expected Thursday , is turning into a game of brinksmanship between the White House and Ankara .
In previous years , Congress has attempted to pass a resolution to recognize the Armenian events as genocide .
Such a resolution would inflame Turkey and has brought vows from past U.S. administrations that they would block the bill , a nod to Turkey 's role as a key ally of Washington in the Middle East .
This ...
There 's no doubt , people love their pets .
However , there are many animals that are neglected for various reasons .
One big reason being ignorance .
Rabbits and baby chicks for Easter .
Really ?
I 'm doubt Jesus was thinking about furry bunnies and baby chickens while he was on the cross .
Fortunatley though , there are MANY folks who love and appreciate animals .
They know the challenges and results that are inherent with domesticating animals for profit .
They dedicate their lives to rescuing them , and by doing so , demonstrate that they are true guardians for the humane treatment of animals .
One organization , Animal Friends has a detailed list of organizations that exist to help people help animals in need .
Animal Friends is based in Pittsburgh , PA so some of the resources are local to that area , however there are many more that are national .
I think the list is helpful for anyone who has a interest in helping animals .
When you consider how close the world is becoming with Facebook and Twitter , you never know when a status update or a tweet comes along where someone is trying to help a friend whether it be a human , animal or both .
By bookmarking this resource page , you have a handy reference to pass along to help .
And the photo on this page is so adorable , it will bring a smile to your face .
Paying it forward comes in many currencies , and this resource is a an example of that .

Sunday Old School : AC / DC and Remembering Bon Scott 30 Years Later
Close your eyes and think of AC / DC .
If you 're like most people , the first thing that enters your mind is the image of Angus Young in his schoolboy suit doing his Chuck Berry on speed duckwalk across the stage .
The second thing for most is the image of singer Brian Johnson , cap pulled down nearly to his eyes , letting loose with a powerdrill wail .
For 30 years , that 's been the case — but it was n't always so .
There was a time when AC / DC 's vocalist was every bit as outrageous and unpredictable as its pint - sized guitar god .
With a boozy strut , and a wicked glint in his eye that bespoke propensities for violence when provoked and sex whenever ( and wherever ) , Bon Scott commanded the stage in ways that only a few frontmen — Jagger , Plant and ( just maybe ) David Lee Roth — could match .
Scott is often spoken of as being “ AC / DC 's first singer , ” but that 's not the case .
The band 's first vocalist was Dave Evans , a much more glam - inspired singer .
Of course , the band during Evans ' tenure behind the microphone was a much more glam - inspired bunch , as the video clip for the first single “ Can I Sit Next To You Girl ” below shows ( and dig Angus and Malcolm Young trading licks in a way you do n't normally see in this band ) .
But Angus Young and Evans did n't get along , and the band was looking for a new , rawer singer .
They did n't have to look far .
At the time , Bon Scott was working for the band as its driver .
Before that , though , Scott had been well - known in Australia as one of two lead vocalists in the bubblegum pop band the Valentines , and as the singer of the hippy - dippy outfit Fraternity ( dig that recorder ) .
Several accounts point to Scott being much more interested in singing hard rock in the bars after the gigs than he was in performing either of these types of music .
That , of course , made AC / DC the perfect fit for him .
And if you thought Angus Young 's schoolboy outfit was outrageous , check out Bon 's schoolGIRL outfit in this early television appearance , in which the band plays its cover of “ Baby Please Don't Go . ”
Scott 's first two albums with AC / DC , “ High Voltage ” and , especially “ TNT ” still form a big chunk of the modern AC / DC setlist .
Tunes like “ The Jack ” allowed Bon to show off his talent for clever wordplay and his ability to quickly learn new instruments ( he was also a fairly adept guitarist and an excellent drummer ) came in handy on the bagpipe - enhanced “ It 's a Long Way to the Top ( If You Wanna Rock ' N Roll ) . ”
Next up was 1976's “ Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap , ” which emphasized boogie over blazing guitar work on tracks like “ There 's Gonna Be Some Rockin ' . ”
The title track is a classic , but for me , the heart of the album is the slower , surprisingly introspective “ Ride On , ” which hints at the loneliness of life on the road .
“ Let There Be Rock , ” the band 's 1977 classic album is , as Angus Young put it , “ a fucking great guitar album . ”
It 's the other Scott album that has taken up big chunks of the band 's setlist to the present day , with songs like the title track and Scott 's ode to a large Tasmanian woman he had the pleasure of knowing , “ Whole Lotta Rosie . ”
With such blazing fretwork , it 's small wonder that Angus ' guitar amp once caught fire during the recording sessions .
The next year came “ Powerage , ” which is arguably the most underrated album of the Scott era , despite having fans that included Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones .
It 's a surprisingly dark affair , with “ What 's Next to the Moon ? ” having not - so - veiled threats of murder against the object of the singer 's affections .
“ Riff Raff ” and “ Sin City ” both have gotten a fair amount of play on stage , and , more recently , the band resurrected “ Rock ' n ' Roll Damnation ” on the “ Live at the Circus Krone ” DVD .
The chief criticism of the album was that it seemed to be too much a continuation of “ Let There Be Rock . ”
I say , what 's wrong with that ?
After 1978 's live “ If You Want Blood , You 've Got It ” came the high point , in terms of sales and recognition , of Scott 's tenure with the band , 1979 's “ Highway to Hell . ”
The title track was n't — as some would later claim — an ode to Satan , but rather a colorful description of life on the road , which had its origins in a quote from Angus Young to a reporter .
“ Shot Down in Flames ” and “ Girls Got Rhythm ” have stayed in the AC / DC setlist , off and on , as has “ Highway to Hell . ”
And then , in 1980 , it ended all too soon .
Scott died of acute alcohol poisoning in a friend 's car 30 years ago this week .
The band soldiered on with Brian Johnson taking his place on “ Back In Black , ” some of which had been written before Scott 's passing .
There exist demo recordings of a couple tracks ( most notably “ Have a Drink on Me ” ) with Scott on drums , but , to my knowledge , they 've never been released even in bootleg form .
The band has paid tribute to Scott several times over the years , releasing the “ ' 74 Jailbreak ” EP in 1984 with some previously Australian - only releases , and the expansive “ Bonfire ” box set in 1997 , which included studio rarities , the soundtrack to the “ Let There Be Rock ” concert film and more .
Last year , the band put out “ Backtracks , ” a box set that essentially cleared the decks of all the rest of the B - sides and Aussie - only tracks that had built up over the years .
It 's well worth buying for tracks like “ Stick Around ” and the itchy ode to body lice , “ Crabsody In Blue . ”
But be prepared to shiver a little when Scott eerily foretells his own death in “ Carry Me Home . ”
So , let 's raise our glass to one of rock 's greatest .
“ Let There Be Rock , ” shouted Bon Scott , and there was .
And it was much more than good .

Verbal interviews may be the only or last platform where you can sell your attributes to the prospective employer and make the best first impression that will land you that dream job .
Interviews are nerve - wracking and may sometimes be the final nail in the coffin , making you miss the grand opportunity of getting a job .
Sometimes luck and the right connections can play a part in landing that dream opportunity , but if these two do n’t feature in your quest to land a job , then perhaps you need to have these five tips to ace that interview ;
1 . Once you get that call to appear before the interviewer , begin carrying out a simple research on the company .
The internet is a resourceful well of information and many corporations own websites nowadays , making it easy to get basic information on the enterprise .
This will benefit you in getting to know what the company advocates for , give you an idea on the perks available , and give you an advantage of being knowledgeable and not be caught flat - footed .
2. Being confident starts by proper preparation .
Apart from carrying out research on the firm , finding the perfect attire for the interview is key .
Laying it out before the said day will alert you of any missing buttons or stains and save you time on the D - day , allowing you to be punctual .
Avoid too much makeup and accessories as this may be off - putting and give a false perception of your character , especially if the job pertains to the corporate world .
3 . Punctuality will come in handy because you get enough time to ease into the mood and prepare yourself psychologically while being in the actual interview environment .
It also gives your future employer the impression that you value and respect .
4 . Carry with you a copy of your resume and testimonials , alongside any other documents that you think you may require .
Trust me ; the extra load may just earn you points with the interview panel , showing that you always prepare for any outcomes .
5 . Once inside the interview room , break the ice by greeting the panel and ask if you can be seated .
Maintain eye contact with the person asking the questions .
When asked a question that you may not have a ready answer for , try to have them ask it again to buy a few seconds to search your brain .
Stay calm , remain conscious of the panel , stay true to yourself and try to be as honest as possible in your responses .
Always highlight your strengths and try as much as possible to avoid any negative responses that begin with “ I do n’t ” and badmouthing your previous employer .
If given a chance to ask a question but you have none , ask how soon you can expect any feedback on if you made it through or not .
With these few tips , please try to maintain a positive attitude , thank the interviewers for the opportunity and time , and always smile .
Keep in mind that the interviewers may have once in their lives , been in your position and may understand if you have the occasional stammer due to nerves .
Above all , try to remember to sit up straight , switch off your phone and stay relaxed and keep in mind that failing one interview may be the practice you need that will lead to your passing the next one .
With legislation encompassing almost 3,000 pages , it will take time to find out exactly what the mandates in the newly passed health care law mean for America .
After all , it was n’t until the end of last week that the reconciliation bill was even made public .
But here 's something we already have uncovered .
And it 's shocking .
--
In addition to all the special favors doled out to various congressional districts , it turns out that the congressional staff who wrote the health care bill put in special favors for themselves , too .
While everyone else in the United States -- from the top corporate executives to the grocery store checkout clerk -- will be forced to buy their insurance through heavily regulated state - run exchanges , the health care bill excludes one group : the leadership and committee staff .
Yes , that ’s right .
The very people who wrote up this bill are refusing to be included themselves .
Given the narrow definition of “ congressional staff ” on page 158 of the health care bill , the Congressional Research Service memo believes that courts will not require “ professional committee staff , joint committee staff , some shared staff , as well as potentially those staff employed by leadership offices ” to go through the exchanges .
President Obama and his family are also exempt from the law .
Insurance plans will only be allowed in these exchanges if they meet rules governing benefit packages , quality standards and measures of uniformity of enrollment procedures .
And it does n't stop there they must also meet the rules about provider networks , the right kind of rating system , outreach , reinsurance and risk adjustment , and a variety of other federally determined processes .
If these regulations are so wonderful , Americans have a simple question : what is it that Democrats know about the state - run insurance exchanges that make them want to avoid them ?
The answer seems obvious .
These regulations will raise costs , not lower them as the president promised , and lower the quality of medicine that policyholders receive .
Jim Manley , Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid 's spokesman tried to put the best spin on this by telling Politico that they did n’t want language that would have required “ people like legislative counsel , Architect of the Capitol , etc. ” to be included in the exchanges .
Though he made it sound like this was a matter of technical language , there remains the fundamental question of why anyone , especially somebody putting together and advocating this very bill , should be exempt in the first place .
These public servants must to be governed by the same rules that the rest of us mere mortals have to obey .
Democrats have no obvious explanation about why this provision was quietly inserted into the health care bill .
Senator Tom Coburn ( R - Okla . ) warned that he and other Republican Senators tried to fix the problem of staff being excluded from the rules .
“ I tried to fix this inequity along with senators Grassley , Burr and Vitter , but Majority Leader [ Harry ] Reid obstructed our effort , ” Senator Coburn said .
Obviously , the Democratic leadership knew full well that the bill they passed on Sunday with such fanfare is going to make things worse for the vast majority of those who are already insured .
There is no other reason why the staff that wrote this bill would exempt themselves .
The anger over the Democrats ’ hypocrisy should be deafening .

Narus is developing a new technology that sleuths through billions of pieces of data on social networks and Internet services and connects the dots .
The new program , code - named Hone , is designed to give intelligence and law enforcement agencies a leg up on criminals who are now operating anonymously on the Internet .
In many ways , the cyber world is ideal for subversive and terrorist activities , said Antonio Nucci , chief technology officer with Narus .
" For bad people , it 's an easy place to hide , " Nucci said .
" They can get lost and very easily hide behind a massive ocean of legal digital transactions . "
It 's trivial to set up a Gmail or Facebook account under a fake name .
The question for law enforcement then becomes , how does it connect different pieces of information to the same person ?
" It 's very hard to connect these two pieces of information , " Nucci said .
" We 're really asking [ law enforcement ] to become almost like magicians . "
Narus is best known as the creator of NarusInsight , an network monitoring device that can analyze traffic on IP networks .
AT&T allegedly used a Narus system to wiretap customer data on behalf of the U.S. National Security Agency as part of a U.S. domestic terrorist surveillance program .
Hone works in tandem with NarusInsight .
By Nucci's own admission , however , it can do some pretty " scary " things .
The software 's user creates a target profile , and Hone then proceeds to link what Nucci calls " islands of information . "
Hone can analyze VOIP conversations , biometrically identify someone 's voice or photograph and then associate it with different phone numbers .
" I can have a sample of your voice in English , and you can start speaking Mandarin tomorrow .
It does n't matter ; I 'm going to catch you . "
It uses artificial intelligence to analyze e-mails and can link mails to different accounts , doing what Nucci calls topical analysis .
" It 's going to go through a set of documents and automatically it 's going to organize them in topics -- I 'm not talking about keywords as is done today , I 'm talking about topics , " he said .
That can't be done with today 's technology , he said .
" If you search for fertilizers on Google ... it 's going to come back with 6.5 million pages .
Enjoy , " he said .
" If you want to search for non-farmers who are discussing fertilizer ... it 's not even searchable . "
Hone will sift through millions of profiles searching for people with similar attributes -- blogger profiles that share the same e-mail address , for example .
It can look for statistically likely matches , by studying things like the gender , nationality , age , location , home and work addresses of people .
Another component can trace the location of someone using a mobile device such as a laptop or phone .
Bit by bit , it pieces together the subject 's different identities on the Internet .
Narus is still testing the waters with Hone .
Working with a consortium of universities , the company has used Hone to sift through massive amounts of public information .
" We started to collect data three years ago and we 've gone through several programs , " Nucci said .
" We have something like 75 million users in our system . "
With the permission of users , Nucci 's team also analyzed data on about 50,000 private profiles .
Nucci will discuss Hone at the RSA Conference in San Francisco Friday .
The company is now talking to potential customers such as defense contractors and government agencies to see if there 's enough interest to turn Hone into a product .
" If the market is as big as we guess it 's going to be , then we will start rolling this into products , " Nucci said .
That day could be just a year away , he added .

We recently looked at CDS spreads to determine which sovereigns investors are the most concerned about .
But that 's a crude , highly - inexact approach considering the illiquid and generally esoteric nature of the sovereign CDS market .
Credit Suisse has come up with its own list of the riskiest countries using such measures as credit rating , CDS spreads , potential for GDP growth , government debt , private sector credit , and the budget balance .
Those factors are all compiled into a single score and then ranked .
And unlike with the previous list , the US is on it .
Unlucky in love ?
Fret not – vajazzle your va-jay - jay and all will be well with the world .
What do you mean , you do n't know what that means ?
It 's all the rage in celebrity land
My favourite ­celebrity fact used to be that Elizabeth Hurley classified six ­raisins as a ­l­egi­timate snack .
( My delight was ­further burnished when at around the same time she also let slip that They refer to Us as " civilians " .
­Welcome to LaLa Land , where ­wearing Versace to premieres ­evidently counts as military service . )
Then it was the fact that Simon Cowell has black toilet paper in all his loos .
And I thought my current favourite would never be bettered , which is that Hugh Laurie and Jay Leno are the proud owners of the Burger King gold card , entitling them to – and you may want to hold on to your civilian hats for this one , folks – free hamburgers and fries for life !
Looking down on that golden rectangle , they must have wept like Alexander , for there were no more worlds left to conquer .
But this week there came a ­reve­lation from actor Jennifer Love Hewitt that – both metaphorically and , now that I think about it , ­literally – unveiled a brand new and unsuspected vista of uncharted territory .
I shall quote the lady in full , as to paraphrase would be to lose too much in a world already running low on exuberance .
" After I broke up with my ­boyfriend , " said the star of Ghost Whisperer , I Know What You Did Last Summer and ... um ...
I Still Know What You Did Last Summer , " a friend Swarovski - crystalled my ­precious lady and it shone like a disco ball .
Women should vajazzle their va-jay - jays ! "
There are a few times in one 's life when one has to take a moment to recalibrate one 's entire world view .
I think this is one of them .
­Questions need to be asked and ­answered ­before we can hope to move on with our lives .
Namely :
1 ) Has an actor who is clearly as mad as a box of frogs nevertheless ­inadvertently stumbled across the world 's first truly feminist break - up ritual ?
What could be more ­cheering than to decorate your ­precious lady so prettily and yet more empowering than furnishing it with a serrated edge at the same time ?
Please do not send ­answers on a postcard .
Please .
2 ) How soon would the beauty of the result be countermanded by the resultant chafing ?
Perhaps , like super - high heels , it is something only celebrities who walk no farther than a red carpet 's length can sport .
Civilians who have to walk to bus stops and around supermarkets and stuff might have to settle for a ­sequined version .
3 ) Is " vajazzle your va-jay - jay " , in fact , tautologous ?
Does one not ­simply " vajazzle " ?
To whom should we apply for adjudication on this ?
And if the decision comes down on the side of tautology , can we appeal on the grounds that " vajazzle your va- jay - jay " is quite the most joyous - sounding phrase ever to have been uttered and that just occasionally grammar should be forced to cede to pleasure ?
4 ) What is the makers of Swarovski crystals ' current take on the adage that " all publicity is good publicity " ?
5 ) Where can I get a friend like that ?
Do you know what my friends have done for me this week ?
One invited me to " come round and help me eat up this casserole because it 's starting to make the fridge smell " .
One made me watch her try on clothes in a shop until I started to bleed from the ears with boredom .
And another made me go out , in the cold , in the rain , to the theatre .
To see a play .
And a quick straw poll by email ­suggests that , of those whose ­firewalls let through the request , there is n't one of them who would even contemplate gumming a single gold star on me anywhere below the lapel line , let alone festoon my nether regions with the necessary .
There 's nothing else for it .
I ­cannot live like this – so dull !
So unglitteringly unglamorous !
– any more .
I 'm going to have to get ­famous or , at the very least , get some new friends .
The Archbishop of Vienna today said priestly celibacy could be one of the causes of the sex abuse scandals to hit the Catholic church .
In an article for Thema Kirche , his diocesan magazine , Christoph Schonborn became the most senior figure in the Catholic hierarchy to make the connection between the two and called for an " unflinching examination " of the possible reasons for paedophilia .
He wrote : " These include the issue of priest training , as well as the question of what happened in the so - called sexual revolution .
" It also includes the issue of priest celibacy and the issue of personality development .
It requires a great deal of honesty , both on the part of the church and of society as a whole . "
Schonborn is not the first person to suggest a link between celibacy and paedophilia – the theologian Hans Kung has made the same assertion .
A spokesman clarified the archbishop 's words , insisting he was " in no way " seeking to question the celibacy rule or call for its abolition .
Schonborn 's remarks followed further revelations of abuse across Europe , with new incidents coming to light in Austria , Germany and the Netherlands , and followed claims by an Italian academic that a greater presence of women in the Vatican could have prevented clerical sexual abuse from taking place .
Writing in L'Osservatore Romano , Lucetta Scaraffia said women might have helped remove the " veil of secrecy " surrounding the abuse .
She used the word " omerta " – the Mafia code of silence – to describe the conspiracy involved in hiding the offences .
" We can hypothesise that a greater female presence , not at a subordinate level , would have been able to rip the veil of masculine secrecy that in the past often covered the denunciation of these misdeeds with silence , " she said .
" Women , in fact , both religious and lay , by nature would have been more likely to defend young people in cases of sexual abuse , allowing the church to avoid the grave damage brought by these sinful acts . "
In an attempt to contain the fallout from abuse cases , Vatican officials expressed concern that the church 's insistence on confidentiality in its treatment of priestly sexual abuse cases was seen as a ban on reporting serious accusations to the civil authorities .
Earlier this year , Cardinal Claudio Hummes , the head of the Congregation for Clergy group , said instances of sexual abuse by priests were " criminal facts " as well as serious sins , and required co-operation with the civil justice system .
The Tax Foundation has published Can Income Tax Hikes Close the Deficit ? :
Using the Tax Foundation 's Microsimulation Model to analyze the deficits projected by the President 's Budget , we can project how much revenue a broad - based increase in federal income tax rates would generate .
As usual , the President 's Budget forecasts lower deficits than any other reputable source , but we have used those optimistic deficit estimates to show that even the rosiest deficit scenario is far from rosy .
Assuming deductions , exemptions and credits were kept the same as they are now , Congress would have to raise each personal income tax rate by a factor of almost two and a half to erase the 2010 deficit .
Even in later years when the President 's Budget predicts that the deficit will be " only " in the $ 700 - to - $ 800 billion range , the rates necessary to close the deficit are untenable .
Table 1 shows the effect on statutory rates of such a hypothetical tax hike in 2010 .
Instead of taxing couples with rates that range from 10 percent to 35 percent , tax rates would have to start at 24.3 percent and range up to 84.9 percent .
Table 2 applies the same method as Table 1 but for the years 2011 through 2020 .
Two rate increases for this 10 - year period are already counted in the deficit projections given by the President 's Budget .
The top two tax rates will increase on January 1 , 2011 .
The 33 % rate will rise to 36 % , and the 35 % rate will rise to 39.6 % .
Yet the additional tax rate hikes necessary beyond those , and for all the lower brackets , are still remarkably steep if the budget deficit is to be eliminated , especially at the end of the decade when , even with optimistic deficit projections , deficits are expected to rise quickly and hit $ 1 trillion .
Table 2 applies the same method as Table 1 but for the years 2011 through 2020 .
Two rate increases for this 10 - year period are already counted in the deficit projections given by the President 's Budget .

Yet the additional tax rate hikes necessary beyond those , and for all the lower brackets , are still remarkably steep if the budget deficit is to be eliminated , especially at the end of the decade when , even with optimistic deficit projections , deficits are expected to rise quickly and hit $ 1 trillion .

Responding to growing evidence that people who abuse animals often go on to attack humans , states are increasing the penalties for animal cruelty and developing better methods for tracking convicted offenders .
State lawmakers are paying especially close attention to animal hoarders — people who keep large numbers of pets without providing for their most basic needs — because these offenders are prone to recidivism and can cost counties huge sums for cleanup costs and the care of rescued animals .
At least 27 states now allow courts to bar convicted animal abusers from owning or coming into contact with pets , nearly double the number from a decade ago , and 3 other states are considering similar measures this year .
Tennessee and California are considering bills to create online registries of animal abusers .
“ It ’s not that animal abuse is more prevalent , ” said Stephan Otto , director of legislative affairs with the Animal Legal Defense Fund .
“ What has changed over the past few years is the recognition that animal abuse is often a warning sign for other types of violence and neglect . ”

Hulu 's sales team is " actively subverting " the ad sales of its parent companies that are also trying to sell ads for their shows on Hulu , according to a source at one of the parent companies .
According to our source , Hulu 's ad sales team is " cutting rates , " so its ad prices are cheaper .
Hulu is also building different , more innovative , ad products than its parent companies like FOX , NBC , and ABC .
Basically , Hulu is selling better ads at cheaper rates .
It 's " hollowing out ad sales " for the networks .
The bigger companies are finding it harder to sell Hulu ads at higher rates .
This news is significant because Hulu needs the long - term support of its parent companies to survive .
If Hulu were to lose its exclusive access to FOX , NBC , and ABC TV shows , the whole operation would fall apart .
Another executive familiar with Hulu 's business said it 's not fair to compare what ads Hulu sells to what its parents sell .
By contract , Hulu is n't allowed to sell ads for a specific television show .
It can only sell to demographics or genres .
Meanwhile , the networks are selling their shows , so they can demand a premium .
This source says , " By design , the networks should be able to charge a higher CPM at the outset because they can bundle and sell the premium brands . "
In other words , Hulu 's innovative ad designs are n't meant to undercut the networks .
They 're the only advantage Hulu has over the networks for selling ads .
But the bottom line is , two years after it launched , Hulu and its network parents are still trying to figure out their awkward relationship -- one that we have long believed will doom the company to failure .
We asked our first source if it was a matter of the left hand not knowing what the right hand is doing .
His reply , " The left hand is trying to chop off the right hand . "
We reached out to Hulu , but the company refused to comment .

Serf Farming
In another example of the retail giant ’s eagerness to profit from government , Walmart has teamed up with schools in Michigan to train inner-city youths to work at suburban Walmart stores .
Detroit Free Press states that “ Students will get 11 weeks of job - readiness training during the school day and 10 high school credits for the class and work experience . ”
Presumably they would get paid for eleven weeks of retail “ training , ” but that is n’t mentioned in the news reports .
Walmart , wielding tremendous economic power , is an integral part of the state - capitalist system which exists to control people and the resources they produce .
When leaders talk of “ stability ” they do not mean that everyone will have a stable basis to pursue their dreams with as little disruption as possible .
Their idea of stability is when power structures are firmly rooted and hard to topple .
The divide between public and private power is often blurry where it exists at all .
The school system is well - suited to produce serfs for capitalists – particularly in places where local economic conditions stifle outside opportunities .
Students are forced into a classroom separated from the rest of the world where they will be taught to satisfy the demands of authority and see the world through the lenses that authority provides .
The state is a primary enabler of Walmart ’s predatory activity .
The state destroys neighborhoods in the name of redevelopment , wages war on them in the name of drug prohibition , cripples businesses in the name of safety , and meddles in all areas of life in the name of paternalism .
Because that ’s the rules .
The state attacks people who try to live autonomously and trains them from a young age to follow the rules and defer to their betters .
The state is the bandit who steals a peasant ’s food , and Walmart is the other gangster who shows up to offer the peasant supplies for a hefty sum , but never intends to help end the cycle of robbery and exploitation .
Some agencies block opportunities for the non-connected , which forms opportunities for those entrenched in power to act as benefactor .
So what should be taught instead of servitude ?
The independence of finding one ’s own way in life and the entrepreneurial skills to make it work .
This would include finding ways around the obstacles that government puts in the way .
Building solidarity with others seeking an end to domination , and creating mutual aid networks can benefit the individuals involved .
A serious undertaking would be creating alternatives to institutionalized schooling , as discussed in the Alliance of the Libertarian Left pamphlet Liberating Learning . *
A Walmart lesson can teach students what is expected of them and what it means to put time and effort into an organization that does n’t care about you as an individual ( a poor choice to make if there are other options ) .
Entrepreneurial Walmart students might learn about individual reclamation .
When a person takes resources that have been monopolized by the collusion of social , economic , and political power , he is benefitting at the expense of those who would not hesitate a second to steal from those without power .
But there are safer and less controversial things that could be done – and they will ultimately prove more effective at breaking monopoly .
Worker solidarity ought to be spread inside and outside of the workplace .
The pamphlet How to Fire Your Boss * would probably be useful .
Or prospective serfs could learn things to use against Walmart – from whistle - blowing dirt to product knowledge that would help them compete against Walmart with a non-authoritarian business .
Maximizing profits is n’t just for bosses .
Many people distrust corporate or political power , but look past how they interact with each other .
The efforts of authoritarians to monopolize the future will not be solved by different monopolies or different authorities .
A free world can be made by disassembling monopoly and ending authority .

Ozawa : a rare hint of vulnerability
AS ONE of 15 deputy secretaries - general in the ruling Democratic Party of Japan ( DPJ ) , Yukio Ubukata may often have found it hard to make his voice heard .
Not in the past week .
With his disarmingly unaffected manner , the veteran member of parliament has hit the airwaves denouncing what he calls a dangerous concentration of power and money in the hands of his boss , Ichiro Ozawa .
He knew it was a strategy with a high risk of self - immolation .
Mr Ozawa is the DPJ 's secretary - general .
As the architect of its landslide election victory last August , he is widely regarded as the most powerful politician in Japan .
Even Yukio Hatoyama , the prime minister , yields before him .
What 's more , Mr Ubukata complains , Mr Ozawa controls all the DPJ 's funds and allocates them to his most loyal supporters .
He selects which candidates the party will endorse to run for it during elections .
Such influence makes it very hard for fellow party members to lend public support to any revolt against him .
“ Ozawa - san 's way of handling politics is to give money only to people who share his opinion .
That is what is distorting democracy within the party .
Because of that , no one can stand up to him .
That is the source of his power , ” Mr Ubukata says .
Such incendiary claims could easily be dismissed as the rants of a man with a grudge .
But compellingly , Mr Ubukata has continued to voice them even after Mr Ozawa and Mr Hatoyama personally intervened on March 23rd to stop the party sacking him for his insubordination .
By his account , his brief meeting with Mr Ozawa to secure his future verged on the surreal .
After they had both agreed that he should stay on in his post , Mr Ubukata tried to air his grievances to his boss , notably his concerns about the increasingly authoritarian nature of his leadership .
But , he says , Mr Ozawa left the room abruptly , saying he had no time to discuss such matters .
For policy wonks , the rift has a philosophical aspect , in a country that has only just emerged from half a century of monolithic one - party rule .
Since he first joined the opposition in 1993 , Mr Ozawa has argued for a reformed parliamentary system in Japan , modelled on Britain 's House of Commons .
He believes the government and ruling party should work together under a strong prime minister , with backbenchers kept in line by a party whip .
This , he believes , would end the murky consensus politics that has made decision - making in Japan so hard .
But Mr Ubukata believes such a system is a waste of the many backbenchers among the DPJ 's 423 elected politicians .
He wants them drafted in to help make policy in Japan , rather than sitting idly on the sidelines .
This is what he believes the DPJ stood for when it promised to overhaul a corrupt , decades - old system in which policy was decided by bureaucrats and rubber - stamped by elected officials .
In addition , he wants the party to craft its own policy proposals , rather than waiting for orders from above .
He admits to being disappointed that his one - man crusade did not set off a broader revolt .
The “ seven magistrates ” in the cabinet who are opposed to Mr Ozawa by and large kept their heads down — perhaps betting that Mr Ozawa and Mr Hatoyama will be ousted anyway this summer if the upper - house results are bad .
That is not good enough for Mr Ubukata , who believes Mr Ozawa , embroiled in campaign - finance scandals since last year , should resign well before the upper - house elections , to give the DPJ time to rebuild its credibility .
He may get his way .
The rare hint of vulnerability shown by Mr Ozawa in keeping Mr Ubukata on may be a sign that the end is nearly upon him .

Losing your mother to cancer is a very big thing for any teenager .
Sarah Phillips , 16 , did something different – she made this heart wrenching tribute for her dying mother Debbie who was nearing the end of her four year old battle with cervical cancer .
“ I had this song [ Autumn ] in mind as something that was really appropriate because there is this line that says : ‘ You still live on in my father ’s eyes . ’
Mummy also liked Paulo Nutini ’s music too .
“ In the run-up to mummy ’s death , I thought it was absolutely perfect but it was unrealistic for me to be able to sing it live at her funeral [ because she would be too upset ] , ” said Sarah .
“ So I recorded it on my mobile phone in my bedroom at about 10 pm [ on February 10 ] .
I looked the lyrics up on my computer – it was the first time I had seen them .
“ I had said my ‘ goodbye ’ to mummy the day before .
It was exactly as you would expect .
I said : ‘ I love you . ’
She just said she wanted me to be happy , but she could not speak very much because her breathing was laboured .
“ She was upset by what she would miss – our [ her three children ’s ] weddings , having grandchildren .
She would have been an amazing grandmother . ”
Sarah mentioned the recording to her father three days after her mother ’s death and a family friend , Charlie Mole , a professional score composer and songwriter , helped edit it and put it to music .
The video clips came from 70 hours of family recordings mainly recorded during family holidays abroad .
“ I never appreciated how much mummy suffered because her priority was always to make sure we were not upset by her illness , ” Sarah said .
“ She was incredibly selfless – everything she did was for other people .
I was always very close to my mother and we have always been a close - knit family .
I have wonderful memories of us all together . ”

A new mechanism explaining how tumors escape the body 's natural immune surveillance has recently been discovered at EPFL ( Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne ) in Switzerland .
The study shows how tumors can create a tolerant microenviroment and avoid attack by the immune system by mimicking key features of lymph nodes .
The discovery , published in Science and in Science Express , online March 25 , 2010 , underscores the role of the lymphatic system in cancer and may open up new possibilities for cancer treatment .
" The tumor tricks the body into thinking it is healthy tissue , " says lead author Melody Swartz , head of the Laboratory of Lymphatic and Cancer Bioengineering ( LLCB ) and EPFL professor .
Swartz and her team set out to understand how immune tolerance is induced by tumors , allowing them to progress and spread .
The researchers from EPFL concentrated their efforts on a certain protein that is normally present in healthy lymph nodes to attract T cells and program them to perform vital immune functions .
They found that some tumors can secrete this protein to transform the outer layer of the tumor into lymphoid - like tissue .
This outer layer then attracts and effectively re-programs the T cells to recognize the tumor as friend not foe , resulting in a tumor that goes undetected by the immune system .
Since most tumors progress only if they have escaped the immune system , this new understanding of one mechanism by which the tumor can bypasses or hides from immune defenses is an important step towards future cancer therapies .
" The finding that tumors can attract naïve and regulatory T cells and educate them has important implications for tumor immunotherapy , " says Jacqui Shields , from LLCB .
The study also opens up potential novel areas of research focusing on the relationship between lymphatic systems and cancer research .
According to Shields , the concept that tumors mimic lymphoid tissue to alter the host 's immune response represents a new understanding of tumors ' interactions with the lymphatic system .
The laboratory is affiliated with the EPFL's Institute of Bioengineering and the Swiss Institute for Experimental Cancer Research .
Authors include Jacqueline D. Shields , Iraklis C. Kourtis , Alice A. Tomei , Joanna M. Roberts , Melody A. Swartz , from the the Laboratory of Lymphatic and Cancer Bioengineering at EPFL , Lausanne , Switzerland .
Jon Venables served eight years for murdering James Bulger Calls to raise the age of criminal responsibility from 10 to 12 have been rejected by the government .
England 's children 's commissioner Maggie Atkinson had told the Times that most criminals under 12 did not fully understand their actions .
But the Ministry of Justice said those over 10 knew the difference " between bad behaviour and serious wrongdoing " .
Dr Atkinson said James Bulger 's killers should have been helped to change their lives and not tried in an adult court .
She also said civilised society should recognise that children who commit offences needed to be treated differently from adult criminals .
She later issued a statement in which she said she wished to put into context her views on " such terrible atrocities " as James Bulger 's killers and two young brothers who tortured other children in Edlington .
Dr Atkinson said in the statement that such children were " a danger to themselves and to others " and that they should be contained in secure settings .
The age of criminal responsibility in many European countries ranges between 14 and 16 , but in England , Wales and Northern Ireland remains at 10 .
In Scotland , the age is currently eight , but legislation is being passed to raise it to 12 .
AGES OF CRIMINAL RESPONSIBILITY 7 - Switzerland , Nigeria , S Africa 8 - Scotland , Sri Lanka 10 - England , Wales , Northern Ireland , Australia , New Zealand 12 - The Netherlands , Canada , Greece , Turkey 13 - France 14 - Italy , Germany , Bulgaria , Romania , China 15 - Denmark , Sweden , Norway , Finland , Czech Republic , New York ( US ) , South Carolina ( USA ) 16 - Spain , Japan , Texas ( US ) , Poland 18 - Belgium , Luxembourg , most US states A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said : " We do not intend to raise the age of criminal responsibility .
It is not in the interests of justice , of victims or the young people themselves to prevent serious offending being challenged .
" Custody for under - 18s is always a last resort and is only used for the most serious , persistent and violent offenders .
" Only 3 % of young offenders who admit or are convicted of an offence receive a custodial sentence and the government has expanded the range and intensity of community sentences available for young people , as an alternative to detention . "
Dr Atkinson told the Times that " even the most hardened of youngsters who have committed some very difficult crimes are not beyond being frightened " .
She said it was also wrong that Jon Venables and Robert Thompson , who were 10 when they snatched two - year - old James from a Merseyside shopping centre in 1993 , had been tried in an adult court , not a youth court .
" What they did was exceptionally unpleasant and the fact that a little boy ended up dead is not something the nation can easily forget , but they should n't have been tried in an adult court because they were still children , " she said .
Relatives ' opinions
The system must recognise that although people may be offenders they are also children , Dr Atkinson added .
HAVE YOUR SAY
I think the age of criminal responsibility is too variable per individual child to pen down to a specific age Sparramedic " [ Venables and Thompson ] needed to be in a contained environment like a youth justice facility and to be given whatever programmes would help them turn their lives around . "
In her later statement , she said : " I empathise with the pain and anguish felt by all the families of the victims involved .
Children who carry out such atrocities and other serious offences need to understand the severity of their actions .
" The age of criminal responsibility in England is one the lowest in Europe .
" The statistics show that we are in danger of criminalising too many children and young people by locking them up for committing far less serious crimes . "
Dr Atkinson 's comments come in a week when James 's mother , Denise Fergus , met Justice Secretary Jack Straw to discuss Venables ' recall to prison after a suspected breach of the licence under which he was released in 2001 .
The shadow justice secretary , Dominic Grieve , said changing the age of criminal responsibility was " not the answer " .
He said : " We need fundamental reform to address the causes of offending by children , including family breakdown , poverty , gang culture and school discipline . "
Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg said he agreed with the principle that the nation was " criminalising far too many young children " .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
He also said there should be efforts to stop a transformation of the " young offenders of today into the hardened criminals of tomorrow " .
Juliet Lyon , director of the Prison Reform Trust , said it " would be wise to review the age of criminal responsibility , taking into account standards set by the UN Convention and international comparisons " .
Professor Rod Morgan , former chairman of the Youth Justice Board , said : " In no other country in Western Europe would Jon Venables have been prosecuted .
" A welfare approach with very young children offers a much greater range of opportunities and much better outcomes than is the case if we take a wholly criminal justice response . "
Prof Morgan said that instead , the child would be subjected to family court proceedings and would probably be taken into care .
After snatching James , Venables and Thompson walked him more than two miles to a railway line , where they beat him to death .
The killers were given new identities on their release in 2001 .
The Crime and Disorder Act 1998 abolished the presumption the under - 14s in England and Wales did not know the difference between right and wrong .
Until then those aged between 10 and 14 would only be brought before a criminal court when prosecutors could show they knew their actions were wrong .

Enlarge By Robyn Beck , AFP / Getty Images California 's massive budget shortfall of more than $ 20 billion last year prompted it not only to delay tax refunds but to issue billions of dollars in IOUs to vendors and others who were owed money .
STATE TAX REFUNDS STATE TAX REFUNDS
Officials in the following states say they have had to delay issuing refunds or consider doing so because the state might not have the cash on hand to cover the checks .
Hawaii
Alabama
North Carolina
Kansas
Idaho
New York Source : USA TODAY research Residents eager to get their state tax refunds may have a long wait this year :
The recession has tied up cash and caused officials in half a dozen states to consider freezing refunds , in one case for as long as five months .
States from New York to Hawaii that have been hard - hit by the economic downturn say they have either delayed refunds or are considering doing so because of budget shortfalls .
" It 's an indicator of how bad it is , " says Scott Pattison , executive director of the National Association of State Budget Officers .
" You know things are bad when you have to do that . "
New York , hit with a $ 9 billion deficit , may delay $ 500 million in refunds to keep the state from running out of cash , says Gov. David Paterson .
WHERE DOES YOUR MONEY GO ?
Enter your salary and see how tax rates have changed over time Hawaii's Department of Taxation says some residents may not see state income tax refunds until the end of August , The Honolulu Advertiser reported .
It was part of a plan by Gov. Linda Lingle to deal with a revenue drop - off by pushing costs into the next fiscal period , which begins in July .
States often do not have a timetable for refunds because delays are based on cash flow .
Most states typically issue refunds within 30 days .
Delaying refund checks is n't unprecedented , Pattison said , but it is something virtually no politician wants to do , because taxpayers are owed the money and in most cases want it fast .
Delays in paying refunds and other state bills can trigger interest on those overdue payments , depending on state laws , he said .
California 's massive budget shortfall of more than $ 20 billion last year prompted it not only to delay tax refunds but to issue billions of dollars in IOUs to vendors and others who were owed money .
State Controller John Chiang called the delayed payments a " shameful chapter in the State 's history " when the IOUs ended last September .
California still faces budget problems , but Chiang said that revenue is running ahead of projections so far this year , lessening the threat of a repeat .
" Californians should expect to receive their hard - earned tax refunds on time , " Chiang said .
The delays come as some states continue to face deep budget holes , even as economists say the nation as a whole has begun recovery .
In a recent report , the budget officers group and the National Governors Association said state fiscal conditions " have continued to worsen , " and that state revenues can be expected to lag one to three years behind a national recovery from recession .
This fiscal year , the report said , 36 states have cut nearly $ 56 billion in spending , and 30 states have cut funding to public and higher education .

Last week , Square Enix producer Shinji Hashimoto stated that he was intending to suggest a possible re-release of the ninth installment in the Final Fantasy - series at the next board meeting .
Today , Hashimoto has sent out a Tweet stating that since this year makes the tenth anniversary of Final Fantasy IX , many of the Square Enix board members were in favor of re-releasing the game via Playstation Network .
An official announcement should come later this week .
Final Fantasy
IX was originally released in 2000 for the Playstation in Japan and North America , with a release in Europe following in 2001 .
Hironobu Sakaguchi , the founder of the Final Fantasy series and president of the Mistwalker studio , once stated that Final Fantasy IX is the “ closest to [ his ] ideal view of what Final Fantasy should be . ”
Final Fantasy VII and Final Fantasy VIII have previously been re-released on Playstation Network , and are currently available for download at $ 9.99 each .
Computer experts from some 30 organizations worldwide have once again compiled a list of the 25 most dangerous programming errors along with a novel way to prevent them : by drafting contracts that hold developers responsible when bugs creep into applications .
The list for 2010 bears a striking resemblance to last year 's list , which was the first time a broad cross section of the world 's computer scientists reached formal agreement on the most common programming pitfalls .
The effort is designed to shift attention to the underlying mistakes that allow vulnerabilities to happen in the first place .
The updated list was spearheaded by the not - for - profit MITRE Corporation , the Sans Institute , the National Security Agency , and the US Department of Homeland Security 's National Cyber Security Division .
Topping the vulnerabilities list are XSS ( cross - site scripting ) , SQL injection , and buffer - overflow bugs .
The 25 flaws are the cause of almost every major cyber attack in recent history , including the ones that recently struck Google and 33 other large companies , as well as breaches suffered by military systems and millions of small business and home users .
Its release on Tuesday coincided with a renewed push for customers to hold software developers responsible for the security of their products .
Security experts say business customers have the means to foster safer products by demanding that vendors follow common - sense safety measures such as verifying that all team members successfully clear a background investigation and be trained in secure programming techniques .
" As a customer , you have the power to influence vendors to provide more secure products by letting them know that security is important to you , " the introduction to Tuesday 's list states .
It includes this draft contract with other terms customers should request . ®
Rating Summary
In this action role - playing game , players ' objective is to defeat an alien enemy that is silently abducting entire human colonies .
Players must assemble a team of henchmen , command a space ship , and travel to distant planets across a futuristic galaxy .
At its core , the game involves a combination of conversation / interaction with characters , and ground - based ( i.e. , " run-and - gun " ) space battle :
Players use assault rifles , submachine guns , shotguns , and pistols to kill humans , robots , and aliens in the frenetic third - person firefights .
Some enemies emit large splashes of blood when shot ( particularly with " head shots " ) ; several enemies lie stagnant in pools of blood — factors for the Mature rating .
Henchmen are able to freeze and shatter enemies , engage in melee attacks , set robots on fire , and use telekinesis to disable aliens .
A handful of cutscenes depict dramatic interrogations in which human characters are threatened , punched , kicked , and shot ( in the leg ) by alien creatures .
The game contains themes of illicit drug use , addiction , and trafficking — often focal points to the branching storylines ; for example , " Morinth likes dancing while on a drug called Hallex , " " Narcotics flooded my veins when I attacked , " and " The asari injecting so many drugs into me was terrifying . "
During the course of the game , players may enter a bar where alien pole dancing exists ( choreography highlighted on big- screen monitors ) or hear suggestive comments such as " krogan sexual deviants enjoy salarian flexibility " and " if this is just about sex , maybe you should just f** king say so . "
[ Italics added ]
Players can also choose to have " romantic encounters " with the alien / human henchmen characters ; this involves watching a guided cutscene in which two characters flirt , kiss , and / or embrace : clothed alien / human characters may prop a partner on top of a space console , clear away the clutter from a bed - slab , unzip a future - blouse , or just talk it out .
Though an alien / human may gyrate her hips while on top ( fleeting — one - to - two seconds ) , actual sex is never depicted — the camera cuts away to space furniture and ceilings .
So , what the Premier League chief executive , Richard Scudamore , must have thought would never happen , to a gilded club reaping the riches he delivers for them , has finally befallen Portsmouth .
Since the Premier League was formed in 1992 , as a breakaway by the then First Division clubs so they would not have to share their forthcoming satellite TV bonanza with the other three divisions , Football League clubs have collapsed insolvent , usually into administration , 53 times .
It has become a grim part of the job at Football League headquarters to talk to administrators , deal with millions of pounds unpaid to people who dealt in good faith with the historic names of English football , and worry whether clubs ' carcasses will be bought up and some financial life breathed into them .
Now Scudamore , between negotiating another bumper round of new international TV deals for 2010 - 13 , will have to spend time himself contemplating a furious HM Revenue & Customs with unpaid Pompey tax bills , fret over whether the club will be bought at a knockdown price and survive , and approve football 's dire system of insisting millionaire players are paid in full while ordinary businesses , public bodies and the tax man are left high and dry .
Around the world , even as crowds still thrill over the action served up by the world 's richest league and broadcasters prepare to pay a total understood to be around £ 1.1 bn for the TV rights , this season 's Premier League table will forever show an asterisk next to one of the 20 clubs , with nine points deducted , for falling into financial ruin .
The Premier League rejects the idea that this is a major embarrassment that should prompt a bout of soul - searching .
Portsmouth 's collapse is due to rank bad management and overspending , they say .
That is true , and it is the administrator 's job to decide whether the problem results from even worse practices than that .
But as far as we know , Portsmouth did nothing against any rules ; they followed the accepted Premier League model for a club – overspending , beyond the club 's true means , financed by loans from an owner and banks .
Portsmouth 's core problem at the end of Sacha Gaydamak 's ownership last summer was that he , who had passed the fit and proper person test and satisfied the league he owned the club rather than his father , the now convicted gun-runner Arkadi Gaydamak , had become simply not rich enough .
Then the overspending became unsupportable and Pompey , three owners later , have collapsed .
The latest , Balram Chainrai , loaned money , apparently £ 17 m , into the club in return for mortgages on Fratton Park and the club itself , and it should be noted that this gives him priority to be repaid first and , most likely , emerge again as Portsmouth 's owner .
The players have to be paid in full for the club to be allowed to continue , and the " ordinary " creditors , again , will be paid a fraction of what they are owed .
That is what infuriates HMRC about football clubs , and the tax authorities are certain to be left short again .
This vulnerability in the game 's makeup , the reliance on owners , was precisely identified by the FA chairman , Lord Triesman , in his famous speech at the Leaders in Football conference of October 2008 , in his early days , when he believed his job was to help pull the game into some agreed order .
" Debt is at high risk levels , " he said .
" The clubs are owned by either financial institutions , some of which are in terrible health , or very rich owners who are not bound to stay , or not very rich owners who are also not bound to stay . "
For speaking that truth in public he was vilified , and even as Portsmouth , among others , have proved his warning right , Triesman has not felt able to speak out again or gather support for solid action .
The Premier League points to new rules it introduced last summer , including a " going concern " test by which accountants will examine future financial projections for a club .
It is not clear these go far enough , because while Gaydamak was putting the money in and banks were lending , Pompey , coming back with the FA Cup on an open - top bus , presumably looked healthy enough into a foreseeable future .
Uefa have moved , introducing their " financial fair play " initiative , which will require clubs to be breaking even from 2012 - 13 , an act of almost heartbreakingly simple leadership .
The Premier League does agree but argues that owners should still be allowed to take over clubs and put money in to fund overspending .
That , though , is the inflationary lottery Uefa is seeking to solve .
At Manchester United and Liverpool , the takeovers have loaded the great clubs up with debts .
At the clubs with owners putting money in , some are rich enough to sustain it , and do it relatively responsibly .
It does , though , inflate players ' wages at all clubs , fuelling overspending .
At some , Pompey now proving the point , the commitment will become too great once rich men pull out .
In the Football League , many of the insolvencies have been caused partly by the huge financial gap with the breakaway Premier League .
Now , the freewheeling way the great game is organised has finally claimed a victim in that golden circle , with Portsmouth , established in 1898 , becoming , in 2010 , the first club in the multibillion - pound Premier League to file for insolvency .

The second Bulgarian nuclear power station Belene could prove to be the ruling party 's warrant for staying in power .
This is the position of the leader of the opposition Union of Democratic Forces Martin Dimitrov who is also a co-resident of the Blue Coalition .
The Coalition asked the minister of energy and economy to be heard in Parliament regarding the intentions of the government to continue the construction of the second nuclear power station .
As euinside wrote on Tuesday , minister Traykov announced that Bulgaria could take 2 bn euro loan from Russia for the station .
According to Martin Dimitrov , this project will be a very serious test for Bulgaria 's economy because there is no money in the budget to finance it and also that 2 bn euro Russian loan would lead to unseen and unheard dependence from Russia .
" If the station is to be realised in this way , it will bind Bulgaria to Russia even more than the president Gheorghi Parvanov and the tri-partite coalition did " , Martin Dimitrov warned .
The other political parties did not comment on the issue which for unknown reasons was not in the headlines for most of the media in Bulgaria .
The idea of a Russian loan of 4 bn euro was mentioned for the first time a year ago .
Then the Russian side announced that the money was ready and it was only waiting for Bulgaria to agree to take it .
The then - government denied to had asked for Russian financing .
A year later , the government of the ruling party GERB seems much closer to such a step .
Jan Haverkamp from the Greenpeace commented for euinside that the Bulgarian government should consider the proposal for a Russian loan as a warning :
" This is half of what Russia offered earlier .
Obviously , Russia is getting the same fears that has kept away other potential investors in Belene and that drove out RWE : the chance the project will be finished is minimal .
That Russia now seeks support for this 2 billion loan may well have to do with its own miscalculations .
It already ordered large parts and obviously it is looking for ways to make Bulgaria pay for that .
The Bulgarian government should take this as a clear warning .
The Russian side is not interested Bulgaria .
Bulgarian interests are better served with an investment of 2 Billion Euro in the development of energy efficiency and renewable energy sources .
It is no problem finding investors for such projects nor implementing them .
The only problem is that NEC ( National Electricity Company ) as grid operator is blocking such solutions " .
According to Petko Kovachev , executive director of the Green Policy Institute , it seems there is some nervousness and pressure from Russia because some steps were taken , especially with regard to Nabucco and the Kozloduy nuclear power station , which show an attempt for detachment from the Russian energy influence or , at least , for renegotiation of some conditions .
" We should see whether these renegotiations are in public interests or the " beneficiaries of corruption " are just been renegotiated " , Kovachev added for euinside .
And with regard to the loan conditions , according to Petko Kovachev there are several schemes possible .
For example , assets from the Bulgarian energy could be put at stake against the 2 bn euro .
These could be the assets of the future second power station or the Bulgarian Energy Holding which , not coincidentally was estimated to cost 4.5 bn euro ( Moscow offered the same amount of money as a loan for the project of the previous government ) .
The holding consists of the Kozloduy nuclear power station , Bulgargaz , the steam power plant Maritsa - East 2 , the coal mines Maritsa - East , etc .
Another possible scheme could be " Western " investors to be found and they will actually be companies , operating with Russian capital and registered in the EU , Kovachev deliberated .
Is the government indeed going to ask Russia for a loan as as to continue the construction of Belene and at what conditions , is expected ti become a bit clearer in Friday when in Sofia will arrive the director general of Rosatom Sergey Kirienko together with the Russian minister of energy Sergey Shmatko .
The Oscars are nothing more than highly paid famous people jerking off other highly paid famous people in front of a live audience in the hope that the American public will fall more in love with them ... and give them more money .
And because I was forced to sit through the entire ceremony , I thought I 'd give you my take on the winners .
The Oscars are nothing more than highly paid famous people jerking off other highly paid famous people in front of a live audience in the hope that the American public will fall more in love with them ... and give them more money .
And because I was forced to sit through the entire ceremony , I thought I 'd give you my take on the winners .
- Motion Picture : " The Hurt Locker . "
This was a fantastic movie .
It was tense , it was well acted , and it had a great pace .
If I can tell how a movie is going to end within 10 minutes of watching it , it is n't a good film .
Luckily , the Hurt Locker was unpredictable up until the last minute .
Further , it put a spotlight on people who deserve to be honored , rather than the plasticized magazine cover models .
And my girlfriend had to hide in the closet during the final bomb defusing because she was so nervous ... also , I 'd locked her in there for burning the pot roast again .
- Actor : Jeff Bridges , " Crazy Heart . "
That Jeff Bridges won is a great thing .
That he had n't won previously is astonishing .
He was The Dude !
He was Starman !
He was Kevin Flynn !
It took way too long to get him a win , and I 'm happy he finally took home the prize .
If he 'd turned into a LightCycle after his speech and drove away , I would have shit pixels .
- Actress : Sandra Bullock , " The Blind Side . "
I did n't see this film because I do n't have a vagina ... or a heart .
But , honestly , Bullock should have won for her riveting performance in Demolition Man .
- Supporting Actor : Christoph Waltz , " Inglourious Basterds . "
Personally , no one deserved it more .
Waltz scared me shitless in this movie , but had me laughing the entire time .
You'd be hard pressed to name another performance that could do that as well as his performance in ' Basterds .
- Supporting Actress : Mo'Nique , " Precious : Based on the Novel ' Push ' by Sapphire . "
Johnny put it best on his Facebook status this morning ...
" Still ca n't get over the fact that the winner for Best Supporting Actress was the judge on " Flavor of Love : Charm School . "
Does n't seem right . "
- Director : Kathryn Bigelow , " The Hurt Locker . "
She deserved it for no other reason than she was sitting in front of her ( also nominated ) ex-husband James Cameron , but unlike James did n't need a titanic budget to tip the scales .
( See what I did there ? )
- Foreign Film : " El Secreto de Sus Ojos , " Argentina .
Did anyone see this film ?
Me neither .
- Adapted Screenplay : Geoffrey Fletcher , " Precious : Based on the Novel ' Push ' by Sapphire . "
I have n't seen this film , but what pissed me off about this movie is that it 's official title contains the phrase " Based on the Novel ' Push ' by Sapphire . "
That 's just annoying .
That 's just self - aggrandizing .
Further , why did n't the film take on the abbreviation P.B.O.T.N.P.B.S. ( or " Pabotnapibs " ? )
- Original Screenplay : Mark Boal , " The Hurt Locker . "
Mark Boal has definitely seen some shit .
- Animated Feature Film : " Up . "
Fuck you " Up " for making me cry ... twice .
This was a fantastic movie .
It was emotional , but it was also hysterical .
One of the funniest ( and best comedically - timed ) sequences in recent years was when the character Russell is being slowly slid along the outside of a window and all you hear is the squeak of the glass .
Watch that scene again and you 'll see what I 'm talking about .
Pure genius .
- Art Direction : " Avatar . "
Avatar probably deserved this .
It really was a beautiful movie .
Considering I spent most of the movie trying to catch a nip - slip from the hot blue chick , the art director should also be credited with giving me blue balls .
- Cinematography : " Avatar . "
( See above )
- Sound Mixing : " The Hurt Locker . "
You 're probably aware of my crush on this movie .
But if you have the chance , watch it again and pay attention to the use of the different sounds in the movie .
The use of plane engines , heartbeats , and trucks have never been used so well .
- Sound Editing : " The Hurt Locker . "
( Again , See above )
- Original Score : " Up , " Michael Giacchino .
What 's great about this score is that it actually has a theme .
Most scores that have come out in the past few years ( save for Pirates of the Caribbean ) are often nothing more than subtle musical cues .
Giacchino has created a moving and memorable score that will hopefully bring us back to a time of John Williams and Ennio Morricone .
- Original Song : " The Weary Kind ( Theme From Crazy Heart ) " from " Crazy Heart , " Ryan Bingham and T Bone Burnett .
T Bone Burnett had the best acceptance speech of the night .
Two words : " thank you . "
- Costume : " The Young Victoria . "
Anyone who creates dresses that make chick 's boobs look several cup sizes larger than they actually are deserves an award .
- Documentary Feature : " The Cove . "
I can watch humans get the shit kicked out of them for hours on end without so much as a twinge of emotional resonance .
Show me animals getting hurt and I 'm ready to take up arms .
I have n't actually seen " The Cove " for no other reason than I do n't think I 'd be able to stomach it .
FYI , one of the producers , Fisher Stevens , played Ben Jabituya in the Short Circuit films .
- Documentary ( short subject ) : " Music by Prudence . "
I did n't see this one and , honestly , do n't remember anything about the acceptance speech .
- Film Editing : " The Hurt Locker . "
Enough has been said about this film already .
- Makeup : " Star Trek . "
I thought they gave this to Star Trek for making Zoe Saldana so beautiful , but then I realized that she 's just naturally that amazing looking .
So , really , all they 've done is give someone a trophy for putting pointy ears on some dude - a feat that was accomplished 10 years ago in the Lord of the Rings .
- Animated Short Film : " Logorama . "
If you can find the full length video of this online ( it 's a hard search , most of the videos have been taken down ) , check it out .
It 's worth 15 minutes of your time .
- Live Action Short Film : " The New Tenants . "
Shit , I did n't see this one either .
- Visual Effects : " Avatar . "
And , finally , the surprise dark horse .
Who would have thought this film would win for best visual effects ?
I did n't see this one coming .
' Course , I also thought Santa existed until I was 14 and assumed my ex-girlfriend was " only friends " with that firefighter who drove the motorcycle and called her in the middle of the night " just to talk . "
So that 's my take .
Blah blah blah dresses .
Alec Baldwin and Steve Martin were great .
I 'm not sure if Bruce " Just Because I 'm Strange Looking and Wear Stupid T - Shirts Does Not Make Me Funny " Vilanche is still writing for it , but the comedy seemed to be better this year .
Fans of thoughtful , well - crafted science - fiction had much to be pleased with in 2009 .
Star Trek , Cold Souls , Moon :
It was a movable feast of alternate realities and social commentary !
And the dual crown diadems in the last of the aughties were , without a doubt , Neil Blomkamp ’s District 9 and James Cameron ’s Avatar .
Aside from the fact that the difference between their budgets is roughly the GDP of a small European country , these two flicks have more in common than not .
Aliens ?
Check .
Next - level CGI ?
Check .
Overt social commentary in the form of an outsider who becomes the de facto leader of the subjugated aliens ’ resistance movement ?
Check and double check .
But more importantly , both films have been nominated for Best Picture in the 2010 Oscars — a blue - moon event , considering that the Academy is infamous for snubbing sci- fi flicks .
Which begs the obvious question :
Which of these two is better science - fiction ?
In those heady days of the ‘ 60s and ‘ 70s , before the genre became synonymous for extreme special - effects coupled with extreme brain - deadedness , sci-fi was a legitimate ( and arguably indispensable ) vehicle for social criticism .
Planet of the Apes , Close Encounters of the Third Kind and 2001 : A Space Odyssey made for tremendously entertaining popcorn fare , and were also piercing dissections of the social and political ills of their time .
Avatar is the odds - on favorite to win Best Picture , making the choice seem obvious .
But there ’s little doubt that District 9 is better sci- fi by merit of the issues it tackles .
Blomkamp ’s film skillfully blended issues of apartheid , authoritarianism and militarism , corporate malfeasance and humanity ’s perennial penchant for tribalism into a first - order morality tale ; the humans ’ cruelty to the Prawns is only magnified by the juxtaposition of their overtly - barbarous behavior with the seemingly - barbarous appearance of the aliens .
Avatar , conversely , is rightly criticized as Dances With Wolves or Pocahontas in space ; for all of the film ’s genuinely groundbreaking technical wizardry , the plot is a warmed - over mishmash of the Noble - Savage - Eco - Warrior tale , and ‘ stilted ’ is an over - generous description of the dialogue .
Moreso , the plot and characters are simply a too - familiar vehicle for the CGI .
Maybe a monorail tour is the most apt metaphor : Going in , we already know that Jake will infiltrate Na’vi society , come to sympathize with their plight , switch sides and become the savior of his former enemies .
District 9 gives us no such easy out .
Protagonist Wikus van der Merwe is selfish and sociopathic , and only begrudgingly teams up with the Prawns when his Cronenberg - esque bout of Body Horror leaves him no other option .
And that ’s the real crux of why District 9 is better sci-fi — Jake ’s transformation into a Na’vi is desired , Wikus ’ into a Prawn is not .
For Jake , arriving on Pandora is an escape from a sunless , polluted earth , and restoration for his physically - decrepit body .
His spiritual awakening hinges on his acceptance of the Na’vi way of life , and the audience knows it .
District 9 operates in less moralizing territory ;
Wikus must first de-evolve into a wretched , shambolic crab-person and accept the fate thrust upon him before he can atone for his sins .
Avatar consoles its audience with a Miltonian yarn of Paradise Regained , where District 9 shocks and horrifies by forcing them to confront the depths of their own Inferno .
Which means that Avatar is actually science - fantasy ( escapism ) to District 9s science - fiction ( social commentary ) .
There ’s nothing wrong with good ol ’ fashioned escapism , but it ’s a disservice to both films to confuse the two .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The United States reassured Israel on Tuesday that the two countries enjoy an “ unshakeable bond , ” but maintained pressure for a renewed Israeli commitment to peace talks with the Palestinians .
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton speaks during a joint news conference with Ireland 's Foreign Minister Michael Martin after their meeting at the State Department in Washington March 16 , 2010 .

“ We have an absolute commitment to Israel ’s security .
We have a close , unshakeable bond between the United States and Israel , ” Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said , moving to quell a diplomatic spat that has rocked ties between Washington and its closest Middle East ally .
Her comments marked a turn following days of tough talk after Israel announced last week it would approve construction of a Jewish housing project in East Jerusalem , infuriating the Palestinians and jeopardizing Middle East peace talks .
The White House has been criticized by U.S. lawmakers and pro-Israel lobby groups for its harsh stance toward Israel , which analysts said was likely one reason for its softer tone .
U.S. Mideast peace envoy George Mitchell on Tuesday put off plans to return to the region , and Clinton again pressed Israel to show it was serious about new peace moves .
“ We are engaged in very active consultations with the Israelis over steps that we think would demonstrate the requisite commitment to the process , ” Clinton said in an appearance with Ireland ’s visiting foreign minister .
The Israeli announcement undercut a deal brokered by Mitchell for Israel and the Palestinians to enter indirect talks , which the United States hoped would lead to a resumption of direct negotiations suspended more than a year ago .
The Palestinians have demanded that Israel halt the plan to build 1,600 new housing units at Ramat Shlomo , a religious settlement within the Israeli - designated borders of Jerusalem , before the talks can resume , but Israel has balked .
Hundreds of rock - throwing Palestinians clashed with police
on Tuesday in several locations in East Jerusalem , which Israel captured in a 1967 war .
Israeli police responded with teargas and rubber bullets .
State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said Mitchell still hoped to meet Israeli and Palestinian officials “ as soon as possible , ” but this would not happen before Middle East peace mediators meet in Moscow on Thursday and Friday as he had originally planned .
AWAITING ISRAEL’S RESPONSE
Crowley said U.S. officials expected a formal Israeli response shortly to a set of specific demands Clinton laid out to Netanhayu last week , and that this would inform the next U.S. moves on the issue .
A senior U.S. official said the response would likely come in a telephone call from Netanyahu to Clinton before she leaves for Moscow on Wednesday .
White House spokesman Robert Gibbs , echoing Clinton , also sought to put the settlement dispute into perspective .
“ Mature bilateral relationships can have disagreements and this is one of those disagreements , ” he said .
“ It does not break the unbreakable bond we have ” with Israel .
A senior Obama administration official , speaking on condition of anonymity , dismissed any suggestion that the administration was adopting a tougher line on Israel .
“ We are not searching for conflict here .
We were responding to what was a very counter - productive announcement .
We had a strong disagreement with that action , ” he said .
He also denied the administration had softened its language following Tuesday ’s comments by Clinton and other officials about the unshakeable bond between the United States and Israel .
“ The language ( condemning the housing project ) reflected our position , that is our response to the announcement .
That position remains , ” he said .
Clinton , who last week called Israel ’s announcement “ insulting ” , on Tuesday brushed away suggestions that the U.S. - Israeli relationship was in the midst of its worst crisis in decades .
“ We share common values and a commitment to a democratic future for the world , and we are both committed to a two - state solution ” for Israel and the Palestinians , she said .
“ But that does n’t mean that we are going to agree .
We do n’t agree with any of our international partners on everything . ”
Clinton said that , while the United States had expressed “ dismay and disappointment ” over the Israeli announcement , it was now time to move forward .
“ I think we ’ll see what the next days hold and we ’re looking forward to Senator Mitchell returning to the region and beginning the proximity talks , ” Clinton said .
Where did my check go ?
My check went away because I did n’t read my Policies and Procedures .
I decided to take a year off from the business do to health concerns and with in a few months of not building my business they slowly took my checks to the point I had to start all over again .
But this time I started with reading Success in ten Steps by Michael Dlouhy .
Once I read this book I found that companies with long wordy policies and procedures are only out to save interest for the company not the distributors .
What they were missing were the 5 pillars to a successful business .
Pillar 1 : Does the company management have personal experience building their own networking organization ?
Have they done it with Integrity ?
Pillar 2 : Has the company passed the “ early failure ” Time Line ?
Are the company ’s Products timed with the beginning of a massive trend of consumer demand ?
Pillar 3 : Does the company have a Remarkable product at a reasonable price ?
Pillar 4 : Does the Compensation Plan Pay Part - Timers ?
Pillar 5 : Does your Mentor offer a System for Success that will work for You ?
Without these you can only hope to live a life of abundance .
Now that I am learning all of the tools and skills I can start my new business and get my residual income so I can again take time off with no worries maybe even retire .

In an interview with Newsmax , Mitt Romney was asked about a growing libertarian movement within the GOP , and Ron Paul ’s victory in the CPAC straw poll .
Romney managed to dismiss the defeat and also claim that , “ I do n’t think there is a growing portion of Americans who are Ron Paul devotees . ”
Romney completely dismissed Ron Paul and his CPAC straw poll victory .
Here is the video from Newsmax ( Relevant video starts at 11:25 ) :

Romney was asked if there is a growing libertarian movement in the GOP .
He answered , “ I do n’t really see any change in the libertarian effort .
There has long been a libertarian strain in American politics .
It typically comes together with the Republican Party , but it ’s been part of conservatism for a long time .
The good thing about libertarians is that when they are called to show up somewhere they do , and when they get a call in the night saying hey , we need you to show up at CPAC , or show up at a straw poll , or show up at an event , they ’ll show up , and you gotta congratulate them for that , but I do n’t think there ’s a growing portion of Americans who are , if you will , Ron Paul devotees , but he has an influence , and welcome his participation to our party .
It ’s a big tent party . ”
When asked for comment about Romney ’s downplaying of Paul ’s CPAC win by CNN , Paul spokesman Jesse Benton wrote in an email that , “ ” It takes a tremendous amount of both support and organization to win a straw poll with the prestige of CPAC’s .
We are proud that Dr. Paul has both .
The message of liberty and sound money is growing every day , and Dr. Paul is honored to be one of the leading spokesman . ”
Notice the obvious contradiction between Romney ’s statement that the GOP is a big tent party , and his complete dismissal of Ron Paul and the libertarians .
I would think that if the Paul supporters are so motivated and dependable , then they would be just the kind of activists that a Republican candidate for president would court , not dismiss .
Paul ’s CPAC win was n’t because the deck was stacked with his supporters .
The message behind his victory was that Republicans are looking for a truly conservative candidate , which is something that neither Romney nor Palin actually are .
The Republican Party is small right now , and it is a big mistake for any candidate to ignore the will of the GOP ’s activists .
No matter who the Republicans nominate in 2012 , they will likely lose to Obama , such is the power of an incumbent president , but Romney seems completely ignorant of the battle being waged for the future direction of the Republican Party .
I do have to give Romney and Newsmax credit for properly separating the corporatized Tea Party movement from Paul and libertarians .
They are not the same thing .
I think the Tea Party will fade away as soon as the economy improves , but the libertarians are a group of passionate , dedicated , long term activists , who have already demonstrated their potential during the 2008 Ron Paul presidential campaign .
Mitt Romney or any other mainstream Republican is a fool to ignore them .

Rachel Maddow continues hitting the Republicans for their rank hypocrisy on slamming the stimulus bill while at the same time celebrating the benefits of the stimulus in their home districts .
For more here 's the report from Think Progress on these hypocrites -- REPORT : After Voting To Kill Recovery , 110 GOP Lawmakers Tout Its Success , Ask For More Money :
How do you make a 17.9 % increase in crashes look like a success ?
Make up a formula that says so .
A recent report by a citizen of Las Cruces , New Mexico illustrates how far cities are willing to go to protect their ticket camera programs .
At the Las Cruces City Council Work Session , there was a 9 - month update on the city ’s red light camera program .
The results show that total crashes at three intersections have gone up from 39 before the cameras to 46 after the cameras .
However , the city wants to keep the ticket camera program and they know that reporting those kind of results could jeopardize its future so they decided to create a formula that shows that the cameras have improved safety in the city .
This is a screenshot of the results that they presented , along with the formula they created called the Severity Index ( SI ) :
As you can see , even using their made - up formula , two of the three intersections were worse off with cameras .
They also failed to include data from a fourth intersection — possibly because the results were even more damning .
Furthermore , the single fatal crash that swings the formula in favor of the cameras was a drunk driving fatality that would have occurred with or without the cameras .
Ultimately , the only statistically - significant change from pre-camera to post - camera is a 36 % increase in property damage crashes .
While this report out of Las Cruces is a minor example of statistical manipulation , it ’s important to take any report from a ticket - camera city with a grain of salt .
They have a vested interest in keeping the cameras so they ’re likely to only present statistics that make the cameras look effective .
SierraSnowboard.com just got axed by Burton , the industry ’s largest producer of hard and soft goods .
There is some disagreement over the terms of the license , and when / whether the retailer is allowed to mark down current year ’s merchandise and to what extent , etc. Sierra dropped prices on Burton gear like 40 % a few weeks ago , and they ’re blowing it all out at 50 % .
Here ’s my initial thoughts on the blowup .
I ’m trying to remain as neutral as possible here , without pointing fingers at either party , placing blame , or whatever .
It ’s just my perspective .
I see a lot of economic on the forums and around the interwebs .
I do n’t want to get in a pissing match , so I ’m going to try and take a level - headed approach as best I can .
One error in their logic is the assumption that if Sierra did not discount Burton snowboards , that Sierra would still sell the same quantity of Burton snowboards .
This is demonstrably false .
They will just have more unsold merchandise even later in the year when it is even harder to sell .
In most industries , the manufacturer sells the product to the retailers at a price which is sure to cover their costs .
Then , the retailer sells the products to consumers , makes a nice margin .
The manufacturer ’s risk is that they produce in advance , and may not be able to move all their inventory on to retail shelves at such a price to satisfy their margins .
The retailers ’ risk is that they may not be able to sell the merchandise at a price which exceeds their costs ( of acquisition , overhead , etc . )
And there is no magic formula for business success — whether you ’re a manufacturer , a distributor , a retailer .
Nobody knows with certainty how many to make a year in advance .
It ’s all a calculated gamble .
If you overproduce , you ’re going to get stuck with a bunch of unsold merch and you ’re going to lose money .
If your business model consists of “ offloading that risk on to our retailers ” then you ’re not doing right by them , and you ’re not doing right by your customers , either .
Now , when the retailer takes a loss in order to cut losses , or sells at a discount in order to move inventory and make room for stuff that will better help him stay in business , the manufacturer has already made their margin on that product at the time it was sold to the retailer .
It makes no difference whether the retailer sells the product , if it is stolen from the retail shop , or whether the retailer decides to burns it all to the ground .
The manufacturer has already made his margin .
If the stuff ca n’t sell , obviously it might send some signal about what to do next year , but that is the beauty of the price function — it ’s only the most fucking important thing in all of economics , so deal with it .
For the latest updates , follow @agnarchy on Facebook :
If the manufacturer ca n’t support marketing of their new models at a market - price ( as opposed to “ MSRP ” which is the economic equivalent of reading tea leaves ) then they ’re doing something wrong .
They ’re spending too much on “ marketing ” and not enough on developing products which give consumers a bigger bang for their buck by leveraging technology to make equipment less expensive ( but still profitable ) or by developing new technologies at affordable prices .
Look – online and discount sales has n’t killed any industry yet .
But we constantly hear about how it ’s going to destroy snowboarding or the music industry or whatever .
What it does do is to force change in the way things are done .
Dinosaurs do n’t like this .
Some go extinct , and others adapt to the changing environment .
It ’s the organizations which are most able to adapt to changing pressures that succeed in the long run .

A male contraceptive pill will soon be here but do women really want it ?
According to a chuckling John Humphreys on Today ( BBC radio 4 ) this morning the men of the future are going to say " do n't worry dear I am on the pill " before they haul unsuspecting young maidens into bed , impregnating them and presumably disappearing into the night .
Well I am sorry but I know few young women daft enough to fall for that one and frankly my concern is not so much for the men who forget to take it as for those who wo n't stop taking it .
While we are transfixed by the idea that men might at last be able to share the loss of libido , weight gain , and general grumpiness which so often accompany pill taking for women we are in danger of losing track of the bigger issue : control of conception .
The pill gives women control of the fertility tap .
She decides when to turn it off but just as important she decides ( after discussion we hope ) when to turn it back on .
It is easy to forget in the heat of debate that we do n't just want to stop babies .
We want to have them too .
That wanting is not logical , it is not therefore easily planned .
For me ( and I suspect most women of my acquaintance ) wanting a baby is about holding a warm sweet weight in your arms , about the feeling that seems to run through your bones and end up twitching the corner of your mouth into a smile .
It is something akin to , but quite different from , desire .
I do n't pretend to know how men feel about babies ( I am sure you will tell me though ) .
My sense is that most regard pregnancy first with shock ( have I really done that ? ) then panic ( can I pay for it ? ) and then wonder .
It is the wonder that gradually turns to love .
At the moment it is the woman who retains control over the moment at which that melting in the bones feeling is allowed to over - take the firm " no this would ruin my life " feeling in the head .
Of course we all know stories of women who have put off having babies because their partner does n't want them .
( Too often they end up alone when their partner leaves and shacks up with some women who immediately gets pregnant . )
But it is , I would suggest , quite rare for a woman who has a fertile partner and wants to have a baby , not to find someway of convincing him that it would be a good idea .
Sometimes it is not so much convincing him as presenting him with a fait accompli - just letting nature take its course .
What will happen when it is the man who controls the tap ?
Of course lots of mature couples will maturely make a decision to stop taking the pill when the house has been bought and the job is secure .
But what about the people who are never quite sure that the time is right ?
What will happen to their babies ?
Will the male partner feel able to risk making a ' mistake ' when it is his partner who will carry the burden of the pregnancy ?
Will the woman feel able to persuade her partner to stop taking the Pill when she is n't really sure herself that this is what she wants ?
Ambivalence is normal when contemplating a decision that will truly change the rest of your life .
But ambivalence can be a tricky thing when one person carries the can for the decision while the other controls it .
And on a lighter note , if a couple do decide to stop taking the pill and try for a baby will they make the sort of mistakes that women so often make ?
I have lost count of the number of students who get pregnant in their final year .
They obviously meant to have a baby after finishing their course but they mistimed it .
It was their mistake , they take the rap and somehow manage to struggle through the last part of their degree .
How are they going to feel when it is their partner who mistimed it ?
Will they forgive him as they try to juggle finals with a baby on their laps ?

Fractions of a Second : An Olympic Musical
At the Olympics , the blink of an eye can be all that separates the gold medalist from the 10th - place finisher .
In some events , this is obvious .
But in others , with athletes racing one by one , the closeness of the race is harder to perceive .

Icebergs off Greenland :
The review looked at changes in Arctic sea ice A review from the UK Met Office says it is becoming clearer that human activities are causing climate change .
It says the evidence is stronger now than when the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change carried out its last assessment in 2007 .
The analysis , published in the Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews Climate Change Journal , has assessed 110 research papers on the subject .
It says the Earth is changing rapidly , probably because of greenhouse gases .
In 2007 the IPCC 's report concluded that there was " unequivocal " evidence that the Earth was warming and it was likely that it was due to burning of fossil fuels .
Since then the evidence that human activities are responsible for a rise in temperatures has increased , according to this new assessment by Dr Peter Stott and colleagues at the UK Met Office .
The Met Office study comes at a time when some have questioned the entire basis of climate science following recent controversies over the handling of research findings by the IPCC and the Climate Research Unit at the University of East Anglia .
Dr Stott denies that the study has been published as part of a fight back by the climate research community .
" We started writing this paper a year ago .
I think it 's important to communicate to people what the science is showing and that 's why I 'm talking about this paper . "
' Consistent picture '
The study , which looks at research published since the IPCC 's report , has found that changes in Arctic sea ice , atmospheric moisture , saltiness of parts of the Atlantic Ocean and temperature changes in the Antarctic are consistent with human influence on our climate .
" What this study shows is that the evidence has strengthened for human influence on climate and we know that because we 've looked at evidence across the climate system and what this shows very clearly is a consistent picture of a warming world , " said Dr Stott .
The study brings together other research from a range of disciplines .
It 's important to communicate to people what the science is showing
Dr Peter Stott " We had n't [ until now ] looked in detail at how the climate system was changing , " says Dr Stott .
" [ Our paper looks at ] not just the temperatures but also the reducing Arctic sea ice and it includes changing rainfall patterns and it includes the fact that the atmosphere is getting more humid .
" And all these different aspects of the climate system are adding up to a picture of the effects of a human influence on our climate . "
The Met Office study said that it was harder to find a firm link between climate change and individual extreme weather conditions - even though models predicted that extreme events were more likely .
According to the report : " Extremes pose a particular challenge , since rare events are by definition , poorly sampled in the historical record and many challenges remain for robustly attributing regional changes in extreme events such as droughts , floods and hurricanes . "

A new report claims Apple has attempted to push music publishers away from participating in Amazon 's MP3 Daily Deal promotion , which features timed exclusives for popular tracks .
According to an executive who spoke with Billboard , the Daily Deal has been around since mid-2008 , but it was in 2009 , when Amazon asked labels to provide a one - day exclusive before an album 's street date in order to be featured in the promotion , that Apple became unhappy .
Granting 24 - hour exclusivity gave the album promotion across the Web , on various Web sites and social networking feeds .
The labels reportedly paid nothing for the promotion , but simply exchanged the temporary exclusivity for increased exposure .
With the deal potentially taking customers away from Apple 's own iTunes Music Store , the report said that the iPod maker decided to intervene .
" Sources say that iTunes representatives have been urging labels to rethink their participation in the Amazon promotion and that they have backed up those warnings by withdrawing marketing support for certain releases featured as Daily Deals , " the report said .
Apple 's alleged approach has apparently worked : Major labels decided not to include high - profile releases such as " Need You Now " by Lady Antebellum and " Animal " by Ke$ha in Amazon 's Daily Deal .
The first participant in the Amazon promotion , which started Apple 's displeasure , was reportedly Mariah Carey 's " Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel , " which sold for $ 5.99 a day before its Sept. 29 street date last year .
Amazon , however , has not been idle as Apple has allegedly become more aggressive with publishers .
Bloomberg reported that Amazon has been " fine - tuning its Daily Deal pitch " for new titles , " agreeing , for instance , to forgo the one - day exclusive window on certain ones . "
Apple , however , allegedly remains upset with the Daily Deal promotion .
A week ago , Apple 's iTunes sold its 10 billionth song , achieving the milestone nearly seven years after the online download destination was introduced .
Recent figures have found iTunes to represent a quarter of all U.S. music sales , making the service the largest single music retailer in the nation .
Digital downloads make up an estimated 35 percent of total music sales , and iTunes accounts for 69 percent of those .
Apple , in the past , has had heated negotiations with music labels over content on iTunes .
In early 2009 , Apple convinced record labels to remove digital rights management from its music downloads , but in the process it conceded price flexibility .
Starting last April , some popular tracks saw a 30 percent increase in price , from 99 cents to $ 1.29 .
A recent case from the Dallas Court of Appeals ( Woodland vs State ) discusses the use of prior convictions in “ he said / she said ” sexual assault cases .
First , what is a “ he said / she said ” sexual assault case ?
It ’s when the main evidence in a case is the complaining witness testifies , and so does the defendant .
We are going to skip the issue of if a defendant should or should not testify in right now .
Can prior convictions be used against a defendant in sexual assault cases ?
The answer is , probably if the prior convictions are germane to the new offense .
So a DWI might not be admitted , but a case regarding sexual assault or sexual misconduct can be .
There is a general rule that prior convictions may not be used to show “ character conformity ” , that is , that the defendant is guilty because he is a criminal .
But , in sexual assault cases there is a special provision , 38.37 of the Code of Criminal Procedure , that allows prior convictions to be used against a defendant .
Here is a quote from the court -

AFP profiles the “ science ” classes at Liberty University , to which Christian students are flocking to learn how to defend Creationism :
They plan to become doctors , researchers and professors , but these students from Liberty University , an evangelical school , also believe God created the Earth in a week , some 6,000 years ago .
Each year , a group of biology students at the Christian university based in Lynchburg , Virginia , travels to the Natural History Museum in Washington to learn about a theory they dismiss as incorrect — Darwin ’s theory of evolution .
The young “ creationists ” examined a model of the Morganucodon rat , believed to be the first and common ancestor of mammals that appeared some 210 million years ago .
Lauren Dunn , 19 , a second - year biology student , was unimpressed .
“ 210 million years , that ’s arbitrary .
They put that time to make up for what they do n’t know , ” she said .
Nathan Hubbard , a 20 - year - old from Michigan and a first - year biology major who plans to become a doctor , regarded the model with suspicion .
“ There is no scientific , biological genetic way that this , this rat , could become you , ” he said , seemingly scandalized by the proposition .
…
David DeWitt , a Liberty University biology professor , opens his classes with a prayer , asking God to help him teach his students .
“ I pray that you help me to teach effectively and help the students to learn and defend their faith , ” he says … “ Creationism and evolutionism have different ways of explaining the evidence .
The creationist way recognizes the importance of Biblical records , ” said [ Liberty professor Marcus ] Ross .
He teaches his students that dinosaurs were wiped from the face of the Earth some 4,000 to 5,000 years ago during the Biblical flood that Noah survived by building an ark .
He says carbon - dating techniques that have been used to suggest the Earth is in fact billions of years old are simply not reliable .

How is babby formed
In their many years together , the Grateful Dead came to mean a lot of things to their thousands of listeners and showgoers .
Inspiring legions of musicians after them , as well as the legions of tapers and " Deadheads " who faithfully attended their gigs , the group 's music drew from the spectrum of American blues , jazz , country , rock , and psychedelia , coalescing into a sound the band 's taken on the road ( and occasionally the studio ) for years .
The group started in Palo Alto , California as the Warlocks in 1964 , where guitarist / singer Jerry Garcia met bass player Phil Lesh and lyricist Robert Hunter , as well as singer / keyboardist Ron " Pigpen " McKernan and guitarist Bob Weir ( both of whom Garcia played banjo with in Mother McCree 's Uptown Jug Champions ) , eventually adding Bill Kreutzmann on drums and changing their name to the Grateful Dead .
In the San Francisco Bay Area , they became very well - established as a live act , living in the famous Haight - Ashbury district in its heyday , and going so far as to be invited in as the house band at Ken Kesey 's Acid Tests .
Their shows with other local psychedelic bands made San Francisco venues like the Fillmore and Winterland legendary .
Eventually signing to Warner , they released their three studio albums before the end of the decade : 1967 's Grateful Dead , 1968 's Anthem of the Sun , and 1969's Aoxomoxoa , which , although not as exciting as live recordings from that time , present interesting portraits of their early psychedelic rock sound with songs like " Caution ( Do Not Stop on Tracks ) " and " Cream Puff War . "
It was with the release of 1969 's Live Dead that the band truly found their feet recording - wise , meeting demands for a live record and giving a glimpse into their immense abilities as performers , especially on the recording of longtime fan favorite " Dark Star . "
1970 's Workingman 's Dead and American Beauty are the two records widely considered to be their studio peak , introducing such classic songs as " Casey Jones " and " Friend of the Devil . "
Following a second self - titled album and the live double - album set Europe ' 72 , McKernan tragically passed away in 1973 due to liver failure , and was replaced on keyboards by Keith Godchaux .
His wife , Donna Jean , would be a back - up vocalist group for most of the ' 70s .
From the early ' 70s onward , the band 's studio output was pretty erratic :
After 1980 's panned Go to Heaven , their focus turned wholly towards the road , and they would continue to tour year - round for the remainder of their existence .
The group hit a low with Garcia 's five - day diabetic coma in 1986 , but the following year , they scored a surprise Top 10 hit with " Touch of Grey " , which sparked anew popular interest in the group , along with 1989 's Dylan & the Dead , recorded live with Bob Dylan .
Garcia 's health problems gradually worsened , and he passed away of a heart attack at a rehabilitation clinic on August 9 , 1995 .
Although the Grateful Dead never really sold a tremendous amount of records , they 've maintained an incredibly loyal fan base to this day , and the remaining members regularly sell out contemporary concerts , performing as the Other Ones , the Dead , and as various solo / collaborative acts .
WASHINGTON — Former Senator Alan K. Simpson , the co-chairman of President Obama ’s bipartisan commission for reducing the mounting federal debt , figures that with the country in danger of “ going to the bow - wows , ” he has bigger things to worry about than whether “ Rush Babe ” and other conservative critics are “ babbling into the vapors ” that he is not Republican enough for the job .
That is Simpson - speak , recognizable to anyone familiar with Mr. Simpson ’s way of treating serious issues with folksy phrases and sometimes stinging humor during 18 years as a senator from Wyoming .
But this is no joke :
The Republican Party ’s insistence that no real Republican would even consider raising taxes is a big reason that many people believe the president ’s panel will never agree by December on a bipartisan multiyear plan to narrow the growing gap between spending and revenues .
“ Alan Simpson ’s a great guy , but he ’s not going to bring along Republican votes on Capitol Hill , ” said Vin Weber , a former congressman from Minnesota who was part of a younger generation of Reagan - era tax - cutters .
“ He ’s always been a Republican that would be willing to raise taxes , but that ’s not where today ’s Republican Party is . ”
That is likely all the more true of the Republican Party in an election year , especially when it is courting the zealously antitax , small - government Tea Party voters .
Still , it is a measure of the building concern about the nation ’s fiscal future that some Republicans outside Congress are beginning to challenge the party ’s antitax orthodoxy .
It 's not the first time that Israel has stiffed Barack Obama over his attempts to kick - start Middle East peace negotiations .
But the sudden , highly inflammatory announcement of plans to build an additional 1,600 homes in occupied East Jerusalem , in the midst of a visit to Israel of US vice - president Joe Biden , was certainly the most brutally contemptuous rebuff so far to American peacemaking .
It may be that Binyamin Netanyahu , Israel 's rightwing prime minister , was unaware in advance of the provisional decision by a Jerusalem district planning committee , as he claims .
But the announcement was promulgated by his interior ministry , which thereby gave it an official stamp of approval .
If Netanyahu did not know , then why not ?
Despite the evident embarrassment and considerable political damage caused by the decision , Netanyahu has so far made no move to repudiate it .
Lesser figures , such as welfare minister Isaac Herzog and Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev were deployed on firefighting duties on Wednesday , dutifully uttering conditional words of contrition .
" We have to express our apologies for this serious blunder , " Herzog said .
But protestations of innocence by interior minister Eli Yishai , head of the Shas religious party in Netanyahu 's coalition and no great advocate of American attempts to forge a two - state peace settlement with the Palestinians , are hard to credit .
" There was certainly no intention to provoke anyone , and certainly not to come along and hurt the vice - president of the United States , " Yishai said .
These are weasel words .
Is it to be believed that Yishai , like Netanyahu , was unaware of what his own ministry was doing ?
Did he have no idea the planning decision was pending ?
Did he , as an experienced politician , not foresee the destructive political implications of this ambush ?
Like Netanyahu , Yishai presumably regards Jerusalem as Israel 's eternal and indivisible capital .
Another day on , it seems he was determined to rub Biden 's nose in that insupportable idea .
The Americans , until now , have been too polite , or too weak , to say it , but Netanyahu spent most last year deliberately frustrating Obama 's pledge to mediate a resolution of the Israel - Palestine conflict and with it , an end to the Israel - Arab confrontation that has scarred the region for generations .
Netanyahu resisted direct talks , rejected a full settlement freeze , flaunted his uncompromising views on Jerusalem , pooh - poohed a Syria opening , and , at the same time , endlessly reiterated his supposed willingness to talk to the Palestinians " without conditions " .
Simultaneously , Israel 's leader tried , with some success , to shift the US conversation on to Iran , which he says poses an existential threat to his country and the region .
All in all , it was an Oscar - standard performance in obfuscation , prevarication and disingenuousness .
To the achingly smart , but politically less pugnacious Obama , Netanyahu 's behaviour was intellectually insulting .
The fact he has put up with it until now may be a measure of Israel 's clout in Washington , especially on Capitol Hill .
This could change .
Obama 's problem , and not just in the Middle East , is that he is liked but not feared .
After a first year in office devoid of substantive achievement , Washington insiders say the president must show he is ready to fight , to get down and dirty , to drop his professorial aloofness and get publicly passionate and angry about the things he believes in .
At home , this could apply to healthcare reform .
Abroad , the new approach may single out Israel - Palestine .
Biden 's visit , though reassuring and conciliatory on the surface until the east Jerusalem bombshell dropped , may mark the start of this tougher approach .
Many Obama supporters in the US and Europe , and in the post - Cairo Muslim world , will wish it so .
The vice - president , whose attack dog qualities were unleashed on the subjects of Russia and Ukraine last year , certainly did not mince his words , once he realised the extent of the insult .
" I condemn the decision by the government of Israel to advance planning for new housing units in east Jerusalem , " Biden said .
" The announcement ... is precisely the kind of step that undermines the trust we need right now and runs counter to the constructive discussions that I 've had here in Israel . "
In the last part of this sentence Biden seems to be suggesting that Netanyahu told him one thing to his face and did another behind his back .
Little wonder he kept Israel 's first couple waiting for dinner .
It does n't seem to realise it , but Israel cannot afford to keep on behaving in this disobliging manner towards its friends .
Whether it is blatant disregard for international rules concerning the protection of civilian life , as in Gaza ; whether it is calculated insults aimed at neighbours , as with Turkey ; or whether it is the theft of passports and identities from friendly countries and the lawless assassination of its enemies , as in Dubai , it goes too far .
Now , Netanyahu has deeply angered his country 's best and most powerful friend – again .
The coming message to Bibi : do n't over - reach .

Cheryl Maher , the New Hampshire woman who says she had an affair with Layton Rep. Kevin Garn in 1985 and was paid $ 150,000 to keep her secret , says Garn is lying about a naked hot tub encounter between them when she was 15 and he was 30 .---
Garn told reporters last night ,
I can unequivocally tell you there was no physical contact , there was no touching , there was no intercourse , there was none of those things .
It simply did not occur .
... I 'm not trying to downplay what did occur but I want to make it very plain .
Maher says he 's lying , but is hesitant to give her version of events .
" Let 's just say this .
He really loves to massage , " Maher told City Weekly when asked for details of the contact in the hot tub .
Maher , though , talks less about how that particular encounter traumatized her and more about the emotional relationship she had with Garn .
" I was in love with him , " she said .
She kept her secret for many years , but by 2002 was communicating with news reporters and prosecutors .
At that time , she accepted a $ 150,000 payment from Garn and signed a confidentiality agreement , she says .
Download e-mails between Garn , his wife , Maher , and her husband from 2002 and 2003 when the payment was made
She 's also angry at The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints , who she accuses of being notified of the abuse on multiple occasions and not offering her adequate services or support , even as Garn 's position in the church -- from her perspective - - was unaffected .
Garn , Maher says , was her fourth grade sunday school teacher , though their affair would n't begin for several years after that .
" In the church , people feel they can trust everybody , " said Maher , who was excommunicated a few years ago for an extra-marital affair .
" You 're supposed to be safe with the priesthood holder , or whoever you 're with .
And I think my Mom and Dad felt that way .
' He 's taking her out to lunch .
Oh , he 's taken her shopping .
She 's taken care of . '
They had no idea .
That was the trust in the church and I think that needs to be looked at . "
When asked if she thought the church has already changed on those matters since her incident in 1985 , she said no .
" That is my experience all the way until now , that no one wants to believe a priesthood holder will hurt someone , but that 's not the case , " she said .
" In 1993 , Kevin Garn went into repent for what he 'd done ... I was n't notified , I was n't checked on , like , ' Are you OK ? ' that kind of thing .
There 's no communication .
' This man has admitted what he 's done , we want to help you , are you OK with what happened in your past ? '
[ My experience ] was ' Good luck to you , thank you , we 'll check into it . '
That makes me angry . "

About the Spectrum Dashboard
The Spectrum Dashboard provides a public means of reviewing how spectrum bands are allocated and for what uses , and who holds licenses and in what areas .
This version provides basic , plain language information about frequencies generally deemed appropriate for mobile broadband ( 225 MHz to 3700 MHz . )
In addition , Spectrum Dashboard contains more detailed information , mapping , and research capabilities for the bands where broadband service is either already available , or potentially could be provided .

What is Spectrum ?
Spectrum is the range of electromagnetic radio frequencies used to transmit sound , data , and video across the country .
It is what carries voice between cell phones , television shows from broadcasters to your TV , and online information from one computer to the next , wirelessly .
The FCC and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration ( NTIA ) share responsibility for managing the spectrum .
NTIA manages spectrum used by the Federal government ( e.g. , military , NASA ) and the FCC is responsible for spectrum used by others , including individuals ( e.g. , garage door openers and wireless Internet connections ) , commercial operators ( e.g. , radio and television broadcasters , mobile phone providers ) , and public safety and health officials ( e.g. , police and emergency medical technicians ) .
Frequency bands are reserved for different uses .
For example , 88 – 108 MHz is used to broadcast FM radio to your car .
Whereas , one of the groups of frequency bands used for cell phones is 824-849 MHz and 869-894 MHz .
Because there is a finite amount of spectrum and a growing demand for it , effectively managing the available spectrum is an important priority for the FCC .
With the FCC Spectrum Dashboard , the public can now learn more about spectrum licenses across the country and areas where spectrum is currently available .
Use The Dashboard
Browse Spectrum Bands
Use the graphical spectrum band selection tool to browse allocations , enter specific frequency ranges or select one or more tags to determine potential frequency bands for new broadband products or other purposes within 225 MHz to 3700 MHz .
Browse Using a Map
Use an interactive map to find enhanced information on licensees that hold broadband spectrum within a particular county or state .
Create a map to depict the total amount of spectrum held in spectrum bands such as 700 MHz , 800 MHz Cellular , and PCS .
Search by Name Search by " common name " to determine who holds spectrum that could potentially be used to provide mobile broadband services , including the total amount of spectrum on a county - by - county basis for spectrum bands such as AWS , BRS , and 700 MHz .
Advanced Search Search by name , radio service , frequency range , channel block , or call sign to learn who holds spectrum licenses around the country .
You can also view a map of spectrum totals by county .

This is the second part of an “ Explained ” on climate change .
Part one dealt with radiative forcing .
Climate sensitivity is the term used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) to express the relationship between the human - caused emissions that add to the Earth ’s greenhouse effect — carbon dioxide and a variety of other greenhouse gases — and the temperature changes that will result from these emissions .
Specifically , the term is defined as how much the average global surface temperature will increase if there is a doubling of greenhouse gases ( expressed as carbon dioxide equivalents ) in the air , once the planet has had a chance to settle into a new equilibrium after the increase occurs .
In other words , it ’s a direct measure of how the Earth ’s climate will respond to that doubling .
That value , according to the most recent IPCC report , is 3 degrees Celsius , with a range of uncertainty from 2 to 4.5 degrees .
This sensitivity depends primarily on all the different feedback effects , both positive and negative , that either amplify or diminish the greenhouse effect .
There are three primary feedback effects — clouds , sea ice and water vapor ; these , combined with other feedback effects , produce the greatest uncertainties in predicting the planet ’s future climate .
With no feedback effects at all , the change would be just 1 degree Celsius , climate scientists agree .
Virtually all of the controversies over climate science hinge on just how strong the various feedbacks may be — and on whether scientists may have failed to account for some of them .
Clouds are a good example .
Clouds can have either a positive or negative feedback effect , depending on their altitude and the size of their water droplets .
Overall , most scientists expect this net effect to be positive , but there are large uncertainties .
“ There is still lots of uncertainty in what the climate sensitivity is , ” says Andrei Sokolov , a research scientist in MIT ’s Center for Global Change Science , who has been doing research on climate sensitivity for many years .
“ Feedback is what ’s driving things , ” he says .
It is important to note that climate sensitivity is figured on the basis of an overall doubling , compared to pre-industrial levels , of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases .
But the temperature change given by this definition of climate sensitivity is only part of the story .
The actual increase might be greater in the long run because greenhouse gas levels in the atmosphere could more than double without strong policies to control emissions .
But in the short run , the actual warming could be less than suggested by the climate sensitivity , since due to the thermal inertia of the ocean , it may take some time after a doubling of the concentration is reached before the climate reaches a new equilibrium .
They say “ statistics lie , ” but they do n’t .
People do .
Well , that ’s a little harsh .
Sure some people intentionally skew numbers and selectively pull data , but most folks misinterpret data by accident .
Why do you care if you ’re not a scientist ?
Because you collect data about your business all the time — web traffic , revenue sources , expenses , customer behavior — and make decisions based on your ( mis ) understanding of that data .
Here ’s a few basic mistakes I encounter constantly .
Statistics do n’t tell the whole story
It ’s easy to boil a data set down to a single number , like an average .
Easy — and often shortsighted .
Single numbers feel powerful ; you feel able to wrap your mind around a lot of data .
Sometimes that is indeed useful , but it can also obscure the truth .
Consider Anscombe ’s Quartet , four graphs that have identical statistical properties , yet clearly represent four distinct processes :
Since the statistics are identical in each case , it ’s clear that statistics alone do n’t describe what ’s actually happening with the data .
The true story of each graph :
The process is mostly linear .
The best - fit line is handy in describing the relationship , but there are other possibly - random factors at work as well .
The data are perfectly related , but not linear .
Applying typical linear statistics is just wrong .
The data are perfectly linear , with one outlier .
Probably the outlier should be ignored , and the best - fit line should reflect the other points .
The data do n’t vary at all in the x direction , except for an outlier which probably should be ignored .
All the standard statistical numbers are useless .
Lessons :
Processes ca n’t be boiled down to a single number .
Blindly applying statistics does n’t explain what ’s happening .
Charts can help .
“ Average ” is often useless
You ca n’t open an analytics tool without being attacked by averages :
Average hits / day , average conversion ratios , average transaction size , average time on site .
Trouble is , the average is often not only useless , but misleading .
Take “ average time - on - site , ” a typical web analytics metric .
It ’s important enough in Google Analytics that it appears on the top - level site information dashboard , as shown in this real example from my blog :
Of course it ’s better if a visitor spends longer on a site because it means they ’re engaged .
Is 1:33 good ?
Actually that ’s the wrong question .
The true story becomes clear when you break this single number into pieces :
The “ average ” time - on - site of 93 seconds is useless when trying to explain user behavior .
The correct way to think about time - on - site is :
Most visitors “ bounce ” off the site without really looking at it .
About a third of the visitors stayed long enough to read some articles .
Furthermore , the way you optimize # 1 and # 2 are completely different :
Bouncing can indicate that the traffic source is poor ( i.e. we attracted eyeballs , but they were n’t the right eyeballs ) or the landing page was poor ( i.e. we attracted the right eyeballs , but we failed to lure them into reading further ) .
Getting a few minutes of time on a blog is already “ success . ”
Trying to get someone to stay even longer ( e.g. 10 minutes instead of 5 ) probably is n’t useful .
So the better question is :
How do we get more people into this category , rather than trying to “ increase the average ” in this category ?
So not only is the average value 1:33 useless in describing reality , it ’s useless in deciding what to do next .
Lessons :
The simple “ average ” is often meaningless .
Using a single number to describe a process obscures the truth .
Using a single number to describe a process prevents you from learning how to improve and optimize .
The dangers of “ Top 10 ” and “ Others ”
Whether it ’s a cover article in Cosmo or a web analytics report , people love to read “ Top 10 ” lists .
Top lists can be useful .
For example , here are the origins of search engine traffic to my blog :
There are several “ other ” search engines ( e.g. Ask and AOL ) , but the traffic does n’t amount to a hill of beans ( as we say in Texas ) .
It ’s useful to cut those out of the chart because they ’re just noise .
The trouble starts when “ Other ” is n’t so trivial .
The following chart is a real report from a board meeting I was in years ago ( only the names and layout have been altered ) :
Looks fine .
But later I was poking around the data myself and decided to add a category for “ Others ” :
Some people call this the Long Tail — a pattern wherein a few big players are far larger than any other single player , but when you add up all the little players they collectively match or — as in this case — tower over the big players .
If you discover a Long Tail in your data , there ’s several ways to react .
Consider the case of having a Long Tail in sales of your product line , as with iTunes and Amazon who have a few blockbuster hits plus a long tail containing millions of products that sell infrequently .
Here are four opposing viewpoints of how you could approach the situation :
The Long Tail is too expensive to sell into because it requires reaching a lot of people , each of whom do n’t give us much money , so it wo n’t be cost - effective .
The Long Tail is the least expensive way to sell because it means reaching under - served markets , which means cheap ads and hungry customers .
Addressing the Long Tail means we have to be all things to all people , and that means we ’re unfocused .
Instead , let ’s try to be # 1 at one thing .
Trying to be # 1 at anything is hard , and often the spoils go to those with the most money , not to the smartest or most passionate .
Rather than fight the 800 - pound gorilla , let ’s address the rest of the market that gorillas ignore , but which contains a ton of potential business .
No one of these views is automatically correct .
For example , iTunes gets most of their revenue from the big players ( contrary to “ common ” knowledge ) , but other companies like Beatport make millions of dollars off the Long Tail of niche music markets ( electronic music , in their case ) .
The only wrong thing is to ignore your “ Others ” column .
Lessons :
“ Top 10 ” lists can hide important data .
Any time you truncate data you must first be certain you ’re not throwing away important information .
Data patterns like the “ Long Tail ” are n’t “ good ” or “ bad ” per se .
There are usually many equally - viable ways for you to react .
Metrics and statistics “ rules ” cannot be applied blindly
Consider the following ( intentionally unlabelled ) chart :
It ’s tempting to start making observations :
The average value is 57 .
( But you already know this is crap , right ? )
The value is generally increasing as we move to the right .
Some data is missing .
Maybe they should be discarded .
Unfortunately , even these basic observations are assumptions , and could be wrong depending on context .
Consider these scenarios :
These are a student ’s test scores over time .
The student was failing and not turning in assignments .
However , in the middle of the period the student hired a tutor .
Results improved , and by the end of the class the student had mastered the material .
This student should probably be awarded an A or B because of the clear improvement and steady results at the end of the year when tests are hardest .
The student should not receive a grade of 57 — the average .
Each result represents a survey of one person on the effectiveness of a certain advertisement .
The “ zero ” rating from subjects # 2 and # 4 is real data , and it ’s a bad sign .
This could indicate something drastically wrong with the ad , for example being offensive .
We need to dig in with those participants and learn more about this failure .
In general the average value — including the zeros — is probably a useful indication of the ad ’s overall effectiveness .
It ’s curious that the results “ improved ” so much in later trials since the participants were supposed to be randomized .
This may indicate a bias in the test itself .
An interesting result of # 1 is that in order to obtain a useful “ average ” value we ought to throw away almost all our data points !
The opposite is true with # 2 .
The point is that the context for the data determines how the data is interpreted .
You ca n’t blindly apply a “ rule , ” such as which data points can be ignored .
Lessons :
You have to interpret results in context , not blindly apply formulas .
Form a theory first , then see whether the data supports or invalidates your theory .
Formulas are not a substitute for thinking .
Like any tool , statistics is useful when used properly and dangerous otherwise .
Like any algorithm , garbage in yields garbage out .
Yes this means “ metrics analysis ” is harder than it looks .
Yes this means you have to take time with your data and verify your thought process with others .
But what ’s the alternative ?
Thinking about your processes incorrectly and then wasting time on senseless “ solutions ? ”
Final lesson :
Since metrics are hard and take time and effort to get correct , do n’t attempt to measure and act on 100 variables .
Pick just a few you really understand and can act on , and optimize with those alone .
You ’re more likely to make a genuine , positive change in your business .

Macroeconomics for the 21st century : Part 1 , Theory
Roger Farmer
What are the implications of combining Keynesian ideas with Walrasian general equilibrium theory in a way that does not assume sticky prices ?
This column presents the first of a two - part outline of a new macroeconomics paradigm for the 21st century , starting with the theory .
Modern Keynesians base their ideas on a version of Keynes ’ General Theory that assumes that prices and or wages are “ sticky ” ( Clarida et al 1999 ) .
In a pair of columns , I summarise results from a research agenda that reconciles Keynesian economics with Walrasian general equilibrium theory in a new way that does not assume “ sticky prices ” .
This column concentrates on economic theory .
The next column explains how my ideas are connected with previous attempts to reconcile these Keynesian and classical ideas , and it draws out the implications of my work for economic policy .
My research focuses on two key ideas from Keynesian economics and one from microeconomic theory .
The important Keynesian contributions are that free market economies may support any unemployment rate as an equilibrium and that the equilibrium we observe is selected by confidence or in Keynes ’ words “ animal spirits ” .
The key idea from microeconomic theory is that individuals are rational and goal - oriented and they do not make systematic forecast errors .
The theory that I will sketch out below is worked out fully in two working papers , ( Farmer 2009a , 2009 b ) and in two books , ( Farmer 2010a , 2010 b ) published by Oxford University Press .
Although I recognise that the market system may lead to inefficient outcomes with high unemployment , I do not believe that fiscal policy is the right response to a financial crisis .
My reconciliation of Keynes with Walras is different from the orthodox approach , and it leads to a different policy proposal that I describe in more depth in Part 2 of this series .
Technical assumptions
The model I will describe is designed to capture two key ideas .
First , any unemployment rate can be an equilibrium in the steady state .
Second , the equilibrium that prevails is picked out by animal spirits in the asset markets .
The simplest environment that captures my main idea has the following properties .
There are two distinct physical goods , capital and a consumption good .
I need this assumption to ensure that there is a relative price of capital so that one can meaningfully discuss changes in asset prices .
Labour is traded in a market with costly search and recruiting .
I need this assumption to ensure that unemployment persists in equilibrium .
There is a single unit of capital and a measure of labour of length one .
Think of this as a large number of workers .
The model will decide the fraction of them who remain unemployed .
Capital does not depreciate and cannot be reproduced .
It is owned by firms and traded in a frictionless rental market .
The return to capital represents the profit stream of the firm .
In the model , the price of a unit of capital and the price of a share in a company are the same .
In practice , the relative price of capital and the value of the stock market are very different concepts .
Complicating the model to allow for this distinction would not alter my main message although it is clearly important for empirical work .
There are two technologies .
One is a standard neoclassical production function that explains how labour and capital are combined to produce a good .
The other is a search technology similar to those that have been widely used in other search models of the labour market ( see Pissarides 2000 ) .
The search technology produces filled vacancies from unemployed workers and corporate recruiters .
These recruiters are employed workers .
Instead of working as recruiters they could alternatively produce commodities .
I simplify the model by assuming that the entire labour force is fired at the end of every period and rehired at the beginning of the next period .
This allows me to describe the equilibrium of the economy as a series of disconnected static problems .
In the real business cycle model that has dominated macroeconomics for twenty years , variations in employment occur because households choose to supply more or less hours to the market in response to variations in the wage over time .
I assume instead that households do not value leisure and all of their members would like to find a job .
Variations in employment , in my model , occur because of variations in the fraction of the labour force that are unemployed .
To close the model I assume in my working paper ( 2009a ) that there is a single infinitely lived family that maximises the utility of its members .
I show that this assumption implies that fiscal policy cannot be used to restore full employment .
In my other working paper ( 2009 b ) , I relax the representative family assumption by allowing for a more realistic demographic structure with birth and death .
I show there that fiscal policy can increase employment , but the fiscal multiplier is less than one and increased government purchases are predicted to decrease welfare .
The social optimum
Let ’s suppose that households can appoint a social planner to organise production .
This planner is charged with the task of maximising the welfare of the representative agent .
How would she behave ?
Since there is no feasible way to transfer resources from one period to the next , the planner faces a series of disconnected one - period problems .
In each period she will maximise consumption by optimally allocating workers between two tasks .
Some workers will be assigned to the direct production of commodities .
Others will be assigned to the task of searching for new workers to hire .
Since the activity of recruiting diverts resources from productive activity , the social planner will choose to leave some workers unemployed .
The problem of the social planner is depicted in Figure 1 .
The dashed curve represents the quantity of the consumption good that can be produced as the planner increases employment from 0 to 100 % of the labour force by adding more workers to the recruiting department .
Initially , adding more recruiters is productive and additional workers result in additional output .
But once the planner reaches L* , additional employment becomes counterproductive .
By employing additional workers , the social planner could achieve 100 % employment .
This is not a good thing to do since these workers would be so busy recruiting each other that no one would be available to produce goods .
1 - L* is a good candidate for what Milton Friedman ( 1968 ) has called “ the natural rate of unemployment ” .
Figure 1 .
The problem of the social planner
What goes wrong in the labour market ?
General equilibrium theorists have shown that under certain assumptions , free markets work well in the sense that a competitive equilibrium replicates the decisions that would be made by a benevolent social planner .
To decentralise a social - planning problem , general equilibrium theory posits the existence of a set of competitive headhunting firms that would operate the search technology .
These firms would purchase , from households , the exclusive right to match an unemployed worker with a vacant job .
They would purchase , from firms , the exclusive right to fill a job .
Although we do see headhunting firms , in practice these firms act as substitute recruiting departments for firms that are too small or too specialised to run their own operations .
They do not pay unemployed workers for the right to find them a job .
How would an organised employment market operate if it did exist ?
Suppose that a competitive headhunting firm were to offer to pay an unemployed worker for the right to match him with a job .
A dishonest unemployed worker could turn down every job offer and continue to receive payments while remaining unemployed .
Since there will often be good reasons to refuse a job , it would be impossible to write a contract in which the worker must take any job that he is offered .
A given number of jobs can be filled by a large number of unemployed workers and a few recruiters or by a few unemployed workers and a large number of recruiters .
But should society match workers with jobs by asking a few unemployed workers to search for a lot of vacant positions or a lot or unemployed workers to search for a few vacant positions ?
I argue that either outcome can occur in the real world because the price signals that tell firms and workers how to behave are missing .
Search equilibrium
Search theory provides an alternative description of how the labour market works .
Workers look for jobs , taking as given the probability that they will find one .
Firms assign workers to the recruiting department , taking as given the number of workers that each recruiter can hire .
Firms and workers take prices wages and rental rates as given as in Walrasian general equilibrium theory .
An equilibrium is a set of prices and a set of plans by firms and households such that firms maximise profit , households maximise utility , and demands and supplies are equated in all markets .
The firing probability of a worker and the hiring effectiveness of a recruiter are determined by the fact that the number of workers who find jobs must be consistent with the aggregate search technology .
These terms enter individual decision problems as externalities that appear , to the observer , to be productivity shocks .
The equilibrium concept I have described sounds a lot like the one used in search models that have been widely studied in the literature .
See , for example , the survey by Richard Rogerson , Robert Shimer and Randall Wright ( 2005 ) .
But my concept has fewer equations than unknowns .
Decentralisation of the social planning solution requires the addition of two markets and two prices :
One for the time of a searching worker and one for the time of a searching recruiter .
The search equilibrium adds just one price ; the money wage .
As a consequence , my model has many labour market equilibria in the steady state .
A given number of jobs may be filled by many searching unemployed workers and a few searching recruiters .
Or it may be filled by a few searching recruiters and a large number of unemployed workers .
The relative prices that should direct market participants to the optimal mix of unemployment and vacancies are missing .
I believe that search theorists have missed this fact because we are trained , beginning in graduate school , to look for a model in which prices and quantities are uniquely determined by fundamentals .
When confronted by an underdetermined model , existing theorists have chosen to add an equation in an attempt to bring the theory into line with existing general equilibrium models .
Typically they make the assumption , that when a firm and a worker meet , they bargain over the wage .
I believe that a more fruitful theory can be developed by throwing away this assumption and recognising that there is a pervasive labour market failure , and as a consequence , any unemployment rate can be an equilibrium .
Conclusion
Although my theory of aggregate supply sounds superficially like the Hicks - Hansen description of Keynesian theory that was taught to generations of economists in the post - war period , it is very different .
Unlike the Hicks - Hansen model , the equilibrium concept that I have described does not rest on some prices being away from their Walrasian levels and there are no forces in the model that cause some agents to want to charge different prices .
I have argued that it is time to drop the natural rate hypothesis and return to the Keynes of the General Theory .
This is not just empty rhetoric .
It has implications for the policies to be used to stabilise the real economy in the 21st century .
I take up this theme in a companion piece , “ Macroeconomic Policy for the 21st Century ” ( 2010d ) .
This piece is part of a published article in the National Institute Economic Review ( 2010 c ) .

Colloquial name in European politics for a large surplus of butter due to overproduction .
Even during the 1970s , when the European Economic Community was less integrated than it is today as the European Union , agriculture was one of its main interests and was the sector it dabbled in with the most pronounced and controversial results .
In fact the Common Agricultural Policy ( CAP ) , initiated in 1962 , absorbed 70 % of the EEC 's budget .
Perhaps the best known , err , landmark of that era was the agropolitical feature that became known as the butter mountain .
The adjoining milk powder and cheese mountains were part of the same harvest of bureaucratic brilliance and interventionism gone awry .
Now , we 're talking about a lot of butter here .
Farmers in Germany , the UK , Holland , and other countries had been encouraged to produce subsidised products in quantities that ended up dwarfing demand .
Enormous dairy subsidies had made milk and butter lucrative on paper but impossible to actually sell once produced .
At the rate they were going from the early 1970s until the mid-1980s , they were running out of storage space before the butter ran out .
In 1975 there were about half a million tons of unwanted butter waiting to be sold off for next to nothing .
Building the butter mountain came hand - in - hand with the CAP 's gravy train .
Solutions ranged from the economically twisted yet logical but otherwise absurd and unpopular , such as raising taxes on margarine , which many consumers preferred because it was cheaper , to the innovative suggestion made by the Monster Raving Loony Party in Britain to mold the mountain for use as Eddie the Eagle 's ski slope .
Given enough refrigeration , the latter suggestion was actually feasible since the mountain was literally big enough to serve the purpose .
Milk powder and butter were sometimes given away as food aid .
In the meantime and across the Channel from Brussels , Maggie Thatcher , milk snatcher became a slogan of the times as the distribution of free milk to school children was ended under her rule as Minister of Education , seven months before Britain signed the accession treaty to join the common market .
This was also her most notable achievement in the post .
Clearly they had better things to do with the milk once the country joined the EEC .
Like create a butter mountain .
At the peak of the butter mountain madness , butter was virtually given away to the Soviet Union at regular intervals or sold to low - income pensioners at steep discounts .
Part of it was even used as fuel in commercial electricity production .
The butter mountain almost spawned a couple of trade wars with other dairy producing countries .
This meant mainly the United States , where the Reagan administration had perpetuated and " improved " another subsidised surplus problem .
The American response to the butter mountain was government cheese .
Eventually , in 1985 , the EEC negotiated GATT permission to dispose of vast quantities of butter on the world market at low prices without getting nailed for dumping .
The butter mountain had its ups and downs and declined in volume by the end of the 1980s but took a very long time to go away .
Even the introduction of quotas for milk production in 1984 failed to stem its growth .
It peaked at 1.4 million tons in 1987 .
Even with dairy subsidies shrinking to 2.6 billion euros in 1999 , it persisted and reached a respectable size again after 120,000 tons of unsold export - subsidised butter were inventoried in the first half of 2002 .
This time the origins had shifted a bit .
Ireland and Spain were the largest producers of unwanted butter during that period .
Other " geographical " features to appear on the political map of Common Market Europe were the wine lake , the milk lake , a beef mountain and several varieties of grain mountain .
One expects that the admission of eastern European countries to the EU will reduce the excesses of the CAP by stretching funds more thinly .
On the other hand , this is the EU we 're talking about .
Perhaps the madness will be shifted to the results of environmentally friendly and morally admirable directives that come with no plans or budgets for their practical implementation .
There already are rumours of growing mountains of tyres and old refrigerators .
The butter mountain was eventually pronounced " melted " in 2007 , when the Finns , Czechs , and Spanish finally emptied their refrigerated vaults .
The possibility of future butter mountains is slim , though early 2009 did see the appearance of a modest , 30000 - ton butter mound .
This is not a result of policies such as the CAP , though , but rather a typical EU reaction to market conditions that took a toll on the dairy industry worldwide .

I noticed the same question on c.l.p that Steve Ferg responded to on his blog .
I was feeling too lazy to respond to the thread earlier but I thought I 'd throw my idea up on the ol ' blog before wrapping up for the day .
I think this is a classic use - case for class methods .
Here is my implementation .
class Vector ( object ) : def __init__ ( self , x , y , z ) : self .x = x self .y = y self .z = z @classmethod def from_sequence ( cls , sequence ) : return cls(* sequence ) @classmethod def from_vector ( cls , vec ) : return cls ( vec.x , vec.y , vec.z ) def __repr__( self ) : return " Vector ( %s , %s , %s ) " % ( self.x , self.y , self .z ) if __name__ == ' __main__ ' : print Vector ( 1,2,3 ) print Vector.from_sequence ( [ 4,5,6 ] ) print Vector.from_sequence ( ( 7,8,9 ) ) v = Vector ( 10 , 11 , 12 ) print Vector.from_vector( v ) ;
Here is the output from running the script :
Vector ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) Vector ( 4 , 5 , 6 ) Vector ( 7 , 8 , 9 ) Vector ( 10 , 11 , 12 )
I like the classmethod route because it is obvious what the code is doing , it makes it easy to add new from_\* methods and keeps the general __init__ method clean .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A West Point graduate who claimed his knowledge of physics allowed him to predict “ with an uncanny degree of certainty ” trends in the futures market was accused on Monday in Ohio of perpetrating a $ 30 million Ponzi scheme .
Federal prosecutors charged Cuyahoga Falls , Ohio , resident Enrique Villalba , 47 , with one count of wire fraud for allegedly scamming 26 investors out of $ 29.7 million through the sale and purchase of futures contracts .
Villalba , who also has a law degree , is accused of promising investors returns of 8 to 12 percent by using a “ Money Market Plus ” methodology and by combining his knowledge of physics with a unique “ momentum filter , ” prosecutors said .
The complaint also charged that Villalba did not put promised “ stop ” orders in place to prevent excessive losses and that he diverted millions of dollars in investor money to fund Rico Latte coffee shops in Ohio , to purchase real estate and to make payments to some investors .
A Ponzi scheme is one in which early investors are paid with the money of new clients .
Villalba ’s attorney , J. Timothy Bender , said that his client had voluntarily contacted the U.S. Attorney ’s office last August and was cooperating with authorities .
Bender said Villalba had sought to recoup investor losses through increased leverage , “ but those attempts not only failed but generated significant additional losses , ” which he did n’t disclose .
“ Mr. Villalba takes full responsibility for his actions and wishes to express how deeply sorry he is for the harm he has caused his clients , ” Bender said .
“ Any resolution of the case will undoubtedly include an order for restitution and Mr. Villalba is resolved to do everything possible to make his clients whole . ”
In addition to the criminal complaint , separate civil complaints were filed against Villalba on Monday by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission .
The criminal case is U.S. v. Enrique F. Villalba , U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio , No. 1:10 - cr-00133 .
Three years to the day after unveiling the Chevrolet Volt concept car , General Motors has started building the battery packs that will power the range - extended electric car – which may cost less than expected .
The first of the thousands of 16 - kilowatt - hour lithium - ion battery packs the General will need for the cars rolled off the assembly line today .
The packs , which use more than 200 cells apiece , are being assembled Detroit , making GM the first automaker to make lithium - ion packs in the United States .
" This is an important milestone for GM and a critical step in bringing the Chevrolet Volt to market , " said company chairman and CEO Ed Whitacre .
The Volt is slated to roll off an assembly line in Detroit by the end of the year , and for the first time GM said the car may carry a sticker price less than the $ 40,000 everyone 's expected it to cost .
General Motors has never said what the Volt might cost , but the company is widely expected to be doing everything it can to keep the price tag under 40 grand .
Jon Lauckner , GM 's head of global program management and the guy in charge of getting the Volt built , said the car could come in " notably lower " than that , according to Dow Jones .
" We have until this summer to figure that out , " Lauckner said at the ceremony marking the start of battery production .
Yes , a price north of $ 30,000 – even after the $ 7,500 federal electric - vehicle tax credit – is steep .
But batteries are expensive , and the pack in the Volt is no exception .
General Motors , like every other automaker developing electric cars , refuses to disclose the cost of the pack , but most EV experts say lithium - ion packs run $ 500 to $ 1,000 per kilowatt - hour .
The packs in the Volt are being manufactured at the Brownstown Battery Pack Assembly Plant in Brownstown Township outside Detroit .
General Motors spent $ 43 million and five months retooling the plant .
It sits on a 375 - acre site in an industrial park near two airports , where the lithium - ion cells would arrive from Korea .
The cells will be assembled into the 400 - pound T - shaped pack that will power the Volt , then sent up Interstate 75 to the Detroit - Hamtramck Assembly Plant where the range - extended electric car will be built .
The first packs are being built to make sure the manufacturing equipment is set up correctly .
Once finished , they 'll be used for testing .
Production of packs for cars we 'll see in showrooms will begin this spring .
General Motors is investing $ 700 million in eight factories throughout Michigan that will contribute components to the Volt and assemble the car .
The company also has spent $ 25 million on a 33,000 - square - foot Global Battery Systems Lab .
The lab will develop and test the drivetrains underpinning the Chevrolet Volt and other hybrid , battery - electric and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles .
The automaker believes the facility , at its sprawling Warren Technical Center campus outside Detroit , will help make it a market leader in battery and EV technology .
The Department of Energy awarded $ 106 million in grants in August to help refurbish the Brownstown factory under its $ 2.4 billion package to spur development of next - generation batteries and electric vehicles in the United States .
That 's on top of the $ 266 million the feds have invested to support development of the Volt , Energy Secretary Steven Chu said .
" We urgently need to change how we power cars and trucks , " Chu said , according to Reuters .
Chu , who attended the opening at Brownstown , said 99 percent of batteries currently used in hybrids are manufactured in Japan .

The death rate of women giving birth in the US is worse than in 40 other countries , including nearly all the industrialised countries , Amnesty International said today in a report that describes the country 's approach to maternity care as " disgraceful and scandalous " .
According to the World Health Organisation ( WHO ) , the likelihood of a woman dying in childbirth in the US is five times greater than in Greece .
The US has some of the best medical care in the world , but Amnesty says the lives of poor , uninsured , African American and Native American women are put at risk by neglect .
" This country 's extraordinary record of medical advancement makes its haphazard approach to maternal care all the more scandalous and disgraceful , " said US Amnesty executive director Larry Cox .
" Good maternal care should not be considered a luxury available only to those who can access the best hospitals and the best doctors .
Women should not die in the richest country on earth from preventable complications and emergencies .
" Mothers die not because the United States can't provide good care , but because it lacks the political will to make sure good care is available to all women . "
The US ranks 41st in the WHO 's league table of maternal mortality , with a risk of women dying in childbirth at one in 4,800 .
Top of the league is Ireland with one in 47,600 , which has partly to do with the small population , followed by Bosnia and Herzegovina and then Italy and Greece .
The UK ranks 26th with a risk of one in 8,200 .
The damning report comes in a year of unprecedented international effort to reduce the death rate among mothers in developing countries , which will include a major conference called Women Deliver in Washington in the summer .
The cause has been taken up by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton as well as Sarah Brown in the UK .
That context makes the Amnesty report all the more shocking .
Death rates among women in pregnancy and labour have doubled in the US from 6.6 per 100,000 in 1987 to 13.3 per 100,000 in 2006 .
Although some of the increase is due to better data collection , there is no doubt that deaths have risen while the technology and know - how to prevent them has improved .
Whatever form they finally take , President Obama 's healthcare reforms will not resolve the crisis of unavailable and unaffordable maternal care , says Amnesty .
The reform proposals will still leave millions without cover and do not address race discrimination , systemic failures and lack of accountability .
Amnesty is urging Obama to set up an office of maternal health to address the issues directly .
The report , Deadly Delivery , reveals that severe pregnancy - related complications that nearly cause death – known as near misses – are rising at an alarming rate , increasing by 25 % since 1998 .
Currently nearly 34,000 women annually experience a " near miss " during delivery .
Discrimination is costing lives , it says .
Women who are poor , who are African American , Native American or immigrants and those who do not speak English face serious barriers in obtaining care .
One in four women do not get the antenatal check - ups they need , which can warn of pregnancy complications .
Among African American and Native American women , one in three go without antenatal care .
One in five women of reproductive age ( 15 - 44 ) , amounting to about 13 million , are not insured .
Half of them are women of colour , says the report .
The burdensome bureaucratic procedures involved in Medicaid enrolment delay women access to check - ups , risking their lives .
Nearly a third of all deliveries in the US are by caesarean section , which is a rate twice as high as that recommended by the WHO .
Caesareans carry a risk of death three times as high as natural birth .
Amnesty says that the death rate in the US is probably even higher than it appears , because there is no federal requirement for the reporting of deaths in childbirth .

No correction or apology to Hoyt will be forthcoming as I , using Hoyt 's logic , did not claim the two events happened at the same time .
That type of extreme and faulty logic betrays a bias against accurately reporting the ACORN story and Hoyt has certainly sacrificed his credibility on , at least , this issue if not completely in his role as ombudsman .

Yesterday , as I was driving home I turned on NPR and they were explaining about the case where a judge upheld the decision that made the Congressional action of singling out ACORN for defunding was unconstitutional .
In the description of the situation leading up to the judges decision they referred to O'Keefe , Giles and Breitbart and the media storm that ensued from their " interview " with ACORN employees .
Nowhere in the short report did they mention the fact that these videos were highly edited , nor the recent decision by the DAs found that the video was highly edited and there was no case against ACORN or any employees .
They did find time to mention that the justice department could still appeal this decision .
Way to go NPR , there goes another media outlet that is not doing its job .

The NYT should not apologize .
They should pay ACORN an equivalent amount of money that ACORN was denied due to the NYT fostering the illegal Congressional act of attainder .

Clark Hoyt took off all his clothes and walked into the New York Times offices yesterday .
I 'm really suprised he was n't fired .
( Assuming , of course , that he showers daily and does it without clothes ) .

Congratulations on the progress you 've made on this issue , Brad .
It looks like David will eventually bring Goliath to his knees .
Looking in from outside , I try to imagine how you feel about this ludicrous drama , which seems to have started with your willingness to follow up on a reader 's perfectly reasonable email .
I wonder if the Times ' recalcitrance came as a surprise to you , or if you 'd already known how pathetic the Times ' internal correctives were .

Well well it only took me about 4 postings over at Patrick 's site to be put into moderation for supposed slander .
All because I said I thought someone in his role would act more professionally in their personal life .
It was in regards to him being put into moderation here for his personal attacks .
When he tried to play it off as him being put into moderation for stating what he said was the truth .
I was n't even debating him on the issues either .

I object to the claim that the NYT was " duped . "
One can not be duped when one willingly joins in a conspiracy to slander a fine organization such as ACORN .
There is no other explanation .
The NYT has a specific agenda , which is all - out war on what little democracy we once enjoyed in the U$A .
The NYT is a big business , and we all know what that means when it comes to truth , justice , and the ' murkan way .
What a pathetic excuse for a society , when everything , and I mean everything , is valued strictly according to dollar worth .

Mitch @ 9 asked : I wonder if the Times ' recalcitrance came as a surprise to you , or if you 'd already known how pathetic the Times ' internal correctives were .
In truth --- perhaps because I have the not - necessarily - helpful habit of giving everyone the benefit of the doubt and not assuming nefariousness until all other options are gone ---
I was , and continue to be rather stunned by the entire affair .
I believe I described it early on as being " gobsmacked " .
That feeling continues .
When Sr. Editor for Standards ( !)
Greg Brock described their source as Fox " News " and O'Keefe himself , I thought surely he was just being sloppy , lazy , using shorthand .
When he then went on , even after being called out on it , to seemingly make stuff up outta whole clothe , it became certainly more troubling .
But when Public Editor Clark Hoyt jumped in , a man for whom I 'd had some respect previously as a disinterested , honest party , but then , beyond all reason he continued to support what was clearly an untenable position , I became beyond - gobsmacked , but I do n't know a word for it .
I knew the NYT had serious internal failings .
But I 'd presumed they were largely based on laziness , lack of resources for a very big and important job , and the human failings we all have .
I would never have predicted that the NYT would go so far out of their way to NOT simply do the right thing , when doing so would have been so incredibly simple , and appropriate , for them to do .
To this day , I still try not to ascribe reasons for their now - obvious and monumental continuing failure , since I 'd simply be speculating , and I do n't do that here .
But I 'll tell ya , it 's getting damned difficult not to see the entire matter as nefarious , as so many have suggested to me for quite some time .
I do n't know that it 's nefariousness ( see the above about my proclivity to give benefit of the doubt ) , but I 'm being to run out of non-nefarious reasons to explain their continuing and seemingly self - defeating failures here .
In short : No , I 'd have never thought they'd have worked this hard to NOT do the right thing .
I was , apparently , very wrong about that .

Seriously Brad , after the last 15 + years of crap coming out of " The Paper of Record " ( starting most prominently with Lewinsky , the coverage of the 2000 election , and Iraq war cheerleading , and what have they done wrt election fraud / voting machines ) and their failure to own up to any of their " mistakes " and set the record straight on any of those failings you 're really surprised that they would n't feel the need to retract the ACORN " reporting " that they 've done ... this is just one more " story " in the narrative that they 've been pushing and you 're seriously shitting in their cornflakes .

Judge Instructs Fed Agencies to Resume ACORN Funding
Acornweb A federal judge has reaffirmed her earlier ruling blocking the congressional effort to defund the anti-poverty group ACORN .
On Wednesday , Judge Nina Gershon cemented a decision from last year that such action amounted to an unconstitutional “ bill of attainder . ”
Judge Gershon has asked all federal agencies to allow ACORN funding without delay .
We speak with National Housing Institute president John Atlas , author of Seeds of Change : The Story of ACORN , America ’s Most Controversial Anti-Poverty Community Group .

JOHN ATLAS : I ’m going to talk about that in a minute , but the first thing I want to say , that needs to be said over and over again , is that the act of defunding ACORN by Congress is a national disgrace .
We should all be outraged about that .
Basically what happened is Congress bowed to Fox News , Glenn Beck , the rest of the right - wing echo chamber — we ’re talking about the United States Congress — and then scapegoated the most effective anti-poverty organization in the country .
That ’s a scandal of enormous proportions .
ACORN has a record of helping poor people in these hard times .
They help them get homes .
They help them stop foreclosures .
They help them fight predatory lending .
They help them register voters .
I ’m talking about minority voters , people who ordinarily do n’t vote .
Very hard to get that kind of voter registration work done .
And in short , all other studies , including mine , have documented how effective ACORN has been and how important it ’s been to low - income people , especially the working poor .
OK , now , with the significance of the decision , first people have to understand the context .
This was a case in which the Congress defunded ACORN , and they claimed they had to defund ACORN to protect the taxpayers .
ACORN brought a lawsuit .
They brought it against the United States government , the Office of Management and Budget , the Secretary of HUD , and the Secretary of Treasury .
They had to bring a lawsuit against them because these were the people who issued orders , pursuant to the vote by Congress , to not allow ACORN to get any funding that it was entitled to , but did n’t get , and they could not , in the future , apply for federal funding .

The truth is that ACORN * is* a good thing .
The narrative that some people are trying to sell you is that ACORN is a nefarious , evil entity , committing crimes all over the place , and cheating in elections .
There is no real evidence of any of these negative accusations about ACORN , only manufactured evidence .
Despite a ridiculous number of investigations , no wrong doing has been found of ACORN , and very few of it's employees have been found guilty of wrongdoing ( most of the ones they did find were turned in by ACORN itself . )
However , there is another reason for people to hate ACORN : they register poor , democratic - leaning individuals to vote .
This is not in the best interest of the republicans , hence all of this manufactured evidence of wrongdoing , and misinformation being spread all over about them .
Oh wait , what was I thinking ?
Republicans do n't do shit like that .
Nevermind , ACORN must be guilty after all .
Otherwise ...
Well that would mean ...
Republicans will do anything to win ...
Which is a slippery slope ...

@ Chris Hooten and Big Dan I believe it is every person 's duty to help the poor .
When I first heard all the hoopla about ACORN I checked their history .
I was saddened to discover that this organization failed in its mission .
Somewhere along the line , a few of its leaders let greed and power destroy a potentially great organization .
Your comments , along with this blog have prompted me to dig some more .
I hope I will discover something redeeming about ACORN .
I will keep an open mind .
As a small business man I 've had some experience trying to have my voice heard so I could help enact change I believed would help other " small fry " like me .
I was given a platform then shown the door .
I 've been kicked around and almost crushed by the federal government and large corporate entities who do n't care one bit about an average working stiff like me .
I have learned that those with the money make and benefit from the laws .
Our reps on Capitol Hill might listen to the hoi poloi but will always support legislation driven by large corporations willing to pad the pols ' reelection campaigns .
So I respect any group that can organize and help make good things happen for the poor and other forgotten folks .
ACORN has done much good but they have made many mistakes .
I hope they can get their act together and give voice to the millions who have no real representation in Washington .

Perl One - Liner of the Month : The Mystery of the Red Worm
By Ben Okopnik
- " It 's just a little further along ... right through here , Frink . "
/var/log/ apache
" Ah , here we are - there 's ` / var / log / apache / access.log ' - and just in time from the looks of it .
The poor thing is up to 400MB and it's nearly filling up the partition , and it 's only been a few days since it was rolled over ! "
- " What happened here , Woomert ?
I just came in to tell you about the latest story in the newspapers , praising you to the sky for your solution to the Missing Databases Mystery [ 1 ] at the Bigrich Bank , and you dragged me off without a word .
Not that I mind , but ... "
- " I do tend to get a bit concentrated while on the job , do n't I ?
Oh well - there are worse things .
All right , here is what 's happening : the client , a small company that specializes in making horseshoe welding sprockets for accountants working in the napkin - fringing industry , has become suspicious of a few odd things happening with their web site .
For example , their response time often spikes right through the roof , and they 've been returning the ` Server busy ' message much too often as compared to normal operation .
There has n't been any huge jump in the amount of business they do - less , since the economy these days does n't permit too many luxuries like their product - so ... "
- " It sounds like a DoS ( Denial of Service ) attack , Woomert . "
Here , let 's test a few things .
First , though , lets make a couple of copies of this file where it wo n't cram things quite as badly ...
There , I 've put them both in ` / home / woomert '.
We do n't really want to lose any of the data if we should accidentally damage or destroy one file , do we ?
Now , let 's zero out the actual log and restart the server ... excellent .
Now - on to exploring the files .
Given that you suspect a DoS - I do , as well - what would you look for , Frink ? "
- " I 'm not sure , Woomert .
I think I 'd like to figure out the average hits per IP , and then maybe look at the sorted list of the same .
That would tell us if someone is really slamming this server and from where , do n't you think ? "
- " Why , Frink , that sounds like an excellent idea !
Yes , let 's take a look at the average :
perl - wlne ' / ^( \S+ ) /;$h{$1}++}{$a=@a=values%h;map{$b+=$_}@a;print$b/$a ' access.log
12.30830039525692
- " Hmm , interesting .
Taking into account that the number is going to be higher due to the very large DoS entries - we 're still assuming those , but it 's a fair bet - that 's not an unreasonable number .
Most people will probably examine a few models before making their decision to buy ; after all , it is a once - in - a - lifetime purchase .
In fact , this company led the rest of the pack in offering lifetime warranties ...
All right - now let 's look at that sorted list :
perl - wlne ' / ^( \S+ ) /;$ h { $ 1} ++}{ print" $ h{$ }\t $ " for sort{$h{ $ a}<=> $h{$b}}keys %h ' access.log

Woomert and Frink looked at the screen , at each other , and exchanged a high - five salute , with Frink adding his " double twist with finger snaps " variation .
- " You did indeed , Frink , It looks like a modified version of a common worm , Code Red .
The good news is that we 're not dealing with a particularly sophisticated attacker , though : a Code Red infection attempt , which is what this is , is not the same thing as a Code Red DoS , which is just a network slam of a specific IP - and it only works against legacy operating systems , certainly nothing as modern as Linux - which is what this site runs .
All these guys have going for them is bandwidth , and that 's not particularly bad - and once the client blocks those IPs and notifies the relevant ISPs , it wo n't be an issue at all .
In fact , there are analysis and response utilities that can track this sort of thing and do it automatically , and I 'll recommend them to the client .
Here - "
- " ... shall we ?
I have a Paglia e Fieno con Pollo e Funghi that should only take a few minutes to finish preparing , a tiramisu made to my own recipe for desert , and a really great ' 97 Rosso di Cerbaiona wine that should go well with it all .
My girlfriend , the lovely Priority Interrupt , is going to join us . "
- " Nonsense , Frink ; we 'd love your company . "
After dinner , Frink lounged in the big armchair and Priority curled up in Woomert 's lap and lit a huge Toscano cigar , which she used to produce beautuful double and sometimes triple rings of smoke .
At Woomert 's inquiring glance , she reached up and placed the cigar between his lips .
Frink grinned at the two of them across the room .
perl - wlne ' / ^( \S+ ) /;$h{$1}++}{$a=@a=values%h;map{$b+=$_}@a;print$b/$a ' access.log
/^( \S+ ) /

$ h{ $ 1} + +
At Woomert 's encouraging nod and smile , Frink went on .
%h
Next ... um .
Next , there 's a closing brace all by itself ... and I do n't understandand what it does - or even why the code works .
Should n't that fail with a syntax error ? "
" Normally , it would .
However - go ahead and pull up `` perldoc perlrun '' again , and take a look at the entry for ` - p ' :
# From ``perldoc perlrun ''
while ( <> ) {
... # your program goes here
} continue {
print or die " - p destination : $!
" ;
}
Frink concentrated on the code .
Suddenly , his face lit up .
END{}
All right , since we have that , the rest is n't too tough .
Let 's see :
$ a=@a=values % h ;
All right , you extract the list of values - all the counts - from the hash and set `$a ' to the number of values returned ; that 's what you get when you look at a list in a scalar context ( it 's a bit more complex than that , but that 's the part that 's important right now . )
Next , you sum up all those values -
map{$b+=$_}@a ;
print$b/ $a
you print out the ratio of that sum over the count of the elements - thus dividing the total hits by the number of IPs .
How 's that ? "
- " Thank you , thank you ...
I guess spending all that time studying under Woomert 's direction is starting to pay off - thanks , Woomert !
The rest of them are somewhat similar :
perl - wlne ' / ^( \S+ ) /;$ h { $ 1} ++}{ print" $ h{$ _}\t$_" for sort{$h{ $a}<=> $h{$b}}keys %h ' access.log
The first part we already know - do a frequency count of the IPs .
In the end block , however , you do something different ; we 'll parse it right to left , just as Woomert taught me :
sort{$h{$a}<=> $h{$ b}}keys%h
for ( values %h ) { ... }
sort
perldoc -f sort
$a
$ b
sort
print " $ h{ $ _}\t $ " for ...
for
$ _
$ h{$_}
Last but not least , we have this :
perl - lne ' /^( \S+ ) .*? " (.*? ) " /; length$h{$1}>length$2or$h{$ 1}=$2}{print" @a" while@a=each%h ' access.log
/^( \S+ ) .*? " (.*? ) " /
Woomert lazily extracted a laser pointer from his shirt pocket and pointed .
length$h {$ 1}>length $ 2or$h {$ 1}=$
2
@a
perldoc perllexwarn
$ 2
or
or
||
Can you do the rest ? "
- " Yes ; it looks fairly easy .
print " @a" while@a=each%h
I 've seen you do this before ... oh yes .
It 's a `` while each '' loop that retrieves a key - value pair from a hash ; you 're assigning them to an array and printing the array .
Since you 've interpolated it by using double quotes around the array name , you 'll get a space between the elements - which makes it nicely readable .
All together , this prints out our hash - in more - or - less random order , but we do n't really care since we just want to see what 's in it .
Right ? "
- " I ... I hope so , Woomert . "
Frink looked up , proud as can be .
" I believe so .
I 'll certainly do my best .
I 'll head off for home then , and leave you two alone .
Have a great night . "
- " You 've made Frink 's week , you know .
That 's quite a compliment . "
