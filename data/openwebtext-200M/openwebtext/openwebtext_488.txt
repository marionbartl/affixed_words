The life of the street artist is , by necessity , one of anonymity .
In many of the world ’s cities , the most noticeable and breathtaking pieces of art are n’t created by world - renowned talents .
They are created by the unknown street artist under cover of darkness .
We never see them and they are known only by their tagging pseudonyms .
This is part one of our complete eight - part guide to Banksy Art and Graffiti ..
UK - based street artist Banksy is a notable half - exception to this rule .
His work is currently seen around the planet .
There are few in the art world ( street or otherwise ) who do n’t know his signature style .
The exception , though , is that no one is sure just who he is .
There have been many claims to know his true identity but none have ever been definitive to date .
Who is Banksy ?
We may not know his real name , but his art is unmistakably the work of a passionate individual .
So what do we know about Banksy ?
His paintings , stencils , and other art pieces frequently address serious social issues .
He takes on capitalism , war , poverty , and governments with grace .
His work often displays a keen sense of humor , making it equally possible that you will laugh or cast your eyes down thoughtfully upon seeing a Banksy piece .
And although the pseudonym and the signature style of the artist are well known , there ’s not much else that we know for sure about Banksy .
A few tidbits of information are widely accepted : he is from Bristol , UK , and got involved in graffiti art sometime in the early 90s .
He began to gain widespread notoriety around 2003 .
He was born in or around 1974 and sports a silver tooth .
He is , according to the few people who have met him as Banksy , an unassuming and typical - looking man .
His refusal to be interviewed in person or even to reveal his real name has added to his mystique over the years .
In the UK ( and , increasingly , in other parts of the world )
Banksy - spotters claim to know the artist ’s real identity on a fairly regular basis .
Although he ’s been caught on CCTV a few times , he is clever enough to keep his identity a mystery .
There is good reason for leaving us guessing about Banksy .
Banksy ’s work has been equated with vandalism on several occasions , and many have called for his prosecution .
His choice of subject matter coupled with his medium ( typically spray paint on public walls ) ruffles feathers no matter where he is ( or who he is ) .
Banksy ’s talents are n’t limited to paint and the occasional pencil drawing .
He has been responsible for a number of social commentaries involving replacing hundreds of Paris Hilton CDs with CDs of his own creation .
He has sneaked his own work into several art museums , including a prehistoric - looking piece at the British Museum which the museum decided to add to their own permanent collection .
Just as controversial as his methods is Banksy ’s take on the art world at large .
He has been known to deride other artists for their self - importance and “ inferior ” art forms .
He has even taken on the people who buy his art .
Following a 2006
Sotheby ’s auction of several of his works , he produced an illustration of an auction on his official website featuring the words “ I ca n’t believe you morons actually buy this shit . ”
He is a vocal opponent of the organized art world , though he now produces some work that is more conventional than his street art roots .
Banksy ’s work is applauded by many , but some critics say that it oversimplifies issues to appeal to the masses .
Other critics – most notably , representatives from Keep Britain Tidy – believe that Banksy ’s street art is a crime and that he is setting a negative example for other would - be graffiti artists .
Through his talent and his dedication to art and his personal statements , Banksy has become perhaps the most famous anonymous artist ever .
We still do n’t know his true identity or where he will pop up next , but just mentioning his pseudonym brings a look of recognition to the faces of anyone who knows anything about art .
Love him or hate him , Banksy is without a doubt one of the most influential artists working today .
He has affected the art world from Australia to the US and nearly everywhere in between .
Over the next few weeks , we ’ll take a closer look at Banksy ’s work , his influence , and the grand mystery surrounding everything he does .
Since CNN bothered to make James Burgett one of its heroes ( an honor he richly deserves ) why not maintain the video that says so ?
Why does a video have to “ expire ” ?
For that matter why should the rest of the CNN links on that story , other than the one to the ACCRC , go to expired or 404 ’d CNN locations ?
Bulletin to CNN : I ’d gladly pay to see that video ( or after seeing it ) .
But on my terms , not yours .

In a recent story we highlighted that Reyk Floeter ( reyk@ ) had asked for an Asus EeePC in order to improve support for newer ath ( 4 ) chips .
Reyk since received two EeePC donations and has been hard at work improving at h ( 4 ) .
While doing so he encountered some issues with these computers , here is his follow up story ...
When I fixed support for a number of newer ath ( 4 ) variants , I asked for an EeePC donation to work on the currently unsupported wireless chipset that is integrated in most of these mini-laptops .
Just about one week later I got two donations - an EeePC 701 and an EeePC 900 .
And I had more donation offers from other users , I really appreciate your support !
It will need some time to fix the wireless support , but it also helps to work on various other issues that we see on these machines : interrupt routing ( with help from kettenis@ ) , camera support ( with help from mglocker@ ) , ACPI ( with help from marco@ ) and I also want to improve the lii( 4 ) driver ( to be fair , lii was written by the author without documentation since it is a chipset that is now owned by Atheros ) .
Please read on for the rest of the story ...
Both EeePCs require ACPI to work correctly , but for some reason the BIOS still provides APM .
ACPI is not enabled by the kernel if APM is detected , so you need to manually disable the apm ( 4 ) device to get ACPI on boot .
The EeePC 701 can be installed with the normal installation sets , but the EeePC 900 is a little bit trickier ; I decided to write a short guide on installing the 900 until we found a way to fix it in the default OpenBSD installer .
Create a multi processor ( MP ) version of bsd.rd on another i386 OpenBSD build machine .
The EeePC 900 is a single core machine , but the MP kernel also enables IOAPICs and a slightly different interrupt handling .
# cd /usr / src/sys/arch/i386/conf
# sed " s/ ^apm0.*/apm0 at bios0 disabled / " RAMDISK_CD > RAMDISK_CD.eeepc # sed " s/GENERIC/RAMDISK_CD.eeepc/ "
GENERIC.MP > RAMDISK_CD # cd /usr / src/distrib/ special / libstubs
&& \ make obj && make depend && make all && make install # cd /usr / src / distrib / crunch && \ make obj && make depend && make all && make install # cd /usr / src/ distrib / i386 / ramdisk_cd && \ make obj && make depend && make all
Create a bootable USB stick ( sd1 in this example ) : # fdisk - i sd1 # disklabel - E sd1 > a a ( use the defaults ) > w > q # newfs rsd1a # mount / dev/sd1a / mnt # cp /usr/mdec/boot /mnt/boot # /usr/mdec/installboot -v /mnt/boot /usr/mdec/biosboot sd1 # cp /usr/src/distrib/i386/ramdisk_cd/obj/bsd.rd /mnt/bsd # umount / mnt
Install the EeePC900 : insert the USB stick and press ESC on boot to get the EeePC BIOS boot dialog .
Select the USB device and continue ...
In the OpenBSD installation make sure to select " bsd.mp " as well .
After installation , make sure to boot bsd.mp with apm ( 4 ) disabled boot > boot bsd.mp -c ... UKC > disable apm UKC > quit
Store the bsd.mp settings for the next reboots ( if you do n't want to compile your own modified kernel ) : eeepc900 # config - ef / bsd.mp > disable apm > quit eeepc900 # echo set image bsd.mp >
/etc/boot.conf

Pentagon plans more spy satellite purchases Associated Press
Published : Tuesday July 1 , 2008

The Pentagon will buy and operate one or two commercial imagery satellites and plans to design and build another with more sophisticated spying capabilities , according to government and private industry officials .
The satellites could spy on enemy troop movements , spot construction at suspected nuclear sites and alert commanders to new militant training camps .
The Broad Area Surveillance Intelligence Capability ( BASIC ) satellite system will cost between $ 2 billion and $ 4 billion .
It would add to the secret constellation of satellites that now circle the Earth , producing still images that are pieced together into one large mosaic .
A single satellite can visit one spot on Earth twice every day .
BASIC 's additional satellites will allow the photos to be updated more often , alerting U.S. government users to potential trouble , humanitarian crises or natural disasters like floods .
The announcement of the BASIC program , expected this week , has been delayed for months , with Pentagon , Air Force , and National Reconnaissance Office officials fighting over who should be in charge of buying , building and operating the satellites .
They have also debated whose needs the system will cater to : senior military commanders or policymakers in Washington , D.C.
At stake was not just money but power : billion - dollar budgets are up for grabs , and the agencies ' traditional missions and way of doing business have been hanging in the balance .
The National Reconnaissance Office ultimately won the right to buy and operate the satellites , besting the Air Force .
And military commanders ' needs trumped the White House .
They will , for the first time , have the power to dictate what satellites will photograph when they pass overhead .
The concept is known as " assured tasking . "
" The battlefield today is so dynamic the warfighter needs to be able to respond at a moment 's notice .
Knowing they have the opportunity to have assured tasking in the next pass of satellite becomes very critical and helpful in the planning of their operations , " Josh Hartman , the Pentagon director for space and intelligence capability acquisition , told The Associated Press .
Military commanders have long desired that kind of tasking control .
Now , they submit their requests to a national intelligence authority which prioritizes the missions .
And sometimes those requests are delayed or rejected .
The new satellite system is meant to bridge what intelligence agencies fear will become a huge gap caused by cancellation in September 2005 of a major component of the Future Imagery Architecture system overseen by the National Reconnaissance Office .
Prime contractor The Boeing Co. , headquartered in Chicago , ran into technical problems developing the satellite and spent nearly $ 10 billion , blowing its budget by $ 3 billion to $ 5 billion before the Pentagon pulled the plug , according to industry experts and government reports .
The Pentagon now hopes BASIC will fill in some of the lost capabilities .
- First , it will increase the amount of imagery the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency buys from commercial satellite companies GeoEye , of Dulles , Va. , and DigitalGlobe , of Longmont , Col. , which are expected to put four new satellites into orbit by 2013 .
The U.S. military now has a $ 1 billion contract with two commercial satellite companies to buy space imagery .
A U.S. commercial satellite launched in September by DigitalGlobe can make out the outline of 20 - inch object from space .
This year , GeoEye is launching a satellite with the ability to see the outlines of a 16 - inch object .
By 2011 , that capability is expected to sharpen to nearly 10 inches .
Secret government imagery satellites are believed by experts to have better than six - inch resolution .
- Second , the National Reconnaissance Office will buy , launch and operate one or two commercial imagery satellites with 16 - inch resolution , probably around 2014 .
A solicitation for proposals will be issued shortly .
- Third , NRO will design and build another more advanced satellite to be launched in 2018 .
The capability of that satellite , known as Block II , will be defined later .
Underpinning this will be the creation of a new ground intelligence station that will not only download the imagery directly from the satellites and make it available to all users , but will also - in theory - allow the users to tap into the national intelligence database that holds imagery produced by all spy equipment and sources such as satellites , aircraft and ground sensors .
The Pentagon 's plan to both buy commercial satellite imagery and operate similar satellites of its own is an attempt to balance two competing goals .
National space policy requires the Pentagon to buy as much commercial imagery as possible to help the companies withstand competition from subsidized foreign satellite companies .
At the same time the Pentagon does not want to give the companies so much business that they tailor their services to government needs and ignore the private sector they need to make them self - supporting .
The Pentagon satellites will also be a back - up capability in case future commercial satellites malfunction .
The nation 's classified network of satellites represents some of the most expensive government programs and receives almost no public oversight .
Because of their multibillion - dollar price tags , sensitive missions and lengthy development schedules , spy agencies go to great pains to keep details from becoming public .
But if history is an indicator , the price tag could climb much higher as the new satellite is built .
The House and Senate intelligence committees have criticized the Pentagon and intelligence agencies ' management of space programs .
Half the programs have experienced cost growth of 50 percent or more .
The Defense Department spends about $ 20 billion annually on space programs .
@ Ulquiorra Schiffer :
But that 's the thing , I do n't consider Oblivion 's " scale " to be any major accomplishment .
On a whole , it was one small set of content , copy + pasted several times so that it could fill several square miles of game world .
The dungeons all looked the same , the environments were all identical save for a little snow in the north .
Size of a gameworld means nothing when every part of that world is populated by the same thing .
All Bethesda did was make enough content for one area , and multiplied it until it filled a larger space .
Even that small amount of content that they had , to me , felt broken and unpolished .
Other games at the time may not have been as large as Oblivion , but what they did have was polished and functional and fun to play .
I 'd rather have 10 hours of solid , coherent gameplay than 100 hours of copy + pasted quests and broken combat .
Houston ( TGW ) – BroadStar Wind Systems has unveiled its “ next generation ” wind turbine in Houston .
According to BroadStar , the turbine produces 250 kW for $ 250,000 , which would break the $ 1 a watt barrier .
The company spent four years researching and patenting the product , and is in talks to place the product with two different Fortune 100 companies .
The parallel rotor blades of the AeroCam wind turbine make it look significantly different from conventional turbines , and according to BroadStar , significantly cheaper .
The design is also more 30 % smaller than conventional turbines , and therefore can be discretely enclosed in a less obtrusive way .
The AeroCam has a horizontal axis with multiple blades , giving it the appearance of a water wheel .
The major innovation in the design , however , is the ability to automatically and interactively adjust the pitch or angle of attack of the aerodynamic blades as the turbine rotates , thereby optimizing its performance for much the same reasons a bird changes the shape of its wing in flight .
Also , because AeroCam is smaller and sits on the ground , it takes up much less space than would a conventional turbine .
The company says that they are probably 6 months away from production .

An advertisement for the " Grand Theft Auto 4 " video game is seen on the side of a phone booth in New York 's Times Square April 28 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Mike Segar
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) -
The publisher of the controversial “ Grand Theft Auto 4 ” video game sued the Chicago Transit Authority on Monday , accusing it of pulling ads promoting the blockbuster without explanation .
The video game ’s publisher Take - Two Interactive Software Inc. sued the transit authority in Manhattan federal court for violating its free speech and contractual rights , saying it pulled its posters within days of the ads first appearing on April 22 .
Take
Two accused the authority and its sales agent , Titan Outdoor LLC , of violating a $ 300,000 ( 150,000 pounds ) ad campaign agreement that included running “ Grand Theft Auto 4 ” poster ads on the sides of buses and transit display spaces throughout the Chicago transit system scheduled for six weeks between April and June .
The suit seeks an order for the transit authority to run the ads as well as monetary damages of at least $ 300,000 .
The advertisements were removed following a report by a Fox News affiliate that questioned why the ad was allowed to run after a wave of violent crimes in Chicago , the suit said .
Past “ Grand Theft Auto ” games have been criticized for depicting violence including beatings , carjackings , drive - by shootings , drunk driving and prostitution .
Representatives of the Chicago Transit Authority were not immediately available for comment .
The men who committed the atrocities of September 11 were certainly not ' cowards , ' as they were repeatedly described in the Western media , nor were they lunatics in any ordinary sense .
They were men of faith - perfect faith , as it turns out - and this , it must finally be acknowledged , is a terrible thing to be .
Faith , in the religious sense of the word , refers to maintaining belief in something for which there is insufficient evidence to justify holding the belief .
Were we to have sufficient evidence to support the belief , there would be no need for faith .
In fact , there would not be room for faith to be relevant in such a scenario .
But when we want to believe something for reasons other than because the evidence warrants our doing so , faith enters the equation .
And yet , none of this explains why faith is commonly regarded as a virtue , a form of strength , and something for which individuals are praised .
In this post , I 'd like to explore the " virtuous " nature of faith and see how we nonbelievers can better understand it .
The Unlikely Hero
Doing something which others regard as easy seldom brings admiration , respect , or reward .
If I were to tell you that I , as a reasonably intelligent and physically able adult , can tie my own shoes , it is unlikely that you would be too impressed .
You might be somewhat more impressed if I told you that I was a young child .
But you 'd likely be far more impressed if I told you that I had been raised by wolves until age 4 and had sustained serious brain damage , leading many doctors to abandon hope that I would survive at all .
We tend to reserve our deepest admiration for those who have overcome the odds to accomplish great things .
You have all read the books , seen the movies , and watched the TV shows depicting underdogs triumphing in this way .
This is ingrained in our collective consciousness .
The unlikely hero is the one from whom nobody expects success .
He or she must overcome the challenges and limitations to succeed in spite of the overwhelming odds against him or her .
We like to identify with the unlikely hero .
We are thrilled when David beats Goliath , finding it far more appealing than the other way around .
Overcoming Obstacles Through Faith
There is an important and extremely common variant on the theme of the unlikely hero which involves religious faith .
It is so common as to be cliche in entertainment media .
The hero always begins as a skeptic .
Sometimes the hero is some sort of scientist , usually depicted as being overly cold , analytic , and rigid in his or her thinking .
But most of the time the hero is one who walked away from religion after a traumatic experience leading to a loss of faith .
That 's not to say that the hero is necessarily presented as an atheist .
After all , the producers of such programing probably want the audience to be able to relate to their hero rather than despise him or her .
The arc of the story involves exposing the hero to increasing trials and insurmountable obstacles .
At the darkest hour when things appear their bleakest , the hero finds religion , adopts or rediscovers faith , and ultimately triumphs .
Undoubtedly , some of these tales are intentionally designed to push religious belief ; however , this is not the only reason they are popular .
They tap into our shared obsession with the unlikely hero and offer a more cerebral alternative to the physically challenged hero .
We can all relate because we have all had transformative experiences through learning , changing our minds , being exposed to new experiences , etc .
Faith fits this bill perfectly because it is commonly regarded as the most transformative sort of belief one can have .
How Faith Became Virtuous
From an evolutionary - developmental perspective , it makes sense that faith would be encouraged .
In many ways , unwavering trust of the primary caregiver is adaptive for young children .
This sort of faith ( i.e. , complete trust on the caregiver regardless of whether it is warranted ) helps to create a bond and facilitates survival .
As we move beyond the parent - child bond , we see religious belief conferring many benefits early in human history .
It provided a means of grouping beyond the family structure , the appearance of shared morality , comfort , explanations for what are now recognized ( at least by the reality - based community ) as natural phenomena .
Raising children in early faith traditions was likely accomplished through indoctrination rather than education .
We see this even today in fundamentalist communities .
Asking questions was discouraged , as faith was not to be challenged .
Those who maintained steady faith in the face of challenges were rewarded and admired .
They became teaching models , and the lesson grew to include the notion that true faith requires challenge and perseverance .
As we enter the modern era , we find that faith is inextricably associated with challenge , hardship , and despair .
We hear about the " trials and tribulations " of the faithful , and the message is quite clear : faith is difficult .
But is faith really that difficult for those subjected to religious indoctrination ?
And why is faith still considered a virtue today when it seems to provide so little of value in our modern world ?
On the Difficulty of Faith
In examining some of the cultural factors which establish a context within which faith is considered a virtue , we have seen that respect and admiration are often bestowed on the individual who endures great hardships and overcomes the odds to eventually triumph .
But is faith really so difficult to maintain in our modern world that it can stimulate our unlikely hero archetype ?
If so , how does this necessarily make faith virtuous today ?
Even if it proves to be difficult , we must still determine whether it offers something of value in our modern world .
In one important way , maintaining religious faith in today 's world is extremely difficult .
At least , it should be extremely difficult .
After all , there is not one shred of evidence which suggests that anything like the various gods exists .
Science has proven valuable again and again , while religion occupies an intellectual wasteland of willful denial of reality in exchange for superstition and myth .
Surely , the believer must expend considerable energy to keep reality at bay !
One who does so well is doing something that certainly appears difficult ( if not delusional ) .
But before we conclude that maintaining faith is difficult enough to warrant some level of respect , we must consider two additional factors .
First , believers have done a skillful job of setting up the objects of their faith to make faith easier .
Second , believers hold the majority position , at least in the U.S. , removing much of the social pressure that would otherwise challenge their faith .
Faith requires a lack of evidence , and the purveyors of faith have been remarkably effective at defining and redefining their gods so as to make it unlikely that any supportive evidence will ever emerge .
While we in the reality - based community may be correct in our assertion that this renders the god concept logically incoherent , unlikely , or simply absurd , we cannot deny that the believers have done an excellent job of setting up an environment where faith can thrive .
When science advances or reality encroaches , believers redefine their dogma .
The gaps are maintained , and believers are helped to remain faithful .
Moreover , the widespread Christian privilege in the U.S. has made it far less likely that Christian believers will encounter many obstacles to their faith .
In a nutshell , Christian privilege means that the influence and elevated status of Christianity in the U.S. are so pervasive as to be nearly invisible .
Christianity , to a large degree , is the unquestioned norm .
In sum , we can say that maintaining Christian faith is not particularly difficult in the U.S. , at least nowhere near as difficult as it should be .
The Desirability of Faith in the Modern World
Challenges of maintaining it aside , it is exceeding difficult to argue that faith is desirable in the modern world .
In no other sphere of life do we encourage people to believe things in the absence of evidence .
To make a case that religion is different and deserving of this practice is not an easy task .
In fact , it soon becomes rather obvious that the religious faith of today centers on believing what one wants to believe no matter what the data suggest .
It is a form of prideful ignorance in which human desire is elevated above reason , often with disastrous consequences .
Faith gives people a " get out of thinking free card " which they often use to end conversations much like a child throwing a tantrum .
Because it is considered inappropriate in U.S. culture to criticize or even question someone 's faith , the faithful can attribute any belief , statement , or action to their faith and often get away with it .
In the unlikely event that someone does question them , screaming persecution often works .
Faith gives people an excuse for claiming real or manufactured change and soliciting forgiveness for past wrongs .
It matters little whether the change is genuine - if the individual claims faith , all is forgiven by many believers .
Summary
I see little about faith that can rightly be called virtuous .
It is not particularly difficult to maintain in a culture that encourages it and when it is focused on the sort of belief system constantly revised to facilitate it .
Nor is it beneficial in the modern world .
In fact , the high costs outweigh any benefits by a wide margin .
Solutions to the problem of faith are not easy , but this does not make them any less necessary .
As Richard Dawkins wrote in The God Delusion :
Christianity , just as much as Islam , teaches children that unquestioned faith is a virtue .
You do n't have to make the case for what you believe .
If somebody announces that it is part of his faith , the rest of society , whether of the same faith , or another , or of none , is obliged , by ingrained custom , to " respect " it without question ; respect it until the day it manifests itself in a horrible massacre like the destruction of the World Trade Center , or the London or Madrid bombings .
Then there is a great chorus of disownings , as clerics and " community leaders " ( who elected them , by the way ? ) line up to explain that this extremism is a perversion of the " true " faith .
But how can there be a perversion of faith , if faith , lacking objective justification , does n't have any demonstrable standard to pervert ?

June 24 , 2008  --
A former top official in the White House 's faith - based office was awarded a lucrative Department of Justice grant under pressure from two senior Bush administration appointees , according to current and former DOJ staff members and a review of internal DOJ documents and emails .
The $ 1.2 million grant was jointly awarded to a consulting firm run by Lisa Trevino Cummins who previously headed Hispanic outreach efforts for the White House Office of Faith - Based and Community Initiatives , and a California evangelical group , Victory Outreach .
The grant was awarded over the strong objections of career DOJ staff who did not believe that Victory Outreach was qualified for the grant and that too great an amount of the funds was going to Cummins ' consulting company instead of being spent on services for children .
Cummins ' company , Urban Strategies LLC , was slated to get one third of the money for helping the self - described " evangelizing " Victory Outreach use the rest of the funds .
On its website , Victory Outreach describes itself as a " church - oriented Christian ministry called to the task of evangelizing and disciplining the hurting people of the world , with the message of hope and plan of Jesus Christ . "
The grant is now central to a Justice Department probe into alleged irregular contracting practices within its own ranks , according to a federal law enforcement official close to the investigation .
The money was awarded by J. Robert Flores , the Administrator of the DOJ's Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention ( OJJDP ) who is under investigation by the DOJ's Inspector General after current and former employees said he awarded grants to programs with the right political and ideological connections .
OJJDP grants are intended to address juvenile delinquency prevention and / or the juvenile justice system .
Questions about Flores ' awarding of grants were raised earlier this month by ABC News on Nightline .
Cummins ' application for the grant should have immediately " raised red flags , " according to a senior Justice Department official .
The official said that most of the grant money should be going to services , but that " in this case , you have a third of the money up front going to a consulting company , " the official said .
Furthermore , Cummins ' said in the application that she planned to have one of her senior employees oversee Victory Outreach 's use of the federal funds , even though that employee , Kelly Cowles , had mismanaged funds according to Ohio state investigators .
The proposal said that Cowles was qualified because as president of her own consulting company she had designed and implemented " a two - year statewide $ 22 million " faith - based initiative for the Ohio Governor 's Office .
Ohio's governor terminated that contract for mismanagement in March 2007 .
An investigation by the Ohio Inspector General in September 2007 questioned more than $ 125,000 in payments to Cowles ' firm , concluding that " there was no documentation of what work was performed , services provided , or actual days worked . "
Cowles ' company filed for bankruptcy protection in June of that year .
Cowles declined to comment to ABC News for this story .
Flores awarded the $ 1.2 million OJJDP grant around that same time despite the findings of the Ohio State Inspector General and the objections of career Justice Department grant reviewers .
The reviewers concluded that Cummins ' proposal was poorly crafted and labeled it as " not recommended " for funding .
They questioned whether the Victory Outreach had either " the capacity " or " sufficient knowledge " to " undertake a project of this magnitude , " according to a DOJ memo .
In the end , Victory Outreach rejected the grant because the group did not believe it was qualified to carry it out .
" Our board decided it was way too big a grant to handle , " said Pastor Tony Garcia , Vice President of Special Services for Victory Outreach .
Garcia said that Victory Outreach became involved with Urban Strategies after other faith - based and evangelical organizations said that the consulting firm had been successful in obtaining federal grants that they would not otherwise have won .
" They were highly effective in their work for other ministries , " he said .
The Victory Outreach grant is one of several awarded by Flores that have come under scrutiny .
Six current and former DOJ officials told ABC News that Flores often set aside their recommendations and federal rules and regulations to award such grants to further Bush administration policies such as supporting faith - based organizations and sexual abstinence , and to reward political allies of the administration .
In the case of the Victory Outreach grant , Steven McFarland , the director of the Justice Department 's Task Force for Faith - Based and Community Initiatives , was involved with Cummins ' firm being considered for federal grants , internal DOJ emails show .
On March 16 , 2007 , McFarland emailed Flores ' Chief of Staff , Michele DeKonty , to encourage her to meet with Cummins , saying that he had just had a meeting with Cummins that morning .
In the email he " recommended that [ Cummins ] contact [ DeKonty ] regarding Victory Outreach , a faith - based ministry with 40 years of work among gang members . "
McFarland also pointed out that Cummins was formerly with the White House Office of Faith - Based and Community Initiatives , adding " I know you will find her a great asset to [ your ] work . "
An OJJDP official said that McFarland often encouraged the department to fund faith - based programs .
" McFarland has his fingers in a lot of what gets funded .
The program officers see him as the voice of the White House as communicated from Main Justice , " the DOJ employee told ABC News .
Erik Ablin , a DOJ spokesman said on behalf of McFarland that " the Justice Department 's Task Force for Faith - Based and Community Initiatives provides assistance to faith - and community - based organizations in identifying funding opportunities within the Federal government for which they are eligible to apply .
The Task Force does not make the decisions about which groups are funded , " he said .
Cummins told ABC
News she did not recall meeting McFarland at all during the time she was attempting to obtain the OJJDP grant , and was unaware that McFarland had played any role in assisting her to obtain it .
At a House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform probing Flores ' grant awarding policies , Flores asserted that he had broad discretion to overrule his career staff 's recommendations as to which grants should be funded : " While some may disagree with my decisions they were made in accordance with the law , within department rules , and in good faith to address the needs of our children . "
The answer to this question is a good indicator of how much control standardized time has over your life .
For me , I would say the longest I go would be a few hours at most ( or 7 - 8 hours if I ’m sleeping , which does n’t count ) .
One of my nastiest and most unattractively annoying habits is my constant surveillance of the time .
I even find myself subconsciously reaching into my pocket to check the time on my cell phone — and half the time , I do n’t even remember what it is after I put my phone away !
I think its some kind of bizarre ingrained obsessive - compulsive tic .
Since I started my new job ( some details mentioned in the previous post ) , I ’ve noticed that keeping track of the time has become even more important to me .
Because it takes me so long to get home from NYC , I only have an hour or two to enjoy for myself at the end of each day .
However , when I should be using these periods to concentrate on meaningful pursuits and the things that make me happy , I often find myself distracted by constant glances at the clock to see how much time I have left .
Definitely not good !
It seems as if I ca n’t enjoy my time if I know I do n’t have a lot of it .
When the minutes start to run down , I get cranky and irritated .
The more I think about it , the more I ’m realizing how harmful and strange this habit is … but hey , that ’s what this blog is for .
If you ’re in a similar situation , I want you to try an experiment with me .
Tomorrow , I ’m going to keep my cell phone turned off for the entire day , and I ’m going to place a piece of electrical tape over the clock on my Windows taskbar .
I ’m going to try and make it the entire day without looking at the clock more than 5 times ( seems reasonable , considering I look at it 50 + times under my current routine ) .
I think it will be interesting to see how changing this daily habit affects me .
I ’m expecting good things .
I urge you to join me , and share your experiences in the comments section .
How long do you ever go without knowing what time it is ?
Homo sapiens ’s environment of evolutionary adaptedness ( a.k.a. EEA or “ ancestral environment ” ) consisted of hunter - gatherer bands of at most 200 people , with no writing .
All inherited knowledge was passed down by speech and memory .
In a world like that , all background knowledge is universal knowledge .
All information not strictly private is public , period .
In the ancestral environment , you were unlikely to end up more than one inferential step away from anyone else .
When you discover a new oasis , you do n’t have to explain to your fellow tribe members what an oasis is , or why it ’s a good idea to drink water , or how to walk .
Only you know where the oasis lies ; this is private knowledge .
But everyone has the background to understand your description of the oasis , the concepts needed to think about water ; this is universal knowledge .
When you explain things in an ancestral environment , you almost never have to explain your concepts .
At most you have to explain one new concept , not two or more simultaneously .
In the ancestral environment there were no abstract disciplines with vast bodies of carefully gathered evidence generalized into elegant theories transmitted by written books whose conclusions are a hundred inferential steps removed from universally shared background premises .
In the ancestral environment , anyone who says something with no obvious support is a liar or an idiot .
You ’re not likely to think , “ Hey , maybe this person has well - supported background knowledge that no one in my band has even heard of , ” because it was a reliable invariant of the ancestral environment that this did n’t happen .
Conversely , if you say something blatantly obvious and the other person does n’t see it , they ’re the idiot , or they ’re being deliberately obstinate to annoy you .
And to top it off , if someone says something with no obvious support and expects you to believe it — acting all indignant when you do n’t — then they must be crazy .
Combined with the illusion of transparency and self - anchoring ( the tendency to model other minds as though the were slightly modified versions of oneself ) , I think this explains a lot about the legendary difficulty most scientists have in communicating with a lay audience — or even communicating with scientists from other disciplines .
When I observe failures of explanation , I usually see the explainer taking one step back , when they need to take two or more steps back .
Or listeners assume that things should be visible in one step , when they take two or more steps to explain .
Both sides act as if they expect very short inferential distances from universal knowledge to any new knowledge .
A biologist , speaking to a physicist , can justify evolution by saying it is the simplest explanation .
But not everyone on Earth has been inculcated with that legendary history of science , from Newton to Einstein , which invests the phrase “ simplest explanation ” with its awesome import : a Word of Power , spoken at the birth of theories and carved on their tombstones .
To someone else , “ But it ’s the simplest explanation ! ” may sound like an interesting but hardly knockdown argument ; it does n’t feel like all that powerful a tool for comprehending office politics or fixing a broken car .
Obviously the biologist is infatuated with their own ideas , too arrogant to be open to alternative explanations which sound just as plausible .
( If it sounds plausible to me , it should sound plausible to any sane member of my band . )
And from the biologist ’s perspective , they can understand how evolution might sound a little odd at first — but when someone rejects evolution even after the biologist explains that it ’s the simplest explanation , well , it ’s clear that nonscientists are just idiots and there ’s no point in talking to them .
A clear argument has to lay out an inferential pathway , starting from what the audience already knows or accepts .
If you do n’t recurse far enough , you ’re just talking to yourself .
If at any point you make a statement without obvious justification in arguments you ’ve previously supported , the audience just thinks you ’re crazy .
This also happens when you allow yourself to be seen visibly attaching greater weight to an argument than is justified in the eyes of the audience at that time .
For example , talking as if you think “ simpler explanation ” is a knockdown argument for evolution ( which it is ) , rather than a sorta - interesting idea ( which it sounds like to someone who has n’t been raised to revere Occam ’s Razor ) .
Oh , and you ’d better not drop any hints that you think you ’re working a dozen inferential steps away from what the audience knows , or that you think you have special background knowledge not available to them .
The audience does n’t know anything about an evolutionary - psychological argument for a cognitive bias to underestimate inferential distances leading to traffic jams in communication .
They ’ll just think you ’re condescending .
And if you think you can explain the concept of “ systematically underestimated inferential distances ” briefly , in just a few words , I ’ve got some sad news for you . . .

Leon Trotsky
The Anarcho - Syndicalist Prejudices Again !
( May 1923 )
COMRADE
Louzon ’s latest article contains even more errors than his earlier articles , though this time his main line of argument takes an entirely different turn .
In his earlier articles , Comrade Louzon ’s starting points were abstractions which assumed that the trade unions represented the “ working class as a whole ! ”
In my reply I put the question : “ Where does Comrade Louzon write his articles – in France or on Sirius ? ”
In his latest article Comrade Louzon deserts the shaky foundation of universal laws and attempts to stand upon the national ground of French syndicalism .
Yes , he says , the French trade unions are not actually the working class as a whole , but only the active minority of the working class .
That is , Comrade Louzon acknowledges that the trade unions form a sort of revolutionary party .
But this syndicalist party is distinguished by being purely proletarian in it constituents ; here lies its tremendous advantage over the Communist Party .
And it has still another advantage : the syndicalist party categorically rejects the bourgeois state institutions ; it does not “ recognise democracy , and thus takes no part in the parliamentary struggles .
Comrade Louzon never tires of repeating that we are dealing with the peculiarities of French development and with these only .
Beginning with a broad generalisation , in the course of which he transformed Marx into a syndicalist Louzon now sets England , Russia , and Germany apart .
He does not reply to our question on why he himself belongs to the Communist International , in company with the small English Communist Party , and not to the Second International , in company with the English trade unions and the English Labour Party which is supported by them .
Louzon began with a “ supra - historical law for all countries , and closes by claiming an exceptional law for France .
In this new form Louzon ’s theory bears a purely national character .
More than this , its essential character excludes the possibility of an International :
How can common tactics be spoken of unless there are common fundamental premises ?
It is certainly very difficult to understand why Comrade Louzon belongs to the Communist International .
It is no less difficult to understand why he belongs to the French Communist Party , since there exists another party possessing all the advantages of the Communist and none of its drawbacks .
But though Comrade Louzon leaves international ground for the sake of national , he systematically ignores that “ national ” question put to him in our former article :
What about the role played by the CGT during the war ?
The role played by Jouhaux was by no means less treacherous and despicable than that played by Renaudel .
The sole difference consisted in the fact that the social patriotic party arranged its views and actions in accordance with a certain system , while the trade union patriots acted purely empirically and veiled their actions in wretched and stupid improvisations .
It may be said that as regards patriotic betrayal , the socialist party , with its definite character , surpassed the semi- definite syndicalist party .
At bottom , Jouhaux was at one with Renaudel .
And how is it today ?
Does Louzon desire the union of the two confederations ?
We desire it .
The International deems it necessary .
We should not be alarmed even if the union were to give Jouhaux the majority .
Naturally we would not say – as does Comrade Louzon – that syndicalism , although headed by Jouhaux , Dumoulin , Merrheim and their like , is the purest form of proletarian organisation , that it embodies “ the working class as a whole , ” etc. , etc. – for such a phrase would be a travesty of the facts .
But we should consider the formation of a larger trade union organisation , that is , the concentration of greater proletarian masses , forming a wider battlefield for the struggle for the ideas and tactics of Communism , to be a greater gain for the cause of revolution .
But for this the first necessity is that the ideas and tactics of Communism do not remain in .
midair , but are organised in the form of a party .
With regard to Comrade Louzon , he does not pursue his thoughts to the end , but his logical conclusion would be the substitution of the party by a trade union organisation of the “ active minority . ”
The inevitable result of this would be a substitute party and substitute trade union , for those trade unions required by Comrade Louzon are too indefinite for the role of a party , and too small for the role of a trade union .
Comrade Louzon ’s arguments to the effect that the trade unions do not want to soil their fingers by contact with the organs of bourgeois democracy , already form a weak echo of anarchism .
It may be assumed that the majority of the workers organised in the CGTU will vote at the elections for the Communist Party ( at least we hope that Comrade Louzon , as a member of the Communist Party , will call upon them to do so ) , while the majority of the members of the yellow confederation will vote for the Blum - Renaudel party .
The trade union , as a form of organisation , is not adapted for parliamentary struggle , but the workers organised in the trade unions will nevertheless have their deputies .
It is simply a case of division of labour on the same class foundation .
Or is it perchance a matter of indifference to the French worker what happens in parliament ?
The workers do not think so .
The trade unions have frequently reacted to the legislative work of parliament and will continue to do so in the future .
And if there are , at the same time , Communist deputies in parliament itself , who work hand in hand with the revolutionary trade unions against the deeds of violence and blows of imperialist “ democracy , ” this is naturally a plus and not a minus .
French “ tradition ” says that deputies are traitors .
But the Communist Party has been called into being for the express purpose of doing away with all tradition .
Should any deputy think of retreating from the class line , he will be thrown out of the party .
Our French party has learned how to do this , and all distrust in it is completely unfounded .
But Louzon complains that the party contains many petty - bourgeois intellectuals .
This is so .
But the Fourth Congress of the Communist International recognised and adopted resolutions on this , and the resolutions have not been without effect .
Further work is required to establish the proletarian character of the party .
But we shall not attain this end with the self - contradictory trade union metaphysics of Comrade Louzon , but rather by means of systematic party work in the sphere of the trade unions , and in every other sphere of proletarian struggle .
‘ Mere is already a considerable number of workers in the Central Committee of our French party .
This is mirrored in the whole party .
The same tendency is at work , in accordance with the resolutions passed by the Fourth Congress , in the parliamentary and municipal elections .
By this the party will win the confidence of the revolutionary proletariat .
And this means that the party will less and less lack really competent and active proletarians to occupy the most important and responsible revolutionary posts .
I greatly fear that Comrade Louzon ’s views may exercise a retarding influence on this profound progressive evolution of the vanguard of the French working class .
But I have no doubt that Communism will succeed in overcoming this obstacle , like all others .

I enjoyed the subtlety of the Guardian 's page 13 layout yesterday .
It was the first page of the international section , and it contained two stories , the first about legal moves in Turkey 's constitutional court to disband the country 's ruling AKP party on the grounds that it is threatening Turkey 's secularist constitution , the second about complaints by Polish holidaymakers who find the nudity on German " free body culture " beaches disgusting .
To the alert eye the connection is direct .
Admirers of the Catholic culture of Poland will assuredly be delighted by its success in making the unclothed human frame an object of disgust .
Admirers of Islamic culture will be delighted to find that Turkish Islamists are encouraging more women to hide that automatic trigger of unbridled male lust , the tresses on the female head .
These are tips of icebergs .
In fact the influence of religious attitudes in distorting and limiting aspects of human life , even to the extent of perverting , imprisoning and poisoning them at the extremes , is too well known to require rehearsal .
It was against the domination of life by religion that Mustapha Kemal Atatürk acted , founding a secular republic which sought to move religion from " the realm of the state to the realm of belief " – which is how Turkey 's current deputy prosecutor , Omer Faruk Eminagaoglu , puts it in explaining the basis of the case against the AKP , which has – even by the admission of some of its own MPs – been conducting a non - too - subtle yet hypocritically disavowed campaign of re-Islamicisation .
The worshippers of Brian 's sandal everywhere are tireless and persistent in their efforts to recapture the world for dogma .
In America the creationists and so - called " intelligent design " votaries expend vast sums and energy on trying to drag us back into medieval times .
Islamists have never left them – except of course in freely using today 's technology to further their aims .
Cherry - pickers all , the Brian - sandalistas want it all : they want the rest of us to think and act as they prescribe , and to make us do it by the means that infidel thinking has produced : for example , religious freakery is all over the internet like a rash .
If the Brian - sandalistas cannot succeed by direct assault , they will do it by constant nibbling and encroachments : prayers in American publicly - funded schools , headscarves in Turkish publicly - funded universities , a little bit of anti-evolutionary biology there , a little alcohol ban there – and if that does n't work , they try more robust means .
So it goes : creep creep , whisper , soothe , murmur a prayer with the kids in assembly , ecumenicalise , interfaith - schmooze , infiltrate , subvert , complain , campaign , scream , threaten , explode .
The asymmetry is stark .
Secularists say , " believe whatever nonsense you want , but keep it to yourself and act responsibly " .
The Brian - sandalistas say , " believe what we want you to believe and act as we say " .
The psychopaths among them say , " believe what we want you to believe and act as we say or we will kill you " .
Meanwhile the residue of attitudes and practices once foisted on everyone by the zealous still dog and bedevil us , as witness the poor benighted Catholic Poles suffering at the sight of what - you have to larf - they presumably believe God created .
There is nothing trivial about the problem in Turkey ; and the problem in Turkey is the problem for the world at large .
It is about boundaries , about the place of religious belief in the public domain , its effects on individual lives , and its effect on public policy .
The history of " the west " is in essence a history of secularisation , and most even of those who decry what they see as its imperfections would not willingly be without the huge advances it has wrought in scientific , social and political respects .
Think : if the clocks could be turned back as the Brians want , the English would be ruled by two people : The Queen and Rowan Williams .
You might be tempted to think that would be an improvement on Gordon Brown and Ed Balls , and preferable to Cameron and his friends from his house at Eton .
But what if , say , Hizb ut - Tahrir got its way – it wants the Caliphate back , and by the logic of its outlook , a worldwide one .
The ambition of the faiths – once they have finished warring with us and each other – is , remember , infinite by definition : and even one mile in the direction of any of their various paradises - on - earth would be a hell for all but those running the journey .
AMID an astonishing surge in food prices , which has sparked riots and unrest in many countries and is making even the relatively affluent citizens of America and Europe feel the pinch , faith in the ability of global markets to fill nearly 7 billion bellies is dwindling .
Given the fear that a new era of chronic shortages may have begun , it is perhaps understandable that the name of Thomas Malthus is in the air .
Yet if his views were indeed now correct , that would defy the experience of the past two centuries .
Malthus first set out his ideas in 1798 in “ An Essay on the Principle of Population ” .
This expounded a tragic twin trajectory for the growth of human populations and the increase of food supply .
Whereas the natural tendency was for populations to grow without end , food supply would run up against the limit of finite land .
As a result , the “ positive checks ” of higher mortality caused by famine , disease and war were necessary to bring the number of people back in line with the capacity to feed them .
In a second edition published in 1803 , Malthus softened his original harsh message by introducing the idea of moral restraint .
Such a “ preventive check ” , operating through the birth rather than the death rate , could provide a way to counter the otherwise inexorable logic of too many mouths chasing too little food .
If couples married late and had fewer children , population growth could be sufficiently arrested for agriculture to cope .
It was the misfortune of Malthus — but the good luck of generations born after him — that he wrote at an historical turning point .
His ideas , especially his later ones , were arguably an accurate description of pre-industrial societies , which teetered on a precarious balance between empty and full stomachs .
But the industrial revolution , which had already begun in Britain , was transforming the long - term outlook for economic growth .
Economies were starting to expand faster than their populations , bringing about a sustained improvement in living standards .
Far from food running out , as Malthus had feared , it became abundant as trade expanded and low - cost agricultural producers like Argentina and Australia joined the world economy .
Reforms based on sound political economy played a vital role , too .
In particular , the abolition of the Corn Laws in 1846 paved the way for British workers to gain from cheap food imports .
Malthus got his demographic as well as his economic predictions wrong .
His assumption that populations would carry on growing in times of plenty turned out to be false .
Starting in Europe , one country after another underwent a “ demographic transformation ” as economic development brought greater prosperity .
Both birth and death rates dropped and population growth eventually started to slow .
The Malthusian heresy re-emerged in the early 1970s , the last time food prices shot up .
Then , at least , there appeared to be some cause for demographic alarm .
Global - population growth had picked up sharply after the second world war because it took time for high birth rates in developing countries to follow down the plunge in infant - mortality rates brought about by modern medicine .
But once again the worries about overpopulation proved mistaken as the “ green revolution ” and further advances in agricultural efficiency boosted food supply .
If the world 's population growth was a false concern four decades ago , when it peaked at 2 % a year , it is even less so now that it has slowed to 1.2 % .
But even though crude demography is not to blame , changing lifestyles arising from rapid economic growth especially in Asia are a new worry .
As the Chinese have become more affluent , they have started to consume more meat , raising the underlying demand for basic food since cattle need more grain to feed than humans .
Neo -Malthusians question whether the world can provide 6.7 billion people ( rising to 9.2 billion by 2050 ) with a Western - style diet .
Once again the gloom is overdone .
There may no longer be virgin lands to be settled and cultivated , as in the 19th century , but there is no reason to believe that agricultural productivity has hit a buffer .
Indeed , one of the main barriers to another “ green revolution ” is unwarranted popular worries about genetically modified foods , which is holding back farm output not just in Europe , but in the developing countries that could use them to boost their exports .
Political folly increases in a geometrical ratio
As so often , governments are making matters worse .
Food - export bans are proliferating .
Although these may produce temporary relief for any one country , the more they spread the tighter global markets become .
Another wrongheaded policy has been America 's subsidy to domestic ethanol production in a bid to reduce dependence on imported oil .
This misconceived attempt to grow more fuel rather than to curb demand is expected to gobble up a third of this year 's maize ( corn ) crop .
Although neo-Malthusianism naturally has much to say about food scarcity , the doctrine emerges more generally as the idea of absolute limits on resources and energy , such as the notion of “ peak oil ” .
Following the earlier scares of the 1970s , oil companies defied the pessimists by finding extra fields , not least since higher prices had spurred new exploration .
But even if oil wells were to run dry , economies can still adapt by finding and exploiting other energy sources .
A new form of Malthusian limit has more recently emerged through the need to constrain greenhouse - gas emissions in order to tackle global warming .
But this too can be overcome by shifting to a low - carbon economy .
As with agriculture , the main difficulty in making the necessary adjustment comes from poor policies , such as governments ' reluctance to impose a carbon tax .
There may be curbs on traditional forms of growth , but there is no limit to human ingenuity .
That is why Malthus remains as wrong today as he was two centuries ago .

A new study may end the century - old controversy over what ingredient in absinthe caused the exotic green aperitif 's supposed mind - altering effects and toxic side - effects when consumed to excess .
In the most comprehensive analysis of old bottles of original absinthe -- once quaffed by the likes of van Gogh , Degas , Toulouse - Lautrec and Picasso to enhance their creativity -- a team of scientists from Europe and the United States have concluded the culprit was plain and simple :
A high alcohol content , rather than thujone , the compound widely believed responsible for absinthe 's effects .
Although consumed diluted with water , absinthe contained about 70 percent alcohol , giving it a 140 - proof wallop .
Most gin , vodka , and whiskey are 80 -- 100 - proof and contain 40 - 50 percent alcohol or ethanol .
Absinthe took on legendary status in late 19th - Century Paris among bohemian artists and writers .
They believed it expanded consciousness with psychedelic effects and called it " the Green Fairy " and " the Green Muse . "
The drink 's popularity spread through Europe and to the United States .
However , illness and violent episodes among drinkers gave absinthe the reputation as a dangerous drug , and it was banned in Europe and elsewhere .
In the new study , Dirk W. Lachenmeier and colleagues point out that scientists know very little about the composition of the original absinthe produced in France before that country banned the drink in 1915 .
Only a single study had analyzed one sample of preban absinthe .
The researchers analyzed 13 samples of preban absinthe from sealed bottles -- " the first time that such a wide ranging analysis of absinthe from the preban era has been attempted , " they say .
The analysis included thujone , widely regarded as the " active " ingredient in absinthe .
" It is certainly at the root of absinthe 's reputation as being more drug than drink , " according to Lachenmeier .
Thujone was blamed for " absinthe madness " and " absinthism , " a collection of symptoms including hallucinations , facial contractions , numbness , and dementia .
However , the study found relatively small concentrations of thujone , amounts less than previously estimated and not sufficient to explain absinthism .
Thujone levels in preban absinthe actually were about the same as those in modern absinthe , produced since 1988 , when the European Union ( EU ) lifted its ban on absinthe production .
Laboratory tests found no other compound that could explain absinthe 's effects .
" All things considered , nothing besides ethanol was found in the absinthes that was able to explain the syndrome of absinthism , " according to Lachenmeier .
He says that scientific data cannot explain preban absinthe 's reputation as a psychedelic substance .
Recent historical research on absinthism concluded that the condition probably was alcoholism , Lachenmeier indicates .
" Today it seems a substantial minority of consumers want these myths to be true , even if there is no empirical evidence that they are , " says Lachenmeier .
" It is hoped that this paper will go some way to refute at least the first of these myths , conclusively demonstrating that the thujone content of a representative selection of preban absinthe ... fell within the modern EU limit . "
The study " Chemical Composition of vintage Preban Absinthe with Special Reference to Thujone , Fenchone , Pinocamphone , Methanol , Copper , and Antimony Concentrations " is scheduled for the May 14 , 2008 issue of the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry .
Group urging FISA ' no ' vote is largest on Obama 's social site Nick Juliano
Published : Thursday July 3 , 2008
Print This Email This Update : Group organizers send open letter requesting Obama help against telco immunity Barack Obama supporters urging the Illinois senator to vote against a pending surveillance law have formed the largest group on the Democratic presidential candidate 's social networking Web site , my.barackobama.com .
The group , " Senator Obama - Please Vote NO on Telecom Immunity - Get FISA Right , " had more than 14,500 members as of Thursday morning .
The group formed last Wednesday , June 25 , making it perhaps the fastest growing user - generated group on the page .
Sometime around 8 p.m. Wednesday , the group became No. 1 in overall membership , surpassing " Action Wire , " the campaign - created group that is designed to fight smears and rumors hurled at Obama .
The " Get FISA Right " group formed in response to Obama 's indication that he would support an update to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Act that is to be voted on in the Senate next week .
Critics say the bill would essentially legalize the National Security Agency 's warrantless wiretapping program , which President Bush authorized , while eliminating pending civil lawsuits aimed at the telecommunications companies that allegedly handed over reams of private customer data to the government .
The group 's founder , blogger Mike Stark , tells RAW STORY he is talking to others who have been active on FISA to determine how best to use the group to pressure Obama and other senators who seem likely to vote for the bill , which is scheduled for a vote on Tuesday .
The group nearly doubled in size over the last two days as it started to receive more attention from progressive bloggers and even garnered a few mentions in more traditional news outlets .
On Thursday , the group released an open letter to Obama asking that the campaign share its phone banking tools so group members can call voters and urge them to pressure their senators to vote against immunity .
The letter also asks Obama to speak out on the Senate floor when the bill is voted on next week .
( The full letter is reproduced below . )
" Senator Obama , the my .
BarackObama.com caption reads , ' I 'm asking you to believe .
Not just in my ability to bring about real change in Washington I 'm asking you to believe in yours , ' " the letter says .
" We 're ready to put these words into practice . "
While the surveillance bill catalyzed the group 's explosive growth , Stark says FISA is not the only issue they will be concerned with .
One way or another , that fight will likely be over within a week , anyway .
" Once the FISA issue is dead , all I have to do is rename the group and I 've still got 15,000 people , " Stark said in a phone interview Thursday .
The Obama campaign did not respond to multiple requests from RAW STORY seeking comment on the group .
An Obama adviser did explain the senator 's shifting position to the New York Times .
Greg Craig , a Washington lawyer who advises the Obama campaign , said Tuesday in an interview that Mr. Obama had decided to support the compromise FISA legislation only after concluding it was the best deal possible .
 This was a deliberative process , and not something that was shooting from the hip ,  Mr. Craig said .
 Obviously , there was an element of whats possible here .
But he concluded that with FISA expiring , that it was better to get a compromise than letting the law expire . 
That excuse , though , relied on an incorrect interpretation of what 's happening , as Timothy B. Lee , a blogger for the libertarian Cato Institute , explains : I feel like a broken record , but FISA , which was enacted in 1978 and updated in 2001 , doesnt expire .
It will remain the law of the land indefinitely , whether or not Congress passes new legislation this month .
The Protect America Act , which was passed last August , has already expired  back in March .
As I pointed out at the time , the expiration of the PAA simply returned us to the permissive surveillance regime that Congress enacted with the Patriot Act in 2001 .
That regime is nt perfect , to be sure , but it leaves our intelligence community with plenty of tools to spy on terrorists .
What Mr. Craig is most likely referring to is the fact that the first surveillance authorizations  under the PAA will begin expiring in August .
These authorizations  are good for a year , so any authorizations approved in August 2007 will expire in August 2008 .
But that simply means that intelligence officials will have to apply for a FISA order under the still fairly permissive Patriot Act rules .
Those rules include a lower legal threshold than exists under ordinary criminal wiretaps , and an emergency  provision allowing wiretapping to begin immediately and authorization to be sought after the fact .
The net result will be a modest increase in the NSAs paperwork burden , but theres no reason to think any reasonable surveillance activities will cease .
( Some indiscriminate vacuum - cleaner surveillance may have to be stopped , but that wouldnt be a bad thing )
Stark said he 's thinking of calling the group " Barack 's Better Angles " and that they would focus on keeping the Democratic candidate committed to the progressive agenda he pushed during the primary , rather than moving to the right as some have seen him doing .
" Progressives win every issue once people understand what the issues are , " Stark said .
" We really do want the change he 's promised . "
The " Get FISA Right " group released this letter it sent to Obama Thursday : Dear Senator Obama , On October 24 , 2007 , your campaign spokesman said , " To be clear : Barack will support a filibuster of any bill that includes retroactive immunity for telecommunications companies . "
On June 20 , 2008 you said , of retroactive immunity , " I will work in the Senate to remove this provision so that we can seek full accountability for past offenses . "
As the largest grass - roots group on your campaign website , my .
BarackObama.com , and in the spirit of your open / responsive government campaign pledges , we wish to share our ideas for how we may work together to further the goal of eliminating retroactive immunity from the FISA legislation scheduled for debate in the Senate next week .
Although this is only one of the problems we see with legislation allows the government to wiretap the communications of its citizenry without a warrant , it 's the area we think we can help you the most .
First , Senator Obama , we ask that you make the same tools that we used to call undecided voters in Iowa and New Hampshire available for us to call our fellow citizens in West Virginia , Nebraska , Delaware , Florida and other states that have Senators committed to voting against the amendment that would strip telecom immunity .
You have the tools and we have the people power .
Together , we are confident we can bring Change ; we can make the government listen to the people instead of the telecom lobbyists .
Second , Senator Obama , we ask that you attend the Senate debate and schedule floor time to speak about the violence done to the rule of law when Congress retroactively immunizes the illegal conduct of a special interest .
We know you understand that justice should not be sold to the highest special interest bidder ; we also know that you can persuade other Senators that are not so clear on the issue .
Of course , if you do this , our committed members will surely capture the video of your inspiring oratory , load it to YouTube and spread your words to our friends and family far and wide .
We trust in your ability to bring a new way of doing business to Washington and look forward to helping you make that Change a reality .
Senator Obama , the my .BarackObama.com caption reads , " I 'm asking you to believe .
Not just in my ability to bring about real change in Washington I 'm asking you to believe in yours . "
We 're ready to put these words into practice .
Thank you .
The 15,000 + ( and rapidly growing ) members of " Senator Obama  Please Vote NO on Telecom Immunity  Get FISA Right "

So I got my very first Arduino in the mail two nights ago .
In less than one day , I was able to create a simple program and circuit that plays back any set of musical notes I want .
I can then modify pitch , frequency and delay time all with potentiometers I have rigged up to the Arduino .
Coding is extremely easy , so it did n’t take long to modify some free code found on the ‘ net .
In the above video , I ’m demoing the unit on my kitchen table with a 9V battery as a standalone unit .
This means that if I ditched the breadboard and connected everything for good via solder , the device would run self - sufficiently .
Anyways , I will post a HOWTO this weekend if there ’s any interest in making your own chiptune maker .
You ’ll need a USB Arduino , some potentiometers , wiring , resistors , a speaker and a breadboard .
Some LEDs would n’t hurt either .
Experiment and see what you can come up with !
If you check Gmail 's settings , the last option under the " General " tab lets you " always use https " when accessing Gmail .
It 's a fairly new option , and it might sound strange ; is n't Gmail secured by SSL ( Secure Socket Layer ) by default ( hence switching to " https://gmail.com " when you type in " gmail.com " in your browser ) ?
The answer is : yes and no .
Once you log in , Gmail reverts back to an unencrypted connection , since SSL connections are slower than regular ones .
This means that whatever you do on Gmail is unencrypted from now on , and someone sniffing traffic on your network can easily obtain sensitive data .
Of course , not everyone has the skills to do that , so the chances of it actually happening are pretty small .
Or , better put , they were small until now .
As reported by Hacking Truths , a tool has been presented at DEFCON that makes stealing session IDs from Gmail a relatively easy affair .
And once someone has your session ID , he / she can log in to your Gmail account without authentication .
In practice , this means that not having the " always use https " option checked , especially if you 're accessing Gmail through a wireless hotspot , or any other unsecure network , has become a hazard , and is not recommended .
Google has been fairly silent about this , letting users decide what they want to do , but I 've switched to SSL and I recommend you do , too , especially if you use Gmail for business purposes .

Guest blogged by Jon Ponder , Pensito Review .
We reported earlier that a report from the Department of Justice Inspector General confirmed that Monica Goodling , the political hack installed by the GOP at the department , had in fact used an applicant 's status as a " loyal Bushie " as a litmus test for DOJ employment .
Now comes confirmation of a rumor reported on NPR in April that the DOJ IG was also pursuing charges that Goodling had fired a US Attorney because Goodling suspected the woman was gay :
In the second of a series of reports on the politically charged tenure of former Atty .
Gen. Alberto R. Gonzales , the department 's inspector general found that two former Justice aides used sexual orientation as a litmus test in deciding whom they would hire or fire .
The report describes an alleged " sexual relationship " between a career prosecutor and a U.S. attorney , who were not named .
Margaret M. Chiara , the former U.S. attorney in Grand Rapids , Mich. , said in an interview with The Times that she now believed she was fired because of the erroneous belief that she was having a relationship with career prosecutor Leslie Hagen .
" I could not begin to understand how I found myself sharing the misfortune of my former colleagues , " Chiara said of the eight other U.S. attorneys who were fired .
" Now I understand . "
Justice officials said after her firing that Chiara was let go because of mismanagement and because she had caused morale in her office to sink .
Chiara said Monday she believed those concerns were raised by the same people who spread rumors about her and Hagen .
" I guess now I am persuaded with deep regret that this is what was the basis , " she added .
" There is nothing else . "
The investigators found that Hagen lost a coveted assignment in Washington after rumors of the supposed relationship reached Gonzales aide Monica M. Goodling .
And :
Monday 's report also said that Goodling used an Internet search that included the words " gay " and " homosexual " to screen candidates and their backgrounds .
Investigators found that Goodling used the same search parameters as Jan Williams , who served as White House liaison before Goodling .
The report said that Williams had used the string in late 2005 and early 2006 to research candidates for positions on a national advisory commission on violence against women .
Goodling , a graduate of a college operated by televangelist Pat Robertson , was also found to have nixed the hiring of a terrorism expert because his wife was a Democrat .
McCain says “ human rights ” imbue at conception .
That ’s interesting , so you mean civil rights laws should be retroactive to birth ?
Of course , McCain does n’t believe in any civil rights for gay people , though he ’s willing to take their sex money for at least a few days until the heat go to be too much .
In any case , it ’s pretty clear that McCain is pandering here .
I do n’t think McCain gives a damn about abortion either way , that ’s why he said he ’d consider a pro-choice VP .
He just does n’t care , regardless of what he says on pretty much any issue other than defense .
And that should trouble people .
It ’s exactly what happened with the first Bush presidency – he cared about foreign policy , and that was it .
And we all suffered as a result .

Posted on June 25 , 2008 , Jonathan Connecticut Senator Searching for “ Rape Scene ” in GTA IV
Anyone who ’s played GTA IV remembers that infamous rape scene in the game , which allowed to accumulate points and …what ’s that ?
You …you do n’t remember that ?
Oooooh , that ’s right , because there was n’t one .
Well , try explaining that to Connecticut Senator , Gayle Slossberg ( D ) .
She ’s apparently convinced that the rape scene is there , she just has to get far enough along in the game to access it .
At a press conference last week , she stated a law requiring clearer warning labels was needed to curb the corruption of youth .
She does n’t seem to know quite what the labels should read though , considering this statement on them :
“ I mean what would it say ?
‘ This game will make you a sociopath ’ ? ”
Yeah , they really need to label those games better to make sure parents know about all the wild and crazy scenarios that are n’t actually in the game itself .
Like how in Pokemon Snap , Pikachu would sometimes sell you drugs in exchange for sexual favors .
That got you bonus points from Professor Oak , as I recall .

For my new computer I bought a ATI HD 2600 PRO with a bunch of memory .
This card has some really good 3D results , and works well on Linux .
But I run into some issues with de xv extension on this board .
In fact the driver ( the free or binary one ) does n’t seems to support sync on vblank .
So when a app try do display datas on the screen , some image destructions appear .
This mainly occurs when I ’m watching videos but in 3D games too .
This is a really stupid bug or mis-feature .
How can a serious video programmer can do that ?
After a couple of month , I decided it was enough , I was sick of this dirty stripes on screen .
I tested every ATI driver one after one … ( ATI opensource drivers have too bad performances to be used on a every days desktop , could you live without google - earth ? ) .. so I decided to go to other side , and bought a Nvidia 8600 GT from ASUS .
This card perform quite as the ATI in 3D , and have a affordable price .
So I switched from ATI to Nvidia .
ATI offers better opensource support , but Nvidia binary driver is really nice to use and have better support today from stuffs like Compiz and Co.. and NO MORE STRIPES !! :)
A couple of weeks ago , I upgraded my Ubuntu Gusty to Hardy .
Everything was Ok , since I played with firefox .
Some heavy loaded pages ( like Amazon , or Gmail ) was damn sloowwwww !
Playing with scroll was a source …… grrrrrr ….
Firefox on Hardy is 3.0b5 .
This version has a major “ feature ” the use a Xrender for the page display .
And this looks like Xrender is dawn slow on Nvidia cards ..
In fact , Nvidia has already work on this kind of issue before .
Without looking forward I decided to run a little benchmark , with the help of friends with Xrenderbenchmark .
So here the results .
Benchmarks
Benchmarks was done by me and 2 firends , on Q6600 or E6600 Intel CPU running at 2.4Gh , with kernel 2.6.24.1 .
The graphs only show the Plain results ( not Plains + Alpha , or Transformation ) but the results are quite the same anyways .
Legend :
8600GT/nv : Nividia 8600GT / Xorg 1.4.1git 32 bits / Nvidia GPL driver
8600 GT / nvidia : Nividia 8600GT / Xorg 1.4.1git 32 bits / Nvidia binary driver ver : 169.12
8600GT / nividia-64 : Nvidia 8600GT / Xorg 1.4.1 git 64 bits / Nvidia binary driver ver : 169.12
Intel GMA X300 : Intel GMA 3000 / Xorg 1.4.0.9 64 bits / Intel GPL driver
ATI HD2600 PRO : ATI HD 2600 Pro / Xorg 1.4.1 git 64 bits / ATI GPL driver
I split the results into two graphs for convenience .
As you can see on this first part , numbers are really small , the Nvidia GPL driver is the worst : 5 times slower than any other one .
Not a good news , and the binary one have some bad results on 2 tests .
ATI HD and Nvidia drivers offer quite the same results , but remenber this is the GPL ATI driver ! …
The Intel does n’t have a lot of linearity on this part .
But the next graph give us absolutely different picture !
For every graph , Nvidia drivers ( GPL , or binary , 32 or 64 bits ) are at least 6 time slower .
Intel perform very well , no surprise , this card are damn cool , perfect driver for linux .. but to slow in 3D to really rock .
And ATI GPL driver is the clear winner of this benchmarks tests .
As my issue is the Nvidia one , I can comment the results , the GPL driver performs better than the binary one .
This is not a big surprise cause , I can see it in Firefox , even it ’s slow .
There is difference between 64 bits and 32 , but I guess this is more kernel related than the driver itself .
I ’m not a video guru and only do that figure out what ’s going on my computer .
I publish in the hope it might help somebody else , and to find help .
Update :
The numbers can be found here
Thanks to Ludo and Christian for their help !
Important update : Check the new driver results !!

Work on the new I - 35W bridge began almost immediately after the old bridge collapsed into the Mississippi River near downtown Minneapolis .
The fatal collapse of a bridge in Minneapolis a year ago jolted states into better inspections of the nation 's 600,000 bridges , but they are n't coming up with the billions of dollars needed to ensure that all of them are sound .
The plunge that killed 13 people when the span crumpled into the Mississippi River on Aug. 1 was " a wake - up call " to take care of aging bridges , says Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell .
" We ca n't wait for another Minneapolis . "
Since the tragedy , Pennsylvania has approved $ 350 million in bonds to repair 411 bridges .
Road tolls will go up next year .
It would cost $ 9.4 billion a year for 20 years to eliminate all bridge deficiencies in the USA , according to the latest estimate , made in 2005 , by the American Society of Civil Engineers .
CHART : State - by - state update on bridge conditions , funds CHALLENGE : Bridge - work needs outweigh funds in Pa .
A USA TODAY review found that beefed - up inspections since the collapse led 16 states to close bridges , reduce weight limits or make immediate repairs .
All states inspected bridges designed like the one that fell .
Some , including Arizona , Delaware , Louisiana , Maine , Minnesota , New Jersey , New York and Tennessee , conducted broader reviews to identify bridges needing the most work .
South Carolina and Wisconsin are installing high - tech sensors that record the deterioration of a bridge , which inspectors can track on the Internet .
Arkansas is training assistant building inspectors to team with bridge inspectors so there are two sets of trained eyes at an inspection .
Twelve percent of the nation 's bridges are structurally deficient , according to the Federal Highway Administration , meaning they are not unsafe but are so deteriorated that they must be closely monitored and inspected or repaired .
That percentage has crept down .
In 1997 , it was 15 % .
States are fixing bridges that are in the worst shape , but long - term repairs and upkeep will still suffer unless funding increases , says Kent Harries , a University of Pittsburgh engineering professor .
" We will see more bridge collapses , " says Harries , who specializes in bridge engineering .
Colorado has identified 125 major bridges in need of replacement or major repair at a cost of $ 1.4 billion .
Funding for repairs , though , fell from $ 32 million in 2007 to $ 18 million in 2009 .
States are facing cuts in federal funding next year because of a projected $ 3.2 billion shortfall in the Highway Trust Fund .
The gap is expected to grow because Americans are driving less .
Thursday , the House of Representatives sent to the Senate a bill that would give states $ 1 billion in emergency funds for bridge repair .
States are looking for other financing .
Nine are issuing bonds — taking on debt — raising taxes , hiking fees or shifting funds from other road projects .
New Jersey is moving funds from other road projects in order to spend $ 605 million on bridge repairs this year , up $ 96 million from last year .
Minnesota is raising its gas tax and phasing in a surcharge to pay for $ 6.6 billion in bonds for road and bridge projects over 10 years .
The money " goes a long way to help us , " says Tom Sorel , commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Transportation .
" We 've gone through a lot . "

In a landmark and impromptu interview today on the Alex Jones Show , music icon and genuine American hero Willie Nelson addressed the impending attack against Iran and Dennis Kucinich ’s article of impeachment , scheduled to go before the House Judiciary Committee on Friday .
Calling in from a music tour venue in Council Bluff , Iowa , Willie stated that George Bush and his neocon minions cannot be allowed to get away with fraudulently invading Iraq and engaging in mass murder without “ even a slap on the wrist . ”
Impeachment , according to Nelson , is a “ minor way ” to deal with crimes of such a horrific magnitude .
However , supporting Kucinich ’s brave and tenacious effort in the House of Representatives “ might slow the guy down ” in regard to the planned invasion of Iran , tentatively set for either September or October , according to numerous insiders and experts .
Willie admitted he does not know if it is too late to stop the drive toward confrontation with Iran .
If the attack manages to go forward he warned “ America will not be the same America ” and the country will be “ in for some tough times , ” including the distinct possibility of an economic depression and the imposition of martial law .
It is imperative that we turn the country around , Willie averred , and once again “ set ourselves up as peacemakers , ” not as arbiters of endless war , mass murder , and engineered chaos .
It is time to get off the path Bush and his neocon puppet masters have steered the nation down over the last seven and a half years .
In addition , we must deal decisively with the “ guys pulling the strings ” and not allow them to simply “ throw George under the bus ” and escape justice .
It is important that Dennis Kucinich “ keep hitting them on the sore spot ” and eventually set the stage to bring every last criminal neocon to justice .
Success in this effort depends to a large degree upon circumventing the corporate media .
In regard to the events of September 11 , 2001 , Nelson said it does not take a “ German scientist to realize we were hit by some inside people ” on that day and it will take dedication and more concerted activism to eventually bring the perpetrators to justice .
Earlier this year , Willie went on the Alex Jones Show and declared his belief the WTC and Building 7 were imploded like a “ casino in Las Vegas ” brought down by demolition .
“ They ’re trying to tell me that an airplane did it and I ca n’t go along with that , ” Nelson told Jones and his audience on February 4 .
Finally , in response to a caller from Arizona , who mentioned Willie ’s Live Aid and Farm Aid concerts , Nelson indicated he would be interested in volunteering to participate in a 9/11 truth , anti-war , and impeachment concert event .
Such an event would “ give the people a venue ” and a “ chance to stand up ” against the government .
After the interview , Alex discussed the issue off - air with Willie and it was decided the details for such an event would be worked out in the next few days and the event would take place in either New York or Austin , Texas .

Comment on this article
Jonathan Barnes ( Paris ) , Myles Burnyeat ( emeritus , Oxford ) , Raymond Geuss ( Cambridge ) , and Barry Stroud ( Berkeley ) answer the questions here .
The questions and answers vary quite a bit in their interest and depth ( Geuss is appropriately short and dismissive of some of the questions ) .
A few excerpts .
Geuss , in response to a question about whether it is a loss that few philosophers now write in the form of dialogues , poems , aphorisms or the like any longer :
Academic philosophers should not give themselves too much importance .
People are not going to stop expressing philosophical views in letters , or dialogues , or aphorisms just because this will not get them employment in a department of philosophy .
Stroud on whether only those with training can do philosophy :
I think of philosophy as a difficult intellectual endeavour .
You have to learn how to do it , and it takes a lot of practice .
Only those who know how to do it are really engaged in philosophy .
It is possible to do serious philosophy outside an academic institution ( many of the great philosophers of the past did it ) .
But nowadays it is virtually impossible to earn a living and support oneself outside an academic institution while doing philosophy .
Barnes embarrasses himself mightily with this bizarre proclamation :
[ M]ost philosophers who belong to the so - called analytical tradition are pretty poor philosophers .
( Most academics who do anything are pretty poor at doing it ; and philosophy , or so it seems to me , is a subject in which it is peculiarly difficult to do decent stuff .
A modestly competent historian may produce a modestly good history book ; a modestly competent philosopher has no reason to publish his modest thoughts . )
But there 's a big difference between the analyticals and the continentals : what distinguishes the continental tradition is that all its members are pretty hopeless at philosophy .
Myself , I 've read scarcely a hundred continental pages .
I can't see how any rational being could bear to read more ; and the only question which the continental tradition raises is sociological or psychological :
How are so many apparently intelligent young people charmed into taking the twaddle seriously ?
Having read " a hundred continental pages " ( whatever exactly that means ) , Barnes dismisses as worthless two hundred years of philosophy since Kant on the European Continent , including multiple traditions ( Idealism , Marxism , existentialism , phenomenology , etc. ) encompassing tens of thousands of pages of canonical texts !
Barnes , at least , claims elsewhere in the interview not to be a philosopher , but an historian of philosophy , which means that this disgraceful display of parochial ignorance can not be attributed to " analytic philosophy . "
With regard to the question that provokes Barnes 's outburst -- regarding the " analytic / Continental divide , " Geuss has a better and more apt answer :
Whether " analytic " / " continental " is an illuminating or well - formed dichotomy is less important than the general recognition that for as long as there have been philosophers , they have always disagreed with one another radically on a wide variety of important issues .
In this they differ from scientists or mathematicians .
Lack of consensus , if not active intellectual hostility , is the natural state for any body of philosophers .
This seems to be a fact of life about the way humans respond to certain basic features of the human condition , and it seems more reasonable to accept this and try to understand why it is the case and what its implications might be than to try to fit philosophy into a mould derived from religion ( the universal consensus of all orthodox believers ) or from a certain conception of " strict science " ( all biologists agree that the whale is a mammal , not a fish ) .
Which is to say that the best way to approach embarrassing displays of ignorance like Jonathan Barnes 's would be through psychology , not philosophy !
Comcast has 30 days to disclose the details of its " unreasonable network management practices " to the Federal Communications Commission , the agency warned Wednesday morning as it released its full , 67 - page Order .
As FCC Chair Kevin Martin said it would , the Commission 's Order rejects the ISP giant 's insistence that its handling of peer - to - peer applications was necessary .
" We conclude that the company 's discriminatory and arbitrary practice unduly squelches the dynamic benefits of an open and accessible Internet , " the agency declares .
In addition , the company 's " failure " to publicly reveal its true practices has " compounded the harm , " the Commission says .
Beyond the 30 - day deadline , Comcast must send the FCC a plan explaining how it will mend its ways by the end of the year , and do so by then .
It must also disclose what the company 's new network management system will look like .
Today 's Order is the follow - up document to the FCC 's three - to - two decision against Comcast , announced on August 1 .
Although the Commission clearly throws the book at Comcast regarding P2P throttling , and warns the company that noncompliance will have legal consequences , the agency issues no fine against the ISP .
And at least one public interest group says the FCC has given the company too much time to change .
But there is a radical aspect to this document , which aligns the Republican - led Commission with the net neutrality movement .
" We invite Free Press [ a complainant in the case ] and other members of the public to keep a watchful eye on Comcast as it carries out this relief , " the Commission concludes .
" Using the information provided by Comcast , pursuant to this Order , as well as information submitted by the public , we will closely monitor the company 's network management practices . "
History of denial
The FCC's Order summarily rejects Comcast 's version of the last year of this controversy , particularly its insistence that at present the ISP only interferes with peer - to - peer uploads during periods of heavy traffic .
Comcast repeatedly " changed its story " regarding its practices as the volume of complaints rose through last fall , the Commission charges .
First its spokesperson insisted that the company does not " throttle any traffic , " the FCC says .
Then , when an Associated Press study concluded that Comcast " actively interferes " with BitTorrent applications , the ISP insisted that it only inserts RST [ reset ] packets into P2P streams " during periods of heavy traffic . "
But when consumers sent the FCC data reporting P2P interference through long periods of time , Comcast acknowledged that " current P2P management is triggered ... regardless of the level of overall network congestion ... and regardless of the time of day . "
We can stop this
The FCC Order also asserts that the agency has the authority to take these actions against Comcast .
It invokes its 2005 Internet Policy Statement as a set of instructions to Internet access service providers , produced by the Commission as directed by Congress .
The statement declares that consumers are " entitled to run applications and use services of their choice . "
The document also warns ISPs that should the FCC identify violations of this principle , the agency " will not hesitate to take action to address their conduct . "
The FCC rejects Comcast 's insistence that it does not have the authority to take these steps .
The Commission notes that while the Supreme Court 's Brand X decision classified cable ISPs as " information services " rather than " telecommunications services , " it added that the FCC " has jurisdiction to impose additional regulatory obligations " on ISPs via its interstate commerce powers .
In addition , the agency argues that the Telecommunications Act of 1996 requires the FCC to promote competition in telecommunications and broadcasting .
Today 's
Order does n't come right out and charge that Comcast , a cable video provider , sought to block P2P use to squelch competitors .
But the document rather strongly implies it , and insists that the Commission has a statutory duty to combat such behavior .
" If cable companies such as Comcast are barred from inhibiting consumer access to high - definition on - line video content , " the FCC says , " consumers with cable modem service will have available a source of video programming ( much of it free ) that could rapidly become an alternative to cable television . "
Trust but verify
Today 's decision offers few lines of sympathy for Comcast .
It does acknowledge that the company has promised to set up a " protocol agnostic " ISP system by the end of the year ( Ars guesses that the agnosticism comes from a telecom industry - wide allergy to the word " neutral " ) .
Beyond that , the document invokes Ronald Reagan 's famous dictum : " trust but verify . "
Comcast must :
Reveal the " precise contours " of its network management practices , including the types of equipment used , when they came into use , how they were configured , and where they have been deployed .
Come up with a compliance plan complete with benchmarks that explains how Comcast will move " from discriminatory to nondiscriminatory network management practices by the end of the year . "
Publicly disclose the details of its new practices , " including the thresholds that will trigger any limits on customers ' access to bandwidth . "
If Comcast does not comply with these three requirements , the company will face a temporary injunction and then a permanent cease - and - desist order from the FCC .
" Our overriding aim here is to end Comcast 's use of unreasonable network practices , " the Order declares , " and our remedy sends the unmistakable message that Comcast 's conduct must stop . "
Reactions
It is widely expected that Comcast will challenge this decision in court , but the company is being circumspect today with the press .
" As you can imagine , we 'll need to review the order , " Comcast spokesperson Charlie Douglas told Ars , " so all we can say right now is ' We are examining the order and evaluating our options ' . "
Needless to say , Free Press and co-complainant Public Knowledge are quite happy about the decision .
" This clear legal precedent signals that the future of the Net Neutrality debate will be over how , not whether , to protect users ' right to unfettered Internet access , " Ben Scott , policy director of Free Press , declared .
Harold Feld of the Media Access Project also praised the move , but told Ars that he finds " one flaw " in the decision : giving Comcast a month to come up with a compliance plan , followed by a year - end deadline to " stop blocking its own customers . "
" While we should certainly celebrate today 's Order , " Feld said , " no one should declare ' mission accomplished ' until Comcast 's BitTorrent blocking stops for good . "

PARTISAN HISTORY : A FRESHMAN'S PERSPECTIVE :
After 34 years of college teaching , I thought I had heard just about every imaginable student complaint .
Last week , however , a freshman in my 300 - seat US History Since 1865 course came in to discuss her exam with one of the graders and proceeded to work herself into a semi-hissy over the fact that we had spent four class periods ( one of them consisting of a visit from Taylor Branch ) discussing the civil rights movement .
The waters of Lake Nyos , Cameroon , turned a murky brown following a deadly release of toxic gas in August 1986 .
Photo : Thierry Orban / Corbis Sygma View Slideshow __1986 : __A deadly cloud of carbon dioxide sweeps down the slopes of an African volcano , smothering more than 1,700 people .
Volcanoes can kill in many ways , but this one is pretty weird .
A volcanic lake in the West African nation of Cameroon degassed violently ( you could say it burped , or worse ) in the middle of the night .
Carbon dioxide is odorless and heavier than air .
Most of the victims died in their sleep .
Lake Nyos sits in the crater of a volcano that had n't erupted in centuries ... and probably did n't actually erupt the night of Aug. 21 , 1986 .
Magma deep underneath the lake releases carbon dioxide into its depths .
Lake Nyos is 690 - feet deep , enough for the water pressure to keep the CO2 dissolved in the lake water , rather than letting it bubble up and escape to the surface .
And the crater rim towers above the lake , blocking winds which could otherwise stir the surface and create convection currents that would circulate the deep , CO2 - saturated water upward to areas of lower pressure .
The lack of seasonal variation less than seven degrees north of the equator also contributes to the lake 's placidity .
Volcanic rumbling or other seismic activity could have triggered the sudden release of the gas that deadly night , but there 's no record of any tremors and no evidence that anything shook off the shelves of homes in nearby villages .
It 's possible the gas at the lake 's bottom just got so concentrated that even under pressure it came out of solution and formed bubbles .
Once the bubbles started rising , a " chimney effect " would have rapidly siphoned huge amounts of gas to the surface .
The gas burst through the surface with a rumble , generating a giant wave that scoured vegetation from the shores .
The CO2 cloud was at least 300 - feet high , because it suffocated cattle on hillsides that far above lake level .
Iron from the deep water oxidized and stained the lake waters with rust .
Then the gas crept down the mountain valleys , invading homes .
It extinguished oil lamps and suffocated people in their sleep .
Some who were awakened by the loud gas bubble stood up and lived , because their heads were above the invisible gas near the ground .
But many who went outside paid with their lives .
Few survived .
Those from neighboring villages who discovered the devastation recalled with terror the legends about evil demons living in mountain lakes .
Had this happened before ?
Yes , at least on a smaller scale .
A CO2 cloud released by Lake Monoun , about 60 miles south , killed 37 people two years earlier .
( The much larger Lake Kivu – on the Congo - Rwanda border – harbors not only carbon dioxide , but methane , in its depths . )
And Cameroonians frequently find frogs suffocated by CO2 in low - lying mud puddles .
Engineers hope to prevent a recurrence of the tragedy by continuously degassing Lake Nyos .
They 've sunk a pipe from a floating platform into the depths of the lake .
It shoots a geyser of carbonated water high into the air .

Click above for a high - res gallery of the Chevrolet Volt concept .
One of the many things General Motors boasted about when it unveiled the Volt concept at the Detroit Auto Show in 2007 was its 600 - mile range .
This was achieved partially by the battery pack , which could sustain a ( theoretical ) charge allowing the Volt to run for 40 miles without reverting to the gasoline engine / generator , as well as a 12 - gallon fuel tank .
According to Kicking Tires , GM has shrunk the size of the tank by an unknown quantity and the result is a reduction in range from 600 to 400 miles – or 360 miles without the aid of auxiliary ( read : grid- provided ) power .
The General maintains that since most owners do n't travel more than 40 miles in one day , it was n't necessary to fit the Volt with a larger tank .
That reduction in capacity will save some weight , but what will it cost in public perception ?
The hype surrounding GM 's supposed savior and game - changer are based on two figures : range and cost .
If GM can deliver on both counts , they might have a hit on their hands .
If not , the Volt will be DOA the day it hits dealers

I looked at Rebol a few years ago , but lost interest pretty quickly .
Recently commenter Edoc recommended it , so I took another look , and remembered why I lost interest last time .
The first problem is that the docs are frustratingly introductory .
Everything I can find is aimed at explaining the language to beginners , with lots of repetition and very little precision .
Would it be so hard to explain the language kernel in a way someone who knows languages can understand ?
The closest I can find to a description of the semantics is the overview of evaluation and one entry in the FAQ .
There are grandiose statements about how different Rebol is from other languages , and how it 's supposed to take over the world , but not much explanation .
Okay , even from the beginner documentation you can learn something .
Rebol is intended for making little DSLs - so , like Lisp , it separates the syntax from the language .
Programs are defined in terms of trees , not text , and the trees are easily available to interpreters .
But Rebol also tries to preserve a familiar appearance of programs - infix , and without too many parentheses .
The usual way to do this is to keep the trees as abstract as practical , and have the parser transform complex syntax into a simple underlying representation .
Rebol does the opposite .
It preserves most of the syntax in its parse trees , so the parser is simple but the interpreter is complicated .
In Rebol , 2 * sin :x reads as a four - element sequence : [ 2 * sin :x ] .
The advantage is that code closely resembles its source text ; the disadvantage is that even parsed code is rather complicated and awkward to operate on .
The parser is not actually all that simple , because Rebol has syntax for a great many data types .
In addition to the four kinds of symbols and three kinds of sequences used for programs , there are a variety of other types with syntax .
The complete list is :
Word ( symbol ; 4 kinds ) : foo : bar : baz ' error-out-of-metasyntactic - variables
Block ( vector ) : [ 1 two [ three ] " IV " ]
Paren ( same as Block , but different eval semantics ) : ( alpha [ beta * gamma ] delta )
Refinement ( generalized field accessor ) : /x
Path ( field access expression ) : a/b/c
Integer : - 55 16'777'216
" Decimal " ( actually binary floating point ; there 's nothing decimal about them ) : 10.0 2,718'281'828'4 6.023E23

Tuple ( of 3 or more small integers ) : 127.0.0.1
Money : EUR$ 0.02 $ 0.03
Pair ( 2 - D point ) : 1024x768
There are only a few types that do n't have syntax :
Logic ( boolean ) : true false yes no on off ( these are constants , not syntax )
( these are constants , not syntax ) None ( nil ) : none ( constant )
( constant ) List
Hash ( hashtable )
Image ( bitmap )
Curiously , much of the syntax is defined by special kinds of tokens rather than with special characters .
It 's not just numbers , but dates , times , and even pairs .
This makes it a bit hard to tell how a token will be parsed , and thus whether an unusual symbol needs to be escaped .
It seems to me that Rebol goes a bit overboard on this .
I 'm not sure why dates or email addresses need to be handled by the parser rather than by the few operations that use them .
The syntactic support is slightly convenient for some small programs , but I have a hard time believing it helps with larger ones .
Of course a language 's semantics are more important than its syntax , and it 's tricky to figure them out from a tutorial .
The obvious alternative is to read the source - but here 's the other reason I stopped looking at Rebol : it 's not open - source .
“ REBOL / Core is free and will always be free ” , says the license page , but they only mean gratis .
Quite frustrating to someone who might understand it by looking at eval , or to anyone considering using the language .
Joe Marshall ( who used to work on Rebol ) apparently wrote a Rebol - to - Scheme compiler , but the actual code seems to have vanished from the face of the Internet .
( Update : Here 's a copy .
Thanks , anonymous ! )
Fortunately , bits of a Rebol interpreter survive in Joe 's talk on the difficulties of doing tail - call optimization .
From these , and from the documentation , I think I understand Rebol 's eval now , though not with enough confidence to explain it formally - go read that talk if you want to know .
The odd thing is that it operates on sequences , so it has to parse as it evaluates .
The two operations which consume arguments ( assignments and function calls ) evaluate as many as they need from the rest of the sequence , not knowing where an expression ends until they 've evaluated it .
( This is why tail - call optimization is hard : you can't tell whether you 're in a tail context until the last moment . )
After evaluating , if there 's nothing left , then you just did a tail call , and its result is the value of the block .
If there is something left , and it begins with an infix operator , then what you just evaluated was its first argument , so you evaluate another argument and call the infix operator .
( This means all infix operators are left - associative . )
This is what it takes to interpret unparenthesised prefix with variable arity , but it 's certainly awkward .
Here 's something disturbing : Rebol 1.0 had lexical scope , but Rebol 2.0 does n't .
Blocks are just self - evaluating , and it's up to functions ( or should I say FEXPRs ? ) like if to evaluate them in some environment .
( However , this article suggests words know something about their environment . )
I do n't know how assignment handles nested scopes .
It is worrying , especially in a poorly specified language with no reference implementation , to see what appears to be a well - known mistake , and the possibility of several others .
I do n't trust my intuition when evaluating a language , but I 'm beginning to get the impression that Rebol has a lot of cute features on a rather shaky foundation .
Trying to reconstruct a language from introductory documentation is a frustrating task , so I 'll stop here .
Unfortunately I 've exhausted my patience before learning much about its library or how it works in practice , so I still do n't know what the good details were that Edoc was talking about .
Maybe some other time .
BAGHDAD , July 28 ( UPI ) -- Suicide bombers in Kirkuk and Baghdad killed 48 people injured 249 others Monday , officials said .
In Kirkuk , a female suicide bomber and gunmen killed 24 people and injured at least 187 others attending a rally to protest an election law passed by the Iraqi parliament but rejected by the country 's presidency council , CNN reported .

During the rally , the bomber detonated the explosive among Kurdish demonstrators and gunmen began firing into the crowd from various positions , police reported .
Kurdish officials blamed the violence on Turkmen minority extremists , and demonstrators responded by torching Turkmen - owned buildings , The New York Times said .
Meanwhile in Baghdad , three female suicide bombers killed at least 24 people and wounded 36 others , the Iraqi Interior Ministry said .
Most were Shiite pilgrims
The bombings in three locations occurred within 30 minutes of each other and targeted Shiite Muslims as they traveled to the Kadhimiya shrine in the north of Baghdad for annual ceremonies , the BBC reported .
The bombers struck as pilgrim convoys passed through the Karrada district .
On Sunday afternoon , seven pilgrims were killed in a town south of Baghdad , CNN reported .

Random number generation
Here is the current list of known random number generation issues / bugs that have been found in previous versions of PyCrypto :
In versions prior to v2.6.1 , Crypto .
Random was insecure when using fork ( ) in some cases .
See the advisory for CVE - 2013 - 1445 for more information .
It is recommended that users upgrade to PyCrypto v2.6.1 or later .
See the advisory for CVE - 2013 - 1445 for more information .
It is recommended that users upgrade to PyCrypto v2.6.1 or later .
In versions prior to v2.1.0 , Crypto.Util.randpool.RandomPool was unsafe as commonly used .
It was not thread - safe or fork - safe at all , and it was not always properly seeded with entropy .
This was by design , but most application developers simply read from it without any further thought , resulting in insecure applications .
See this thread for more information .
It is now is deprecated , and will be removed in a future release ; Use Crypto .
Random or os.urandom instead .
Keeping an entropy pool in a user - space program is complex and error - prone .
It is especially difficult to do reliably in a generic crypto library , and it is quite common for mistakes to be made .
Hopefully , operating systems will one day provide random number generation facilities that are sufficiently fast , trustworthy , and reliable that they can completely replace the multitude of user - space random number generators that currently plague our software .

SINCE time immemorial — or at least as far back as Hippocrates — novice physicians have been taught to smell patients ' breath for signs of illness .
Though unpleasant for the doctor , it is a useful trick .
The sweet smell of rotten apples , for instance , indicates diabetes .
Liver disease , by contrast , often causes the breath to smell fishy .
But the human nose cannot detect all the chemical changes brought about by disease .
Science , therefore , seeks to smell what human doctors cannot .
The aim is to create a diagnostic nose as discriminating as those of perfume mixers or wine buyers .
Such a nose would , however , be sensitive not to life 's pleasures , but to its pains .
The idea of creating a diagnostic nose goes back to the 1970s .
In that decade Linus Pauling , a Nobel - prize - winning chemist , performed the first serious scientific analysis of human breath .
He used a technique called gas chromatography , which enables complex mixtures to be separated into their components , to detect some 250 volatile organic compounds in the air exhaled from lungs .
Gas chromatography by itself , however , does not allow you to identify each component — it is merely a way of separating them .
To make the identifications , you need to add a second step , called mass spectrometry .
This , as its name suggests , works out the weight of the molecules in each component .
Often , weight is enough by itself to identify a molecule .
But if two molecules happen to have the same weight , they can be analysed by breaking them up into smaller , daughter molecules .
These are almost certain to differ in weight .
Using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry , researchers have , over the years , identified more than 3,000 compounds that are regularly exhaled , excreted or exuded from the body .
The search , now , is to understand how changes in the mixture of these compounds may indicate disease , and to find ways of recognising such changes routinely and robustly .
Exhaustive analysis
One of the first practitioners of the field of olfactory diagnosis , Carolyn Willis of Amersham Hospital in Britain , decided to contract the job out to dogs .
They , she reckoned , have the necessary nasal apparatus to sniff out illness , and there was already some anecdotal evidence that they could , indeed , smell people with cancer .
It worked .
For the past four years her sniffer dogs have been diagnosing bladder cancer .
She is now training them to detect prostate cancer and skin cancer as well .
But training dogs is probably not the best solution .
It takes time and needs special skills , so mass - producing sniffer dogs would be hard .
Moreover , a dog can give you only a yes - or - no answer .
It can not describe nuances , even if it detects them .
Boguslaw Buszewski of Nicolaus Copernicus University in Torun , Poland , compares this approach to checking for fever by touching a patient 's forehead .
That tells you he is ill .
However , it is only by measuring his temperature with a thermometer that you can discover how serious his condition is .
In Dr Buszewski's view the breath - analysis equivalent of the thermometer is the mass spectrometer , and that is where effort should be concentrated .
Other researchers agree .
Earlier this month Michelle Gallagher , of the Monell Chemical Senses Centre in Philadelphia , announced the results of a study that uses this approach .
She confirmed that the early stages of basal - cell carcinoma , a type of skin cancer , can be detected by analysing the odour of a person 's skin using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry .
To do so , she sampled the air immediately above the tumours and compared its composition with that of air from the same sites in healthy individuals .
She also checked the composition of the air in the room when nobody was present , as an extra control .
She found that although air collected from both groups contained the same chemical substances , there was a difference in the amounts of some of them .
This finding allowed her to produce what is known as a biomarker profile for the illness .
That means it can be diagnosed reliably and — crucially — early on .
The combination of gas chromatography and mass spectrometry thus works .
It can , nevertheless , take up to two days to run the tests .
Dr Buszewski hopes to refine and speed up the process so that it can be carried out within an hour .
To do this , he has developed a device that can be tuned to pick up and concentrate the most relevant molecules .
With patents still pending , he is cagey about the details , but the principle is to trap relevant molecules using columns made of metal or silica that are the width of a human hair .
Each column is coated with special polymers tweaked so that they bind preferentially to particular compounds found in the breath .
Pass a sample through a forest of these columns and the molecules of interest will be sucked out .
They can then be flushed into the analytical machinery and a result quickly emerges .
Dr Buszewski is now tweaking his device so that it works with the biomarker profiles of a range of diseases .
If he can do this successfully , olfactory diagnosis could become mainstream without a wagging tail in sight .

Devout Roman Catholic and Social Conservative shares his thoughts on his Faith , politics and the world .
This photo of Ashley Alexandra Dupre is from a myspace.com web page and dated January 2008 .
REUTERS/myspace.com
LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - Ashley Alexandra Dupre , the call girl at the center of the Elliot Spitzer sex scandal , watched the potential earnings from her new - found fame drop by $ 1 million on Tuesday as old nude videos of her emerged .
Adult DVD distributor “ Girls Gone Wild ” discovered videos of a semi-nude Dupre , now 22 , in its archives and plans to sell them on its Web site , a company spokesman said .
“ Girls Gone Wild ” had offered to pay Dupre $ 1 million to pose nude in a magazine it plans to launch but , after discovering the old footage , the company withdrew its offer .
Last week , Spitzer resigned as governor of New York after news surfaced he had paid for a sexual encounter in Washington , D.C. The New York Times revealed that Dupre was the prostitute he had hired .
A “ Girls Gone Wild ” video crew met Dupre in Miami in 2003 and she stayed with them for a week shooting videos , the spokesman said .

Back in March , we blogged a Time article written by the creators of " The Wire . "
The piece described the country 's " unwinnable drug war " as having turned from " a battle against dangerous substances " into " a venal war on our underclass . "
As part of an admittedly incomplete solution , the " The Wire " writers called for widespread jury nullification � a practice that they defined as refusing to " collaborate with a government that uses nonviolent drug offenses to fill prisons with its poorest . "

Marcus Aurelius Antoninus was Roman emperor from 161 until his death in 180 .
A great thinker , Marcus embodied Plato ’s ideal of the philosopher king to a considerable extent .
He was a strong emperor , engaging in various wars in defense of the Roman empire for his entire reign , but he was also greatly concerned with social justice and welfare , even going so far as to sell his own possessions to alleviate people ’s suffering from famine and plague ( from which he died ) .
Marcus left behind a corpus of writing which , despite it ’s antiquity , offers us some truly timeless wisdom .
Here are six lessons we can learn from his observations on life .
Lesson # 1 : We Are Responsible for Our Own Experience of Life
“ Such as are your habitual thoughts ; such also will be the character of your mind ; for the soul is dyed by the color of your thoughts . ”
Much has been made recently of the ( so called ) ‘ law of attraction . ’
Before ‘ The Secret , ’ a wealth of writers had tapped into the idea that what happens in our mind is the most important thing in shaping our experience of life .
From Norman Vincent Peal ’s ‘ Amazing Power of Positive Thinking , ’ and Joseph Murphy ’s ‘ Power of the Subconscious Mind ’ to
Wallace Wattles ‘ Science of Getting Rich , ’ all were taking about a truth which Marcus understood so may centuries ago .
Viktor Frankl said that between what happens to us and our response to it , there is a gap , and in that gap lies our whole experience of life .
Steven Covey , in his ‘ Seven Habits ’ called our ability to widen this gap ‘ being proactive . ’
It is the first habit of a highly effective person to cultivate an awareness that s/he is in control .
To coin a phrase , life is what you make it .
Lesson # 2 : Everything Changes
“ Time is a sort of river of passing events , and strong is its current ; no sooner is a thing brought to sight than it is swept by and another takes its place , and this too will be swept away . ”
I keep a sign posted over my desk at work .
It reads ‘ this too will pass . ’
It is a reminder to me that , whatever I am experiencing in life , it will disappear and be replaced with something else .
Only one thing is certain – everything changes .
People who know this and tap into the natural course of change can be very successful .
Let ’s take one area as an example – the stock market .
People who bought stock after the dot com crash , knowing that the market would rebound after such a dramatic fall , reaped enormous rewards .
Those who sold when prices had become stupidly inflated and wildly disconnected from earnings , knowing that the market could n’t keep on rising forever , also did well .
Clinging on to the way things were can be a source of great misery .
The past is gone and it ’s never coming back ; the present is already changing .
So why complain that things used to be better ?
There are opportunities if only we can see that change is coming .
Lesson # 3 : Live a Real Life
“ It is not death that a man should fear , but he should fear never beginning to live . ”
I recently picked up a copy of Felix Dennis ’ book ‘ How to Get Rich ’ while waiting for a flight recently .
It ’s a great read – unlikely to make you rich I suspect , but full of wonderful observations .
In the first chapter , Dennis ( who is ‘ one of the richest self - made men in Britain , according to the back sleeve of the book ) tells us that one of the main obstacles to being rich is comfort – a regular paycheck , a pension , a nice title , stock options .
In other words , people do n’t want to risk losing what they have .
In other words , they are afraid .
They are not living the life they want because they are scared they might lose more than they gain .
In the British comedy ‘ The Office , ’ Tim is set to leave his dead end job and go to university when he is given a small promotion .
This persuades his to stay at work because although , as he puts it , he has ‘ rolled a three and could very well roll a six , ’ going to university might not work out – he might end up ‘ rolling a one . ’
Taking risks is no easy thing , but when we come to the end of it all , shall we regret that we stayed too much in our comfort zone ?
Lesson # 4 : Be Grateful
“ When you arise in the morning , think of what a precious privilege it is to be alive – to breathe , to think , to enjoy , to love . ”
Marcus clearly understood that gratitude is an important commodity to possess .
We take so many things for granted , and only when we lose them do we stop to think just how important they were to us .
If you cannot sleep because you have stomach ache or you have injured yourself , you will quickly become grateful for a good night ’s sleep !
Every day is a gift , and there are so many , many things to be happy about .
We all have problems and we all suffer lack and privation , but why not focus on the good things we have ?
If you can read this , then you have had an education and you are probably rich enough to own a computer and pay for an Internet connection .
Make a list of things you can be grateful for – you might be amazed at how long it is !
Lesson # 5 : Be Detached
“ Receive wealth or prosperity without arrogance ; and be ready to let it go . ”
Felix Dennis , in his book ‘ How to Get Rich , ’ speaks plainly about the real meaning of wealth .
It is nothing , he says .
It is n’t real .
Getting rich , he writes , is just a game .
If we take the pursuit of wealth ( or anything else , for that matter ) too seriously , we are likely to fail .
In the Bhagavad - Gita , Lord Krishna says to Arjuna , ‘ Plunge into the heat of battle , and keep your heart at the lotus feet of the Lord . ’
He is saying , I think , that the battle of life is a game – we must play it with all our heart , but we must not be attached to the outcome .
In this detached state , we can be ready and open to receive wealth or success .
We can pursue these things with energy and passion , but if we cling to them , or pursue them as something of importance , they are likely to elude us .
Lao Tze , who lived seven hundred years before Marcus Aurelius , wrote
“ Those who take hold of the world and act on it
Never , I notice , succeed .
The world is a mysterious instrument ,
Not made to be handled . ”
It seems that Marcus understood this paradox .
Lesson # 6 : All Is Well
“ Everything is unfolding as it must , and if you observe carefully , you will find this to be so . ”
In 1373 , Julian of Norwich was suffering from a severe illness .
Believing she was near death , she had a series of visions .
In one of them , Jesus appeared to her and said , ‘ All will be well , and all will be well , and all manner of things will be well . ’
The idea that things are unfolding as they should is a common theme in the mystical traditions of the world .
Anthony de Mello , in his wonderful book ‘ Awareness , ’ writes ‘ When you awaken , when you understand , when you see , the world becomes right …
You ’ll never explain it …
Life is a mystery , which means your thinking mind cannot make sense out of it . ’
The world looks like a big mess to me , but if we take Marcus ’ advice , sit quietly , abandon our opinions , and simply observe , then perhaps we shall indeed see that ‘ all is well . ’

There ’s a bright side to almost everything , right ?
Even $ 4 per gallon fuel .
If that seems like a stretch as you fork over another $ 80 to fill up your car , consider the bright side :
1 ) There ’s less traffic out there
If you can still afford to drive , the drive ’s less aggravating than it was when gas cost under $ 2 per gallon because there are fewer cars on the road .
Traffic has decreased across the board , nationwide , on both highways and secondary roads as people throttle back on their day - tripping , carpool — or just stay home .
In a way , this is a welcome pause in what had been a relentless annual uptick in the total number of cars on the roads as well as the annual mileage racked up by these cars ( more than 12,000 per year per car , according to most estimates ) .
Driving almost anywhere when gas was $ 2 per or less was becoming a real hassle ; at $ 4 per gallon we may be driving less — but we can actually drive again when we do — instead of staring at the bumper of a minivan with soccer ball stickers all over it as we bump and grind along at 25 mph .
2 ) The argument for telecommuting has become stronger
There are many jobs that do not require the worker ’s physical presence at a traditional office .
However , most employers have been reluctant to allow workers who could work from home to actually work from home .
Part of this is just the inertia of tradition — “ people have always come to an office ” — and part of it is the control freak condescension of employers who suspect that workers wo n’t work if they are n’t stuck in a cubicle and being watched all day long .
However , studies of telecommuting find that productivity actually increases when workers do n’t have to waste an hour or two stuck in traffic just getting to work .
Eliminating the commute can also be a huge financial incentive for both employer and employee .
It amounts to a large “ raise ” ( in the form of savings on gas as well as vehicle wear and tear ) that goes right into the employee ’s pocket but does n’t cost the employer a cent .
Every boss has gotta love that !
3 ) It ’s a great excuse to ride a motorcycle
If you have a bike — and a wife — odds are your wife does n’t much like the bike .
But now you can point out to the wife how much money you ’re saving by riding instead of driving .
Even the biggest cruiser bike ( or fastest crotch rocket ) can usually deliver at least 35 mpg — as good or better fuel economy than almost any subcompact economy car .
Smaller bikes routinely deliver 60 mpg or more — which easily outperforms any hybrid car .
Just switching from a car that gets 20 mpg on average to a bike that gets double that reduces your monthly fuel bill by half .
It ’s hard to argue with that !
4 ) European - spec high performance / high efficiency diesels are coming
Due to the stupidity of our government and its bureaucratic rigmarole — along with inferior quality diesel fuel — the US consumer has been denied 40 mpg high - performance diesel sedans from BMW and Mercedes — as well as 70 mpg small cars from VW and others that handily beat the at - the - pump performance of the best hybrid cars , without costly and complex hybrid vehicle technology .
That is changing — finally .
The US now has low - sulfur diesel fuel — and the legal / regulatory situation ( emissions control issues , mostly ) has been addressed by dint of the fuel issue having been taken care of .
So American consumers should soon be able to buy the kinds of cars the Europeans have been able to buy for years .
Thank $ 4 per gallon fuel for putting the pressure on !

Scientists have for the first time unveiled the unusual genetic make - up of the Australian platypus .
According to the study released this morning in the journal Nature , the semi-aquatic animal is a genetic potpourri - part bird , part reptile and part lactating mammal .
The task of laying bare the platypus genome of 2.2 billion base pairs spread across 18,500 genes has taken several years , but will do far more than satisfy the curiosity of just biologists , say the researchers .
" The platypus genome is extremely important , because it is the missing link in our understanding of how we and other mammals first evolved , " explained Oxford University 's Chris Ponting , one of the study 's architects .
" This is our ticket back in time to when all mammals laid eggs while suckling their young on milk . "
Native to eastern mainland Australia and Tasmania , the semi-aquatic platypus is thought to have split off from a common ancestor shared with humans approximately 170 million years ago .
The creature is so strange that when the first stuffed specimens arrived in Europe at the end of the 18th century , biologists believed they were looking at a taxidermist 's hoax , a composite stitched together from the body of a beaver and the snout of a giant duck .
But the peculiar mix of body features are clearly reflected in the animal 's DNA , the study found .
The platypus is classified as a mammal because it produces milk and is covered in coat of thick fur , once prized by hunters .
Lacking teats , the female nurses pups through the skin covering its abdomen .
There are reptile - like attributes too ; females lay eggs , and males can stab aggressors with a snake - like venom that flows from a spur tucked under its hind feet .
The bird - like qualities implied by its Latin name , Ornithorhynchus anatinus , include webbed feet , a flat bill similar to a duck's , and the gene sequences that determine sex .
Whereas humans have two sex chromosomes , platypuses have 10 , the study showed .
" It is much more of a melange than anyone expected , " said Ewan Birney , who led the genome analysis at the European Bioinformatics Institute in Cambridge .
The animal also possesses a feature unique to monotremes , an order including a handful of egg - laying mammals , called electroreception .
With their eyes , ears and nostrils closed , platypuses rely on sensitive electrosensory receptors tucked inside their bills to track prey underwater , detecting electrical fields generated by muscular contraction .
" By comparing the platypus genome to other mammalian genomes , we 'll be able to study genes that have been conserved throughout evolution , " said senior author Richard Wilson , a researcher at Washington University .
In captivity , platypuses have lived up to 17 years of age .
In the wild , they feed on worms , insect larvae , shrimps and crayfish , eating up to 20 per cent of their body weight everyday .
Males grow to a length of 50 centimetres ( 20 inches ) and weigh about two kilos , with females about 20 per cent shorter and lighter .
The genome sequenced for the study belongs to a female specimen from New South Wales nicknamed Glennie and can be accessed at http://www.ncbi.nih.gov/Genbank.
Jenny Graves from the Australian National University says by mapping the genome , the scientists also found the platypus has an unusual genetic sexual make up .
" In fact the platypus does sex like a bird , we know that other mammals have an X and a Y chromosome and there 's a gene on the Y chromosome that makes you male , that 's SRY and we found there is no SRY in a platypus , " she said .
" In fact , the platypus sex chromosome is derived not from other mammal sex chromosomes but from bird sex chromosomes . "

A " minor planet " with an elongated orbit around the Sun is seen in this undated handout photo .
REUTERS / Ohio State University / Handout
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A newly discovered “ minor planet ” with an elongated orbit around the Sun may help explain the origin of comets , researchers said on Monday .
The object , known as 2006 SQ372 , is starting the outward portion of a 22,500 - year orbit that will take it 150 billion miles away from the Sun .
The icy lump of rock is just over 2 billion miles from Earth , a bit closer than the planet Neptune , researchers told a symposium on Monday .
They will publish their findings in the Astrophysical Journal .
The orbit of 2006 SQ372 is an ellipse four times longer than it is wide , said University of Washington astronomer Andrew Becker , who led the research team .
Sedna , a distant , Pluto - like dwarf planet discovered in 2003 , is the only other object with a similar orbit , but not nearly as stretched out .
The new object is about 60 miles in diameter .
“ It ’s basically a comet , but it never gets close enough to the Sun to develop a long , bright tail of evaporated gas and dust , ” Becker said in a statement .
University of Washington graduate student Nathan Kaib said it is unclear how the object formed , “ It could have formed , like Pluto , in the belt of icy debris beyond Neptune , then been kicked a large distance by a gravitational encounter with Neptune or Uranus , ” Kaib said in a statement .
More likely , he said , it came from the Oort Cloud , a distant reservoir of icy , asteroid - like bodies that orbit the Sun at distances of several trillion miles ( km ) .
“ One of our goals is to understand the origin of comets , which are among the most spectacular celestial events .
But the deeper goal is to look back into the early history of our solar system and piece together what was happening when the planets formed , ” Kaib said .
Fox anchor refuses to talk about anything but Edwards ' affair RAW STORY

In the clip below , Fox News ' Greg Jarrett deflects repeated attempts by U.S. World and News Report columnist Bonnie Erbe to direct the on-air discussion away from " watercooler talk " such as former Senator John Edwards ' recently admitted affair with video producer Rielle Hunter to matters such as the Russians ' invasion of Georgia .
" We have these huge stories going on like the one you 're reporting in Georgia where you have both candidates , McCain and Obama , taking positions that the American public wants to know more about , " Erbe said .
" You know , " Jarrett responded , " his excuse for lying is absolutely stunning .
He claims he denied the affair because the reporting by the National Enquirer was ' 99 % wrong . '
Well , so far , they 've been about 100 % right .
They were right about the affair , the pregnancy , the recent Beverly Hills late - at - night liaison , and what appears to be hush money that was paid to her .
And until he takes a paternity test , he might still be lying , right ?
"
" He might be , " Erbe responded , " and , Greg , let him go on Maury Povich and talk about it .
They 'll get great ratings .
But the American public have told pollsters [ that ] this political season , they want substance .
Both these candidates have expressed support for allowing Georgia into NATO , for example .
We are bound by treaty to attack anybody who attacks a NATO member .
We could have been on the verge of nuclear war .
Those are the kinds of things that the American public want to see discussed . "
" Right , " Jarrett said .
" You know , but getting back to Edwards ... "

The U.S. Justice Department has begun a criminal investigation into whether aluminum maker Alcoa Inc. participated in bribery in the Persian Gulf state of Bahrain .
In documents filed Thursday in U.S. District Court , federal prosecutors asked a judge to halt a federal civil lawsuit that accused Pittsburgh - based Alcoa of bribing officials through overseas shell companies to secure hundreds of millions of dollars in overpayments .
The United States has a direct and substantial interest in this case , as the subject matter giving rise to this case is also the subject of an ongoing federal criminal investigation , ” prosecutors in the Justice Department ’s fraud section said in court filings .
Aluminum Bahrain B.S.C. , also known as Alba , in which the Bahrain government holds a 77 percent stake , is seeking more than $ 1 billion in damages from Alcoa and other affiliated defendants , according to a federal lawsuit filed last month .
“ The Alba complaint alleges numerous facts which , if true , could be relevant to the government ’s criminal investigation and a potential criminal trial , ” prosecutors said in court filings .
“ As the criminal investigation arises out of the same facts and circumstances on which the claims in this civil action are based , the determination of potential liability against possible subjects of the investigation , particularly if they are charged with crimes as a result of the investigation , will turn on the same essential factual questions at issue in this civil action , ” the government said .
Read
Alba , a 30 - year Alcoa customer , and Alcoa do not object to the government ’s request to temporarily halt the civil proceedings , according to court documents .
“ We were approached and asked and we agreed to the stay , ” Alcoa spokesman Kevin Lowery told The Associated Press early Friday .
“ We obviously are going to cooperate fully .
We see this as an opportunity to see a speedy resolution to the entire matter . ”
A Justice Department spokesman did not immediately reply to an e-mail seeking comment early Friday .
Alba , which operates one of the world ’s largest aluminum smelters , also sued Alcoa World Alumina LLC , a global joint venture 60 percent owned by Alcoa and 40 percent owned by Australia ’s Alumina Ltd .
The lawsuit also named William Rice , an Alcoa World Alumina executive , and Victor Dahdaleh , a Canadian citizen who has acted as an agent for Alcoa and Alcoa World Alumina .
After being contacted by Alba about the allegations , Alcoa offered to conduct a full review of its dealings with Alba over the past 20 years , but Alba chose to sue , Lowery said in February .
A “ very fast review ” done by Alcoa found nothing that deviated from standard practices , which prohibit improper activity by the company ’s employees , partners and contractors , Lowery said .
The company was n’t aware of any wrongdoing and would “ vigorously defend ” the lawsuit , he said .
Alba , which buys most of its alumina — a material used to make aluminum — from Alcoa and its affiliated companies , alleged the defendants bribed one or more former senior officials of Alba and the Bahrain government to persuade the company to cede a controlling interest in the company to Alcoa and to pay inflated prices for alumina .
The scheme began in 1993 and is ongoing , but was not found out until last year , the lawsuit claimed .
The lawsuit also alleged the bribes were sent through a series of shell companies the defendants ultimately controlled .
Alcoa , the world ’s third - largest aluminum producer , reported 2007 revenue of $ 30.75 billion , an all - time record .

Acclaimed novels , a knighthood and , most tellingingly , the fatwa which forced him into hiding have made him one of the most celebrated , and controversial , authors of our age .
His latest book returns to the tortured relationship between East and West ; its other obsession is with the power of female beauty .
Here he reveals how writing it helped him escape the painful break - up of his marriage to Padma Lakshmi .
By Andrew Anthony
Among other things , Salman Rushdie 's latest novel , The Enchantress of Florence , is a hymn to the creative and destructive power of female beauty .
The heroine is a young woman of such transporting physical allure that on seeing her men fall instantly and insanely in love , heedless to the ensuing dangers .
Wherever could he have come by the idea ?
' Ridiculously beautiful , comically beautiful ' was how he once described Padma Lakshmi , the woman who became his fourth wife .
But in fact , Rushdie insists , he had the concept of the novel before he met the Indian - American model , actress and cookbook author .
Still , that piece of chronology wo n't prevent many readers from glimpsing the shade of Lakshmi in the ' slender ' and ravishing ' banquet for the senses ' that is Qara Koz , a woman ' meant for palaces , and kings ' .
To be fair to Lakshmi , she seemed more at home at premieres than palaces , but then celebrity is the new royalty .
From a distance , or more specifically through the prism of gossip columns , she looked like trouble from the very start , someone who was unlikely ever to provide a happy ending , at least in the conventional narrative sense .
According to Rushdie , the irony is that not only did she not inspire the book , she was very nearly the cause of its demise .
' To put it bluntly , ' he says , ' I had to write it in spite of her .
Because what happened to me last year when I was writing this book was a colossal calamity . '
By this he means the end of his marriage .
In January of 2007 , Lakshmi asked for a divorce .
' It was like a nuclear bomb dropped in your living room when you 're trying to work , ' he says .
' I really feared for a time at the beginning of last year that I 'd lost the book .
I was in such a state of turmoil that I could n't work .
I 've always prided myself on my discipline as a writer .
I do it like a job .
I get up in the morning and go to my desk .
And I got scared because I thought , if I lose this , I 've lost everything .
Genuinely , I think it was the biggest act of will that I 've ever been asked to make , including after the fatwa , just to pull my head back together . '
We meet in the Bloomsbury offices of his agent , Andrew Wylie , lined with copies of Roth , Eggers , Amis and , of course , Rushdie .
It has to be said that he looks , head and all , remarkably together .
He 's dressed down in jeans and a casual yellow shirt , but everything else about him seems up .
He 's pleased with the novel , a fabulous interweaving of fiction and history across two continents , though his critics would say this is nothing new .
Rushdie has a longstanding reputation , unfairly or not , for being pleased with himself .
There is , however , no sign of smugness or superiority about the man across the desk from me .
The famous mandarin hauteur is gone .
What he emanates is relief .
He says there was a period , after Lakshmi left him , that he worked eight or nine hours a day for six weeks and produced ' about three pages ' .
But at the end of this block , he refound the story .
' And from then the book saved my life really .
It just wrote itself .
Voom .
I would go to my desk every day and I was having more fun in there than I was having outside .
It became joyful to write and I think some of that feeling of pleasure is there in the text . '
Indeed one of the pleasures of the book is the sense of delight that the prose takes in conjuring seductive myths from the solid foundations of history .
' A lot of it is true , ' he says of the historical detail .
' All kinds of stuff that I suspect people will assume is magic realism , is n't . '
Rushdie has obviously done his homework , going by the six - page heavyweight bibliography included at the end of the book .
' Oh that 's not the show - off bibliography , ' he says with a smile that hints , but only hints , at self - mockery .
' There 's one that 's about four times as long , but you know you read a lot of books and not all of them are useful to you .
So I just put in the ones that really helped . '
The story concerns a young European traveller who arrives at the court of the 16th - century Mughal Emperor Akbar , and beguiles his host with tales of Qara Koz , a legendary beauty who entrances powerful men .
One of these men , the Shah of Persia , is so full of self - love and vanity that 'he did not consider the autonomy of her great beauty , which no man could own , which owned itself , and which would blow wherever it pleased , like the wind ' .
Again , it does n't require a literary detective to sniff out the pungent aroma of experience in this passage .
But what 's notable about it , and indeed the whole of the book , given the circumstances of its creation , is the impressive lack of bitterness or rancour .
Instead it 's almost a celebration of male amour fou .
The other major theme of the book is an old one for Rushdie , namely the mutual suspicion , mistrust and misunderstanding that has long existed between the East and the West .
It 's an issue , of course , that has seldom been more pertinent .
At first he is reluctant to expand on the parallels .
' I 'm just going to let the reader decide about that .
My view is that I did n't want to put great big neon signs in the sky saying this is really about the 21st century . '
But while Rushdie handles the subject with imaginative subtlety , there is no getting away from the current relevance of subjects like foreignness , belonging and group loyalty .
In one sense , he is an old - fashioned humanist , drawn to the stripped - down commonality of man .
' One of the things that I came to feel more than before , while writing the book , and it's not a very complicated truth , is the idea that human nature really is constant .
And that the way in which human beings behave is just the way we behave , no matter what age we live in , and what our technology is , and what our particular political relations at the moment might be .'
In other words , it 's our similarities , rather than our differences , that are our defining characteristic .
But at the same time , he is pessimistic about the future of East - West relations .
' I do worry about it .
If you have children you worry about the world you 're leaving them .
I hope I 'm wrong but the best - case optimistic argument I can make is that if you look at the phenomenon of Islamic extremism , the places where it 's most hated are the places where it 's most powerful . '
Early in his career , he approached global affairs from a classic post - imperial perspective , which placed the burden of responsibility for geopolitical tension and cultural discrimination firmly with the wealthy West .
Having graduated from Cambridge in 1968 , his politics were not untypical of his generation and class .
There was an implied , and often explicit , criticism of western hegemony in his work .
In The Satanic Verses , he writes of ' the Coca - Colonization of the planet ' and refers to New York as the ' transatlantic New Rome with its Nazified architectural gigantism , which employed the oppressions of size to make its human occupants feel like worms ' .
Rushdie still has his criticisms of America , where he lives for much of the time in the architectural gigantism of New York , but they are now moderated by a keener appreciation of the freedoms and advantages of western democracy .
He remains a committed multiculturalist .
' I could n't exist were it not for that transcultural movement .
So obviously I 'm biased .
I do think , still think , there 's a lot to celebrate about this mixture .
If you live in a city like this or New York it 's not possible to imagine it as monocultural .
So in a sense it 's clearly an enriching aspect of our daily lives . '
But he now has reservations about the direction that cultural diversity has taken .
' What I worry about and do n't like , ' he says , 'is the way in which the ideology of multiculturalism has declined into cultural relativism .
I think that 's very dangerous .
When the Archbishop of Canterbury , for God 's sake , says that you can't have one law for everybody ... that 's stupid . '
Rushdie would argue , with some justification , that he was never a proponent of cultural relativism .
Nevertheless the event that made him an outspoken opponent was the fatwa on his life issued by the Ayatollah Khomeini on Valentine 's Day in 1989 .
It was a defining moment in the cultural wars that have grown dramatically more political in recent years .
Two hundred years after the Enlightenment , an author was under sentence of death for writing fiction .
Suddenly all those beliefs , such as freedom of expression , that seemed so basic to literary and liberal life that no one bothered mentioning them were put to the ultimate life - and - death test .
And a number of writers , among them Germaine Greer , John Berger and John Le Carré , came down on the cultural relativist side of the argument .
Their feeling was that , in not showing sufficient cultural sensitivity , Rushdie was the author of his troubles .
Meanwhile Rushdie found himself in the strange position of having to rely on the support of the Prime Minister , Margaret Thatcher , and agencies of the establishment - Special Branch and the intelligence services - of which he had been stern critic .
Did this affect his feelings towards the establishment ?
' Yes , ' he says , ' sort of .
I only met Margaret Thatcher twice .
The thing that I thought about meeting her was how extraordinarily intelligent she was .
You really had to be on your game otherwise she 'd make mincemeat of you . '
He developed not just an admiration , but a fondness for many people he came to know within the security and intelligence services .
' I 've met a lot of Special Branch officers both at the everyday and higher levels and , with one or two exceptions , I liked all of them .
I still have , improbably , quite a lot of friends in the British Special Branch . '
The only unkind words he has are reserved for the Foreign Office , which he found untrustworthy .
' I 've always been able to handle anything as long as people are straight with you , ' he says .
' Deviousness I can't deal with .
That 's not to my taste . '
He says that his access to this covert world , as well as to presidents , prime ministers and foreign ministers , makes him - or a bit of him - want to write a spy thriller .
If he did , I say , it would be sure to be reviewed by John Le Carré ( some observers suggest that Le Carré 's unsympathetic stance on The Satanic Verses was prompted by a poor review Rushdie had given one of his books ) .
' I think that 's all right now , ' laughs Rushdie .
' The truth is I hate literary feuds .
Life 's too short .
I admire so much of his work ... I do n't want to fight him .
We had a disagreement .
Fair enough , I have no hard feelings . '
He ascribes this spirit of forgiveness to the passage of time , and in particular the passing of the edict .
It 's been a decade since the Iranian government withdrew their support for the fatwa , effectively allowing Rushdie back into civilian life .
He says it now feels like something that happened to him in the past .
There was a brief reprise last year when Rushdie was awarded a knighthood .
A few opportunists in Pakistan , and clowns like Lord Ahmed over here , tried to generate a firestorm of protest , but it came to nothing .
Though it did produce one golden vignette on Question Time , when Shirley Williams argued that the knighthood was ' not very clever ' because Rushdie had ' deeply offended Muslims in a very powerful way ' , and he had ' been protected by the British police for many years at great expense to the taxpayer ' .
The Liberal Democrat Baroness was then taken apart by Rushdie 's friend , Christopher Hitchens .
Others were simply surprised that Rushdie had accepted an award that seems inseparable from Britain 's class - based and , even colonial , past .
He says that he was simply delighted to be ' honoured in the same way as William Golding and VS Naipaul and Kingsley Amis and VS Pritchett .
I 'll be in that club , I do n't mind . '
But people look at your history coming from the left ....
' Yeah , ' he interrupts , ' well frankly I do n't give a fuck about that . '
Since 2001 , he 's been joined in the political arena by a number of fellow authors , some of whom have taken up a more prominent , and sometimes more controversial , position than Rushdie .
' I think , fair enough , ' says Rushdie .
' It 's a big subject that everybody 's thinking about .
I do n't agree with all Christopher Hitchens 's views but that does n't stop him being my friend .
And I do n't agree with everything Martin [ Amis ] said , but he 's entirely entitled to say it without being abused in the way that he was . '
VS Naipaul may find that comment a little rich .
In a 2002 article attacking the massacres of Muslims in India , Rushdie said that in supporting Hindu nationalism , Naipaul ' makes himself a fellow - traveller of fascism and disgraces the Nobel award ' .
The point for Rushdie , however , is that he and his friends remain on the progressive side of the argument .
' My instincts are completely liberal , but I do think we live in a very weird world and we do need to realise that the world has changed .
And when Martin , Ian [ McEwan ] and I say that we get called conservative .
But , ' he emphatically adds , 'we 're not conservative . '
It 's the one moment of annoyance he shows .
A lot of the interview is spent discussing politics , everything from the debate on strengthening British anti-terror laws ( ' I 'm somewhere in the middle , really ' ) to the authoritarian actions of the Bush administration , but Rushdie insists he wants to get away from the subject .
He resents being recruited to positions he does not hold , a legacy , he thinks , of the fatwa .
' I was always a writer who was interested in politics , and then I think I had an overdose of it - be careful what you wish for .
And one of the effects on my sensibility is to make me want to back away from public discourse .
I just want to stay at home and write stories and send them out every couple of years .
That 's why I got into the game , not to be some major public spokesman on political issues . '
The next book he wants to write is another children 's book , a sequel of sorts to Haroun and the Sea of Stories .
' When I wrote Haroun , ' he explains , 'my then only son was 10 .
Now I 've got another 10 - year - old who is busily saying , " Where 's my book ? " '
He considers this for a second , and then demonstrating his new - found equanimity , adds with a smile : ' That seems like a fair question . '

The arrogance of the neo-con support media is breathtaking almost as bizarre as the arrogance of their driving force - Rove .
More news this week of neo -con defenders disparaging the public and treating us like dirt is on display in 9/11 Blogger 's / We are Change 's Willy Brown answering questions about his warning not to fly on 9/11 as reported correctly ( which was never before disputed by Brown ) at the time by the SF Chronicle .
Brown says now , rewriting history , they were wrong .
He also told a person questioning him about this with anger , " You 're full of % $ #@ . "

Exactly .
I did n't realize this story existed until I read Brad 's American Gangsters post .
But just looking around the last days , it is clear that this is n't new news .
This has been around for a while but has been censored / obfuscated .
The following website is a joke , but I did start a thread there on this subject .
For the longest time , none of the plants and useful idiots responded .
It was liberal / progressive city .
The pigs needed time to figure out their strategies .
Only one of them showed up .
He has been going with the but , but , but Clinton .
This forum used to be owned by Arianna Huffington , until she moved to the Huffington Post .

I called " Fintan Dunne " out for not covering the Siegalman story .
He 's the guy who put Brad Friedman , RawStory , and a few other decent links with a good chunk of links which are probably at the least CIA / NSA influenced .
I called him out for putting Brad on his CIA fakes list .
I followed his link to the Democratic Underground .
A few folks made the good argument that Dunne is a disinfo , Rovian type .
That guy destroyed a really good psy - op .
Steven Hertzberg was writing all over his forum .
He got an interview with Ron Paul .
I 'll find the link if folks want , but he has also decoded an alien language !
I write this because its creeps like John Caylor and " Fintan Dunne " who make a mockery out of real progressives trying to work together to make this a better world .
Not one of his crew has started a thread on Don Siegelman .
I did see one thread at Kos , but I had to seek it out .
Correct me if I 'm wrong , but I bet it is n't a big story over there .
It 'd be interesting to see if Kos has written anything about it personally .
I wo n't link to Dunne .
It is a joke of a place .
Here 's the thread where his Karl Rove tendencies began to emerge .
This was at the Democratic Underground .
Who else would attack people like RawStory and Bradblog but Republican / rightwing operatives ?
Proof that BradBlog is CIA , LOL Posted by Mastiff # 36 {on the Madsen story} I think it is too early to push this story .
This stuff may be true .
However , it has the look of a " Aluminum Foil Hat " expose .
Let 's wait for more evidence .
Pushing the story now just takes notice away from our proven evidence .
I 'm sure you noted how Republicans pilloried Dan Rather over Memogate .
The story was true .
The evidence was faked .
Bush was not fulfilling his contracted obligations to the TANG .
However , no one followed up on this .
They just went after Rather .
https://bradblog.com/?p=1025
posted by Brad Friedman : ... While Madsen 's article was independently researched and reported --- and offers some very good detail in relation to Curtis , YEI , FDOT and Feeney , much of which that we can confirm --- he then ties those stories to a much grander CIA / Bush family conspiracy .
While we have looked somewhat cursorily over the last several weeks into some of the larger matters which Madsen discusses , and has been reporting on for some time , we cannot confirm any of those grander details as playing any part in this particular story .
While his claims may be true , The BRAD BLOG has seen no evidence to support them as being related to the Curtis story at this time .
Frankly , we find the information related in Curtis ' sworn affidavit , and via our interviews with him and others directly related to his story to be rather stunning as is , and we will stand by our reporting of those matters at this time .
Would n't it be in the interests of Karl Rove and his people to smear shining lights like BradBlog and RawStory ?
I sincerely believe it is beyond bizarre that Steven Hertzberg was so prolific at BreakForNews .
He was buddies with Fintan and even did a few interviews with him as " Navari . "
Hertzberg , who was supposed to be helping solve the widespread election fraud was a prolific poster at a tinfoil website who placed leading election integrity activists like Bev Harris and Brad Friedman on list of CIA internet fakes .
Wow .
A few days a buddy of Madsen shows up and calls RawStory and Brad the Russian mafia and CIA respectively .
Here 's one thread on Siegelman I found at KOS :
http://www.dailykos.com/...25/212240/766/699/464080
Don Siegelman can't appeal his conviction .

Siegelman was not a strict constructionist in the way McCain and right - wingnuts define the term .
Siegelman would say that John McCain is a natural born Citizen , even tho McCain was born in the Panama Canal Zone , because his parents were natural born citizens .

OT : Correction of Dredd's # 8 comment :
Oh , Dredd , lovie ,
I never worked for Ed Bass .
I was merely an acquaintance who was acquainted with some of his closest friends at the Caravan of Dreams ( Ed Bass 's personal play palace ) which had live theater , live jazz , and lots of kinds of art featured and a dome on the top of the building with rare plants from Madagascar and an outdoor grotto / bar .
It was the arts that I was going there for .
Ornette Coleman recorded an album there .
I met Muddy Waters , Dr. John , John McLaughlin the virtuoso guitar player , Kirk Whalem , the saxophonist , Hugh Masacala , " Momma Africa " who was imprisoned for 30 years as a political prisoner along with Nelson Mandela , Ziggy Marley , and many , many famous talented people , I saw plays there and also made friends with talented locals .
I was networking for local artists of all sorts for a non -profit arts alliance organization to have exhibitions , shows to help the locals know that we have talent in our city , and to help the artists themselves make a living with their art , and to give them business and tax advice .
I am proud of that work and enjoyed it immensely .
I never had any knowledge of any Bass / Bush business dealings .
However , I am not surprised that the wealthy of Texas do business with the wealthy of Texas .
{ I fixed yer typo , but I do n't believe you 're Dredd 's girlfriend !
No one would have him !
And he wo n't let you correct him !
He 's going to argue till the day he dies that you did TOO work for Ed Bass .
Mark my words !

To All of the above , re : Dredd 's girlfriendd : A . Thanks , but it was not a typo .
B. I 'm afraid you are both wrong .
Dredd does have a girlfriendd , but only one .
That would be me .
We live together and just bought a house together ,
with 6 ( only 2 in the song ) cats in the yard .... Life used to be so - o -o hard .
Now everthything is easy cause of ( Dredd ) ....
Crosby , Stills , and Nash .
C. Dredd and I have twin bumpers stickers .
D. Dredd...shortcomings ... what shortcomings ?
E. I assure you I am neither beleaguered nor an old battle axe .
Well , maybe some of the old part .
F. Dredd and I have faced many challenges in life together and have fended off many storms .
There is no one I 'd rather have on my side when I need someone in my corner .
G. The very essence of understanding Dredd is precisely to understand his complex sense of humor .
H. I believe that most women are attracted to a fine mind and a multi-dimensional sense of humor
I. Besides , he has one of those cute tight duck butts that women love and I 'm not bad looking myself .
Thanks for being interested in Dredd 's love life .
I 'll be sure he notes your concern .

Tipjoy is a web startup for tipping web authors / personalities funded by Y Combinator .
It went live in February to decent press coverage .
The concept is simple — if you see something you like tip the author by either clicking on participating author ’s link , using the Tipjoy bookmarklet or going to the Tipjoy site and entering the URL .
It ’s a good idea and the founders have worked hard to overcome a number of the inherent problems with small money transfers .
However , there ’s one little problem remaining .
It ’s not generating revenue .
On the main page of Tipjoy the technically savvy , but perhaps not as financially savvy , authors post their latest statistics :
$ 2,519.01 ( red arrow ) is not a large sum of money .
Compound that with the time period indicated by the blue arrow .
Elsewhere in the site founders explain that they charge a 3 % transaction fee .
In other words they pulled in $ 75.57 over 4 months .
Nice .
Probably does n’t even cover hosting fees .
Of course this is n’t the full story .
There is likely between a few hundred up to a few thousand dollars sitting in accounts either waiting to be given out as tips or claimed by the tip recipients .
With money markets at around 2.5 % that may represent another $ 20 in interest .
Thrilling .
It appears the failure to generate revenue has had it ’s costs .
The founders have n’t blogged for nearly a month — and previous postings are uninspiring to say the least .
It seems that around the end of March the founders attention wandered from the site — after less that 2 months live !
How many successful businesses ever got it right in that short of time ?
< Right now imagine a typical rant about generation Y’s failure to follow through >
OK , now clear those thoughts .
Generation bashing is never fair .
Let ’s look at the site itself .
First , what ’s right .
Design :
It ’s an easy to understand , easy to use site .
The color scheme is clear and inviting .
Concept :
The idea is simple and the implementation is straightforward .
Technology : Excellently implemented .
The site is n’t foundering through lack of technical expertise .
Ease of use :
It took about 15 seconds to sign up .
Try it .
So what went wrong wrong ?
Let ’s disassemble it a bit :
Product :
In my opinion the product stinks .
No , not the idea .
The idea is great .
Not the implementation .
It ’s a solid web site .
But the product .
Let me illustrate .
As you may know I live in Tennessee and it gets hot in the summer .
A few years ago a deer got hit by a car along the road I drive to work .
After a few days of that mid-summer heat that thing could be smelled from nearly a mile away .
Some people may take from that experience that deer stink .
Well , not all deer .
Rotten deer .
This product is rotten .
Tipping is a very abstract “ product ” .
“ Social well being ” is probably as close as it gets .
One evening my wife and I dined at our local Olive Garden and by bad luck ended up with a barely competent–if that –waiter .
Luckily the lady serving tables near us was very good and bailed him out a couple times .
Understandably his tip was very small .
But on the way out the door I slipped her a couple bucks .
She felt good and I felt good .
Replicating that experience on - line is difficult .
Tipjoy is notably lacking in that regard .
The main page is made up of a bunch of ( dry ) statistics .
Hello , this is n’t Microsoft Excel !
What are they trying to sell — business analytics ??
Where ’s the sidebar advertising how your Tipjoy data can be added to your Facebook / Myspace site ?
Where ’s the banner that says “ Show your girlfriend you really like her latest Facebook post ? ” .
Where ’s the “ attach a message to the tip ” feature ?
Tipjoy is a social site — it must market itself as a social service .
It must integrate into life , or life will continue to pass by outside of it .
Advertising : People have to know about a site in order to use it .
Tipjoy did enjoy good initial coverage from TechCrunch and other scattered outlets .
However , it lacks long - term support .
If I were them I ’d contact as many bloggers and Myspacers ( if that ’s what they ’re called — I ’m getting too old school for that stuff ) to include links on their sites .
Tipjoy must become integrated into the social framework .
And one last thing .
No credit cards ?
Hey dudes , it ’s 2008 , Web 2.0 .
Instead of “ Coming Soon ” it should say “ transaction charge ” .
Leave the choice to the consumer .
Lesson :
To succeed in Web 2.0 your site can not be an optional layer added to people ’s lives .
It must be inserted directly into the lives of the consumer .
Until Tipjoy finds that recipe it can only founder .
Like this article ?
Leave me a tip
Disclaimer : I have no investment in Tipjoy , nor do I have any business relationship with the company .
I do n’t know the founders personally , but best wishes to them .
I have only the greatest respect for anyone who has the guts to start a new company .
My analysis may sound harsh , but remember that anyone who gets as far as Tipjoy is clearly a star .

There 's no official obituary for GM 's HUMMER brand yet , but haters are lacing up their dancing shoes while lovers wring their hands .
Dealers with HUMMER franchises have a lot of skin in the game , so the uncertain future is bound to give business officers ulcers .
Not willing to wait around to the bitter end , Milwaukee 's Bergstrom HUMMER is planning to move into the same space as the group 's Chevrolet store .
The HUMMER - specific Quonset hut style dealership building will be toned down and pressed into service as an outlet for Certified used GM vehicles .
Other HUMMER dealers across the nation are staring down the same conundrum , being on the hook for that big , rugged showroom , test track , inventory , and staff , while the parent company looks to clamp off bleeders .
Some might follow Bergstrom 's lead and shove the big trucks into a corner of a showroom dominated by a more stable brand , while others are shipping inventory as fast as they can .
Moving product is a tremendous challenge when the bobbleheads on the nightly news continue shrilly about the price of fuel and you 've got a lot full of low - mpg , high weight trucks that happen to be a favorite target of vandals euphemistically masquerading as " activists . "
Customers that do make it through the door are looking for deals , and HUMMER will spot you five thousand bucks to take an H3 , PLEASE .
Existing customers are looking to get out of their vehicles any way possible , even if it means a financial hit .
The mass exodus is n't solely due to hysteria , when it costs over $ 100 to fill the fuel tank , it chafes to watch the fuel gauge 's precipitously quick drop toward " E. " Retail issues aside , HUMMER still offers capable vehicles with a high level of style .
If you 've got a boat to pull , and want to look like the Governator , an H2 could still be just the thing , and now you 'll be able to find one for a song ; most likely the blues .

Get updates impacting your industry from our GigaOm Research Community
One of the problems with Comcast ’s new 250 GB bandwidth cap is that , as Om points out on GigaOM , it ’s metered without a meter .
Comcast does n’t provide you with a central tally of all your data use .
The company instead suggests its customers install bandwidth metering software on their machines and then add up the numbers .
Its FAQ reads : “ Customers using multiple PCs should just be aware that they will need to measure and combine their total monthly usage in order to identify the data usage for their entire account . ”
Got multiple home machines consuming data every day ?
Better bust out that spreadsheet — and get ready for some wild guesstimates .
After all , you ca n’t just install a bandwidth metering application on your Slingbox .
The Slingbox is only one example of why the absence of a central bandwidth meter for your account is not inconvenient , but a central flaw in Comcast ’s cap .
More and more devices are bringing video to the living room , in turn consuming huge amounts of bandwidth .
Most of them are not computers , but home entertainment devices with simplified interfaces that do n’t burden their users with complicated stats and settings .
That makes for a good user experience — unless you ’re a Comcast customer that ’s already using a lot of data and the box in your living room is busting your bandwidth - capped behind .
Here are five innocent - looking devices that could get you in trouble with Comcast :
The Slingbox :
This should n’t clock too much bandwidth — unless you ’re , say , a sports junkie stuck in a cubicle , trying watch as many NFL games as possible while your boss is out of the office .
The bandwidth consumption of your Slingbox largely depends on your ISP ’s upstream capability .
Many users access their video with 400 - 500 kbps , which comes to about a Gigabyte for 5 or 6 hours , but the recently unvieled Slingbox HD has no problems eating up 2 Mbps , or about 900 Megabyte per hour .
Americans watch about 8 hours of TV a day , so you could theoretically rack up to 212 gigs per month if you put the HD Slingbox to full use .
The XBox 360 : Microsoft ’s gaming console features HD downloads straight to the living room .
Movies are around 5 GB a pop ; TV shows , 2 GB .
That means that getting addicted to Battlestar Galactica and downloading all four available seasons for a multiweekend marathon eats up about half of your monthly Comcast bandwidth .
Your good old TiVo : Broadband - connected TiVo machines download their EPG data through your Comcast line , but can also be used for Amazon Unbox downloads .
The typical Unbox movie is about 2 - 3 gigs .
Then there free are podcasts , which could add up to a few gigs per week .
Oh , and did I mention you can access Last.fm or Real Rhapsody through your TiVo as well ?
Five hours of music per day eat up about 9 gigs per month .
The Netflix Roku :
This little box streams Netflix movies straight to your TV , at up to 2.2 Mbps .
A Roku box gives you “ unlimited access ” to a fairly limited catalog of 12,000 titles , so you probably wo n’t spend all your quality tube time with this device .
Still , just watching a single movie per day with your Roku uses up more than 40 GB per month .
Vudu ’s set - top box :
This one may not be around for much longer , but it ’s still worth mentioning because it uses P2P distribution to deliver content , which means more bits on your bill .
The company ’s web site is n’t too forthcoming about the bandwidth use of its product , and in fact hardly mentions the uploading activity at all , but users of the official Vudu forum report that the box utilizes between 200 and 300 Kbps upload capacity for serving content to others .
This most likely wo n’t happen all day long , but one streamed movie and 5 hours of P2P content serving per day still could cause up to 60 GB of traffic per month .
To be sure , most of these devices are n’t using up those 250 GB on their own .
But they ’re consuming enough bandwidth to get you in trouble , and even get your contract with Comcast terminated , especially if you ’re already backing up lots of data to Mozy while surfing YouTube and listening to Internet radio all day .

If these are the most important hearings ever , then why is it that Conyers stated BEFORE they even took place that impeachment is not going to be an issue ?
Hearings are n't important AT ALL if the decision has already been made to NOT hold anyone accountable .
Oh well .
Maybe Conyers will write yet another threatening letter to the administration and then continue to wonder why nothing works .
Dear Democrats , if you refuse to hold this admnistration accountable FOR ANYTHING , then stop acting surprised when the adminsitration continues to break the law and make you look like impotent fools .

The problem is Nancy Pelosi has threatened to remove Conyers from his chairmanship should he pursue impeachment hearings .
Moreover , we 're asking Nancy Pelosi to approve of impeachment hearings / investigations that would probably incriminate herself .
I do n't know how we get around this .
Anyone got any ideas ?
Can immunity be offered to Pelosi so investigations can move forward ?
If so , by whom ? - Tom

These were important hearings .
It was hard listening to the shrill , idiotic denials of some of the Regressionists sheep .
They kept bringing up Clinton and suggesting that these hearings were distracting the committee from the terrorists .
Old Old Old .
Many brilliant witnesses , who spoke with such authority on our Constitution .
Everyone should have had to watch these hearings before they voted .
Nancy Pelosi , you need to get it together .
Nothing they have on you can be worse than losing your integrity like this .
The power grab by this administration is appalling and if we do n't do anything about it , we will see the end of our great democracy .
Thank you , Rep Kucinich .
Thank you to all the witnesses and members of the committee who managed to look past party to do their duty to the American people .

Karen Kwiatowsky should be called as a witness .
She worked in the Pentagon and knows what the Office of Special Plans was doing , and do n't forget all of " Deadeye " Dick 's visits to the C.I.A .
I certainly hope Ms. Kwiatowsky does n't meet with an unfortuenate early death as the D.C. Madam did .

The full house has to approve an impeachment resolution .
And boy do I want such to happen .
The question to put to every representative is why , given Mukasey 's refusal to submit contempt to a grand jury ( a felony ) and the obvious other law violations that deserve the ' prosecutorial ' inquiry of an impeachment hearing - including the simple one item discussed by the witnesses - are they willing to vote against such an inquiry ( which is what an impeachment hearing is ) .

Sure got a lot of extra time .
I hope everybody that spoke , on Conyers directions to comment and change testimony for 5 days , go back and " change their testimony to point exactly at WHO did and said what as opposed to leaving it " high level officials in the executive . "
What utter nonsense .

Yes , it was the most important hearing I 've ever watched .
Also , encouraged my brother to watch it later .
I personally believe the Rep. members who failed to hold any oversight hearings for 6 years be restricted to 1 minute questions .
Also , any member who does n't support impeachment of the executive officers should be exposed and voted out of office .
Dem. or Rep .
If these are not High Crimes of the Highest Officials of the United States than we can all look forward to the fall of this democracy .

A person of interest who is NEVER mentioned anywhere , possibly because he keeps a VERY low profile , is the main reason that Nancy Pelosi keeps her head hidden where the sun does n't shine and threatens to remove Conyers from his job if he pursues his sworn Constitutional duty is a fascist by the name of Felix Rohatyn , who was one of the financiers behind Pinochet 's rise to power in Chile , who is a figure in Lazard Freres , one of the institutions responsible for the accession to power of both Mussolini and Hitler , and who is one of the financiers supplying money to the Democrats , is an alleged " Friend " of Nancy's , and DEFINITELY controls her every action !
NO ONE should be allowed uncheckable access to power such as Rohatyn has , and a thorough investigation of his machinations would be illuminating .
Knowing that his philosophical bent is Fascist to the core , his prevention of impeachment hearings - and protection of both Bush and Cheney , one realizes that his essential ownership of the leadership of the " Democratic " Party undermines the very idea of the " Two Party System . "
When you have BOTH parties in your pocket , any progress in directions you do not favor becomes impossible .
I have no idea what can be done about this criminal mastermind ; even an exposé would get no play in the captive media , which largely shares his desires .

" The problem is Nancy Pelosi has threatened to remove Conyers from his chairmanship should he pursue impeachment hearings . " +++
So what ?
He 's not likely to end up in a soup - kitchen line --- like so many veterans whose lives have been blasted in these immoral , illegal wars Pelosi has voted for over and over .
Conyers has done some wise and brave things .
But the Constitution is more important than how you rank in inside - Beltway gossip columns .
The founders , remember , signed their names and " ... pledged to each other their Lives , their Fortunes and their sacred Honor . "
That was not tavern blather ; they would have been hung without question if caught ...
Conyers took the oath , to defend the Constitution against all enemies , foreign and DOMESTIC .
He needs to act on it .

California 's porn tax / Violet Blue has serious concerns when lawmakers get in bed with fundamentalists for a ' money shot '
If California lawmakers are going to levy a draconian vice tax on porn , it seems only fair that consumers get to decide what kind of porn should be taxed .
For instance , only really bad porn should cost extra at the checkout counter .
Is it from the 1980s ?
Tax that ass .
Starlets with breasts that look like face - hugging aliens about to explode and kill viewers ?
Check .
Does it feature performers who emit noises that prompt my neighbors to call Animal Care and Control out of concern ?
That will cost you extra , pal .
Scary fingernails , racial stereotypes , formulaic Cirque du Soleil sex positions , using the same five guys that seem to be in every straight porn film ?
Definitely charge extra to anyone who masturbates to that .
I could really get behind this porn tax thing if it meant seeing less of Evan Stone on my desktop .
But what Assembly member Charles Calderon , D - Montebello , wants to do to shore up California 's pasta strainer of a budget by pushing a bill to tax porn makes about as much sense as taxing films like " Das Bootie , " " Spray It Forward " or " Blowjob Impossible " to create a slush fund .
Calderon says his bill could raise as much as $ 665 million in tax revenue each year off the $ 4 billion - a - year porn industry ( though a reliable source for this dollar figure has yet to be produced in any media quote ) .
This cherry pie - in - the - sky figure would go into creating and fueling an " Adult Entertainment Impact Fund . "
Calderon 's titty - tax is morally motivated :
He would use the tax revenue to mitigate the cost to taxpayers of " secondary effects " generated by the industry , such as " law enforcement at adult venues , testing and treatment for sexually transmitted diseases and other social services . "
Tom White , Calderon 's chief of staff , is widely quoted as saying , " There is a high rate of drug and alcohol abuse in the industry , STDs , mental health problems and pregnancies .
The industry is such that oftentimes people get burned through and come out with nothing , no job skills or education , so they need job training or state services . "
Yes , Calderon — and his fundie cronies — want to tax your lube to save our schools .
Calderon 's AB 2914 is sort of the anti-porn , anti-masturbation superhero :
The 25 percent tax would be levied on strip club fees , pornographic movies , pay - per - view films , sex toys and more .
A close read of the bill shows that the tax would be applied to anything that falls under federal record - keeping requirements under the ( repeatedly struck down and continually challenged ) 2257 Section 18 laws .
This means any item , including but not limited to a book , magazine , periodical , film , videotape , digital image or digitally or computer - manipulated image that includes " sexually explicit conduct . "
According to AB 2914 , sexually explicit conduct is defined as " sexual intercourse , including genital - genital , oral - genital , anal - genital or oral - anal , whether between persons of the same or opposite sex ; masturbation ; sadistic or masochistic abuse ; lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area of any person . "
Taxing porn because it 's categorically bad is a slam - dunk for wining support : Manufactured outrage always gets the job done in politics when it comes to gay marriage , wars , sexual predators and porn .
Calderon 's been press - touring the bill with former porn stars who 've loudly found God and — like the bill itself — take for granted that everyone 's just going to buy 30 - year - old anti-porn myths : porn 's alleged " secondary effects . "
And here we just thought that porn 's negative secondary effects were those tough - to - remove stains on the couch , a little RSI after a viewing of " On Golden Blonde , " or a sticky mouse .
But according to Calderon 's bill , sex toys , pay - per - view cable porn and my weary copy of " Buffy the Vampire Layer " increase crime at or near production locations , adversely impact mental health and lead to increased alcohol and substance abuse by those involved , increase the performers ' chances of contracting a sexually transmitted disease , encourage unsafe sex by consumers , often encourage sexually aggressive behavior toward women , and increase the medical costs of the participants in the production of adult entertainment and adult entertainment merchandise .
I 'll agree with the safer sex bit — porn makes some really awful choices when it comes to modeling safer sex practices .
But along with increasing crime , the alleged " secondary effects " of " Boobarella " also seem to make the whole entire world a dangerous place .
" The Internet provides the children of this state with easy access to sexual content , which may negatively influence their developing attitudes toward sexuality and relationships .
Adult entertainment venues adversely impact the character of local neighborhoods by , among other things , reducing local property values , curtailing development , and engendering many types of criminal activities .
Adult entertainment venues endanger the health , safety and welfare of citizens in their vicinity .
These negative secondary effects , in turn , drain public resources dedicated to public social service programs , and place a significant strain on the courts of this state . "
Calderon apparently knows all of this is true because Los Angeles has crime near its adult entertainment venues .
And like his chief of staff , everybody just knows that adult access to porn or even a single Ron Jeremy Jelly SuperSoaker Dong causes children to have bad sex when they grow up and reduces your property values .
And safety in neighborhoods where they make the vile stuff ?
Maybe we should ask everyone around Mission and 14th streets how they feel about having an abandoned landmark restored , open for family oriented community events and the lights maintained and kept on at night — all because the Porn Palace ( Kink.com ) moved into the San Francisco Armory .
Until Calderon can produce proof to back his exact statements about secondary effects , it 's a bill made of crazy talk .
He has yet to produce any proof , let alone objective and verifiable studies or data to back his claims about porn making us all alcoholics ( unless you count the nights I spent trying to drink away the pain of being leg humped by a gay - for - pay porn star at the last GayVNs I attended ) .
And never mind that the porn industry already has its own industry - funded medical clinics ( the Adult Industry Medical Healthcare Foundation ) that provide medical testing , job and mental health counseling , substance abuse programs and job transitioning programs for any and all performers .
Public resources not needed , thanks .
And if you know anything about HIV tests , let me just say that porn stars get the good , expensive ones , compared to us community clinic civilians .
But Calderon 's office does n't need data when they have the lord on their side .
After her very brief career as a porn performer 15 years ago , anti-porn fundamentalist Christian preacher Shelley Lubben and her Pink Cross Foundationhave backed the bill from the beginning , and she 's been speaking and appearing with Calderon in support and to lend her expertise about the evils of pornography .
Lubben states , " A tax is justified because of the ill effects porn has on performers and consumers .
Everything from addiction to drugs or sex itself , assault , disease , rape and prostitution can be counted as side effects of the industry . "
Interestingly , a year ago I was invited to Google 's Mountain View headquarters to give a Google Tech Talk about sexual privacy .
I was supposed to speak about a week after Lubben was to give a talk appealing to Google to help save the world — and women and children and marriages — from porn .
During my talk , I took a minute to disprove her claims , but I was told by the audience that Lubben , in fact , had backed out of her appearance — once employees offered to help her gather data to back up her statements about pornography .
Calderon is calling his AB 2914 a " sin tax , " akin to alcohol and tobacco taxes .
Except that smoking actually causes cancer and will kill you , and porn causes ... masturbation .
Which , incidentally , is recommended to men for prostate health maintenance , so one could even say that masturbation — nay , using porn — prevents cancer .
It 's OK — I do n't think we 'll need to dress like pirates , raid a container ship and dump bales of " Breast In Show " into the Bay anytime soon .
The bill is unconstitutional .
Now , if they said that the money went toward saving the kittens , I think they'd be completely justified .

Men , who enjoy cycling for staying fit , may certainly benefit the environment but they may also cause serious harm to their health in case they choose the wrong bicycle .
Mr. Vinod Nargund , consultant urological surgeon from St Bartholomew 's and Homerton Hospitals in London says that cycling may provoke such problems as genital numbness , erection problems , sores and skin irritation in the groin area .
In addition , men who really like cycling a lot must be aware that they may experience changes linked to the sperm functions , which are provoked by excessive heat produced in the pelvic area .
However , scientists found no direct connection between cycling and male infertility , but they still consider that male infertility may be one of the problems linked with cycling .
It 's worth mentioning that this problem has been identified in a number of professional male cyclists , who are also at a higher risk of damaging testicles and their function .
According to Mr. Nargund , mountain bikers are at a higher risk of getting scrotal abnormalities than on - road cyclists .
" The bicycle saddle is in direct contact with the perineum and its underlying structures .
It makes contact just behind the scrotum where the nerves and blood vessels enter the back of the scrotum and penis .
This area is sensitive , with hair follicles and sweat and sebaceous glands , which are all good breeding grounds for infection .
Abrasions , chafing , damaged hair follicles and bruising are among the most traumatic cycling injuries .
Sweating in this area can also cause soreness and skin problems , " explained the scientist .
The scientist outlines that the research studies showed that over 60 percent of male cyclists had genital numbness .
" Numbness is common because the pressure of the saddle can impair the blood supply to this area and put pressure on the nerves in the penis .
This can also affect the man 's ability to get an erection .
There is a greater incidence of numbness and erectile problems in men who cycle regularly and over longer training distances .
That is why it is important to rest intermittently during prolonged and vigorous cycling , " said Mr. Nargund .
He says that it is very important to choose the right bike .
" The male cyclist should know his bicycle well and a proper fit is particularly important for high - performance cycling .
The level of pedal resistance is also very important , because riding a bike using too much resistance is a major cause of health problems in the groin area .
Cyclists can also help to ease saddle - related injuries or skin irritations by adjusting the saddle height and fore and aft position .
Padding in the saddle and shorts are also important if cyclists want to avoid saddle - related problems , " he said .

Mérida , May 24 , 2008 ( venezuelanalysis.com ) --
At a summit in Brasilia , Brazil , on Friday , 12 South American countries formally constituted the Union of South American Nations ( UNASUR ) , a regional integration initiative which began informally in 2004 .
At the Summit , Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez and Colombian President Álvaro Uribe shook hands respectfully , and Colombia remained the only country which declined to participate in the proposed South American Defense Council .
Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez described UNASUR as the culmination of the region ’s search for unity since South American independence two centuries ago .
" Only in unity will we later have , progressively , complete political , economic , cultural , scientific , technological , and military independence , " Chávez commented .
Chávez distinguished the organization ’s mission from other forms of regional integration .
“ We are talking about union , not integration , because that is a concept that grew out of the project of hegemonic neo-liberal globalization .
Later on , we developed this conscience that embraces a unitary , originary project based on the project of the Great South American Fatherland , ” he asserted .
Regarding President Uribe , with whom diplomatic relations have been strained most recently by Colombia ’s accusations that Venezuela financed Colombian insurgents , Chávez , accompanied by his daughter , expressed the “ willingness to recuperate lost trust and retake the path of cooperation . ”
The two presidents had a “ relaxed ” and “ agreeable ” conversation in which they “ ratified their willingness for peace and to respect differences , ” Chávez told the press .
Uribe kissed Chávez ’s daughter on the cheek and told her , “ Your generation must live happily , without the problems of us , the elders .
If dialogue has taught us something , it is respect for people . ”
The Colombian president also expressed hope that UNASUR would not recognize the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( FARC ) , the main guerrilla army fighting against the Colombian government , as a political organization .
The Colombian government , the main ally of the United States in the region , classifies the FARC as a terrorist group .
The temporary president of UNASUR , Chilean President Michelle Bachelet , said the new grouping will help the region “ contribute to the construction of this new 21st century , where Latin America is capable of having a strong and firm voice because we have been able to initiate a process of effective integration . ”
Bachelet highlighted the potential for UNASUR to promote economic and social development in the region .
At the top of the organization ’s agenda should be combating poverty , eradicating illiteracy , and coordinating university programs so as to facilitate the movement of professionals throughout the region , she said .
Also being contemplated is a regional citizenship .
Having successfully formed UNASUR , “ South America acquires the status of global actor , ” said the President of Brazil , Luis Inacio “ Lula ” da Silva .
Lula assured that UNASUR is open to other Latin American countries in the region , and the foundational treaty signed Friday should not be perceived as “ a finality . ”
“ Our Caribbean neighbors are invited to associate themselves with the union .
UNASUR is born in this way , open to the entire region in the spirit of diversity and pluralism , ” said the Brazilian president .
The countries that make up UNASUR are Venezuela , Colombia , Argentina ,
Bolivia , Brasil , Chile , Ecuador , Guyana , Paraguay , Peru , Surinam , and
Uruguay , encompassing a total population of 380 million inhabitants .
Lula also emphasized his administration ’s proposal to create a South American Defense Council “ founded on common values and principles such as respect for sovereignty , self - determination , territorial integrity of states , and non-intervention in internal affairs . ”
Such a council will help UNASUR members “ deepen our South American identity in the area of defense , ” Lula said , assuring that “ our armed forces are committed to the construction of peace . ”
The presidents at the summit agreed to form a commission that will come up with a proposal for the defense council within 90 days .
The countries will then meet sometime in the second half of this year to officially form the council .
Colombia was the only country that anticipated that it would not participate fully in the South American Defense Council , although it was not opposed to the creation of a working group to study the possibility .
Colombia “ cannot become part of the [ council ] , given the threats of terrorism and known derivations ” related to the country ’s four decade - old civil war , according to statements to the press by Colombian presidential spokesperson César Mauricio Velásquez .
Nonetheless , President Bachelet and others agreed it is important to proceed with the council even if all UNASUR members do not participate and that the proposal should take into account “ the preoccupations and the different emphases that each country may have . ”
The President of Ecuador , Rafael Correa , opined , “ I think we need a regional security council in order to shift from rhetoric to practice .
Let ’s not deceive ourselves ; to maintain stability in the region , and mutual respect , words are not enough . ”
Bolivia ’s President Evo Morales said about UNASUR , “ We are placing the foundation of the Union of South American Nations … Today is a day in which we , as presidents , have converted ourselves into workers , bricklayers for the construction of South American Unity . ”
“ This is a historic deed for our people , ” he added .
Morales also highlighted the multi-ethnic and multi-lingual character of UNASUR , saying , “ UNASUR is being born with the recognition of the immense contribution of our indigenous peoples , afro - descendants , mestizos , and whites , which is why we are in a plurinational state in South America . ”

High consumption of sugary beverages may increase the risk of developing Alzheimer 's disease , according to a new study conducted by the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology .
Researchers took mice that were genetically predisposed to develop Alzheimer 's - like symptoms as adults , and added a 10 percent sugar water solution to the diet of half of them .
After 25 weeks , the mice fed the sugar water had gained 17 percent more weight than the other mice .
Unlike the other mice , they had also developed insulin resistance and had higher cholesterol .
The researchers then gave all the mice tests of mental function and examined the composition of their brains .
The mice that had been given sugar water scored lower on tests of learning and memory retention .
In addition , they were found to have more than twice the amyloid plaque deposits of the mice on the normal diet .
Beta-amyloids are sticky proteins that form plaque deposits in the brains of people with Alzheimer 's disease .
The researchers said they could not be sure if the signs of Alzheimer 's were due to the sugar water per se , or simply to the obesity and diabetes , which are known to be risk factors for the disease .
But the results " highlight the potential risk of sugary beverages , " they said .
The amount of sugar water given to the mice would translate to approximately five cans of soda per day in a human .
" Although since mice have a higher metabolism , it may actually take less sugar intake in humans , " the researchers noted .
A study published in 2006 also supports a connection between obesity and Alzheimer 's , finding that the more overweight a person was , the higher their blood levels of beta-amyloids .
More than 14 million people worldwide are believed to suffer from Alzheimer 's disease , with a total of 24 million suffering from some form of dementia .
20 Things You Did n’t Know You Could Stick In Your USB Socket
When they introduced the “ Universal ” Serial Bus in 1996 , man , they were n’t kidding .
You can stick so many things into the socket it ’s only a matter of time before somebody electrocutes himself with the most erotically inappropriate “ I/ O Error ” of all time .
Hell , there ’s probably already a forum for that .
To help you forget that horrific image , have a look at these instead :
1. Your Car
Way back in 2005 , a Mazda took the phrase memory “ key ” literally , building a concept car whose ignition was triggered by a memory stick .
The car could also suck driving directions into the navigation computer and even load the radio with MP3s from the versatile starter switch .
Unfortunately the concept has n’t been seen since the Mazda Sassou was shown at the Frankfurt Motor Show – perhaps Mazda realised that making people think of their PC ( and their games ) before sitting behind the wheel of a real car was n’t such a good idea .
2. USB Eye Warmer
In an innovation that apparently escaped from a horror movie , you can now heat your eyeballs by connecting them to your PC .
Listen , Japan , if you expect people to stick electrodes over their eyes it had better be in order to render 3D images of the competitive Cheerleading Trampoline Championships .
Which is what the guy in that photo seems to be seeing .
Worse , the ability to electrocute your own eyeballs is advertised as “ relaxing ” , thereby proving that hentai is n’t the worst thing Japanese people can do with their spare time .
3. USB Pole Dancer
Some point to the Nuremburg rallies as the worst use of words by mankind .
Others to the misuse of religious texts to justify hatred and war .
But no , the words that show the absolute worst in human nature are on this website , where it tells us that the USB Pole Dancer is back “ By Popular Demand ” .
A sixty dollar gyrating barbie is back BY POPULAR DEMAND !
This thing existed , then stopped , then enough people requested them for them to start making more .
We can only imagine that the factory owner wept , took the money , and is spending every cent educating his children to get into the space program because this planet right here is fucked .
4. Steampunk Mouse
Not everything you can plug into your computer is an offense against taste and style .
A man know only as “ Unklian ” , which we presume is l33t speak for “ awesomely cool guy ” crafted a wood and brass steampunk mouse that actually works .
It ’s the ultimate accessory for a steam - processor ( we hear you can run flux capacitors on the stuff too ) , and if you think the construction takes dedication , imagine what it ’s like to use it .
Steam technology may have had many awesome mechanical properties , but ergonomy was n’t one of them .
5. The Littlest Flash Drive
ATP Electronics thought they ’d reached the ultimate point of in tiny USB drives years ago , building a 1GB so tiny that if it got any smaller it would fall out of the socket .
Doubtless triggering embarrassing flashbacks in the kind of customer who gets excited about this kind of thing .
But if there ’s one thing computer technologists excel at , it ’s pushing the envelope way past where there ’s any postal service , sanity or any reason to be there : step forward the KingMax Super Stick .
The Super Stick broke the size barrier by realising “ Hell , they do n’t need the whole USB port . ”
Psychiatric counselling after the realisation that your entire life ’s knowledge can be stored an a device smaller than your fingernail not included .
6 . The USB Bowling Ball
At the opposite end of the size , sense and sanity spectra is the USB Bowling Ball drive .
It weighs seven kilograms , meaning that to stay proportional with the Super Stick it would have to store more data than a library the size of the universe .
And the instant you connect it to your computer it will break your motherboard in half before falling on your toe .
Big AND secure !
7. Universal Swiss Army Knife
You knew it had to happen – the big red knife that has everything you need , and several odd looking things you do n’t , has upgraded electronically to include a 2 GB memory stick .
Tuned for the modern office survivor , it also includes a laser pointer , a ballpoint pen and several cutting blades .
Clearly , board meetings in the Swiss Army are significantly more exciting than ours .
But if you ca n’t see the problem with jamming an object composed of 50 % cutting edges through the coils of cyber - spaghetti that lurk behind a modern desktop , then wiggling it around to find an untaken socket , then we recommend you read the rest of this article quickly before you break your computer .
8. USB Web Server
It does exactly what the title says – a tiny memory stick which can launch a web - serving system from a USB port , and the only reason you have n’t seen this used in the movies is even Hollywood does n’t think computers can do that .
Exactly why you need to set up a site viewable by the world with only sixty seconds warning and no heavy equipment is unclear , but could involve :
a) Being on the run from the RIAA
b ) Running a guerilla porn site from historic public buildings
c ) Turning boring access - limited “ courtesy computers ” into a global network sharing Battlestar Galactica episodes .
Whichever it is , keep it up !
9. Brewster ’s Millions ( of kilobytes )
If the USB Server is a little too “ actually practical ” for you , then behold !
Compelling evidence that money should just be confiscated from some people for the public good .
Memory manufacturer
White Lake have built a three and a half thousand dollar gold and diamond memory key , and if anybody sees a problem with coating the single most losable piece of electronics in existence with four - figures worth of jewelry , White Lake sure did n’t hire them .
Other entrance requirements for the WL Design Team include an absolute lack of taste , an inability to be disgusted with profligate waste , and an IQ lower than your tax rate .
Never mind the fact that you could pay a procession of people to carry a 3.5 ″ floppy each for less .
10 . USB Hamster Wheel
If your cubicle and keyboard do n’t make you feel enough like an animal in a pointless wheel , raise the parallel to horrifying proportions with a USB hamster mocking every second of your pointless existence – paid for and powered by your own fruitless efforts !
The hamster is connected to your keyboard , runs faster the quicker you flail at the keyboard , and is the sort of thing Kafka would invent after a particularly depressing night on the absinthe .
Even worse , the site lists the item as “ sold out ” .
People are buying these , and if you need to take a minute to lose faith in the species , we understand .
Anyone who can spend fifty dollars on this testament to their own worthlessness should n’t have one .
They should have some kind of USB leash to keep them tethered to their desk and out of the way of the real humans .
11 . Laser Guided Rocket Launcher
You know how the Terminators got started ?
It ’s because of stuff like this .
“ Hey guys , let ’s build a missile launcher !
Then connect it to a computer !
Then arm it with a laser targeting system !
Then put it in a regular civilian office where it ’ll be trained to shoot at fleshy humans ! ”
It ’s the awesome but short - sighted urge to keep adding more features , whether they make any sense under the original plan or not .
In this case , the original plan being “ Let ’s build a fun and light hearted toy for the office that CAN ” T be used to blind people ! ”
We love it nevertheless …
12 . Barbie USB Drive
Do you want to permanently scar children for life ?
Look like a creepy pervert in the office ?
Or maybe just think David Lynch has n’t affected your daily computing tasks as much as he could have ?
Whichever it is you ’ll want one of these Barbie USB drives – and thanks to the miracles of capitalism you can get what you want instead of what you need ( therapy , and some kind of state - sponsored refresher course like “ Horrific Decapitation – it ’s actually a BAD thing ” )
13 . Smokeless Ashtray
In one of the most optimistic examples of advertising we ’ve ever seen , this site claims that your USB ashtray will “ Make Secret Smoking Easier ! ”
Because nothing says secrecy than a large whining fan armed with blinking LEDs hooked up to your computer and stinking of smoke .
They say it ’ll be great around the office , which is technically true if you buy one and then make the adapters you ’ll need to plug it in after returning to 1950 , the last time you were actually allowed to smoke in an office .
But may we suggest bringing back a copy of Grey ’s Sports Almanac instead – after all , what ’s the worst that could happen ?
14 . USB Aquarium
Are you easily entranced by vaguely moving objects ?
Do you have money ?
Then congratulations , you ’re either a cat with a credit card or the target market for the USB Mini Aquarium .
This device poses a puzzle – how could the designers build and market a product explicitly intended to be connected to a computer without ever hearing of “ screensavers ” .
It ’s like trying to sell a clockwork phonogram powered by an iPod connection – sort of endearingly retarded , but more retarded than endearing .
Should you know anyone with one of these , government - approved procedure is to back away slowly without using any big words which may drive them to confusion and rage .
15 . Number Locked USB Drive
More and more people are
a ) aware of the need for security for important data
b ) under the cruel illusion that their data is important
Unless you work for Social Security or something with credit card information , the average cyber - crook has about as much interest in your directory of family photos as , well , everyone else you force to look at them .
Sorry about that .
Capitalizing on this misplaced ego is the wildly misnamed “ Morse Code flash drive “ , which does n’t have a drip of dots or dashes .
It ’s just a numeric keypad which prevents your drive from being read until the correct code is entered – though how long it would take a real crook to bypass this hassle - only measure could likely be measured in seconds .
If he was blindfolded .
And drunk .
If you want real security , we recommend carrying around the KingMax super stick under your tongue , using the USB bowling ball ( utterly unpickpocketable ! ) , or relying on the sheer horror of the USB Barbie to deter thieves .
16 . The Real Thumb Drive
The thumb drive makes it official : there is some kind of dare in Japan to build a USB stick into every singe noun in existence .
We ca n’t say the USB thumb is a good deal : the humor value lasts approximately one second ( maybe one hour if you ’re a later - season Friends fan ) , while a personal USB drive is used daily .
Unless you ’re way , way too into the Saw movies we ca n’t see you enjoying this that much .
17 . Flower Pot Speakers
We told you there was a dare .
This is a true pinnacle of Japanese computer crappery – utterly pointless , only three words of english on the entire product page , and one of them is wrong .
We ’re assuming they were going for “ pot ” there , though assuming anything about the thought processes of people who ’ll build electrified fake - flower noisemakers is a risky proposition .
The stupid fake flower does n’t even dance annoyingly to our music or anything .
Sorry , Japan , but we have STANDARDS for our horrific wastes of resources , money and technology in this country !
18 . Ghost Radar
Step 1 : Find a market sector of extremely gullible people
Step 2 : Take their money
Once somebody has convinced themselves that undead spirits are flitting invisibly through the room and watching them type , getting them to believe fifty cents of LEDs agrees with them is embarrassingly easy .
We ’d like to mock this device harder , but we ’re genuinely upset we did n’t think of it first .
19 . Mini Fridge
Have you ever complained about actually having to walk from your computer to the fridge to get more million calorie sugar water ?
If so we should n’t be making it easier for you to avoid exercise as there ’s a fifty per cent chance you ’re spherical already .
But we ’ve got gadget - reporting duty to do , dammit , and we wo n’t let anything as inconsequential as your imminent heart attack get in our way !
The Brando mini fridge will keep one can cool for you at all times .
When things are heating up in Molten Core , do n’t worry about AFKing or leaving your group unbuffed – your computer will have cold refreshment ready .
( WARNING : USB toilets are not yet possible , so using this fridge only guarantees you ’ll have to get up eventually )
20 . USB Air Mask
You might know some people who could n’t live without their computer , but we doubt any of them have connected the air supply to the damn things .
This USB - powered anti-pollen mask is designed for the allergy season – you might recognise it from similar , non-electrical masks that do n’t keep you leashed to your desktop like some kind of fleshy pet of the machines .
The system even has a throttle , for when you need to breathe extra-heavily at your computer .
Just remember to clear the browser history afterwards .
For a refresher course on why entrusting your oxygen supply to a machine is a bad idea , we recommend watching 2001 or just thinking for a couple of seconds .
According to a recent court ruling , we are all subject to the provisions of the DMCA , but the government is not :
The Court of Federal Claims that first heard the case threw it out , and the new Appellate ruling upholds that decision .
The reasoning behind the decisions focuses on the US government ’s sovereign immunity , which the court describes thusly : “ The United States , as [ a ] sovereign , ‘ is immune from suit save as it consents to be sued . . . and the terms of its consent to be sued in any court define that court ’s jurisdiction to entertain the suit . ' ”
In the case of copyright law , the US has given up much of its immunity , but the government retains a few noteworthy exceptions .
The one most relevant to this case says that when a government employee is in a position to induce the use of the copyrighted material , “ [ the provision ] does not provide a Government employee a right of action ‘ where he was in a position to order , influence , or induce use of the copyrighted work by the Government . ' ”
Given that Davenport used his position as part of the relevant Air Force office to get his peers to use his software , the case fails this test .
But the court also addressed the DMCA claims made by Blueport , and its decision here is quite striking .
“ The DMCA itself contains no express waiver of sovereign immunity , ” the judge wrote , “ Indeed , the substantive prohibitions of the DMCA refer to individual persons , not the Government . ”
Thus , because sovereign immunity is not explicitly eliminated , and the phrasing of the statute does not mention organizations , the DMCA cannot be applied to the US government , even in cases where the more general immunity to copyright claims does not apply .
It appears that Congress took a “ do as we say , not as we need to do ” approach to strengthening digital copyrights .

I thought I ’d compile a list of resources for Atheist bloggers which might be useful for new members of the Atheosphere or might have been overlooked by the old ones .
Joining and utilizing these services should give you more exposure and interaction .
Of course it ’s not a magic recipe but if you have good content that fails to get noticed this should help .
Participate
This is the first and most important tip I can give you .
If you want more exposure and readers , the best thing you can do is be a part of the Atheosphere .
Do n’t assume that just by writing on your own blog people are going to flock to your brilliant writing .
Well , it might happen but it ’s going to be much more easy if you return the favour .
How do you participate ?
Just read what others have to say and then comment if you have something interesting to contribute .
Bloggers are generally delighted to receive comments , even it it ’s the occasional “ well said ” and if you seem to become a regular at someone ’s blog , they ’re bound to visit your site to see who you are and what you ’re all about .
If you want to refute , analyse or improve on what someone else said , do n’t leave it as a comment .
Trackback instead from your own blog .
Write a normal blogpost and aim a link at what someone else has written ( do n’t aim at their main blog unless you have to .
Go for the permalink . )
A trackback is sure to make the author of the original post follow it back to see what you wrote .
Finally , if you find something particularly good or interesting , do not shy from voting , sharing , redditing , digging or anywhere else he has been submitted .
Indeed , subscribe in all of these services beforehand so that it ’s easy to vote up people with interesting ideas .
Simply , do as you ’d like other to do with your posts 😉
This is the classic first stop for most atheist bloggers .
Joining the blogroll will not give you much more than visibility at the many blogs that have it displayed .
Unfortunately since technorati changed their algorithms , appearing there does not help your authority .
The Atheist Blogroll is however a resource that some of us use as a way to create or organise other services for the Atheosphere .
Many people subscribe here for their daily news reading .
By joining , you ’ll appear at the feed reader of many pairs of eyes so there ’s not reason not to .
Unfortunately lately I have n’t been able to get in contact with the admin so hopefully this is still being administered .
You should use the Carnival to give some of your most interesting posts more visibility .
Every two weeks these are compiled into a grand carnival and presented to the world .
Posts submitted to the carnival generally get around 200 views from my experience .
Not much for someone already estabilished but a nice boost for the more invisible of us 🙂
Join the Nexus and then also join the Bloggers group to find other like you .
Taking part in the forum discussions is also a great way to find blogging material to write about .
This is what I ’m doing anyway 🙂
Go there , claim your blog and grab some widgets .
Technorati is great at giving you some accurate stats about your popularity .
Many prefer the authority widget ( or bragging widget as I like to call it ) but for me the simple linkcount widget is enough and a nice way to see how many people have found your post interesting enough to link back to it .
Once you join Technorati do not forget to favorite your …well , favorite blogs .
Bloggers love when you do that and you may be rewarded in some way 😉
You can find me here .
This has only started getting more popular with the Atheists lately .
Most use it to notify about their new blogposts but it also serves as a handy public channel for quick discussions .
I ’ve had many a quick answer as well as some good notifications for events of interest .
And , hey , you ca n’t go wrong with befriending God and Satan either 😉
You can find me here and I ’ve also created a delicious tag for all the atheists in twitter .
Use it to quickly populate your contacts and then tag yourself .
You can pretty much see this on every blog nowadays and most people use it for the same reason , to have the nice little avatars of their recent visitors .
I ’ve honestly yet to find another function to it as for statistics wordpress and google analytics give me much more powerful tools and for free .
Nevertheless , that widget is quite nice as you can easily discover who reads you and perhaps find some interesting new blog from there .
Still , if you find any other great use except for the visitors widget , let me know 😉
You can find me here .
If you ’re on Facebook and like me you do n’t like to add friends you do n’t actually know , the Blog Networks should be a nice alternative to show your support for your fellow atheist bloggers .
Join , add your blog and join the network of the blogs you ’re reading meticilously .
Leave a comment and strike up a connection .
You can find the Division by Zer0 here as well as my profile .
This is the newest blog helping tool I ’ve found .
As I understand , it is quite new as well but it has some promise .
I ’ve blogged about it recently so I wo n’t repeat what I said but I think it would be a good addition to your sidebar as it ’s automated and the more Atheists that join it now that it ’s still new , the more visibility we ’ll gain in general .
You can find the Division by Zer0 here .
A nice way to get a rating for your blog .
If your blog is not already in you can add it and in due time an editor of the site will give it a rating .
It does not stop there of course as people who read you can rate and review your blog which should give you that warm fuzzy feeling .
Return the favor and then everyone is happy 🙂
You can find my profile here .
Voting Services
There ’s a bunch of Popularity services that many atheists use to improve their visibility .
You probably know most of them already but just in case , I ’m going to mention some of the more useful ones .
It is in all of our best interests to join these social networks and vote each other up .
We have 750 Atheist Blogs at the moment and if just 200 of these people were active on the voting services , the atheist voice would be hitting the headlights every day .
It is a sad fact that between all of us , we are still invisible .
I found that there is a reddit devoted to atheism just recently and it seems to be quite active .
I was n’t using reddit that much before but I started just for this .
The good thing about reddit is its usability .
A post that has the reddit buttons ( like this one * wink * wink * ) can be voted up or down just with a simple click which should make the action so painless that you have no reason not to do it .
Also , even if the buttons of reddit do not exist on the blog template , by putting the bookmarklets on your toolbar , you can vote without leaving the page either .
Do n’t forget to be bold as well .
If the article is good enough and has not been submitted , do so yourself .
Another voting system especially for Atheism .
This is quite new and still in the process of building up a readership .
It ’s not as easy to use as reddit but it is certainly less abused .
With the addition of the handy social buttons it becomes a bit of an easier process .
You may not think it but Stumbleupon can give you significant traffic if enough people vote your articles up .
The same also apply for other people who have their articles submitted .
Since stumbleupon has a limit on how many times one can submit a specific site , the page author cannot do so for every one of his articles .
This , if you read something interesting , press that “ thumbs up ” and if it ’s not there , submit it .
I do n’t know about the rest but I ’m delighted every time I see visitors coming from stumbleupon in a new article .
I always go and thank the one who submitted it 🙂
Remember that an post on stumbleupon gets more visitors depending on how many people have given it the thumbs up .
My Firefox article of one year ago got 2000 visitors in the first 2 days and I ’m still getting visitors now to it ( just because someone voted it up again recently ) .
So if you see something in there , give it the thumbs up .
Another way to help is join the network of atheists in stumbleupon .
Not only will you find many great articles from there but the more of us that are there and vote each other ’s sumbissions , the more visitors all of us get .
You can find me here .
I ’ve already written about this in depth so I wo n’t repeat it here .
I will only mention that there has been very little activity on this front and it ’s a pity .
The same things I said before about mobilizing the Atheist presence on the Internet applies here too .
Consider that the Atheist Nexus at the moment has 3000 members but the highest rated Atheist blog has had just 24 votes .
This is not strictly a bloggers resource but I consider that it has great potential to increase visibility to blog articles , including the ones that were written a while ago .
It also has the potential to make your web surfing a bit more enjoyable .
Epilogue
So here ends my little tour of the resources I use for my daily traves in the Atheosphere and beyond .
I hope that I ’ve given new bloggers some starting points and old geezers some ideas that might not have considered before .
If you have anything I have missed myself , I ’d love to hear it and perhaps update this small list .
Cheers !

The Turk
Long before Bonsai Kittens and the tourist guy , hoaxsters have been wreaking havoc on the gullible to amuse themselves and maybe gain a little notoriety .
Here are a few hoaxes that pre-date the Internet , in some cases by centuries .
There are plenty more , so perhaps a follow - up is in order – if you have any suggestions , leave them in the comments .
This might not seem so impressive in the day and age of computers , but at the time , a mechanical man who could beat anyone at chess was quite the novelty .
Wolfgang von Kempelen constructed just that .
It baffled people from 1770 until 1854 .
It was a life - sized man from the waist up , dressed in robes and a turban ( to emphasize the mystic quality , I suppose ) .
It sat with a cabinet which opened to reveal all kinds of cogs and gears and complicated - looking machinery , which were designed to hide a person sitting on a sliding seat .
The person could maneuver around in the cabinet to conceal himself as the presenter opened various cabinet doors to prove that nothing was inside but machinery .
The person inside would then use various levers to make the Turk move , pick up chess pieces and even shake his head disapprovingly at opponents trying to cheat .
The Turk defeated the likes of Benjamin Franklin and Napoleon Bonaparte .
Edgar Allan
Poe wrote an essay on it , guessing how the tricks were done , but was largely incorrect .
The Turk was lost in a fire on July 5 , 1854 .
In 1857 , the son of the Turk ’s final owner decided that since the Turk was “ deceased ” , it was time for his secrets to be revealed .
He wrote a series of articles for The Chess Monthly and exposed nearly everything .
For Sale , Cheap : The Brooklyn Bridge
The Cottingley Fairies
George Parker would sell anything that was n’t nailed down – no , wait , he sold stuff that was nailed down , too .
Cemented and bolted down , in fact .
He set up an office in New York to handle real estate deals – huge deals .
Among his offerings were the Brooklyn Bridge , the Statue of Liberty , Grant ’s Tomb , Madison Square Garden and the Metropolitan Museum of Art .
He would convince buyers that they could own a piece of history and even made some very convincing documents giving them ownership .
He is the reason the phrase “ If you believe that , I have a bridge to sell you , ” came about .
Despite all of these sales – he supposedly “ sold ” the Brooklyn Bridge twice a week – he was only convicted of fraud three times .
The Lying Stones
Tinkerbell would be pleased that these young girls believed in fairies , but perhaps would have disapproved of their methods of “ proving ” it .
Elsie Wright and Frances Griffiths were cousins .
Elsie , 16 , was a wonderful artist who worked in a photo lab and a greeting card factory .
She borrowed her dad ’s camera to take some pictures , and when they were developed , pictures of fairies happened to be in some of them .
He declared them fake , but Elsie ’s mother disagreed .
The pictures soon became public and were up for interpretation .
One of the people fooled by the prints was Sir Arthur Conan Doyle , author of the Sherlock Holmes series .
But not everyone was easily convinced .
In order to show that the fairy sightings were real , a clairvoyant was brought to Cottingley .
The idea was that if anyone else would be able to see fairies , surely a clairvoyant could .
Perhaps eager to prove just how spiritual he was , the clairvoyant said that yes , he absolutely saw the fairies , although he was not able to get any more pictures .
The whole thing remained unsolved until 1981 , when the cousins were interviewed for a magazine called The Unexplained .
They admitted they had made cut - out fairies and held them up with hatpins , and said they realized the joke had gone too far when Arthur Conan Doyle was duped .
They were embarrassed to come forth after that and decided to keep up the ruse .
However , Frances said that although the first four pictures were fakes , the fifth one ( the one on the left , above ) was real and that she and her cousin actually did see fairies .
A Professor at the University of Wurzburg in Germany was fooled by his colleagues in the 18th century .
They carved limestone into animal shapes and carved the name of God on them in various characters and hid them on a nearby mountain where Professor Beringer liked to hunt for fossils .
Beringer became convinced that the carvings were actually created by God himself .
Even when people pointed out that the limestone showed chisel marks , he held to his theory and even published a book on the stones .
His colleagues eventually came clean , but he refused to believe them and called them agnostic .
He was finally convinced when the two men testified in court that they had just wanted to discredit Beringer because he was so conceited .
Beringer pretty much ruined himself financially trying to buy up all of the copies of his ridiculous book .
The stones became known as Lügensteine , the lying stones .
Princess Caraboo
In 1817 , Princess Caraboo popped up in Almondsbury in Gloucestershire , England .
She was speaking a strange language and was wearing clothes that were n’t common to the area , so people were quite intrigued by her .
No one could understand what she was saying , but when she was offered a room at the local inn , she ate a pineapple for dinner and slept on the floor instead of in the bed .
Finally , a man who spoke Portugeuse claimed to understand her and translated for her .
She was a Princess from the island of Javasu who was kidnapped by pirates .
She escaped by jumping overboard and swimming to shore , which was how she had ended up in Almondsbury .
A woman in Bristol read about her in a newspaper and recognized her as a girl who had stayed at her lodging house not too long before .
She entertained the woman ’s daughters by speaking in her own made up language , just for fun .
Another man said that he met “ Princess Caraboo ” a couple of days before she turned up in Almondsbury , but at that time she spoke English and drank rum and ate steak ( as “ Princess Caraboo ” , she was strictly vegetarian ) .
When confronted with these stories , the Princess admitted that she was Mary Baker and came from Witheridge , Devon .

Here 's a neat trick you can carry out with the Dual class that I 've talked about many times before .
Suppose you define a function likeClearly this function has a singularity at x=0 where the division is n't defined .
But this is an example of a removable singularity because it is possible to replace this function with another that is continuous ( in fact , analytic ) everywhere and is well defined at x=0 .
We could do this simply by defining : but it'd be cool if we could automate the process .
Here 's a function that does exactly that :
As if by magic , we can now computeWe can try other functions too : So how does it work ?
Well I 've modified my usual definition ofso that it is able to divide one infinitesimal number by another :' perturbs ' the value of its argument infinitesimally so that when we pass in an argument of zero we end up evaluating our function not at zero , but somewhere infinitesimally close .
So our division by zero becomes division of infinitesimals and the above definition comes into play .
The first clause of the definition can also be viewed as an application of l'Hôpital 's rule
But it does n't solve all of our problems .
For exampledoes n't quite work .
You need two applications of l'Hôpital 's rule .
We can implement this easily with That 's fine if you know how bad your singularity is in advance .
If you do n't , you can use power series instead .
None of these methods will work for this function however :
Anyway , the fact that it does n't work for all functions does n't detract from the fact that it's a pretty approach from solving the problem when you have a fairly well behaved singularity .
I 've not actually seen anyone else use dual numbers to smooth over singularities in this way , but a few years ago I did come across something very closely related that apparently caused a little controversy in the computational geometry world .
Suppose you want to determine whether or not a point lies within a possibly non-convex and arbitrarily complicated polygon .
One algorithm is this : follow a line in any direction from the point to infinity ( though just outside the bounding box of the polygon would do ) and count how many times you cross the boundary of the polygon .
If you count an odd number of crossings you 're in the polygon , otherwise you 're outside .
It 's beautifully simple and if nobody had thought of it before it'd be worthy of publication .
But like the methods described in many computational geometry papers I 've read , this one often fails in practice .
There are at least two sources of difficulty .
Firstly , computational geometry algorithms are subject to numerical errors .
You often find yourself having to decide whether or not a point is on one side or another of a line , say , and getting inconsistent results because two different ways of computing the same thing result in different decisions being made because of rounding .
That can be fixed by using something like arbitrary precision rational arithmetic .
But even if you do this , there is still a problem .
When you follow a line from the point you 're testing you may find that it does n't simply cross one of the sides of the polygon , it may travel precisely through a vertex .
If your code is n't written carefully you may accidentally count that as zero , one or two crossings .
It 's easy to write sloppy code that gets it right most of the time , but it 's hard to work out every possible case where some kind of degeneracy might happen .
What happens if the outward ray is actually collinear with a polygon face ?
Do vertex intersections and collinearities cover everything ?
An ugly kludge is this : at the first sign of trouble , restart the algorithm but jiggle all the inputs randomly a bit .
For a large class of algorithms this will work tolerably well , depending on your definition of tolerable .
( Compare with Sard 's theorem in Morse theory . )
But it really is ugly , especially if you 've gone through the hassle of using arbitrary precision arithmetic .
But maybe you can see what 's coming ... Back in ' 94 Edelsbrunner and M√ºcke came up with the idea of deforming the geometry infinitesimally , giving their method the utterly bizarre name " Simulation of Simplicity " .
I think it took people a while to realise that they were actually doing the same thing as people doing automatic differentiation and so the whole notion of an infinitesimal perturbation left people wondering what in fact they were doing .
More seriously was this : writing robust computational geometry code that catches all of the degenerate cases is hard .
How is it that such a simple algorithm could be slotted into a sloppily written polymorphic algorithm and turn into a watertight one ?
Was everyone in computational geometry going to be put out of work ?
Luckily for the computational geometers it still takes quite a bit of work to get the details exactly right , and even when you do , the result is n't necessarily an efficient solution to the problem .
I know that when I had a messy computational geometry problem to solve when I was working on MI : 2 I just wrote code that turned a blind eye to degeneracies and aggressively pruned away anything that looked suspicious : like near zero length lines and near zero area faces .
If a stray pixel poked through somewhere that it should n't , and tweaking the tolerance did n't fix it , an artist found a way to hide it .
Sometimes beauty and elegance come second place to getting the job done on time .
This is now a mature project on GitHub !
Please submit comments / issues there .
Chances are that if you ’ve done any significant Javascript work , you ’ve run into a situation where part of the debugging process could be much improved if you just had the function call stack .
I ’m going to give you some ways of doing this with and without the popular Firebug extension and have some examples of their uses .
Without Firebug and friends ?
Using IE ?
Sometimes bad things only happen in other browsers .
Here ’s how to create / log your own stack trace .
Put this code in an accessible place in your Javascript file (s ) and call the printStackTrace ( ) function inside any function .
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 function printStackTrace ( ) { var callstack = [ ] ; var isCallstackPopulated = false ; try { i . dont .
exist += 0 ; //does n't exist - that 's the point } catch ( e ) { if ( e . stack ) { // Firefox var lines = e . stack .
split ( '
' ) ; for ( var i = 0 , len = lines .
length ; i & lt ; len ; i ++ ) { if ( lines [ i ]. match ( /^ \s * [ A - Za -z0 - 9 \- _ \ $ ] + \( / ) ) { callstack .
push ( lines [ i ] ) ; } } //Remove call to printStackTrace ( ) callstack .
shift ( ) ; isCallstackPopulated = true ; } else if ( window .
opera & amp ; & amp ; e . message ) { // Opera var lines = e . message .
split ( '
' ) ; for ( var i = 0 , len = lines .
length ; i & lt ; len ; i ++ ) { if ( lines [ i ]. match ( /^ \s * [ A - Za -z0 - 9 \- _ \ $ ] + \( / ) ) { var entry = lines [ i ] ; // Append next line also since it has the file info if ( lines [ i + 1 ] ) { entry += ' at ' + lines [ i + 1 ] ; i ++ ; } callstack .
push ( entry ) ; } } //Remove call to printStackTrace ( ) callstack .
shift ( ) ; isCallstackPopulated = true ; } } if ( ! isCallstackPopulated ) { //IE and Safari var currentFunction = arguments .
callee .
caller ; while ( currentFunction ) { var fn = currentFunction .
toString ( ) ; var fname = fn . substring ( fn .
indexOf ( & amp ; quot ; function & amp ; quot ;) + 8 , fn . indexOf ( '' ) ) || ' anonymous ' ; callstack .
push ( fname ) ; currentFunction = currentFunction .
caller ; } } output ( callstack ) ; } function output ( arr ) { // Optput however you want alert ( arr . join ( '
' ) ) ; }
It ’s ugly , but this works for the latest versions of IE , Firefox , Opera , and Safari .
Firefox and Opera give you file names and line numbers when they can , but I could n’t find a mechanism to get the same from IE and Opera .
Hopefully the inline comments describe enough of what is going on .
If not , ask :) .
Try it out
Give it a shot by clicking here .
It will run the snippet below .
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 function foo ( ) { var blah ; bar ( ' blah ' ) ; } function bar ( blah ) { // some code thing ( ) ; } function thing ( ) { if ( true ) { // your error condition here printStackTrace ( ) ; } } foo ( ) ;
You can easily get a stack trace at any time by calling console. trace ( ) in your Javascript or in the Firebug console .
Not only will it tell you which functions are on the stack , but it will include the value of each argument that was passed to each function .
This is obviously the best way to go if you are using Firefox .
Furthermore , these tools allow you to dig deeper .
Of course , we ca n’t count on them for ALL situations .
Conclusion
I hope you find this useful .
If you have any suggestions / improvements I ’d like to hear them !
Also all kidding aside , I worked pretty hard on this function , so I ’d really appreciate if you ’d help me share this with more people .
Thanks !
Olympic Gymnast Alicia Sacramone is HOT for Gold ( Photos )
U.S. Olympianis the older woman on the team .
At 20 years old , the Brown University student is the U.S. gymnastics team leader at the Beijing games .
The U.S. women took a silver medal on Wednesday after a series of missteps by key team members .
Nearly invincible China took gold and Romania captured bronze in the team event .
Things went awry for Sacramone during team finals .
She lost her balance on the beam and it carried over to floor exercise .
Officials delayed her start on the balance beam and she thinks that may have contributed to her problems .
She apologized to her teammates by saying :
" I think everything just got the best of my head .
I got nerves on the beam and carried it to the floor , too . "
The elite gymnast was born and raised in Boston and has an older brother .
She did not make the 2004 Athens team after doing poorly at Nationals that year and nearly quit the sport .
Sacramone and her band of premiere athletes will have an opportunity to win individual medals over the next few days and two will compete in the all around competition which takes place on Thursday .
Alicia and team mates Shawn Johnson and Nastia Liukin signed on as spokesmodels for CoverGirl in June 2008 , a first for U.S. Gymnasts .

From ABC :
Though there were concerns during much of last year that Iraq was heading toward civil war , Bush says that he often reiterated his confidence in U.S. “ victory ” for the sake of the troops .
“ That ’s as much to try and bolster the spirits of the people in the field as well — you ca n’t have the commander - in - chief say to a bunch of kids who are sacrificing that either it ’s not worth it or you ’re losing .
What does that do for morale ? ” Bush said .
So Bush was n’t confident of victory ?
And he did n’t say that Iraq was n’t worth it , or that we were losing , because that would hurt the morale of the troops , rather than not saying it because it was n’t true .
Kind of like saying “ I denied I had an affair because it would have hurt my wife to say otherwise . ”
No , you denied you had an affair because you did n’t have an affair .
The only person who comes up with the previous excuse is someone who knows he was lying .
So Bush is basically saying that he thought we were losing and that it was n’t worth it .
But he kept wasting our money , and letting our troops be injured and killed , so that he did n’t hurt anyone ’s feelings .
Well , that would be the feelings of the troops who survived .
George Orwell once made an important distinction between patriotism and nationalism , one that has since been elaborated upon many times by others , notably the quirky but often insightful historian John Lukacs , but that still has not caught on sufficiently , apparently , to have much of an impact on what we might call our national consciousness :
" By ‘ patriotism ’ I mean devotion to a particular place and a particular way of life , which one has no wish to force upon other people .
Patriotism is of its nature defensive , both militarily and culturally .
Nationalism , on the other hand , is inseparable from the desire for power .
The abiding purpose of every nationalist is to secure more power and prestige , not for himself but for the nation or other unity in which he has chosen to sink his own individuality . "
I rather like a simplified version of the distinction , to the effect that patriotism is love of one ’s own country or place while nationalism is hatred of or hostility toward some other country or place .
Some might also link patriotism to responsibility , in that a patriot loves his country enough to recognize and want to correct its shortcomings , while a nationalist either recognizes no faults ( and insists that anyone who does is a traitor ) or constructs elaborate justifications for whatever his or her government has done in his or her name .
One might note also that patriotism is peaceful until forced into defending oneself , while nationalism is forever spoiling for a fight .
Patriotism is an ancient emotion that most people feel about the place they call home , while nationalism is inextricably tied to the growth of the nation - state beginning in Europe around the 16th century .
It may be that we live in the twilight of the nation - state as the primary organizing principle for human beings , but judging by the evidence in the wake of the Georgian - Russian miniwar over the past week - plus , the sentiments associated with nationalism are alive and well and pretty virulent .
Nationalism requires endless enemies , and our resident nationalists seemed to relish settling on a once and future bogeyman into which they can sink their rhetorical teeth with great satisfaction , the eternal rival to America for world domination , Russia .
Now there ’s little question that there ’s a great deal of valid criticism that could be and has been made about Russia in its current manifestation under Vladimir Putin and his protégé Dmitri Medvedev .
The hope that the implosion of the communist system would lead to an enthusiastic embrace of free markets and the live - and - let - live attitude that best underpins a free society were dashed early on and have been disappointed repeatedly .
State enterprises were not distributed equitably either to the people at large or to the highest bidder , but to cronies who became oligarchs .
After the bumbling Yeltsin was succeeded by the far more competent , cold - eyed , and cold - blooded former KGB operative Putin , what emerged is an authoritarian state bolstered by oil revenues , with a strong sense of grievance and a distinctive set of regional ambitions and desire for payback against those who dissed Russia when she was weak during the 1990s .
Not very attractive .
Consequently and perhaps predictably , perhaps the most striking thing about this Russian - Georgian conflict is the extent to which it has unleashed nostalgia for the Cold War , with Russia as the easily identified , easily demonized enemy again .
From the Wall Street Journal to the Heritage Foundation to AEI to Bob Kagan writing in the Washington Post , the calls to “ do something ” about the evil Russians ’ aggressions against a valued democratic ally issued plaintively .
Not so fast .
As this Register editorial outlines briefly , it is n’t all that clear who the bad guys or aggressors were here .
Just as Georgia sees Russia as the neighborhood bully , the smaller separatist provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia see Georgia as the neighborhood bully , and for reasons rooted in history and ethnicity , among other factors , they prefer ( at least significant majorities do ) to be more closely associated with Russia , perhaps even to be part of Russia .
The timing was surprising , but the conflict was n’t .
Russia felt ( and was ) dissed when it was weak and chaotic in the 1990s , but now that it ’s waxing fat on oil money and has a canny autocrat at the helm , it ’s worrying about the “ near abroad , ” as Russian regimes have for hundreds of years .
It ’s not necessarily necessary , but Russia has always wanted only neighbors who are friendly or vassals on its border , and the prospect of a state longing to be in NATO , with Saakashvili talking constantly about eventually “ retaking ” the two provinces that have been de facto independent and allied to Russia ( which made all residents Russian citizens ) was predictably too much for Russians eager to flex their geopolitical muscles to bear .
However it started , the Russians were better prepared ( having probably war - gamed it a hundred ways ) .
However , who rules South Ossetia is hardly a core U.S. interest , so there was no sensible reason for the U.S. to intervene  and besides , it had no way to do so .
All the blustering without any concrete way to punish Russia only made Bush and McCain ( and to some extent Obama ) look silly and exposed how helpless a giant the overstretched imperial power is .
And to have the invader of Iraq moralizing about invading sovereign countries ?
I suspect Bush is so self - righteous he did n’t even notice a contradiction .
A sidelight of this war , which may portend more about the future of warfare than the familiar , 19th - century trope of a country geographically vulnerable to aggression wanting satellites , allies , or supine anti-belligerents along its borders , is the still - disputed extent to which cyber war has become part of the way countries wage war .
As early as July 20 , Georgian government Web sites were hit by distributed denial of service bot attacks designed to ( and to a great extent successfully ) force the servers to go down and be unavailable .
Is this just harassment , or is it probing to find ways to disrupt military communications and make the adversary blind on the battlefield ?
Does the fact that Georgia got some help from Estonia , target of an apparently Russian - directed cyber attack some time ago , and Google in getting sites back up and running suggest that defenses are becoming sophisticated enough to neutralize such attacks in the future ?
I suspect tentative answers will be forthcoming from people much more technologically sophisticated than I .
But there seems to be little question that attacks on the Internet in target countries will increasingly be part of warfare in the near future .
For the United States , however , the major lesson for those of us who would prefer that our country understand the lessons of Iraq and Afghanistan by developing a sense of restraint about involving ourselves in predictable and peripheral conflicts on the other side of the world is that the nationalist impulse to want to dictate the outcome of every conflict everywhere is alive and well .
From supposed right to supposed left , and perhaps most notably in the supposed center , the arrogant desire to make clear what " must " happen lest the world order fall apart was conspicuous .
I think that this tendency to be ready to be diverted from what a couple of weeks ago was supposed to be the central front against the closest to a real threat the U.S. faces  stateless terrorism capable of significant disruption leading to overreaction that spurs yet more terrorist activity  is yet another sign of inevitable imperial decline as the muscle - bound giant displays an almost complete inability to set priorities .
But that may be more wish than reality .
The nationalist impulse to seek enemies to fight ( or at least to berate ) is uncomfortably strong .
I anticipate a backlash that deters some future posturing , but I would n’t want to bet the homestead on it .
The Bush administration 's days are numbered .
That 's both a good and bad news story .
The good news is we are now less than six months away from the end of America 's longest nightmare .
The bad news is we have less than six months for congress and the courts to insure that , when these guys leave Washington on Jan 21 , 2009 , they leave behind an accurate and complete historical record .
George W. Bush , unpopular now in the extreme , comforts himself with the oft repeated hope that " history will vindicate our policies . "
Well , history can only vindicate -- or condemn -- if it has a complete historical record to work from .
And as the days tick down to the end of this administration 's reign , it has become increasingly obvious that there 's a lot they have not wanted us to know , have not allowed us to know and are highly unlikely to let us know -- unless the evidence is secured before it can be hidden behind the walls of a yet - to - be built Bush Library , spirited away by individual administration officials or -- most likely -- simply deleted or shredded .
( I know because I 've been here before . )
I 'm not going to waste the reader 's time listing all the high crimes and misdemeanors this bunch is now suspected of having committed over it 's eight years in power .
( Here 's an excellent list . )
Suffice it to say that they have made the Nixon administrations look like choir boys and girls by comparison .
But at least in case of the Nixon gang , Congress and the Supreme Court secured the relevant evidence , including the all - revealing Oval Office tapes .
And believe me , the Bushies noticed what happens when the evidence of crimes is left laying around rather than destroyed .
Nixon later said his greatest regret was not destroying those tapes when he had the chance .
Who knows ... maybe all us finger - pointers and accusers have been wrong all along .
Maybe the Bush folk actually did n't break laws at all .
Who knows ... anything is possible .
And , if that can be proven , I will be the first one to admit I was wrong .
But before I -- or history -- can reach such a conclusion , we need a complete historical record .
Unfortunately this Democratic - controlled congress is so steeped in political game - playing aimed at November elections , they are not about to engage in anything that even approaches fulfilling their constitutional obligations , vis a vie impeachment or real hearings .
But one thing Congress could and should do , and do immediately , is compile a detailed list of every document the administration has refused to turn over on the grounds of executive privilege .
Then issue individual subpoenas for each document as well as blanket subpoenas for all documents " disclosed and undisclosed , " covering specific areas of investigation ; the war , the politicization of Dept. of Justice , energy policy meetings , Katrina response , etc .
Of course , if we 've learned anything over the past couple of years it's that we cannot depend on the Democrats in Congress to show much backbone .
Which is why the courts need to get involved , and fast .
Public interest legal groups , on both the right and left , have an obligation to their own principles and to history to turn their full attentions to preserving the complete documentary history of this administration .
Groups usually on the opposite sides of issues , should join forces on this one .
They should get to federal court and make the case that this administration 's public record of either refusing to turn over documents , and refusing to testify under oath and of even destroying electronic documents ( such as five million White House emails ) establishes a prima facia case in favor of a court injunction against the destruction or removal from government offices of the following records be they physical or virtual :
All :
schedules ,
meetings and meeting notes .
official memos ,
official files ,
official emails sent and / or received from any domain .
logs , including but not limited to , phone logs , visitor logs , Secret Service logs and official aircraft logs .
employment records , including interview notes and internal memos on would - be hires .
contracts , no bid and otherwise , including , but not limited to , all related notes , memos and emails
This federal court injunction must apply , not only to the White House , but to all and each cabinet - level agencies as well as the CIA , NSA , Office of Special Operations .
( And , since it is public knowledge that Vice President , Dick Cheney , maintains his own secure document trove in his office , this injunction should make particular note of that safe as well . )
Sure , I know there are already laws against public officials removing or destroying official documents .
But relying on those laws would be a serious mistake .
This administration has shown many times that when an existing law or regulation gets in the way of their agenda , needs or schemes , the President simply issues an executive order that neuters the troublesome rule or law .
In this case all Bush would have do come early January is issue an executive order directing " all Executive Branch offices , agencies and employees to clear your files of any extraneous materials . "
Such an order would provide all the legal cover needed for wholesale document destruction .
Federal court injunctions ordering all executive branch employees , including the President and Vice President , to secure all documents , would add a layer of legal risk -- obstruction of justice -- that George could not simply wipe away with a stroke of the Presidential pen .
Look , I understand none of this legal - beagle activity is as satisfying or as sexy as a juicy public impeachment .
But , barring George or Dick being caught red-handed waterboarding Nancy Pelosi on the floor of the House , impeachment is simply not going to happen .
So , unless something else is done to secure the 8 - year documentary record of this administration -- or at least what 's left of it -- Bush , Cheney and their army of sycophant accomplices will leave office , having wiped their fingerprints clean from the longest list of suspected crimes in office in American history .
From now on when you close your eyes at night , listen and you can almost imagine you hear that sound of hundreds of industrial - strength shredders warming up .
It 's up to us to assure they are not used to between now and January to destroy the evidence needed to prove , or disprove , the suspicion that the Bush administration has been the most subversive and lawless in American history .

It is a fairly well known fact in the business community that the majority of mergers and acquisitions are a failure when it comes to increasing shareholder value , benefiting customers or any of the other metrics that are used to judge the " success " of an acquisition .
Whenever you read a news story about some startup being acquired or two large companies merging , there is a greater than 50 % chance that the resulting product or company will be of less value to customers and shareholders than if the deal had never happened .
When it comes to software company acquisitions , there are additional factors working against success that go beyond the typical laundry list of reasons that are given for why M&As usually result in failure .
With technology company acquisitions not only are there a minefield of people and financial issues that have to be dealt with , there is also the real problem of what to do about technology mismatch that often exists across different companies .
Whenever a large software company acquires a startup , the first order of business is often an attempt to move the startup 's application onto the larger company 's technology infrastructure so that it can get benefits of " economies of scale " or some other buzzword that is typically a euphemism for " we bought you so now you 're our bitches " that is not grounded in business realities .
This often requires application rewrites that have the unfortunate consequence of causing the shipped application to stagnate as all efforts are poured into recreating the same application using a different technology .
In addition , the founders of the startup typically get frustrated with what they [ rightfully ] deem as a pointless exercise and eventually move on to greener pastures .
There are a number of examples of this that have occurred in the " Web 2.0 " space as shown below
From Fred Wilson 's post We Need A New Path To Liquidity
So if you can't take a company public , how do you get out ?
M&A has been the primary answer in the web / tech sector for the past eight years .
And it 's been a great period to sell companies .
We 've sold three in the past couple years out of our Union Square Ventures portfolio , delicious , FeedBurner , and TACODA , to Yahoo ! , Google , and AOL , respectively .
Were we happy to take their money ?
Yes .
Were we happy with the outcome ?
Yes .
Were they good buys for their new owners ?
On the face of it , yes .
But if you look deeper , I wonder .
Delicious grew nicely for a while under Yahoo !'s ownership but recently the user base has fallen off pretty dramatically .
I double checked this chart in compete and alexa and they all show the dropoff .
Well , what about FeedBurner ?
Clearly Google has done a good job with that acquisition .
Well I am not sure .
I do n't see any integration between Adwords and FeedBurner yet .
I can't buy FeedBurner inventory through Google 's text ad interface .
I honestly do n't see any additional money flowing to me , the publisher of the feed , since the Google acquisition .
There 's no way to know what the rate of signup by publishers has been since the acquisition , but I wonder if it 's increased much .
And TACODA ?
I know that TACODA had an incredible fourth quarter post the acquisition by AOL , blowing way past the numbers we were projecting in our annual budget .
But in the first quarter , AOL fired Curt Viebranz , TACODA 's CEO , and many of the top members of the TACODA team are now gone from AOL .
Another acquisition messed up .
But who am I to complain ?
We got paid right ?
So sit down and shut up .
From Joshua Schachter 's comment on " How Yahoo dropped the del.icio.us ball with a pointless 3 year rewrite ( from mod_perl to PHP ) "
The writer is accidentally correct - we were told that it had to be in PHP to get ops support .
Curiously the PHP part did n't take that much time - the majority of the " business logic " is in C++ which took forever and ever to write .
I think the open question now is whether the remaining team will be able to innovate or be stuck in complicated codebase hell .
From Dennis Howlett 's article Google Sites - spoiled by usability issues
After 16 months at Google developer ’s hands , the outcome is substandard .
This is such a pity .
In its JotSpot incarnation , it was far from perfect but that did n’t matter because JotSpot was shedding light on a new way of collaborating .
Since passing into Google ’s hands , the guts have been ripped out and then re-assembled with as much Google ’ stuff ’ as they could cram in but rushed to completion .
At the very least , Google should get rid of the gadgets addition facility and rework it .
Otherwise , I sense the SMBs at which it is aimed will find the service a turn off .
Google has a real chance to differentiate itself from Microsoft - which is clearly what it wants to do , while adding significant numbers of users to its Google Apps offering .
It wo n’t do it this way because despite all the gripes around Microsoft products , the fact is Microsoft offers a more polished experience .
Until Google truly understands this , it will find it difficult to adequately compete .
In the meantime , offerings like Wetpaint and Ning have little to fear .
From Ryan Paul 's article Jaiku users flee to Twitter as a result of Google 's neglect
Unfortunately , Google has allowed Jaiku to languish and is now suffering a backlash from frustrated users who are beginning to mass - migrate to Twitter , a competing microblogging service .
Jaiku 's external feed servers , which are used by third - party Jaiku client applications , have been down frequently during the past week , often returning 504 gateway errors or nothing at all .
During the brief stints when the feed servers are operational , they have been extremely slow and often out of sync with the actual content — typically lagging by between four and 13 hours .
These problems have been noted by many users and several third - party Jaiku client application developers who discussed the problem with Ars.
Users also complain that Jaiku's IM bots and the third - party Jaiku Facebook interface are exhibiting problems as well .
When Google announced the acquisition , the company promised new features within a few months , but we have seen no evidence of any development at all .
Registration is still closed and new users can only join the site by receiving an invitation from Google .
The Jaiku developers have been completely and totally silent since the announcement of the takeover , and the official Jaiku blog — which used to have several messages a month — has had no new posts at all .
The Jaiku Team feed has also not received any posts from Jaiku developers since the acquisition .
The stories are the same except that some of the names are different .
A startup gets bought and immediately stops innovating because all their development time is being spent porting the code to a new platform .
During that time newer , more agile competitors show up and eat their lunch .
Why I find this to be such a conundrum is that when you buy a technology startup , you are primarily buying three things
customers
employees
technology
However the standard operating procedure during Web software acquisitions is to discard the technology and consequentially tick off the employees who made the product a success in the first place thus creating an exodus .
The application rewrite plus employee exodus leads to product stagnation which eventually leads to lots of pissed off customers .
Thus the entire value from the acquisition is effectively thrown away .
This is the default situation when it comes to acquisitions in the software industry .
For every successful acquisition like Google +
YouTube there are two or three that are more like Google + Dodgeball .
So if there is a startup whose product you love that you hear is being acquired by a one of the large Web companies , be happy for the founders and be sad for yourself because the product you love is likely going to become a neglected bride .
Disclaimer : I 'm an employee of a large software company that has displayed similarly counterproductive tactics when acquiring startups .
Although no examples are provided in the post above , I 'm sure some can be found from it 's history of acquisitions .
Now Playing : Dire Straits - Money For Nothing
BOSTON – People taking prescription antidepressants appear to drive worse than people who are n't taking such drugs , and depressed people on antidepressants have even more trouble concentrating and reacting behind the wheel .
These were the conclusions of a study released Sunday at the Annual Convention of the American Psychological Association .
University of North Dakota psychologists Holly Dannewitz .
PhD , and Tom Petros , PhD , recruited 60 people to participate in a driving simulation in which participants had to make a series of common driving decisions , such as reacting to brake lights , stop signs or traffic signals while being distracted by speed limit signs , pylons , animals , other cars , helicopters or bicyclists .
The simulation tested steering , concentration and scanning .
Thirty - one of the participants were taking at least one type of antidepressant while 29 control group members were taking no medications with the exception of oral contraceptives in some cases .
The group taking antidepressants was further divided into those who scored higher and lower on a test of depression .
The group taking antidepressants who reported a high number of symptoms of depression performed significantly worse than the control group on several of the driving performance tasks .
But participants who were taking antidepressants and scored in the normal range on a test to measure depression performed no differently than the non-medicated individuals .
" Individuals taking antidepressants should be aware of the possible cognitive effects as [ they ] may affect performance in social , academic and work settings , as well as driving abilities , " the researchers wrote .
" However , it appears that mood is correlated with cognitive performance , more so than medication use . "
This research is important in light of the rapid increase in the number of Americans taking antidepressants .
Americans ' use of antidepressant drugs such as Prozac , Paxil or Zoloft , nearly tripled in a decade , according to the 2004 Health United States report , issued by the National Center for Health Statistics .
Among women , one in 10 takes an antidepressant drug , according to the government .

The poster has been distributed around the local area
A wanted poster featuring Robbie Coltrane is being used by police in New Zealand to try to catch a teenage burglar who resembles the actor .
Detectives stressed the Cracker and Harry Potter star is not suspected of any crimes , but said the thief looks like a 16 - year - old version of him .
The poster has been distributed to homes in the Christchurch area of the South Island .
New Zealand law bans the publication of pictures of juvenile criminals .
Below the heading ' Wanted ' is the picture of Coltrane , underneath which are the words ' Active burglar in this neighbourhood ' .
Bicycle burglar
The text below explains that the photo is of Coltrane and continues : " Robbie Coltrane is not the burglar but imagine him aged 16 with lank greasy hair and you have the picture .
" He is 16 - years - old , lives locally , travels by bicycle and burgles houses in your street .
" He will break windows to gain entry and ransack the property targeting electronic items , cash and jewellery . "
It explains the reason for the use of the Scottish star , who the New Zealand police describe as English .
" Because of the Children and Young Persons Act 1989 Police cannot show you a picture of the 16 - year - old burglar operating in your neighbourhood , " it states .
Residents reportedly welcomed the leaflets and praised the ingenuity of the police .
Coltrane was unavailable for comment .
Are you asking yourself , “ do I need a website for my business ? ”
If your business does n’t have a website in 2020 , you ’re doing it all wrong .
No matter what you sell , you need a website to give your customers a place to go to get an idea of who you are and what you do .
When a customer can’t find you online , you can bet that they ’ll find your competitor ’s website and you ’ll lose their business .
Even if you ’re an old fashioned business owner , you have to be able to adapt to how things are done nowadays .
Today , we ’re going to tell you the top 10 reasons why EVERY business needs a website and give you a few tips on how to make one that will help you boost sales and get more meaningful leads .
We live in a digital age and not having a website will set you back , but it ’s never too late to catch up .
1. People Look At Websites First
Nearly 90 % of all customers go online before anything else to search for products and services .
Your website is the equivalent of someone finding your brick and mortar location , so if you do n’t have one , these consumers will assume that you do n’t exist .
It ’s also important to remember that people , in general , are impatient when it comes to products and services that they want .
Not too many are going to search high and low to find your company website when one of your competitors is much easier to find .
2. You Can Show What You Do
When you start building it , you can view your website as a blank slate to show your customers what it is that you do .
Display your products and services , give some background on yourself and your company , and leave your contact information so that they can get hold of you .
You can create as in - depth a website experience as you want .
Ecommerce companies do all of their business directly on their website , while more local services like plumbers or car dealerships display their products and services so that you can do some research before you contact them .
It ’s all up to you .
3. Sell Your Products
If you run a company that manufactures products , you ’d be remiss not to take advantage of customers far and wide that might want to shop with you .
Allowing on - site purchases can turn your small business into a multinational company .
Quality businesses should always display products and allow shoppers to put them in their virtual shopping cart to purchase later .
You ’re leaving money on the table if you do it any other way .
It ’s all about customer convenience .
4. Communicate With Your Customers
Giving your customers an easy way to contact you with any questions or concerns is a must on a business website .
It ’s mutually beneficial for yourself and the customers for an open line of communication to exist between you .
Unlike your physical location , your website is open for business 24 - hours per day , 7 - days per week .
Your customers can go online and shop around your site whenever they want and being able to make inquiries about products is a basic right for a paying customer .
For you , the business , your website allows you to communicate any news or updates to your customers , like changes to your hours or new products that you ’re introducing .
5. Reach Customers You Otherwise Would n’t
The internet does n’t have any boundaries , so you can use your website to attract customers from pretty much anywhere .
We ’ll discuss exactly how you can do that a little bit later , but for now , we ’ll look at the sheer facts .
People in the biggest cities and the smallest villages across the world have access to the internet .
These people will never be able to get to your brick and mortar , but they can stumble upon your website and learn about your company .
6. Saves You Time and Money
When it comes to advertising your business , having a website saves you an enormous amount of time , stress , and money .
What you might have had to take an ad out in the paper to promote before is a few mouse clicks away from being on the front page of your website .
Web hosting and custom website costs are next to nothing when you compare it to the revenue it brings in .
As you get more and more comfortable with working on the internet , you ’ll likely end up transitioning more and more of your business to your site .
It ’s just faster , cheaper , and easier to do business this way .
7. Blogging and SEO
You ’ll hear a lot of internet experts talk about the importance of content for the promotional side of your business .
Content can come in many forms , but one of the most popular is a company blog , accessed through your website .
Having a blog is a must and when you start looking around the room at your competitors , you do n’t want to be the only one without a blog .
You can use your blog to establish yourself as an expert in your field .
When you start blogging , you ’ll begin to hear more about search engine optimization , which is an important digital marketing tool for getting noticed .
The better your SEO is , the more people will be able to find you via Google search .
Your blog plays a big part in SEO , but so does the overall functionality of your website .
If your site is fast and easy to navigate , Google will reward you by ranking you farther up the SERP .
And , if you ’ve got a popular blog that discusses relevant and informative topics relating to your business , your posts will rank ahead of other similar ones .
Once you have readers , you can direct them to shop on your website .
8. It ’s Easy Now
Arguably the biggest reason to have a website these days is because it ’s so easy to build a site from scratch with website builders these days .
Builders like Wix , Squarespace , and WordPress all make it easy to select templates and drag and drop different components onto your site .
What you ’ll be left with is a professional - looking , functional , and completely unique site for your business that ’ll attract and satisfy customers for years to come .
“ Do I Need a Website ? ”
You should n’t be asking yourself , “ do I need a website ? ” , because if you look around , you ’ll notice that every reputable business has a website .
What you should be doing , however , is figuring out how to optimize your website so that it ’s better and more attractive than your competitors ’ sites .
It ’s constant work , but it pays off .

In 1968 , six years after Rachel Carson published Silent Spring - the book regarded as marking the beginning of modern environmental consciousness - a young American entomology professor at Stanford University , California , published The Population Bomb .
The tenor of Paul Ehrlich 's book echoed the revolutionary sensibility and pervasive anxiety of the time .
In it , Ehrlich and his wife , Anne , presented a neo-Malthusian scenario of imminent population explosion and ensuing disaster .
" The battle to feed all of humanity is over , " the Ehrlichs warned .
" In the 1970s and 1980s , hundreds of millions of people will starve to death in spite of any crash programmes embarked upon now .
At this late date , nothing can prevent a substantial increase in the world death rate ... "
Not surprisingly , the second part of his message - that society must find ways to limit population growth - drew howls of protest .
The left saw it as immoral , and feared that the right would use the idea of overpopulation to promote only the right kind of social or ethnic bloodlines .
The right worried that population control might limit the rights of individuals .
And virtually every one objected to the discussion of human reproduction as a condition of food and habitat as if discussing , say , a population of fruit flies .
Forty years on , the message from Ehrlich , now 76 and the Bing professor of population studies in the department of biological sciences at Stanford , has barely mellowed .
He and his wife have just published a new book , The Dominant Animal , the central theme of which is how one species , Homo sapiens , has become so powerful that it can significantly undermine the Earth 's ability to support much of life .
It is undeniably timely as we lurch from one grim realisation to another : a climate crisis , then an energy crisis , now a food crisis .
And underlying them all is the issue of population .
When Ehrlich wrote The Population Bomb , there were 3.5 billion people on Earth ; there are now 6.7 billion .
" The connections are so obvious it 's appalling that they 're not made , " he says .
" Each person we add now disproportionately impacts on the environment and life - support systems of the planet . "
There is a growing sense in the environmental movement that population will again emerge as a central component of the debate on global warming .
But it 's a discussion that 's open to distortion on one side by fringe groups who use the issue as cover for positions on race and immigration , and on another by superstitious thinking that technology will arrive to support and improve living standards for ever greater numbers of people , or that some kind of natural phenomenon - such as a disease , perhaps with a moral or spiritual component - will take the problem out of our hands entirely .
Ehrlich says : " There was a period when people saw the connections - connections that are often quite complex .
Obviously , if the US still had the 140 million people we had at the end of the second world war we would n't be dependent on foreign oil , and we'd be emitting far less carbon dioxide in the atmosphere . "
He believes that studying our cultural evolution - " where we came from , how we came to dominate the planet , and what that dominance means for our future " - is key to opening a more realistic discussion .
" It 's absolutely incomprehensible to me that we 're in a [ US ] presidential campaign and no one is discussing any of the issues in The Dominant Animal , issues that are the concern of the majority of the scientific community . "
For Ehrlich , though , the critical scalding he received for The Population Bomb and the problematic timeline of its central prediction forces him frequently to revisit and defend his ideas .
Except for some developing countries , the globe was not racked by food shortages through the 1970s because advances in farming and technology were able to sustain larger populations .
In 1968 , environmental studies was still fringe science .
The intervening years have seen not only a boom in the field , but also in the variety and breadth of the issues at hand .
" When I wrote The Population Bomb , I knew there would be a problem with climate , but I thought I 'd be dead by the time we started to worry , " Ehrlich says .
" One thing after another has come up - the biodiversity crisis , ozone depletion ... all of which means I have to know more about more things . "
Yet the issue of overpopulation and its equally thorny partner , overconsumption , remain near the centre of Ehrlich 's study .
Reiterating what environmental scientist James Lovelock stated recently , Ehrlich says : " We have grown in number to the point where our presence is perceptibly disabling the planet like a disease . "
No longer is it clear that technology , so often cited as means of maintaining growth , is n't ecologically counterproductive and fostering a population bubble that must sooner or later burst .
The charm and the curse of the population debate is that one must inevitably return to the subject of fruit flies .
When a female finds a pile of rotting bananas , she lays her eggs and the population explodes .
When the bananas are used up , the population crashes .
Some females find another pile of fruit , and the process starts over .
" Our problem is we only have one pile of bananas , " Ehrlich says .
Entrenched
The issue of consumption , Ehrlich believes , may be more thorny even than population .
So entrenched is the culture of consumption , that debate in the US tends reflexively to skip over the question of curbing domestic energy use and carbon emissions to the question of how to curb growing Indian and Chinese pollution .
" Over 50 or 60 years , we turned the US from a country for people to a country for cars , " Ehrlich argues .
" We should be spending the next 50 years reversing that . "
Part of an effective effort , Ehrlich holds , would be to add what economists call the " externalities " to the cost of energy .
With the price of petrol reaching over $ 4 ( £ 2 ) a gallon and Americans rapidly rethinking their love of huge cars , the price still does not reflect its true cost .
For example , Ehrlich says , " we do n't pay our share of the US military budget that goes to keeping the flow going , and we do n't pay for the treatment for cancers caused by the particulates from burning fossil fuels .
We do n't pay the full costs of our behaviours . "
There is cause for guarded optimism .
He says : " If you look at it historically , the rise of environmental consciousness has been extremely rapid .
We 're only 40 years into it .
The trouble is , the environment has been going downhill far faster . "

There has been considerable controversy this year over whether certain brands of bacteria - laden yogurt really help aid digestive health , but do n’t let the hullabaloo sour you on yogurt .
It ’s a bona fide superfood , and live bacterial cultures are what make it unique .
If they survive the pasteurization process , you should find the bacteria -- usually Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria -- listed on the container among the ingredients , right after milk .
Both types have long reputations as probiotics , bacteria that are beneficial to the intestinal tract and immune system .
Beyond that , yogurt is a terrific source of protein and calcium .
Many people who are otherwise lactose - intolerant can digest it .
Still , health is n’t the reason that yogurt is a staple of cuisines in the Caucasus , Balkans , Mediterranean and India .
Yogurt is wonderful to cook with , much more than a breakfast food , and this week ’s recipes will showcase a variety of dishes made with it .
Look for plain , minimally processed brands with no added gums , stabilizers or sweeteners .
I prefer low - fat to nonfat , which can be watery and sour , and may contain fewer fat - soluble vitamins .
MORGANTOWN , W.Va . -- Former West Virginia University football coach Rich Rodriguez and the University of Michigan have agreed to pay a $ 4 million buyout clause and settle a lawsuit that WVU filed after he broke his contract in December .
Rodriguez will pay $ 1.5 million in three annual payments beginning January 2010 .
The Wolverines athletic department , his new employer , will pay $ 2.5 million by the end of July and cover Rodriguez 's legal fees , the University of Michigan said in a statement .
" To help Rich focus on the challenges ahead , we have worked with him to resolve the dispute between him and West Virginia University over the terms of his buyout , " Michigan athletic director Bill Martin said .
" Although he continues to disagree with the validity of the terms , Rich and the rest of us at Michigan felt that it would be best to get this distracting issue behind us . "
The WVU Board of Governors held a special meeting Wednesday and approved the agreement , settling a case that attorneys Tom Flaherty and Jeff Wakefield were set to try this fall .
" It 's a case that should have settled a long time ago and could have settled a long time ago .
It 's in the best interest of everyone to resolve it , " Flaherty said .
WVU will be responsible for its own legal bills , which Wakefield said " will be very reasonable . "
A call to Ohio attorney Marv Robon , who represents Rodriguez , and WVU athletic director Ed Pastilong were not immediately returned .
Rodriguez 's agent , Mike Brown , declined comment .
Gov. Joe Manchin , meanwhile , issued a statement urging an end to the acrimony .
" I am happy that this seems to be coming to a conclusion and believe , as I 'm sure many other West Virginians do , that with this agreement in place , it 's now time to move on , " he said .
Rodriguez quit the Mountaineers in December for the head - coaching job at Michigan , only a year after extending his contract with WVU .
He had argued that WVU broke the contract first by failing to honor certain promises -- a charge WVU denied .
Adding pressure on Rodriguez was a lawsuit WVU filed in a Michigan court last week , asking a judge to order Martin and school president Mary Sue Coleman to testify in depositions .
A hearing on that request had been set for Wednesday afternoon .
WVU also recently got an Ohio court to issue a subpoena for testimony and records from Mike Wilcox , Rodriguez 's financial adviser .
The Rodriguez camp approached the university with a " significant and serious offer " within the past few days , and WVU responded with a counterproposal Tuesday , Flaherty said .
That set off a series of meetings with a court - appointed mediator , Frank Fragale .
WVU president Mike Garrison said he was pleased the matter was resolved .
" It was a valid contract .
We entered the contract in very good faith .
We worked very hard to create an experience here for our former coach that was a very good one , but he made a decision and I respect his decision , " Garrison said .
Garrison is stepping down as WVU 's president Sept. 1 over an unrelated scandal involving a master 's degree the university wrongly awarded to the governor 's daughter last fall .
The $ 4 million liquidated damages clause was suggested by an attorney on the WVU board of governors in December 2006 , after Rodriguez turned down an offer from Alabama .
It was double the amount of the previous contract , but a number attorney Steve Farmer said he believed would protect WVU from lost marketing , merchandising and other opportunities if Rodriguez left early .
Though Rodriguez initially balked , he ultimately signed a contract with that figure in August 2007 .
He then resigned Dec. 16 , taking recruits and assistant coaches with him , and leaving the Mountaineers just before the Fiesta Bowl game against Oklahoma .
Bill Stewart replaced Rodriguez after a 48 - 28 victory over the Sooners .
Stewart has a five - year contract worth $ 800,000 a year , plus incentives .
The base salary totals $ 4 million , the same amount WVU aimed to recover with its lawsuit .
Rodriguez testified recently in a deposition that he signed his contract under pressure from board members and Gov. Joe Manchin .
He argues that WVU failed to honor some of his demands and Garrison assured him the buyout clause would be reduced or eliminated if he were to resign -- a promise Garrison denies making .
Rodriguez also testified that while he considered the amount " excessive " and " unfair , " he acquiesced when he was told a major WVU donor had insisted on it .
WVU booster Ken Kendrick , managing general partner of the Arizona Diamondbacks , had insisted on the $ 4 million .
" I do n't think that anybody wins in litigation , " he said .
" The university needs to get on with its business and Rich Rodriguez needs to get on with his business at Michigan . "
Rodriguez has agreed to a similar $ 4 million damages clause at Michigan .
As many as 2,000 people may have been killed and 30,000 made homeless as the chaotic conflict between Georgian and Russian forces in the pro-Moscow enclave of South Ossetia entered its second bloody day .
Georgia 's parliament approved a state of war across the country for the next 15 days , while also calling for a ceasefire .
The Russian President , Dmitry Medvedev , said that there would be no talks until Georgian troops left the conflict zone .
And , in what could be a second front , Abkhazia , another pro-Russian enclave in Georgia , said its forces had begun an operation to drive out Tbilisi 's forces .
The situation on the ground in South Ossetia , most of whose population are ethnic Russians , remained highly confused .
Russia said it had seized South Ossetia 's capital , Tskhinvali , but Georgia denied this .
Russia , which sent in tanks to back the South Ossetians , said its forces had " liberated " the enclave 's capital , but Georgia responded that Tskhinvali was under its " complete control " .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
A Russian journalist said Tskhinvali had been badly damaged .
" The town is destroyed .
There are many casualties , many wounded , " Zaid Tsarnayev told Reuters .
Russian jets carried out up to five raids on mostly military targets around the Georgian town of Gori , close to the conflict zone in South Ossetia .
But some missiles went astray , killing at least a dozen people .
A woman knelt in the street and screamed over the body of a dead man , as a bombed apartment block burned nearby .
Russia said two of its warplanes had been shot down , 13 of its soldiers killed and 70 wounded .
The Georgians said the Russian jets had targeted the Baku - Tbilisi - Ceyhan pipeline that carries oil to Turkey , but had so far failed to damage it .
It was difficult to know if this was a statement of fact , or an attempt to garner sympathy and support from the West .
The casualty tolls were also much confused .
Russia 's figure of 2,000 dead and 30,000 homeless was largely supported by South Ossetian leaders , who said that about 1,400 had died there since Friday .
Georgia said only 129 people had been killed , but this is believed to refer only to the death toll for the town of Gori .
UN officials put the number of refugees from South Ossetia at between 2,400 and 5,000 .
The conflict began when Russian troops poured into South Ossetia on Friday , hours after Georgia launched an offensive aimed at restoring control over the separatist province .
In Tbilisi , people were nervous but defiant .
Most supported their leadership but had been shocked by the Russian reaction .
" To fight Russia is crazy , " said Giga Kvenetadze , 30 , a music studio owner .
" But I do support [ Georgia 's President , Mikheil ] Saakashvili .
And what Russia is doing is wrong .
They must stop . "
The war of words at the highest levels was no less intense .
Mr Saakashvili said in Tbilisi : " Russia has launched a full - scale military invasion of Georgia . "
The US President , George Bush , said Russian attacks on Georgia marked a " dangerous escalation " of the crisis and urged Moscow to halt the bombing .
In a phone call with Mr Bush , according to a Kremlin statement , Mr Medvedev " stressed that the only way out of the tragic crisis provoked by the Georgian leadership is a withdrawal by Tbilisi of its armed formations from the conflict zone " .
The Russian foreign ministry also charged that Ukraine , whose pro-Western government is seeking membership of Nato and the EU , had encouraged Georgia to carry out " ethnic cleansing " in South Ossetia .
The Russian Prime Minister , Vladimir Putin , who arrived in the North Ossetian city of Vladikavkaz last night , accused Georgia of committing " genocide " , seeking " bloody adventures " , and trying to involve other countries in a military conflict in its separatist region of South Ossetia .
" Georgia 's aspiration to join Nato ... is driven by its attempt to drag other nations and peoples into its bloody adventures , " he said .
Last night , a Western delegation was on its way to Georgia to try to broker a ceasefire .
Britain 's Secretary of State for Defence , Des Browne , announced the mission involving a group of officials from the EU , the US , Nato and the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe .
But Western powers have little influence in South Ossetia .
Moves were afoot last night for the UN Security Council to convene a second emergency meeting in two days .
But there is little sign that outside pressure can produce an end to the fighting , the bloodiest since South Ossetia won effective independence from Georgia in 1992 .
But the crisis feeds directly into the rivalry between the US and the assertive , energy - rich Russia of Vladimir Putin and his successor , Mr Medvedev .
Mr Bush has built close personal and ideological bonds with the Georgian President , strongly supporting the latter 's efforts to have his country enter Nato .

Dogs , generals , and orphans
by Connor O’Steen
One of the things we have no shortage of in Kabul is dogs .
Marnie Gustavson , the executive director of PARSA and the person who ’s been nice enough to put me up in Afghanistan , currently has seven dogs living under her roof .
Â
It was n’t exactly that she wanted this many ; it was just how it turned out , really .
One of the biggest problems I ’ve had adapting to Afghan culture isÂ its casual cruelty and neglect of animals .
Marnie even said that one of the drivers she had here would laugh while he swerved trying to hit stray dogs .
Given the situation , where children will beat and sometimes kill strays for the fun of it , the staff of PARSA has ended up rescuing a lot of animals .
A number of these have been given to ex-pats or caring Afghan families , but some are simply too stubborn or loved to be given away .
The dogs at Marastoon ( where the international staff of PARSA live ) are mainly Afghan hounds or ex-jongi ( fighting ) dogs .
The biggest jongi dog , ironically named Puppy , could easily fit my head in his jaws but actually has the best temper .
Most of the dogs have had their ears and tails cut short ; that ’s to keep other dogs from grabbing them there during a fight .
Despite all of the mischief they cause , they ’re great dogs , and another example of making a change in Afghanistan –human or animal .
We went to Alhouddin orphanage a few days ago and took along two British ISAF generals who are kind and smart enough to realize that this is an important program to fund , and who wanted to see the results of their efforts .
To emphasize how great these guys were , their money was n’t coming from any kind of ISAF budget , it was raised through fundraising projects in Britain , Dubai , and other British embassies around the world .
Through their own personal clout , they made this a priority .
ISAF generals , however , are not allowed to leave their bases without an armed convoy following them .
This is true despite the fact that in Kabul , the only target that could draw hostility is a very apparent , very slow , ISAF convoy .
By requiring extra measures of security , these ISAF regulations only serve to make the situation more dangerous for their personnel .
Fortunately , the ISAF generals agreed on this conclusion , so they snuck out in civilian clothes and the three of us climbed into the trunk of a Toyota as we dodged security .
On the ride over ( a rather bumpy one , particularly without any seats to cushion the blows of the lousy Kabul roads ) the generals and I discussed our views on the war in Afghanistan , the security situation , and what should be done to improve the quality of life for Afghans .
The big conclusion that weÂ reached is there has to be an agreement among the international community and the aid community about the consistency of aid to social and political programs in Afghanistan .
Easier said than done obviously .
It ’s not easy to solve donor fatigue or convince nations to continue to give when corruption is rampant and the results seem few .
Still , if we lose interest now and refuse to continue what we ’ve started , we have no right to be outraged when another security threat arises .
The security threats are the result of a base of social and political instability .
If you can solve the vacuum of Afghan power , you can improve the security situation , but it all takes patience and continued assistance .
The experience was surreal .
Riding in the trunk of a car with two senior staff members of ISAF and discussing aid and security policies with them - even after I ’d been told I was going to Afghanistan , I do n’t think I would ’ve believed that could have happened .
More to come .

One of the most frequently asked questions we get while speaking on social media marketing at conferences is “ How can something boring be successful in social media ? ”
Well , there is really no product , service , or topic that cannot be successful in social media marketing if you are willing to be creative .
To prove the point I have found four really boring products that rocked in social media .
Blenders – Outside of a few geeky modification articles , there was not a whole lot that had been done with the household blender in social media .
That was until “ Will It Blend ” videos ripped onto the scene .
Blendtec , a blender company , had been putting their blenders through some extreme tests to validate the quality and durability .
One employee was impressed by the tests and decided to video tape a few different tests and put them on the internet .
The result was one of the most viral campaigns to date .
Later a “ Will It Blend ” website was created and they have been blending just about every new gadget that comes out on the market , continuing to stay fresh and with the current trends .
Here is what might be the first “ Will It Blend ” video :
Taxes –
My god , taxes are about as boring of a topic as it gets .
It is topics like these that make you want to reach deep into that creative side of your brain and come up with something out of the box … like H&R Block did .
Meet Truman Greene , who is “ down with the Block . ”
Truman infiltrated social media sites like Facebook and Myspace with sites dedicate to H&R Block .
He even shot numerous videos that were published on YouTube .
Truman ’s amassed about 900 Facebook friends and over 3000 on Myspace , all connected to his pro-Block message .
Check out the “ Ode to Block ” video by Truman Greene : Milk – About the only really memorable advertising campaign that worked for milk was the various stars with their “ Got Milk ” mustaches , until White Gold came forth to rock you milk drinkers out of your seats .
White Gold , an interactive social media campaign launched by Got Milk , shows us that if your product is too boring , you can spend a ton of money and succeed in social communities .
Targeted at the teenage audience on social community pages like Myspace , Facebook , and YouTube , the White Gold campaign has amassed 1,000 ’s of friends on each site .
Some of White Gold ’s video have received almost 500,000 views , like this one :
Urinals – Bathroom fixtures are just dripping with boredom , unless you happen to be lucky enough to use one of the world ’s craziest urinals .
One very smart marketer from Germany decided to put together a post with all of the weirdest and craziest urinals from all over the world .
The result was over 5,000 Diggs after it hit the front page , http://digg.com/design/Pictures_of_the_Craziest_Urinals_From_Around_the_World
So hopefully the above examples show that no matter what you are trying to push in social media , there is a way to make your really boring topic exciting and fun .

The Gay - Talk Express strikes again .
John McCain needs to decide who he wants to be .
Two weeks ago , McCain met with gay Republican leaders ( people his staff had met with repeatedly before ) .
After the religious right flipped out , McCain then met with virulently anti-gay religious right leaders , and promised those leaders that he would be more vocally anti-gay in public in the future .
Then one week after that , McCain outfoxed those same religious right leaders by hiring a gay man to one of the most senior positions in his campaign .
Now , I think it ’s great that John McCain has such an affinity for openly gay men .
In fact , McCain has had openly gay senior staff on the Hill and in his campaigns going back to the early 90s , at least .
Again , that ’s great .
Although John McCain is still pretty bad on a lot of gay issues , having so many gay men on staff over the years has to have changed his heart , and the hearts of McCain ’s other staffers .
It ’s tough for McCain and his staff to be too anti-gay when he ’s got senior gay people permeating his entire outfit , senior people putting a face to the anti-gay policies that people like Burress are demanding that McCain promote .
Not to mention , gays leak like sieves .
The more gays McCain hires to senior positions , the more those gays are going to leak the details of anything McCain is working on that even smells of being anti-gay .
It ’s a small town , and an even smaller gay community .
People talk .
And even gay Republicans are n’t usually too willing to let people like Phil Burress do much damage .
So , while I still think that Barack Obama will do 100 times more good than John McCain for all Americans , including gay Americans , I ’m heartened that John McCain remains so committed to weaving openly gay men , and even gay activists , into the senior - most reaches of his campaign .
Regardless of what McCain promises the likes of Phil Burress , the rainbow cabal is in place , and the cabal rarely lets us down .
Editor 's note : " Glenn Beck " is on Headline News nightly at 7 and 9 ET .
Glenn Beck says a lower corporate income tax will help bring businesses to the United States .
NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
Ah , tax day .
The day that we all get together to give our money to an organization that none of us believe actually deserves it .
It 's the day we all fund thousands of services that do n't really work and that most of us will never use -- like we 're overpaying for a mediocre meal at a restaurant where we do n't even get to eat it .
It 's the day we hope and pray to regain ownership of a small percentage of our own money that was taken from us , and that somehow makes us happy .
Not surprisingly , only the threat of prison convinces us to continue to participate .
It 's a process so unpopular that even politicians , who want nothing more than to spend your money , will all act like they feel your pain .
Republicans say they will cut taxes for everyone and occasionally they do it .
Of course , they do n't combine that with a cut in spending , so it 's like they stop punching you with their left hand and continue with their right .
Democrats do n't even bother to hide their love for spending -- at least not well .
They just say all those lucky rich people and evil companies will pay the bills .
Being lucky , rich , evil and a company , I really hate tax day .
However , I 'm a little unsure which approach is better .
Democrats burst through the front door of our convenience store with a gun and tell us to empty the contents of our cash register into their little bag with the dollar signs on it .
Republicans walk through the store and smile at us while shoplifting furiously when we turn our backs .
When we catch them on surveillance cameras , they just claim they learned their lesson and wo n't do it next time .
Either way I 'm being ripped off , and both parties seem to have the attitude that we should be lucky they graced the store with their presence .
Tax day is truly the lone bipartisan day of the year .
We all hate it equally .
It 's a day that liberals can agree with Ronald Reagan , who said , " High taxes and excess spending growth created our present economic mess .
More of the same will not cure the hardship , anxiety and discouragement it has imposed on the American people . "
It is also a day when conservatives can agree with John F. Kennedy , who said , " I see no magic in tax dollars which are sent to Washington and then returned .
I abhor the waste and incompetence of large - scale federal bureaucracies .... "
So , in the spirit of bipartisanship , let me attempt one simple tax policy argument .
Lower the corporate income tax .
It 's something -- and probably the only thing -- that former GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney and Rep. Charlie Rangel , D - New York , actually agree on .
But what makes it so important is the rest of the world agrees on it , too .
In a global economy , companies can locate themselves wherever they want .
They will set up shop wherever it 's easiest to do business .
That 's also where they will pay most of their taxes and hire thousands of workers .
If you have to make the decision on where to do business , would you choose the country that , according to the Tax Foundation , features the highest corporate state and federal tax in the developed world ?
I doubt it .
The World Bank and PricewaterhouseCoopers just finished their report studying the burden that businesses face by various tax systems .
In what it calls the " ease " of paying taxes , we ranked 76th out of 178 countries overall .
That 's not good .
Unless , of course , you happen to think " good " is being significantly behind the Sudan and Rwanda .
We 're also three slots behind Palau , which is apparently a country .
Who knew ?
In fact , we 're close to 40 slots behind the two countries we 're in the middle of trying to free : Iraq and Afghanistan .
Our total tax rate , which includes all taxes paid by a company -- federal , state , property taxes , etc. -- is a literally insane 46.2 percent , ranking us behind 101 countries overall .
How do we possibly expect to compete on the global scale when Borat 's home country is 44 slots ahead of us ?
Certainly , corporate tax code is n't the only thing attracting business .
I doubt there will be a rush of corporate activity in the Sudan after this column .
But it 's important enough that around the world , the study found 65 countries have improved their tax system in the last three years alone , with the lowering of corporate income tax being the most popular improvement .
I am aware that arguing for a tax cut for companies may seem counterintuitive to some , with all the economic problems " Main Street " is feeling at the moment .
But that 's exactly why we need it so badly .
Now is not the time to chase away the companies that employ us .
Whether you agree or not with the corporate tax cut , you probably at least think you 're paying too much .
For everyone else , the U.S. Government has created a solution .

The Defcon conference is the wild and woolly version of Black Hat for the unwashed masses of hackers .
It always has its share of unusual hacks .
The oddest so far is a collaborative academic effort where medical device security researchers have figured out how to turn off someone ’s pacemaker via remote control .
They previously disclosed the paper at a conference in May .
But the larger point of the vulnerability of all wirelessly - controlled medical devices remains a hot topic here at the show in Las Vegas .
Let ’s not have a collective heart attack , at least not yet .
The people on the right side of the security fence are the ones who have figured this out so far .
But this has very serious implications for the 2.6 million people who had pacemakers installed from 1990 to 2002 ( the stats available from the researchers ) .
It also presents product liability problems for the five companies that make pace makers .
Kevin Fu , an associate professor at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst and director of the Medical Device Security Center , said that his team and researchers at the University of Washington spent two years working on the challenge .
Fu presented at Black Hat while Daniel Halperin , a graduate student at the University of Washington , presented today at Defcon .
Getting access to a pacemaker was n’t easy .
Fu ’s team had to analyze and understand pacemakers for which there was no available documentation .
Fu asked the medical device makers , explaining his cause fully , but did n’t get any help .
William H. Maisel , a doctor at Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital and Harvard Medical School , granted Fu access for the project .
Fu received an old pacemaker as the doctor installed a new one in a patient .
The team had to use complicated procedures to take apart the pacemaker and reverse engineer its processes .
Halperin said that the devices have a built - in test mechanism which turns out to be a bug that can be exploited by hackers .
There is no cryptographic key used to secure the wireless communication between the control device and the pacemaker .
A computer acts as a control mechanism for programming the pacemaker so that it can be set to deal with a patient ’s particular defribrillation needs .
Pacemakers administer small shocks to the heart to restore a regular heartbeat .
The devices have the ability to induce a fatal shock to a heart .
Fu and Halperin said they used a cheap $ 1,000 system to mimic the control mechanism .
It included a software radio , GNU radio software , and other electronics .
They could use that to eavesdrop on private data such as the identity of the patient , the doctor , the diagnosis , and the pacemaker instructions .
They figured out how to control the pacemaker with their device .
“ You can induce the test mode , drain the device battery , and turn off therapies , ” Halperin said .
Translation : you can kill the patient .
Fu said that he did n’t try the attack on other brands of pacemakers because he just needed to prove the academic point .
Halperin said , “ This is something that academics can do now .
We have to do something before the ability to mount attacks becomes easier . ”
The disclosure at Defcon was n’t particularly detailed , though the paper has all of the information on the hack .
The crowd here is mostly male , young , with plenty of shaved heads , tattoos and long hair .
The conference is a cash - only event where no pictures are allowed without consent .
It draws thousands more people from a much wider net of security researchers and hackers than the more exclusive Black Hat .
Similar wireless control mechanisms are used for administering drugs to a patient or other medical devices .
Clearly , the medical device companies have to start working on more secure devices .
Other hackers have figured out how to induce epileptic seizures in people sensitive to light conditions .
The longer I stay at the security conferences here in Las Vegas , the scarier it gets .
A 38,000 - year old bone has yielded the world ’s first complete Neanderthal mitochondrial genome sequence , offering a tantalising glimpse at the genetic changes that separate humans from Neanderthals , which split some 600 millennia ago .
The mitochondrion – a structure often dubbed the cell ’s powerhouse – contains a mere 16,565 DNA letters that code for 13 proteins , whereas the nucleus holds more than 3 billion letters that produce more than 20,000 proteins .
If DNA were to the size of a standard soccer pitch , then mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA ) would be equivalent to a small flowerbed .
For the time being therefore , the largely symbolic and technical breakthrough offers only limited insight into the evolution of humankind .
“ It ’s kind of opening the window a crack , ” says Tom Gilbert , an expert on ancient DNA at the University of Copenhagen , who was not involved in the sequencing project .
Yet the research , led by Richard Green and Svante Pääbo of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig , Germany , will pave the way for the construction and analysis of the complete Neanderthal genome .
A rough draft should be finished by the end of the year , Green told New Scientist .

No sex , please
This is not to say that such mtDNA sequences are of no use to scientists .
Previous work on shorter stretches of Neanderthal mtDNA has dated their last common ancestor with humans to about 660,000 years ago , give or take 140,000 years .
We know also that humans and Neanderthals did n’t interbreed enough to leave a mark in either genome .
The new , complete sequence firms up these conclusions .
The code also offers tantalising clues to Neanderthal life and human evolution .
When Green ’s team compared the protein - making portion of Neanderthal mtDNA to that of other primates , they found a pattern of genetic differences suggesting that either Neanderthals were evolving rapidly or that they lived in small groups , which would reduce genetic mixing .
Green and Gilbert both favour the latter interpretation because Neanderthals lived as hunter - gatherers , a lifestyle unsuited for large groups .
Evolutionary clues
One particular gene hints at a potentially important change in human evolution .
The DNA code for COX2 , a gene involved in making cellular energy , varies enough between Neanderthals and humans to change its encoded protein at four places .
The differences might affect how active the protein is , though it ’s equally likely that the mutations are a fluke of human evolution , Green says .
Moreover , other such substantive differences between human and Neanderthal genes and proteins should point the way to what makes humans unique from other primates .
“ The Neanderthal can let us know where to look for things that might be important in recent human evolution , ” Green says .
Less glamorously , the newly minted mitochondrial genome offers important technical insights into constructing and verifying far larger ancient genomes .
DNA crumbles somewhat predictably over time , and efforts to rebuild samples that are thousands of years old can introduce errors .
Based on the Neanderthal mtDNA sequence in which each letter was read 35 times on average , Green ’s team can now predict and correct potential errors in other ancient DNA sequences .
Gilbert notes that Green ’s team went to extraordinary feats to prove that the Neanderthal sequence was unsullied by the DNA of its human handlers .
Such bona fides should carry over to the complete genome , he says .
“ When they do get the genome we can rely on it – really , that what we ’re getting is Neanderthal , not human . ”

Particle physicists working with the BaBar detector at Stanford Linear Accelerator Center have discovered a new particle in the bottomonium family of “ quarkonium ” particles .
Technically it is n’t a “ new particle ” it is a previously unobserved state of particle , but when we are talking about subatomic particles , their energy states become a big deal ( and their names get very cool ) .
We are in the realms of the vanishingly small and the discovery of the lowest energy bottomonium particle may not seem very significant .
But in the world of quantum chromodynamics , this completes the long quest to find experimental evidence for this elusive meson and may help explain why there is more matter than anti-matter in the Universe …
Quarkonia are types of mesons containing two quarks : one quark and its anti-quark ( they are therefore “ colourless ” ) .
They belong to one of two families : “ bottomonium ” or “ charmonium ” .
As the names suggest , bottomonium contains a bottom quark and anti-bottom quark ; charmonium contains a charm quark and anti-charm quark .
Groups of three quarks ( interacting via the strong force ) are baryons ( i.e. protons and neutrons ) whereas groups of two quarks are mesons .
Mesons are all thought to be made from a quark - antiquark pair and are therefore of huge importance when studying why there is more matter than anti-matter in the Universe .
This is where the BaBar detector at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center ( SLAC ) , CA , comes in .
The BaBar international collaboration investigates the behaviour of particles and anti-particles during the production of the bottomonium meson ( bottom - antibottom quark pairs ) in the aim of explaining why there is an absence of anti-particles in everyday life .
For each particle of matter there exists an equivalent particle with opposite quantum characteristics , called an anti-particle .
Particle and anti-particle pairs can be created by large accumulations of energy and , conversely , when a particle meets an anti-particle they annihilate with intense blasts of energy .
At the time of the big- bang , the large accumulation of energy must have created an equal amount of particles and anti-particles .
But in everyday life we do not encounter anti-particles .
The question , therefore , is “ What has happened to the anti-particles ? ” – From the BaBar / SLAC collaboration pages .
All matter has a “ ground state ” , or the lowest energy the system is trying to attain .
As particles for instance try to reach this ground state , they lose energy , often in the form of electromagnetic radiation .
Once reached , the ground state determines the baseline at which measurements can be made for higher energy states of those particles .
And this is what the BaBar team has done , they have been able to isolate the lowest possible energy state for the bottomonium particle ( which is far from easy ) .
So what have they named the ground state of bottomonium ?
Quite simply : Î·b , pronounced “ eta- sub -b “ .
The bottomonium particle was generated during a collision between an electron and positron .
The energy generated by this collision created a bottom quark and an anti-bottom quark bound together .
At this point , the bottomonium particle was of too high an energy , but it very quickly decayed , emitting a gamma ray leaving the Î·b behind .
However , Î·b ’s are highly unstable and will quickly decay into other particles , plus they are very rare and difficult to detect .
This particular decay event only occurs once in every two or three thousand higher energy bottomonium decays , so many collisions had to be measured and a huge amount of data had to be gathered by the BaBar detector before a precise measurement of the Î·b ground state could be gained .
“ This very significant observation was made possible by the tremendous luminosity of the PEP - II accelerator and the great precision of the BaBar detector , which was so well calibrated over the BaBar experiment ’s 8 - plus years of operation .
These results were highly sought after for over 30 years and will have an important impact on our understanding of the strong interactions . ” – Hassan Jawahery , BaBar Spokesperson , University of Maryland .

Thanks to a rating in the Entertainment Software Rating Board 's database , it is n't exactly a surprise that Capcom will be rereleasing Street Fighter Alpha as PlayStation Classic through its online store .
What is surprising , however , is the amount of time that has passed since that initial spot back in January .
Today , Capcom confirmed by way of its official blog that Street Fighter Alpha will be available for purchase on the PlayStation Network this Thursday .
While the gamemaker did not reveal pricing information , original PlayStation games rereleased through the PSN typically sell for $ 5.99 .
As with other PSOne Classics , Street Fighter Alpha can be played on both the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable .
Originally released for the PS in 1995 , Street Fighter Alpha represented the first major break from the established Street Fighter 2 formula .
Most notably , the game featured a distinctive , anime - inspired art style , new animations , and a super combo attack system .
The Street Fighter franchise has been a focal point of Capcom 's recent revival of its classic franchises .
In addition to the as - yet - undated release of Street Fighter IV for the Xbox 360 and PS3 , Capcom will debut the overhauled Super Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix for Sony and Microsoft 's online storefronts later this year .
If you judge the progress of humanity by Homer Simpson , Paris Hilton , and Girls Gone Wild videos , you might conclude that our evolution has stalled — or even shifted into reverse .
Not so , scientists say .
Humans are evolving faster than ever before , picking up new genetic traits and talents that may help us survive a turbulent future .
Much remodeling has gone on since the dawn of agriculture about 10 millenniums ago .
" People who lived 10,000 years ago were much more like Neanderthals than we are like those people , " says John Hawks , a professor of anthropology at the University of Wisconsin .
" We 've changed . "
Hawks is among a growing number of scientists who are using whole - genome sequencing and other modern technologies to zero in on just how we 've changed .
Their research is helping illuminate not only how humans became what we are but also where we might be headed .
For instance , some scientists speculate that changes in human mating patterns may be contributing to the increase in autism .
Others track how humans have morphed in response to changing circumstances , including enhanced abilities to metabolize sugar and fight disease .
Some people are genetically more resistant to the HIV virus , for instance , and that trait should become more common in the future , as those people are more likely to survive and have children who are resistant .
Yet for some people , the makeover is n't big enough or fast enough .
Some parents have started using DNA testing to choose the genetic makeup of their children , rejecting embryos with inherited flaws or embracing those with desired traits — such as being the right sex .
New mutations .
Until recently , anthropologists thought that human evolution had slowed down .
But last December , Hawks reported that it has actually accelerated 100 - fold in the past 5,000 to 10,000 years .
He figured that out by comparing chunks of DNA among 269 people from around the world .
Over time , DNA accumulates random mutations , just as the front of a white T - shirt tends to accumulate spots .
The bigger the chunks of DNA without random spots , the more recently it had been minted .
Using this system , Hawks concluded that recent genetic changes account for about 7 percent of the human genome .
Much of the increase , he says , has been fueled by the growth of the world 's population , which has expanded by a factor of 1,000 over the past 10,000 years .
Having more people increases the odds of mutations .
At the same time , the human genome has been scrambling to adapt to a rapidly changing world — 11,000 years ago , nobody farmed , nobody milked domesticated animals , and nobody lived in a city .
People with a mutation that aided survival were more likely to thrive , reproduce , and pass that mutation along to offspring .
For example , the capacity to digest lactose , the sugar in milk , has become common only over the past 3,000 years .
Now , about 95 percent of the people in northern Germany have the mutation , which also popped up independently among the Masai in Africa and the Lapps in Finland .
Hawks says : " This is really rapid evolution . "
Humans will continue to change to cope with new diseases , if history is any guide .
Genes that defend against infectious disease have been among the most rapidly evolving parts of the human genome .
People whose ancestors lived in European cities are more likely to have some resistance to smallpox , while people in sub-Saharan Africa are more likely to be genetically resistant to malaria .
Just weeks ago , researchers reported that one genetic variant that protects against malaria also makes people more susceptible to AIDS , a discovery that could lead to tailored treatment for AIDS in Africa .
Right now , our genes are playing catch - up against modern scourges — like diabetes .
Native Americans and Polynesians , whose cultures only recently adopted a European - style diet of refined grains , have the world 's highest rates of diabetes .
The theory is that the " thrifty genes " that helped those groups survive famines have n't had time to adapt to the glucose spikes caused by eating starchy food .
" How we move sugars around and how we burn them has really changed a lot , " says Gregory Wray , an evolutionary biologist at Duke University .
It 's even possible that very recent changes in society and the workplace could underpin the recent rise in cases of autism .
Simon Baron - Cohen , director of the Autism Research Centre at the University of Cambridge , was struck by how many of the parents of children with autism who he tested were really good " systematizers " — people who understand the world according to rules or laws .
They also were more likely to have a father who worked in engineering .
He wonders if the increase in autism diagnoses could be partly due to " assortative mating " — that is , people picking mates like themselves .
People with autism spectrum disorder are often detail oriented and analytical , and today they might have an easier time finding a spouse with similar abilities than they would have in past eras .
Baron - Cohen notes that in the late 1950s , only 2 percent of the undergraduates at Massachusetts Institute of Technology were women ; now , 50 percent are .
So , he 's setting up a study to test whether assortative mating among people with a genetic predisposition for autism could be fueling the birth of more children with autism .
The human brain , which has evolved into a cognitive machine unique in the world , is likely to change even more in the future .
Our niche in nature , says Stephen Pinker , an experimental psychologist at Harvard University who studies the evolution of language and the mind , is the " cognitive niche . "
In research published last year , Wray identified genes that control glucose metabolism in the brain as among those most recently evolved .
Those changes may have been essential to fueling the human brain 's growth to a size twice that of our nearest cousin , the chimpanzee .
" If you make a big brain , it 's an energy hog , " Wray says .
" It 's like putting a V - 8 engine in a tiny little car . "
It could also help explain why chimpanzees do n't get diabetes , while humans do .
Tinkering .
Take that souped - up brain and put it in the texting , Twittering , 24 - 7 world we 've recently created for ourselves , and it 's easy to imagine that we will become superspeedy multitaskers — or more complacent cubicle dwellers .
However , this progress comes too slowly for some .
" The world is changing so rapidly that biological evolution is not where the action is , " says Nick Bostrom , a professor at the University of Oxford and cofounder of the World Transhumanist Association , which seeks to use science to improve humankind .
He , for one , does n't care to wait through a few hundred generations for improvements .
Genetic engineering will help short term , he says , and then nanotechnology will step in , altering the biochemistry of the human body at the flip of a switch .
" If we 're thinking several hundred years out , then much more radical intervention may be feasible . "
Unfortunately for those like Bostrom , who see humans as one big fixer - upper project , the human genome has so far proved to be remarkably resistant to tinkering .
Since 1990 , when gene therapy was first tested in humans , doctors have been trying to repair defective genes by injecting healthy ones .
The method has shown only limited success and has failed to deliver as a treatment for common conditions such as heart disease .
And gene therapy fixes only somatic genes , which are n't inherited .
Germline therapy , which would create heritable mutations , is a far more complex — and contentious — challenge .
Notwithstanding the obstacles , Bostrom 's wish list for improved human traits includes a longer " health span , " with fewer years of human life spent struggling against cancer , heart disease , and dementia .
Enhanced cognitive abilities would be nice , too .
" Perhaps physical attractiveness would be a popular trait , " he says .
There 's as yet no way to select for attractiveness , but parents can choose a few of an offspring 's genes if they 're willing to try preimplantation genetic diagnosis .
In PGD , doctors carefully vacuum a single cell from a 3 - day - old embryo and test certain genes before deciding whether to place the embryo into a woman 's uterus .
The technique , which must be used in combination with in vitro fertilization , was invented almost 20 years ago as a way to reduce the odds of a child inheriting a deadly genetic disorder , such as Tay - Sachs .
It did n't take long for prospective parents to realize that the same method could be use to sort embryos for other reasons .
Since 2000 , parents have been able to use PGD to choose an embryo's tissue type , so that the ensuing child could serve as a stem cell or bone marrow donor to a sick sibling .
More recently , a few have used PGD to reject embryos that have genes that merely increase the risk of disease in adulthood , such as the BRCA breast cancer genes .
A few parents with disabilities such as deafness have used PGD to choose a deaf child .
And PGD is increasingly used to reject embryos that have no problems at all — unless you consider being the wrong sex a problem .
A number of fertility clinics in the United States advertise PGD to parents who want to be guaranteed the child will have the sex they choose .
One California clinic boasts of " over 3,800 cases : 100 percent sex selection success . "
With PGD largely unregulated in the United States , it does n't take a Nobel Prize in genetics to imagine that babies could soon be ordered up in custom sizes and colors , like a Mini Cooper .
The next step : children with genes from three parents .
In the late 1990s , IVF clinics started injecting cytoplasm from younger women 's eggs into those of older women , in an effort to increase the odds of pregnancy .
About 30 babies have been born worldwide as a result , and those children carry genes from both women .
But that rejiggering of the human germline was almost inadvertent .
Scientists are now intentionally making that mix .
Earlier this year , researchers at Newcastle University in England deliberately created human embryos that had DNA from one father and two mothers , in order to avoid the risk of a mitochondrial disease from the original mother .

STATE governments across the country are reeling from the effects of the current economic downturn .
New York , facing a $ 26.2 billion deficit over the next three years , is particularly hard hit .
Like most other states , it is looking to balance its budget mainly by cutting spending .
But if history is a guide , governors and legislators across the country will seek to avoid the difficult choices that are required .
Instead , they will likely pass the costs of the services that we enjoy today on to our children and grandchildren , through creatively deceptive budgeting .
This is a time - honored practice .
In 1991 , the State of New York sold Attica prison to none other than itself .
The buyer was a state agency that financed the $ 200 million purchase price by issuing bonds .
The agency then leased the prison back to the state , with the lease payments being equal to the debt service on the bonds .
In substance , of course , the transaction was nothing more than a borrowing arrangement  the equivalent of borrowing $ 200 million from the buyers of the bonds .
Nevertheless , the state booked the entire sale price as revenue for the year .
The previous year , the state sold the Cross Westchester Expressway to the New York Thruway Authority  in other words , to itself .

In an interesting twist , his sentence was a surprisingly light 5.5 years , and since he has already been incarcerated for 5 years , he ’s eligible for release in 6 months .
Who wants to bet we ’ll find some excuse to not release him ?

This morning at 7:42 EDT , the Hubble Space Telescope completed it ’s 100,000th orbit around the Earth .
That ’s about 4.38 billion kilometers ( 2.72 billion miles ) , as it clicks along at 8 km per second ( 5 miles / s ) , orbiting Earth once every 90 minutes .
Hubble ’s been in orbit for over 18 years now , since its launch on the space shuttle Discovery on April 24 , 1990 .
To commemorate occasion , scientists at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore , Md. , released a special image taken with Hubble ’s Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 of a nebula near the star cluster NGC 2074 ( upper , left ) , showing a dazzling region of celestial birth and renewal .
And soon , Hubble will have a little renewal of its own , with the upcoming fifth and final servicing mission in October .
In preparation for the STS - 125 servicing mission to Hubble , on Friday engineers mated the external tank ( ET - 127 ) to the two solid rocket boosters .
Things are going well with getting Atlantis ready to go , and NASA is looking at actually moving up the launch date for the mission a few days , from the currently scheduled October 8 to October 2 .
Read more about the mission here , and interviews with the seven astronauts who will be part of the mission are available to read on that page , or you can watch them on NASA TV this week .
The above image released today shows a firestorm of raw stellar creation , perhaps triggered by a nearby supernova explosion .
It lies about 170,000 light - years away near the Tarantula nebula , one of the most active star - forming regions in our Local Group of galaxies .
This representative color image was taken just yesterday on August 10 , 2008 .
Red shows emission from sulfur atoms , green from glowing hydrogen , and blue from glowing oxygen .
Hubble remains in orbit without any fuel ; it just uses its speed and Earth ’s gravity to maintain its circular orbit , and gyroscopes to maintain the correct attitude .
The astronauts on Atlantis will make one final mechanic ’s check to replace worn gyroscopes , batteries and a fine guidance sensor and to install new instruments to extend Hubble ’s vision .
These include a new Wide Field Camera 3 and a Cosmic Origins Spectrograph , to observe the light put out by extremely faint , far - away quasars .
Hubble has been an incredible spacecraft that has changed our view of the universe .
Happy 100,000th orbit Hubble !

Using Emacs - the good and the bad
Introduction
Emacs , for those who are not familiar with it , is a text editor .
At least that is true at the very simplest level .
It is actually much more than that .
But most commonly it is used as a text editor .
It supports modes for a great variety of programming languages , and has an awesome number of editing features .
Beyond text editing it also incorporates an email client , web browser , calendar , a number of games , and a host of other miscellaneous features .
It can be found most commonly on Unix and Linux , but there are implementations for Windows and more recently , for Mac OS .
It has its advocates , and its detractors and having been in both camps it occurred to me to examine why emacs is popular , and why it is so hard to learn , ( which is primarily why it has its detractors ) .
Having looked at that I want to see if it is possible to keep the good features while making it simpler to learn , and thereby getting the best of both worlds .
At this point I should probably admit that I ’m writing this using Emacs on Linux , and by any measure I qualify as a power user .
I ’ve been using emacs now for about 18 months and so have a grasp of its basic use , though I use it exclusively as a text editor and steer clear of its other functionalities .
I should probably also point out that I ’m writing the raw HTML by hand so I ’m hardly Joe Public .
Firstly , perhaps a bit of history .
Emacs was written , and is still maintained by Richard Stallman , founder of the Free Software Foundation .
At the time it was written , many users of Unix were still using the command line as their dominant interface , over telnet and the like .
For this reason emacs works without any difficulty in a purely character based environment .
Because of this heritage emacs works excellently without a mouse , and makes brilliant use of the keyboard .
It also does not use pop -up dialogs , or other GUI features simply because , in the world in which it grew up , these things did not exist .
The strange thing about this is , that as a day to day user this actually makes usability better once you ’ve been through the pain of learning how to use it .
More recently though Emacs has gained support for X , and does now sport a menu bar at the top of its window .
It supports use of the mouse for moving the cursor , and selection .
It also supports ( at least on Unix and Linux ) the rather unusual copy and paste mechanisms common on those platforms which are worthy of a separate discussion in another essay .
Emacs then owes much to its limited environment .
As a daily user I feel it is much better for it .
But that is also part of its problem .
Because it has such a different heritage from text editors on Windows and Mac OS it has used some very different idioms for things like searching ( or “ Find ” if you prefer ) , and cut and paste .
Emacs ’ solutions are , I feel , superior for the frequent user but make the transition from other platforms much harder .
Once you understand those idioms emacs is excellent but learning them is a painful process .
It is this , primarily I believe , that gets emacs its detractors .
Especially when used outside the windowing environment , via telnet for example , emacs is frightening to the uninitiated user .
The first few times I used it getting out and back to the command line was a major undertaking .
As it happens holding down Control and typing XC will do this , but how was I to know .
Emacs does actually tell you this when it starts up , but the message disappears after a little while , and will go away as soon as you hit a key .
It naively expects people will read its helpful mini-intro .
Back in the real world people do n’t do this .
This instantly makes it unpopular since the user gets a feeling of impotence , not knowing how to do the simplest operation .
Emacs Idioms
Buffers
In emacs text is loaded from a file into what emacs calls a buffer .
Emacs can work on many files simultaneously , each file loaded into its own buffer .
The user can switch between buffers , copy text from one to another , compare buffers with each other , or with files and so forth .
Emacs also supports what it calls windows ( to most other people they ’d be called frames I guess ) .
It can split its display so that it shows one buffer in each window , or simply different parts of the same buffer .
This allows for similar functionality to using multiple windows or MDI under Windows .
I ’m constantly using multiple buffers , and generally keep a copy of emacs open all the time .
Clearly , the way in which emacs handles multiple buffers is harder to use than most Windows editors ( those than can ! ) , but it does have the advantage of being very lean on display space .
For an experienced user , this is an advantage .
The other advantage is that there is no need to use the mouse .
Many Windows users will claim that is no advantage , but when it comes to making editing text a fast and fluid process keeping your hands on the keyboard is the trick .
There is a very nice feature of emacs concerning buffers .
If you try to open a file that does not exist , it lets you .
It just displays a little message at the bottom of the screen saying “ ( New File ) ” .
No hassle , no “ File not found ” , it just gets on with it .
If you were expecting there to be a file and there was n’t , you get to create it instantly .
This is subtle , unobtrusive , but helpful .
It ’s pretty obvious that the file does not exist because you get an empty file , and that encourages you to quickly look to see why .
This sort of zero aggression interface is typical of emacs .
Another nice feature is auto - saving .
This might seem a pretty run of the mill feature , but , as is typical of emacs there are understated subtleties waiting to be discovered .
Recently I was editing a web page and I killed ( roughly speaking , emacs ’ equivalent of cut ) a large fraction of the document .
Emacs displayed a brief message saying something to the effect that I ’d just deleted a large piece of text and because of that it had disabled auto - save .
It did this to make sure that should I want that piece of text back I had the option .
This was in addition to the standard undo facility .
The reasoning being that should emacs or the operating system crash , it would do least harm that way .
Now that is considerate software !
That is looking out for me .
It ’s little touches like that that make emacs a joy to use .
Of course if emacs had crashed and I ’d not seen the message I ’d just have noticed that I ’d got a big chunk of deleted text back , but it ’s very easy to delete it again , it ’s hard to retype .
For anyone who ’s had to retype any quantity of anything this is a great way to win friends .
Key - bindings
Once a file has been loaded into a buffer editing can begin .
Because emacs can be driven wholly by the keyboard learning the keyboard commands is essential .
Most commands are introduced by control key combinations .
The commonly used ones are simple patterns , and have simple mnemonics .
More obscure commands have appropriately more obscure key strokes .
Emacs uses the word key - bindings because the connection between a key combination and a specific command is simply a configuration option .
Key - bindings can be changed .
I do n’t actually know of anyone who does this , but in principle it ’s possible .
I have heard that the Windows version of emacs does have an alternate Key - bindings set that are more “ PC like ” though .
What is more important though is it means that new modules ( or modes in emacs parlance ) can bind keys to their functions very easily , and this is very common .
For example I use a version control system CVS , and emacs has a mode or module so I can control this without leaving emacs .
To do this it adds a few commands into the vocabulary and “ binds ” some keystrokes to those commands .
The problem with key combinations though is how do you learn them .
The mini - intro that emacs shows when it starts does tell you how to launch help and get the tutorial .
But who reads the mini-intro ?
If you do then you can find the tutorial which will get you started , but learning emacs is not easy .
There is no simple “ pedagogic command vector ” , to steal a phrase from Alan Cooper .
I ’ll return to this point shortly .
First though I ’d like to go through a few of the simpler key - bindings that emacs uses .
On some early command line systems the cursor keys are not present and so control key combinations echo these functions .
Here it ’s worth explaining emacs ’ own notation for commands .
C- means hold down Control while pressing a key , so C-x means Control X. C-x C-c for example means Control X followed by Control C and is the command to quit emacs .
M- is the same for the Meta key ( on PCs this is typically the Alt key , many Unix workstations have a dedicated meta key ) .
The simplest key - bindings then are the ones to move around the document .
( Strictly the simplest ones are actually the ones that insert characters into your file , but let ’s not quibble ! )
Key - binding Function Key- binding Function C-f move forward one character M-f move forward one word C - b move backwards one character M - b move backwards one word C - n move down one line ( next line ) C - v move down one screenful C - p move up one line ( previous line ) M-v move up one screenful Backspace delete to the left M - Backspace delete word to the left C-d delete to the right M-d delete word to the right C-e move to end of line M-e move to end of paragraph C - a move to start of line M - a move to start of paragraph
I ’ve put two Key - bindings on each row to highlight the similarity ( or lack of ) in the key - bindings for similar commands .
In emacs this sort of logic is very common ( programmers find this sort of thing elegant , and I agree with them ) .
Note that moving forward one character is C-f while forward one word is M - f .
The Meta key is doing the same , only more so !
This is true for C - b / M-b , C-d / M-d as well .
It ’s a shame that M-p and M -n are n’t used instead of C-v and M -v for moving up and down one screenful .
As it happens these combinations are unbound ( ie do nothing ) .
That ’s just bad , but of course , you can always rebind them !
The other one to notice though is Backspace .
It does what you ’d expect .
But to delete a word you would use M - Backspace , even though you do n’t use C - Backspace to delete a single character .
This is as it should be .
If you had to use C - Backspace for one character life would be infuriating , it ’s such a common thing to do it deserves a single keystroke , but maintaining the consistency of using a Meta key combination to do the delete - word is simple and guess - able ( in fact I guessed it while writing this paragraph ! ) .
Consistency in this case would be overbearing .
Inconsistency is a neat breaking of the rules .
The last two lines of the table show C-e and C - a and their meta variants .
These meta variants might not be obvious from what ’s gone before , but they are not exactly a surprise either .
There are a couple of criticisms worth mentioning at this point .
One , is the keys used for forwards , backwards , next line , and previous line .
While these are easy to remember , f for forwards , b for back and so on , they are not convenient to use .
It would be better if the keys used were arranged in some pattern on the keyboard , say , I , J , K and M .
Once these keys are used often , and navigation is a common activity , remembering is not a problem .
It ’s worth making a sacrifice in learning here for the sake of improved long term comfort of use ( I ’m deliberately avoiding the term “ ease of use ” since it is somewhat overloaded ) .
The other point is the exact action of the next word / previous word movements .
A friend pointed out that forward word actually moves the cursor to the character after the current word .
This is rarely what you want .
It means that you have to jump a few words forwards and then move a character or two to get to exactly where you want .
In my experience this is very common .
Forward word should place the cursor at the beginning of the next word .
This would leave the cursor in the right place for operations on that word , say deleting it using M-d ( delete word to the right ) .
Because the implementation of this is not like this the users ’ confidence in using the forward / backwards word movements is reduced because it never quite does what they want .
Now that cursor keys are common there are some new bindings
Key - binding Function C- right or M - right move forward one word C - left or M - left move backwards one word C - up move up one paragraph C - down move down one paragraph M- up -- Unbound -- M-down -- Unbound --
M - left and M - right behave in a reasonable fashion , though it ’s a little strange that C - left and C - right do the same thing .
That ’s not a bad thing though .
C- up as up one paragraph is reasonable , but it ’s still a shame that M-up is unbound , I feel a little cheated there !
The beauty of the default emacs keystrokes is in their logic , with a few notable exceptions .
Many other key strokes also have their own little logics that help in remembering them .
I suspect , though I have no proof , that these were not all original parts of emacs , but have been added , rebound , moved , and generally fiddled with over time to make something that is comfortable to use .
It ’s like a building that ’s been lovingly altered by a DIY expert .
It fits well .
I ’m sorely tempted to make my own little changes to fix those “ defects ” mentioned above with respect to the M-p and M - up not being bound for example .
That ’s exactly what has made it good I suspect .
This follows a philosophy I discovered in Stewart Brand ’s book How Buildings Learn , which talks about how buildings are often best improved by the people who live in them , and therefore really understand them .
There is naturally a large scope here for individual preference as well , but that is a complex subject in its own right and is probably better dealt with in an essay of its own .
Of course this evolution and constant improvement would not be possible outside the free software or open - source communities , which is a loss to everyone .
How do we make this possible in commercial software ?
I leave that as an exercise for the reader .
Something that ’s worth adding , is why , now that emacs can reliably expect to find cursor keys available , should it still support the old key - bindings to move around documents ?
There are two main reasons for this .
Firstly , what is the point in removing the old ones ?
People know them , so why hurt those people .
The second though , and more important reason for new users is it ’s faster to use the C-n and C - p on occasion .
That ’s not to say that the cursor keys are not useful , I use them for most of my moving round the document .
However , I find that when doing repetitive edits to a document it ’s quicker to use C -n rather than the down cursor simply because it means that I do n’t have to move my fingers from the home keys .
I can work about 3 - 4 times faster that way , and I do n’t really touch type , for touch typists I suspect the improvement is even greater .
What this suggests of course is that the keyboard is badly designed for computer use , but then given it was designed for mechanical typewriters before the concept of cursor keys was even thought of this is hardly a surprise .
But emacs counters the deficiency of the keyboard admirably .
Once day I ’ll treat myself to a Maltron keyboard and maybe then I ’ll stop using C-n !
The nice thing about supporting both cursors and the other key - bindings though is that it costs nothing in the interface .
If you do n’t want to know , you never have to , and it never bothers you .
But if you do know you can work more effectively .
The minibuffer
The last major idiom I want to talk about is the minibuffer .
At the bottom of the emacs window is a reverse - video ( ie inverted colour ) , line known as the mode - line , and directly below that is a blank line , which apparently serves no purpose .
In fact it is a very important part of the interface .
This is the minibuffer .
Earlier I mentioned that when you try to load a non-existent file it will create a file and put up a little message “ ( New File ) ” .
That message goes in the minibuffer .
But there ’s more to it than that .
The minibuffer does not only give the user feedback on what emacs is doing , though it is commonly used for that .
It also acts as a scratch area for interactive commands .
The best example is the “ search ” command , which is brilliantly elegant .
C-s starts a forwards search .
On pressing it the minibuffer displays a prompt “ I - search : ” ( interactive search ) .
Now you can start to type what it is you want to search for in the buffer .
This appears after the prompt .
But the great feature is that as you type the first letter emacs jumps to the next occurrence of that letter it can find .
As you type a second letter it jumps to find those two letters , and so on .
This way you can easily get away with typing the shortest search string possible to find your quarry .
Having found the string you can search for later occurrence by simply typing C-s again .
Pressing backspace reverses back through the various matches the search found .
If however there are no instances of the word you ’re looking for the minibuffer shows “ Failing I - search : foo ” where foo is the word you ’ve searched for .
There are no error messages , no interference , and in fact no need to look at the minibuffer at all .
A simple beep tells you if the search fails ( I ’d prefer something a little less grating , but some things are n’t too important ! ) .
Pressing return finishes the search leaving the cursor wherever it ’s got to , and a “ mark ” where the search started .
The mark allows you to return to the start of the search with another key combination C-x C-x .
The I - search , once learnt is a very simple and flexible tool .
While it is very different from normal find methods found in most tools it is a very valid approach , sadly underused .
It is the minibuffer that makes this possible .
A simpler example of the minibuffer , this time just as a informational area is saving a file .
C-x C-s saves the current buffer .
Since buffers are always associated with filenames there is no need to ask for a filename .
Emacs saves the file and displays “ Wrote foo.html ” in the minibuffer .
A variant allow you to save with a different filename ( like Save As ... ) , C-x C-w , this time the filename is asked for in the minibuffer .
Once saved acknowledgement is given in the minibuffer .
This sort of assurance is excellent .
What makes it vastly better than a dialog box is that it does need to be dismissed .
It simply gets displayed .
If you want to read it you can , if not , just ignore it .
It wo n’t bother you .
This low overhead interaction is exactly what is required in more applications , and emacs wins again by making it serve double duty as an input and an output field .
[
Incidentally , if you think C-x C-w is a strange key - binding for Save As , remember that C-x C-s is save , and then look at your keyboard and note where the X , S and W keys are .
Pretty is n’t it ! ]
The down - side
Learning emacs is painful
So far I ’ve been pretty positive about emacs , and not really said anything of substance against it .
I find it an excellent tool , but it was n’t always thus .
Emacs is hard work to learn .
In title Alan Cooper introduces the idea of Pedagogic Command Vectors .
Simply put , a pedagogic vector is a part of the interface which helps teach new users what functionality is available and introduces them gently to some of the other command vectors .
In typical Windows programs the menu is a classic example .
You can scan the menus to see what the program does , and many menu items tell you what the keyboard shortcut is ( in fact all those where such shortcuts exist ) .
Emacs is very poor at this .
If you run emacs under X you do at least get a menu bar , but it is by no means complete .
This is no great surprise since emacs has roughly 650 functions in the version I ’m using now .
That many functions do n’t sit neatly on menus .
However , the menus do n’t even include a reasonable working set .
What ’s worse , they do n’t always have the keyboard equivalent marked .
On the Files menu there is an entry for killing the current buffer ( there ’s a buffer menu too , so why is this entry not on that ? ) .
However , I have never seen , on any version of emacs I ’ve ever used , that entry have its key - binding displayed .
The Key binding is “ C - x k ” , but you ’d never know .
As a teacher the menus are not very helpful .
The closest emacs gets to a pedagogic command vector is its command set .
By typing M-x you can enter emacs commands directly by name .
Everything emacs can do is implemented by a command , so this is a powerful way of doing things .
For example , if you want to run the tetris game ( believe me , there is one ! ) , you type M-x .
The minibuffer shows the prompt “ M-x ” ( a little unhelpful compared to the nice I - search prompt you get when you type C-s ) .
You now type “ tetris ” and press return .
Hey presto , you can now play tetris .
But how would you know that there was such a command without me telling you ?
There is no simple way for the beginner .
There are lists of commands available , but with 650 entries these hardly invite casual learning .
It ’s easy to get very discouraged when you start learning emacs since you can be forgiven for feeling a little irritated that even the simplest things are impossible to find ( and yet more advanced features leap out at you ) .
The closest emacs comes to a simple pedagogic vector is “ C-h a ” , the apropos command .
This lets you type a search word , and it will find all the commands that include that word .
The problem with this is you have to guess the terminology correctly .
When I was looking for word wrap this feature was useless because that ’s not what emacs calls it .
There is one other small assistance , when using M-x you have the help of “ auto - completion ” .
Pressing tab in the minibuffer will make emacs attempt to complete whatever you ’ve typed .
For example , if you type “ M - x tet ” and then press tab , it will finish the word “ tetris ” .
If however you type “ M - x te ” and then press tab , it displays all the commands available that start with “ te ” .
That ’s a small help , but it ’s really more useful when you know exactly what the command is since it saves some typing .
If you do n’t know how the command ’s name starts you ’re stuck .
Emacs badly needs a much more obvious way of discovering new features .
The problem is that the functions are not grouped into any sort of structure other than a big list of command names .
A hierarchical menu would be a massive improvement despite hierarchies being poorly understood by many people .
At the end of the day , emacs has been developed by programmers for programmers and so more complex interfaces using schemes like deep hierarchies would have been acceptable .
In practice however emacs just never bothered .
In my experience the way you discover its features is by asking a local guru .
How did they find out ?
Either by accident or by asking someone else .
The other option is of course to RTFM ( Read The F*ine Manual ) , but frankly that ’s just an admission of defeat announcing that the interface lacks teaching capability .
It does n’t get much better as you learn more of it , emacs needs a pedagogic vector very badly .
It ’s easy to forget
The obvious knock - on from being hard to learn is that it ’s hard to re-learn .
While nice logic in the key - bindings helps , ( can you remember what they were from the start of this essay ? ) it ’s not enough .
It is easy to forget .
Once upon a time I learnt how to switch on automatic text wrapping .
For ages I forgot how again , and the lack of a pedagogic vector meant that I knew I could do it , but I could n’t remember how .
The ultimate frustration .
Of course it ’s easy , “ M - x auto - fill - mode ” .
I ’d just forgotten that emacs called it filling , and that I needed the auto up front .
Emacs is not a good tool unless you keep in practice .
And even then , those features that you rarely use are all too easily forgotten .
Once I learnt how to record macros .
Now I ’ve forgotten , it ’s too much effort to re-learn .
I use it every day , but should I ever leave it for a few months my disloyalty would be severely punished .
Of course programmers never leave such a basic tool for such a huge length of time so the problem does n’t arise for them that often , and programmers like torturing themselves that way anyhow .
“ I can use emacs ” can be said with a swagger .
It fails to use more modern idioms
Emacs is stuck in the 80’s .
At the end of the day it ’s a terminal based tool .
Many of its best features have been provoked by this austerity but it fails to take advantage of the later developments in interface design .
There are no button bars , no tooltips , very few dialog boxes .
Some of these functions are better implemented in the minibuffer ( a true work of genius , a vast improvement on many dialog boxes ) , but button bars would not be a bad addition .
When you type a command using M-x after emacs often tells you what the key - binding for that command is ( if it has one ) when the command is completed .
That ’s great , could n’t we do that with buttons too ?
You would admittedly lose some screen real estate , but emacs has been so cautious with that up till now , and screens are much bigger than they were , we can afford to use some of it .
I would n’t put the absolutely basic stuff there , because people will learn those quickly , and the keyboard is faster , but those less frequent functions would be nice .
It would be great to have button bars for various groups of functionality .
I ’d like one for version control for example .
Being able to arrange these as I wanted would be a bonus .
Netscape ’s collapsing button bars might be one solution , except I do n’t like the way you ca n’t tell which bar is which when they ’re closed .
As emacs stands the M-x command is used as a general way of accessing all the power of emacs .
However , since this involves typing in the command you need , you need to know what that command is .
I have said before that M-x should be obsoleted , but this is probably overkill .
Rather there should be another way of accessing the whole of emacs ’ functionality .
This is a serious challenge given the number of commands emacs supports .
Menus break down well before being able to hold 650 functions so we are left looking for a new idiom .
This can in part be solved because not all functions are always relevant in all contexts .
For example , if you are writing code you do n’t need spell checking in all likelihood ( although some may disagree ) .
More helpful perhaps is the fact that many of emacs ' functions are obscure .
That is to say that they are rarely used .
It would be reasonable to divide the functions into everyday , frequent , occasional and never sets .
Clearly users would have their own views and this would need to be configurable , but there is almost certainly good agreement on many functions .
Everyday , frequent and some occasional functions should be on the menu- bar , but this probably only counts for a small proportion of the functionality .
The rest should be relegated to a hierarchical function browser .
Emacs does have hierarchical browsers of this kind but generally the hierarchies are very poorly designed which renders them virtually useless .
Configuration of emacs is another sore point .
Customization is based around a large number of variables arranged in a hierarchy which even as a programmer , with a solid understanding of such structures I find daunting .
The arrangement is poor and unclear and without mentioning that the way the values are edited is all based in a text editing frame .
I never use this feature , it ’s simply too painful .
It pays much more attention to making it easy to code than it does to being easy to use .
A few dialog boxes here would have made life much easier .
And then there ’s the .emacs file .
When emacs loads it examines a file called .emacs ( filenames starting with a dot in Unix are hidden ) .
This file can be used to set variables .
Mine for example switches on syntax highlighting ( which if you program you ’ll appreciate ) , and makes a couple of other tweaks .
This is hardly a pleasant way of changing the behaviour .
What ’s worse is that to change the text colour and the background colour it seems that I have to edit another configuration file that is not owned by emacs at all ( the . Xdefaults file as it happens ) .
There is probably a way of getting the .emacs file to do it but I ’ve never worked out how .
And that ’s the killer .
Whenever someone asks me “ can emacs do ... ” I always answer yes .
Can I do ... with emacs .
Often , no , but you can bet emacs can do it .
And that is a sign that a powerful piece of software is being let down by an insufficient user interface .
The Verdict
There are many features , and several idioms I ’ve not touched on in this essay , but I hope I ’ve made the main point I wanted to clearly enough .
Emacs is popular because once learnt , it allows the user to work with incredibly little interference or intrusion .
Very low friction if you will .
Emacs ’ use of the keyboard is excellent .
A skilled typist can make text flow and work incredibly fast .
Even though I do n’t touch type ( although I get close ) I can work very rapidly , faster with the keyboard than with the mouse .
That is the reward for learning and putting up with emacs ’ failings .
Emacs is one of those applications that I use almost entirely unconsciously and that is what makes it good .
But it ’s unpopular with others because it is simply very hard to learn .
You ca n’t use emacs occasionally and expect to be effective .
You either live emacs , or you leave it well alone .
To use a phrase from Donald Norman ’s book The Design of Everyday Things , emacs relies heavily on information in your head , rather than information in the world , by which I mean that you have to know how to use emacs , you ca n’t rely on its interface to help you out .
While this was very common in the world of command line software it has been improved on in the GUI world .
Emacs has failed to keep up .
If you want to learn to use emacs you ’d better make some space in your calendar .
So , how could we combine emacs with more Windows or Mac like editors to make a best of breed ?
Emacs would offer the minibuffer , and its interactive search , both of which are excellent features .
It would offer its incredible customizability and extensibility by third parties ( and ten thousandth parties for that matter ) .
It would offer many of its simple key - bindings for text manipulation .
In fact many editors I ’ve used on other platforms mimic some of emacs ’ key - bindings because once you ’ve learnt to use them you never want to go back !
More conventional editors would offer toolbars and dialog boxes for configuration .
They would offer drag and drop editing , inline spell checking ( one great word processor I used once would beep quietly when it saw you type a misspelt word , you could then decide to carry on and correct it later , or quickly cast an eye over it ) .
They would offer Recently Used Lists for the more obscure commands .
The fact that emacs can be used unconsciously is a major boon .
That fact that other editors can be learnt and used in minutes ( rather than months ) , is massively important .
Emacs lacks ways of browsing through its functions in a structured manner .
There is a command , accessed by the key sequence “ C-h i m emacs ” , but if you knew that , you probably did n’t need it .
Some other editors rely on the mouse for use , ( a bad idea when the main point of an editor requires your hands on the keyboard , moving from there to the mouse and back the whole time is very wasteful of time ) .
Some say what emacs really needs is a decent help system .
But look at the paperclip in Word .
The first thing I ever asked that was “ how do I get rid of you ? ” , which incidentally , it could n’t answer !
Word ’s help was overbearing and intrusive , which is why I really like emacs , it keeps out of your way .
I got this email from a friend when he read the first version of this essay .
> I ’ve still got about 90 % of emacs left to learn ( i.e. I need to learn > lisp ) but I find it an incredibly powerful tool even though I know > relatively little about it .
and here ’s a good point - all that extra > functionality is totally hidden from me until I decide I want to find > out how to use it .
It does n’t get in my way .
I like that .
Emacs does not interfere with you .
The paperclip in Word on the other hand nags .
I ’ve yet to meet someone who likes being nagged .
But I think emacs goes too far the other way .
I do n’t want help if I do n’t ask for it , but when I do ask for it I want it to be at hand and well arranged .
I think though that it comes back to the function browser point .
I want a decent function browser , with meaningful clear descriptions of the functions , preferably reasonably concise .
My analogy would be with the index of a reference book .
Without a good index the book is worthless regardless of the information inside simply cause you can’t find what you ’re looking for in a reasonable time .
Emacs desperately needs to simplify configuration .
With emacs almost anything can be achieved .
Ultimately you can write text processing macros in lisp if you really need a feature .
In fact that ’s precisely how many of the add - on modes have appeared .
So it ’s not that emacs ca n’t be configured , far from it .
It ’s just that making simple configuration changes like a key - binding or the colour scheme is non-trivial .
There is a customization menu structure , but it sheds more heat than light .
I ’ve played with it a few times , but I can never find the option I want to change .
I ’ve given up .
So overall , do I think that emacs can evolve to become the perfect editor ?
Probably not .
There ’s simply too much work to do to remold all that functionality into a new shape .
But I do think that many of the features of emacs will appear in the next greatest editor .
I like emacs , I use it every day .
I ’m highly productive with it and that ’s something I ca n’t get with any other editor , but it still irritates me when I step out of the bounds of what I ’ve learnt .
With the massive functionality emacs supports it ’s hard to see how an interface could be made to support it but perhaps there are some hints appearing ...
It ’s interesting to note that on Unix and Linux many applications use emacs key - bindings for entering text in dialog boxes and the like .
And that ’s an excellent thing .
So perhaps rather than emacs containing everything , everything should contain emacs .
Because of the unconscious nature of its interface it should be used everywhere text is entered , those simple key - bindings ( and many others I ’ve not mentioned ) should be used everywhere .
So perhaps emacs ’ legacy will reappear in editing components , but I ’ll say much more about that in a future essay on the effects of componentization in user interface design .
Finally I should point out , in case it ’s not obvious , that I do n’t know everything about emacs , the human brain is simply not that big , so it ’s entirely possible that I ’ve missed features that other people think I should have included .
Likewise it ’s entirely possible that I ’ve made some mistakes .
Please feel free to point these things out and I ’ll try to take note .
It should also be pointed out that a great many people have been involved in developing and improving emacs over the years , most famously of course Richard Stallman .
If you were one of emacs ’ contributors then you should feel a warm glow of pride , you have my thanks for such an excellent tool despite any criticism I may make .
But next time you make an editor be a little more generous to the casual user .
Emacs can be obtained from the GNU Emacs website or you ’ll find it included in almost every Linux distribution known to man !
Incidentally , if you wondered , emacs stands for Editing MACroS or Extensible MACro System depending who you ask , you can find that a few other morsels at the Free On - Line Dictionary of Computing ( FOLDOC ) .

If you rely on secret URLs as a security mechanism , you should make sure your logs are not public .
On Thursday I posted a blog entry related to the security around O2's MMS Messaging service .
My key point was that O2 were not authenticating the user and relied on URLs with hex strings to access MMS messages .
Several people pointed out that URLs were adequate security given the hex strings were 64 - bit keys so they could n't be guessed .
I did not disclose the full extent of the leak as it would have allowed access to non-indexed MMS messages and I wanted to give O2 a chance to fix this more serious problem first .
Note :
We have made O2 aware of this more serious problem and because O2 has now taken its multimedia servers off - line , the vulnerability described in this post no longer exists .
Update : On Tuesday I received a response from O2 :
Your details were forwarded to our project team who we believe have put a temporary fix in place at present .
I 'm unable to tell you when a permanent fix to this issue will be implemented .
I would like to thank you for your feedback .
Here 's how the attack works - Lets say a customer has a new iPhone 3G .
The iPhone 3G does n't support MMS messages , so if someone sends a MMS message to that customer they receive a notification to view it on O2's media server .
The link to the media server is a private URL with a hex string , so when it 's clicked on , an HTTP GET request is sent to the web server to retrieve the audio / image / video .
This would appear to be secure , as someone would be more likely to win the lottery than guess the key .
However , the private URL is n't so private when it 's publicly available on the O2 web server .
The web server providing the MMS messages uses mod_jk with JBoss / Tomcat and the default security settings are minimal .
There 's an information disclosure vulnerability if the Status Page is n't locked down .
The status page contains lots of system information such as the memory usage , data processed and discloses the URL's of the HTTP Requests to the server .
As O2 failed to lock down the status page it was public and anyone could see which URL's were currently being handled in a web browser .
Here 's a snapshot of the O2 Status Page I took where the HTTP GET requests were made available as well as the IP address of the client accessing the content .
Once the URL is known the audio / image / video being viewed and the persons phone number are disclosed .
Note : I 've hidden most of the data but you can see where the GET requests would have been available .
The mediamessaging .o2.co.uk server is now back online and the status page is no longer viewable .
In the past year there have been 2 security issues with O2's infrastructure linked to URL's , although in these cases the URL flaw was much easier to exploit .
Last February , the following Bluebook issue was reported :
Coding errors in Bluebook created a means for registered users to view other user 's messages ( and phone numbers ) simply by changing the message ID number in URLs used to access messages on the site .
In a statement , the mobile phone giant said that it has fixed the problem .
Last September , it was an issue with the Billing System :
Using the loophole in the site , it would have been possible to write a script to pull a list of mobile phone numbers assigned to particular firms , along with details of the calls made using those numbers over the last three months .
In most cases , the name and department of the person making calls was also readily available .[...]
Russell was able to access this information through a simple URL manipulation that allowed him to elevate his privileges to view information on the site .
Great powers tend to commit great blunders .
But will the US be stupid enough to destabilize Pakistan , one of the most resilient states British Empire left behind ?
If I have to bet whatever dollars I am left with , I will say : No .
Yet Pakistani print and electronic media are abuzz with the speculations about a large scale US - lead NATO attacks inside Pakistan 's tribal areas bordering Afghanistan .
Many will wonder what has brought us to this stage and what will these tactics achieve ?
We are lead to believe that the immediate context may be the killing of nine US soldiers in a daring Taleban attack on a military post in Eastern Afghanistan .
And Afghan President , Hamid Karzai , whose scripts and theatrics compete with most in the Bollywood , is also beating his chest blaming Pakistan and its Inter - Services Intelligence ( ISI ) for the recent deadly bomb attacks at the Indian embassy in Kabul .
Karzai government has also suspended various bilateral meetings with Pakistan due in Dubai , Islamabad and Kabul within the next few weeks .
Amidst this fury — shared in Kabul and New Delhi — no one is prepared to remember that even in the most third - rated of the Hollywood thrillers , the most obvious suspect is usually not the murderer ; while in Bollywood , mostly the usual suspect is a part of the set - up of the real villains .
But this is not a piece about overrated ISI , its equally dumb enemies and those who believe in its widely - exaggerated , almost magical powers , to operate without being caught — despite under continuous surveillance by the old friends and tutors in the CIA .
Well , let me admit : this is a rather dull and dreary piece to analyse the real context of the US manoeuvring in Afghanistan .
It is the election year in Washington , you know !
And as expected both sides are drawing blood on the question of " National Security " .
Barack Obama had always asserted that Iraq was the ' wrong war ' that diminished American security , damaged its standing in the world and ruined its economy and his punchline has always been that it affected America 's performance in the ' good war ' that is : Afghanistan .
Republicans wanted to fight this election on their credentials for national security and the good old John McCain , the Vietnam War veteran , was the perfect candidate in what is referred , by President Bush , as " elections in time of war " .
But it appears that Obama was increasingly successful in putting McCain and the Republicans on defensive on Iraq and Afghanistan .
It is true that even Obama moved to the right on the issue of Iraq , after he had to admit that the surge under Gen.
David Petraeus has shown results ; but now under attack from fellow democrats , who accused him of changing his earlier stance , he has remerged on the issue with a recent Op - Ed piece in New York Times , " My Plan for Iraq " .
And his plan for Iraq is intimately - linked to his plan for Afghanistan ; because he wants to divert troops and resources to the ' good war ' .
The horizontal pressure , for political adjustments , being generated by Republican election machinery should be obvious from McCain 's responses .
During the recent campaign stops in Albuquerque , New Mexico , the Vietnam War veteran agreed with Obama 's assertion that Bush administration had pursued a failed strategy in Iraq , though disagreed on how to proceed .
But even more interesting were his comments on Afghanistan , when he agreed that security has deteriorated and the status quo is not acceptable .
It is this paradigm shift — its anticipation by the administration and the Pentagon , over the last many months , and its steep buildup over the last few weeks — that is affecting the dynamics of the military manoeuvers in Afghanistan .
By now both sides fully agree that as the US forces will be withdrawn from Iraq , more of them will be sent to Afghanistan .
But what will constitute victory ?
This is far from clear .
First , what is needed is to differentiate between Al Qaeda and Taleban .
Second , it is important to appreciate that since the US occupation and military operations post - 9/11 , newer realities have emerged .
The state of incessant conflict , the presence of the foreign troops in the area , repeated military operations by Pakistani forces , mounting Pashtun casualties and the inter-play of various internal and external stake - holders and regional interests have lead to new faultlines between those who represent western - style modernity and those who oppose it .
Large pockets of populations who had nothing inherently against the US or the West or Islamabad have been compelled to take positions on all sorts of religious , cultural and social issues they would have ignored altogether in the absence of conflict in the region .
US forces have in the last few years attacked several times ; someone argues almost 46 times .
Hundreds have perished in such attacks .
But it has only exaggerated the polarisation in this area .
Fresh and larger attacks will further destabilize elected governments , ensure a longer running conflict , and send waves of Pashtun immigrants to other parts of Pakistan , most notably Karachi — which , many will not know , is world 's largest Pashtun city .
These days everyone , from journalists in Rocky Mountains to taxi drivers in New Mexico , has developed a license to point out the failures of the Pakistani state .
But little do they realize that Pakistan has successfully absorbed the shockwaves of four decades of internecine conflict in the region ; which only testifies to the resilience of the state structures British had left behind .
Hot pursuits will help in creating the right impressions of something being done in Afghanistan ; in an election year , it will look mighty good on the screens of Fox and CBS ; the only problem is it wo n't offer any sustainable solution on the ground — if anything , it will increase the burdens on the strained state structures of Pakistan that are still standing after four decades of war in the neighbourhood .

You probably know intuitively that applications have limited powers in Intel x86 computers and that only operating system code can perform certain tasks , but do you know how this really works ?
This post takes a look at x86 privilege levels , the mechanism whereby the OS and CPU conspire to restrict what user - mode programs can do .
There are four privilege levels , numbered 0 ( most privileged ) to 3 ( least privileged ) , and three main resources being protected : memory , I/O ports , and the ability to execute certain machine instructions .
At any given time , an x86 CPU is running in a specific privilege level , which determines what code can and cannot do .
These privilege levels are often described as protection rings , with the innermost ring corresponding to highest privilege .
Most modern x86 kernels use only two privilege levels , 0 and 3 :
x86 Protection Rings
About 15 machine instructions , out of dozens , are restricted by the CPU to ring zero .
Many others have limitations on their operands .
These instructions can subvert the protection mechanism or otherwise foment chaos if allowed in user mode , so they are reserved to the kernel .
An attempt to run them outside of ring zero causes a general - protection exception , like when a program uses invalid memory addresses .
Likewise , access to memory and I/O ports is restricted based on privilege level .
But before we look at protection mechanisms , let 's see exactly how the CPU keeps track of the current privilege level , which involves the segment selectors from the previous post .
Here they are :
Segment Selectors - Data and Code
The full contents of data segment selectors are loaded directly by code into various segment registers such as ss ( stack segment register ) and ds ( data segment register ) .
This includes the contents of the Requested Privilege Level ( RPL ) field , whose meaning we tackle in a bit .
The code segment register ( cs ) is , however , magical .
First , its contents cannot be set directly by load instructions such as mov , but rather only by instructions that alter the flow of program execution , like call .
Second , and importantly for us , instead of an RPL field that can be set by code , cs has a Current Privilege Level ( CPL ) field maintained by the CPU itself .
This 2 - bit CPL field in the code segment register is always equal to the CPU 's current privilege level .
The Intel docs wobble a little on this fact , and sometimes online documents confuse the issue , but that 's the hard and fast rule .
At any time , no matter what 's going on in the CPU , a look at the CPL in cs will tell you the privilege level code is running with .
Keep in mind that the CPU privilege level has nothing to do with operating system users .
Whether you 're root , Administrator , guest , or a regular user , it does not matter .
All user code runs in ring 3 and all kernel code runs in ring 0 , regardless of the OS user on whose behalf the code operates .
Sometimes certain kernel tasks can be pushed to user mode , for example user - mode device drivers in Windows Vista , but these are just special processes doing a job for the kernel and can usually be killed without major consequences .
Due to restricted access to memory and I / O ports , user mode can do almost nothing to the outside world without calling on the kernel .
It ca n't open files , send network packets , print to the screen , or allocate memory .
User processes run in a severely limited sandbox set up by the gods of ring zero .
That 's why it 's impossible , by design , for a process to leak memory beyond its existence or leave open files after it exits .
All of the data structures that control such things - memory , open files , etc - cannot be touched directly by user code ; once a process finishes , the sandbox is torn down by the kernel .
That 's why our servers can have 600 days of uptime - as long as the hardware and the kernel do n't crap out , stuff can run for ever .
This is also why Windows 95 / 98 crashed so much : it 's not because " M$ sucks " but because important data structures were left accessible to user mode for compatibility reasons .
It was probably a good trade - off at the time , albeit at high cost .
The CPU protects memory at two crucial points : when a segment selector is loaded and when a page of memory is accessed with a linear address .
Protection thus mirrors memory address translation where both segmentation and paging are involved .
When a data segment selector is being loaded , the check below takes place :
x86 Segment Protection
Since a higher number means less privilege , MAX ( ) above picks the least privileged of CPL and RPL , and compares it to the descriptor privilege level ( DPL ) .
If the DPL is higher or equal , then access is allowed .
The idea behind RPL is to allow kernel code to load a segment using lowered privilege .
For example , you could use an RPL of 3 to ensure that a given operation uses segments accessible to user - mode .
The exception is for the stack segment register ss , for which the three of CPL , RPL , and DPL must match exactly .
In truth , segment protection scarcely matters because modern kernels use a flat address space where the user - mode segments can reach the entire linear address space .
Useful memory protection is done in the paging unit when a linear address is converted into a physical address .
Each memory page is a block of bytes described by a page table entry containing two fields related to protection : a supervisor flag and a read / write flag .
The supervisor flag is the primary x86 memory protection mechanism used by kernels .
When it is on , the page cannot be accessed from ring 3 .
While the read / write flag is n't as important for enforcing privilege , it 's still useful .
When a process is loaded , pages storing binary images ( code ) are marked as read only , thereby catching some pointer errors if a program attempts to write to these pages .
This flag is also used to implement copy on write when a process is forked in Unix .
Upon forking , the parent 's pages are marked read only and shared with the forked child .
If either process attempts to write to the page , the processor triggers a fault and the kernel knows to duplicate the page and mark it read / write for the writing process .
Finally , we need a way for the CPU to switch between privilege levels .
If ring 3 code could transfer control to arbitrary spots in the kernel , it would be easy to subvert the operating system by jumping into the wrong ( right ? ) places .
A controlled transfer is necessary .
This is accomplished via gate descriptors and via the sysenter instruction .
A gate descriptor is a segment descriptor of type system , and comes in four sub - types : call - gate descriptor , interrupt - gate descriptor , trap - gate descriptor , and task - gate descriptor .
Call gates provide a kernel entry point that can be used with ordinary call and jmp instructions , but they are n't used much so I 'll ignore them .
Task gates are n't so hot either ( in Linux , they are only used in double faults , which are caused by either kernel or hardware problems ) .
That leaves two juicier ones : interrupt and trap gates , which are used to handle hardware interrupts ( e.g. , keyboard , timer , disks ) and exceptions ( e.g. , page faults , divide by zero ) .
I 'll refer to both as an " interrupt " .
These gate descriptors are stored in the Interrupt Descriptor Table ( IDT ) .
Each interrupt is assigned a number between 0 and 255 called a vector , which the processor uses as an index into the IDT when figuring out which gate descriptor to use when handling the interrupt .
Interrupt and trap gates are nearly identical .
Their format is shown below along with the privilege checks enforced when an interrupt happens .
I filled in some values for the Linux kernel to make things concrete .
Interrupt Descriptor with Privilege Check
Both the DPL and the segment selector in the gate regulate access , while segment selector plus offset together nail down an entry point for the interrupt handler code .
Kernels normally use the segment selector for the kernel code segment in these gate descriptors .
An interrupt can never transfer control from a more - privileged to a less - privileged ring .
Privilege must either stay the same ( when the kernel itself is interrupted ) or be elevated ( when user - mode code is interrupted ) .
In either case , the resulting CPL will be equal to to the DPL of the destination code segment ; if the CPL changes , a stack switch also occurs .
If an interrupt is triggered by code via an instruction like int n , one more check takes place : the gate DPL must be at the same or lower privilege as the CPL .
This prevents user code from triggering random interrupts .
If these checks fail - you guessed it - a general - protection exception happens .
All Linux interrupt handlers end up running in ring zero .
During initialization , the Linux kernel first sets up an IDT in setup_idt ( ) that ignores all interrupts .
It then uses functions in include / asm - x86 / desc.h to flesh out common IDT entries in arch / x86/ kernel/traps_32.c .
In Linux , a gate descriptor with " system " in its name is accessible from user mode and its set function uses a DPL of 3 .
A " system gate " is an Intel trap gate accessible to user mode .
Otherwise , the terminology matches up .
Hardware interrupt gates are not set here however , but instead in the appropriate drivers .
Three gates are accessible to user mode : vectors 3 and 4 are used for debugging and checking for numeric overflows , respectively .
Then a system gate is set up for the SYSCALL_VECTOR , which is 0x80 for the x86 architecture .
This was the mechanism for a process to transfer control to the kernel , to make a system call , and back in the day I applied for an " int 0x80 " vanity license plate :) .
Starting with the Pentium Pro , the sysenter instruction was introduced as a faster way to make system calls .
It relies on special - purpose CPU registers that store the code segment , entry point , and other tidbits for the kernel system call handler .
When sysenter is executed the CPU does no privilege checking , going immediately into CPL 0 and loading new values into the registers for code and stack ( cs , eip , ss , and esp ) .
Only ring zero can load the sysenter setup registers , which is done in enable_sep_cpu( ) .
Finally , when it 's time to return to ring 3 , the kernel issues an iret or sysexit instruction to return from interrupts and system calls , respectively , thus leaving ring 0 and resuming execution of user code with a CPL of 3 .
Vim tells me I 'm approaching 1,900 words , so I / O port protection is for another day .
This concludes our tour of x86 rings and protection .
Thanks for reading !

The aim of Russia 's policy , expressed in 1992 , is to " be leader of stability and security on the entire territory of the former USSR " .
What has changed is not the aim but the " correlation of forces " .
As Boris Yeltsin declared to Russia 's intelligence services in 1994 , " global ideological confrontation has been replaced by a struggle for spheres of interest in geopolitics " .
Back then , Russia had little to struggle with .
That is no longer the case .
If Western interests are not to be irreparably damaged , we will need to understand that they are being tested on three levels : local , regional and global .
Georgia is not just a square on a chessboard , but an important country in its own right .
For two reasons , the West can not be indifferent to what happens there .
First , Georgia 's political culture is democratic , its people pro-Western , and its sense of national identity almost indestructible .
Georgia can be defeated by Russia , but it can no longer submit to it , and therefore war between Georgia and Russia would be a frightening prospect even if no wider interests existed .
Second , the only energy pipeline in the former USSR independent of Russian control passes through Georgia .
There will be no meaningful energy security , let alone diversification of energy supplies , if these pipelines become vulnerable to sabotage , like those in Iraq , or to takeover by businesses fronting for Russian interests .
But Georgia is equally important to Russia .
Russia has only controlled the nationalities of the north Caucasus when it has dominated the south Caucasus .
Despite the so - called " normalisation " in Chechnya , the north Caucasus remains , to Russia 's leaders , the Achilles heel of the Russian Federation and , after the slaughter of schoolchildren in Beslan in 2004 , a subject of nightmares for Russia 's people .
Russia 's determination to hold sway in South Ossetia and Abkhazia must be seen in this light .
But it also serves another purpose : as a means to deny Georgia admission to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation .
These territories mean far less to Russia than they do to Georgia .
So long as this is the case , Georgia risks finding itself hostage to Russian intentions , and so for that matter do NATO and the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe .
And so Russia would like everyone to think .
" Everyone " includes Ukraine , whose Government , like Georgia 's , aspires to NATO membership .
Unlike Georgia , Ukraine has no territorial conflicts , but it has a potential territorial dispute , Crimea .
What is more , Russia 's Black Sea Fleet is authorised to remain there until 2017 .
Russia 's regional objectives are straightforward .
It aims to show its neighbours that Russia is " glavniy " : that its contentment is the key to " stability and security " , and that if Russia expresses its discontent , NATO cannot help .
It aims to show NATO that its newest aspirant members are divided , divisible and , in the case of Georgia , reckless .
The broader implication is that the era of Western dominance is over .
Far from rejecting globalisation , the Russian view , in the words of the Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov , is that the West is " losing its monopoly over the globalisation process " .
The West will not have adequate responses to these events until it draws adequate conclusions .
The first is that the era of democratic " coloured revolutions " is over .
A few years ago , the Kremlin rightly feared Georgia 's Rose Revolution and Ukraine 's Orange Revolution might destabilise the political elite in Russia .
Today , the issue is whether these countries will be able to achieve their minimal objectives .
Given today 's harsh " correlation of forces " , the issue for Tbilisi is not whether it is right to use force against separatists but whether it is wise .
The issue for Kiev is not whether its Prime Minister threatens its President but whether their divisions threaten the independence of the country .
The issue for NATO and the European Union is whether their " currency of influence " buys stability and security in this region and , if not , whether it is time to change it .
The second conclusion is that NATO must revisit the assumptions upon which its enlargement policy has been based .
Contrary to the view that NATO remains a Cold War institution , the fact is it has evolved too much .
It assumed Russia would adjust and gradually address " common " security problems rather than pose a distinct set of security problems .
Partner countries now find themselves confronting realpolitik and some unnerving measures in new member states - and virtually no one is prepared for it .
Until recently , NATO was proud that it had no policy for resolving the region 's conflicts beyond cliche : " autonomy " , " respect for territorial integrity " , " negotiation " , " non-use of force " .
Until there is a policy , there can not be a favourable outcome .
The third conclusion is Russia is contemptuous of the West .
Russians have shown a utilitarian asperity in connecting means and ends .
In exchange , we present an unfocused commitment to values and process .
Our democracy agenda has earned the resentment not only of Russia 's elite but of the ordinary people who are delighted to see Georgia being taught a lesson .
Russians have no worries about the emergence of a unified EU energy policy , and they are losing their worries about a unified commitment to NATO enlargement .
The war in South Ossetia should be a reminder that contempt has consequences .

DETROIT , Michigan ( CNN ) -- Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick was jailed Thursday after a judge found he had violated terms of his bond by taking an unauthorized trip to Canada last month .
Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick 's booking photo from the Wayne County Sheriff 's Department .
Kilpatrick , who is facing felony charges of perjury , obstruction of justice and misconduct of office , had been free on $ 75,000 bond .
Wayne County Sheriff Warren
Evans said the mayor will be treated like any other high - profile inmate at the jail .
Measures will be taken to ensure his security as well as that of other inmates at the facility , the sheriff added .
Kilpatrick will be held in a restricted area where no one except deputies will be allowed to have close contact with him , the sheriff said .
The mayor has been snarled in a public scandal since January , when the Detroit Free Press reported he exchanged romantic text messages with his former chief of staff , Christine Beatty , indicating the two were involved in an affair .
He and Beatty , testifying last fall in a whistle - blower trial , had denied they had been having an affair .
Kilpatrick attorney Jim Parkman said an immediate appeal of the mayor 's jailing is planned .
A hearing on the appeal is scheduled for Friday , the Detroit Free Press reported .
Parkman noted Kilpatrick 's trip " was n't a personal trip over there to go to Caesar 's Palace and play , " but for Detroit business .
" He believes it was the right thing to do , and on the spur of the moment , he just went , " Parkman said .
Kilpatrick visited Windsor , Ontario , on July 23 to discuss with Windsor 's mayor a plan to sell Detroit 's half of the tunnel connecting the two cities , according to the Free Press .
See how close the two cities are »
Under the terms of his bond , Kilpatrick was required to give the court 48 hours ' notice for business travel , District Court Judge Ronald Giles noted Thursday .
Kilpatrick apologized for the trip , telling Giles his first priority was taking care of the city .
Do n't Miss WDIV : Mayor asks for forgiveness
" I guess the problem I 'm having is , I do n't think there 's too much of anything you do alone , " Giles told Kilpatrick .
" And even on that day , it 's not that you got a telephone call , jumped in your SUV and drove across the bridge or the tunnel .
You go to the phone .
You made several telephone calls .
" You had to call security .
You had to contact the deputy mayor and executive assistant .
You had to make arrangements , " Giles said .
" You do n't do anything without making arrangements , and one of those arrangements has to be in relationship to this court . "
Watch the judge order Kilpatrick to jail »
The judge said that last week , in addressing another violation by Kilpatrick , he had made it clear : " Do n't come back . "
" What matters to me is how the court is perceived , " Giles said .
" And if it was not Kwame Kilpatrick sitting in that seat , if it was ' John Six - Pack ' sitting in that seat , what would I do ?
And there the answer is simple , so I 'm going to go back to my original ' keep it simple ' ... anybody else sitting in that chair , that 's exactly what would happen . "
Parkman said he was not surprised by the judge 's ruling .
" It did not come as a shock , " he said .
" The judge , I would say , is his own man . "
Watch what else Parkman had to say »
Wayne County Attorney Kym Worthy issued a statement saying she thinks Giles took appropriate action " considering [ Kilpatrick 's ] most recent behavior .
Judge Giles treated this defendant as any other defendant would have been treated . "
Earlier Thursday , Kilpatrick and Beatty waived their preliminary examination and agreed the case could be forwarded to Wayne County Circuit Court 's Criminal Division .
Beatty , who resigned her post after the text messages were made public , is also facing charges .
If convicted , both face a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison .
Kilpatrick has rejected calls from critics that he resign .
The city said in a statement that the government will continue to function as normal , with a deputy mayor in charge .
" It 's very unfortunate , " said Kenneth Cockrel Jr. , president of the Detroit City Council and one of Kilpatrick 's critics .
" It 's another sad chapter in an ongoing saga , which I hope can be brought to a close soon .
It 's not good for the city of Detroit ; it 's not good for the southeastern Michigan region ; it 's not good for the entire state . "
Allegations that Kilpatrick had an affair with Beatty arose during the police whistle - blower trial last summer in Wayne County Circuit Court .
The case involved two police officers -- Deputy Chief Gary Brown and Officer Harold Nelthrope , a mayoral bodyguard -- who were suing Kilpatrick and the city of Detroit .
The officers claimed they were fired to halt a misconduct probe of Kilpatrick .
The probe could have exposed allegations that two of Kilpatrick 's bodyguards drank on the job , falsified time sheets and facilitated the mayor 's infidelity , court documents said .
The lawsuit and another unrelated case was settled for about $ 8 million , the officer 's attorneys said .
Critics have said Kilpatrick settled the case in part to keep the affair with Beatty secret .
All About Kwame Kilpatrick • Detroit
I ’m a big fan of typography in general .
If you check out my homepage or my contact elliottcable page , and you ’re using Safari / WebKit or Opera / Kestrel , you ’ll notice the typefaces ( fonts , as colloquialized ) are very non-standard .
( As of this writing , I ’m using Museo and Diavlo1 heavily on both . )
The internet has not be a friendly place for typohiles like myself , up to this point , at least .
One might even say it was a frightful , mentally scarring environment for those akin to yours truly .
We ’ve been restricted to reading page after page after page on day after day after day for year after year after year abominations of markup and design enslaved by the horrible overlords we know as Lucida , Verdana , Arial , Helvetica , Geneva , Georgia , Courier , and … dare I invoke ye , thou my terrible overlord ?
Times New Roman .
Wherefore art thou , my glorious Archer ?
And thee as well , my beautiful Garamond ?
The technical restrictions of that horrible monster we know as the Web Browser hath forced us all too long to use those most banal , those most common , and those most abused , out of all of the typefaces of the world .
All hyperbole aside , I ’m extremely happy to see the advent of a standard @font - face declaration in CSS .
Internet Explorer first implemented a crutched , basic version of this way back in version 4 , but nothing ever really came of it - their decision to create the proprietary2 .
EOT format to appease overly restrictive type foundries ’ worries about intellectual property ( aka .
the cold , hard dominatrix that we know only as Ms. Profit ) truly and completely killed that initial attempt at bringing astute typography and it ’s advocates to the web .
This new run at @font - face by an established , trusted , and open group ( the W3C itself , responsible for helping to make much of what we use as designers on the web standard and cross- system compatible ) has a much better chance , in my humble opinion - and I am quite looking forward to the consequences if it succeeds .
Now , onwards to the topic of my post as declared in the header ( yes , I know , a slow start - but it ’s an interesting topic with an interesting history ! ) .
WebKit , the open source rendering engine behind the wonderfulness that is Safari , and how it handles the ‘ new ’ @font - face declaration .
No , it ’s not really ‘ new ’ , but yes , it feels like it is .
To put it simply , and to be very blunt , it ’s broken .
The CSS spec section for @font - face is very specific - typefaces are to be selected based on a wide array of criteria placed in the @font - face declaration block itself .
Various textual CSS attributes may be defined within the @font - face declaration , and then they will be checked when the typeface is referred to later in the CSS .
For instance , if I have two @font - face declarations for the Diavlo family - one for regular text , and one for a heavier weighted version of the typeface - then I later utilize Diavlo in a font - family : attribute , it should refer to the basic Diavlo font defined in the first @font - face .
However , if I were to do the same , but also specify a heavy font - weight : , then it should use the heavier version of Diavlo .
To place this example in code :
@font - face { font - family : ' Diavlo ' ; src : url (./Diavlo/Diavlo_Book.otf ) format ( " opentype " ) ; } @font - face { font - family : ' Diavlo ' ; font - weight : 900 ; src : url ( ./Diavlo/Diavlo_Black.otf ) format ( " opentype " ) ; } h1 , h2 , h3 , h4 , h5 , h6 { font - family : ' Diavlo ' ; font - weight : 900 ; } div#content { font - family : ' Diavlo ' ; }
As you can see , my headings should use the typeface defined in Diavlo_Black.otf , while my body content should use Diavlo_Book .otf .
However , in WebKit , this does n’t work - it completely ignores any attribute except font - family : and src : in a @font - face declaration !
Completely ignores them !
Not only that - not only that - it disregards all but the last @font - face for a given font - family : attribute string !
The implication here is that , to make @font - face work as it is currently implemented in WebKit ( and thus , Safari 3.1 ) , I have to declare completely imaginary , non-existent type families to satisfy WebKit alone .
Here ’s the method I have used in the places I current implement @font - face :
@font - face { font - family : ' Diavlo Book ' ; src : url (./Diavlo/Diavlo_Book.otf ) format ( " opentype " ) ; } @font - face { font - family : ' Diavlo Black ' ; src : url (./Diavlo/Diavlo_Black.otf ) format ( " opentype " ) ; } h1 , h2 , h3 , h4 , h5 , h6 { font - family : ' Diavlo Black ' ; } div#content { font - family : ' Diavlo Book ' ; }
Is n’t it horrible ?
Seriously , my eyes , they bleed .
There ’s lots of problems with this far beyond the lack of semanticity when it comes to the typeface names … let me see how many ways this breaks the purpose of @font - face :
You remove a large element our control over the display of the page .
As soon as we begin to use @font - face in our page , we can no longer make any use of any other textual control attribute - font - weight : , font - style : , and font - variant : are no longer available to us , because they no longer correctly map to technical typeface variant / features .
Also , many default elements are destroyed , unusable , without ‘ fixing ’ - for instance , < b > would have no effect in a page styled for WebKit as above ;
We would have to specify something like b {font - family : ' Diavlo Black ' ;} - how broken is that ?
Unless we caught all such default elements and re-styled them to use the bastardized names instead of the correct attributes , lots of basic HTML formatting would be broken .
I myself may never use in - document formatting ( separation of design and content ! ) , but what about comments forms ?
Forum posts ?
Direct HTML - literal quotes ?
If we want to use Javascript to modify the display of the content , we ca n’t simply adjust the mentioned textual control attributes - we have to know and change the entire font - family : array of strings .
You make us very wet .
And by wet , I mean ‘ not DRY ’.
What if we decide to change one of the bastardized font names ?
Or use a different font entirely ?
We have to go through all of our CSS , all of our Javascript , and make sure we update every occurrence of the typeface ’s bastardized name .
You remove our user ’s user choice , and waste bandwidth .
Since the names refer to families that do n’t , in fact , exist , the browser ca n’t override the declaration with a user ’s installed version of the typeface .
This means that , regardless of whether the user already has the typeface installed on their own computer , the browser wo n’t use that - it does n’t know to use ‘ Diavlo ’ , which the user has installed , because it was told to use ‘ Diavlo Black ’ , which no user in the entire world has installed on their computer .
This whole thing is rather worrying - I ’ve heard Opera has @font - face support , though I have n’t had time to test this myself , so I do n’t know if it actually does - or , for that matter , if it does it ‘ correctly ’ , or has the same problems as WebKit .
But either way , WebKit is one of the first two implementations to ever attempt to support @font - face ( Microsoft ’s unrelated @font - face declaration notwithstanding ) - I really do n’t want to see it ’s early mistakes carried on to FireFox in a few years , and then Internet Explorer a few decades after that .
That will leave us stuck with this broken system forever , as it has been demonstrated time and time again that if nobody else supports an old standard correctly , a newcomer to the standard will not do it correctly either .
I for one would really , really , hate that .

ROME , June 12 ( Reuters ) - A German sports reporter who was late for his plane to cover the European Championships staged a bomb scare at Italy ’s Verona airport in order to delay its take - off , police said on Thursday .
The 27 - year - old reporter , who has not been identified , called police saying a bomb had been planted on the Air Dolomiti flight to Vienna on Wednesday , police in northern Verona told Reuters by telephone on Thursday .
The airport was closed for about two hours and two incoming flights were forced to land at another airport .
The reporter arrived at check - in just five minutes before the scheduled take off , shortly after the phone call announcing the bomb scare .
When told he was too late to check in he said he had heard the plane was still not ready for take off , even though the airport officials had still not made any announcement of any delay .
“ He changed his version several times , first claiming he had arrived at the airport on time and then admitting he only arrived five minutes before take - off , ” a police officer said .
The man ’s mobile phone was linked to the call .
He was arrested and charged with causing an alarm and interrupting a public service .
A little extra info on this scene .
This scene contains a cameo appearance from hip - hop 's Ghostface Killah .
Ghostface is one of the original members of the Wu - Tang clan and has gone by the alias of " Tony Stark " since the early 90s .
As his persona dictates , he is a baller and a player .
Apparently Ghostface knows the real Tony Stark in this Marvel reality .
So well that Tony trusts Ghostface enough to accept a certain pair of women from someone with " equal " tastes .

In July 29 congressional action on the most recent iteration of an extension to the federal production tax credit – Senate Bill 3335 – a motion to proceed to consideration of the measure was withdrawn in the Senate .
On July 23 , governors of all 50 states and the U.S. Virgin Islands and Northern Mariana Islands sent a letter to Sens. Harry Reid and Mitch McConnell , Rep. John Boehner , and Speaker Nancy Pelosi calling for a five - year extension of the tax credit for renewable energy .
In the letter , the governors indicate that efforts to extend tax credits that will expire in December have ‘ fallen short ’ and an extension is necessary ‘ as soon as possible . ’
The governors also say they support extension of tax credits as a supplement to the extensive renewable energy policies they have advanced at the state level .

Russia responded to the apparent Georgian preparations by dispatching 400 paratroopers and a battery of howitzers to a staging area not far from the cease - fire line , provoking a strong protest from NATO .
“ At the end of the day , we were very close to war ” on May 9 , says Temuri Yacobashvili , the Georgian minister of reintegration and a Saakashvili confidant .
In fact , diplomats in Georgia and elsewhere give somewhat more credence to the Russian claims than to Georgia ’s .
State Department officials urged Mr. Saakashvili to calm down .
Perhaps each side was trying to provoke the other into striking first , and thus losing the battle of public opinion .
Of course , that ’s how wars often start .
Until last week , it was Abkhazia , not South Ossetia , that seemed the likeliest candidate for a war of inadvertence , and so I visited there in late June .
It was hard to fathom what people were fighting over .
In the capital , Sukhumi , population 40,000 , relics of the fighting were everywhere , and the giant Soviet - era Parliament building was a scorched hulk .
The streets were all but deserted .
THE SPIRAL DOWN
Talking to the Georgians about Abkhazia , and the Abkhaz about Georgia , was like shuttling between the Israelis and the Palestinians .
The Georgians said that they were “ always there , ” that Abkhazia was a Georgian kingdom , and that only by expelling the ethnic Georgians at the end of the war did the Abkhaz make themselves a majority in the province .
The Abkhaz said that they are the descendants of a “ 1,000 - year - old kingdom , ” that they were the victims of a massive campaign of Russian deportation in the 1860s , and then that Stalin forced them into the Georgian yoke .
The Abkhaz talk about the Georgians pretty much the same way that the Georgians talk about the Russians .
On that point , the Abkhaz share much with the South Ossetians .
For them , as for the Ossetians , Georgia is the neighborhood bully .
It ’s a pretty safe bet that Georgia and Abkhazia will not resolve their conflict on their own .
Both breakaway regions are quite willing to live with the Russian - enforced status quo , but even relatively moderate Georgian officials consider that status quo utterly unacceptable .
When I asked Temuri Yacobashvili , a cultivated man who is one of the country ’s leading art patrons , why Georgia could n’t focus on the threat from Russia and let the Abkhaz have their de facto state , he said , “ These are not two different things , because it ’s not amputating hand , it ’s amputating head , or heart .
No Georgian president could survive if he gave up on Abkhazia . ”
And , he added , “ if the international community by its inaction will not leave any other option for Georgia , then we have to make decision . ”
If the West , that is , wo n’t induce Russia to stop using the border region as a pawn , Georgia will be left with no choice save war .
And how will the West do that ?
Mr. Saakashvili suggests sanctions , like travel bans , on individual Russian leaders .
When I posed the same question to Giga Bokeria , another confidante who is deputy minister for foreign affairs , he said , “ If Russia ceases to be an empire . ”
These are not serious answers .

The situation in both Abkhazia and South Ossetia took yet another turn down the spiral of confrontation in July , when mysterious acts of violence plagued both regions .
There were bombings in Abkhazia .
There were shootings in South Ossetia .
Who was behind the string of attacks ?
Criminal gangs ?
Provocateurs ?
Georgian secret agents ?
No one knew , but that did n’t stop the accusations from flying .
Abkhazia closed the cease - fire line , then cut all ties with Georgia .
On July 8 , with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice about to visit Georgia , Russia sent fighter jets over South Ossetia .
Georgian Interior Ministry forces squared off against civilians in South Ossetia .
The pot was boiling .
And then , last week , the lid blew in South Ossetia , for reasons that remain unclear .
Diplomats are now laboring mightily to prevent the war from spreading , though hostilities may serve too many different interests to be easily contained .
John McCain has changed his position on illegal warrantless wiretapping : he used to think that the President had to uphold the nation 's laws .
Now he says that the Constitution is subordinate to the all - powerful executive order .
My favorite line on this comes from the chickenhawks who say that the Fourth Amendment was written before the All Powerful Threat of Terrorism .
Sure thing .
Ben Franklin and his pals could n't possibly have foreseen a world in which the very idea of America was under some kind of military threat .
Those candyasses did n't understand what war was about .
They were armchair theorists , civilians who'd never anticipated foreign soldiers on American soil — surely if they 'd known that America might some day face an actual existential risk , they would have put a little asterisk next to each clause of the Bill of Rights leading to a footnote that said , " Unless the king president really , really needs to do it . "
[ N] either the Administration nor the telecoms need apologize for actions that most people , except for the ACLU and the trial lawyers , understand were Constitutional and appropriate in the wake of the attacks on September 11 , 2001 . [ … ]
We do not know what lies ahead in our nation 's fight against radical Islamic extremists , but John McCain will do everything he can to protect Americans from such threats , including asking the telecoms for appropriate assistance to collect intelligence against foreign threats to the United States as authorized by Article II of the Constitution .

Before I start into the meat of this post , I feel the need to emphasize , as strongly as I can , four things :
I do not receive any funding from the telecommunications industry in general , or wireless phone companies in particular .
None at all .
In other words , I ’m not in the pocket of “ big mobile ” any more than I am in the pocket of big pharma .
I do n’t own any stock in telecommunications companies , other than as parts of mutual funds in which my retirement funds are invested that purchase shares in many , many different companies , some of which may or may not be telecommunications companies .
( I should probably go and look at the list . )
None of my friends or family work for cell phone companies .
I do n’t have a dog in this hunt .
I really do n’t .
I say this because these are the most common accusations I hear whenever I venture into this particular topic area , and I thought I ’d just clear that up right away in order ( hopefully ) to preempt any similar comments after this post .
Indeed , one of the favorite retorts to anyone who criticizes fearmongering about cell phones is to try to insinuate that that person is only doing so because he or she is in the pocket of industry , and I ’ve been at the receiving end of such claims .
Unfortunately , I ’m sure someone will probably show his or her lack of reading comprehension and post one of those very criticisms of me .
It ’s almost inevitable .
Even though posting such disclaimers never works against the “ pharma shill ” gambit when I write about vaccines or dubious cancer cures , nonetheless hope springs eternal .
Now that that obligatory unpleasantness is out of the way , let me move on to say that I ’m very puzzled about something that happened last week .
I know that being puzzled is n’t particularly unusual for me .
Indeed , I ’m frequently puzzled about a great many things .
I ca n’t figure out how , for example , anyone with the slightest bit of reason or critical thinking ability can believe that homeopathy is anything other than water treated with , in essence , magical spells accompanied by shaking or do anything other than laugh when informed what homeopathy really is and how it supposedly “ works . ”
I ca n’t figure out how anyone can look at the mass of interlocking evidence from multiple different scientific specialties supporting evolution and reject still reject one of the most powerful scientific theories ever to spring from the human mind , deciding instead that creationism or its bastard offspring , “ intelligent design ” creationism is anything more than pure religion or rank religion - inspired pseudoscience .
I ca n’t figure out why American Idol or Survivor is so amazingly popular .
And I ca n’t figure out why on earth the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Center released this warning about cell phones last week :
PITTSBURGH July 24 , 2008 , 07:13 am ET ·
The head of a prominent cancer research institute issued an unprecedented warning to his faculty and staff Wednesday : Limit cell phone use because of the possible risk of cancer .
The warning from Dr. Ronald B. Herberman , director of the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute , is contrary to numerous studies that do n’t find a link between cancer and cell phone use , and a public lack of worry by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration .
Herberman is basing his alarm on early unpublished data .
He says it takes too long to get answers from science and he believes people should take action now — especially when it comes to children .
“ Really at the heart of my concern is that we should n’t wait for a definitive study to come out , but err on the side of being safe rather than sorry later , ” Herberman said .
Dr. Herberman is a highly respected cancer center director whom I ’ve in general thought well of , and the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute is a highly respected cancer center .
I know a few people there , and in the past I ’ve worked closely with two surgeons who trained there .
One in particular remains my collaborator , even though I ’ve moved on from the institution where we were once partners .
That ’s why I can’t help but wonder just what on earth Dr. Herberman was smoking when he decided to issue this warning , given my general respect for the University of Pittsburgh to the point where I once even tried to land a faculty position there .
His announcement strikes me as being rash in the extreme , especially given that its text even admits outright that the published data at present do not appear to support a link between cell phone use and brain tumors .
Consequently , I conclude that this is alarmism that , I suspect , even a prominent blogger known to be somewhat receptive to the claim that cell phones cause brain tumors ( Revere ) would have a hard time supporting , because it goes far beyond the published evidence and is based on “ early unpublished data . ”
Scaring the nation based on “ early unpublished data ” that ca n’t be examined by the entire medical and scientific community is generally not a good idea .
That ’s why I ’ve been asking over the last few days :
Why on earth did Dr. Herberman do it ?
The question of whether cell phones cause or contribute to the development of brain tumors is not as easy a question to answer as one might think .
Indeed , I suspect that the very difficulty of answering the question is what contributes to the amount of woo that has come to surround the whole issue of cell phones , complete with useless “ cell phone shields ” and various other devices that will supposedly obviate any risks , whether real or not .
First , there is the issue of biological plausibility .
Radiowave energy at the power level used by most cell phones , is not ionizing .
It ’s not even close , being several orders of magnitude too weak to break chemical bonds .
Our understanding of cancer is that , in general , ionizing radiation is what is required for radiation to cause or contribute to cancer .
That does not mean that there might not be a potential , as yet undiscovered , mechanism by which non-ionizing radiation might cause cancer , but simple physics and chemistry make the hypothesis that cell phone radiation causes or contributes to brain tumors not particularly plausible on the basis of currently understood biology .
Too , we can actually test radiofrequency radiation in the same power range used in cell phones on cells in cell culture in order to determine whether exposure to such radiation can cause changes associated with malignant transformation .
There is one confounding effect that has to be controlled for in such experiments ( but is not always ) , namely that radiofrequency radiation interacts with water in order to heat it .
Still , there are no compelling studies showing any specific effect of radiofrequency radiation on cells to induce changes associated with malignant transformation , at least none that I ’m aware of .
Animal studies are prone to the same sorts of problems as cell culture studies , but even so there is no good quality animal data that I ’m aware of implicating cell phone radiation in the formation of cancer .
On a basic science basis , at present there does n’t appear to be strong evidence ( or much of any evidence at all ) supporting plausible mechanism by which cell phone radiofrequency radiation might cause cancer or an actual effect in which they do .
Another form of evidence that might be suggestive that cell phones are causing cancer would be in the form of pure incidence data .
Cell phones were first introduced into the U.S. in the 1980s , but their use did n’t become widespread until the late 1990s , mainly because before that they were too expensive , bulky , and generally unreliable .
I got my first cell phone in 1997 , and the thing was a brick , with high per-minute charges and really high charges for roaming or long distance .
In fact , it was n’t long before I wondered why I bought the damned thing and signed up for a three year–yes , three year –contract , given how little I ended up using it .
In any case , we might expect that , if cell phones were causing brain tumors , there might be a generalized spike in the number of cases of brain tumors recently .
There has n’t been any such dramatic increase over the thirty year period from 1975 - 2005 .
Of course , we may not have been using cell phones widely for long enough to see the increase , given that the lag time from an exposure to the development of cancer is often two decades .
That brings us to epidemiological studies .
For us to consider any epidemiological to be support for the hypothesis that cell phones cause brain cancer , there must be a few key results .
First , there must be an increased incidence of brain cancer in cell phone users .
It ’s even more convincing if there is some sort of dose - response phenomenon .
In other words , there should be an increasing risk of cancer that is strongly correlated with increasing cell phone use .
Other results that also support the hypothesis would be tumors correlated with proximity .
In other words , do people who primarily use their left hand to hold their phones to their ears tend to get tumors primarily on the left and people who primarily hold their phones with their right hand tend to get tumors primarily on the right ?
Finally , there should be a plausible lag time between exposure and tumor development consistent with known lag times for cancer , say 10 - 20 years , and some specificity .
In other words , does exposure to cell phone radiation correlate with certain types of tumors and not others ?
There are other aspects of the results of a study that can more strongly support the hypothesis that cell phones cause brain cancer , but these are the main ones .
In general , however , getting “ clean ” data from an epidemiologic study of cell phone use that can support a strong enough correlation to suggest causation is very difficult indeed .
In order to correlate cell phone use with an increased incidence of brain tumors , it ’s necessary somehow to be able to reliably quantify cell phone usage .
This presents a big problem .
It ’s generally not possible to continuously observe people with their cell phones for years on end and obtain objective measurements , and certainly it ’s not impossible to do so for people who have brain cancer now and whose exposure ten or twenty years ago is the possible contributory factor that we are interested in studying .
Another way to try to come by this information is to ask people how much they use their cell phones .
However , memories are unreliable , and such methods are very prone to recall bias in the form of people with brain tumors being more likely to remember their cell phone use as having been “ heavy . ”
That ’s not even counting trying to control of the number of potentially confounding factors , such as heavy cell phone use being associated with certain jobs or professions or , especially for 10 - 20 years ago when cell phones were far less common , with higher socioeconomic status , or even region of the country , given the uneven penetration of cell phone technology out from the urban areas that were covered first–especially 10 - 20 years ago .
Then there ’s the shift in technology from analog to digital cell phone technology that occurred in the early 2000s , which changed the power and frequencies used .
There are ways to overcome the limitations of retrospective studies .
For example , an investigator can try to look at cell phone bills and see the number of minutes used per month , but who keeps their bills from 10 or 20 years ago , which is the time of exposure most relevant to the development of cancer ?
Alternatively , one can abandon the retrospective study altogether and follow people prospectively and have them report their cell phone usage from their bills every month .
However , because brain tumors represent an uncommon form of cancer , thousands upon thousands of subjects would have to be followed this way , and it would take at least a decade or two to start to see any results .
Also , it would be very hard to find and enforce a viable control group , given the ubiquity of cell phones .
Despite the difficulties , several epidemiological studies have been done , with largely negative results .
Surprisingly , the NPR report actually summarizes them pretty well ; so I do n’t see a compelling reason to do anything other than quote the article :
The issue that concerns some scientists — though nowhere near a consensus — is electromagnetic radiation , especially its possible effects on children .
It is not a major topic in conferences of brain specialists .
A 2008 University of Utah analysis looked at nine studies — including some Herberman cites — with thousands of brain tumor patients and concludes “ we found no overall increased risk of brain tumors among cellular phone users .
The potential elevated risk of brain tumors after long - term cellular phone use awaits confirmation by future studies . ”
Studies last year in France and Norway concluded the same thing .
“ If there is a risk from these products — and at this point we do not know that there is — it is probably very small , ” the Food and Drug Administration says on an agency Web site .
And :
A French study based on Interphone research and published in 2007 concluded that regular cell phone users had “ no significant increased risk ” for three major types of nervous system tumors .
It did note , however , that there was “ the possibility of an increased risk among the heaviest users ” for one type of brain tumor , but that needs to be verified in future research .
Earlier research also has found no connection .
Our fearless leader Steve Novella also summarized the state of the evidence regarding cell phone use and the risk of cancer and concluded that we can probably rule out a strong correlation between cell phone radiation and cancer , but we do not yet have enough data to rule out a small increased risk of brain tumors due to cell phones , particularly in children .
I mostly agree with this characterization of the state of the evidence at present , which is why I find statements like this to be overblown fear - mongering :
A driving force behind the memo was Devra Lee Davis , the director of the university ’s center for environmental oncology .
“ The question is do you want to play Russian roulette with your brain , ” she said in an interview from her cell phone while using the hands - free speaker phone as recommended .
“ I do n’t know that cell phones are dangerous .
But I do n’t know that they are safe . ”
I think that a friend of mine , PalMD , got it right when he sarcastically retorted :
Hey , I do n’t know for an absolute certainty that my popcorn wo n’t spontaneously combust , but I ’m not yelling fire either .
To which I ’d add : Hey , I do n’t know with absolute certainty that vaccines do n’t cause autism , but I ’m not joining the anti-vaccinationists or planning to head off to the second annual “ Green Our Vaccines ” rally next year as a speaker .
( Do n’t worry ; it ’ll never happen unless anti-vaccine activists can provide evidence at least as compelling as the evidence that vaccines are safe . )
The actual warning is even worse , delving into some truly dubious comparisons :
In the early 1980 ’s , the owners of asbestos mines were reduced to bankruptcy as a result of lawsuits brought by the families of deceased exposed workers .
A few years later , a key executive of Johns Manville , the most prominent company , drew lessons from the years of struggle of his industry against medical data and the scientists who were drawing attention to the risks of asbestos .
He concluded with regret that greater warnings for the public , the establishment of more effective precautions , and more extensive medical research “ could have saved lives , and probably also shareholders , the industry , and the benefits of its product . ” [ 13 , 14 ]
We call on the cell phone companies to provide independent access to records of use so that appropriate studies can be carried out .
I do n’t know about you , but personally I would n’t want investigators combing through my cell phone records without my permission .
Of course , it ’s hard to see what investigators would do with such data ; after all , it would n’t be hard to get study participants to agree to give permission to examine their cell phone records , and in that case there would be no need for cell phone companies to provide “ independent ” access to anything .
If investigators are planning on using aggregate ecological data instead of subject - level data , for instance , to try to correlate regions of where cell phone use is heavy with regions where the incidence of brain tumors is higher , then there would be a very high danger of falling prey to the ecological fallacy of epidemiology which is a principle that states that ecological ( or group level ) analyses are particularly prone to false positive correlations , as happened with this study and this study .
Worse , earlier in the report there was even a comparison with tobacco !
Here ’s the difference that makes these comparisons specious .
Tobacco smoke is a known carcinogen .
We have many in vitro and animal studies that allow us to elucidate the mechanisms by which its components can induce lung cancer and other forms of cancer .
Similarly , although the mechanism of how asbestos induces cancer is not as clear , we similarly have animal studies that show that asbestos can indeed induce characteristic cancers .
In marked contrast , we have no such studies showing biological plausibility for cell phone radiation .
That ’s why even bringing up the comparison strikes me more as poisoning the well more than anything else .
As Steve Novella points out , how do we know that a better comparison is n’t silicone breast implants , which were initially thought to be associated with autoimmune diseases but were later exonerated by the science–but not before Dow Chemicals was bankrupted by lawsuits in the 1990s ?
We do n’t .
We need more science .
Premature warnings can be almost as bad as warnings that come too late .
Particularly strange is Davis ’s statement :
She said 20 different groups have endorsed the advice the Pittsburgh cancer institute gave , and authorities in England , France and India have cautioned children ’s use of cell phones .
As PalMD astutely pointed out , these 20 groups did not actually endorse UPCC ’s report ; rather they endorsed recommendations similar to the recommendations in the report .
The recommendations are not too far out there , although they are probably more cautious than current evidence warrants .
I later discovered that Dr. Herberman gave an interview with The Cancer Letter that was published shortly after he issued his warning :
The [ Interphone ] study was completed and analyzed over two years ago , but “ the frustration is , it has not been published yet , ” Herberman said .
“ I ’ve talked with several people who are experts , and everyone I ’ve talked to who has seen the data say there is clearly at least a two - fold increase in tumors on the side of the head where the cell phone tends to be used .
Even if this characterization of the Interphone study is completely accurate , I still ca n’t figure out what on earth possessed Dr. Herberman to allow it to be issued now .
Even if the unpublished data are as alarming as implied ( unlikely , given the number of previous studies that found either no risk or a questionable very slight risk and the low number of brain tumors seen in the U.S. each year to begin with ) and the National Research Council in the U.S. is mistaken about its being highly skewed due to selection bias , as a responsible leader in public health and cancer , you do n’t pull something like this .
It ’s irresponsible .
A few months to get the data published in a peer - reviewed journal or , if that ’s taking too long , presented at a major meeting ( where the peer review process is usually less rigorous for abstracts ) are not going to make a difference , given the long lag time of cancer .
After all , cancer is a disease that develops over years , and even under the worst - case scenario , hypotheses for cell phone use causing cancer postulate years of heavy use as being necessary to result in cancer .
Waiting until the data can be published would at least allow scientists and physicians to vet the data and decide if , on balance taking into account its limitations , it warrants such a strong warning .
Alternatively , if you really believe you can’t wait a few months because the risk is so compelling , then release the data with the warning , so that scientists can judge whether the warning is warranted .
Of course , that the study authors are having trouble getting their results published makes me wonder whether their findings are as strong as advertised in this warning .
No doubt the conspiracy crowd will claim that cell phone companies are somehow “ suppressing ” the evidence , but nothing ’s stopping the authors from publishing their data and conclusions on an open access journal like Public Library of Science Medicine .
Doing so would make the data public much faster , and I urge the study authors to consider this option ; that is , if getting the data out where it can be evaluated by the cancer community is more important than publishing it in the New England Journal of Medicine .
Fortunately , many Americans seem to have more common sense than our cancer leaders :
“ I think if they gave me specific numbers and specific information and it was scary enough , I would be concerned , ” Loughran said , planning to call her mother again in a matter of minutes .
“ Without specific numbers , it ’s too vague to get me worked up . ”
I could n’t have said it better myself .
In the meantime while we ’re waiting for the data to be published , I hope my boss is n’t one of Dr. Herberman ’s golfing buddies .

This book outlines the consequences of the destruction of the two - parent family and the need to stabilize it by strengthening its weakest natural link , the role of the biological father .
It is written from a secular perspective and includes a few things with which the owner of the FishEaters Website would definitely quibble , and it does n't even mention the importance of chastity on the part of men , too , which is sad .
But it most certainly makes its case about the need for patriarchy , destroying the Victorian myth of women being innocent , sexless little fluffballs in the process -- a quite necessary destruction in that reaching the goal of chastity should n't be based on lies and pious tales about the reality of human nature -- women being a little more than half of all humans .
Failure to deal with actual human nature , rather than sentimentalized versions of it , can only lead to failure , resentment , neuroses , and backlash .
At any rate , this book is must - reading for all who are concerned about the future of Western civilization -- and is definitely the book to give to the radical feminist who decries " the evils of the patriarchy " ( which is not at all to belittle real evils suffered by women at the hands of those with sentimentalized , condescending , nasty attitudes towards them , or by the very small sub - set of men who actually do behave like brutes toward women ) .
Just think of what our world is like in the West -- the Maury Povich " Who My Baby Daddy " shows with the paternity tests given to ten different men in an attempt to find out who a child 's father is , the newspaper birth announcements which amount to lists of names of single women .
Think of the women , bewildered about why men wo n't commit , and the men who'd love to commit , but know that doing so is to risk being raped by the judicial system because of no - fault divorce and unjust custody and alimony laws .
Consider our " pornified " culture in which women compete to " out - slut " each other in how they dress and in what they 're willing to do to arouse men and get and keep their attention -- men who likely refer to them as " pump and dumps " and will never call them again after sex that most likely was n't fully physically satisfying for them in the first place .
Think of how a rating scale exists out there , with women being judged as being a " 4 " or a " solid 9 , " all based on their " hotness , " with no regard for their intellects , hearts , dreams , and souls .
How far we 've fallen .
Pope Paul VI nailed it way back in 1968 when he wrote , in Humanae Vitae , about the effects of artificial contraception :
Responsible men can become more deeply convinced of the truth of the doctrine laid down by the Church on this issue if they reflect on the consequences of methods and plans for artificial birth control .
Let them first consider how easily this course of action could open wide the way for marital infidelity and a general lowering of moral standards .
Not much experience is needed to be fully aware of human weakness and to understand that human beings — and especially the young , who are so exposed to temptation — need incentives to keep the moral law , and it is an evil thing to make it easy for them to break that law .
Another effect that gives cause for alarm is that a man who grows accustomed to the use of contraceptive methods may forget the reverence due to a woman , and , disregarding her physical and emotional equilibrium , reduce her to being a mere instrument for the satisfaction of his own desires , no longer considering her as his partner whom he should surround with care and affection .
And think of what modern sexual mores have done to relations between the sexes .
We have vast campus bureaucracies that deny young men of due process when they 're accused of " rape , " where " rape " can mean absolutely anything a female wants it to mean .
We have incredible confusion , pain , and regret stemming from the fact that our culture fails to affirm the simple facts that men and women are different , that our bodies are radically different , and that the biological , psychological , and sociological consequences of sex are radically different for us .
From an article by Heather Mac Donald at City Journal : The New York Times now has a “ gender editor ” and “ gender team , ” created in the wake of the # MeToo movement to infuse feminist sensibility even further throughout the paper .
The gender editor , Jessica Bennett , penned an op - ed last month that serves as a template for the hypocritical state of modern feminism .
Bennett had unforced sex with a 30 - year - old acquaintance when she was 19 because “ saying ‘ yes ’ [ was ] easier than saying ‘ no , ’ ” as the op - ed ’s title puts it .
She allowed the encounter to proceed out of “ some combination of fear ( that I was n’t as mature as he thought ) , shame ( that I had let it get this far ) , and guilt ( would I hurt his feelings ? ) . ”
Naturally , Bennett attributes her passivity and embarrassment at that moment to “ dangerously outdated gender norms . ”
It is the patriarchy , she claims , that makes “ even seemingly straightforward ideas about sex — such as , you know , whether we want to engage in it or not — feel utterly complex . ”
Actually , it is not the patriarchy that makes sexual decisions “ utterly complex ” ; it is sex itself .
Sex is the realm of the inarticulate and irrational , inherently fraught with “ fear , ” “ shame , ” and “ guilt . ”
Sexual seduction is carried on through ambiguity and indirection ; exposing that ambiguity to light , naming what may or may not be going on , is uncomfortable and risks denial and rejection .
“ Dangerously outdated gender norms ” are not what make it difficult to say no to sexual advances ; contemporary gender norms have confused these already fraught situations .
Traditional mores set the default for premarital sex at “ no , ” at least for females .
This default recognized the different sexual drives of males and females and the difficulties of bargaining with the male libido .
The default “ no ” to premarital sex meant that a female did not have to negotiate the refusal with every opportuning male ; it was simply assumed .
She could , of course , cast aside the default assumption ; that was her power and prerogative .
But she did not have to provide reasons for shutting down a sexual advance .
Sexual liberation reversed those default settings .
The default is now “ yes ” to premarital sex ; it is a “ no ” that has to be extricated in media res .
No cultural taboos remain around premarital sex ; those represented a repressive version of female sexuality , declared the liberationists .
Males and females are now assumed to pursue sexual conquest with equal zeal .
A contributor to the website Total Sorority Move described an instance of drunken college coitus several years ago that she , like the Times ’ Bennett , allowed to happen simply because stopping it would have involved providing reasons .
“ We have sex with guys , because sometimes it ’s just easier to do it than to have the argument about not doing it , ” observed Veronica Ruckh .
Ruckh quotes other females who have been defeated by the “ yes ” default for sex : “ To be honest , it would have been awkward to say no , so I just did it . ”
“ Sometimes you have to have lunch with girls you do n’t want to have lunch with , and sometimes you have to have sex with boys you do n’t want to have sex with . ”
This state of affairs would have been unthinkable 60 years ago .
Then , there was no cultural compulsion to have “ sex with boys you did n’t want to have sex with . ”
The assumption was that of course you would not , and that assumption gave females power to control the outcome .
Now , however , females have to go mano a mano with the male libido in a realm filled with indirection , embarrassment , and uncertainty .
The male libido will win in many of those cases .
Feminists cannot acknowledge the divide between men and women when it comes to sex and sensibility .
Doing so would violate what Steven Pinker calls the blank slate doctrine , a foundation stone of modern liberalism .
One of that doctrine ’s core tenets is that “ differences between men and women have nothing to do with biology but are socially constructed in their entirety , ” in Pinker ’s words .
Ignoring biology , feminists recast difficult sexual interactions in terms of power and politics .
Sexual harassment , real or imagined , is portrayed as an effort to subordinate females .
Actually , sexual harassment is usually just about sex , even if differential power is used to obtain it .

Read the book below and think about it ...
Key senators announced Monday a bipartisan agreement on the broad elements of a plan to avoid foreclosures and speed the refinancing of mortgages for roughly 500,000 troubled homeowners without taxpayers footing the bill .
The deal , full details of which were not spelled out , reflects the election - year pressure that lawmakers feel to find common ground on one of the most pressing issues facing the country .
The housing collapse has inflicted pain on thousands of families , dealt the economy a major blow and ignited a fierce controversy over what -- if anything -- the government should do about it .
Despite the agreement , the measure still faces substantial hurdles : passage by the full Senate ; approval by the House , which has its own home rescue plan ; and signature by President Bush , who has threatened to veto the House ’s version .
The lead Republican on the Senate Banking Committee , Sen. Richard C. Shelby ( R - Ala . ) , expressed optimism that a new financing arrangement agreed to Monday would attract more support from his Republican colleagues , who have voiced concern about any measure that could be seen as a government bailout of speculators .

“ My primary consideration during negotiations on this package has been to protect the American taxpayer , and I believe we ’ve made significant progress toward that goal , ” Shelby said in a statement .
Some Republicans have supported other versions of the legislation , citing the severity of the housing crisis and the escalating number of foreclosures in some regions of the country , including parts of California .
They argued that the foreclosure crisis would damage entire communities and pull the economy toward recession .
But other Republicans argued against any government assistance , saying it would reward borrowers and lenders who made bad decisions out of carelessness or greed .
Shelby was considered a key player because he belonged to the latter group .
“ I ’ve long said that we should do what we can to help struggling homeowners , short of asking the taxpayer to foot the bill , ” he said Monday .

White House reaction to the emerging deal was muted .
In public comments , Bush did not repeat his previous veto threat , saying only that “ we look forward to working with Congress to get a good piece of legislation to my desk that helps our fellow citizens and helps us get through this housing issue . ”
The Senate plan announced by Shelby and Banking Committee Chairman Sen. Christopher J. Dodd ( D - Conn . ) is similar to the House - passed bill in that the centerpiece of each is an expansion of government mortgage insurance .
Under both proposals , a borrower facing foreclosure could refinance into a government - guaranteed mortgage under certain conditions , including that the home is the owner ’s primary residence and that the holder of the existing mortgage accepts 85 % of the home ’s current appraised value as payment in full .
The House bill calls for using about $ 1.7 billion from the federal budget to set up the program , which would be administered by the Federal Housing Administration .
Under the Senate deal , the start - up funds would come instead from an affordable - housing fund capitalized by mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , which were created by the government but are owned by public stockholders .

“ This legislation is good news for both the markets and homeowners , ” Dodd said .
“ The bill addresses the root of our current economic problems -- the foreclosure crisis -- by creating a voluntary initiative at no estimated cost to taxpayers , which will help Americans keep their homes . ”
Dodd told reporters the measure would speed the correction of housing prices to return stability to the market as soon as possible and prevent further damage to the broader economy .
“ Obviously , we want to keep as many people as possible in their homes .
But the second goal , as important as the first , is to get to the floor ” of the housing correction , Dodd said in a conference call .
“ Until we get to the floor , none of this is going to get better . ”
White House spokesman Tony Fratto said the administration would look carefully at the plan once it was formally approved by the Senate Banking Committee , which it could do as soon as today .

“ We want to ensure that FHA expansion is done in a responsible and effective way , ” Fratto said .
The legislation also would create a new oversight structure , long sought by the administration , designed to ensure that Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac and the Federal Home Loan Bank system remain financially sound .
Other aspects of the House version of the legislation , including tax credits for first - time home buyers and federal support for mortgage counseling , were to be taken up by the Banking committee today .
“ We have a lot of confidence that this is what the market is waiting for , ” Dodd said .

The van carrying supplies stopped at the Rafah crossing .
( Eva Barlett )
EXPOSED
Ten days after setting out from Edinburgh , and five days past their projected 15 July arrival , Scottish humanitarian Khalil al - Niss and his wife Linda Willis finally arrived in the afternoon of 20 July to the Rafah crossing on the Gaza - Egypt border only to be denied entry to Gaza .
The Gazan side , just over 100 meters from the Egyptian gate and Israeli - built wall , is visible from where the couple ’s van sits idle ; doctors inside Gaza wait for the expected delivery of essential medical aid .
Having arrived by ferry from Jordan after 11 pm , al - Niss and Willis were made to wait over 24 hours at the border town of Nuweiba , where Egyptian authorities repeatedly sent them to six different departments to fill out form after form .
Once again , the van was unloaded as Egyptian officials inspected its contents to only reload them seemingly satisfied the couple really was bringing in vital medicines and equipment .
“ Egyptian bureaucracy is amazing .
We sat , had tea , filled out forms and were told , ‘ okay , you ’re ready to go now .
Just go over to that office there and fill out one more form , ’ ” Willis told Daily News Egypt .
Just after 1 pm on 20 July they drove into al - Arish , the pair weary but pleased to have made it to their second - to - last destination .
“ We ’re completely exhausted .
Since Wednesday morning until now we ’ve only slept a cumulative 10 hours , ” said Willis .
Willis and al - Niss have driven day and night in a van crammed with urgently - needed medical supplies and equipment to reach northeastern Sinai town of Rafah on the Gaza border .
They are part of a growing trend of international citizens who have decided to help end the Israeli siege on Gaza where residents are denied the most basic necessities — including vital medicines and hospital equipment parts .
Willis , a native of Scotland and al - Niss , a Palestinian from Jerusalem living in Scotland , took time off from their jobs to deliver the medical supplies by first ferrying to Belgium , and then driving through Germany , Austria , and Slovenia .
Although the team anticipated difficulties crossing borders with a van decked out in the Palestinian and Scottish flags and filled with medicines , they had n’t expected a flat - out denial of entry .
Arriving at Croatia ’s border , the pair was refused entry , causing them to backtrack and alter their route , driving instead through Romania , Hungary and Bulgaria to cross via Turkey two days later .
Turkish authorities also initially turned the van away , yet eventually relented some 17 hours later , having partially unloaded and searched the van ’s contents , and permitting the van to pass .
“ I was surprised , ” Willis explained , “ because Turkey is a Muslim country and I had thought they would support and empathize with Gaza . ”
Thankfully for the pair , travel was easier after Turkey .
“ Syria was fantastic , ” al - Niss said , praising the country ’s aid in expediting travel through and on to Jordan .
“ Syrian authorities even provided us with a security convoy , all the way to the border . ”
In Jordan , the duo once again faced excessive red tape and an unwillingness to allow them passage , a reticence which again surprised them given Jordan ’s large population of Palestinian refugees .
After again partially unloading the van , four hours later they were allowed to pass and boarded a ferry bound for Egypt .
Greater Obstacles
Khalil al - Niss and Linda Willis at the Rafah crossing .
( Eva Bartlett )
“ It ’s just been such a long journey .
It would be fantastic if we could enter and deliver the medicine , save some lives , ” Willis explained .
“ But I do n’t think it will be easy , I think we ’ll need to get help from our Scottish Parliamentarians . ”
Arriving at 2 pm at Rafah ’s closed gates , Willis and al - Niss were told they must first return to al - Arish to fill out border - crossing forms with officials based there before their crossing into Gaza would be considered .
The two , having been on the road for 10 days and already having faced days of bureaucracy and waiting , refused to leave the area , afraid that roadblocks might prevent their re-entry the following day .
After a warning from Egyptian authorities that the area in front of the border was now a closed military area forbidden to foreigners , the couple relented , leaving the van parked at the border crossing , waiting to enter and deliver the goods .
Willis , a nurse in Scotland , explained the coordination with Gaza ’s doctors : ” We spoke with a doctor in one of Gaza ’s hospitals .
He ’s desperate for the medicine and equipment we ’re bringing .
He ’s particularly thrilled about the endotracheal tubes used in surgery that we are bringing as he says they are re-using the only tubes they have right now . ”
The van also carries desperately - needed medication for heart conditions and diabetes , as well as syringes , bandages , swabs and antibiotics .
An Egyptian humanitarian who wished to withhold his name traveled to the border to support the Scottish effort condemned what he called the complicity of the Egyptian government in the siege .
“ Egypt shares in this crime , ” he said .
“ The officers here denying you entry are taking orders from higher powers . ”
Impact of siege
The Gaza - based Popular Committee Against the Siege ( PCAS ) last reported the number of victims who had died preventable deaths as a result of unattainable medical care under the siege as 212 , the latest two victims including an 11 - month - old infant and a 44 - year - old father of eight .
Both died after being denied permits to exit Gaza for treatment .
PCAS lists 107 classes of basic medicines that are depleted in Gaza , 97 more nearing depletion , 136 halted or not functioning medical instruments and over 1,500 patients who need to leave the Strip for medical treatment .
Despite the 19 June agreement to halt Israeli military operations , invasions , and indiscriminate shelling on Gaza , in return for an end to the launching of homemade rockets from Gaza towards Israel , Israel has not met its obligations in opening the borders with Gaza and allowing in adequate amounts of food , medical supplies , construction materials , fuel , and other vital elements denied to the civilian population for over one year .
Instead , the opening of Rafah , and the passage of goods into Gaza via other crossings , has been put on hold , used as a bargaining tool for the release of the Israeli solider being held in Gaza , even though his release was not part of the ceasefire agreement .
Willis and al - Niss remain hopeful that they will enter and bear witness , deliver aid and a message that the siege is inhumane , and if the international political community wo n’t do anything to end it , civilians will .
Their success may be echoed by the efforts of a team of over 50 internationals , including Israelis , who aim to reach Gaza ’s coast by sea next month .
Holocaust survivor Hedy Epstein , an organizer of the Free Gaza Movement to break the siege by boat , hopes like Willis and al - Niss , to “ remind the world that we will not stand by and watch 1.5 million people suffer [ to ] death by starvation and disease . ”

GRAND MEADOW TOWNSHIP , Minn . —
It is n’t every day a structure the size of a 38 - story building rises from Jeanette Curley ’s bean fields .
Digital camera in hand , Curley watched as workers in hard hats hosed off wind turbine blades to get them ready to be hoisted onto a steel stalk looming above the soybeans .
She was n’t going to miss this .
The Grand Meadow Wind Farm — the first wind project Xcel Energy will own and operate in Minnesota — was ready to top off a turbine looming over her Mower County farm .
Minneapolis - based Xcel is stitching together a wind farm roughly six miles long and four miles wide just south of Interstate 90 , about 27 miles southwest of Rochester .
Eventually Grand Meadow will hold 67 turbines , capable of producing 100 megawatts of power , enough to supply 33,000 homes .
On this gorgeous August day , Curley can see finished and half - finished wind turbines in every direction .
The finished ones looked like giant pinwheels while the half - finished towers wait for a Paul Bunyan to slip on their whirligigs .
Curley , 54 , and her husband Wayne agreed to allow two of the 1.5 megawatt turbines on their 240 - acre farm , which has been in Wayne ’s family since the Great Depression .
The decision did n’t come overnight .
The Curleys were first approached about a wind farm in 2001 .
At first they were skeptical , she says .
“ People are always coming into town to sell farmers something . ”
But unlike some of those folks , the developers for what would become Grand Meadow did n’t disappear after they made their pitch .
EnXco , the renewable - energy company that managed the wind farm development for Xcel , was persistent .
As time went by , the Curleys began to realize wind energy was n’t a fad .
Wayne , who was on the township board for 27 years , rallied farmers to the project .
He would have loved to have seen this , Jeanette Curley said .
Wayne died in a farm accident last fall .
“ My husband is the one .
He really pushed this .
To get all those farmers on one wavelength … ” her voice trailed off .
“ I ’m just ecstatic .
It ’s just unbelievable . ”
Xcel will need to find a lot more Wayne Curleys in the years ahead .
PLUGGING IN
In terms of the power it produces , 100 - megawatt Grand Meadow is small compared to the plants Xcel is used to building , like the 750 - megawatt coal plant under construction at a cost of $ 1.3 billion in Colorado .
But there are many more wind farms than coal plants in Xcel ’s future , especially in Minnesota .
The company now gets less than 5 percent of its energy from wind in Minnesota , but by 2020 , must produce 30 percent of its power from renewable sources to reduce dependence upon dirty coal .
At least 25 percent of that clean energy must come from wind .
That translates into roughly 3,000 megawatts of wind - produced energy that Xcel will have to buy or build in the next 12 years .
Put another way , that ’s roughly 2,000 wind turbines .
To begin to meet that need , Xcel put out a request for proposals last December for 500 more megawatts of wind energy that could be available by 2011 , and got responses for 22 projects in Minnesota , North and South Dakota and Iowa .
The proposals add up to more than 3,000 megawatts of wind from which Xcel can choose , according to a plan it filed earlier this month with the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission .
But there are challenges that could slow the work .
Negotiations with property owners , usually for long - term leases , can take years .
For Jeanette Curley , who now rents out her land to someone else to farm , the extra income ( which she declined to specify ) for allowing two turbines is welcome .
But not everyone with property in the Grand Meadow project area decided to participate .
Jim Fuller , 84 , of Austin , said he supports wind energy .
But the developers told him that because of the slope in his 400 acres in Grand Meadow , only two turbines would work on it .
Fuller and his business partner rent their land to a farmer , and said they decided the $ 5,000 they were offered per turbine per year was n’t worth the lost crop production and hassle of his farmer plowing around the access roads and site , so they passed .
“ No hard feelings , no problems , ” he said .
Another issue : a federal tax credit that encourages development of wind power and other forms of renewable energy is set to expire at the end of this year .
If Congress does n’t extend it when it returns to session in September , the loss of the production tax credit will bring work on most wind farm projects across the country to a halt .
Finally , the state and entire wind industry is wrestling with inadequate transmission capacity .
Southeast Minnesota and the region called Buffalo Ridge on the west end of I - 90 are rich with wind energy potential but there ’s a bottleneck getting that electricity to urban areas that need the power such as the Twin Cities .
Xcel is proposing changes to speed up approval for new transmission lines , but in the meantime will add five 34.5 kilovolt power lines in the Grand Meadow area .
The five lines will carry power from the 67 turbines to a substation , where a single 161 - kilovolt line will run to another substation that plugs into the region ’s power grid , said Nathan Svoboda , Xcel ’s plant manager .
EnXco , the U.S. arm of a French energy company , will run the farm for its first two years , as it teaches Xcel employees wind farm maintenance .
Then it will hand it off , said Svoboda .
HEAVY BALLET
Wind power is new to Svoboda .
Previously , he worked at an Xcel garbage - burning plant in Mankato and before that , at a coal plant in Rapid City , S.D. , for Black Hills Power Co .
Construction of the farm has been quick .
The gravel access roads and concrete foundations were laid before Svoboda arrived in July and the workers , from Mortenson Construction in Minnetonka , topped off 37 turbines in six weeks .
On some days they finish three or four , he said .
The site is a hive of heavy equipment , pickup trucks and spindly cranes .
“ People are moving in and out almost like a precise ballet , ” said Warren Grieves , enXco ’s spokesman .
Once the foundation is laid , a crane stacks the bottom two tubular steel sections of the tower .
Meantime , workers attach the three blades to the hub on the ground to form the rotor .
For the final stage , a larger crane is rolled in , and the top knuckle of the 253 - foot tower is lifted into place .
Workers bolt it into to the tower with the machine - gun rattle of a pneumatic torque wrench .
The square machine head , called a nacelle , is next .
It ’s 12 feet tall , can be entered by ladder inside the tower for maintenance and lets workers who can stomach the heights climb through a hatch onto the hub outside .
It contains the power generator , and at 62.5 tons , it ’s heavy .
An 18 - wheeler weighs only 40 tons .
The blades , by comparison , are considered light .
Made of fiberglass , they weigh only 13,900 pounds apiece , or not quite 7 tons .
The blades and hub get lifted last , very carefully , with guide lines wrapped around the tips to help position the blades .
Folks who live in the area often stop to watch .
Once the turbine is complete , the crane ’s diesel engine roars to life and it begins to creep off like some weird walking tree .
The workers pack up and it ’s off to the next tower .
TAX CREDIT
As long as Grand Meadow is operating by the end of the year , it can claim a federal energy production tax credit for the next 10 years .
Other projects may not be so fortunate .
The renewable energy tax credit costs the country $ 3 billion over 10 years , and it has had to be renewed repeatedly since its creation in 1992 .
During the periods when it has been allowed to expire , wind development dropped by as much as 90 percent , said Gregory Wetstone , senior director for government and public affairs for the American Wind Energy Association ( AWEA ) , a trade group .
Total U.S. installed wind power capacity stands at 19,549 megawatts this year , with new capacity of 2,725 megawatts added so far , according to AWEA , but the pace slowed in the second quarter as nervous developers eyed the calendar .
The association says the country could add up to 7,500 megawatts of wind energy this year if developers get a reason not to suspend projects that may not beat the clock .
AWEA staffers traveled to the Democratic National Convention in Denver last week to push for the tax credit extension and plan to do the same as a sponsor at the Republican National Convention in St.
Paul this week , Wetstone said .
“ I think ( the tax credit ) will eventually be extended , ” he said .
“ The question is when . ”
Meanwhile , Jeanette Curley has a sense of satisfaction , and her picture .
“ This is a wonderful project , ” she said .
Then she laughed .
“ The only problem is it does n’t come with a hookup to run an extension cord out to it . ”

NEW YORK ( AP )  Bank of America ( BAC ) revealed Thursday that it has received subpoenas and requests for information from various state and federal regulators regarding its sale of auction - rate securities .
In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission , the bank said subsidiaries Banc of America Investment Services and Banc of America Securities are cooperating fully with the requests .
Auction - rate securities are bonds whose interest rates are set at periodic auctions , on the basis of bids submitted .
The market collapsed in February amid turmoil in the credit markets .
Regulators have been investigating some banks ' involvement in the sale of the securities .
Earlier Thursday , C itigroup said it reached a settlement with the New York Attorney General and regulators to repurchase $ 7 billion in auction - rate securities and pay $ 100 million in fines .
Regulators claimed the investments were marketed as safe even when banks knew of liquidity risks during the downturn in the credit markets .
According to the SEC filing , four purported class action lawsuits have also been filed against Bank of America on behalf of purchasers of auction - rate securities .
The cases relate to the sale of the investments between May 2003 and February 2008 and allege that the bank violated certain securities laws in regards to its marketing and sale of the securities .
The actions seek unspecified damages and attorneys ' fees .
A related individual federal action as well as several related Financial Industry Regulatory Authority arbitrations have also been filed , the bank said .
A Bank of America representative was not immediately available for comment .
Bank of America shares tumbled $ 1.93 , or 5.8 % , to close at $ 31.52 .
Shares are down about 19 % for the year .

As the human population continues to skyrocket and conditions on planet Earth get ( proportionally ) more troubled , we have heard about a lot of ways we can change our lifestyles to lessen our impact on the biosphere .
Yes , we know that changing our bulbs to CFLs is great ; we know that driving hybrids is great ; we know that reducing , reusing , and recycling are all great .
And they surely are !
However , one essential aspect of our human lives that often does not receive much attention is our diets .
This is rather shocking , too , because whatever else happens , whatever we stick in our lamps or drive , we always need to feed .
And as more and more of us pop up on the planet , Mother Earth is going to have a lot of hungry human mouths to feed .
Your dietary habits –what , where , and even how you eat–are profoundly important when it comes to sustainable living .
I am not an accredited expert on economics , agriculture , or nutrition , but I have done more than my fair share of research on these and other topics ( especially the latter two ) related to sustainable food choices .
In what follows , then , I share some ingredients I have come across in a recipe for an eco-friendly diet .
Eat simply .
Packaged foods that have ingredients lists spanning several sides of the box , with words you cannot pronounce and substances you never thought could exist , are obviously not “ natural ” and can do funky things to your body .
Plus , the more things in your Frankenfood , the more resources required .
Simple eating gives your digestion an easier task and reduces your exposure to potential toxins , too , which ultimately helps keep you healthy .
Choose organic .
Although an organic label does not guarantee good farming or business practices by the company / producer , you can at least be sure that an organic product will have required less chemicals and toxins in order to go from field to table .
Besides reducing pollution going into the biosphere , you also reduce pollution going into yourself with organic foods .
Buy local .
Shipping foods across vast distances has tremendous costs for the environment–from fuels required by the vehicles ( typically refrigerated ) to pollution .
You may love strawberries in January , but if you live in New York , they just are not sustainable !
Buying local goods reduces the miles your food has to travel , plus it supports the local economy .
Or if you cannot find local products , then at least try to choose domestic over imported–say , an apple from Washington instead of New Zealand .
Go vegetarian or vegan .
Believe it or not , about one third ( 35 % ) of the world ’s grain crops , as well as soy , go not to feed humans directly but to feed livestock–usually cattle , whether for dairy or meat or both .
1
These animals also take heavy tolls on water and land .
Vegetarian and vegan lifestyles reduce the amount of livestock and so reduce the amount of these resources we consume … by proxy .
And whatever hype you hear to the contrary ( from the media and even doctors ) , humans can live perfectly health lives without animal products .
In most normal cases , we do not need large amounts of ( animal ) protein ; we do not even need to eat a “ complete ” protein in each meal : new research shows that the body stores proteins throughout the day , so a varied vegetal diet can provide all the proteins you need , and supplements of vitamins D and B - 12 not from animals can make pick up the slack for vegans .
Baby cows need cow ’s milk but humans do not ; after all , most of that beloved vitamin D and calcium are synthetic concoctions added in ( along with all the hormones pumped into the poor cows ) .
Additionally , vegetarian / vegan lifestyles reduce the suffering these animals must endure , whether or not they are ultimately killed for consumption .
A healthy diet can help mitigate the risk of lifestyle diseases , and a vegan diet can also help improve your skin .
Try some “ alternative ” foods .
Yes , wheat bread , tofu , and popcorn may be staples of modern diets , but some of the staples we eat are not really that good for the planet .
For example , corn ( which is in EVERYTHING – think of corn syrup by itself–and is botanically a grain ) sucks nitrogen out of the soil like mad and so usually requires tons of ( chemical ) fertilizers ; it is also usually grown as a monoculture , which only increases the toll it takes on the soil ( and increases the need for pesticides ! ) .
Soy and wheat are other modern mainstays , but they are also hard on the soil for similar reasons .
You can get away from these resource - hungry food crops by choosing other , lesser known , less demanding foods .
Some examples of grains that are easy on the Earth include millet ( the yellow stuff you find in bird food ; it is actually very good for us , too … I love it ! ) , quinoa , and buckwheat .
Also helpful are plants that have many edible parts : pumpkins , for example , have edible fruits , leaves , and even flowers ; and dandelions have edible leaves , roots good for tea , and flowers used for wine .
Grow it yourself .
Having your own vegetable garden , maybe even with other fun stuff like sunflowers and fruit bushes or trees , is a priceless way to enjoy nature and feed yourself .
A productive little plot is the acme of going local and , if you go organic , then it is also supremely healthy for you and the Earth ( and the critters that will be feasting along with you ! ) .
You can save money on grocery expenses , learn about how food grows and nature works , and fill your belly with food that is made more nutritious by the love and care you bring to your gardening .
Make it yourself .
No matter how hectic your schedule , you can easily plan ahead and “ brown bag ” wherever you go .
When you make your own meals and snacks , you can prepare healthier meals , reduce packaging , and save money .
For instance , just pop a salad and a bagel in a big dish for lunch , or for a snack take some dried fruit and nuts .
If you plan ahead and give up an addiction to “ convenience , ” you will find it easy to be your own Emeril Lagasse or Julia Childs … and remember June Cleaver sending the Beaver off with his nice little bag of lunch ???
Give thanks .
Whether you say “ grace ” or simply pause to reflect on the things that make possible your act of eating , taking a moment to thank the Earth and its collaborators for the food nourishing you is a great way to cultivate respect for the planet and make eating holistically healthier .
Food is a blessing , and blessing your food only increases your mindfulness of how all life is interconnected and interdependent .
These are just some ingredients you can include in your own recipe for a sustainable , eco-friendly diet .
Get creative , be adventurous , add your own spices , and find ways to change from a “ modern ” diet to a sustainable diet where you can .
Whatever other sacrifices going green may entail , you can still eat , drink , and be merry … if you educate yourself and dine with heart !
Yummy , indeed !

Silvio Berlusconi's government was today engaged in a vigorous damage limitation exercise after Pope Benedict appeared to lend his immense moral authority to speculation that Italy was in danger of returning to fascism under the tycoon 's hardline , rightwing leadership .
In his customary midday Sunday address , the pontiff expressed concern at " recent examples of racism " and reminded Catholics it was their duty to steer others in society away from " racism , intolerance and [ the ] exclusion [ of others ] " .
On any other day , his remarks might have been seen as no more than a restatement of official Catholic doctrine .
But they came instead in the midst of a furious dispute over an editorial published by Italy 's bestselling Catholic weekly , Famiglia Cristiana .
In an editorial on Friday , condemning recent government moves against immigrants and Roma , the magazine said it was to be hoped fascism was not " resurfacing in our country under another guise " .
The jibe outraged Berlusconi 's supporters , many of whom are themselves pious Catholics .
The leader of his parliamentary group in the upper house , Maurizio Gasparri , announced he would personally sue the priest who is Famiglia Cristiana 's editor while the junior minister with responsibility for family affairs , Carlo Giovanardi , said the magazine was " possessed by ideological malice " .
In an effort to calm the row , the Vatican 's spokesman put out a statement stressing that Famiglia Cristiana was not authorised to speak on behalf of either the Holy See or the Italian bishops ' conference - something which , as the magazine 's editor noted , it had never anyway claimed to do .
Coming against this background , the pope 's comments were interpreted by Berlusconi 's critics as a signal that the Vatican was not climbing down or distancing itself from Famiglia Cristiana 's interpretation .
Benedict cited in his address the story from Matthew 's gospel of Jesus 's encounter with a pagan woman and how he rose above his initial misgivings to perform a miracle for her daughter .
The pope said : " One of humanity 's great conquests is indeed the overcoming of racism .
Unfortunately , however , there are new and worrying examples of this in various countries , often linked to social and economic problems that nonetheless can never justify contempt or racial discrimination . "
Berlusconi's family minister , Giovanardi , denied Benedict 's words were aimed at the government .
" The pope has a global perspective " , he said .
" He was n't talking about Italy . "
Famiglia Cristiana 's editor , Father Antonio Sciortino , agreed that the pope " was certainly speaking to the whole world " .
But he added : " And therefore also to Italy where , sorry to say , there are many signs of racism that trouble us and which cannot be hidden . "
Urged on by his allies in the anti-immigrant Northern League , Berlusconi has ordered a crackdown on crime , and the illegal immigrants his government says is responsible for a disproportionate share of it .
Earlier this month , the Berlusconi government ordered troops onto the streets to combat an alleged crime wave it blames largely on illegal immigrants and Roma .
Interior ministry figures show that more than a third of the arrests carried out by police last year were of non-Italians .
Illegal immigration has been made an offence ; mayors have been given new security powers , and deportations have been stepped up .
So far , church leaders have been far more outspoken in their criticism of the government 's policies than Italy 's main , centre - left opposition party .
Earlier this month , they succeeded in blocking an attempt by the mayor of Rome to pass a measure - seemingly aimed at Gypsies - that banned people from rummaging in garbage containers .
In June , Famiglia Cristiana said a government plan to take the fingerprints of Roma children was " indecent " .
We 've joked before that GM is " a health care benefits management firm that sells cars for a loss as a side venture . "
Unfortunately , it 's barely a joke .
Well , GM is trying to figure out how to trim its massive $ 5 billion a year healthcare bill .
It 's going to start by making sure its not paying bills for people it should n't be ( Reuters ) :
GM is giving its 67,000 hourly workers until Aug 20 to voluntarily remove ineligible dependents from their health policies , after which , they would have to prove the eligibility of covered - family members through an official document .
If GM learns it is paying for billions in expenses it was n't supposed to , it may ask employees to reimburse it for the costs ( good luck collecting ) .
GM has audited its health - care rolls before , but this effort should be more extensive .
The new policy wo n't stop GM 's multi-billion dollar losses , but at least it 's a step in the right direction .

I ’ve been thinking lately just how much software developers take the existence of version control for granted , and how , with the notable exception of wikipedia , web 2.0 applications do n’t offer much in the way of version control functionality .
( I do n’t really count the kind of change - tracking that is offered in online office programs , especially ones that offer “ accept all changes ” in order to create a clean slate . )
In addition to preventing a collaborating group from overwriting each others ’ changes , version control allows a group to revert a document to any past state , and to see who made a particular change .
These are the capabilities that make wikipedia possible , an innovation even more radical than open source software , in which anyone is trusted to make changes , not just a core group of committers , with the core team moving to a moderation role that is post - commit rather than pre-commit .
I invited Karl Fogel , one of the core developers of subversion , now the most widely - used open source version control system , to join me at the O’Reilly Radar Executive Briefing on Open Source July 24 in Portland .
I wrote :
Seems to me that Subversion ( and the whole idea of version control ) is a
critical part of virtually everything interesting happening these days , from
OSS to wikipedia .
I ’m wondering if you ’d be up for an on - stage
interview about the state of subversion …
Karl replied that he ’d like to talk more about “ version control generally than about
Subversion specifically , ” with the following list of topics as a starting point :
Why it ’s important to be able to search the change history for Wikipedia entries ( and why it ’s incredibly cumbersome using today ’s interface ) ;
Why the U.S. Congress needs real version control tools ( and why it ’s our own fault for not providing them ) ;
Why good version tracking is important in a world where more and more creativity consists of mixing existing things together .
These are really thought - provoking suggestions .
I was particularly struck by Karl ’s suggestion of a version control system for Congress .
They say you do n’t want to see either laws or sausages being made , but I think they are wrong .
Imagine how much more transparency and accountability our government would have if it were possible to see what changes were made by whom , who inserted extraneous riders into various bills , and generally to track the influence of various interests by the new visibility into their actual control over the knobs and levers of government !
I also found Karl ’s comments about the problems with wikipedia ’s version control and version control for a remixable world stimulating .
I ’d love to hear what he has to say about these topics .
Karl also offered to talk about “ insider politics ” , so to speak :
feel free to ask about … the recent Slashdot article pointing to a
blog post in which Linus Torvalds dumps on
Subversion pretty harshly , and explains why the style of version
control he implemented in GIT is better .
Although the presentation itself was rude almost beyond belief , some
of his technical points were valid , and the Subversion developer
community has been good about separating the style from the substance .
There definitely is some substance to Linus ’ comments .
He talked about the importance of support for branching and merging of distinct version lines , the possibility of commits per line of code ( rather than per file ) , and the viability of distributed repositories .
These are definitely forward - looking ideas — and as I noted in my recent entry on the GPL and Software as a Service , we need to be thinking hard about the future of software , and not basing our tools , our licenses , and our development practices on that future .
I often end my talks with a stirring quote from Ray Kurzweil ( which I wrote down at one of his talks at the Foresight conference about five years ago ) :
I ’m an inventor , and I became interested in long term trends because an invention needs to make sense in the world in which it is finished , not the world in which it was started .
Returning to the topic of version control and our legal system … despite the many successes of our form of government , it ’s definitely creaking at the seams .
The founders , for all their foresight , did n’t plan for a nation of 300 million people , most of whom do n’t care to vote , they did n’t foresee the extent to which the bureaucracy would become a fourth seat of power .
I do n’t have any great prescriptions for politics , but I do have prescriptions for technology .
We all need to think hard about how the future will not be like the past , focusing our efforts on that future and being willing to change course when faced with discontinuities that render our past thinking obsolete .
The future we face is one of massive collaborative systems .
How we design those systems , and how we build critical freedoms into them , shaping their architecture to support either participation or centralized control , is one of the great challenges facing the technology community today .
The search for " breakthrough propulsion " may be officially at an end .
First , NASA disbanded the Breakthrough Propulsion Physics program , then it eliminated its vestiges , the NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts , and now it appears the Space Technologies and Applications International Forum could be dead .
According to Tim Ventura , who runs American Antigravity , two of the sections pulled out of STAIF , leading the entire conference to collapse .
The next meeting would have been in 2009 .
I attended part of STAIF in 2005 , spending most of my time there at the " F Section , " which covers " new frontiers and future concepts . "
I listened to people in the session discuss zero point energy , warp drive , antigravity , and other " frontier " concepts , which I wrote about later in a blog post titled " Among the Fringe . "
But STAIF is / was much more than future concepts .
It was actually a federation of six sypmposia that ranged from mainstream to the far , far , far edges of science .
In 2008 , for example , these six areas included :
If STAIF is dead , I think it 's a sad thing ; not because STAIF was good or bad , but because its death ( and it 's life , for that matter ) is probably a symptom of the sorry and confused state of the U.S. government 's commitment to space exploration .

McALLEN , Texas ( AP ) 
The U.S. - Mexico border fence will make life harder on some South Texas farmers , damage valuable wildlife habitat , impair views and generally become an obstacle to border life , the Department of Homeland Security acknowledged in an environmental study of the fence 's impact .
For the people of the Rio Grande Valley , the federal government said in the recent study that there are serious trade - offs for 70 miles of fence segments that will help Border Patrol control illegal immigration and smuggling from Mexico .
But it added that residents will benefit from increased security against " illegal cross - border activity . "
Construction could begin in the valley next week .
" If you live within a mile or so of the river , which is where the fence will be built , you are eternally sentenced to an unsafe existence , " Eagle Pass Mayor Chad Foster , head of the anti-fence Texas Border Coalition , said in a prepared statement .
However , some South Texas denizens will get a break — the fence will include hundreds of holes so the endangered ocelot and jaguarundi can get to the Rio Grande to drink .
The department 's Environmental Stewardship Plan for the Rio Grande Valley was controversial before it was ever released .
DHS drew up the plan after Secretary Michael Chertoff waived environmental studies required by federal law to speed construction of the fence .
As the federal government ramps up efforts to build fencing along the border , Chertoff also has waived environmental laws to build barriers in California and Arizona .
" The Secretary made it clear when he invoked the waiver authority that that by no means meant we would act without some responsible plan , " Customs and Border Protection spokesman Barry Morrissey said .
" The environmental work is still being done . "
RIVER WOES : Border fence in Texas concerns Rio Grande defenders RELIGIOUS FREEDOM :
Tribe says border fence restricts sacred rites Environmental advocates said they had n't fully reviewed the document Tuesday afternoon but said it was a mistake for Chertoff to waive the normal process for vetting projects and minimizing their environmental impact .
" There was a formal process in place for how to go through the ( environmental impact statement ) process and it's something we believe in firmly , " said Oliver Bernstein , spokesman for the Sierra Club in Texas .
" Any attempt to come up with your own fixes we 're going to be very wary of that . "
New maps of the 21 fence segments running through the lower Rio Grande Valley showed very little variation from preliminary maps released last fall .
The new plan does not clarify the issue of access gates in the fence — one of the most frustrating for landowners along the border who wonder how the gates will be operated , if they will be manned and how access could be restricted .
The question is critical for homeowners whose homes and businesses will be left in the no man 's land between the fence and the river .
Without offering details , the plan recognized that the fence will be an obstacle to farmers in terms of access to the land for themselves and their machinery and livestock , and will increase their costs and may decrease the land 's value .
Despite the access holes for the endangered cats , the plan acknowledges that the fence " will likely impact wildlife movement , access to traditional water sources , and potential for gene flow " because some of the species cross the border into Mexico to mate .
Seven segments in Hidalgo County where DHS will build a 15 to 18 - foot concrete wall into the river side of levees will not include the wildlife holes .
The longest of those segments will be just over four miles , the plan said .
Seventeen of the 21 fence sections in the Valley will affect wildlife management areas or national wildlife refuges , 14 of them directly .
Since fence construction will overlap with the migratory bird nesting season , wildlife experts will mark nests in construction 's path and attempt to move them .
Still , the noise from construction could overwhelm birdsongs , making it difficult for some to find mates , according to the plan .
The government will try to avoid cutting down or to transplant mature trees but concedes that it wo n't always be possible .
" Removal will result in long - term major adverse impacts , because these large mature trees are virtually irreplaceable , " the plan said .

The scalability of a service describes how expensive it is to operate as it grows .
The more users access the service , the more expensive it becomes — but how much more expensive ?
The answer to that question is the service ’s scalability .
As we design services , we want them to be as scalable as possible so that their growth results in higher revenue out of proportion with the increase in expenses .
It is possible — in fact , quite easy — to design the opposite kind of service , where growth results in greater expense growth than revenue , and which therefore “ hits a wall ” and can no longer profitably grow .
How do we design services that scale ?

Innovative Solar Cell wins R&D 100 Award
July 28th , 2008 by Michelle Bennett
R&D magazine covers the newest , nerdiest gear from inventors and scientists .
The R&D 100 awards are hailed as the “ Oscars of Invention ” by the Chicago Tribune .
The prestigious award helps push the most promising inventions into the market .
Other winners include specialized microscopes and super - hydrophobic coatings .
EMCORE is the proud producer of inverted metamorphic ( IMM ) solar cells , which are already used on land and in space .
The IMM technology recently made an in - orbit efficiency record of 33 % .
EMCORE is a reputable and successful semiconductor company .
Their solar technology has been on my radar for a while now .
Developed in conjunction with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory ( NREL ) and the Vehicle Systems Directorate of the US Air Force Research Laboratory ( AFRL ) , the IMM design is comprised of a novel combination of compound semiconductors that enables a superior response to the solar spectrum as compared to conventional multi-junction architecture .
Due to its unique design , the IMM cell is approximately one fifteenth the thickness of the conventional multi-junction solar cell and will enable a new class of extremely lightweight , high - efficiency , and flexible solar arrays for space applications .
( via news release )
These cells , and their soon - to - be second generation , are good for more than satellites in space .
When used with EMCORE ’s concentrated photovoltaic systems , they might just push for efficiencies as high as 45 % .
So what ’s the big deal ?
For years silicon panels have held the record in solar cell efficiency .
These multi-junction solar panels are right behind them but cost less .
They ’re also much lighter and thinner , which reduces transportation and installation costs .
The terrestrial market for cheap , high efficiency solar systems , especially systems that can scale up for utilities , is already booming around the globe .
EMCORE has been developing affordable , scalable CPV systems since 2004 , with their first commercial installation in May of 2008 .
With years of trial and error already behind them , they ’re positioned to become one of the major players in CPV within the next few years .
Pairing that technology with their award - winning solar cells could give them an edge in a young but growing solar industry .
Though CPV promises to produce a lot of energy while avoiding notoriously expensive materials , there ’s always a catch .
CPV works best when pointed directly at the sun , so expensive tracking mechanisms are used to shift the entire solar array throughout the day .
There ’s also the small matter of heat , which can melt some solar cells if you ’re not careful .
Nevertheless , EMCORE seems confident that they have overcome these obstacles to bring an economically lucrative product to market .
Their second generation IMM solar cells , promising even higher efficiency , are slated to hit the market by 2010 .
In the meantime , the first generation is already giving silicon cells a run for their money .

Latest Cleantech Talk Episode
“ IT IS just simply wrong for Congress to take a five - week paid vacation when so many families …are struggling under the weight of $ 4 - a - gallon gasoline . ”
With those words Mike Pence , a Republican congressman from Indiana , explained to a crowd of bewildered tourists , including a troop of Boy Scouts , why he was refusing to leave the floor of the House of Representatives when its summer break began on August 1st , even though the lights , microphones and television cameras had been switched off .
Instead , he and a few dozen Republican colleagues have returned to the chamber repeatedly in recent days to demand that Congress reconvene and vote on a proposal to increase the scope for oil - drilling in America 's territorial waters .
The Democrats have dismissed the “ Phantom Session ” as a gimmick .
Nancy Pelosi , the speaker of the House , calls it “ the war - dance of the handmaidens of the oil companies ” .
Even the White House has said there is no point recalling Congress , since the Democrats would continue to squelch the Republican initiative .
But the call for more drilling has captured the attention of the media and energised the Republicans , who have been searching for an issue to revive their foundering electoral prospects .
Mr Pence , one blogger quipped , could not normally secure a prime - time interview on CNN “ unless he hit Lindsay Lohan with a car ” .
Now drilling is dominating the airwaves , and the Democrats are on the defensive .
John McCain , the presumptive Republican presidential nominee and a supporter of offshore drilling , has ridiculed Barack Obama , his Democratic rival , for suggesting that Americans should try to conserve fuel by keeping their tyres fully inflated .
Republican activists have taken to handing out pressure gauges labelled “ Obama 's energy plan ” at rallies .
In response , Mr Obama has softened his opposition to offshore drilling , while denouncing Mr McCain as a lapdog of the oil industry who will do little to bring down prices .
Voters are certainly up in arms about the cost of oil .
They rate the health of the economy as the biggest problem facing the country and the rising price of energy as the biggest drag on the economy , according to a poll that was conducted last month by the Pew Research Centre , a think - tank .
Some 68 % of respondents said that petrol ( gasoline ) was hard to afford .
Among voters ' worries , the cost of driving easily eclipsed the war in Iraq , unemployment , health care or terrorism .
The Republicans argue that allowing oil firms more leeway to drill offshore will help to bring the price of petrol down .
Twelve years after an infamous spill from a well off Santa Barbara in 1969 , Congress barred the government from issuing new offshore leases anywhere but in the western Gulf of Mexico and Alaska .
By the government 's own reckoning , there are some 18 billion barrels of oil to be discovered in the restricted areas — enough to supply all America 's needs for two - and - a - half years .
Oilmen also have their eyes on the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge , which lies just beside prolific fields on Alaska 's North Slope , but there is less enthusiasm among Republicans for opening it to drilling ;
Mr McCain , for one , opposes the idea .
Moreover , there have been no big spills from offshore wells and platforms since 1969 ( oil tankers , such as the Exxon Valdez , are another matter ) .
Until recently , states whose beaches attract lots of tourists have supported the drilling ban .
Florida , for example , has traditionally resisted oil exploration in the eastern Gulf of Mexico , for fear of another devastating spill .
But congressmen hoping to lift the ban have tried to get round the objections of particular states by allowing them the final say on drilling close to shore , and by giving them a share of the royalties .
A recent poll by Quinnipiac University found that 60 % of Floridians now favour an expansion of drilling .
Democrats have tried to depict themselves not as enemies of drilling , but as the scourge of big oil firms .
They dismiss the offshore ban as a distraction , since it would take a decade or so to get any oil out of the seabed and into cars ( although that could be seen as a reason to hurry ) .
They also argue , rightly , that the volumes of oil involved would probably be too small , and too expensive to extract , to make much difference to the price .
But the alternatives the Democrats are attempting to push through Congress are an incoherent mish - mash .
One , dubbed “ use - it - or - lose - it ” , would oblige oil firms to exploit their existing leases more quickly or see them revert to the government .
The hitch is that federal leases already work along those lines , and few imagine that oil firms are deliberately ignoring vast pools of oil , given the current high price .
Another proposal involves revoking a tax break for oil firms , with the proceeds going to fund research into alternative energy .
Mr Obama , in a similar vein , wants to impose a “ windfall tax ” on oil firms ' profits and use the proceeds to give all taxpayers a $ 1,000 “ energy rebate ” .
But any measure that reduces oil firms ' margins in America is likely to have the effect of diverting at least some investment to other countries — and so exacerbate the shortage of fuel produced at home .
Other proposals target speculators and the OPEC cartel .
Yet another idea , to release some oil from America 's Strategic Petroleum Reserve , would doubtless help to bring prices down briefly .
But it would not be sustainable : the government 's entire stockpile would keep America going for no more than a few weeks , and is supposed to be used only in dire emergencies .
Democrats in either the House or the Senate have approved all these measures in some form , but the two chambers have been unable to agree on any of them .
The Republicans ' plans are little more coherent .
Mr McCain wants to suspend the federal government 's relatively paltry tax on petrol during the summer months , when Americans tend to drive more .
That would encourage drivers to buy more , pushing up prices again while reducing Uncle Sam 's take .
And both candidates want to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases — a sensible goal , but one that is likely to make energy more expensive , not cheaper .
Just before Congress shut up shop , a bipartisan group of ten senators suggested a compromise that would allow drilling off Florida , Georgia , the Carolinas and Virginia , while also raising taxes on oil firms .
But amid the charged pre-election atmosphere , it is hard to see it becoming law .
The Republicans are determined to make hay out of the Democrats ' perceived intransigence on drilling , while the Democrats are keen to paint the Republicans as the lackeys of greedy oil barons .
Meanwhile petrol has been getting cheaper of late , thanks to the sliding price of oil .
It still costs over $ 3.80 a gallon on average , $ 1 more than a year ago .
But it is some 25 cents below its peak , and falling .
Some Republican lawmakers , ludicrously , claim that the drop is a result of their drive for more drilling .
Mere talk of opening up America 's coastal waters , the theory runs , has convinced traders of a big future boost to oil supplies and so pushed the price down .
In fact , the gyrations on the oil market illustrate the opposite : they show that the price of oil is largely out of America 's politicians ' hands .

On 08 - Jul - 08 , a massive security patch was released by dozens of vendors for a major vulnerability in DNS ( Domain Name Service ) , discovered by security researcher Dan Kaminsky .
DNS is one of the fundamental underpinnings of the Internet , translating domain names ( like tidbits.com ) into IP addresses ( like 216.168.61.78 ) .
Because DNS is so core to the functioning of the Internet , this vulnerability is perhaps the most significant security problem to face the Internet in the last decade .
All users who connect to Mac OS X - based servers for DNS lookups are at risk :
Apple has not yet provided a patch , unlike dozens of other companies that make or distribute operating systems or DNS server software .
Apple was clearly distracted by the largest set of launches in its history : the iPhone 3G , the iPhone 2.0 software , the .
Mac - to - MobileMe transition , and the App Store .
Nonetheless , their customers are now in danger and Apple needs to respond immediately .
All companies that provide DNS service to their customers should have already updated their DNS servers .
Many have not .
You can determine whether your ISP is at risk by visiting Kaminsky ’s site and clicking the Check My DNS button .
If the site says your DNS is at risk of being poisoned , contact your ISP or your company ’s IT department immediately .
Poisoning the DNS Well — Kaminsky accidentally discovered a new technique attackers could use to compromise DNS servers , allowing ne ’er - do - wells to convince servers to accept an incorrect IP address for a given domain name from a source other than the one that properly controls information for that particular domain .
( This is called cache poisoning . )
The attack does n’t affect the DNS server software – it does n’t compromise the software itself – but rather the attack changes the information the server stores , or caches , to provide answers about domain names that the server has retrieved from elsewhere .
Thus , when you type www.tidbits.com into a Web browser ’s URL field , rather than your computer receiving back the correct IP address from its built - in DNS resolver – 216.168.61.78 , in this case – an attacker would indirectly convince that resolver to believe the address was something else , like 172.31.0.16 .
Your browser would obligingly use that IP address to make a connection to a Web server while displaying www.tidbits.com in the address bar .
That site could be – certainly would be – loaded with malware .
This is a particular problem for Windows users , whose systems could be infected simply by visiting a site .
With no active exploits for Mac OS X that currently result from visiting a Web page , Mac users are more likely to fall victim to social engineering after visiting a site and being told to re-enter a password or provide details that a trusted site does n’t normally ask for .
DNS is distributed and can be recursive , meaning a server keeps working through a set of linked responses it gets from other DNS servers until it gets an authoritative answer .
Your computer has a “ stub ” resolver , which knows to ask a full - blown DNS server for the name - to - number conversion .
The full - blown DNS server is typically run by your ISP or the company you work for .
That DNS server , in turn , asks root nameservers – run by a variety of organizations – where to find details about , say , .com .
The root nameservers direct your ISP or company ’s DNS server to the server that has the lookups for that domain .
This can go on and on for every dot - separated part in a domain name , but it typically follows this path : root server , top - level ( such as .com ) domain server , and corporate domain server .
Weakening SSL / TLS , But Not Killing
It —
This attack does not directly disable secure Web connections , although it weakens the signals you rely on for trust , and requires that you be more alert .
Secure Web connections use SSL / TLS ( Secure Sockets Layer / Transport Layer Security ) , a mechanism that encrypts a connection and also relies on trust outside that connection to validate the connection .
The digital certificates used as the basis of these connections require that a domain name match a particular IP address ; but if your DNS has been poisoned , a bogus certificate becomes a much more serious risk .
However , the outside trust element should save you .
Certificates must be signed by third parties , known as certificate authorities , like Thawte or Comodo .
These authorities are supposed to verify the identity of a party requesting a certificate before the authority signs their request .
Authorities charge fees from tens to thousands of dollars depending on how much background checking and control over the certificate is asked for .
Details about these authorities are pre-installed in browsers and operating systems completing the circle of trust :
Your browser knows an authority ’s signature , which enables your system to validate the authority ’s approval of a Web ’s site certificate .
If an attacker ’s fake site tries to present you with a certificate that alleges it ’s www.amazon.com, your browser will alert you that the certificate has n’t been signed or at least was n’t signed by a known certificate authority .
That ’s always a reason to refuse a connection , unless you ’re connecting to a Web site run by a trusted party that ’s given you explicit information about the certificate they ’ve chosen to use .
A Coordinated Fix , Except for Apple —
While cache poisoning has always been a problem for DNS , the technique Kaminsky discovered is faster and more effective than any previous known exploits .
Kaminsky ’s flaw allows an attacker to overwrite existing DNS entries that a server has already cached – something never before possible .
This vulnerability is a flaw with the protocol itself , and thus affects nearly every DNS implementation in use .
After determining this flaw was legitimate and widespread , Kaminsky immediately contacted major vendors – operating system makers and DNS software developers – and other DNS experts who met secretly at a meeting hosted on the Microsoft campus in March 2008 .
In an unprecedented move , the vendors all agreed on a simultaneous release of fixes for their products , coordinated with the help of the United States Computer Emergency Response Team ( US - CERT ) .
To obfuscate the nature of the vulnerability , the companies all agreed to use a fix – port randomization – that did n’t necessarily reveal the details of the flaw , thus slowing down the ability of bad guys to reverse engineer it and attack servers before organizations could patch .
This lasted for 13 days , until the vulnerability was disclosed by a security researcher who accidentally published a draft blog post with all the details .
By 24 - Jul - 08 exploit modules appeared in the popular Metasploit penetration testing tool , empowering any attacker capable of downloading the tool and using a web browser .
( The brief explanation of the flaw is that by forcing a DNS server to look up certain domains by sending it requests , an attacker can take advantage of a predictable sequence of port numbers to send a massive number of fake answers to the DNS server .
If just one of the fake answers gets through , the attacker “ wins ” ; it ’s essentially a race in which the bad guy can have a million marathon runners and the good guy thinks they ’re off for a solo jog in the park .
This can be accomplished in a couple of minutes with Metasploit .
Randomizing the sequence of ports used in requests vastly increases the complexity of a bad guy winning .
The general vulnerability of predictably used ports was understood in 2001 and built into the DNS server djbdns .
The real answer to this problem is DNSSEC , which combines public - key cryptography with DNS , allowing only the legitimate domain owner to provide answers to DNS queries about its domain .
DNSSEC has been bogged down for years , but a logjam broke in March 2008 , and we ’re likely to see real use due to this basic DNS flaw being revealed . )
Apple Punts , Does n’t Patch Yet —
Apple has yet to patch this vulnerability , which affects both the desktop version of Mac OS X and Mac OS X Server .
While individual computers that look up DNS are vulnerable , servers are far more at risk due to the nature and scope of the attack .
Apple uses the popular Internet Systems Consortium BIND DNS server which was one of the first tools patched , but Apple has yet to include the fixed version in Mac OS X Server , despite being notified of vulnerability details early in the process and being informed of the coordinated patch release date .
All users of Mac OS X Server who use it for recursive DNS must immediately switch to an alternative or risk being compromised and traffic being redirected .
Installing the above - mentioned BIND should be relatively trivial for anyone who can compile software at the command line .
The Mac community could take this up if someone created a compiled version of BIND 9.0.5 - P1 and distributed it for simpler installation .
With active exploit code available in a common attack tool , it is imperative that Apple fix this vulnerability .
Due to their involvement in the process and the ability of other vendors to fix their products in a timely fashion , it ’s hard to imagine any possible justification for Apple ’s tardy behavior .
If you are unable to patch a server system with new code , you could reconfigure those servers to forward DNS requests to alternative platforms , such as BIND on Linux or Unix , or Microsoft servers , until Apple issues a patch .
Ask your ISP or network provider for assistance .
Although the desktop version of Mac OS X is also technically vulnerable , current attacks are directed at servers , so there ’s no need to panic .
This is an extremely serious security issue and we hope Apple will act responsibly and address it immediately , despite their initial tardiness .

Big state budget shortfalls are an inevitable side effect of a weak economy .
The Wall Street Journal reports that the decline is projected to leave states with an aggregate deficit three times the level last year , and suggest that the economy may be weaker than the GDP stats suggest .
FYI , I was just on a panel at the Inman Real Estate Conference in San Francisco with ( among others ) John Williams of ShadowStats , CR of Calculated Risk , and Noah Rosenblatt of UrbanDiggs .
Williams claims that were government figures prepared on the same basis as they were in 1970 , we ’d already be in the worst recession since the Great Depression .
I ’m not sure I ’d go that far , but I am willing to accept the notion that we are in a recession , as opposed to skirting on the brink of one .
From the Wall Street Journal :
The stumbling U.S. economy is forcing states to slash spending and cut jobs in order to close a projected $ 40 billion shortfall in the current fiscal year .
That gap — identified Wednesday in a survey by the National Conference of State Legislatures — is more than triple the size of the previous year ’s .
It is the result of broad economic weakness at the state and local levels that could cause pain throughout this year and into 2010 .
Sales - tax collections , for example , have been hurt by the housing slump and high gasoline prices , which are prompting cutbacks in consumer spending .
Personal income - tax collections have been hit by rising unemployment , while corporate income - tax collections have been eroded by falling profits … .
A separate survey of economic conditions by the Federal Reserve ’s 12 regional banks — the “ beige book ” — said economic activity was sluggish across most of the U.S… .
Unlike the federal government , most states are required to balance their budgets .
Most have so far resisted tax increases , instead opting for raising prices on things like tolls and college tuition , and cutting back on services like education and health care .
Some chose one - time measures such as tapping rainy - day funds that were built up in flusher times .
That could lead to future cutbacks if the economy does n’t bounce back in coming months .
The spreading economic weakness also is affecting localities , which are being ravaged by falling property - tax collections and a decline in state aid .
In Minnesota , the city of Duluth plans to stop operating its Fun Wagon — a free trailer stuffed with games and cookout supplies for a neighborhood party .
Other services , including a city pool and a fire hall , also are being eliminated ….
The housing slump , now well into its second year , is the primary culprit .
The decline in home sales has cut into real - estate transfer taxes .
Construction spending and employment has declined .
Fewer home sales have resulted in lower sales of home furnishings and washing machines , eating into sales taxes .
Of course , for many states , today ’s budget woes stem at least partly from expanding their services during the good times and not planning enough for the inevitable downturn .
Meantime , states are dealing with shortfalls of many kinds .
According to the report by the association of state legislatures , 22 states are reporting sales taxes that are below forecast .
In nine of those states , the collections were below forecasts that had already been reduced downward .
Seventeen states had a shortfall in corporate income tax , 11 states were behind on personal - income taxes , and 11 were also behind on miscellaneous taxes such as insurance - premium taxes .
Bush in 2000 : I 'll bring down gas prices through ' sheer force of personality '

The 2000 Campaign : The Texas Governor ; Bush Would Use Power of Persuasion to Raise Oil Supply
The New York Times
By Katharine Q. Seeyle
28 June 2000 Gov. George W. Bush of Texas said today that if he was president , he would bring down gasoline prices through sheer force of personality , by creating enough political good will with oil - producing nations that they would increase their supply of crude .
'' I would work with our friends in OPEC to convince them to open up the spigot , to increase the supply , '' Mr. Bush , the presumptive Republican candidate for president , told reporters here today .
'' Use the capital that my administration will earn , with the Kuwaitis or the Saudis , and convince them to open up the spigot . ''
Implicit in his comments was a criticism of the Clinton administration as failing to take advantage of the good will that the United States built with Kuwait and Saudi Arabia during the Persian Gulf war in 1991 .
Also implicit was that as the son of the president who built the coalition that drove the Iraqis out of Kuwait , Mr. Bush would be able to establish ties on a personal level that would persuade oil - producing nations that they owed the United States something in return .
'' Ours is a nation that helped Kuwait and the Saudis , and you 'd think we'd have the capital necessary to convince them to increase the crude supplies , '' he said .
Asked why the Clinton administration had not been able to use the power of personal persuasion , Mr. Bush said : '' The fundamental question is , ' Will I be a successful president when it comes to foreign policy ? ' ''
He went on to suggest , as he did in answer to other questions , that voters should simply trust him .
'' I will be , '' he said in answer to his own question about whether he would be a successful president .
'' But until I 'm the president , it 's going to be hard for me to verify that I think I 'll be more effective .'' < snip > ***** Saudi Arabia rebuffs Bush on oil production -- White House : Riyadh says it 's already meeting customers ' demands
The Associated Press
Updated 1:53 p.m. ET , Fri. , May. 16 , 2008 RIYADH , Saudi Arabia - Saudi Arabias leaders made clear Friday they see no reason to increase oil production until customers demand it , apparently rebuffing President [ sic ]
Bush amid soaring U.S. gasoline prices .
It was Bushs second personal appeal this year to King Abdullah , head of the monarchy that rules this desert kingdom that is a longtime prime U.S. ally and home to the worlds largest oil reserves .
But Saudi officials stuck to their position that they will only pump more oil into the system when asked to by buyers , something they say is not happening now , the presidents national security adviser told reporters .
 Saudi Arabia does not have customers that are making requests for oil that they are not able to satisfy ,  Stephen Hadley said on a day when oil prices topped $ 127 a barrel , continuing to set records .
 What the Saudis wanted to tell us was were doing everything we can do ... to meet this problem , but its a complicated problem ... "
Minister thinks Bush ' was satisfied '
... Hadley suggested the White House was satisfied with -- or at least accepted -- the Saudi response .
He added , however , the Bush administration will see if the explanation conforms to what our experts say . 
Saudi Foreign Minister Saud al - Faisal said the discussion with Bush about oil was friendly .
 He didnt punch any tables or shout at anybody ,  the minister said .
 I think he was satisfied . ...
When Bush and Abdullah met in the kingdom in mid-January , the president also sought more Saudi output in a plea that also ultimately was for naught .

Saudi oil output hike would not solve US problems : Bush
17 May 2008 SHARM EL - SHEIKH , Egypt ( AFP ) -- US President [ sic ] George W. Bush said on Saturday that a hike in oil output by Saudi Arabia would not solve American energy problems .
" It 's not enough , it 's something but it does n't solve our problem , " Bush told reporters in Egypt 's Red Sea resort of Sharm el - Sheikh .
" Our problem in America gets solved when we aggressively go for domestic exploration .
Our problem in America gets solved if we expand our refining capacity , promote nuclear energy and continue our strategy for the advancing of alternative energies as well as conservation , " he said .

Todd Bertuzzi has filed court papers claiming that the negligence of former Vancouver Canucks head coach Marc Crawford contributed to Bertuzzi 's infamous sucker punch of Steve Moore in March 2004 , according to documents obtained by CBC News .
" We are not prepared to comment , except to say Todd Bertuzzi has claimed that Marc Crawford has to share in the responsibility for any damages awarded to Steve Moore , " Geoffrey Adair , who is Bertuzzi 's lawyer , told CBC News on Friday .
Bertuzzi was an all - star forward for the Canucks when he hit Moore from behind 8:41 into the third period of a 9 - 2 loss to the Colorado Avalanche on March 8 , 2004 in Vancouver .
The punch came after an earlier game in which Moore knocked Vancouver captain Markus Naslund unconscious with an open-ice hit to the head .
Moore was n't penalized on the play .
Bertuzzi's punch left Moore with three broken vertebrae in his neck and a concussion .
Moore has n't played since , and is suing Bertuzzi — now with the Anaheim Ducks — for upward of $ 38 million .
Crawford — now the head coach of the Los Angeles Kings — was not named as a defendant in the suit .
The third - party claim filed in Ontario Superior Court by Bertuzzi 's lawyers alleges that Crawford should be named in the suit because he allegedly urged his players in March 2004 , including Bertuzzi , to make Moore " pay the price " when Crawford " knew or ought to have known that this was likely to result in injury to Moore . "
The papers also allege that Crawford " failed to exercise control over and caution his players against physical aggression toward Moore . "
The NHL suspended Bertuzzi indefinitely for attacking Moore , and did n't reinstate him until Aug. 8 , 2005 — exactly 17 months later .
Bertuzzi remained under suspension throughout the 310 - day NHL lockout and was prohibited from competing in the 2004 World Cup of Hockey , two world championships and in European pro leagues .
He also forfeited $ 501,926.39 US in salary and hundreds of thousands more in endorsements .
Criminal charges filed against Bertuzzi in Vancouver resulted in a guilty plea and a sentence of one year 's probation plus 80 hours of community service .
Moore later filed a lawsuit in Denver against Bertuzzi and other notables , including Canucks ownership , but it was dismissed .
With Bertuzzi in Turin , Italy , playing for Team Canada at the Winter Olympics , Moore filed a second lawsuit on Feb. 15 , 2006 .
At the time , he was seeking $ 18 million for lost income , aggravated and punitive damages , but is now demanding $ 38 million in an amended claim .
( CNN ) --
An estimated 95 percent of Louisiana 's 2 million coastal residents had fled ahead of Hurricane Gustav by Sunday evening in the largest evacuation in state history , Louisiana 's governor said .
The streets of the French Quarter in New Orleans clear out as residents evacuate in anticipation of Hurricane Gustav . more photos »
More than 200,000 people have left New Orleans , leaving an estimated 10,000 people in the city Sunday night , Gov. Bobby Jindal said , citing New Orleans ' police chief .
New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin had demanded an evacuation of the city , which still is recovering from 2005 's Hurricane Katrina .
Forecasters warned Gustav -- a Category 3 storm Sunday night -- could hit Louisiana with devastating effect late Monday morning or early Monday afternoon .
Jindal said New Orleans ' levees should " barely hold or barely be overtopped " if the storm , as predicted Sunday evening , hit southwest of the city .
But even a slight shift to the east could bring " very significant flooding in these areas , " he said .

On Sunday night , road , rail and air links out of New Orleans began to close ahead of Gustav , which was sweeping toward the Gulf Coast with 115 - mph winds .
At 8 p.m. ET , Gustav was about 260 miles south - southeast of New Orleans , the National Hurricane Center in Miami , Florida , reported .
The storm was moving across the central Gulf of Mexico at 17 mph .
Hurricane - force winds could hit Louisiana 's southern coast by sunrise Monday , and the storm 's center could hit southwest of New Orleans by early Monday afternoon , CNN meteorologists said .
Watch residents leaving »
Dangerous storm surges of 10 to 14 feet above normal tides are expected near and to the east of Gustav 's center , forecasters said .
Rain accumulations between 6 to 12 inches are possible over parts of Louisiana , Mississippi and Arkansas , with isolated amounts of up to 20 inches , through Wednesday morning , according to forecasters .
Gustav killed at least 51 people in southwestern Haiti and eight in the neighboring Dominican Republic last week before moving to Cuba .
It was in the Caribbean on Friday and intensified just before it hit Cuba .
In New Orleans , Lt. Col. Jerry Sneed , the city 's emergency operations chief , said government agencies had evacuated 18,000 residents who were without transportation .
National Guard troops and police were still combing the city late Sunday afternoon , broadcasting evacuation messages in English , Vietnamese and Spanish , Jindal said .
Jindal said the New Orleans area had finished evacuating homebound and nursing home patients by 7 p.m. ET Sunday , and 73 critical - care patients deemed OK to move still were in the process of being moved out of the area .
Some critical - care patients had to stay at medical facilities .
Eighty patients remained Sunday evening at New Orleans Children 's Hospital , more than half of them in a critical care unit .
Nurse Crystal Mayeaux says she will not leave them .
" We are attached to all the babies here , she says .
" They know us .
" The last flights out of the city 's airport were slated to take off Sunday evening , and highways out of town were packed all day with evacuees from Louisiana and Mississippi .
" It was bumper - to - bumper for about 10 hours trying to get out , " said Roberto Ascencio , a restaurant owner in the New Orleans suburb of Gretna .
He said he , his wife and daughter packed their pets and whatever else would fit in their car and headed east on Interstate 10 as Gustav neared .
Nagin said New Orleans would impose a " dusk - to - dawn " curfew for anyone left .
Watch Nagin voice concern about storm 's potential effect on the city »
The city - wide curfew will continue until the threat of the storm passes , Nagin said , warning looters would be dealt with harshly .
Watch Nagin warn would - be looters »
" Anybody who 's caught looting in the city of New Orleans will go directly to Angola [ Louisiana State Penitentiary ] .
You will not have a temporary stay in the city .
You go directly to the big house , in general population , " he said .
The storm altered plans for the Republican National Convention , which is scheduled to run from Monday through Thursday in St. Paul , Minnesota .
Rick Davis , campaign manager for presumptive GOP presidential nominee John McCain , said Monday 's session would run only from 3 to 5:30 p.m. CT , and will include only activities that are necessary to launch the event .
" Owing to the fact that [ McCain ] has asked us to take our Republican hats off and put our American hats on , tomorrow 's program will be business only , and we 'll refrain from any political rhetoric that would be traditional in an opening session of a convention , " Davis said .
Convention plans for the rest of the week will be made as the storm is assessed , he said .
Earlier Sunday , President Bush said he would forgo an appearance at the convention on Monday to go to Texas to meet with emergency workers and evacuees .
He urged Gulf Coast residents to get out of the storm 's path .
" This storm is dangerous , " Bush warned after a briefing at FEMA headquarters , urging residents to heed calls to evacuate .
Also Sunday , a federally supported computer projection says Gustav could cause up to $ 29.3 billion in property damage when it hits the Gulf Coast .
The software , developed by FEMA and the National Institute of Building Sciences , also projected Sunday that 4.5 million people will be in the storm 's path and 59,953 buildings will be destroyed .
The path also ensnares about 170 hospitals and more than 1,100 police and fire stations .
State , local and federal officials urged residents across the region to flee .
Charter flights , paid for with federal funds , carried thousands of evacuees to other Southern cities , including Knoxville , Nashville and Memphis in Tennessee .
The air evacuation was part of a detailed plan developed in response to criticism after Katrina 's chaos .
Katrina , a Category 3 storm , flooded most of New Orleans , flattened beach towns in Mississippi and killed more than 1,800 people .
Maps of Gustav 's path show that it could strike southern Louisiana and other areas battered by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005 .
Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour said government agencies were " 10 times better prepared " than before -- but " that does n't mean everything is going to go right , " he said .
" Anybody who thinks everything is going to go perfect just does n't know what they 're talking about , " Barbour said .

Godamn this is a good blog .
Godamn I am subscribing to it .
( Godamn ) I consistently come away in awe of how eloquently you write , and how you make choosing exactly the right word seem so effortless .
You also seem to find subject matter in a wide variety of places , and you link contemporary and long - past events in unexpected ways .
I found your blog about a month ago via your comments on Pharyngula and have fallen completely in love with your writing .
Every entry is a pleasure to read .
Love your blog by the way .

The Pentagon 's non-lethal weapons division is looking for technologies that could " disable " aircraft , before they can take off from a runway – or block the planes from flying over a given city of stretch of land .
In a request for proposals , issued earlier this week , the Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Directorate announced that it would like arms - makers to come up with a way to " safely divert an aircraft in the air or stop and / or disable an aircraft on the ground . "
And no , shooting the thing with a missile does n't count .
The Directorate wants " reversible effects which allow the targeted aircraft to be quickly returned to an operational condition with minimal time to repair . "
* The primary focus of the “ divert an aircraft ”
task is to control the airspace and enforce no - fly or restricted flight zones .
Effects should be focused on the aircraft , not the pilot or other personnel on board .
The capability should enable the enforcement of flight restriction zones ( e.g. , metropolitan Washington , D.C. ) , protection of critical infrastructure and other high value assets from a possible aerial threat .
* * For aircraft on the ground , “ stop ” requires the aircraft to come to 0 mph at some point between when it starts to taxi and when it reaches abort speed .
The requirement to “ disable ” includes actions to render inoperable , deny use , and / or deny access to an aircraft on the ground .
Successful accomplishment of either objective results in keeping the targeted aircraft from becoming airborne . *
The
Directorate 's program managers do n't mention how engineers might pull off such a kill switch .
But , however it 's done , they 'd like to have a similar system for boats , as well .
They 're looking for a device that can , from 100 meters away , " safely stop or significantly impede the movement " of vessels up to 40 feet long , with " minimal collateral damage . "
The Directorate is also looking for new ways to stop people .
One proposed project involves studying " thermal laser effects for non-lethal application . "
Research , the Directorate notes , should
" focus on understanding reversible health effects , pulsing methods , and effectiveness through clothing . "
Aug. 20 , 2008 -- Motherhood sure has changed in the past 30 years .
Today , U.S. women are having fewer babies , and more women are choosing to be childless .
A new report looking at state - by - state information from the U.S. Census Bureau paints a changing landscape of motherhood today when compared to the 1970s .
Consider this : 20 % of women today aged 40 to 44 have no children .
That percentage is double what it was 30 years ago .
The data are from the Census Bureau 's 2006 American Community Survey and the Current Population Survey .
The surveys aimed to discover how many children are being born , to whom , and what the fertility rates are around the country .
Women aged 15 to 50 were surveyed about fertility between 2005 and 2006

In a story straight out of Cory Doctorow 's Little Brother , three MIT undergraduates concocted a scheme to hack Boston 's transit payment system , the Charlie Card ( no relation ) .
The students managed to reprogram the cards to increase their credit balance , thus allowing them to ride the subway for free .
Of course , being MIT students , they decided to write up their prank as an academic paper .
But the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority ( MBTA ) , already stinging from such a thorough pwning , took it to the courts , citing computer fraud , and asking for time to fix the system before the paper was presented .
It is also thought that an MBTA official was overheard saying " It 's not fair .
I 'm telling my mom . "
MBTA lost .
Judge George O'Toole ruled that " presenting an academic paper would not violate computer fraud laws . "
Go hackers .
The students , Zack Anderson , R.J. Ryan and Alessandro Chiesa , went on to receive " top marks " for their paper , from which we can conclude the following : RFID is very insecure , and MIT is awesome .

One of the benefits of being around a long time is that you get to know a lot about certain things .
I 'm 80 years old and I 've been an oilman for almost 60 years .
I 've drilled more dry holes and also found more oil than just about anyone in the industry .
With all my experience , I 've never been as worried about our energy security as I am now .
Like many of us , I ignored what was happening .
Now our country faces what I believe is the most serious situation since World War II .
The problem , of course , is our growing dependence ...
How we achieve happiness can be different for each one of us .
Our passions , expectations , life experiences , and even our personalities all contribute to the level of happiness we experience in our lives .
Some find happiness in their careers while others prefer the bliss found in their marriages or other intimate relationship .
No matter how you define happiness for yourself , there are certain universal and time - proven strategies to bring , and sustain , more happiness into your life .
The following 14 ways to live a happy life can be adapted and even customized to fit your needs .
Over time , these strategies will become positive and life - changing habits that will begin to bring more happiness , joy and peace into your life .
1. Notice What ’s Right
Some of us see the glass as being half - full , while others see the glass as half - empty .
The next time you are caught in traffic , begin thinking how nice it is to have a few moments to reflect on the day , focus on a problem you have been trying to solve , or brainstorm on your next big idea .
The next time you get in the slow line at the grocery store , take the opportunity to pick up a tabloid magazine and do some “ guilty pleasure ” reading .
Take all that life throws out you and reframe it with what ’s right about the situation .
At the end of the day , you will more content , at peace and happy .
Take the time to begin to notice what ’s right and see the world change in front of your eyes .
2. Be Grateful
How many times do you say the words “ thank you , ” in a day ?
How many times do you hear these same words ?
If you are doing the first thing , saying the “ thank yous , ” the latter will naturally happen .
Learn to be grateful and you will be open to receive an abundance of joy and happiness .
3. Remember the Kid You Were
Do you remember how to play ?
I ’m not referring to playing a round of golf or a set of tennis .
I ’m talking about playing like you did when you were a child – a game of tag ; leap frog , or street baseball when the bat is a broken broom handle and the bases are the parked cars .
One way to find or maintain your happiness is to remember the kid you were and play !
4. Be Kind
There is no question that by merely watching acts of kindness creates a significant elevation in our moods and increases the desire for us to perform good deeds as well .
Kindness is indeed contagious and when we make a commitment to be kind to ourselves and to others we can experience new heights of joy , happiness and enthusiasm for our lives .
5. Spend Time with Your Friends
Although an abundant social and romantic life does not itself guarantee joy , it does have a huge impact on our happiness .
Learn to spend time with your friends and make the friendships a priority in your life .
6. Savor Every Moment
To be in the moment is to live in the moment .
Too often we are thinking ahead or looking ahead to the next event or circumstance in our lives , not appreciating the “ here and now . ”
When we savor every moment , we are savoring the happiness in our lives .
7. Rest
There are times when we need the time to unwind , decompress , or to put it simply , just “ to chill . ”
Life comes at all of us hard and fast .
Time , as do the days on the calendar , keeps going forward at its own natural pace , which is not always the pace we would choose .
Fatigue , stress and exhaustion may begin to settle in on us faster than we may think , or notice .
The best remedy for this is indeed rest .
8. Move !
The expression a “ runner ’s high ” does not infer an addiction , but a feeling or a state of mind – a state of euphoria .
There is no question exercise , or any physical exertion , elevates your mood and enhances a more positive attitude as well as fosters better personal self - esteem and confidence .
Indeed , one way to increase your happiness is to move !
9 . Put on a Happy Face
Sometimes we have to fake it until we make it .
I ’m not suggesting that we not be honest , real or authentic , but I ’m suggesting , sometimes , we just need to put on a happy face and keep moving forward .
Researchers claim that smiling and looking like we are happy will indeed make us happier .
Studies further show that if we act like we are happy then we can experience greater joy and happiness in our lives .
10 . Pursue Your Goals
The absence of goals in our lives , or more specifically avoiding to pursue our goals , makes us feel like we are stuck and ineffective .
The pursuit of goals in our personal lives , in our relationships , or with our careers , is the difference between having a mediocre life or a life full of passion and enthusiasm .
pursue your goals and watch your happiness soar .
11 . Finding Your Calling
Some find meaning in religion or spirituality while others find purpose in their work or relationships .
Finding your calling may be much more than accomplishing one simple strategy for increasing your happiness , but having a sense of purpose – of feeling like you are here for a reason – can perhaps bring the greatest joy of all
12 . Get into the Flow
Flow is the form of joy , excitement and happiness that occurs when we are so absorbed in an activity we love that we can loose ourselves and time seems to stand still .
What creates flow is unique to each one of us .
To find and sustain true happiness in our lives , we must get off the sidelines and get into the flow .
13 . Play to Your Strengths
One way to achieve flow is by understanding and identifying our strengths and core values , and then begin to use these every day .
Once we aware of our strengths and we begin to play to your strengths we can better incorporate them in all aspects of our lives .
14 . Do n’t Overdo It
Know when to say when .
What gives you joy and happiness the first time may not work the second time .
Too much of a good thing may begin not to feel as good if the “ thing ” becomes more of a routine , or an expectation .
Set healthy and reasonable boundaries for yourself and do n’t overdo it .

MADONNA LOUISE CICCONE
PARENTS Silvio , a design engineer for General Motors , and Madonna Louise , a housewife ( died of cancer in 1963 ) .

INFLUENCES
BARBIE
She may be pink , but Barbie 's origins are a lot darker .
Her creator , Ruth Handler , the wife of Mattel Toys ' co-founder , modelled her on a German doll bought on a European holiday in 1956 .
The ' Bild Lilli ' toy , based on a newspaper cartoon strip , was a ' sultry , gold - digging prostitute ' .
Lilli was originally sold to adults , but she became popular with children , who enjoyed dressing her up .
Handler thought it important to a girl 's self - esteem that she play with an adult doll with breasts , distinguishing the toy from the baby dolls favoured by children until then - but not all parents approved of Barbie 's magnificent cleavage , which was remodelled several times .
MADONNA
In her early career , she borrowed influences from cinematic icons - the blonde bombshell look of Marilyn Monroe ( as in her Material Girl video ) , the gamine charm of Jean Seberg in the movie Breathless ( as in the video for Cherish ) and the glamour of Marlene Dietrich ( Vogue ) .
Musically , she lists The Carpenters and Nancy Sinatra as early influences .
Her greatest strength , however , is her knack of tapping into whatever trend is about to become mainstream before it reaches tipping point .
Let them eat cake : Madonna takes inspiration from another blonde diva , Marie - Antoinette
STYLE
BARBIE
Like Madonna , Barbie has more than a few designer pieces in her wardrobe , including outfits by Oscar de la Renta , Vera Wang and Yves Saint Laurent .
Early on in her career she was already on the reinvention path : in 1963 , Fashion Queen Barbie debuted with three wigs , and , by 1970 , way ahead of Madonna , along came a bendy , supple Barbie , complete with flexible elbows , knees and ankles and swivelling waist , arms , hands and legs .
And , like Madonna , Barbie has reinterpreted the style of Hollywood icons , including Vivien Leigh , Audrey Hepburn and Monroe .
By 1987 , Barbie 's concert tour outfits bore a striking similarity to Madonna's .
MADONNA
Madonna prides herself on being a true chameleon .
One minute she 's a peroxide blonde dominatrix , the next a geisha cowgirl or demure lady of the manor in twinset and pearls .
And designers love her for it .
Those who have created looks for her include Jean - Paul Gaultier ( conical bras ) , Dolce &Gabbana and Stella McCartney .
These days she veers between raunch for promotional purposes and her yummy mummy guise out in public .
M by Madonna , her clothes collection for H&M in 2007 , divided fashionistas : some called it dull , while others lauded it as classic .

CAREER
BARBIE
From McDonald 's cashier to US president , Barbie 's career has been even more colourful than Madonna's .
Yes , she 's been a rock star and a fashion designer , but she 's also succeeded as a doctor , dentist , nurse , surgeon and vet .
She 's been an army officer and an air force pilot , an astronaut and an air hostess .
She 's even qualified as a paleontologist .
More than a billion Barbie dolls have been sold worldwide in more than 150 countries , generating sales of more than £ 90 million .
But Barbie has her detractors : even in America , where there 's a protest group named the Barbie Liberation Organization that challenges gender - stereotyping in the toy industry , and in Montpelier , Vermont , she has been banned because she represents two of the worst evils - commercialism and sexism .
In 2003 , Barbie 's provocative clothing was found offensive to Islam in Saudi Arabia .
MADONNA
Singer , songwriter , record producer , actor , fashion designer and author , Madonna is the world 's top- earning female singer , having sold more than 200 million albums worldwide .
She sang the Oscar - winning You Must Love Me from the Evita soundtrack , has picked up seven Grammys and won a Best Actress Golden Globe for Evita .
This year , Madge surpassed Elvis as the artist with the most US top ten hits ever , and she has had more UK number one singles than any other female solo artist .
In 1989 , Pepsi , who had entered into a £ 2.5 million multi - year endorsement with her , pulled the plug when her video for Like A Prayer caused outrage .
She got to keep the cash .
Although there is a 13 ft - tall statue of Madonna in Pacentro , Italy , the town of her ancestors , the singer is something of a religious iconoclast and has clashed with the Pope , who has urged Italians to boycott her tours , as well as the Federation of Jewish Churches in Russia and rabbis in Israel .
FACT !
Madonna has graced the cover of Vanity Fair magazine more than any other person .
To date she has boasts ten covers to her name
THE FUTURE
BARBIE
She saw off Sindy in the 1970s and has reinvented herself more times than Madonna ever will , but , since 2001 , she has faced serious competition from the Bratz range of dolls : in 2004 Bratz overtook Barbie in the UK , and , by 2005 , sales of Barbie had dropped by 30 per cent in America and 20 per cent elsewhere .
Is Barbie about to face her swan song ?
MADONNA
Amid rumours that her marriage to Guy Ritchie is about to expire and she is moving back to the US , Madonna prepares not only for her 50th birthday but the Sticky & Sweet world tour to promote her latest disc , Hard Candy .
Boy everyone in this country is running around yammering about their fucking rights .
“ I have a right , you have no right , we have a right . ”
Folks I hate to spoil your fun , but … there ’s no such thing as rights .
They ’re imaginary .
We made ’em up .
Like the boogie man .
Like Three Little Pigs , Pinocio , Mother Goose , shit like that .
Rights are an idea .
They ’re just imaginary .
They ’re a cute idea .
Cute .
But that ’s all .
Cute …and fictional .
But if you think you do have rights , let me ask you this , “ where do they come from ? ”
People say , “ They come from God .
They ’re God given rights . ”
Awww fuck , here we go again … here we go again .
The God excuse , the last refuge of a man with no answers and no argument , “ It came from God . ”
Anything we ca n’t describe must have come from God .
Personally folks , I believe that if your rights came from God , he would ’ve given you the right for some food every day , and he would ’ve given you the right to a roof over your head .
GOD would ’ve been looking out for ya .
You know that .
He would n’t have been worried making sure you have a gun so you can get drunk on Sunday night and kill your girlfriend ’s parents .
But let ’s say it ’s true .
Let ’s say that God gave us these rights .
Why would he give us a certain number of rights ?
The Bill of Rights of this country has 10 stipulations .
OK … 10 rights .
And apparently God was doing sloppy work that week , because we ’ve had to ammend the bill of rights an additional 17 times .
So God forgot a couple of things , like …SLAVERY .
Just fuckin’ slipped his mind .
But let ’s say … let ’s say God gave us the original 10 .
He gave the british 13 .
The british Bill of Rights has 13 stipulations .
The Germans have 29 , the Belgians have 25 , the Sweedish have only 6 , and some people in the world have no rights at all .
What kind of a fuckin’ god damn god given deal is that !?… NO RIGHTS AT ALL !?
Why would God give different people in different countries a different numbers of different rights ?
Boredom ?
Amusement ?
Bad arithmetic ?
Do we find out at long last after all this time that God is weak in math skills ?
Does n’t sound like divine planning to me .
Sounds more like human planning .
Sounds more like one group trying to control another group .
In other words … business as usual in America .
Now , if you think you do have rights , I have one last assignment for ya .
Next time you ’re at the computer get on the Internet , go to Wikipedia .
When you get to Wikipedia , in the search field for Wikipedia , i want to type in , “ Japanese - Americans 1942 ” and you ’ll find out all about your precious fucking rights .
Alright .
You know about it .
In 1942 there were 110,000 Japanese - American citizens , in good standing , law abiding people , who were thrown into internment camps simply because their parents were born in the wrong country .
That ’s all they did wrong .
They had no right to a lawyer , no right to a fair trial , no right to a jury of their peers , no right to due process of any kind .
The only right they had was …right this way !
Into the internment camps .
Just when these American citizens needed their rights the most … their government took them away .
and rights are n’t rights if someone can take em away .
They ’re priveledges .
That ’s all we ’ve ever had in this country is a bill of TEMPORARY priviledges ; and if you read the news , even badly , you know the list get ’s shorter , and shorter , and shorter .
Yeup , sooner or later the people in this country are going to realize the government does n’t give a fuck about them .
the government does n’t care about you , or your children , or your rights , or your welfare or your safety .
it simply does n’t give a fuck about you .
It ’s interested in it ’s own power .
That ’s the only thing … keeping it , and expanding wherever possible .
Personally when it comes to rights , I think one of two things is true : either we have unlimited rights , or we have no rights at all .
He added : " In this instance we decided , after much deliberation , to postpone publication for the safety of the author , employees of Random House , booksellers and anyone else who would be involved in distribution and sale of the novel . "
' Elitist ' to many Americans , maybe half the voting population , equate ' elitist ' with ' intellectual ' .
Thus , John McCain is not an elitist .
Barack Obama is .
To communicate the fate and role of the U.S. effectively according to GOP strategists , you only need name calling in the context of three fundamental concepts : Fear , Uncertainty and Doubt ( FUD ) .
The Republicans figured out this formula a long time ago .
The Dems ?
Well , they 're still trying .
Unfortunately ,
It works every time for the Republicans , not so much for the Democrats , ( though Bill Clinton was a master at beating the GOP at its own game -- that 's why they hated him so much .
The Republicans could not make either title stick , elitist or an intellectual , so to the voting public he looked just like one of their own .
For the GOP Clinton 's successes were like looking in a mirror , only the image reflected back was ugly .
You do remember the Clinton administration , do n't you ? ) .
Watch and see .
Once again the GOP will nimbly ' switch ' the peas under the shells while the Dems struggle to explain ' how ' it 's being done .
The masses , who obviously do - not - give - a- damn about what goes on behind close doors in Washington , will stare blindly into the oncoming headlights one more time .
Election 2008 is sizing up to be very close .
The McCain machine emphasis on identifying Obama as an intellectual and elitist will prove to be a wrong minded strategy for the master party ... big time .
Whether the Democrats win or lose , the Grand Old Party and their neocon party goers will get what they deserve .
They can thank none other than their very own fun guys : Bush , Cheney and the gang , and now the hyped tactic that John McCain is not an intellectual and never will be will turn around and bite them in the ass .
A truism the Republicans will ultimately regret as the voting masses see the real difference between being elite -- McCain , or being intelligent -- Obama .
Just rewards .

Billund , Denmark – The LEGO Company announced today that their highly anticipated addition to the Star Wars lineup will be shipping in time for this year ’s holiday shopping season .
Although costlier than expected , at first glance the new system appears to be a monumental undertaking and is expected to be well received by the LEGO community .
" While the $ 649 price tag will be somewhat more expensive than other Star Wars play sets , we are certain that the 20,000 + piece lifelike recreation of Princess Leia ’s home planet of Alderaan will more than justify the cost , " said Mike Dundle , VP of North American Marketing .
" This LEGO system is an ambitious departure from other Star Wars play sets in that it will arrive in the package fully assembled , ready to destroy .
The planet replica is almost three feet in diameter and includes several specifically designed pieces for mountainous areas , lakes , and populated continents .
We have taken great care to make it look exactly like the depiction in episode IV , ‘ A New Hope ’ in all its peaceful , weaponless glory . "
Dundle hopes the new set will deflect criticism that the use of sets stunts the creativity that the original LEGO bricks were famous for .
" This is a set , but people can find creative ways to blow it up .
Once the set is removed from the package , Star Wars enthusiasts will immediately be able to recreate the brutal destruction of Alderaan piece by piece .
Just imagine how much fun it will be creating your own individual disturbance in the Force , as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced . "
As a part of the promotion , LEGO is sponsoring a YouTube contest to award prizes for the most creative and realistic disassembly .
Submissions are expected to include the use of actual explosives as well as some other creative approaches .

" This is going to be freaking awesome , " said Patrick Sweeley , a twelve - year - old Star Wars LEGO fanatic who ’s been begging his parents since the product was announced , " I ca n’t wait to get my hands on this .
I want to drop it from the roof of my Grandmother ’s 10 - story apartment building onto the parking lot .
I ’m going to try to land it as close to my Dad ’s new camcorder as I can .
This is going to be totally sweet ... "
For the grand prize the winner will be able to choose between a trip to LEGO headquarters in Denmark , or a trip to a real death star orbiting the Earth 's moon .

If you plan to have sex anytime soon , let ’s hope it ’s not in Niger , Africa .
According to the nonprofit organization Save the Children , just 4 percent of couples in Niger have access to birth control .
Although the situation in this West African country is extreme , more than 125 million couples worldwide — most of them in developing countries — cannot get contraceptives .
Some of the children that have resulted from these couplings were wanted and some were not , but one thing is certain : Lack of access to birth control increases the burden on already strained parents and on the global ecosystem .
Sujoy Guha , professor of biomedical engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology in Delhi , believes he has the answer to this problem .
Highly regarded in India for his work on everything from disability rights to drinking - water purification , Guha has spent the last 25 years perfecting his invention , Reversible Inhibition of Sperm Under Guidance , better known ( thankfully ) as RISUG .
RISUG , he says , has all the advantages of the perfect contraceptive — and , some would say , a surprising bonus :
It ’s made for men .
RISUG works by an injection into the vas , the vessel that serves as the exit ramp for sperm .
The injection coats the vas with a clear polymer gel that has a negative and positive electric charge .
Sperm cells also have a charge , so the differential charge from the gel ruptures the cell membrane as it passes through the vas , stopping the sperm in their tracks before they can even start their journey to the egg .
RISUG does n’t affect the surrounding tissues because they have no charge .
Compared to the other male contraceptive choices currently available — abstinence , withdrawal , condoms , and vasectomies — RISUG is a whole new ballgame .
In fact , Guha and others believe , the contraceptive promises to be even better than the choices available to women .
Guha enumerates six advantages of his invention :
First , neither sexual partner has to interrupt the throes of passion to use it — no more running to the bathroom and fumbling with various ointments and plastics .
Second , the process , once it is refined and approved , will be completely non-surgical .
Whew , say a lot of men .
Third , it ’s long - lasting .
According to Guha , a single injection can be effective for at least 10 years .
Fourth , after testing RISUG on more than 250 volunteers , neither Guha nor other researchers in the field have found side effects more worrisome than a slight scrotal swelling in some men immediately following the injection .
This swelling goes away after a few weeks .
Compare that to the Pill , which even today can cause health problems ranging from severe migraines to blood clots .*
Fifth , it works .
Of all the men who ’ve had the RISUG injection ( and 15 of the 250 had it more than 10 years ago ) , there has been only one unplanned pregnancy among their partners — and in that instance , the injection was n’t administered properly .
Sixth , and best of all , the contraceptive appears to be reversible with another injection .
To date , reversing the procedure has been tried only on non-human primates , but among them , it ’s been reversed successfully multiple times .
If RISUG ’s current stage of clinical testing goes well , it will be on the market in India by next year .
Within a few more years , if all proceeds as planned , the injection to reverse it will also be on the market .
Just Shoot Me !
But would men in India — or anywhere else — use it ?
Every U.S. male authority I talked to in the field , including experts at the World Health Organization and the U.S. Agency for International Development , pooh - poohed the idea .
“ Men do n’t like doctors to have anything to do with their testicles , ” summarized Don Waller , a contraceptives expert and professor of pharmacology and toxicology at the University of Illinois at Chicago .
Maybe not — but one in six married men in the U.S. have had vasectomies , which definitely require medical personnel poking at the gonads .
Moreover , surveys conducted by the University of Edinburgh , the Kaiser Foundation , and other entities have shown that in countries as diverse as Hong Kong , South Africa , and the U.S. , the majority of men say they want more options for male contraceptives .
But even if men used RISUG , would women trust them ?
It ’s doubtful that the whispered promise of having been RISUGed would fly during a one - night stand .
However , in the context of a committed relationship , RISUG could shift some of the responsibility for family planning off the women who have borne ( and born ) too much of it for too long , at the expense of their health , time , finances , and emotions .
That shift is definitely possible , according to Ronald Weiss , a vasectomy specialist in Ottawa* , who says men ’s attitudes toward contraception are changing .
“ In Canada , 10 years ago , it used to be tubal ligations [ the more - invasive female equivalent of a vasectomy ] to vasectomies were performed at a ratio of 2 to 1 .
Now that number is reversed . ”
Weiss believes a lot of men would prefer a procedure that was n’t permanent .
And , he says , RISUG is the most promising male contraceptive out there .
Still , there ’s been a lot more media fervor over the possibility of a male version of the Pill — even though its potential side effects for men include everything from liver damage and prostate problems to what is referred to in the literature as gynecomastia .
Translation : Men growing breasts .
Weiss thinks RISUG is preferable .
“ The only people who should be excited about the male Pill are pharmaceutical companies , ” he said .
He believes so much money has been poured into researching the Pill because pharmaceutical companies want something consumers will have to buy again and again — as opposed to an inexpensive , one - time injection .
In the U.S. , a decade of the female Pill costs about $ 3,600 .
RISUG would be dramatically less expensive , while pharmaceutical companies would have to pay $ 25 million to $ 40 million to bring it to market .
But from the consumers ’ point of view , RISUG could be a godsend during the approximately 30 years the average person spends trying not to cause a pregnancy .
It would mean fewer women getting cancer from the Pill or having their uteruses perforated by an errant IUD .
It would mean fewer men having to choose between the risk of a burst condom or the permanence of a vasectomy .
And in the developing world , RISUG would mean much more .
This Little Injection Went to Market …
“ Realize that overseas there just are n’t decent options , ” said Elaine Lissner , director of the Male Contraception Information Project .
“ By the time condoms arrive there , they ’re cracked by the heat .
Poverty and lack of medical follow - up are a problem .
You ca n’t use a diaphragm if you do n’t have clean running water .
You ca n’t use an IUD if no medical treatment exists if something goes wrong .
You ca n’t use the Pill if it ’s too expensive . ”
In the developing world , RISUG ’s price tag could be brought down to about $ 22 , the price at which Guha and Indian Drugs & Pharmaceuticals Ltd. ( the largest Indian drug company ) are planning to market it in India .
This makes RISUG potentially affordable by even the world ’s poorest .
Studies have shown that when couples in the developing world start having fewer children , both the health and literacy of the children improve , and mothers are more likely to survive long enough to raise their kids .
Moreover , families with fewer children have less impact on the natural world , because they are not as desperate for firewood , water , and bush meat .
This “ less children / healthier environment ” connection has become so clear that wildlife organizations have started to team up with family - planning groups in biodiversity - rich areas of the world .
In the Montes Azules Biosphere Reserve in Mexico , Conservation International is working with Mexfam to slow the clearing of the forests as well as to offer people there the option of reproductive health care .

Inevitability , talk of providing contraceptives to people in developing countries raises allegations of racism — but there ’s a huge difference between forced eugenics and offering people the choice to control their own fertility .
According to Save the Children , 72 percent of Sweden ’s population has access to contraceptives ; why should n’t the same choices be available in Niger ?
With the world ’s population growing by 77 million people per year , access to contraceptives is not something the industrialized world can continue to hog .
So far , what ’s holding up the potential marketing of RISUG outside of India is safety testing .
Although the Indian medical community maintains that its safety testing is better than that of the U.S. , Jeff Spieler , chief of research at USAID ’s Office of Population and Reproductive Health , said , “ The pre-clinical toxicology testing in India [ on RISUG ] was weak . ”
Lissner agreed that some of the older studies should be redone , but given the near - perfect record of RISUG so far , she noted , “ If I were a man , I ’d feel safer having RISUG injected than eating non-organic fruit . ”
RISUG will probably soon be marketed in India , but the U.S. will play a critical role in determining its use elsewhere in the developing world .
Grants from U.S. agencies , corporations , and nonprofits spur on a significant portion of the world ’s research .
But , said Waller of the University of Illinois , “ If funds from the U.S. are paying for another country ’s research , then the research has to be already approved by the FDA .
Otherwise it looks like we ’re using the rest of the world as experimental subjects . ”
Thus , lack of interest in RISUG by the U.S. helps delay its use around the world .
Meanwhile the developing world waits .
As Lissner said , “ Every month we delay means thousands more women dying in childbirth , more families in poverty from too many children , and more women dying in attempted abortions . ”

France : Sarkozy government implements repressive police measures
By Ajay Prakash
23 July 2008
On the direct orders of right - wing French President Nicolas Sarkozy , the national security intelligence services have been significantly overhauled , giving full powers to the police to prosecute any individual or social or political organization whose activity is likely to disturb public order .
Thirteen - year - old children can now be prosecuted under this legislation .
Justifying the extension of the collection of police records on 13 - year - olds , minister of the interior Michèle Alliot - Marie said , “ We have observed an increase in child delinquency . ”
These developments represent a major attack on the freedom of expression and a threat to democratic rights .
The mounting social crisis provoked by Sarkozy ’s austerity programme has led to repeated protests by millions of French workers and youth .
These changes are designed to curb mass resistance and political opposition .
A decree published July 1 , 2008 in the Official Journal sets up a new data base called EDVIGE ( Exploitation documentaire et valorisation de l’information générale — Documentary Exploitation and Enhancement of General Information ) .
EDVIGE organises the general and systematic establishment of files on “ all individuals aged 13 and over ... who have sought , exercised or are exercising political , trade union or economic responsibilities or who play a significant institutional , economic , social or religious role . ”
Its mission is “ to centralise and analyse information relating to individuals , groups , organisations ... which by their individual or collective activity are likely to endanger public order . ”
EDVIGE will file even minor details : “ information concerning family status and profession : home addresses , telephone numbers and electronic addresses ... photographs , behaviour ; ID documents ; vehicle number plates ; information on tax and property ; travel and judicial records ... information about the person ’s milieu , especially on present and former relationships , direct or chance . ”
This gives powers to the police to spy on all the movements and private relations of people .
The decree has been criticised by civil rights organisations , particularly regarding prosecution of suspects who are minors .
That the government should take this action is an indication of how teenagers have become politicized .
High school students led mass demonstrations earlier this year against staff cuts in schools .
In the autumn of 2005 , the most oppressed sections of youth revolted in the form of violent clashes with police across the France — a police chase had led to the death of two youth .
The government imposed a state of emergency and arrested thousands of youth and threatened to deport immigrant youth .
Sporadic clashes with youth are endemic .
Justice Minister Rachida Dati , in an interview with the Journal du Dimanche , announced the creation of a “ file on organised gangs ” after an incident on the Champs de Mars by the Eiffel Tower in Paris in June involving clashes between youth and the police .
A Le Monde editorial of June 30 asked , “ Who is likely to get into this ‘ file on gangs ’ ?
People already indicted — but does n’t that exist already ? — or people presumed guilty of offences that they might commit because of their profile or of the company they keep ?
A state governed by the rule of law ( Etat de droit ) cannot accept the penalisation of supposed intentions . ”
The League for Human Rights ( LDH ) has condemned “ an awesome extension of political - police files on citizens ... it is no longer files on the people who have committed proven offences , but for security , to target those who are labelled in advance as future hypothetical delinquents .
Preventive suspicion is enough to justify being put on file . ”
The Syndicat de la magistrature ( Magistrates ’ Union ) calls for opposition to this file “ of anti-democratic inspiration ... it involves informing the government on politically active people and no longer just facilitating the appreciation of a political or economic situation . ”
An essential corollary to this repressive legislation is the creation of the means to impose it .
This is provided by the updating of the Law for the Orientation and Programming for the Performance of Internal Security ( LOPSI 2 ) , which is due to come before parliament in the autumn .
LOPSI 2 is designed to strengthen surveillance and spying via the Internet and the collection of data from personal computers and emails .
The Le Monde editorial of June 24 , entitled “ Security versus liberty , ” states , “ Similarly , the computer filing project Périclès , called for by this draft bill , would vastly extend the investigative powers of the police .
If such a data base were created , it would make it possible to cross reference much information of citizens ’ private lives ( car logbook and driving licence number , cell phone chip or bills ... ) . ”
Fearing that the French state will be discredited , Le Monde stresses that security concerns “ are not enough to justify wanting to insert emergency measures into ordinary law , nor that public freedoms and privacy should be undermined , to a greater or lesser degree .
In the Republic , the ends do not justify all the means . ”
Another sign of the drive for arbitrary repressive powers by the state , free from judicial scrutiny , is contained in a Le Monde report of June 24 that “ the general secretary of national defence ( SGDN ) , Francis Delon , is pressing for access by investigating magistrates to such places of power as the ministries or the secret services to be limited . ”
The intelligence service has been completely reorganised .
Now named the Central Directorate of Internal Intelligence ( DCRI ) , it is the result of a merger of the DST ( Direction de la surveillance du territoire ) and the RG ( General Information ) .
6,000 personnel deal with terrorism and security threats .
The 2008 budget allocated to the DCRI amounts to 41 million euros .
A close friend of President Nicolas Sarkozy , a son of a policeman , Bernard Squarcini , was appointed head of the service .
According to the French Interior Ministry website , the DCRI aims to be an FBI à la française .
For other tasks , such as counting numbers of demonstrators , urban violence and social conflicts [ such as strikes ] , a sub-division ( SDIG ) made up of 1,000 police officers is set up at the Direction of Public Security ( DCSP ) .
There are also several measures in the pipeline enabling the state to censor the Internet .
French Interior Minister Michel Alliot - Marie declared on 10 June 2008 that the French state had come to an agreement with the French Internet Service Providers ( FAI ) to block sites publishing content related to terrorism , paedophilia , racial hatred , and other unlawful sites .
Alliot - Marie announced , “ Since ...
February 14 , we have worked with FAI on the protection of the most vulnerable — This set - up will be simple : the platform , by means of a black list , will pass on to the FAI the list of sites to block ... ”
ZDNet.fr June 11 quoted Daniel Fava , chairperson of the AFA ( Association of Internet Providers and Services ) .
Asserting that no agreement had yet been signed , he said , “ We do n’t want to become ‘ Big Brothers ’ nor that the internauts should feel spied on by their FAI . ”

High energy prices are double - teaming with environmental concerns to prompt broad conservation efforts , with seven in 10 Americans saying they 're trying to reduce their " carbon footprint , " chiefly by driving less , using less electricity and recycling .
More controversial are policy responses to the nation 's energy problems : Majorities in this ABC News / Planet Green / Stanford University poll support oil drilling in protected coastal and wilderness areas .
Most support higher taxes on oil company profits , stricter fuel efficiency rules for cars and controls on trading by investors that may affect gas prices .
And 44 percent favor building nuclear plants -- while not a majority , the most in 28 years .
Overall , even with broad conservation efforts underway , 64 percent now rate " finding new energy sources " as more important than improving conservation -- up 9 points since 2001 .
Previous polls have shown broadest support for alternative energy such as wind , solar and hydro power ; today 's support for oil drilling , and lessened objection to nuclear power , indicate the level of concern raised by the current energy situation .
Global Warming
Another element is global warming ; with concern still running high -- albeit slightly down from a year ago -- most Americans support a so - called cap - and - trade system intended to limit greenhouse gas emissions .
And two - thirds say the U.S. government should act on global warming even if other countries do less .
Nearly three - quarters believe global warming can be reduced only if individuals make major changes in their lifestyles .
Fewer , though , 44 percent , think addressing the issue also will cause them financial hardship , and fewer still foresee " serious " hardship .
Many do see reason to act : Eight in 10 believe both that global warming is happening and that it poses a threat to future generations , and about six in 10 think it 's caused mainly by things people or businesses do .
Overall , 56 percent of Americans give a negative rating to " the condition of the natural environment in the world today . "
And environmentalism remains a political plus :
People by 42 percent to 6 percent say they'd be more likely , rather than less likely , to support a candidate who 's a strong environmentalist , similar to the gap on this question in a 1999 poll .
At the same time , well under half of Americans , 41 percent , describe themselves personally as environmentalists – fewer than in any of six Gallup polls to ask the question from 1989 through 2000 , and far below its peak , 78 percent in 1991 .
Thirty percent of Republicans call themselves environmentalists ; it 's 50 percent among Democrats .
Ready to Act ?
As noted , this poll finds broad conservation efforts under way : Seventy - one percent of Americans say they 're trying to reduce their use of energy or goods whose production created greenhouse gases – that is , to shrink their carbon footprint .
Among those who are taking steps , 59 percent say they 're using less gasoline -- driving less , using smaller , more fuel - efficient cars , carpooling , taking mass transit and the like .
That 's a dramatic shift but not a surprising one , given $ 4 gasoline .
But it 's not all : About as many , 60 percent , also say they 're cutting their consumption of power ( and water ) , and 33 percent are recycling .
Why ?
A third say they 're taking conservation measures mainly to improve the environment , but a quarter instead say it 's mainly to save money -- and more , 41 percent , say it 's for both reasons equally .
Among the nearly three in 10 who are not trying to reduce their carbon footprint , reasons vary , but a fifth say it 's mainly because they simply do n't know how to proceed , which suggests they might take action given more information .
Others are more resistant :
More than half in this group say it 's unnecessary , too expensive , too inconvenient , wo n't do any good , or that they just are n't interested .
Beyond conserving , many consumers are buying products that are marketed as environmentally friendly .
Three - quarters believe such products truly are better for the environment ; two - thirds try to buy them at least occasionally ; and nearly half , 46 percent , try to buy them " whenever possible . "
Nearly seven in 10 also say such products have become more available in the last few years -- an example of the market meeting consumer interest .
Who 's Responsible for Going Green ?
Businesses , in another measure , get as much trust as the government in reducing global warming :
The public divides evenly , 43 - 45 percent , on which would do a better job -- the government , through laws intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions ; or businesses , through market competition .
Nonetheless , 61 percent also say the federal government should do more than it 's doing now to try to reduce global warming , down somewhat from its 2006 and 2007 levels ( 68 and 70 percent ) though still easily a majority .
There are vast partisan gaps on both questions , with Democrats far more supportive of government action , Republicans far less so .
As noted , 44 percent think measures to reduce global warming will cause financial hardship to people like them .
However , fewer , 32 percent , believe such efforts will damage the U.S. economy , even if other countries do n't follow suit – and as many , 33 percent , say taking unilateral action actually would help the U.S. economy .
That result runs counter to the Bush administration 's position that action must be matched by other countries to avoid putting the United States at an economic disadvantage .
Among possible government actions , 78 percent support stricter fuel efficiency standards for cars , 63 percent favor oil drilling in coastal waters where it 's currently prohibited , 55 percent favor drilling in wilderness areas , 61 percent say the government should restrict oil trading by investors and 55 percent favor higher taxes on oil company profits .
( Barack Obama , notably , shifted this past week toward offshore drilling . )
There are sharp partisan gaps here , as well ; Republicans are 20 or more points more apt than Democrats to support oil drilling in currently closed areas , while Democrats are far more likely to favor a windfall oil tax , higher fuel standards and restrictions on oil trading .
Non-environmentalists and environmentalists divide on most of these as well .
There are great divisions , as well , on nuclear power plants : Sixty percent of Republicans favor building more of them ; just 33 percent of Democrats agree .
And there 's a huge gap between the sexes :
Sixty percent of men , but just 29 percent of women , favor building nuclear plants .
And while nuclear power has been proposed as a partial solution to global warming , its support notably low , just 25 percent , among people who see global warming as an " extremely " important problem .
Government Limits
Then there 's cap and trade , a system under which the government would issue permits limiting the amount of greenhouse gases companies can emit , then allow them to sell these permits to each other .
At first blush 59 percent support the idea , and that rises to 74 percent given the argument that a similar system has worked to curb emissions that cause acid rain .
There is price sensitivity : Compared with the 59 percent level , support holds steady , 57 percent , if a cap - and - trade system raised electric bills by $ 10 a month .
But it 's lower , 47 percent , with 51 percent opposed , if the price tag hit $ 25 a month .
Again , cap and trade is more popular among Democrats , less so among Republicans .
Still , in the most basic measure , 52 percent of Republicans support cap - and - trade , vs. 66 percent of Democrats and 60 percent of independents .
It 's Getting Hot in Here
In an open - ended question 25 percent of Americans identify global warming as the single biggest environmental problem in the world , down 8 points from last year but still well up from 2006 .
There 's been a scant 4 - point rise in the number who cite energy or oil , now 11 percent .
There 's also an 8 - point drop in this poll , to 33 percent , in the number who think rising temperatures are caused mainly by things people do , rather than natural causes or both about equally .
At the same time , when those who blame both equally are asked which contributes more , the number citing human activity rises to 58 percent .
( It 's 63 percent when " things people do " is expanded to include commercial and industrial activities . )
Eighty percent , as noted , think global warming is occurring ; it peaked at 85 percent in 2006 .
There 's also a slight , 5 - point dip in the number who say global warming is important to them personally , now 47 percent .
When those who take a middle position are asked how they lean , the number calling it personally important rises to 66 percent .
The declines in these measures come at a time of reduced media attention on global warming , in a year when the election and the economy have taken center stage .
A database search finds 50 percent fewer news stories on global warming in the month before this poll was conducted , compared with the month before last year 's survey ; and a similar 45 percent fewer in the six months prior .
The perceived immediacy of threat remains a factor in concern .
Thirty - seven percent of Americans think that if nothing is done to address global warming it'll pose a serious threat to them in their own lifetimes – a new high , by a narrow margin , in polls since 1997 .
But far more , 73 percent , think it 'll pose a serious threat in their children 's lifetimes .
And 81 percent think it 'll pose a serious threat to " future generations . "
Naturally , those who feel threatened now are much more likely to call it personally important , 69 percent vs. 33 percent .
Nearly six in 10 think global warming is making weather events like droughts and storms more frequent .
But looking at specific events , a majority ties only one , the melting of polar ice , to global warming – 74 percent .
Many fewer , 50 percent , think global warming is associated with the recent severe storms in Southeast Asia , and fewer associate it with the recent flooding in the Midwest ( 45 percent ) or fires in the West ( 38 percent ) .
These views also relate strongly to concern .
People who see these weather events as associated with global warming are much more likely to be concerned about global warming and to support government action to address it .
In their own experience , 43 percent say weather patterns in the county where they live have been more unstable in the last three years ; that 's down from 54 and 52 percent , respectively , the last two years .
There could be a seasonal effect ; those polls were done in March and April , this one in late July .
Science of Warming
Important factors in views on global warming are trust in scientists and perceptions of scientific debate .
Americans divide about evenly , 47 - 49 percent , on whether or not they trust what scientists say about the environment ; those who trust scientists are far likelier to express concern about global warming and to favor action to address it .
Moreover , most Americans , 57 percent , continue to think there 's " a lot of disagreement " among scientists about whether or not global warming is happening ; again , those who instead think scientists mainly agree ( 39 percent ) are more apt to be concerned about it , and to want to see it addressed .
( Even more , 62 and 63 percent , think scientists disagree on how much of a threat global warming poses , and what 's causing it . )
Holding other factors constant , the single strongest predictor of concern about global warming is the belief that it 's caused by human activity .
Concern also is predicted by trust in what scientists say about the issue , belief that scientists agree , and the level of attention people are paying to global warming .
The Great Divides
Attitudes about global warming split along partisan and ideological lines ; for instance , 53 percent of Democrats call it a very serious problem , compared with one in five Republicans .
Concern also is higher among women , younger adults and non-whites , and lower among men , whites and evangelical Protestants .
Women , notably , are much more likely than men to think the environment is in poor shape ( 63 percent vs. 47 percent ) , to think that global warming is caused by human activity ( 64 percent vs. 52 percent ) and to say it 's personally important to them ( 72 percent vs. 59 percent ) .
Contrary to some suggestions , concern about global warming is lower among evangelical white Protestants ( who are disproportionately Republicans and conservatives ) .
They 're less apt than other Americans to see global warming as very serious ( 26 percent vs. 40 percent ) , to say it 's personally important to them ( 35 percent vs. 48 percent ) or to say the government should be doing more about it ( 46 percent vs. 64 percent ) .

EDF pledge to bankroll £ 10bn nuclear project
EDF Energy , London 's electricity company , has told the Government it is prepared to shoulder the cost of building a £ 10 bn fleet of four nuclear power stations without the support of a penny of taxpayers ' money .
In its strongest pitch yet to run Britain 's nuclear future , EDF has submitted costings to the Treasury that would see it build four giant units capable of replacing more than two - thirds of the UK 's current ageing fleet of reactors .
In a private speech to City bankers this week , EDF 's UK chief executive Vincent de Rivaz said using state - of - the - art European reactor technology as its business model for the project would make money for investors .
' There is no subsidy in the business case , ' said de Rivaz .
' There is no line in the budget which is called ' taxpayers ' money ' .
The nuclear option is based on sound economics . '
The pitch from EDF would see the new UK power stations , equivalent to nearly 10 % of the country 's power needs , effectively bankrolled by its parent Electricité de France , by far the world 's biggest nuclear power generator .
' The case for investing in nuclear energy here in the UK and in many other countries has never been stronger , ' de Rivaz told a private meeting at the City offices of French finance house BNP Paribas .
' For EDF and our shareholders , the signs of a nuclear renaissance presents a significant opportunity .
With a positive decision from the [ UK ] Government [ on new nuclear build ] in the new year and with the right framework in place , we will be willing to invest in up to four new plants . '
De Rivaz said EDF would deploy the European pressurised reactor ( EPR ) technology being used at EDF 's latest plant at Flamanville in Normandy , where construction has just started .
The third - generation pressurised water reactor ( PWR ) design developed in league with Areva of France is far more advanced than Sizewell 's PWR reactor , Britain 's most advanced nuclear station but already 12 years out of date .
EDF plans to build the plants in partnership with the British Energy , which owns sites including Sizewell in Suffolk and Dungeness in Kent , or with the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority , which has the keys to defunct magnox stations including Bradwell in Essex .
De Rivaz indicated EDF could build 1600 - megawatt stations at € 3.3 bn each , or less than £ 10bn for the four at 2007 prices .
He said the design , component and manpower cost for the project would decrease , the more stations it is certified to build .
' That is key to why we propose to build not one plant in the UK but four , ' he said .
' It is key to how we manage the business case . '
He shrugged off fears the credit crunch would put off investors , saying : ' In a world where confidence in easy credit has been shaken , only businesses with real strength based on tangible assets can make the kind of long - term commitment that nuclear requires .
' We have that financial strength .
It is based on real , long - lived assets - not credit .
It reduces the weighted average cost of capital and it allows us to invest with confidence . '
People with Crohn 's disease ( CD ) are seven - fold more likely to have in their gut tissues the bacterium that causes a digestive - tract disease in cattle called Johne 's disease .
The role this bacterium may or may not play in causing CD is a top research priority , according to a new report released by the American Academy of Microbiology .
The reports points out that the cause of CD is unknown , and the possible role of this bacterium — which could conceivably be passed up the food chain to people — has received too little attention from the research community .
The report , Mycobacterium avium paratuberculosis : Incidental Human Pathogen or Public Health Threat ? , summarizes conclusions and recommendations from a colloquium convened by the American Academy of Microbiology in June 2007 that brought together experts in microbiology , medicine , veterinary pathology , epidemiology , infectious diseases , and food safety .
Colloquium participants described the state of knowledge about the relationship between Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis ( MAP ) and CD and developed a research agenda to move the field forward .
Scientists largely agree that multiple factors cause CD , including an environmental stimulus , a genetic propensity , and an overactive inflammatory and immune system triggered by an unknown event .
There is mounting evidence that the unknown trigger may be infectious in origin , with several bacteria currently under consideration .
" This complicated network of causation has confounded efforts to understand CD , says Carol Nacy , Ph.D. , CEO of Sequella , Inc. , who chaired the colloquium and is the report 's co-author .
" MAP may be one of the causes of CD , " Nacy adds , " since , among other things , multiple studies identified the pathogen in tissues of CD patients .
Treating some of these patients with antibiotics that target Mycobacteria provided relief from symptoms . "
Johne 's disease is a severe and fatal bacterial infection that strikes cattle , sheep , and other livestock .
MAP has long been identified as the cause of Johne 's disease .
Despite efforts to limit the spread of MAP , roughly 68 % of cattle herds in this country are infected , meaning one or more animals in the herd carry the bacterium and may develop Johne 's disease or spread the infection to other animals .
MAP has been found in some dairy products — milk and cheese — and beef on supermarket shelves .
The critical steps for research now , according to the report , are to determine whether humans are exposed and infected with MAP by eating infected meat and dairy products and whether MAP causes or incites CD or whether it is only incidentally present in those afflicted with the disease .
The prospect that MAP could play a role in the incitement or development of CD is a sobering one , and , once the situation becomes clearer through research , there could be important changes in store for agriculture , food safety , and public health .
It is in the best interest of the public that the possible connection between MAP and CD be explored exhaustively , according to the report .
The research agenda , however , is seriously hampered by the lack of reliable methods for isolating and identifying MAP and for diagnosing people with MAP infection .
Public health laboratories and U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention laboratories have made it clear they cannot grow MAP in the laboratory — an inability that hinders diagnosis and screening .
The report recommends establishment of a task force to develop a specific road map for improved methods for MAP detection and diagnosis .
Waxman wants transcript of FBI Cheney interview Nick Juliano
Published : Tuesday June 3 , 2008
|
Print This Email This Publication of Scott McClellan 's tell - all memoir last week has reinvigorated congressional inquiries into the leak of covert CIA agent Valerie Plame .
Now House Oversight Committee Chairman Henry Waxman is getting in on the act , calling for Attorney General Michael Mukasey to hand over unredacted copies of FBI interviews with top White House officials , including President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney .
Waxman 's committee already has received partial transcripts of interviews with officials who were involved in disclosing Plame 's identity , including I. Lewis " Scooter " Libby , Karl Rove and others .
" In his interview with the FBI , Mr. Libby stated that it was possible  that Vice President Cheney instructed him to disseminate information about Ambassador Wilsons wife to the press , " Waxman wrote to Mukasey Tuesday .
" This is a significant revelation and , if true , a serious matter .
It can not be responsibly investigated without access to the Vice Presidents FBI interview . "
Waxman also cited " additional questions " that were raised in McClellan 's new book , What Happened : Inside the Bush White House and Washington 's Culture of Deception , regarding Cheney 's involvement in the leak of Plame 's identity .
" Mr. McClellan has stated that ' [t ] he President and Vice President directed me to go out there and exonerate Scooter Libby . '
He has also asserted that ' the top White House officials who knew the truth  including Rove , Libby , and possibly Vice President Cheney  allowed me , even encouraged me , to repeat a lie , ' " Waxman wrote .
" It would be a major breach of trust if the Vice President personally directed Mr. McClellan to mislead the public . "
House Judiciary Chairman John Conyers , whose committee also investigated the Plame matter , is mulling calling new hearings to explore McClellan 's revelations .
Two Judiciary Committee members already have said such hearings are needed .
McClellan , Bush 's former spokesman , has faced substantial heat from his former colleagues and right wing commentators for revealing the inner workings of the Bush White House .
Conservative columnist Robert Novak , who first made Plame 's identity public in a July 2003 column , said McClellan got the details wrong about the Plame leak , because he glosses over the fact that former State Department official Richard Armitage was his original source for the CIA officer 's identity .
Waxman said the Justice Department has no reason to withhold his requested documents now that special prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald 's investigation has ended .
Libby was the only official convicted in that probe , but President Bush summarily commuted his prison sentence .
Waxman 's full letter is reprinted below : Dear Mr. Attorney General : On December 3 , 2007 , I wrote to request that you arrange for the production of documents relating to Special Counsel Patrick Fitzgeralds investigation into the leak of the covert identity of CIA officer Valerie Plame Wilson , including copies of FBI interview reports of White House officials .
I appreciate that you have since made redacted versions of the interview reports of Karl Rove , I. Lewis  Scooter  Libby , and other senior White House officials available to the Committee .
I am writing now to renew the Committees request for the interview reports with President Bush and Vice President Cheney and to request unredacted versions of the interviews with Karl Rove , Scooter Libby , Condoleezza Rice , Scott McClellan , and Cathie Martin .
I also request that the Department provide all other responsive documents that were approved for release to the Committee by Mr. Fitzgerald .
In his interview with the FBI , Mr. Libby stated that it was possible  that Vice President Cheney instructed him to disseminate information about Ambassador Wilsons wife to the press .
This is a significant revelation and , if true , a serious matter .
It can not be responsibly investigated without access to the Vice Presidents FBI interview .
The interviews with senior White House officials also raise other questions about the involvement of the Vice President .
It appears from the interview reports that Vice President Cheney personally may have been the source of the information that Ms. Wilson worked for the CIA .
Mr. Libby specifically identified the Vice President as the source of his information about Ms. Wilson .
None of the other White House officials could remember how they learned this information .
New revelations by former White House Press Secretary Scott McClellan raise additional questions about the actions of the President and the Vice President .
Mr. McClellan has stated that [t ] he President and Vice President directed me to go out there and exonerate Scooter Libby .
He has also asserted that  the top White House officials who knew the truth  including Rove , Libby , and possibly Vice President Cheney  allowed me , even encouraged me , to repeat a lie . 
It would be a major breach of trust if the Vice President personally directed Mr. McClellan to mislead the public .
In his FBI interview , Mr. McClellan told the FBI about discussions he had with the President and the Vice President .
These passages , however , were redacted from the copies made available to the Committee .
Similar passages were also redacted from other interviews .
There are no sound reasons for you to withhold the interviews with the President and the Vice President from the Committee or to redact passages like Mr. McClellans discussions with the President and the Vice President .
Mr. Fitzgeralds investigation is closed and he has indicated that it would be appropriate to share these records with the Committee .
There has been no assertion of executive privilege .
Moreover , withholding these documents would create an unfortunate double standard .
During the Clinton Administration , the Committee requested the records of FBI interviews with President Clinton and Vice President Gore in 1997 and 1998 as part of the Committees campaign finance investigation .
These records were turned over to the Committee by the Justice Department without any consultation with the White House .
The Committee is conducting an important investigation to answer questions that Mr. Fitzgeralds criminal inquiry did not address .
As I explained at the Committees hearing last year , the purpose of the Committees investigation is to examine : ( 1 ) How did such a serious violation of our national security occur ?
( 2 ) Did the White House take appropriate investigative and disciplinary steps after the breach occurred ?
And ( 3 ) what changes in White House security procedures are necessary to prevent future violations of our national security from occurring ?
The information that you are withholding may hold answers to these questions .
The FBI interview reports that you have shared with the Committee raise the possibility that Vice President Cheney may be implicated in the release of Ms. Wilsons identity .
Mr. McClellans recent disclosures indicate that both President Bush and Vice President Cheney played a role in directing the White House response .
The Committee cannot complete its inquiry into these matters without receiving the reports of their FBI interviews .
I therefore urge you to follow Justice Department precedents and provide the records of the FBI interviews with President Bush and Vice President Cheney to the Committee by June 10 .
I also ask that you provide to the Committee , at the same time , the unredacted interviews with Karl Rove , Scooter Libby , Condoleezza Rice , Scott McClellan , and Cathie Martin , as well as the other responsive records requested by the Committee .
If you have any questions , please contact me personally or ask your staff to contact David Rapallo or Theodore Chuang of the Committee staff at ( 202 ) 225-5420 .
Sincerely , Henry A. Waxman Chairman
If you have any interest in the Olympics , you 've certainly seen Beijing 's " Bird 's Nest " and " Water Cube . "
But who are the geniuses behind them ?
And what other structures pad their rÃ©sumÃ©s ?
Ben Smith 's got all the answers below .
1. Herzog & de Meuron : The Guys Behind the " Bird's Nest "
It 's stunning that in a skyline packed with soaring structures and modern design , it is a stadium that stands out .
This is n't a fluke , though .
The firm responsible for the " Bird 's Nest , " Herzog and deMeuron , has a long history of designing functional but distinctive structures .
In 2001 , they were awarded the Pritzker Prize , one of the biggest honors in architecture , for seamlessly incorporating cutting - edge materials ( like silkscreened glass ! ) into their highly elegant structures .
In fact , they 've been pushing the boundaries of design for years .
As you might imagine , this is n't the Swiss firm 's first stadium .
They 've also designed Germany 's Allianz Arena ( pictured below ) and the St. Jakob - Park Stadium ( pictured under ) in Switzerland .
The Beijing National Stadium , however , is the most sculptural of the three .
What Herzog and de Meuron seem most known for , though , is their work with museums .
The group gained recognition in this area when they converted Bankside Power Station into what 's now the Tate Modern gallery in London .
On this side of the pond , the best example of their aesthetic can be seen in their expansion of the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis , MN .
The new portion of the museum has doubled gallery space and created a stir with its unusual angles and crinkled - metal exterior .
For a better sense of how much space was added , take a look at the tiny pic below .
The original building is the brick portion to the right .
While the Walker may be my favorite , the IKMZ building in Germany is a close second .
Whatever the facade is created from , it creates a stunning effect .
2. PTW Architects : The Geniuses Behind the " Water Cube "
PTW 's work is n't often as bold as that of Herzog and deMeuron , but their design for Beijing 's Aquatics venue has been making a splash in the design world .
Those eye - catching soapy bubbles are based on the Weaire - Phelan structure .
And the ETFE ( or ethyl tetra fluoro ethylene ) pillows that cover the building 's steel frame work better than glass -- allowing for more light and heat to enter the building , and decreasing energy costs by 30 % .
PTW does have experience with other Olympic venues .
The firm also designed the Olympic Villages for the Beijing and Sydney games and they oversaw the transformation of the many venues used in the Athens games into Olympic - level facilities .
Outside of the Olympic Games , PTW 's work ranges from typical skyscrapers in Australia to more exotic designs .
Perhaps their most talked about ( and frequently web - linked ) project is the beautiful Palm Islands development in Dubai .
3. Arup : The Structural Engineers That Make it Happen
While it is n't exactly easy to come up with the idea for a building that looks like a nest or replicates the pattern of soap bubbles , it 's quite a different burden to get the building to stand up straight !
That 's where structural engineers come in , and Arup provides some of the most creative solutions in the business .
The firm first gained prominence when they figured out how to create the spectacular arcs of the Syndey Opera House .
The structure had been notoriously difficult to implement , and Arup did it by cutting the shapes from hemispheres of the same radius .
Their enormous creativity and massive know - how has pushed them to the forefront of the profession , making them one of the most sought - after structural engineering groups in the world .
The Bird's Nest and Water Cube are n't the only Beijing structures the group has worked on , though .
The team recently recently oversaw construction on China 's new CCTV headquarters .
The building is a continuous loop consisting of two towers connected at the top by a horizontal section .
The result is yet another spectacular building dotting Beijing 's continuously improving skyline .
So , what else has Arup worked on ?
Some of their notable works in Europe includes the Casa da MÃºsica in Portugal , 30 St. Mary Axe in London , and one of my favorite buildings by them , the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris .
Arup 's work covers a variety of different and creative architectural styles that woudl n't otherwise be possible without their knowledge .
Golden Gate Bridge options to prevent suicides GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE Extending railings , adding nets would change span 's looks

Erecting a suicide barrier on the Golden Gate Bridge would cost between $ 25 million and $ 50 million and would alter the look of the historic span , bridge officials said Monday .
Bridge officials outlined five design options that were studied in an environmental impact document scheduled for release today .
Two of the alternatives would extend the existing 4 - foot rail so it would rise to 12 feet in height ; two would replace the entire railing , one with a 10 - foot - tall barrier , another with a 12 - foot - barrier ; and another calls for hanging nets on the sides of the bridge to catch jumpers after they climb over the railing .
The nets would cost $ 25 million , and the four other railing designs would cost between $ 40 million and $ 50 million .
The estimated price is expected to rise the longer the proposed project is delayed , and building a barrier would be a challenge because the bridge district 's piggybank for such a project is bare .
" There is no funding available now , " said bridge district spokeswoman Mary Currie .
Each of the studied alternatives would retain the structural integrity of the suspension bridge .
All the potential barriers - which are intended to impede but not absolutely prevent suicide attempts - would change the look of the bridge , according to the draft environmental document .
The biggest visual impact for those looking at the bridge would be from the popular Vista Point outlook on the north end of the bridge .
The railing options also would obstruct the views from the bridge for pedestrians , bicyclists and motorists .
All the railing alternatives include what would amount to glass windows at numerous points along the 1.7 - mile span to give bridge users unimpeded views when they look at the water and the landscape beyond .
The main visual difference in the railing proposals are whether the designs call for vertical or horizontal stripes .
The study did not determine which design would be most effective in preventing suicides , Currie said .
The $ 2 million study is now subject to a public comment period , scheduled to end Aug. 25 .
The Golden Gate Bridge , Highway and Transportation District 's board of directors , which is made up of 19 representatives for San Francisco , Marin , Sonoma , Napa , Mendocino and Del Norte counties , will then decide whether to pursue the idea of constructing a suicide barrier .
If the directors vote to proceed , they then can pick a preferred design .
The environmental report also provided another option : to maintain the status quo .
Bridge district administrators have yet to voice their preference .
More than 1,250 suicides from the Golden Gate Bridge have been recorded since it first opened in 1937 , and talk of doing more to keep people from jumping has been the subject of public debate for almost seven decades .
But the idea of altering the lines of the graceful Art Deco structure - one of the Bay Area 's most prominent landmarks that is eligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places - has in large part stopped the plan from going forward .
Last year , at least 35 people leaped to their deaths , well above the historic average of about 20 suicides a year .
This year , at least seven suicides have been recorded , according to Marin County deputy coroner Jeff Sherman .
Currie said the environmental study is the most serious review to date in the suicide barrier discussion .
It was pushed in large part by mental health experts , including leaders of the Psychiatric Foundation of Northern California and San Francisco Suicide Prevention .
" A barrier will make a big difference in preventing suicides , " said Dr. Mel Blaustein , president of the Psychiatric Foundation of San Francisco and the medical director of psychiatry at St. Francis Memorial Hospital .
Many times , he said , despondent people attempt suicide on impulse .
He likened the Golden Gate Bridge , with its easy access , to a loaded gun .
Add the allure of the famous span , and it has become the top suicide magnet in the world , Blaustein said .
" There is almost a romance with the bridge as a place to commit suicide , " he said .
" Were there a suicide barrier , a lot of these suicides would n't happen . "
Currie said the earliest the bridge directors would make a decision on the proposed suicide barrier would be October .
If they give the go - ahead , the next step would be to find funding for the project .

Neither Republicans nor Democrats are being spared in the minds of voters , one said .
“ They blame ‘ the government , ’ ” said Ms. Collins , who noted that many Maine residents were panicked at the possibility of paying $ 5,000 to heat their homes this winter .
She and other lawmakers said they could see the contours of a deal that included new incentives for renewable fuels , more freedom for drilling in waters off states that sanction the drilling and a potential crackdown on speculation in the oil - futures market .
In both parties , there was a notable shift in tone .
Senator Harry Reid of Nevada , the majority leader , has made a refrain in recent weeks of saying , “ We can not drill our way out of this problem . ”
But he opened his news conference on Tuesday with a different approach : “ Let ’s begin the discussion here by saying , Democrats support domestic production . ”
He also hinted at a potential element of compromise legislation : that any oil produced from wider access to federal lands off shore be reserved for domestic use and barred from export .
At the same time , he noted that Senator John McCain of Arizona , the Republican presidential candidate , had opposed similar restrictions in the past .
There was no indication from Mr. Reid or other lawmakers that a deal was imminent .
And lawmakers acknowledged that none of the proposals under consideration would lower gasoline prices any time soon .
Republicans continued their call for expanded oil drilling , while emphasizing their willingness to compromise .
“ When I was in Texas this last week , this is the No. 1 issue on people ’s minds , ” Senator John Cornyn said .
“ When people fill up their trucks or S.U.V. ’s in Texas and pay over $ 100 to fill up their vehicle , it gets their attention , and they are looking to Congress to frankly get out of the way and allow America to develop more of its own natural resources as we take other measures to conserve energy and become more efficient . ”

Houses , spaces raided throughout the Twin Cities
Five - year - old child handcuffed and terrorized ; activists allege program of intimidation
MINNEAPOLIS —
In an outrageous series of state - sanctioned actions , police raided an activist “ Convergence Space ” and several homes in the past 24 hours , detaining multiple people on extraordinarily flimsy pretences , arresting several , confiscating computers and laptops , and even handcuffing a small child .
Beginning at 9:17 p.m. last night , with the raid on the St. Paul Convergence Space , and continuing throughout the day today , police harassment and brutality towards the local community has proceeded at an alarming pace .
At least five separate raids have been reported throughout the Twin Cities , with the primary focus appearing to be the confiscation of computers and personal affects .
“ These actions are clearly intended to have a chilling effect on dissent prior to the launch of the Republican National Convention , ” said Natalia , a local activist and mother of two , who asked that her surname be withheld .
“ The message being conveyed is : ‘ If need be , we will terrorize your children to dissuade you from voicing your opinion . ’ ”
Here are the facts as we know them :
• Last night , police raided an activist meeting location .
All occupants , including a five year old child , were detained , handcuffed , and photographed .
Computers were removed from the space , and some personal property ( like notebooks ) were seized ;
• A private residence on 17th St. was raided this morning and had its door kicked in .
The same five year old child was again terrorized by armed law enforcement .
The police continue to threaten to board up the house unless minor code violations ( like a broken door ) are remedied ;
• A private residence in St. Paul , occupied by local residents and out - of - town journalists , was raided on the basis of an identical search warrant to the one presented last night at the Convergence Space ( it specified “ bomb - making materials , ” though nothing of the sort was apparently seized ) ;
• A private residence on Harriet Ave. was raided and has been threatened with being boarding up .
Other , similar actions are being reported , but fuller details are not yet available .
Coldsnap Legal Collective and other groups stand opposed to this program of intimidation and terror .
It is evident from all reports that there was no real concern about “ bomb - making materials ” or anything similar .
On the contrary , these actions were taken to suppress dissent and detain activists .
We call on all residents to contact their local elected officials , express their deep concern , and be prepared for the apparently draconian tactics the police seem to currently favor in their efforts to silence the voice the people in the run-up to the RNC .

Here ’s another reason to double , triple , quadruple - check yourself when you want to add a new feature .
A while back Netflix added a “ Profiles ” feature to their service .
A couple weeks ago , they decided to pull the feature because it was too confusing and it was n’t adding value .
But it was too late .
People were pissed .
The blog post received 1286 comments .
In the face of this reaction , Netflix had to turn 180 and keep the feature .
Whether Netflix Profiles are good or bad , clear or confusing , they ’re here to stay .
The lesson :
Once your user base has grown beyond a certain point , you cannot take features away from them .
They will freak out .
Whether the feature is good or bad , once you launch it you ’ve married it .
This changes the economics of feature additions .
If you ca n’t destroy what you build , each addition holds the threat of clutter .
Empty pixels and free space where a new feature could be added are the most valuable real estate on your app .
Do n’t be quick to sell it , because you can never get it back .
Tens of thousands of pilgrims are expected to attend a papal vigil
Enlarge Image
Pope Benedict XVI has told Australians he is deeply sorry for the sexual abuse of children by some Catholic priests .
Speaking at a gathering of bishops in Sydney , the Pope spoke of the " shame we have all felt " and called for abusers to face justice .
A campaign group criticised the speech , saying the Pope should have met some victims to apologise in person .
The Pope was speaking as thousands of Catholic pilgrims began gathering for a candlelit prayer vigil in Sydney .
The pontiff will lead the vigil at the city 's Royal Randwick Racecourse .
The Pope is in Australia to mark World Youth Day , which is drawing Catholics from around the world to the country .
Mixed response Speaking earlier at St Mary 's Cathedral in Sydney , he said : " I am deeply sorry for the pain and suffering the victims have endured .

Advertisement " These misdeeds , which constitute so grave a betrayal of trust , deserve unequivocal condemnation .
" Those responsible for these evils must be brought to justice , " the Pope said .
Former victim John McNally said he accepted the apology - although the abuse had long - lasting effects .
" It did n't just happen 40 years ago , as in my case , " he said .
" I re-live it day - after - day , and victims re-live their trauma day - after - day .
They need constant care with dignity , and the Church has never provided care with dignity . "
Victims want action , not just words
Broken Rites Anthony Foster , the father of two Australian girls who were raped by a Catholic priest , said : " He [ the Pope ] did n't settle the issue we 're very concerned about - the issue of him taking direct responsibility to ensure that all the archdioceses provide practical unlimited help to the victims of the Catholic Church . "
Daniel Bidinger , a 25 - year - old German pilgrim in Sydney , said the Pope 's apology was " a good gesture " .
" The church should be open about it and should n't cover up these incidents , " he told the AP .
Broken Rites , which had wanted the Pope to meet some of the victims in person , said the pontiff 's apology " is not enough " .
" Victims want action , not just words , " the group said in a statement .
Broken Rites says there have been 107 convictions against Catholic clergymen on sex charges in Australia .
But the campaigners estimate the number of victims to be in the thousands .
There was no immediate confirmation of whether the Pope would meet abuse victims - as he did during a US trip in April , when he also expressed shame for the scandal .
The BBC's Nick Bryant , in Sydney , says victims have complained that the Church in Australia has tried to stall compensation claims and cover up certain cases .
On Saturday , several hundred protesters rallied in Sydney against the Pope 's opposition to homosexuality and contraception .
Police said there were minor scuffles as some of the demonstrators pelted Catholic pilgrims with condoms .

What are these ?
The Australian Government is considering searching iPods at airports for pirated music as part of a secret international treaty .
Under the proposal , customs officials would search iPods or other music devices , and those found with large amounts of pirated music would face fines , and even jail time .
The details of the treaty were not disclosed , but some reports indicate that it is coming from the RIAA in the United States , and if implemented globally could see iPod searches in the United States , Australia , and presumably any other country who signs up .
The million dollar question is how do you identify pirated music ?
It ’s legal in Australia to rip a CD for personal use ( ie , for an iPod ) , so how do you prove , at the airport ( Australia does n’t have any land boundaries ) that the music on your iPod was legally purchased if the CD ’s are in your home ?
Are they seriously suggesting that thousands of people should then be forced to prove the legality of their music , every time they travel ?
Is it reasonable that the time of customs officials be allocated to searching iPods when serious criminal activity could be slipping by ?
It ’s an administrative nightmare waiting to happen .
Yet another infringement on our rights from an industry hell bent on criminalizing the entire population for its own greed .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- President Bush has approved the Army 's request to execute a soldier convicted of rape and murder , the White House announced Monday evening .
Pvt. Ronald Gray , seen here in 1988 , has been on the military 's death row for 20 years .
Pvt. Ronald Gray has been on the military 's death row at Fort Leavenworth , Kansas , since 1988 .
His execution would be the first for the U.S. military since 1961 , but the White House said it expects further appeals before the sentence is carried out .
" While approving a sentence of death for a member of our armed services is a serious and difficult decision for a commander - in - chief , the president believes the facts of this case leave no doubt that the sentence is just and warranted , " White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said .
Gray was convicted of raping and killing a female Army private and a civilian near his post at Fort Bragg , North Carolina .
He was also convicted of the rape and attempted murder of another fellow soldier in her barracks at Fort Bragg .
" The president 's thoughts and prayers are with the victims of these heinous crimes and their families and all others affected , " Perino said .
Both military and civilian courts found Gray responsible for the crimes committed between April 1986 and January 1987 .
Gray pleaded guilty to two murders and five rapes in a civilian court and was sentenced to three consecutive and five concurrent life terms .
A general court - martial at the Army 's Fort Bragg then tried him and in April 1988 convicted him of two murders , an attempted murder and three rapes .
He was unanimously sentenced to death .
Members of the U.S. military have been executed throughout history , but just 10 have been executed with presidential approval since 1951 under the Uniform Code of Military Justice , the military 's modern - day legal system .
Military courts have not yet set an execution date for Gray , who can still appeal through civilian federal courts .
The Army also has sought Bush 's authorization to execute another condemned soldier , Pvt. Dwight Loving , who was convicted of killing and robbing two cab drivers in 1988 .
The last U.S. military execution was in 1961 , when Army private John Bennett was hanged for raping and attempting to kill an 11 - year - old Austrian girl .
Bennett was sentenced in 1955 .
The U.S. military has n't actively pursued an execution for a military prisoner since President John F. Kennedy commuted a death sentence in 1962 .
Six men are currently on military death row .
Bush allowed 152 executions as governor of Texas and has signed off on three executions of federal inmates since he became president -- including that of Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh , who was put to death in 2001 .
CNN 's Bill Mears contributed to this report .
All About U.S. Army Activities
It seemed as if one of the more bizarre incidents of recent years -- the sending of lethal anthrax powder , shortly after 9/11 , to a few senators and newsmen , which led to the deaths of five people and injured 17 others -- might have been on the verge of being resolved .
FBI investigators had focused on one Bruce Ivins , an Army scientist who worked at the Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases at Fort Detrick in Maryland , and had access to anthrax and apparently the knowledge to convert it to powder .
Last month Bruce Ivins killed himself .
Case closed ?
Maybe .
But because most of the evidence pointing to Mr. Ivins seemed to be circumstantial , and because of the importance of the anthrax scare in creating the atmosphere in which it seemed logical to start a war against Iraq , the American people deserve to know everything possible about this case before it is considered resolved .
...
Law enforcement people say the FBI pioneered scientific techniques that allowed it to identify the DNA of the anthrax powder in the envelopes and trace it back to Ft. Detrick .
They also say Mr. Ivins borrowed a piece of equipment that could have converted wet germ cultures used at Ft. Detrick to a dry powder .
However , they apparently do n't have solid evidence placing Mr. Ivins at the P.O. boxes in Princeton , N.J. , from which several of the envelopes were sent .
Several of Mr. Ivins ' former colleagues express doubt he could have done it .
This is a significant piece of our history .
The anthrax envelopes frightened most Americans .
The crude notes sounded as if they were written by jihadists , and advocates of war argued that only Saddam Hussein 's Iraq was capable of producing the powder in question , which fed war hysteria .
The FBI has said it is considering making the evidence against Mr. Ivins public .
It should release all of it , and make it available to independent investigators for evaluation .

Russian authorities have said that Abkhaz rebels shot down an unmanned Georgian spy plane over the breakaway region of Abkhazia .
The Russian foreign ministry also said the flight breached a 1994 peace accord which ended fighting in the province .
Georgia insists a Russian plane shot down the drone on Sunday , calling it an act of " open aggression " .
The country 's defence ministry has released footage showing what seems to be a Russian MiG - 29 shooting the drone .
The video , shot from the drone moments before impact , shows a jet launching a missile over what appears to be the Black Sea .
' Evidence '
" We have hard evidence proving that this is the Russian military aircraft shooting down Georgian UAV [ Unmanned Aerial Vehicle ] , " Temu Iakobashvili , the Georgian minister in charge of the breakaway regions , told the Associated Press news agency .
Abkhazia 's separatist administration has said its own forces shot down the drone because it was violating Abkhaz airspace and breaching ceasefire agreements .
Tensions are high between Russia and Georgia over Russian support for Abkhazia and another breakaway Georgian region , South Ossetia .
International involvement
Russian and UN peacekeepers have been deployed in the two regions since the early 1990s , when violence erupted as they broke free from Georgian control .
Tbilisi believes Moscow is fuelling the separatist conflict in Abkhazia to maintain Russian influence in the region and to damage Georgia 's hopes of joining Nato .
Georgia has requested a UN Security Council meeting on the issue , due to be held on Wednesday and attended by the country 's foreign minister David Bakradze .
Georgia 's deputy prime minister was in London on Tuesday for meetings with British officials to try and garner international support for his country 's position in the row with Russia .
Last week , Georgia accused Russia of trying to annex Abkhazia and South Ossetia by deciding to seek closer ties with them .
[ Bad link ]
by Sheila Casey / August 19th , 2008
US Attorney Jeff Taylor was sweating on August 6 , as he laid out his case against the late Dr. Bruce Ivins at a news conference - and with good reason .
Anyone familiar with the case is well aware that Dr. Ivins was railroaded , and that the news conference was a flimsy web of lies .
Ivins had nothing to do with the 2001 anthrax attacks .
The attacks were almost certainly carried out by the only group that had the means to produce the highly weaponized anthrax in the letters : the CIA , its contractor Battelle Memorial Institute of West Jefferson , Ohio. , and the Army at Dugway in Utah .
The DOJ - FBI frame - up of Ivins rests heavily upon the claim of new advances in genetic testing which supposedly prove that the killer anthrax could have come only from Ivins ’ flask .
Jeff Taylor stated : ‘ The FBI sought out the best experts in the scientific community and , over time , four highly sensitive and specific tests were developed that were capable of detecting the unique qualities of the anthrax used in the 2001 attacks . ’
This is an outright lie .
No special tests were required to assess the genetic heritage of the Ames strain in the envelopes .
The Washington Post reported on December 16 , 2001 that ‘ only five laboratories so far have been found to have spores with perfect genetic matches to those in the Senate letters . ’
The distinguishing feature of the anthrax that killed five people in 2001 is not related to its genes .
What made that anthrax unique was that it was highly weaponized .
Anthrax is a common pathogen found in the soil in many places .
It does n’t become lethal unless produced in such a way that it behaves like a gas , floating easily in the air and deep into a victim ’s lungs .
The anthrax used in the attacks was beyond cutting edge .
Donald A. Henderson , former assistant secretary for the Office of Public Health Preparedness at the Department of Health and Human Services , told Science magazine : ‘ It just did n’t have to be that good ’ to be lethal .
Why the killer anthrax was so deadly
1. Precisely sized particles - 1.5 to 5 microns .
Anything smaller is exhaled , anything larger tends to get caught either in the nose or in the cilia in the trachea .
2. Coated with silica .
The silica acted as a buffer , preventing spores from adhering to one another .
The silica on the attack anthrax rested on a thin layer of polymerized glass , which is a highly advanced technique for coating anthrax spores .
To do this required a ’ spray dryer , ’ the cheapest of which sells for $ 50,000 .
The lyophilizer in Ivins ’ lab is used to dry anthrax , but can NOT be used to coat the spores with silica .
Ivins did not have a spray dryer .
3 . Highly concentrated .
The letter to Senator Daschle ’s office contained two grams of anthrax , about the weight of a dime .
Each gram contained a trillion pure spores of anthrax , or enough to kill 200 million people .
4. Electro-statically charged .
The slight charge on each spore caused it to repel the other spores and spread out into the room after the envelope was opened .
It is these attributes of the anthrax - not its genetic heritage - which made it so unique and so lethal .
The source of the anthrax was clear in 2001
US Attorney Jeff Taylor characterized a flask in Dr. Ivin ’s possession as ‘ the murder weapon . ’
But a Dec. 12 , 2001 article in the Baltimore Sun stated :
For nearly a decade , U.S. Army scientists at Dugway Proving Ground in Utah have made small quantities of weapons - grade anthrax that is virtually identical to the powdery spores used in the mail attacks that have killed five people .
The article refers to Dugway as ‘ the only site in the United States where weapons - grade anthrax has been made in recent years , ’ and also includes this :
Dugway ’s production of weapons - grade anthrax , which has never before been publicly revealed , is apparently the first by the U.S. government since President Richard M. Nixon ordered the U.S. offensive biowarfare program closed in 1969 .
The following day , the Washington Post echoed the Sun article :
An Army biological and chemical warfare facility in Utah has been quietly developing a virulent , weapons - grade formulation of anthrax spores since at least 1992 .
On Dec 16 , 2001 , the Washington Post corroborated the Sun report by stating that ‘ Dugway is the only facility known in recent years to have processed anthrax spores into the powdery form that is most easily inhaled , ’ also stating , ‘ Army officials in Washington said yesterday that Fort Detrick does not have the equipment for making dried anthrax spores . ’
On September 4 , 2001 , the New York Times explained :
Over the past several years , the United States has embarked on a program of secret research on biological weapons … even the [ Clinton ]
White House was unaware of their full scope .
The projects , which have not been previously disclosed … have been embraced by the Bush administration , which intends to expand them .
These projects involve the CIA , Battelle Memorial Laboratories in West Jefferson , Ohio , and the Army at Dugway in Utah .
[ T ]he need to keep such projects secret was a significant reason behind President Bush ’s recent rejection of a draft agreement to strengthen the germ - weapons treaty , [ the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention , ] which has been signed by 143 nations .
Had the treaty been strengthened , the Dugway and West Jefferson sites would have been subject to international inspections .
It is important to note that Battelle not only operates its own labs in West Jefferson , but also is contracted by the Army to operate the labs at Dugway .
The DOJ - FBI news conference on August 6 , 2008 was a deliberate attempt to divert attention from the secret anthrax weaponization projects by pinning the crimes on a dead man .
So far the DOJ - FBI have succeeded in covering up the real perpetrators of the crime , concealing the illegal weapons program , and persuading many that it is time to close the investigation .
Dr. Ivins was an immunologist ; he had neither the knowledge nor the equipment to produce the silica - coated , electro - statically charged , 1.5 to 5 micron sized , one trillion spore per gram anthrax that was mailed to Senators Leahy and Daschle .
The DOJ has made much of the fact that Ivins worked 45 extra hours in September and October of 2001 .
Yet when the FBI attempted to reverse engineer the weaponized anthrax from the attacks , they admitted after a year of trying that they were unable to come up with a product as potent as that in the letters .
Scientists doubt FBI ’s story
As far back as October 28 , 2002 , the Washington Post reported that bio-weapons experts were skeptical about the view that the anthrax in the letters could have come from a lone nut :
‘ In my opinion , there are maybe four or five people in the whole country who might be able to make this stuff , and I ’m one of them , ’ said Richard O. Spertzel , former deputy commander of USAMRIID ( the Army bio - defense facility at Detrick ) .
‘ And even with a good lab and staff to help run it , it might take me a year to come up with a product as good . ’
Writing in the New York Times on Aug. 9 , 2008 , Gerry Andrews , an assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Wyoming , described the envelopes ’ contents as :
“ a startlingly refined weapons - grade anthrax spore preparation , the likes of which had never been seen before by personnel at Fort Detrick . ’
He continued : ‘ It is extremely improbable that this type of preparation could ever have been produced at Fort Detrick , certainly not of the grade and quality found in that envelope . ’
Abundant evidence that Ivins is innocent
Ivins passed two polygraph tests and no link was made between his handwriting and that on the anthrax letters .
Investigators were so frustrated at Ivins passing the polygraph tests that they searched his house for books or articles on how to fool a polygraph , but found none .
US Attorney Jeff Taylor stated that the investigators zeroed in on Ivins when they ‘ conducted additional investigative steps , ’ and thus were ‘ able to narrow the focus even further , exclude individuals , and that left us looking at Dr. Ivins . ’
Those ‘ additional investigative steps ’ were polygraph tests .
Where passing a polygraph test was enough to exclude certain people , it did not exclude Ivins .
Ivins ’ car , work locker , safe deposit box and house were thoroughly swabbed for anthrax spores multiple times over the space of years ; not a single spore was found , although the killer anthrax was so highly weaponized that it behaved like a gas and was very difficult to contain .
None of the materials in the mailings were found at his house : not the tape , the envelopes , nor the pen used to write the letters .
There is n’t one piece of evidence placing him in New Jersey at the time the letters were mailed : not a credit card receipt , restaurant receipt , nor a witness .
On August 3 , 2008 , Glen Greenwald wrote in Salon :
It is so vital to emphasize that not a shred of evidence has yet been presented that the now - deceased Bruce Ivins played any role in the anthrax attacks , let alone that he was the sole or even primary culprit .
Nonetheless , just as they did with Steven Hatfill , the media ( with some notable and important exceptions ) are reporting this case as though the matter is resolved .
Bruce Ivins : juggler , Red Cross volunteer , pianist
Jeff Taylor ’s case against Ivins rests heavily on claims that Ivins was mentally ill .
If Ivins was truly so unhinged , why was he allowed to work with toxic substances ?
His security clearance was never revoked .
Certainly a brilliant homicidal serial killer who is determined to avoid detection would immediately get rid of the Ames strain with the incriminating genotype in his flask , if he had used it to make weaponized powder and kill five people .
Yet seven years later , the same genotype was still in Ivins ’ lab !
The DOJ and FBI ask us to believe that Ivins launched the attacks because his vaccine research was not going well and he feared he might lose his job .
It ’s just not a plausible motivation .
In 2003 , Ivins received the Decoration for Exceptional Civilian Service : the highest award given to the Defense Department ’s civilian employees .
He had been a respected scientist at USAMRIID for 35 years and had a very secure job .
Ivins had been married for 33 years .
He played keyboard at his local church , he was a member of the American Red Cross , an avid juggler and founder of the Frederick Jugglers .
He also played keyboards in a Celtic band and would often compose and play songs for coworkers who were moving to new jobs .
The FBI focused on him as a probable fall guy in 2006 , and for two years was all over him , repeatedly questioning him , searching his home , car and office , and confronting him and his family in public with accusations that he had ‘ killed people . ’
His daughter was shown pictures of dead anthrax victims and told ‘ your father did this . ’
His son was promised $ 2.5 million and a sports car of his choice if he would implicate his father in the anthrax attacks .
Who among us would not resort to drink , or drugs , or fantasies of revenge under those circumstances ?
Who had the expertise to weaponize anthrax ?
William C. Patrick III , and Ken Alibek .
William Patrick was the originator of the first anthrax weaponization process .
He has five patents on anthrax weaponization and wrote a paper in 1999 setting out exactly what an anthrax attack by mail would look like .
Patrick ’s scenario is very similar to what actually happened in 2001 .
For example , he suggests no more than 2.5 grams of anthrax per envelope ; the envelopes contained two grams .
One footnote in his paper reveals ‘ we now have the ability to purify to one trillion spores per gram . ’
William Patrick was a consultant to the CIA , Battelle , the Army , the DIA and the FBI on bio-weapons .
Ken Alibek headed up the Soviet bio-weapon programs until defecting to the USA in 1992 .
He brought with him the technology that was key in the anthrax attacks : using polymerized glass to attach silica to the anthrax spores .
He worked for Battelle Memorial Institute in the late 90s .
These men had to have been instrumental in developing the technology used in the 2001 anthrax attacks .
Who can control the FBI , DOJ and the media ?
The significance of the railroading of the deceased Ivins can not be overstated .
This railroading is not a matter of incompetence .
In detail after detail , the joint FBI - DOJ prosecution deliberately lies , evades and obfuscates in a desperate attempt to pin blame somewhere and close the case .
( A transcript of the entire August 6 news conference is available on npr.org , titled ‘ DOJ News Conference On Bruce Ivins . ’)
US Attorney Jeff Taylor states at the news conference that the envelopes used in the attacks were ‘ very likely sold at a post office in the Frederick , Md. area , ’ and that Ivins had a post office box there .
This is another outright lie .
Taylor ’s own application for a search warrant stated :
[ E ] nvelopes with printing defects , identical to printing defects identified on the envelopes utilized in the anthrax attacks during the fall of 2001 , were collected from the Fairfax Main post office in Fairfax , Virginia , and the Cumberland and Elkton post offices in Maryland .
Taylor and his supervisors at DOJ must be hoping that no one will notice or care that they are blatantly lying about their evidence against Ivins .
Reading the transcript , it is striking how often Jeff Taylor and Joseph Persichini refuse to answer questions .
They either refer reporters to the Department of Defense ( which is not holding a news conference ) or to the documents they have been given .
When asked when their all new , ground - breaking DNA research would be published , Taylor replies ‘ I ’m not going to comment on ( that ) . ’
When asked a direct question about how many others were investigated other than Ivins , Taylor replies , ‘ I ’m not going to get into the details . ’
Not only does he not get into the details , he does n’t even give us the broad strokes .
When asked how he can be so sure that there was n’t another person involved , Taylor replies :
The evidence I described in my statement , and that I ’ve described throughout this question - and - answer period , as I said , led us to conclude that Dr. Ivins is the person who committed this crime .
We are confident , based on the evidence we have , that we could prove this case beyond a reasonable doubt .
In other words , he does n’t answer .
Honest citizens must ask themselves : who are the FBI and DOJ protecting ?
Who has the ability to control and corrupt an investigation of this importance ?
And why , after sitting through a news conference that is obviously a hastily constructed web of lies , have so many journalists dutifully reported the story just as instructed by Jeff Taylor ?
We no longer have a working government in the United States .
What we have are functionaries in various departments - Congress , FBI , DOJ , CIA - who take their orders from the corporations who make vast sums of money waging war and selling vaccines .
Their influence extends to the major media outlets who control the flow of information to the American people .
We are increasingly enslaved , manipulated and murdered by these corporations , and very few of us seem to realize it .

There are the books you read , and then there are the books that change your life .
We can all look back on the books that have shaped our perspective on politics , religion , money , and love .
Some will even become a source of inspiration for the rest of your life .
From a seemingly infinite list of books of anecdotal or literal merit , we have narrowed down the top 100 books that have shaped the lives of individual men while also helping define broader cultural ideas of what it means to be a man .
Whether it be a book on adventure , war , or manners , there is so much to learn about life ’s great questions from these gems .
Let us know in the comments which of these you loved , hated , and the books that meant a lot to you and should have made the list ( you can even get really indignant about your favorite book ) .
And without further ado , this is our list .
To see a list of just the titles and authors names for easy printing , click here .
The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald
Set on the East Coast in the roaring ’ 20s , this American novel is a classic .
From it we learn that often the wanting of something is better than actually having it .
It is relevant to every man ’s life .
Furthermore , one true friend is worth infinitely more than a multitude of acquaintances .
“ He smiled understandingly — much more than understandingly .
It was one of those rare smiles …
It faced — or seemed to face — the whole external world for an instant , and then concentrated on you with an irresistible prejudice in your favor . ”
The Prince by Niccolo Machiavelli
Considered by most to be the authoritative text on statesmanship and power ( how to obtain it as well as an illustration of its trappings ) , although certainly a shrewd one .
“ From this arises an argument : whether it is better to be loved than feared .
I reply that one should like to be both one and the other ; but since it is difficult to join them together , it is much safer to be feared than to be loved when one of the two must be lacking . ”
Essentially , Machiavelli advocates letting your people have their property and women , but making sure that they know what you are capable of doing if they step out of line .
Slaughterhouse - Five by Kurt Vonnegut
Through the beloved Billy Pilgrim , we see the central themes of Vonnegut ’s humanism along with his satirical take on how disgusting it is when humans do n’t use their ( limited ) free will to prevent simple atrocities .
A great example of how we use humor to deal with hardship , and the conflict between the way heroism is conveyed through stories for actions in situations that perhaps could have been avoided altogether .
“ So then I understood .
It was war that made her so angry .
She did n’t want her babies or anybody else ’s babies killed in wars .
And she thought wars were partly encouraged by books and movies . ”
1984 by George Orwell
If you are already worried about the information that your computer is collecting from you , re-read this one and you will feel much better !
Or , perhaps , you will throw your computer in a river .
This is the classic text for the will of the individual to maintain his privacy and free will , and how easy it is at the end of it all to just try to blend in and go with the flow to avoid making things even worse by speaking out .
“ But it was all right , everything was all right , the struggle was finished .
He had won the victory over himself .
He loved Big Brother . ”
The Republic by Plato
Since every man can use a fair portion of philosophy in his literary diet , the origin of legitimate western thought might be a good place to start .
Plato ’s most well known work breaks down topics of which you should have a fundamental understanding such as government , justice , and political theory .
Brothers Karamazov by Fyodor Dostoevsky
The final work of Dostoevsky ( commonly accepted English spelling of the name ) has a lot of meat to chew on …it strikes at the core of who we are and what drives us .
Ultimately , for all of our strength and wisdom as individuals , we are often frustrated by our failures to do what we know we must do ( or at least think we should do ) and need the power of forgiveness in our lives .
Many important thinkers consider this to be one of ( if not the most ) important masterpiece of literature , including Sigmund Freud and Franz Kafka ( who did not think quite alike , to say the least ) .
“ So long as man remains free he strives for nothing so incessantly and so painfully as to find some one to worship . ”
The Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger
Holden Caufield , if nothing else , should serve as a point of reference for the angst and cynicism that you perhaps once had , or ideally never had .
If you thought like him when you were 16 or 17 years old , you are forgiven .
If you still identify with him , you need to find some more joy , somehow … fake it ’til you make it .
Do something .
The Wealth of Nations by Adam Smith
The fundamental work on free market policies : “ It is not from the benevolence of the butcher , the brewer or the baker , that we expect our dinner , but from their regard to their own self interest .
We address ourselves , not to their humanity but to their self - love , and never talk to them of our own necessities but of their advantages . ”
Want an education in economics ?
This book is a great start .
For Whom the Bell Tolls by Ernest Hemingway
Set in the Spanish Civil War , this novel explores who man becomes when faced with the prospect of his own death .
It is worthwhile for all of us to consider what we would give our lives for , as this defines what and who we truly love .
This is one of the great examples of how war has shaped men , past and present , and has in part defined the image of a true hero who is courageous even when it has brutal consequences .
“ You learned the dry - mouthed , fear - purged purging ecstasy of battle and you fought that summer and that fall for all the poor in the world against all tyranny , for all the things you believed in and for the new world you had been educated into . ”
The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde
Arguably the best work from the ever - quotable Wilde , this novel is a guide for how to live a life of pure decadence .
It is packed with impeccable wit , clever one - liners , and an excessive amount of egotistical vanity .
At the very least , this book will show you the glory and the pitfalls of being the best looking chap around .
The Grapes of Wrath by John Steinbeck
One of the most controversial books of its time , the Joads are “ Okies ” who head west to the fertile valleys of California during the Dust Bowl era of the 1930s .
Because of the social solutions that the book proposed , and its depiction of work camp conditions , some groups attacked the novel as communist propaganda .
However , it was widely read as a result of the national attention , and is a classic example of a man doing what he had to do for his family and persevering through all plights and conditions .
“ Fear the time when the strikes stop while the great owners live – for every little beaten strike is proof that the step is being taken … fear the time when Manself will not suffer and die for a concept , for this one quality is the foundation of Manself , and this one quality is man , distinctive in the universe . ”
Brave New World by Aldous Huxley
With a revolutionary and controversial view of the future , Huxley ’s satiric take on the “ utopia ” of tomorrow has provoked reader ’s thoughts for decades .
Depictions of genetically enhanced embryos predisposed to a specific social class cast warning signs for technological interference with human life .
How To Win Friends And Influence People by Dale Carnegie
This is not a Dr. Phil self - help book .
Citing intimate examples from the likes of Rockefeller , Charles Schwab , and FDR , this comprehensive guide is all about how to get ahead in business , relationships , and life .
Read one chapter a day for the rest of your life .
It will make you a far better man than you would ever be without it .
Call of the Wild by Jack London
The tale of a domesticated dog forced to adapt to a life of work in Alaska during the Yukon gold rush .
Most of us can recall rooting for Buck in the ferocious battle to be the leader of the pack .
Make sure that you embrace the benefits of competition to push yourself to become better in your work , but do it without biting and / or killing co-workers .
“ …men , groping in the Arctic darkness , had found a yellow metal … These men wanted dogs , and the dogs they wanted were heavy dogs , with strong muscles by which to toil , and furry coats to protect them from the frost . ”
The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt by Edmund Morris
The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt shows what made Theodore Roosevelt the great man he was .
Reading this book will inspire you to get off the couch and start moving in your life .
Harvard graduate , New York Assemblyman , rancher , historian , author of several books , New York City Police Commissioner , Assistant Secretary of the Navy , Governor of New York , and commanding officer of the Rough Riders are all titles that TR had before he became president at 42 .
Swiss Family Robinson by Johann David Wyss
Every boy can stand to learn a bit of old fashioned resourcefulness from their pops .
Finding yourself on a deserted island is surely the way to learn these skills in a hurry .
Tree forts , treasure hunting , and constant adventure mark the Swiss Family ’s 10 - year run .
Lesson number one ?
Shipwrecks make for some good literature .
Dharma Bums by Jack Kerouac
An idealistic vision from the man who fueled the Beat Generation , a life on the road without concern for wealth or even stability , rather an enjoyment of surroundings , whatever they may be .
This is a great book for reminding us to get away from technology , at least for a day , to appreciate nature and some of the more simple pleasures of life .
Do n’t feel inferior to the beatniks if you still like driving your car … do n’t ever let hipsters give you guilt trips .
“ I felt like lying down by the side of the trail and remembering it all .
The woods do that to you , they always look familiar , long lost , like the face of a long - dead relative , like an old dream … ”
The Iliad and Odyssey of Homer
( 2 - for - 1 special )
Though the authorship is disputed , the place of these two epics in the man canon is not .
Roughly based around the events of the Trojan War , these poems are likely a great collection of common Greek folklore surrounding the events in those days of fierce political turmoil .
It is rumored that there were 10 epics in all , and 8 were lost over time .
This may be a blessing in disguise , because , if they were around , you would never get to the rest of this list .
Catch - 22 by Joseph Heller
The logic here is simple : any book which has the influence to have coined terminology commonly used in our society for decades on end should be perused based solely on principle .
Nothing is worse than a man being caught using language of which he is unfamiliar with its proper meaning or origin .
Also , it is a great book .
Walden by Henry David Thoreau
A bit of isolation never hurt any man .
Thoreau spent two years , two months and two days writing this book in Walden , a cabin tucked deep in the woods near Concord , Massachusetts .
This work of non-fiction describes the changing of the seasons over the course of a year and was intended to give the author an escape from society in order to achieve a more objective point of view .
A real man would take this sabbatical himself , but the book should suffice for those of you who are employed .
Lord of the Flies by William Golding
Primal instincts .
With only the most basic of needs to consider , human nature takes a different approach .
A fictional study of the struggle for power and the unspeakable things that man ( or child ) will do when taken outside the order of civilization .
The Master and Margarita by by Mikhail Bulgakov
There is nothing more manly than a bout with the Devil .
An entertaining commentary on the atheistic social bureaucracy in Moscow in the 1930s wherein Lucifer himself pays the town a visit to make light of their skepticism regarding the spiritual realm .
“ As a result he decided to abandon the main thoroughfares and make his way through the side streets and back alleys where people were less nosy , and there was less chance that a barefoot man would be pestered about long johns that stubbornly refused to look like trousers . ”
Bluebeard by Kurt Vonnegut
Written as the autobiography of Rabo Karabekian , of course with Vonnegut ’s own war experiences drawn upon as inspiration to the aging artist who narrates his own story .
It is a hilarious take on abstract art , and takes jabs at both the inflated self - importance of the artist and the people who simply refuse to look beneath the surface .
“ My soul knows my meat is doing bad things , and is embarrassed .
But my meat just keeps right on doing bad , dumb things . ”
Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand
Exploring the “ virtue ” of living for ourselves , this monster of a book ( 1,084 pages in my version ) is certainly worth plowing through as it is simply a great story .
The fundamental concept is that our world falls apart when individuals stop seeking their own satisfaction through personal achievement and feel a sense of entitlement to the accomplishments and work of others .
This book challenges us on many levels … you may find it conflicting with your value of other people , her treatment of God , or any other beliefs you already hold .
Yet , who can argue with , “ The most depraved type of human being … ( is ) the man without a purpose . ”
The Metamorphosis by Franz Kafka
As Gregor Samsa awoke one morning from uneasy dreams he found himself transformed in his bed into a monstrous vermin .
None of us want this to happen .
Well , most of us do n’t .
Kafka employed terms from law and politics , and was always concerned about some vague , oppressive bureaucracy that sought his ruin , though seeming cool and detached .
We can take something from the very approach of Kafka to his work and find a balance between reading too much meaning into an event and , on the contrary , caring too little and being completely disillusioned .
Another Roadside Attraction by Tom Robbins
Just like The Da Vinci Code , but on hallucinogenic mushrooms … and written 30 years prior .
A psychedelic story of a wandering musical troupe that settle down to open “ Captain Kendrick ’s Memorial Hot Dog Wildlife Preserve , ” and somehow get mixed up with the Vatican .
The motto :
“ The principal difference between an adventurer and a suicide is that the adventurer leaves himself a margin of escape ( the narrower the margin , the greater the adventure ) . ”
White Noise by Don Delillo
This National Book Award winner was more right on in 1985 than Delillo could have possibly known .
The drug Dylar is the supposed answer to man ’s fear of death , yet causes users to lose their minds .
This is an extremely enjoyable read , particularly relevant and funny in its examination of how people act in a climate of fear ( hello Homeland Security ) and under a “ hail of bullets ” from advertisers and imaginary enemies alike .
The lesson : secretly hold out for the wonder drug and / or fountain of youth , but live each day like it might be your last … in a good way …and still show up to work unless you really , really know it is your last day on earth .
Ulysses by James Joyce
Just buy it and put it on your bookshelf and remember this from the book : “ A man of genius makes no mistakes .
His errors are volitional and are the portals of discovery . ”
We suspect that even those who have written their doctoral thesis on the book only pretend to have read every word , but a good friend of mine said not to question an academic on things of this nature , so if you encounter someone who has built a career around Joyce , do n’t ask if they actually read it .
The Young Man ’s Guide by William Alcott
a
The Young Man ’s Guide is a thorough resource which deals with the formation of character in a young man with regard to the mind , manners , and morals .
It also has a good amount of insight on the topics of marriage and business .
A strong foundational book for a young man asking the practical questions of how to live life while minimizing both terrible temporal mistakes and , well … the wrath of God .
As is stated in the introduction , it is Alcott ’s intention to influence young men such that they contradict the stereotypes of thoughtlessness , rashness and an unwillingness to be advised or taught .
Alcott was prescient in writing this book and would probably roll over in his grave if he saw the modern race of man-babies that play X - Box for 20 hours each week and are perpetually bartending their way through junior college .
Blood Meridian , or the Evening Redness in the West by Cormac McCarthy
This Western novel written in 1985 is not only considered to be McCarthy ’s personal masterpiece , but also one of the greatest books of the 20th century .
As the title suggests , the story is marked by extreme violence and contains many religious references .
Is n’t that what the history of man is all about ?
Seek : Reports from the Edges of America & Beyond by Denis Johnson
Through a collection of short stories that take you from a Bikers for Jesus convention to the 13 - year - olds with semi-automatic machine guns in Liberia , Johnson uses rich prose to examine the role of a man as a potted plant , observing his surroundings and soaking it up .
In this story , horrific violence in seeming other worlds contrasts with the comparatively safe process of self - discovery in different U.S. subcultures .
This will absolutely open your eyes to the simultaneous beauty and horror of our world , and remarkably , he does it without sounding condescending , jaded and bitter …he is just there , and you will absolutely see everything that he sees .
“ In the Ogaden , life comes hard , but these have won through yet another day , unlike all the others they ’ve lost to sickness , famine , massacres , battles .
The villagers sit close together , everyone touching someone else , steeped in a contentment that seems , at this moment , perpetual .
It occurs to the writer that the secret way to happiness is in knowing a lot of dead people . ”
Crime And Punishment by Fyodor Dostoevsky
One of the most amazing aspects of this masterpiece is that it was written by Dostoevsky as part of his resolve to deal with some serious financial hardships .
The lesson is n’t to quit your job and write that novel you ’ve been meaning to write … but many of us can relate to that sense of personal ambition and pride in the face of fear and financial stress .
Again , take the moral lessons from the characters ’ mistakes , do n’t model your life after them .
“ ‘ Oh God , how loathsome it all is ! and can I , can I possibly … .
No , it ’s nonsense , it ’s rubbish ! ’ he added resolutely .
‘ And how could such an atrocious thing come into my head ?
What filthy things my heart is capable of . ' ”
… Ah , the classic moral dilemma arising from something as simple as a justified murder .
Steppenwolf by Herman Hesse
The mysterious drifter is always an intriguing protagonist .
One of Hesse ’s best known works , Steppenwolf gained much popularity through the Beat and hippy genenerations of the 50s and 60s which related to his common theme of search for spirituality outside the boundaries of society .
The Book of Deeds of Arms and of Chivalry by Christine De Pizan
An example of what we can learn about being better men from the perspective of a woman ( de Pizan pictured above , instructing her son ) .
She wrote this classic in the 15th Century , a time period not known as the peak of gender equality .
Of course , we can project this into our work and not use the text as the foundation to build a neighborhood militia group .
“ No one is afraid to do what he is confident of having learned well .
A small force which is highly trained in the conflicts of war is more apt to victory : a raw and untrained horde is always exposed to slaughter . ”
The Art of Warfare by Sun Tzu
Written in the 6th Century , this has been one of the most influential texts in strategy and planning , especially emphasizing an ability to adapt to changing circumstances and environments rather than having a rigid plan and staying the course through to disaster .
“ So it is said that if you know your enemies and know yourself , you will fight without danger in battles .
If you only know yourself , but not your opponent , you may win or may lose .
If you know neither yourself nor your enemy , you will always endanger yourself . ”
Don Quixote by Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra
Considered by many to be the greatest work of fiction , it is a goldmine of quotes surrounding a central theme that could be summed up by “ all that glisters is not gold . ”
This is also a great reminder that it is great to be a dreamer and a visionary , but remember to keep ( at least somewhat ) grounded in reality .
“ I would do what I pleased , and doing what I pleased , I should have my will , and having my will , I should be contented ; and when one is contented , there is no more to be desired ; and when there is no more to be desired , there is an end of it . ”
Into the Wild by Jon Krakauer
This one is tough , because you want it but you do n’t … but a wise friend once said , upon being flattered for his world travels , “ Yeah , well you go to all these places always knowing that one day you will come back to somewhere . ”
We all have friends who are , or some of us may be personally , drifters , soaking up each place like a sponge , and then leaving for the next whistlestop .
It is the classic battle between stability / same vs. mobility / change .
In the end , the self - centered opting out of human interaction might not be quite as romantic as you hoped .
All good things in proportion dear friends .
His realization ( “ Happiness Only Real When Shared ” ) is the great counter - balance to that primitive urge to walk alone into the wild .
Or at least think about the fact that snow melts , and rivers get higher .
The Divine Comedy by Dante Alighieri
This epic vision of afterlife is valuable because it challenges us to examine the roots of what we believe and why , and the role of faith in our lives .
Further , it is a vision of a world ( or worlds ) beyond our every day concerns , which is particularly fascinating because it was very much influenced by both Muslim and Catholic thoughts , beliefs and history .
The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien
The precursor to the Lord of the Rings trilogy , this is a good one to read ( or re-read ) in advance of the recent movie adaptation which is being directed by Guillermo del Toro ( Pan ’s Labyrinth ) .
This is the foundation of it all , and this passage demonstrates the effect on all men ( and dwarves ) when faced with the prospect of power .
“ Their mere fleeting glimpses of treasure which they had caught as they went along had rekindled all the fire of their dwarfish hearts ; and when the heart of a dwarf , even the most respectable , is wakened by gold and by jewels , he grows suddenly bold , and he may become fierce . ”
The Rough Riders by Theodore Roosevelt
Roosevelt ’s own account of his experience commanding the Rough Riders in the Spanish - American War .
A great war history from a man who lived it himself .
From his account , a man can learn what it means to be a true leader .
TR set the example for his men and they followed because they simply respected him .
East of Eden by John Steinbeck
Considered by Steinbeck himself to be the work that he had been preparing for throughout his entire life .
If you have had the chance to read this , or if anyone has ever talked about this book to you …perhaps you have been graced to read or even hear an excerpt from the legendary opening to Chapter 13 :
Sometimes a kind of glory lights up the mind of a man .
It happens to nearly everyone .
You can feel it growing or preparing like a fuse burning toward dynamite [ … ]
Then a man pours outward , a torrent of him , and yet he is not diminished .
And I guess a man ’s importance in the world can be measured by the quality and number of his glories .
It is a lonely thing but it relates us to the world .
It is the mother of all creativeness , and it sets each man separate from all other men .
Leviathan by Thomas Hobbes
Written during the English Civil War , Hobbes ’ work is one of the foremost authorities in political theory and contributed greatly to Enlightenment philosophy .
Leviathan ’s primary concern is the centralized power of the sovereign state existing to maintain order and peace both within and without .
A valuable resource , as a man never knows when he is going to be commissioned with the task of forming a new government .
“ In the first place , I put for a general inclination of all mankind , a perpetual and restless desire of power after power , that ceaseth only in death . ”
The Thin Red Line by James Jones
The author ’s fictional depiction of the Guadalcanal Campaign during WWII .
Portraying various wartime activities most would consider repulsive , Jones gives account without judgment .
With the current events of Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo Bay , this work is very relevant today .
Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain
A satirical depiction of the social climate in the South just before the turn of the century , “ Huck Finn ” is largely considered to be the first Great American Novel .
Twain ’s take on the issue of racism and slavery was initially criticized upon publication and remains largely controversial to this day .
The Politics by Aristotle
From the man that gave pointers to Alexander the Great we can all take note .
His writings created the first comprehensive system of philosophy , including morality and aesthetics , logic and science , politics , and metaphysics .
Though it is thought that much of Aristotle ’s work has been lost over the years , it is not a bad idea to take in the surviving words from one of the founding figures of Western Philosophy .
“ Now if some men excelled others in the same degree in which gods and heroes are supposed to excel mankind in general … so that the superiority of the governors was undisputed and patent to their subjects , it would clearly be better that once for all the one class should rule and the others serve .
But since this is unattainable , and kings have no marked superiority over their subjects … it is obviously necessary on many grounds that all the citizens alike should take their turn of governing and being governed . ”
First Edition of the The Boy Scout Handbook
This is the book that started the Boy Scout movement .
If you ’re a former Boy Scout , you ’ll be amazed at the amount of useful information the first edition manual has compared to Scout manuals today .
In addition to teaching essential scouting skills , the first edition of the Boy Scout Handbook also includes stories of adventure and bravery that will excite and inspire any man .
Cyrano de Bergerac by Edmond Rostand
A poet , musician , and expert swordsman .
That is a true Renaissance Man .
Unfortunately , Cyrano had a tragically large nose which affected his confidence enough to keep him from professing his love for the fair Roxanne , even on his deathbed .
I was n’t exaggerating when I used the word “ tragic . ”
Also , one must respect the play responsible for introducing the word “ panache ” to the English language .
Tropic of Cancer by Henry Miller
For its honest and graphic depiction of sex , this book was deemed “ pornographic ” by state courts upon its New York publishing in 1961 .
This ruling , however , was later overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court and the book became very influential in the sexual revolution of the 60s and 70s .
The Crisis by Winston Churchill
A fictional Civil War era romance between a New England lawyer and a southern belle , written by the “ American Churchill ” but often mistaken for the British Prime Minister who shared the same name .
Out of respect for the American ’s work , the British Churchill offered to add his middle initial to any of his own published writings to avoid confusion .
The Naked and The Dead by Norman Mailer
Taking place in World War II , this is widely considered to be one of the best war novels ever written .
As a young man , Mailer showed extraordinary insight into power relationships between the soldiers and their superiors .
Further , the soldiers also deal with various degrees of compassion while fighting to maintain a belief in the capacity of humanity to be good while engaging in the brutality of war and being forced to follow orders against their ideals in some cases .
A prime example of his superb insight into the workings of many systems and organizational structures , which is still relevant in today ’s wars and corporations alike :
“ To make an Army work you have to have every man in it fitted into a fear ladder …
The Army functions best when you ’re frightened of the man above you , and contemptuous of your subordinates . ”
Hatchet by Gary Paulsen
A classic from our youth , the main character ( Brian ) deals with his parents ’ strained relationship by fleeing into the wilderness for a sort of accidental , self - inflicted rite of passage .
Perhaps the greatest pearl of wisdom comes early in the book , foreshadowing his quest for survival :
“ All flying is easy .
Just takes learning .
Like everything else .
Like everything else . ”
Animal Farm by George Orwell
An advanced politics lesson under the guise of a childish farm tale .
The allegorical story representing Soviet totalitarianism simplifies social systems to show the endless corruption and manipulation that stems from the struggle for power .
Also , it takes no small amount of courage to take jabs at Mr. Stalin himself .
Tarzan of the Apes by Edgar Rice Burroughs
Gentleman ?
No. Man ?
Most certainly .
Having been raised by apes gives our protagonist more than a leg up on the competition when it comes to survival skills .
He was a pretty big hit with the ladies as well .
Originally published in the All - Story Magazine in 1912 , Tarzan of the Apes led to 23 sequels and many more depictions of the famous character in various other forms of media .
Beyond Good and Evil by Freidrich Nietzsche
With his denunciation of philosophers before him as lacking critical thought and mindlessly adhering to Christian tenets , Nietzsche took philosophy beyond religion , thus founding the Existentialist Movement .
Questioning even the most basic of truths , Nietzsche writes that “ from every point of view the erroneousness of the world in which we believe we live is the surest and firmest thing we can get our eyes on . ”
Staging a complete overhaul of the philosophical landscape is beyond ambitious and worthy of your attention .
No matter what your beliefs , it is good to examine why you believe what you believe without fear of what you might discover .
The Federalist Papers by Alexander Hamilton , John Jay , and James Madison
Composed of 85 articles , The Federalist Papers served to explain and encourage ratification of the U.S. Constitution .
The majority of the essays were penned by Hamilton and published in The Independent Journal and The New York Packet .
It is rumored that Hamilton used up most of his wisdom in the writing process , as he later lost his life in a duel , which is essentially two men in close proximity firing bullets at each other without trying to get out of the way .
Moby Dick by Herman Melville
If you ever find yourself on a boat in search of a savage beast , and you encounter a boat that is looking for some of their missing friends that seem to have been attacked by that same whale that you are looking for , take a minute and think .
Cost : Possibly your life .
Benefit :
You kill a big whale .
AND you get some serious props .
“ By this , he seemed to mean , not only that the most reliable and useful courage was that which arises from the fair estimation of the encountered peril , but that an utterly fearless man is a far more dangerous comrade than a coward . ”
Essential Manners for Men by Peter Post
Lay to rest all situational conundrums you encounter in daily life .

Frankenstein by Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley
Before you get too excited about having your clone or some other cyborg cleaning your house and picking up the dry cleaning … just remember that the cost of the convenience might be the life of your brother , your wife , your friend , and eventually when you track the rogue creature down , you will come really close to revenge but just get sick and die .
And to top it off , somehow people will dress up as the beast and also feel sympathy towards him , because it was n’t even his fault that he was created .
He just wanted to be loved by his creator , and when he did n’t get it , he went crazy .
Just have kids and tell them to clean your house , and love them so that they do n’t act like the monster .
Hamlet by Shakespeare
The longest of Shakespeare ’s plays , it is a tragedy that has been remade repeatedly , and with good reason as it explores the depths of man ’s desire for revenge .
400 years after it was written , it is still powerful enough to make us root for Hamlet to avenge his father ’s death , even as some superior morality might call for mercy .
“ There ’s a divinity that shapes our ends , Rough - hew them how we will . ”
The Boys of Summer by Roger Kahn
What is a man ’s library without some literature on America ’s favorite pastime ?
Dubbed “ The finest American book on sports , ” The Boys of Summer is an account of the Brooklyn Dodgers leading up to their 1955 World Series victory .
Kahn ’s depiction of some of the game ’s greatest legends like Gil Hodges and Duke Snyder is so inspiring to make a man desire another shot on the diamond .

After healing and having impregnated nurse Barkley , Henry returns to his unit , only to narrowly escape fratricide .
Henry goes AWOL and he and his bird flee to neutral Switzerland where they live a peaceful existence until Barkley dies during childbirth .
In typical Hemingway fashion , he mourns her death by simply walking back to his hotel in the rain .
The Stranger by Albert Camus
Perhaps the most popular piece of 20th century “ existential ” literature .
The Stranger addresses murder and remorse ( or lack thereof ) , God and atheism , destiny and justice , and consequently , indifference .
Camus ’ anti-hero , Meursault is perhaps the ultimate man — unable to cry at his own funeral , and one of the final lines of the novel reads , “ … I had only to wish that there be a large crowd of spectators the day of my execution and that they greet me with cries of hate . ”
Camus gets a special nod for his manliness for being an active member in the French Resistance during WWII .
And you probably thought no Frenchmen would be on this list .
Robinson Crusoe by Daniel Dafoe
Robinson Crusoe deals with mastery and morality .
It addresses the ability of mankind to master his surroundings through hard work , and patience and faith , which eventually enable him to survive on an
unknown island and able to cope with the difficult terrain , less - than - friendly natives and basically every wicked trial that comes his way .
The morality addressed in this book is the eponymous protagonist ’s rejection of his father ’s advice to accept the happiness of the middle class life from which he was born .
Against the wishes of his family , he runs off to sea to find adventure .
It is not until Crusoe literally recreates a primitive approximation of that middle class life for himself on his island that he is freed .
The Pearl by John Steinbeck
A story about the ill - fate of a poor pearl diver , Kino and his wife and infant .
The Pearl starts with Kino ’s son Coyotito having been stung by a scorpion , and being as though they are so poor , Kino has to dive to find a pearl to sell in - order to pay for his son ’s medical attention .
After finding the largest Pearl known to his region , word spreads and everyone is after his score .
Eventually his son recovers naturally and the fate of the Pearl consumes the entire region , including Kino .
Kino does all he can to protect his beloved family while fleeing north to sell the pearl for a better life for them .
Eventually , a bounty hunter ’s stray bullet kills his son , and upon realizing the misfortune this great treasure brought him Kino hurls it back into the sea .
A melancholy ending yes , an endorsement of socialism perhaps … but as a reflection of what a man will do for his family , it is pretty spot-on .
On the Road by Jack Kerouac
The stream of consciousness drifting ( see the 120 foot long manuscript scroll above ) has helped us experience that sacred institution of just going , and using our own language to experience the rapid unfolding of a new town as a rich flash in a pan .
Lucky for all of us , he has saved us the trouble of popping Benzedrine for 3 weeks and experiencing our own mad visions , and we can simply join his world without ferociously grinding our teeth ( though Kerouac said it was made possible by coffee alone ) .
If you have n’t read it , get it now please .
If you have , you know that you will never complain about a long drive again , whether alone or with the boys .
Treasure Island by Robert Louis Stevenson

“ Here it is about gentlemen of fortune .
They lives rough , and they risk swinging , but they eat and drink like fighting - cocks , and when a cruise is done , why , it ’s hundreds of pounds instead of hundreds of farthings in their pockets . ”
A Confederacy of Dunces by John Kennedy Toole
First published in 1980 , 11 years after the author ’s suicide , this New Orleans - based novel went on to win Toole the Pulitzer Prize in Fiction .

This book serves as a guide for what a man ought not to be , while providing sound entertainment all the while .
Foucault ’s Pendulum – Umberto Eco
Italian novelist and philosopher Umberto Eco first published this work in 1988 , which tells the story of three friends who create their own historical conspiracy to entertain themselves .
“ The Plan ” becomes more intelligent and complex , and they begin to make believers of others , and even themselves .
As they become wrapped up in a series of events beyond their control , the book displays the inherent credulity of man .
Getting lost in a “ Choose Your Own Adventure ” that becomes a reality is every grown boy ’s dream .

Fear and Trembling by Soren Kierkegaard
In this book Kierkegard creates a case study from the famous bible story ( Genesis 22 ) from when Abraham is famously commanded by God to sacrifice his son Isaac .
Kierkegaard uses the story as an opportunity to question the philosophy of religion , the relationship between philosophy and religion , the nature of God and faith , faith ’s relationship with ethics and morality , and the difficulty of being authentically religious .
It is manly to ask questions about the bigger things – there is more to life than sports .
Undaunted Courage by Stephen Ambrose
Undaunted Courage is a compelling account of the Lewis and Clark expedition through the Louisiana Territory .
The book is thoroughly researched and extremely well written .
The bravery and courage of the explorers should inspire any man .
Paradise Lost by John Milton
John Milton ’s Paradise Lost is a timeless hard - to - read classic .
Its imagery has shaped how the Western world views Christianity , sin , the fall , life , death , heaven , and hell .
Unlike many of his predecessors , Milton concentrated on more humanist elements .
Reading Milton might or might not change your view of God and man , but absorbing him will change your love of language .
The words are vivid and powerful and beg to be read aloud .
Cannery Row by John Steinbeck
A man , no matter his class or situation , needs a healthy appreciation for the simple folk .
The working class ; the laborers compose the backbone of society .
Steinbeck ’s Cannery Row depicts a cross-section of this community , located on a strip of sardine canneries , in the late Depression era .
This area has a life of its own , and is as much a character of the book as any of the community members themselves .
The novel not only paints a picture of a difficult time that has passed , but gives honest insight into the human condition that is timeless .

Remind any of you good ol ’ boys of that girl in high school who kept running back to the man who did n’t deserve her affections ?
Well , in this case , the girl runs back to Rogozhin , who , in spite of and perhaps because of his deep passion , rewarded her by …killing her .
Myshkin is considered the “ idiot ” because of his innocence and trust in the best of humanity as it could be , and in the end , his optimism and love for humanity are his undoing in the face of a dark , materialistic society .
The lesson : do n’t marry a woman to save her from another man…although , come to think of the end of Super Mario Bros …

The Bible
Despite being one of the most religious industrialized nations , America ’s religious literacy is horrible .
If asked to name one of the Ten Commandments or one of Jesus ’ apostles , many Americans would n’t be able to do it .
The problem is half the books on these lists make Biblical references that must be known by the reader for them to understand the message of that book .
If a Western man desires to understand the culture that surrounds him , he needs to have a thorough understanding of the Book that has shaped that culture .
In addition , the Bible is full of ancient counsel and advice that is applicable to today ’s man , whether you ’re a believer in God or not .

OGA , Japan 
The Japanese have long taken an easygoing , buffetlike approach to religion , ringing out the old year at Buddhist temples and welcoming the new year , several hours later , at Shinto shrines .
Weddings hew to Shinto rituals or , just as easily , to Christian ones .
When it comes to funerals , though , the Japanese have traditionally been inflexibly Buddhist  so much so that Buddhism in Japan is often called “ funeral Buddhism , ” a reference to the religion ’s former near - monopoly on the elaborate , and lucrative , ceremonies surrounding deaths and memorial services .
But that expression also describes a religion that , by appearing to cater more to the needs of the dead than to those of the living , is losing its standing in Japanese society .
“ That ’s the image of funeral Buddhism : that it does n’t meet people ’s spiritual needs , ” said Ryoko Mori , the chief priest at the 700 - year - old Zuikoji Temple here in northern Japan .
“ In Islam or Christianity , they hold sermons on spiritual matters .
But in Japan nowadays , very few Buddhist priests do that . ”
T. Boone Pickens is more than just an opinionated fellow who talks a big game .

Pickens ' words more than just wind
No doubt there are a lot of folks out there with grand schemes and blue - sky brainstorms about how to tackle America ’s energy problems .
But T. Boone Pickens is more than just an opinionated fellow who talks a big game .
He ’s an opinionated fellow who talks a big game and is backed up by an even bigger bank roll , estimated at $ 4 billion .

Little wonder then that Pickens is stirring a gust on Capitol Hill , quickly becoming the hot ticket with his self - financed campaign to put wind power at the center of the nation ’s energy strategy , while the political world is newly focused on $ 4 - a - gallon gasoline and energy independence .
He meets Tuesday with the entire House Democratic Caucus .
The Texas oilman has not always been the most popular fellow among this group during his long career as a corporate raider , which started in the 1980s — not to mention his role as a funder of the Swift Boat Veterans in the 2004 presidential campaign .
In an interview , Pickens said Democrats reached out to him .
“ I have n’t come up here trying to talk to anybody , ” he said .
“ I felt like the grass roots is where I ’d have my support . ”
See Also Erika Lovley talks about Pickens ’ plan
Indeed , just last week , the “ Pickens Plan , ” which he ’s touting in a lavishly funded national television , Internet and newspaper campaign , was drawing mostly shrugs on Capitol Hill .
Many congressional offices knew no details of the plan , and most staffers said their bosses were too busy to bother .
But that ’s before word got around that Pickens was coming to town .
His campaign reported “ dozens and dozens ” of requests for sit - down meetings .
“ Then I started to hear from friends on both sides that called me , ” Pickens recalled .
“ I talked to the speaker , and I ’ve got a meeting with Mitch McConnell .
They called and wanted to know what I ’m up to . ”
Some are skeptical of the Pickens Plan , which calls for the government to help fund construction of new wind generation facilities to produce 20 percent of the nation ’s electricity and slash one - third of foreign oil imports over the next 10 years .
Some are skeptical , too , of his motives , saying Pickens is looking to benefit his BP Capital Management company , which invests heavily in renewable energy .
But , munching on Famous Amos chocolate - chip cookies in his Hay - Adams hotel suite , the 80 - year - old Pickens said he ’s in a new phase of his life .
“ I did n’t want to come and go in this life and feel like I had something that would ’ve helped the country , ” he said .
“ So I thought , ‘ What the hell , it ’s time to stand up and be counted . ’”
The hoopla has already attracted the interest of the nation ’s top political players , including President Bush , former Vice President Al Gore , former House Speaker Newt Gingrich , Ralph Nader and Warren Buffett .
Pickens says imports are costing America $ 700 billion a year , asserting that this will eventually be the largest transfer of wealth in history .
The switch to wind for some of the country ’s electricity needs would allow natural gas to be conserved for use in motor vehicles , which would burn more cleanly at a cost of only $ 1 per gallon in some parts of the country .
“ I want to elevate my plan into this presidential debate and the very critical situation that the country ’s facing right now regarding how much oil we ’re importing , ” Pickens said .
“ I ’d like to see it [ implemented ] in the first 100 days of the next presidency . ”
Pickens has already spent a bundle unveiling his plan , committing to spend $ 58 million through the end of the year .
And he already has a handful of lobbyists on staff and may add more .
The American Wind Energy Association and the Sierra Club are helping him push parts of his massive wind lobbying campaign in the coming months .
But do lawmakers like what they hear ?
Some , including Sen. Jim Inhofe ( R - Okla . ) and Rep. Earl Pomeroy ( D - N.D. ) , do .
Pomeroy ’s home state has the most wind power potential , according to wind experts .
And Pickens plans to stake wind turbines on private lands from the Texas Panhandle to the Dakotas , providing extra revenue for ranchers and farmers .
“ By building wind towers , rural and remote areas have an opportunity to make a very substantial contribution , ” Pomeroy said .
“ To me , Pickens has given the debate an important jump - start . ”
Still , Pickens has a tough sell ahead of him .
He has invited both presidential contenders — Republican John McCain and Democrat Barack Obama — to a three - way meeting with him on his plan , but so far neither has responded .
“ This is a nonpartisan approach I ’m using , ” Pickens explained .
“ In the end , it will come down to leadership .
Whoever is the best leader has got to come up with something to solve the problem . ”
He ’s also moving swiftly to separate his plan from Gore ’s new global warming blueprint , a 10 - year proposal that calls for the nation to generate all of its electricity from alternate fuels .
“ He is solving global warming .
... I ’m solving another problem , ” Pickens said .
“ His is global warming , and mine is the transfer of $ 700 billion . ”
Some members also have their doubts about the feasibility of the Pickens Plan .
To start , it requires Congress to approve billions of dollars in subsidies for renewable energy — something the Senate has fought over for months .
“ I ’m not entirely convinced , ” said Rep. John E. Peterson ( R - Pa. ) , whose state is being eyed by gas production companies as the next natural gas mecca .
“ I have no problem developing wind farms , but I ’m not sure how Pickens plans to suddenly explode wind energy to 20 percent . ”
The American Petroleum Institute and other oil industry supporters warn that converting the automobile fleet to natural gas will require major infrastructure changes at gas stations — and it wo n’t be cheap .
Currently , there are only 785 natural gas fueling stations in the country .
“ Pickens is an experienced man who ’s put a lot of his own money into his own plan , ” said Sen . Tom Coburn ( R - Okla . ) .
“ He ’s going to give this plan some legs , but I ’m not sure we want to retrofit every gas station with natural gas . ”
Reaching congressional consensus on energy legislation is another lofty goal .
Pickens is aiming to have his plan implemented within the first 100 days of a new administration that will face huge problems : a sputtering economy and wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , among other pressing issues .
If lawmakers are eyeing the billionaire for his campaign donations , though , he ’s holding back .
“ I ’m not giving any money in this campaign , ” he said .
“ I ’m out this presidential term — it ’s a total nonpartisan position . ”
Pickens , though , has contributed in this election cycle , according the Center for Responsive Politics .
He gave the National Republican Congressional Committee $ 15,000 last spring and contributed $ 4,600 to Rudy Giuliani ’s unsuccessful bid for the Republican presidential nomination .
Still , Pickens is doing an about - face from his stance in 2004 , when he gave $ 3 million to Swift Boat Veterans for Truth , a 527 independent group that funded a negative advertising campaign credited with heavily damaging the Democratic presidential campaign of Massachusetts Sen.
John F. Kerry .
Some do n’t see simple altruism at work behind Pickens ’ moves .
“ I would put a caveat on his past actions , ” said one Midwestern Republican senator who asked not to be identified .
“ It ’s a pretty self - serving plan .
He wants the government to pay for transmission lines that he ’ll benefit from . ”
Responding , Pickens said : “ I ’m 80 years old , and I ’m worth $ 4 billion .
I have plenty of money .
“ I think it shows leadership that I ’m putting my money into the wind business , and I ’m willing to put my money where my mouth is . ”
The easiest people to convince have been grass - roots supporters , whom Pickens fondly calls “ Boone ’s Army . ”
Nearly 65,000 of them have joined his network , making the Pickens Plan website among the 1,000 most heavily trafficked in the world .
“ Even if this plan does n’t happen , I ’ve spent my money and done what I wanted to do , ” Pickens said .
“ I have no personal motive in this at all , except that it will help the country . ”
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Officials with the McCain campaign and the Republican National convention are considering changing the event 's agenda as Hurricane Gustav bears down on the Gulf Coast .
The Republican National Convention is set to kick off Monday in Minneapolis - St. Paul , Minnesota .
Sen .
John McCain 's campaign manager , Rick Davis , plans to meet with officials in charge of the party 's convention planning in Minneapolis - St.
Paul on Sunday to review the latest news on Hurricane Gustav and what their options might be and then consult with the presumptive presidential nominee to determine what changes may need to be made .
" I would n't call it a nightmare , but it is a very perplexing challenge , " said a GOP official planning the event .
A senior McCain source said Saturday that officials are considering turning the convention into a service event , a massive telethon to raise money for the Red Cross and other agencies to help with the hurricane .
" He wants to do something service - oriented if and when the storm hits and it's as bad as its expected to be now , " the McCain source said .
They are also hoping to get McCain himself to a storm - affected area as soon as possible .
McCain had suggested to a Fox News interviewer that the convention could be suspended if it seemed that a festive gathering was inappropriate in light of the destruction the storm may bring .
Watch as the Gulf Coast prepares for Gustav »
President Bush , who is scheduled to address the convention Monday night , is making contingency plans in case the storm keeps him in Washington .
White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said there are " no schedule changes yet , but we 're making contingency plans " because of the hurricane .
She said it is a " serious and scary situation , " so the White House is " closely monitoring " the storm .
A Republican official involved in convention planning said that various options are being explored , including having the president speak to Republican delegates via satellite and updating them on the storm rather than traveling to Minnesota .
Perino said she expects to have more details by Sunday morning .
Republican Govs. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana , Charlie Crist of Florida , Haley Barbour of Mississippi and Rick Perry of Texas -- whose states that lie in the path of Gustav , named a Category 4 hurricane Saturday afternoon -- will skip the GOP convention because of the storm .
The storm has forced last - minute changes in the convention 's announced schedule :
If the convention -- originally scheduled to start Monday -- commences by Tuesday , former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney 's speech will probably move to that night from Wednesday .
Other changes were being contemplated Saturday afternoon .
The hardest decisions , like whether to cancel a day or two of the four - day gathering or to or condense days , will be made at the last second , GOP officials said .
But the logistics of those decisions are being discussed .
There are two scenarios under consideration for Bush 's speech , slated for Monday night .
If the president is on hand to speak , his wife , Laura , will give a short speech .
If he is not , the first lady will give a longer speech , and the president will speak via satellite .
That decision will probably not be made until Sunday evening or Monday .
Officials wo n't discuss in detail how McCain 's plans might change .
They wo n't talk about McCain in any detail , but he is likely to go Monday or Tuesday to an aid station in an area hit by the hurricane , if it continues on as expected .
Earlier Saturday , President Bush declared a state of emergency in Mississippi , following similar declarations in Louisiana and Texas .
The president ordered federal aid to supplement state and local efforts in the areas in the forecast path of Hurricane Gustav .
Bush checked in with the four governors whose states are in Gustav 's potential route .
The president pledged the full support of the federal government to those states , White House spokesman Scott Stanzel said .
Bush and his administration were heavily criticized in 2005 for not moving fast enough to send federal help to the Gulf Coast when Hurricane Katrina hit .
CNN 's Dana Bash , Ed Hornick , John King and Rebecca Sinderbrand contributed to this report .
All About John McCain • Republican Party • Hurricanes and Cyclones
Ever !
You are not even entitled to " I do n’t know . "
You are entitled to your desires , and sometimes to your choices .
You might own a choice , and if you can choose your preferences , you may have the right to do so .
But your beliefs are not about you ; beliefs are about the world .
Your beliefs should be your best available estimate of the way things are ; anything else is a lie .
If you ever feel tempted to resist an argument or conclusion by saying " everyone is entitled to their opinion , " stop !
This is as clear a bias indicator as they come .
It may irritate you to give in , but honesty demands it .
Yes , you can sometimes reasonably reject a claim that appears well supported by arguments .
After all , a reliable source might recommend against the claim , but not give its reasons .
Or the arguments might come from a biased source , good at searching selectively for arguments favoring a certain side .
But beware the temptation to use these as blanket excuses to ignore good arguments .
The idea that everyone is entitled to their opinion comes in part from our cult of democracy .
We are proud to live in a society where we all can " have our say " by talking and voting , and those who claim we do not know enough to have a useful say , we suspect are trying to disenfranchise us .
We must therefore all know enough to have a useful say on any public issue .
But that is wrong .
A related error is the idea there are two kinds of topics : facts and opinions .
On facts you can be wrong , so you just go to experts and then believe them .
On opinions no one can be wrong ; the weight of opinion is the weight of power ; those who say there are experts are trying to trick you into giving up your power .
My students do n’t expect much class discussion when I teach math or physics , but they do expect discussion on topics related to personal choice or public policy .
And they expect any opinion expressed eloquently and with passion to be worth as good a grade .
( At least non-economics students expect these things . )
Jared Diamond writes :
Anybody , scientist or no , feels entitled to spout forth on politics or psychology , and to heap scorn on what scholars in those fields write .
It is true that some topics give experts stronger mechanisms for resolving disputes .
On other topics our biases and the complexity of the world make it harder to draw strong conclusions .
And topics where most of us can contribute relevant information may be good topics for discussions , and not just lectures .
But never forget that on any question about the way things are ( or should be ) , and in any information situation , there is always a best estimate .
You are only entitled to your best honest effort to find that best estimate ; anything else is a lie .

WASHINGTON  Congress is considering a bill that would bar children who use computers in public libraries from accessing Facebook and other social networking websites without parental permission .
Rep. Mark Steven Kirk , the Illinois Republican who sponsored the measure , says the proposal would keep sexual predators from contacting minors who are using a library computer .
But the American Library Association says Kirk 's bill is yet another attempt by the federal government to interfere with library users ' privacy and free speech .
" If people in a community do not feel confident that their privacy will be protected , they cannot use the library as it was intended , for intellectual pursuit , " said Emily Sheketoff , who heads the association 's Washington office .
" It will intimidate them . "
It 's the latest in a series of battles the association has been fighting with Congress over the past decade .
Some highlights :
• In 2000 , lawmakers required libraries receiving federally discounted Internet service to install devices to filter out obscene material .
Libraries sued , but the Supreme Court upheld the law .
• A year later , following the 2001 terrorist attacks , Congress passed the USA Patriot Act , giving federal authorities more power to track the books and videos library patrons borrow and the websites they visit .
Despite objections from the American Library Association , the act was renewed in 2006 without significant changes , other than a requirement that authorities take extra steps in justifying their need for the records .
Supporters of the law note that two of the 2001 hijackers bought their plane tickets using a public computer at a New Jersey college library and that other members of the plot surfed the Internet using a computer at a public library in Delray Beach , Fla .
Earlier this year , a federal magistrate judge in Atlanta ruled the FBI did not violate the privacy of a Pakistani national in 2006 by logging onto the same computer the Pakistani has used and looking up which websites he had visited .
Agents said the man was part of a terrorism plot .
• In 2007 , the American Library Association helped persuade Congress to reopen several Environmental Protection Agency libraries the Bush administration had closed .
The closures " created a serious obstacle to the public 's ability to gather information about key environmental issues , " according to the association .
• Kirk 's bill , the Deleting Online Predators Act , died in 2006 but gained new life this year .
Kirk says that as more children flock to social networking sites like MySpace and Facebook , " we 've seen a corresponding increase of online sexual predators " targeting those children .
But library officials say the legislation — while tackling a legitimate problem — takes the wrong approach in trying to keep kids safe from online predators .
Rather than outlawing certain sites , the American Library Association supports preparing kids and parents to deal with online threats at the library , home or anywhere else .
A group of islands with the potential to develop into a tourist paradise has been named as the country least equipped to withstand the effects of climate change .
The Comoros Islands in the Indian Ocean , between Mozambique and Madagascar , are a small nation of sparkling blue lagoons and picture - postcard beaches .
But the country is politically unstable and a report published today says it is the world 's most vulnerable country to the future impacts of global warming such as increased storms , rising sea levels and agricultural failure .
At the other end of the scale , Canada is the best place to move to if you want to be a climate change survivor in the decades ahead ( although Britain is also a good place to be as a warming atmosphere takes hold ) .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The best - to - worst rankings are revealed in the first - ever climate change vulnerability index , produced by Maplecroft , a British consultancy which specialises in the mapping of risk .
Its study , The Climate Change Risk Report , looks in great detail at global warming risks in 168 countries .
Africa is the most vulnerable region , and eight of the 10 most vulnerable countries are African , with the Comoros Islands followed by Somalia and Burundi in second and third places .
Only five non-African countries are in the 20 most vulnerable .
They are Yemen , Afghanistan , Haiti , Pakistan and Nepal .
As might be expected , developed nations score best .
Canada is top , followed by Ireland , Norway , Denmark and Sweden .
The United Kingdom is in 12th position , just behind the US .
The surprise in the top 20 is Uruguay , which is listed ninth , and the only well - placed nation not to be in the club of countries which are rich , or Western ( and usually both ) .
The originality of the new study is that it does not predict global warming 's impacts , from increased droughts to rising sea levels , which has been done for the past two decades by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change .
Instead , it looks at how countries are fitted to meet them .
" We 're not saying anything about the changing climate , " said Andy Thow , one of the report 's authors .
" We 're saying , what 's the situation on the ground in terms of vulnerability ?
If there were an impact , how vulnerable would the country be ? "
Vulnerability is examined by the study across six different sectors – the economy ; natural resources and ecosystems ; poverty , development and health ; agriculture ; population , settlement and infrastructure ; and institutions , governance and social capital .
Eventually a figure is arrived at on the scale of one to 10 , with one being the most vulnerable , and 10 the most secure .
The Comoros score is 1.21 ; Canada 's score is 8.81 .
( The UK scores 8.06 . )
" The simple reason that Comoros is most vulnerable overall is that it scores poorly across all parts of the index , " Dr Thow said .
" The combination of all these factors is worse than for any other country .
It scores particularly poorly in the agriculture and natural resources and ecosystems components .
This reflects a situation in which pressure on natural resources is extremely high and there is very limited capacity to adapt to the impacts of changes in climate .
That capacity is limited by factors such as poor land quality , low crop production and yields and water stress , combined with a growing population .
" Canada , on the other hand , is extremely well equipped to adapt to changes in climate .
It scores well across all aspects of the index .
This is because of the low pressure on natural resources resulting from a low population density and large land area , combined with high agricultural capacity , a healthy economy , few development and health challenges and excellent public institutions . "
But Dr
Thow pointed out that while Maplecroft 's work showed Canada was well placed to manage the impacts of climate change on people and society , its wildlife was likely to be seriously affected by the expected magnitude of changes to climate in the Arctic region .
The Comoros also scores lowest in the world ( jointly with Chad ) on the report 's index of emissions of carbon dioxide , which means that the country likely to suffer most from global warming has done the least to cause it .
Worst hit

All things fall apart . . . well they will if we keep valuing literacy at the expense of numeracy , writes Donald Clarke
THE NEWS that more than 5,000 Leaving Cert candidates managed to fail their maths exams has , understandably enough , sent business leaders and education analysts into a frenzy of hair - tearing and teeth - gnashing .
We have a century or so to go before robots rule the planet and , in the interim , these innumerate dunderheads are going to have to build our bridges , design our trains and formulate our pharmaceuticals .
What a gruesome prospect .
The massed despair among the chatterers is , however , of a different character to that which emerges when some report declares too few children can speak Irish or recite romantic poetry .
The impending crisis for industry is worth fretting about , but one wonders why so few seem to care that a generation is being denied ( or is denying itself ) the illumination and intellectual excitement that comes with understanding mathematics .
Like the Irish language and romantic poetry , maths is , surely , worth studying for its own sake .
The pool from which media fulminators are drawn is overstocked with graduates from the humanities who , in their college days , enjoyed caricaturing science students as greasy oiks in bad duffel coats .
Now , as adults , not only are they hopelessly ill - informed about organic chemistry and contour integrals , but they seem positively proud of that over - trumpeted ignorance .
You think this an exaggeration ?
Well , think back to the conversations that surrounded the publication of Stephen Hawking 's A Brief History of Timein 1988 .
It rapidly became an axiom of the commentariat that no decent person had ever got through it .
I was hopeless at maths at school , Betty Cushy - Degree might say .
The moment I see an equation , my brain turns to feathers and cheese .
Folk who would never admit they are confused by all those long words in Shakespeare , or that history is far too complicated for their silly little heads , positively rejoice in announcing their inability to grasp the most rudimentary of scientific concepts .
Weirdly , such people seem to believe that ignorance in one field only confirms their erudition in another .
When , as a student of mathematics at Trinity College , Dublin , I joined forces with a physics boffin to form an experimental , post - Krautrock band entitled The Levi-Civita Symbol , contemporaries with no knowledge of maths labelled me a pretentious lunatic .
They were , of course , absolutely correct .
Naming your band for an important term from tensor calculus is an act of unforgivable indulgence , but nobody much minded when The Fall took their name from a novel by Albert Camus or Josef K drew on a book by Franz Kafka .
Camus and Kafka count as cultural icons , you see .
In the interests of full disclosure , I should point out I also studied English .
CP Snow , the English physicist and novelist , addressed this issue in a famous 1959 lecture entitled The Two Cultures .
He explained how he had too frequently found himself in the company of people who , after making it clear that they felt themselves supremely well - educated , would bemoan the supposed illiteracy of scientists .
Once or twice , I have been provoked and have asked the company how many of them could describe the Second Law of Thermodynamics , the law of entropy , Snow wrote .
The response was cold : it was also negative .
Yet he was asking the scientific equivalent of : " Have you read a work of Shakespeare's ? "
Snow would , surely , have despaired at the imbalance in the mainstream Irish media 's attitudes towards the nation 's most lauded writers and its greatest scientists .
Unless I am making it up , North Great George 's Street in Dublin was recently renamed JoyceWorld .
Beckett is on tea towels .
Yeats has his own lunchboxes .
Compare all this with the relative obscurity that still surrounds William Rowan Hamilton .
To celebrate the 200th anniversary of the great Irish mathematician 's birth , the State did attempt to rename 2005 " Hamilton Year " but , a few fine articles in this newspaper aside , the media paid little more attention than it did to International Sausage Day or Wear Culottes to Work Week .
We could point out that , without Hamilton 's discovery of the quaternion , the computer graphics in Grand Theft Auto IVwould be a lot harder to achieve , but such campaigns reek of condescension and a gruesome desire to Make Science Fun !
Here 's a suggestion .
Henceforth , let 's express shame rather than pride when we admit to ignorance of the Second Law of Thermodynamics or A Brief History of Time .
There 's nothing big or clever about being stupid .
Would you really prefer to drive across bridges designed by people who , though well - versed in the plays of Christopher Marlowe , somehow contrived to fail foundation - level maths in their Leaving Cert ?
I thought not .

Indiana Jones chases the secrets of the skull in the Hollywood film A Scot has spent 20 years trying to find the secrets of an ancient crystal skull , as depicted in a Hollywood film .
The latest Indiana Jones movie features the superhero searching for the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull , but Cris Winter from Fife has been searching longer .
According to mythology , the real - life Mitchell - Hedges skull , which the movie is loosely based on , is thought to hold secrets of a lost civilisation .
Cris has spent years globe trotting to unravel the cryptic mystery .
He first became interested in the skull after he had a dream about it and decided to conduct research .
Ancient skulls
The 64 - year - old tracked it down to North America and has joined a growing group of people who believe it is one of 13 ancient skulls which , when put together , will create a hologram to uncover lost worlds .
The Mitchell - Hedges skull , the only one known to be in existence , can be traced back to 1943 when it was purchased at an auction in London for £ 400 by the man whose name it now bears .
Experts have been unable to date it but some believe it is 3,500 years old .
Others have dismissed it as a fake .
You can not understand this through a rational approach
Cris Winter Cris said he became friends with the former owner of the skull , Mitchell - Hedges ' adopted daughter Anna .
He had chanced his luck at her house , in Canada , where he was welcomed inside to see the skull .
" I was just amazed at the artistic beauty of it .
The immediate thing you think when you see it is ' my god ' and it puts an enormous question mark when you look at it .
Where did it come from ?
" If nobody 's got an answer , then where did it come from and that 's the quest it sets you up on . "
Cris believes it represents a mythology which could one day lead to a lost world .
" You can not understand this through a rational approach .
You have to discard the rational mind . "
Since first encountering the skull in 1989 , Cris said he has progressed very little in understanding its meaning .
He has studied text written by Mitchell - Hedges and believes there are clues about where it may have come from .
Interest in its meaning may now increase to the levels witnessed by the Da Vinci Code mystery depicted in the Dan Brown novel .
Cris - a former businessman - has been involved in making a documentary film about the secrets of the skull which is due to be released later this year .

What are these ?

Expositions of Obamanomics have begun to appear .
In The New York Review of Books , John Cassidy asks , “ If Obama is n’t an old - school Keynesian , what is he ? ”
One answer , writes Cassidy , is a behavioralist – “ the term economists use to describe those who subscribe to the tenets of behavioral economics , an increasingly popular discipline that seeks to marry the insights of psychology to the rigor of economics . ”
Cassidy was reviewing a book , Nudge : Improving Decisions about Health , Wealth and Happiness , by Richard Thaler , of the Graduate School of Business of the University of Chicago , and Cass Sunstein , of Harvard Law School , in which the authors advocate the practice of “ choice architecture ” in the name of an overarching political doctrine they call libertarian paternalism .
The basic idea , eminently sensible though not often consensible ( meaning sufficiently persuasive to create a broad consensus ) , is for government to adopt measures to move people in directions that will make their lives better – automatic opt- in to savings plans , nutrition labels on packaged foods , disclosure requirements in financial transactions , no - call lists , airbags , and so on .
Cassidy ’s deeper purpose is to delineate what he sees as a new approach to public policy , occupying a middle ground between libertarians ( “ Friedmanites ” ) and Keynesians , “ whose intellectual jousting dominated economics for most of the twentieth century . ”
The antecedents he traces to the work of Daniel Kahnemann and Amos Tversky , who began exploring systematic cognitive biases nearly forty years ago with a view to building into economics a more realistic view of human limitations .
Present - day leaders of the behavioral movement , he says , include David Laibson and Andrei Shleifer , both of Harvard University ; Mathew Rabin , of the University of California , Berkeley ; Colin Camerer , of Caltech ; and Thaler , who for many years wrote a column ( “ Anomalies ” ) for the Journal of Economic Perspectives .
Cassidy hopes that behavioral economics will prove to be less a “ middle way ” than a vindication , “ another convincing rationale ” for the kind of Keynesian and regulatory policies that prevailed in the forty years after World War II , a period , Cassidy writes , “ not coincidentally , in which working people saw their living standards improve at an unprecedented clip . ”
It may be time to dust off the adage , attributed to one of Franklin Delano Roosevelt ’s political aides .
When asked about the economic advisers to the campaign , he pointed to his suit coat and said , before replying , “ Do you see these buttons on my sleeve ?
They do n’t do a damn thing , but fashion says I ’ve got to have them , so I do . ”
Granted , we ’ve come a long way from the first real “ brains trust ” in 1933 – the unofficial team of experts gathered to advise Roosevelt , including Adolph Berle , Rexford G. Tugwell , Raymond Moley , Felix Frankfurter , Thomas Corcoran and others , that gave currency to a term that had been used occasionally at least since 1901 .
Congress established a three - member Council of Economic Advisers to the President in 1946 .
President Eisenhower flirted briefly in 1953 with not filling the jobs when the Republican Congress threatened to withhold an appropriation .
After Council economists acted too independently in early 1980s , a layer of insulation was established within the Executive Office of the President in 1993 in the form of the National Economic Council ( first director , Robert Rubin ) .
Today you ca n’t run anything without taking economics into consideration .
Intimations of an incipient revolution in economics have been a standard prop in recent presidential campaigns .
Reagan had his supply - side economists , Mondale his strategic traders , Clinton his communitarians .
One of the most reassuring things about Obama is that Austan Goolsbee , of the Graduate S chool of Business of the University of Chicago , has been with him since his Senate campaign in 2004 .
A 1991 graduate of Yale College , Goolsbee received his PhD from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1995 and went straight to Chicago to teach MBAs .
A specialist in public finance , he has published a good deal on Internet taxation , and some recently on industrial organization .
He has been a prolific communicator of professional views as well , writing first for Slate , then as a rotating columnist for The New York Times .
Probably the single most striking paper in Goolsbee ’s portfolio is Evidence on the High - Income Laffer Curve from Six Decades of Tax Reform , published in Brookings Papers on Economic Activity in 1999 .
After the cartoon version of the Laffer Curve ( tax cuts automatically pay for themselves ) was convincingly impugned by experience – deficits exploded after the tax cuts of the 1980s and vanished after the tax increases of the 1990s — econometricians , especially Martin Feldstein and Lawrence Lindsey , devised methods to test more sophisticated versions of the proposition that high marginal tax rates had been counterproductive in the 1980s .
It was not that high earners worked less , but rather that they shifted their compensation out of taxable forms ( wages , salaries , bonuses ) and into untaxed forms of compensation , notably capital income and various lavish perks .
But Goolsbee applied these tax - responsiveness methods to six other major tax reforms since 1922 and found that “ The lowest estimates of the elasticity [ of taxable income with respect to the marginal rate ] based on the 1980s data exceed even the highest estimates from data on any previous tax change . ”
The vast majority of the changes in taxable income in the 90s had come from temporary shifts , mostly variations in the timing of option exercises , income that eventually would be subject to taxation .
In other words , Goolsbee wrote , the evidence of “ new ” literature on tax responsiveness was no more compelling than the old .
“ It seems that , for now at least , ” he concluded , “ we will have to keep paying for our tax cuts the old fashioned way ” – either by cutting expenditures , or , just possibly , dispensing with them altogether .
Moreover , Goolsbee is under no illusions that he is an expert on monetary or international economics .
He has routinely turned for advice during the campaign to David and Christina Romer , macroeconomist and economic historian , respectively , both of Berkeley ; and to David Cutler , of Harvard University , on matters of health care reform .
( An unofficial list of others is here . )
Earlier this spring , Goolsbee told Loretta Fulton , of the Abilene ( Tex . )
Reporter News ( he spent his summers at his grandparents ’ ranch in nearby View ) , that his job resembles that of a mechanic , who climbs over the wall during pit stops in a NASCAR race , tinkers with the car as needs be , then climbs back out of the way .
“ [ Obama ] ’s definitely the guy driving the 500 laps , ” Goolsbee said .
Since Keynes , the conventional wisdom has been that politicians are on the receiving end of a one - way conveyor belt of ideas from economists – from smart live ones if they are lucky , dumb dead ones if they are not .
It does n’t take a professional skeptic to recognize that this view is highly favorable to economists .
Indeed , it is probably downright misleading .
Bold politicians often take the lead in practice and economists must scramble to catch up .
For politicians , at least the best of them , possess a wisdom about how to get things done that is superior to the understanding that any economics textbook can confer .
Tax reform ordinarily has been the preserve of experts – the rare exceptions were the populist tax cuts of Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush .
But anyone who knows the history of Social Security , or Medicaid , or the Prescription Drug Benefit Act of 2003 will recognize that such programs spring from the minds of political leaders , not from their technocratic counselors , eager to lobby for the Next New Thing .
Between now and November , mainstream journalists will probe , profile , and delineate the differences between the economics advisers and the policy staffs of each campaign .
Not until the first big speech after the election will we know with any certainty how the next president intends to proceed .
But I can say right now , with considerable confidence , what the election will be about .
The questions that finally will be at the heart of the 2008 election campaign were framed up with memorable clarity and depth by health economist Victor Fuchs , in a conference that he organized at Stanford University in the wake of the health care fiasco of 1994 .
He published the results two years later as Individual and Social Responsibility : Child Care , Education , Medical Care and Long Term Care .
In his introduction , Fuchs wrote that a general , systemic failure was common to all the policies that plague the provision of such services .
It stemmed from “ our unwillingness and inability to discuss and resolve value issues that form the foundation of any society . ”
He continued ,
At the root of most of our major choices about social problems are choices about values .
What kind of people are we ?
What kind of life to we want to lead ?
What is our vision of the good society ?
How much weight do we want to give to individual freedom ?
How much to equality ?
How much to security ?
How much to material progress ?
If we emphasize only individual responsibility , we come close to recreating “ the jungle , ” with all the freedom and all the insecurity and inequality that prevails in the jungle .
On the other hand , if we ignore individual responsibility and rely entirely on social responsibility , the best we can hope for is the security of a well - run “ zoo . ”
Short - term , rapidly - shifting matters of policy aside – the business cycle , the war in Iraq – the 2008 election has been framed by Barack Obama precisely as a wide - ranging discussion of the various tensions between individual and social responsibility .
This is a man who has spent his adult life at the epicenter of a pair of powerful movements with their headquarters on the south side of Chicago , first as a community organizer for the Saul Alinsky - inspired Calumet Community Religious Conference , then as a lecturer on constitutional law at the Milton - Friedman / Aaron Director / Ronald Coase / George Stigler - inspired University of Chicago Law School .
You thought it was a big deal when the first Chicago economist took a seat on the Council of Economic Advisers ( William Niskanen in 1981 ) ?
The chances are that the United States is about to get a president from Chicago ’s Hyde Park – and learn something in the process about the difference between a liberal and a libertarian .

Covering economics from Boston is one thing .
Covering hedge fund compensation is quite another .
I received a vivid lesson in the latter last week from Felix Salmon , the peripatetic online “ Market Movers ” columnist of Portfolio magazine .
Having published the Web version of “ A Normal Professor ” last week , I went to bed worrying that , in accepting a figure bruited about the University of Chicago , I had overestimated Andrei Shleifer ’s net worth .
I woke up to a jaunty note from Salmon asking if perhaps the appropriate figure might be closer to $ 40 million in yearly income rather than total wealth .
He had performed the rough calculations of fees on assets under management that I had been reluctant to attempt myself and came up with a much bigger number .
He wrote , “ [ M ] y guess is that the Shleifer - Zimmerman family has a net worth of vastly more than $ 40 million , and quite possibly something in the billion dollar range . ”
Does that seem implausible ?
Not if you read Salomon ’s brief .

Far from it — but it is a better guesstimate than mine .
Still more persuasive appraisals will emerge in time .
Did McCain ad lift ' cross in the dirt ' story from Russian novelist ?
RAW STORY
Published : Sunday August 17 , 2008
Print This Email This Senator John McCain ( R - AZ ) , in a Christmas - themed December ad for his presidential campaign , told the following story : " One night , after being mistreated as a POW , a guard loosened the ropes binding me , easing my pain .
On Christmas , that same guard approached me , and without saying a word , he drew a cross in the sand .
We stood , wordlessly , looking at the cross , remembering the true light of Christmas .
I 'll never forget that no matter where you are , no matter how difficult the circumstances , there will always be someone who will pick you up . "
" It just sounded so fake and so contrived , so I did a little research about it , " said Daily Kos contributor rickrocket .
The research revealed a similar story by recently departed novelist and McCain favorite Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn , recounting his experience in a Soviet gulag in The Gulag Archipelago , released in the United States in 1973 .
Luke Veronis , in The Sign of the Cross , recounts : " Along with other prisoners , he worked in the fields day after day , in rain and sun , during summer and winter .
His life appeared to be nothing more than backbreaking labor and slow starvation .
The intense suffering reduced him to a state of despair .
On one particular day , the hopelessness of his situation became too much for him .
He saw no reason to continue his struggle , no reason to keep on living .
His life made no difference in the world .
So he gave up .
Leaving his shovel on the ground , he slowly walked to a crude bench and sat down .
He knew that at any moment a guard would order him to stand up , and when he failed to respond , the guard would beat him to death , probably with his own shovel .
He had seen it happen to other prisoners .
As he waited , head down , he felt a presence .
Slowly he looked up and saw a skinny old prisoner squat down beside him .
The man said nothing .
Instead , he used a stick to trace in the dirt the sign of the Cross .
The man then got back up and returned to his work .
As Solzhenitsyn stared at the Cross drawn in the dirt his entire perspective changed .
He knew he was only one man against the all - powerful Soviet empire .
Yet he knew there was something greater than the evil he saw in the prison camp , something greater than the Soviet Union .
He knew that hope for all people was represented by that simple Cross .
Through the power of the Cross , anything was possible .
Solzhenitsyn slowly rose to his feet , picked up his shovel , and went back to work .
Outwardly , nothing had changed .
Inside , he had received hope . "

* Ukraine facing unaffordable gas price hike from Jan 1
* Europe risks energy crisis without Russia - Ukraine deal
* No progress in talks as Ukrainians jockey for position
HONG KONG , July 8 ( Reuters ) - A fresh New Year energy crisis is brewing in Europe as Russia prepares to foist an indigestible price rise onto Ukraine , putting European supplies at risk , a leading expert on the sector warned on Tuesday .
Jonathan Stern , director of gas research at the Oxford Insitute of Energy Studies , said Russia ’s pledge to pay Central Asian gas suppliers “ international prices ” for gas from Jan. 1 meant a huge increase in the price Russia demands from Ukraine .
“ Essentially they ’re going to try to impose a price on Ukraine that Ukraine ca n’t pay .
And I can see that we ’re sleepwalking towards the end of the year and that price has got to be agreed , and I think we could see a replay of 2006 , ” Stern said .
“ We could have a major blow - up in January again . ”
The European Union gets about a quarter of its gas from Russia , and 80 percent of that is piped across Ukrainian territory .
In 2006 , a dispute between Ukraine and Russia 's gas monopoly Gazprom GAZP .MM led to brief supply cuts to the European Union , sparking a barrage of political complaints .
A year later a similar dispute between Russia and Belarus , which accounts for the other 20 percent of Russian transit gas , escalated to the point that the main Russian oil pipeline to Europe was closed for several days during a harsh winter .
“ We should have seen it coming in 2006 .
Now , we can definitely see this coming .
This is coming , ” Stern said .
“ If we have a bad winter , there will be uproar . ”
Russia holds sway over the region ’s gas because the pipelines taking Central Asian gas to Europe run across its territory .
The 2006 crisis was resolved when the two sides agreed to let a middleman , a private firm called RosUkrEnergo , sell Central Asian gas to Ukraine at prices well below the European average , effectively cutting Russia out of the equation .
RosUkrEnergo ’s role is due to finish at the end of this year , giving the price talks a further twist .
Russia has begun building export pipelines to bypass Ukraine and avoid similar entanglements in future , but they will not come on stream for around five years , Stern said .
BLAME GAME
He said Russia could be criticised for not making the potential crisis “ crystal clear to the rest of the world ” but by setting out its plans it had put the ball in Ukraine ’s court .
“ The Russians are in a colossally strong position .
The Ukrainians , like everyone else , heard them tell the Central Asians back in March : ‘ You ’re getting European prices from January . ’
So we all knew ... that this is disastrous for Ukraine . ”
The price rise , affecting about two - thirds of Ukraine ’s gas , could boost the price demanded from Ukraine ’s gas buyers from $ 180 to $ 400 per 1,000 cubic metres of gas .
“ It ’s not that it ’s unreasonable by European standards , it ’s just that they ca n’t pay it .
Ukraine is a gas - based economy , and they ’d have to take the most enormous hit , ” Stern said .
But Ukraine ’s top politicians have failed to grasp the nettle , with Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko and President Viktor Yushchenko already manoeuvring to contest a presidential election due at the end of 2009 or early in 2010 .
“ So this gas thing is about who can be blamed for screwing it up .
In this negotiation , she wants to seem tough with the Russians and he wants to seem like he ’s the guy who can do a deal with the Russians but she ’s screwing it up , ” Stern said .
“ All we ’ve had so far is a lot of nonsense from Tymoshenko about ‘ We need a five year transition period , we need a long - term contract . ’
No real recognition that , hello , this is it . ”
The price talks may also be frosty , since Tymoshenko will sit across the table from Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin , pitting the pin-up of Ukraine ’s 2004 pro-western “ Orange Revolution ” against its nemesis , Russia ’s president at the time .
As well as the price itself , the two need to agree a transit tariff and a storage tariff , as well as a more workable duration than the annual round of talks leading to a midwinter crisis .
“ By the time we get to September , we all get back from our holidays , including them , we ’ve got three months - and that ’s not long to look at completely revisiting an agreement with a doubling of prices . ”
Stern , who was in Hong Kong to launch a book entitled “ Natural Gas in Asia ” , said one reason that Russia had offered to pay more to Central Asia producers was to lure them away from exporting to China and to Europe via the Iran - Turkey route .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Undiagnosed infections may be causing a significant number of premature births , researchers reported on Monday after finding bacteria or fungi in 15 percent of the amniotic fluid samples taken from women in pre-term labor .
The heavier the infection , the more likely the women were to deliver younger , sicker infants , the team at Stanford University in California found .
“ If we could prevent these infections in the first place , or detect them sooner , we might one day be able to prevent some of these premature births , ” Dr. Dan DiGiulio , who worked on the study , said in a statement .
More and more children are being born prematurely in the United States , with 12 percent of births coming before the 37th week of gestation .
Premature babies are vulnerable to breathing problems , underdeveloped organs , infections and cerebral palsy .
DiGiulio ’s team looked for the DNA of germs in amniotic fluid samples collected from 166 women in pre-term labor at the Detroit Medical Center between October 1998 and December 2002 .
They used this method and standard laboratory cultures to determine that 25 of the 166 samples were infected with either bacteria or fungi .
They also found at least one unknown organism that could be a new species .
All 25 of the women with infected amniotic fluid went on to deliver their babies pre-term , while 53 of the women with no infections were able to stop their labor .
Now the team is working to see if infections can be detected before pre-term labor starts , which could lead to new prevention or treatment approaches .

3. Blaster
The Blaster Worm ( also known as Lovsan or Lovesan ) was a computer worm that spread on computers running the Microsoft operating systems , Windows XP and Windows 2000 .
The worm was first noticed and started spreading on August 11 , 2003 .
The rate that it spread increased until the number of infections peaked on August 13 , 2003 .
Filtering by ISPs and widespread publicity about the worm curbed the spread of Blaster .
The worm was programmed to start a SYN flood on August 15 , 2003 against port 80 of windowsupdate.com , thereby creating a distributed denial of service attack ( DDoS ) against the site .
The damage to Microsoft was minimal as the site targeted was windowsupdate.com instead of windowsupdate.microsoft.com to which it was redirected .
Microsoft temporarily shut down the targeted site to minimize potential effects from the worm .
Although the worm can only spread on systems running Windows 2000 or Windows XP ( 32 bit ) it can cause instability in the RPC service on systems running Windows NT , Windows XP ( 64 bit ) , and Windows Server 2003 .
If the worm detects a connection to the Internet ( regardless of dial - up or broadband ) , this can even lead to the system becoming so unstable that it displays the following message and then restarts ( usually after 60 seconds ) .
The worm contains two messages hidden in strings .
The first :
I just want to say LOVE YOU SAN !!
This is why the worm is sometimes called the Lovesan worm .
The second :
billy gates why do you make this possible ?
Stop making money
and fix your software !!
It is a message to Bill Gates , Microsoft co-founder .
Sobig Worm
Code Red
CIH
Klez
Melissa
Sasser
Bagle
Win32 / Simile
Nimda
4. The Sobig Worm was a computer worm that infected millions of Internet - connected , Microsoft Windows computers in August 2003 .
It was written using the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler , and subsequently compressed using a data compression program called tElock .
There are plenty of variants of the Sobig worm , but the most destructive and widespread of all is called Sobig .
F.Sobig is a computer worm in the sense that it replicates by itself , but also a Trojan horse in that it masquerades as something other than malware .
The Sobig worm will appear as an electronic mail and will contain the text : " See the attached file for details " or " Please see the attached file for details . " .
The Sobig . F worm deactivated itself on September 10 , 2003 .
On November 5 the same year , Microsoft announced that they will pay $ 250,000 for information leading to the arrest of the creator of the Sobig worm .
To date , the perpetrator has not been caught .
5 . The Code Red worm was a computer worm observed on the Internet on July 13 , 2001 .
It attacked computers running Microsoft 's IIS web server .
The most in - depth research on the worm was performed by the programmers at eEye Digital Security .
They also gave the worm the phrase " Hacked By Chinese ! " with which the worm defaced websites .
Although the worm had been released on July 13 , the largest group of infected computers was seen on July 19 , 2001 .
On this day , the number of infected hosts reached 359,000 .
Effects of Code Red :*
It defaced the affected web site to display : HELLO !
Welcome to http://www.worm.com!
Hacked By Chinese !( The last sentence became a cliché to indicate an online defeat ) *
It tried to spread itself by looking for more IIS servers on the Internet . *
It waited 20 - 27 days after it was installed to launch denial of service attacks on several fixed IP addresses .
The IP address of the White House web server was among those .
eEye believed that the worm originated in Makati City , Philippines ( the same origin as the VBS / Loveletter ( aka " ILOVEYOU " ) worm ) 6.CIH , also known as Chernobyl or Spacefiller , is a computer virus written by Chen Ing Hau of Taiwan .
It is considered to be one of the most harmful widely circulated viruses , overwriting critical information on infected system drives , and more importantly , in some cases corrupting the system BIOS .
The name " Chernobyl Virus " was coined some time after the virus was already well - known as CIH , and refers to the complete coincidence of the payload trigger date in some variants of the virus ( actually the virus writer 's birthday ) and the Chernobyl accident , which happened in Ukraine on April 26 , 1986 .
Today , CIH is not as widespread as it once was , due to awareness of the threat and the fact it only affects older Windows 9x ( 95 , 98 , Me ) operating systems .
The virus made another comeback in 2001 when a variant of the Loveletter Worm in a VBS file that contained a dropper routine for the CIH virus was circulated around the internet , under the guise of a nude picture of Jennifer Lopez .
7. Klez is a computer worm that propagates via e-mail .
It first appeared in the end of 2001 .
A number of variants of the worm exist .
Klez infects Microsoft Windows systems , exploiting vulnerability in Internet Explorer 's Trident layout engine , used by both Microsoft Outlook and Outlook Express to render HTML mail .
The e-mail through which the worm spreads always includes a text portion and one or more attachments .
The text portion consists of either an HTML internal frame tag which causes buggy e-mail clients to automatically execute the worm , or a few lines of text that attempt to induce the recipient to execute the worm by opening the attachment ( sometimes by claiming that the attachment is a patch from Microsoft ; sometimes by claiming that the attachment is an antidote for the Klez worm ) .
The first attachment is always the worm , whose internals vary .
Later variants of the worm would use a false “ From ” address , picking an e-mail address at random from the infected machine 's Outlook or Outlook Express address book , making it impossible for casual observers to determine which machine is infected , and making it difficult for experts to determine anything more than the infected machine 's Internet Service Provider .
8.
The Melissa worm , also known as " Mailissa " , " Simpsons " , " Kwyjibo " , or " Kwejeebo " , is a mass - mailing macro virus , hence leading some to classify it as a computer worm .
First found on March 26 , 1999 , Melissa shut down Internet mail systems that got clogged with infected e-mails propagating from the worm .
Melissa was not originally designed for harm , but it overflowed servers and caused unplanned problems .
Melissa can spread on word processors Microsoft Word 97 and Word 2000 .
It can mass - mail itself from e-mail client Microsoft Outlook 97 or Outlook 98 .
The worm does not work on any other versions of Word , including Word 95 , Microsoft Office Word 2003 , Word 2004 ( Mac ) , and Microsoft Office Word 2007 , nor can it mass - mail itself via any other e-mail client , even Outlook Express or Windows Mail ( Outlook Express version in Windows Vista ) .
Melissa was first distributed in the Usenet discussion group alt.sex .
The virus was inside a file called " List. DOC " , which contained passwords that allow access into 80 pornographic websites .
The worm 's original form was sent via e-mail to many people .
9 . Sasser ( sometimes known as the Big One ) is a computer worm that affects computers running vulnerable versions of the Microsoft operating systems Windows XP and Windows 2000 .
Some machines running Windows 98 were infected .
Like other worms , Sasser spreads by exploiting the system through a vulnerable network port .
Thus it is particularly potent in that it can spread without user intervention , but it is also easily stopped by a properly configured firewall or by downloading system updates from Windows Update .
Sasser was first noticed and started spreading on April 30 , 2004 .
This worm was named Sasser because it spreads by exploiting a buffer overflow in the component known as LSASS ( Local Security Authority Subsystem Service ) on the affected operating systems .
The effects of Sasser include the news agency Agence France - Presse ( AFP ) having all its satellite communications blocked for hours and the U.S. flight company Delta Air Lines having to cancel several trans- atlantic flights because its computer systems had been swamped by the worm .
The Nordic insurance company If and their Finnish owners Sampo Bank came to a complete halt and had to close their 130 offices in Finland .
The British Coastguard had its electronic mapping service disabled for a few hours , and Goldman Sachs , Deutsche Post , and the European Commission also all had issues with the worm .
The X - ray department at Lund University Hospital had all their four layer X - ray machines disabled for several hours and had to redirect emergency X - ray patients to a nearby hospital .
Sasser was at first believed to have been authored in Russia by the same person(s ) who created another worm usually referred to as Lovsan , MSBlast or Blaster ( due to the media ) , a connection indicated by code similarities between the two , but on May 7 , 2004 , 18 - year old German computer science student Sven Jaschan from Rotenburg , Lower Saxony was arrested for writing the worm .
10 .
Bagle ( also known as Beagle ) is a mass - mailing computer worm written in pure assembly and affecting all versions of Microsoft Windows .
The first strain , Bagle . A , did not propagate widely .
A second variation , Bagle .
B is considerably more virulent .
Bagle uses its own SMTP engine to mass - mail itself as an attachment to recipients gathered from the victim computer .
The second strain , Bagle .B , was first sighted on February 17 , 2004 .
It was much more widespread and appeared in large quantities ; Network Associates rated it a " medium " threat .
It is designed to stop spreading after February 25 , 2004 .
Subsequent variants have later been discovered .
Although they have not all been successful , a number remain notable threats .
Since 2004 , the threat risk from these variants has been changed to " low " due to decreased prevalence .
11 . Win32 / Simile ( also known as Etap ) is a metamorphic computer virus written in assembly language for Microsoft Windows .
The virus was released in the most recent version in early March 2002 .
It was written by the virus writer Mental Driller .
Some of his previous viruses , such as Win95 / Drill ( which used the Tuareg polymorphic engine ) , have proved very challenging to detect .
When the virus is first executed , it checks the current date .
If the host file ( the file that is infected with the virus ) imports the file User32.dll , then on the 17th of March , June , September , or December , a message is displayed .
Depending on the version of the virus the case of each letter in the text is altered randomly .
On May 14 ( the anniversary of Israeli Independence Day ) , a message saying " Free Palestine ! " will be displayed if the system locale is set to Hebrew .
The virus then rebuilds itself .
This metamorphic process is very complex and accounts for around 90 % of the virus ' code .
After the rebuild , the virus searches for executable files in folders on all fixed and remote drives .
Files will not be infected if they are located in a subfolder more than three levels deep , or if the folder name begins with the letter W .
For each file that is found , there is a 50 percent chance that it will be ignored .
Files will not be infected if they begin with F , PA , SC , DR , NO , or if the letter V appears anywhere in the file name .
Due to the way in which the name matching is done , file names that contain certain other characters are also not infected , although this part is not deliberate .
The virus contains checks to avoid infecting " goat " or " bait " files ( files that are created by anti-virus programs ) .
The infection process uses the structure of the host , as well as random factors , to control the placement of the virus body and the decryptor .
12 . Nimda is a computer worm , isolated in September 2001 .
It is also a file infector .
It quickly spread , eclipsing the economic damage caused by past outbreaks such as Code Red .
Multiple propagation vectors allowed Nimda to become the Internet ’s most widespread virus / worm within 22 minutes .
Due to the release date , some media quickly began speculating a link between the virus and Al Qaeda , though this relationship ended up being untrue .
Nimda affected both user workstations ( clients ) running Windows 95 , 98 , Me , NT , or 2000 and servers running Windows NT and 2000 .
The worm 's name spelled backwards is " admin " .
Nimda was so effective partially because it — unlike other famous malware like the Morris worm or Code Red—uses five different infection vectors : - via email - via open network shares - via browsing of compromised web sites - exploitation of various Microsoft IIS 4.0 / 5.0 directory traversal vulnerabilities .
( Both Code Red , and Nimda were hugely successful exploiting well known and long solved vulnerabilities in the Microsoft IIS server . ) - via back doors left behind by the " Code Red II " and " sadmind / IIS " worms .
The author of Nimda is suspected to be a former student who attended Sacramento State University Fall of 2001 .

Not all Cake Wrecks are a result of poor construction , as you can see from this example .
Some cake artists just seem to forget that , at the end of the day , their creation is meant to be eaten .
Can you seriously imagine being told to slice up and serve this cake ?
And baby shower cakes seem to be the worst offenders in this vein .
People , try to think outside the box , will you ?
Just because the occasion has " baby " in the name does n't mean the cake has to BE a baby , mmkay ?
You do n't see bridal shower cakes made to look like the bride , do you ?
Oh , wait - scratch that example ... But getting back to this cake - I think the worst part is that the baby is staring at me .
No , really - check out the right eye . [ shudder ]
Dang , that would be spine - tingling even if it were ababy , you know ? ()
Call me finicky , but I really can't eat anything that looks like its looking at me .
Still not creeped out ?
Then watch the video of this cake 's construction .
The final few seconds are the stuff horror flicks are made of ( " The eye !
It 's opening ! ) .
Uefa is happy with the progress being made in Poland to get the country ready for Euro 2012 but are very concerned about Ukraine .
That is the message coming from the headquarters of European football following the visit of an inspection delegation led by Uefa president Michel Platini and including executive members Geoff Thompson , former FA chairman , to these two countries .
William Galliard , Uefa 's director of communications , told me : " We are very pleased to see the effort being made in Poland .
Poland has got a good management team together and they are preparing six stadiums .
Poland should be fine .
The prime minister ( Donald Tusk ) told us Poland is determined to succeed .
" In the Ukraine , things are fuzzier .
We got a lot of promises but we shall have to see concrete progress on stadiums " .
Privately , Uefa sources tell me that they are very concerned about the state of play in Ukraine and are finding it difficult to match promises with reality .
During the visit Uefa officials met with the President of Ukraine , Vicktor Yushchenko , who told them that he would be prepared to spend five million Euros in building 4,500 kilometres of motorways .
But that is the entire length of the French motorway , which took more than 50 years to complete .
For Ukraine to promise to undertake such a gigantic construction exercise in four years seems physically impossible .
Despite Uefa 's unhappiness with the Ukraine , and fears that unrealistic promises are being made , it does not mean that come September , when the executive is due to meet , a decision will be made to take the championships away from Ukraine .
One Uefa source said : " We can not just do that .
We have to wait and see how they get on . "
However , following the visit the Polish media is already speculating that if the Ukraine cannot get its act together then the Poles would be prepared to take the burden of hosting the championships on their own .
This is in marked contrast to when the two countries won the bid , defeating Italy in the process .
Then it was Ukraine that seemed more enthusiastic with Poland a shade more reluctant .
Ukraine has made progress on two stadiums : in Donetsk and Dnipropetrovsk but they were the result of private initiatives .
Even here the major problem of infrastructure such as road and rail links need to be solved .
One solution could be for Poland to host much of the Championship , with the Ukraine getting a couple of matches in stadiums that are ready .
One exception to this will be Kiev , where there are major problems with the stadium .
Any decision to take the Championship away from Ukraine , or downgrade the country by not playing in its capital city , will be a major one , involving delicate political balancing acts within the Uefa executive .
So while hosting Euro 2012 will continue to be a headache for Platini and his executive , the end result , probably not likely until next year , may be more of a compromise rather than showing Ukraine a red card .
Look , they were just trying to help out a fellow American who had run out of gas due to the inaction of the do - nothing Democrat congress and Barak Obama 's risky schemes to tax the middle class and force whitey to take the bus .
The McCain motorhome was gently pushing the van to an American - owned , Offshore - sourced gas station , and had even offered to pay the tax , when an obviously liquored - up Obama supporter came up and tried to fist - bump Leiberman ( no relation ) in the terrorist manner , causing Indy to swerve so as to avoid pushing the family in the van to the left , and then he hit them .
See , it 's a simple explanation .
Palestinian negotiator considers binational state
By Ali Sawafta
RAMALLAH , West Bank ( Reuters ) - A top negotiator said on Sunday Palestinians may demand to become part of a binational state with Israel , if the Jewish state continued to reject the borders they propose for a separate country .
Ahmed Qurie , who heads Palestinian negotiators in U.S. - brokered talks with Israel , told Fatah party loyalists behind closed doors that a two - state solution could be achieved only if Israel met their demands to withdraw from all occupied land .
" The Palestinian leadership has been working on establishing a Palestinian state within the ' 67 borders , " Qurie said , referring to land in the West Bank and Gaza Strip that Israel captured in a 1967 war , which Palestinians seek for a state .
" If Israel continues to oppose making this a reality , then the Palestinian demand for the Palestinian people and its leadership ( would be ) one state , a binational state , " he added at the meeting held in the West Bank town of Ramallah .
His comments were carried in a statement issued after the meeting .
Israel objects to the idea of forging a joint state , and says absorbing millions of Palestinians could undermine its future as a majority Jewish country .
The chances of achieving Washington 's goal of a peace deal before President George W. Bush leaves office next year have dimmed since a scandal - struck Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert announced last month he planned to resign in the coming weeks .
Despite the Israeli political crisis , Olmert , who has vowed to pursue peace efforts until he leaves office , met with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas last week .
The two are said to be planning additional talks later this month .
But months of discussions have produced little visible progress on key issues of the conflict such as who would control Jerusalem , a city both Israel and the Palestinians want for a capital , and the future for millions of Palestinian refugees .
Abbas has also had his authority undermined by the loss of Gaza to Hamas Islamists in a bloody fight last year .
A Palestinian official said Qurie told Sunday 's gathering he thought the peace talks had hit an impasse .
The unsuccessful efforts to realize the goal of a separate state has touched off debate among Palestinians for months , including as to whether they should seek instead to merge into a joint state with Israel .

Plunger Pumps
Annovi Reverberi ( AR ) plunger pumps are a combination of exceptional degree of technology and innovation , quality and reliability worthy of a leading brand on the market .
Over 200 models are avaialble which vary in terms of pressure , deliver , power and technical characteristics , to satisfy widely different market demands .
Let us show you why AR is “ The First Choice When Quality Matters . ”
The BusinessWeek story cited below , along with King Abdullah ’s April announcement that they will not be opening new fields , provides evidence that we are near — or perhaps even at — Peak Oil .
It may be political peaking ; : perhaps the Saudi ’s could invest to increase production , but choose not to ( an obviously sensible decision ) .
It may be geological peaking , if the Saudi ’s are unable to increase production .
But whether geological or political peaking , the long - discussed event may be starting now .
Since America prefers to base its energy policy on inspired guesses , nobody has modeled the possible outcomes .
A few million dollars for a multi-disciplinary team to gather and analyze data would have better prepared us for this moment .
So we have no plans ( hope is not a plan ) .
We have no foundation of comprehensive data and research on which to make plans .
We can only speculate at what happens next .
If we are near or at peak oil , the next decade or so probably will not be pretty ( that means painful , but not the end of civilization ) .
We can take solace in the knowledge that through our fecklessness we have earned what we are about to receive .
Sooner or later , everyone sits down to a banquet of consequences .
Robert Louis Stevenson , perhaps apocryphal
“ Saudi Oil : A Crude Awakening on Supply ? “ , BusinessWeek , 10 July 2008 — “ The Saudis say they can ramp up production to 12.5 million barrels a day .
But a field - by - field breakdown obtained by Business Week shows that ’s not likely “ This may be great investigative work ; it may be a semi-official leak .
Excerpt :
However , it appears that for at least the next five years , and possibly longer , the Saudis are likely to produce less crude than promised , according to fresh data on the kingdom ’s oil fields obtained July 9 by BusinessWeek .
Saudi officials have said they would increase production capacity to 12.5 million barrels a day next year , from the current 10 million barrels a day , and could even ramp up to as much as 15 million barrels a day if the market demanded it .
… But the detailed document , obtained from a person with access to Saudi oil officials , suggests that Saudi Aramco will be limited to sustained production of just 12 million barrels a day in 2010 , and will be able to maintain that volume only for short , temporary periods such as emergencies .
Then it will scale back to a sustainable production level of about 10.4 million barrels a day , according to the data .
BusinessWeek obtained a field - by - field breakdown of estimated Saudi oil production from 2009 through 2013 .
It was provided by an oil industry executive who said he had confirmed it with a ranking Saudi energy official who has access to the field data .
The executive , who has proven reliable over several years of reporting interaction , provided the data on condition of anonymity to protect his access to the kingdom and the identity of the inside contact who confirmed the information .

Before the dawn of MP3 players or even the format itself , there was the Sony CDP - 101 and TPS - L2 , which some of you may still remember purchasing .

World ’s First Compact Disc Player
Sony ’s CDP - 101 , introduced in 1982 at the price of $ 900 , is the world ’s first compact disc audio player .
Unlike previous audio playback devices , this player digitally reconstructed sound from strings of binary code .
World ’s First Portable Cassette Player
Sony ’s compact — at the time — TPS - L2 was the world ’s first portable cassette player , forever changing how people listened to music .
This device hit Japan in 1979 , priced at a hefty $ 288 .
It featured a “ hotline ” button , which allowed users to talk over the music via built - in microphone — overriding the cassette sound , stereo playback , and dual headphone jacks .
Moral panic , censorship and popular music go a long way back .
From the spectre of Teddy Boys rampaging through British cinemas to the strains of Bill Haley and Blackboard Jungle , Elvis being filmed from " the waist up " on the Ed Sullivan Show and the Stones singing Let 's Spend Some Time Together , through to the " filth and the fury " of the Pistols ' Bill Grundy encounter , the Beastie Boys , Acid House , So Solid Crew , Amy Winehouse and on and on and on .
To that list , we must now – apparently - add the name of Pete Doherty .
Today it was announced that the Babyshambles frontman has been banned by Wiltshire Police from headlining the Moonfest festival in Westbury .
The reason ?
Preventing crime and disorder .
According to police superintendent Paul Williams , Doherty has the ability to " gee up " his audience to a dangerous frenzy ; creating a " whirlpool effect " through sheer power of musicianship and capable of sparking serious public disorder among his followers .
Slipping into Mary Whitehouse mode , he adds : " Experts are telling us that the profile of fans that follow Pete Doherty and Babyshambles is volatile and they can easily be whipped up into a frenzy , whereas the profile of someone that would follow around Cliff Richard or Bucks Fizz , for example , is completely different . "
Doherty 's unwholesome powers can be judged in all their glory here .
Admittedly , this is boisterous behaviour for a such a prestigious venue as the Albert Hall ; although , possibly , not as quite as frenzied as this , and certainly a long way short of this .
However , whatever your views on Doherty , there are serious implications here for the wider music community .
Not least as to how the Wiltshire constabulary , utilising section 160 of the 2003 Licensing Act , can wield such unreasonable and disproportionate powers in deciding what kind of musicians can and can not play live in their immediate vicinity .
Certainly , the limits of section 160 , which allows premises to be closed down if there is nothing more than a perceived risk of " disorder or expected disorder " , arose on a number of occasions in my previous capacity as chairman of the Live Music Forum .
Under terms of the Act , a local authority and constabulary has 28 days in which to undertake all checks .
Only after these are agreed is a performance licence granted – although this is the first time that it has been used to actually censor an artist .
According to the Moonfest organisers , Wiltshire police , having attended every public licensing meeting over the last six months , were fully aware that Babyshambles would be appearing , and actively supported the event when a licence was granted without objection on July 24 .
This is all verified on the district council 's website .
Clearly , in the interim period , Wiltshire police had a sudden change of mind , deciding that Babyshambles fans were , in fact , a risk to public order .
I am now in the process of writing to culture secretary Andy Burnham and look forward to hearing back as to what these extraordinary circumstances were .
No doubt UK musicians would also appreciate clarification as to where the line of censorship is drawn .
As someone who oversaw the implementation of the Act , I can confirm that it was actually designed to modernise an archaic system of licensing , not to enable faceless bureaucrats ride roughshod over culture and creativity and have undue influence over an artist 's ability to forge a career - regardless of their whirlpool inciting powers or not .
If there 's one thing I learned repeatedly while growing up it's that a dog can and will bite your genitals if you have a piece of bacon in your pocket .
So how 's a boy supposed to get his daily bacon quota without rocking a pork pocket ?
Simply -- with a bacon scarf .
Each is made from 100 % recycled bottle fleece and costs $ 38 ( plus $ 7 shipping ) .
You know , I may get one closer to winter , but it 's just now getting warm out so I can't think about scarves right now .
But what I can think about are summer dresses .
You catch my drift guys ?.

You do know what I 'm saying , right ?
Good , now tell me if I should wear my black flats or brown leather pumps with this one .

President Bush leaves the highest ever record budget deficit in the history that has reached $ 482 billion , according to the latest budget report .
White House administration said that the reason for the worsening situation is slowing economy and a $ 150 - billion bipartisan stimulus package , while Democrats mention Bush 's tax cuts and fiscal management during his presidency .
Jim Nussle , director of the Office of Management and Budget , explained that " near - term deficits are both temporary and manageable if , and only if , we keep spending in check , the tax burden low and the economy growing . "
"
He added that the according to the report the percentage of the US economic output is around 3.3 % of the gross domestic product .
The deficit for fiscal 2008 , at $ 389 billion is a bit less than it was expected .
Nussle said that the deficit is under control and OMB has a plan to cope with it .
The gross domestic product for US is estimated to increase by 1,6 % in 2008 , which is lower than in February 's projection and is explained by the growing prices for oil and other supplies , turmoil in US credit markets and worsening situation with the housing market .
Democrats attributed the budget deficit to the president 's big tax cuts freewheeling spending .
" " If we gave Olympic medals for fiscal irresponsibility , President Bush would take the gold , the silver and the bronze , because he's got the three highest record deficits ever , " " said Sen. Kent Conrad ( D - S.D. ) , chairman of the Senate Budget Committee .
" " He sets records in every single category : 2009 would be the gold ; 2004 the silver ; 2008 the bronze . "
Rep. John M. Spratt Jr. said that Bush entered the presidency with the biggest budget surplus , now leaving with the biggest deficit .
Nussle sided with the president , saying that the necessity to address national security after the terrorists attack on Sept. 11 led to the deficit .
Conrad opposed that the president ignored the problems of taxes cuts and said that Bush spent too much on the Iraq war off the regular budget .

WASHINGTON — People interested in what their ancestors did in wartime are getting a free look , until the end of the month , at a vast collection of military records online .
The National Archives and Ancestry.com have worked out an agreement to speed the transfer of millions more historical records to the Web and make an existing military collection free for people to see during a Memorial Day commemoration from today through May 31 .
Highlights of the agreement being announced today at the archives in Washington :
• Military records containing information on approximately 100 million people can be accessed at www.ancestry.com/military.
After May 31 , a paid subscription will be required to see them .
• Ancestry.com . has been buying microfilmed copies of the records from the National Archives for several years , putting the documents in digital form and allowing its members to access them online .
The documents cover almost every conflict and include draft registration cards from both world wars , images of headstones of Civil War soldiers and Vietnam prisoner of war records , among many other papers .
• The agreement hastens online access to historical records by placing Ancestry.com .
technicians in the archives to scan and digitize content .
Specifically , the website will be scanning immigration records and death notices of overseas Americans .
These records will be available on the site in 2009 , said Ancestry.com .
spokesman Mike Ward .
• The website will give digital copies to the archives , but the agreement requires the government recordkeeper to wait five years before putting the material on its own online database , said James Hastings , director of access programs at the archives .
• The National Archives keeps hold of military documents in the public domain , and people can see them for free in person .
But many records can be accessed only at research rooms of the archives , often just on microfilm , Hastings said .

As feared , violence broke out in Kerbala during a pilgrimage to a Shi’ite shrine .
Local police have ordered the hundreds of thousands already gathered to leave the city and officially ended observances .
Overall , at least 148 Iraqis were killed and 330 were wounded in incidents throughout the country .
No foreign military deaths were reported , but a private security contractor from Belfast died from a landmine explosion in Alcoot on Sunday .
Also , the The UN Refugee Agency ( UNHCR ) reported that the humanitarian crisis is getting worse .
Violence broke out in Kerbala leaving at least 51 dead and 247 wounded in what may be a battle between two Shi’ite militant groups for control of the territory .
The fighting apparently erupted when police , who are loyal to the Badr organization , began to beat pilgrims who were chanting pro-Sadr slogans ; police said that gunmen had tried to take over the area .
Pilgrims are being told to leave , and the city is now under curfew .
Originally , it was believed that Sunni militants would try to disrupt the Shi’ite festival which marks the birth of an important historical imam .
Several other incidents occurred in and around Kerbala .
Two men and two women were killed during a melee last night .
Snipers killed a boy and wounded his father as they were driving home .
Two people were killed on a minibus heading to Baghdad .
Also , the number of casualties in yesterday ’s clashes rose to seven dead and 35 wounded , up by four dead and 22 wounded .
U.S. and Iraqi forces killed 33 gunmen who were disrupting an irrigation canal servicing Khalis .
Four Iraqi soldiers were killed during a blast in town .
In Baghdad , 13 unidentified bodies were dumped in separate locations .
A kidnapped deputy oil minister was released along with several other people who were also abducted .
Snipers wounded four pilgrims in al - Bo’etha .
A car bomb in Sheikh Omar killed one person and wounded three others .
The Iraqi army reported killing 14 gunmen and detaining 21 others .
Gunmen broke into a mosque , killing three men and kidnapping three more .
Gunmen burned the Khadimiya office of the Shiite Supreme Iraqi Islamic Council ( SIIC ) and kidnapped four men ; at the Habibiyah office , five people were killed and 20 wounded .
The Amil , Sadr City and Shula offices were also attacked .
A Kirkuk policeman and his wife were shot and wounded in their car .
Two policemen and a civilian were wounded in a separate incident .
A roadside bomb in Baquba wounded 14 people on a bus .
Gunmen wounded six pilgrims in Mahmudiya .
In Albu Ajeel , gunmen killed a police lieutenant colonel .
One pilgrim was killed and three wounded during an armed attack in Iskandariya .
Gunmen wounded two pilgrims in Mahaweel .
Last night in Mussayab , a policeman was killed and his brother wounded .
Coalition forces killed eight suspects and detained 11 in central and northern Iraq .
At the Iranian border near Bachwin , a policeman was wounded as PJAK rebels ( Kurdistan Free Life Party ) clashed with local policemen .
The PJAK , who are linked to Iraq ’s PKK party , were asked to leave the area in order to encourage Iran to stop shelling northern Iraq .
Two gunmen were killed during a raid in Daquoq .
The Shiite Supreme Iraqi Islamic Council ( SIIC ) in Husseiniyah was attacked but casualties were not reported .
Gunmen injured a man in Hawija .
Violence between the SIIC and Mahdi Army also broke out in Kut .
In Diwaniya , an SIIC office was also attacked .

Creating a basic API with Django
11 August 2008 — Creating a simple public API for your site is a lot easier than you may think with Django .
You ’re basically just creating another view and serving it as XML or JSON instead of HTML .
What ’s public ?
Decide what you want to be public .
The best answer is the stuff you ’re already displaying in your HTML templates .
Then you need to create an entry in your url conf .
url ( r ' ^api/v1/(?
P<username >[- \w ] + ) /notes /?$ ' , ' readernaut.api.views.user_notes ' ) ,
Create the view
In the case for Readernaut I wanted to provide an XML feed for users notes .
Here is what the view looks like :
def user_notes ( request , username ) : reader = get_object_or_404( User , username__iexact=username ) note_list = Note.objects.filter(user=reader ) context = { ' reader ' : reader , ' note_list ' : note_list } return render_to_response('api/note_list.html ' , context , context_instance=RequestContext( request ) , mimetype='application/xml ' )
This is a simplified version of the view but , as you can see , you could easily add pagination and other hooks to handle ordering and such .
Create the template
The view is pointing to the template api / note_list .
html so all we need to do is create that file and build out our XML schema .
<?xml version = " 1.0 " encoding = " utf - 8 " ?> < notes version = " 1.0 " > { % for note in note_list %} < note > < note_id >{ { note.id }}</note_id> < user > < username >{{ note.user }}</username > < /user > < book_edtion > < title >{{ note.book_edition }}</title > < isbn >{{ note.book_edition.isbn }}</isbn> </book_edtion > < body class = " inner " > < header > < h1 > < a href= " / " > Nathan Borror</a></h1 > </ header ><![ CDATA [{{ note.note }} ] ]></body > < page_reference >{{ note.page_reference }}</page_reference > < created >{{ note.created |date : " Y - m-d G:i T " }}</created > < modified >{{ note.modified|date : " Y - m-d G:i T " }}</modified > </ note > { % endfor %} </ notes >
Surprisingly , studies have shown that having plants in the office environment — as simple as it sounds — can significantly increase employee performance and your overall profits .
Not only that … having plants in your office can also increase your “ kerb appeal ” by making your office appear more prestigious and valued .
Last year , Robert Scoble and Darren Barefoot debuted the Social Media Starfish to visualize and document the rapidly evolving landscape for social tools , services , and networks .
If you work in marketing , public relations , advertising , customer service , product development , or any discipline that ’s motivated , shaped , and directed by customers , peers , stakeholders and influencers , monitoring and in some cases , participating in online conversations is critical in competing for the future .
Over the last month , I worked with Jesse Thomas of JESS3 , to create a new graphic that helps chart online conversations between the people that populate communities as well as the networks that connect the Social Web .
The Conversation Prism is free to use and share .
It ’s our contribution to a new era of media education and literacy .
The Conversation Prism
The conversation map is a living , breathing representation of Social Media and will evolve as services and conversation channels emerge , fuse , and dissipate .
If a conversation takes place online and you ’re not there to hear or see it , did it actually happen ?
Indeed .
Conversations are taking place with or without you and this map will help you visualize the potential extent and pervasiveness of the online conversations that can impact and influence your business and brand .
As a communications or service professional , you ’ll find yourself at the center of the prism – whether you ’re observing , listening or participating .
This visual map is the ideal complement to The Essential Guide to Social Media and the Social Media Manifesto , which will help you better understand how to listen and in turn , participate transparently , sincerely , and effectively .
As conversations are increasingly distributed , everything begins with listening and observing .
Doing so , will help you identify exactly where relevant discussions are taking place , as well as their scale and frequency .
This dialog can be charted into a targeted social map that ’s unique to your brand .
In the example below , I created a Social Map using MindJet to represent the communities where I either need to or currently contribute based on my initial research .
Perhaps most importantly , the process of listening and observing will reveal the cultures of the very communities you may wish to engage .
Remember , participating in Social Media is more meaningful when you have a deeper understanding of anthropology and sociology and not just the social tools that facilitate interaction .
This is about creating and cultivating relationships with people , online and in the real world , and these relationships are defined by mutual value and benefits .
In the social economy , relationships are the new currency .
Enjoy the Conversation Prism and please let me know how you ’d like to see it evolve .

This tokenizer is split into two parts ; one language - specific parser that turns the source program into a stream of literals , names , and operators , and a second part that turns those into a token instances .
The latter checks both operators and names against the symbol table ( to handle keyword operators ) , and uses a psuedo - symbol ( “ ( name ) ” ) for all other names .
You could combine the two tasks into a single function , but the separation makes it a bit easier to test the parser , and also makes it possible to reuse the second part for other syntaxes .
We can test the new tokenizer with the old parser definition :
>>> parse ( " 1+2 " ) (+ ( literal 1 ) ( literal 2 ) ) >>> parse ( 1+2+3 " ) (+ (+ ( literal 1 ) ( literal 2 ) ) ( literal 3 ) ) >>> parse ( 1+2*3 " ) (+ ( literal 1 ) (* ( literal 2 ) ( literal 3 ) ) ) >>> parse ( 1.0 * 2+3 " ) (+ (* ( literal 1.0 ) ( literal 2 ) ) ( literal 3 ) ) >>> parse ( " ' hello ' +' world ' " ) (+ ( literal ' hello ' ) ( literal ' world ' ) )
The new tokenizer supports more literals , so our parser does that too , without any extra work .
And we ’re still using the 10 - line expression implementation we introduced at the beginning of this article .
The Python Expression Grammar #
So , let ’s do something about the grammar .
We could figure out the correct expression grammar from the grammar snippet shown earlier , but there ’s a more practical description in the section “ Evaluation order ” in Python ’s language reference .
The table in that section lists all expression operators in precedence order , from lowest to highest .
Here are the corresponding definitions ( starting at binding power 20 ) :
symbol( " lambda " , 20 ) symbol ( " if " , 20 ) infix_r ( " or " , 30 ) ; infix_r ( " and " , 40 ) ; prefix ( " not " , 50 ) infix ( " in " , 60 ) ; infix ( " not " , 60 ) infix ( " is " , 60 ) infix ( " < " , 60 ) ; infix ( " < = " , 60 ) infix ( " > " , 60 ) ; infix ( " >= " , 60 ) infix ( " <> " , 60 ) ; infix ( " != " , 60 ) ; infix ( " == " , 60 ) infix ( " | " , 70 ) ; infix ( " ^ " , 80 ) ; infix ( " & " , 90 ) infix ( " < < " , 100 ) ; infix ( " > > " , 100 ) infix ( " + " , 110 ) ; infix ( " - " , 110 ) infix ( " * " , 120 ) ; infix ( " / " , 120 ) ; infix ( " // " , 120 ) infix ( " % " , 120 ) prefix ( " - " , 130 ) ; prefix ( " + " , 130 ) ; prefix ( " ~ " , 130 ) infix_r ( " ** " , 140 ) symbol ( " . " , 150 ) ; symbol ( " [ " , 150 ) ; symbol ( " ( " , 150 )
These 16 lines define the syntax for 35 operators , and also provide behaviour for most of them .
However , tokens defined by the symbol helper have no intrinsic behaviour ; to make them work , additional code is needed .
There are also some intricacies caused by limitations in Python ’s tokenizer ; more about those later .
But before we start working on those symbols , we need to add behaviour to the pseudo - tokens too :
symbol( " ( literal ) " ) . nud = lambda self : self symbol ( " ( name ) " ) . nud = lambda self : self symbol ( " ( end ) " )
We can now do a quick sanity check :
>>> parse ( " 1+2 " ) (+ ( literal 1 ) ( literal 2 ) ) >>> parse ( " 2 < < 3 " ) ( << ( literal 2 ) ( literal 3 ) )
Parenthesized Expressions #
Let ’s turn our focus to the remaining symbols , and start with something simple : parenthesized expressions .
They can be implemented by a “ nud ” method on the “ ( ” token :
def nud ( self ) : expr = expression ( ) advance ( " ) " ) return expr symbol ( " ( " ) . nud = nud
The “ advance ” function used here is a helper function that checks that the current token has a given value , before fetching the next token .
def advance ( id=None ) : global token if id and token .id != id : raise SyntaxError ( " Expected %r " % id ) token = next ( )
The “ ) ” token must be registered ; if not , the tokenizer will report it as an invalid token .
To register it , just call the symbol function :
symbol ( " ) " )
Let ’s try it out :
>>> 1+2*3 (+ ( literal 1 ) (* ( literal 2 ) ( literal 3 ) ) ) >>>
( 1+2 ) * 3 (* (+ ( literal 1 ) ( literal 2 ) ) ( literal 3 ) )
Note that the “ nud ” method returns the inner expression , so the “ ( ” node wo n’t appear in the resulting syntax tree .
Also note that we ’re cheating here , for a moment : the “ ( ” prefix has two meanings in Python ; it can either be used for grouping , as above , or to create tuples .
We ’ll fix this below .
Ternary Operators #
Most custom methods look more or less exactly like their recursive - descent counterparts , and the code for inline if - else is no different :
def led ( self , left ) : self . first = left self .
second = expression ( ) advance ( " else " ) self . third = expression ( ) return self symbol ( " if " ) .led = led
Again , we need to register the extra token before we can try it out :
symbol( " else " ) >>> parse ( " 1 if 2 else 3 " ) ( if ( literal 1 ) ( literal 2 ) ( literal 3 ) )
Attribute and Item Lookups #
To handle attribute lookups , the “ . ” operator needs a “ led ” method .
For convenience , this version verifies that the period is followed by a proper name token ( this check could be made at a later stage as well ) :
def led ( self , left ) : if token .id != " ( name ) " : SyntaxError ( " Expected an attribute name . " ) self .
first = left self .
second = token advance ( ) return self symbol ( " . " ) .led = led >>> parse ( " foo.bar " ) (. ( name foo ) ( name bar ) )
Item access is similar ; just add a “ led ” method to the “ [ ” operator .
And since “ ] ” is part of the syntax , we need to register that symbol as well .
symbol ( " ] " ) def led ( self , left ) : self . first = left self .
second = expression ( ) advance ( " ] " ) return self symbol ( " [ " ) .led = led >>> parse ( " ' hello ' [ 0 ] " ) ( [ ( literal ' hello ' ) ( literal 0 ) )
Note that we ’re ending up with lots of code of the form :
def led ( self , left ) : ... symbol ( id ) .led = led
which is a bit inconvenient , if not else because it violates the “ do n’t repeat yourself ” rule ( the name of the method appears three times ) .
A simple decorator solves this :
def method ( s ) : assert issubclass (s , symbol_base ) def bind ( fn ) : setattr (s , fn.__name__ , fn ) return bind
This decorator picks up the function name , and attaches that to the given symbol .
This puts the symbol name before the method definition , and only requires you to write the method name once .
@ method ( symbol ( id ) ) def led ( self , left ) : ...
We ’ll use this in the following examples .
The other approach is n’t much longer , so you can still use it if you need to target Python 2.3 or older .
Just watch out for typos .
Function Calls #
A function call consists of an expression followed by a comma-separated expression list , in parentheses .
By treating the left parentesis as a binary operator , parsing this is straight - forward :
symbol ( " ) " ) ; symbol ( " , " ) @method ( symbol ( " ( " ) ) def led ( self , left ) : self .
first = left self .
second = [ ] if token .id != " ) " : while 1 : self.second.append(expression ( ) ) if token .id != " , " : break advance ( " , " ) advance ( " ) " ) return self >>> parse ( " hell o ( 1,2,3 ) " ) (( ( name hello ) [ ( literal 1 ) , ( literal 2 ) , ( literal 3 ) ] )
This is a bit simplified ; keyword arguments and the “ * ” and “ ** ” forms are not supported by this version .
To handle keyword arguments , look for an “ = ” after the first expression , and if that ’s found , check that the subtree is a plain name , and then call expression again to get the default value .
The other forms could be handled by “ nud ” methods on the corresponding operators , but it ’s probably easier to handle these too in this method .
Lambdas are also quite simple .
Since the “ lambda ” keyword is a prefix operator , we ’ll implement it using a “ nud ” method :
symbol ( " : " ) @ method ( symbol ( " lambda " ) ) def nud ( self ) : self . first = [ ] if token .id != " : " : argument_list( self.first ) advance ( " : " ) self.second = expression ( ) return self def argument_list ( list ) : while 1 : if token .id != " ( name ) " : SyntaxError ( " Expected an argument name . " ) list.append ( token ) advance ( ) if token .id != " , " : break advance ( " , " ) >>> parse ( " lambda a , b , c : a +b+ c " ) ( lambda [ ( name a ) , ( name b ) , ( name c ) ] (+ (+ ( name a ) ( name b ) ) ( name c ) ) )
Again , the argument list parsing is a bit simplified ; it does n’t handle default values and the “ * ” and “ ** ” forms .
See above for implementation hints .
Also note that there ’s no scope handling at the parser level in this implementation .
See Crockford ’s article for more on that topic .
Constants can be handled as literals ; the following “ nud ” method changes the token instance to a literal node , and inserts the token itself as the literal value :
def constant ( id ) : @ method ( symbol ( id ) ) def nud ( self ) : self .id = " ( literal ) " self.value = id return self constant ( " None " ) constant ( " True " ) constant ( " False " ) >>> parse ( " 1 is None " ) ( is ( literal 1 ) ( literal None ) ) >>> parse ( " True or False " ) ( or ( literal True ) ( literal False ) )
Python has two multi - token operators , “ is not ” and “ not in ” , but our parser does n’t quite treat them correctly :
>>> parse ( " 1 is not 2 " ) ( is ( literal 1 ) ( not ( literal 2 ) ) )
The problem is that the standard tokenize module does n’t understand this syntax , so it happily returns these operators as two separate tokens :
>>> list ( tokenize ( " 1 is not 2 " ) ) [ ( literal 1 ) , ( is ) , ( not ) , ( literal 2 ) , ( ( end ) ) ]
In other words , “ 1 is not 2 ” is handled as “ 1 is ( not 2 ) ” , which is n’t the same thing :
>>> 1 is not 2 True >>>
1 is ( not 2 ) False
One way to fix this is to tweak the tokenizer ( e.g. by inserting a combining filter between the raw Python parser and the token instance factory ) , but it ’s probably easier to fix this with custom “ led ” methods on the “ is ” and “ not ” operators :
@ method ( symbol ( " not " ) ) def led ( self , left ) : if token .id != " in " : raise SyntaxError ( " Invalid syntax " ) advance ( ) self .id = " not in " self .
first = left self .
second = expression ( 60 ) return self @ method ( symbol ( " is " ) ) def led ( self , left ) : if token . id == " not " : advance ( ) self .id = " is not " self .
first = left self .
second = expression ( 60 ) return self >>> parse ( " 1 in 2 " ) ( in ( literal 1 ) ( literal 2 ) ) >>> parse ( " 1 not in 2 " ) ( not in ( literal 1 ) ( literal 2 ) ) >>> parse ( " 1 is 2 " ) ( is ( literal 1 ) ( literal 2 ) ) >>> parse ( " 1 is not 2 " ) ( is not ( literal 1 ) ( literal 2 ) )
This means that the “ not ” operator handles both unary “ not ” and binary “ not in ” .
Tuples , Lists , and Dictionary Displays #
As noted above , the “ ( ” prefix serves two purposes in Python ; it ’s used for grouping , and to create tuples ( it ’s also used as a binary operator , for function calls ) .
To handle tuples , we need to replace the “ nud ” method with a version that can distinguish between tuples and a plain parenthesized expression .
Python ’s tuple - forming rules are simple ; if a pair of parenteses are empty , or contain at least one comma , it ’s a tuple .
Otherwise , it ’s an expression .
Or in other words :
( ) is a tuple
( 1 ) is a parenthesized expression
( 1 , ) is a tuple
( 1 , 2 ) is a tuple
Here ’s a “ nud ” replacement that implements these rules :
@method( symbol ( " ( " ) ) def nud( self ) : self. first = [ ] comma =
False if token .id != " ) " : while 1 : if token .id == " ) " : break self.first.append(expression ( ) ) if token .id != " , " : break comma = True advance ( " , " ) advance ( " ) " ) if not self .
first or comma : return self # tuple else : return self .
first [ 0 ] >>> parse ( " ( ) " ) ( ( ) >>> parse ( " ( 1 ) " ) ( literal 1 ) >>> parse ( " ( 1 , ) " ) ( ( [ ( literal 1 ) ] ) >>> parse ( " ( 1 , 2 ) " ) ( ( [ ( literal 1 ) , ( literal 2 ) ] )
Lists and dictionaries are a bit simpler ; they ’re just plain lists of expressions or expression pairs .
Do n’t forget to register the extra tokens .
symbol ( " ] " ) @ method( symbol ( " [ " ) ) def nud( self ) : self . first = [ ] if token .id != " ] " : while 1 : if token .id == " ] " : break self.first.append(expression ( ) ) if token .id != " , " : break advance ( " , " ) advance ( " ] " ) return self >>> parse ( " [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] " ) ( [ [ ( literal 1 ) , ( literal 2 ) , ( literal 3 ) ] ) symbol ( " } " ) ; symbol ( " : " ) @method( symbol ( " { " ) ) def nud( self ) : self . first = [ ] if token .id != " } " : while 1 : if token . id == " } " : break self.first.append(expression ( ) ) advance ( " : " ) self.first.append(expression ( ) ) if token .id != " , " : break advance ( " , " ) advance ( " } " ) return self >>> { 1 : ' one ' , 2 : ' two'} ( { [ ( literal 1 ) , ( literal ' one ' ) , ( literal 2 ) , ( literal ' two ' ) ] )
Note that Python allows you to use optional trailing commas when creating lists , tuples , and dictionaries ; an extra if - statement at the beginning of the collection loop takes care of that case .
At roughly 250 lines of code ( including the entire parser machinery ) , there are still a few things left to add before we can claim to fully support the Python 2.5 expression syntax , but we ’ve covered a remarkably large part of the syntax with very little work .
And as we ’ve seen thoughout this article , parsers using this algorithm and implementation approach are readable , easy to extend , and , as we ’ll see in a moment , surprisingly fast .
While this article has focussed on expressions , the algorithm can be easily extended for statement - oriented syntaxes .
See Crockford ’s article for one way to do that .
All in all , Pratt ’s parsing algorithm is a great addition to the Python parsing toolbox , and the implementation strategy outlined in this article is a simple way to quickly implement such parsers .
As we ’ve seen , the parser makes only a few Python calls per token , which means that it should be pretty efficient ( or as Pratt put it , “ efficient in practice if not in theory ” ) .
To test practical performance , I picked a 456 character long Python expression ( about 300 tokens ) from the Python FAQ , and parsed it with a number of different tools .
Here are some typical results under Python 2.5 :
topdown parse ( to abstract syntax tree ) : 4.0 ms
built - in parse ( to tuple tree ) : 0.60 ms
built - in compile ( to code object ) : 0.68 ms
compiler parse ( to abtract syntax tree ) : 4.8 ms
compiler compile ( to code object ) : 18 ms
If we tweak the parser to work on a precomputed list of tokens ( obtained by running “ list( tokenize_python ( program ) ) ” ) , the parsing time drops to just under 0.9 ms .
In other words , only about one fourth of the time for the full parse is spent on token instance creation , parsing , and tree building .
The rest is almost entirely spent in Python ’s tokenize module .
With a faster tokenizer , this algorithm would get within 2 x or so from Python ’s built - in tokenizer / parser .
The built - in parse test is in itself quite interesting ; it uses Python ’s internal tokenizer and parser module ( both of which are written in C ) , and uses the parser module ( also written in C ) to convert the internal syntax tree object to a tuple tree .
This is fast , but results in a remarkably undecipherable low - level tree :
>>> parser.st2tuple(parser.expr(
" 1+2 " ) ) ( 258 , ( 326 , ( 303 , ( 304 , ( 305 , ( 306 , ( 307 , ( 309 , ( 310 , ( 311 , ( 312 , ( 313 , ( 314 , ( 315 , ( 316 , ( 317 , ( 2 , ' 1 ' ) ) ) ) ) , ( 14 , '+ ' ) , ( 314 , ( 315 , ( 316 , ( 317 , ( 2 , ' 2 ' ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) , ( 4 , '' ) , ( 0 , '' ) )
( In this example , 2 means number , 14 means plus , 4 is newline , and 0 is end of program .
The 3 - digit numbers represent intermediate rules in the Python grammar . )
The compiler parse test uses the parse function from the compiler package instead ; this function uses Python ’s internal tokenizer and parser , and then turns the resulting low - level structure into a much nicer abstract tree :
>>> import compiler >>> compiler.parse( " 1+2 " , " eval " ) Expression ( Add(( Const ( 1 ) , Const ( 2 ) ) ) )
This conversion ( done in Python ) turns out to be more work than parsing the expression with the topdown parser ; with the code in this article , we get an abstract tree in about 85 % of the time , despite using a really slow tokenizer .
Code Notes #
The code in this article uses global variables to hold parser state ( the “ token ” variable and the “ next ” helper ) .
If you need a thread - safe parser , these should be moved to a context object .
This will result in a slight performance hit , but there are some surprising ways to compensate for that , by trading a little memory for performance .
More on that in a later article .

CIA admits they will continue rendition program , which allows torture overseas John Byrne
Published : Thursday April 24 , 2008

Print This Email This Documents show they expected legal challenges from the start The Central Intelligence Agency knew from the beginning that its secret detention and torturous interrogation tactics probably bordered on illegal from the start , according to new documents identified through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit .
In a filing yesterday , the CIA said it had identified 7,000 pages of classified memos , emails and other records relating to President Bush 's secret detention and interrogation program .
Human rights groups quickly jumped on the filing -- which came after their own Freedom of Information Act lawsuit seeking information about those detained .
The CIA also acknowledged in their filings that the program will continue .
Terror suspects detained or " renditioned " by the United States are transferred to third party countries that allow torture which gives the US a legal loophole to allow harsh interrogation without being legally liable .
Such suspects , who effectively disappear , are held without access to courts .
The US has refused to produce a list of the suspects it is holding in sites overseas , and only recently provided a list of those held captive at Guantánamo Bay .
Amnesty International says at least 30 people are believed to still be held in secret prisons .
In 2006 , President Bush muted dissent surrounding the program by announcing that he would transfer 14 " high - value " detainees to Guantánamo Bay .
The filing also shows that the agency sought legal advice from the White House Office of Legal Counsel numerous times over several years .
" The CIA 's purpose in requesting advice from OLC was the very likely prospect of criminal , civil , or administrative litigation against the CIA and CIA personnel who participate in the Program , " Ralph S. DiMaio , information review officer for the CIA 's clandestine service , said in the documents .
Such proceedings , he added , would " be virtually inevitable . "
Nineteen documents were withheld ; the Bush Administration cited " presidential communications privilege . "
The withholding of documents under presidential privlige has been a common practice of the Bush Administration -- but its decision to do so in this case appears a tacit acknowledgment of the high - level interaction between Bush advisors and CIA officials .
The filing says that some of the withheld documents were " authored or solicited and received by the President 's senior advisors in connection with a decision , or potential decision , to be made by the president . "
Rights groups say CIA is hiding criminal activity Amnesty International USA , the Center for Constitutional Rights and the International Human Rights Clinic at NYU School of Law were the key litigants seeking the documents made the claim following a summary judgment motion by the agency .
 For the first time , the CIA has acknowledged that extensive records exist relating to its use of enforced disappearances and secret prisons ,  Curt Goering , AIUSA senior deputy executive director , said in a statement yesterday .
 Given what we already know about documents written by Bush administration officials trying to justify torture and other human rights crimes , one does not need a fertile imagination to conclude that the real reason for refusing to disclose these documents has more to do with avoiding disclosure of criminal activity than national security .
RAW STORY was the first news outlet to identify the exact location of one of the sites in the CIA 's secret prison network , which was revealed first by the Washington Post .
Raw Story identified a prison in northeastern Poland , Stare Kiejkuty , that was used as a transit point for terror suspects .
Once a Soviet - era compound once used by German intelligence in World War II , Stare Kiejkuty is best known as having been the only Russian intelligence training school to operate outside the Soviet Union .
Its prominence in the Soviet era suggests that it may have been the facility first identified  but never named  when the Washington Posts Dana Priest revealed the existence of the CIAs secret prison network in November 2005 .
The groups say that they 're not the only ones being stonewalled .
Congress , they say , is getting the short end of the stick as well .
" Documents released to plaintiffs by the CIA demonstrate that many within the government itself have been unable to obtain accurate information from the CIA , " the groups said .
" These documents , which include letters from Members of Congress to the CIA , demonstrate a pattern of withholding information from Congress .
In a pointed bipartisan letter on Oct. 16 , 2003 , then - Chair and Ranking Member of the House Select Committee on Intelligence requested that CIA Director George Tenet provide senior level briefings on the treatment of , and information obtained by , three men known to be held in secret CIA detention , admonishing the CIA by stating that the committee was ' frustrated with the quality of the information ' provided in past briefings . "
 The CIA has employed illegal techniques such as torture , enforced disappearances , and extraordinary rendition ,  said Meg Satterthwaite , Director of the NYU IHRC .
 It can not use FOIA exemptions as a shield to hide its violations of U.S. and international law . 
CIA has begun to lose , destroy documents
Two recent reports signal that the agency has begun to destroy evidence of harsh interrogations conducted at US prisons .
Last year , the CIA acknowledged it had destroyed videotapes of two interrogations they were asked to provide to the Sept. 11 commission .
Earlier this week , the erstwhile director of interrogations at Guantánamo Bay said records of a prisoner who accused his captors of torturing him had been destroyed .
" Retired general Michael Dunlavey , who supervised Guantánamo for eight months in 2002 , tried to locate records on Mohammed al - Qahtani , accused by the US of plotting the 9/11 attacks , but found they had disappeared , " the Guardian writes .
" The records on al - Qahtani , who was interrogated for 48 days - " were backed up ... after I left , there was a snafu and all was lost . "

UPDATE : The AALS has joined in boycotting the Manchester Grand Hyatt Hotel over its owners donation to anti same - sex marriage amendment in California .
Thank you for joining Californians Against Hate & Queers United in demanding a change of location .
The statement below was released on the AALS website .
" The AALS 2009 Annual Meeting will take place January 6 - 10 , 2009 , in San Diego , California .
Several years ago the Association booked rooms at the San Diego Marriott and the Manchester Grand Hyatt .
In the last few weeks there have been suggestions that the Association should boycott the Hyatt because its owner has contributed money to a ballot initiative designed to overturn the California Supreme Court 's May decision in favor of same - sex marriage .
In addressing this issue , the Executive Committee has sought to ensure that the Annual Meeting serves the needs of all participants to the maximum extent possible given our contractual obligations to the hotels .
Our contracts with the hotels provide that each hotel reserve a block of guest rooms , and leave to the AALS the choice of where to locate the AALS Registration , Exhibit Hall , Section Programs , Presidential Programs , and House of Representatives meetings .
We will honor our contracts with both hotels , and we have exercised our option to hold all AALS events at the Marriott to ensure the maximum participation by our members . "
Click and call below to urge AALS to use a different venue ...
The Association of American Law Schools is scheduled to hold their annual meeting Jan 6 - 10 , 2009 in California at the San Diego Manchester Grand Hyatt .
The hotel has been a site of controversy and protest because of the owner , Mr. Manchester 's financial contribution to the anti-marriage amendment ( proposition 8 ) in California .
Gay rights backers in addition to dozens of legal organizations who were to be at the conference are threatening to boycott the conference if an alternative venue is not chosen .

Advertisement Thousands of people have been forced to flee their homes following an explosion at a propane gas plant in the north of the Canadian city of Toronto .
A two - mile ( 3.2 km ) exclusion zone was set up as police ordered residents in the Keele and Wilson areas to leave .
The series of explosions at 0350 local time ( 0850 BST ) on Sunday also shut down one the city 's busiest highways .
A veteran firefighter died of a heart attack at the scene .
There were no reports of serious injury .
Witnesses described the sky lighting up in the glow of an enormous fireball before turning black with smoke , and some residents said the blast caused their houses to rock .
" It was just a tremendous explosion and blew all the windows out of the house .
I just managed to get out of there in time , " local resident Robert Helman told the Associated Press news agency .
Residents were immediately bussed out the area Firefighters battled the blazes at the Sunrise Propane Industrial Gases facility for several hours .
Toronto fire services division commander Bob O'Hallarn said that firefighters were close to extinguishing all the burning tanks , significantly reducing the risk of another explosion .
" I think we were very lucky , " he said .
" There was a very large amount of fire when we arrived .
It could have been much more serious . "
Mr O'Hallarn said he saw at least five badly damaged houses , adding that it could be hours before residents are allowed back to their homes .

Madonna Alex Rodriguez Affair ?
New York Yankees '( A - Rod ) has found himself smack dab in the middle of divorce rumors plaguingand
Rodriguez has been visiting Madonna at her New York City apartment in Central Park late at night and has " all the doormen talking " according to Us Weekly .
Sources say Rodriguez began visiting Madonna as early as the night after his wife Cynthia gave birth to their second daughter .
Rodriguez attended Madonna 's concert in New York City on April 30 - just nine days after his wife gave birth in Miami , and Madonna sat in his seats at a Yankees game on June 22 .
While playing in Central Park on June 25 , her son Rocco , 7 , was sporting Yankees gear .
Although Madonna 's rep Liz Rosenberg denies reports of an imminent divorce , according to the London Times , Madonna has contacted top divorce lawyer Fiona Shackleton , who handled Paul McCartney 's divorce from Heather Mills .
" Madonna and Alex have the same manager , Guy Oseary , " Rosenberg says .
" They have met .
They know each other and Madonna took her kids to a Yankees game last week .
There 's really not anything to comment on beyond that . "
Ritchie arrived in New York last night .
It is believed that the couple do not have a prenup .
Nanopaper made of gently processed natural cellulose nanofibers is found to have remarkable strength ; it has a tensile strength almost equaling that of structural steel .
Lars Berglund from the Swedish Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm , Sweden found that the mechanical processes used to pulp wood damages the natural fibers , weakening them .
Berglund developed a process to extract the fibers , keeping their properties intact .
The secret to the nanopaper 's performance is not only the strength of the undamaged cellulose fibres , but also they way they are arranged into networks .
Although strongly bound together , they are still able to slip and slide over each other to dissipate strains and stresses .
The individual cellulose fibres are also much smaller than in conventional paper .
" A regular paper network has fibres 30 micrometres in diameter , here we are at a scale three orders of magnitude smaller , " says Berglund .
" The material [ has ] very small defects compared with a conventional paper network . "
Mechanical testing shows it has a tensile strength of 214 megapascals , making it stronger than cast iron ( 130 MPa ) and nearly as strong as structural steel used in buildings and bridges ( 250 MPa ) .
Normal paper is flimsy ; it has a tensile strength less than 1 MPa .
The tests used strips 40 millimeters long by 5 mm wide and about 50 micrometers thick .
Science fiction readers may recall the material used in Jules Verne 's 1866 classic Robur the Conqueror .
... Unsized paper , with the sheets impregnated with dextrin and starch and squeezed in hydraulic presses , will form a material as hard as steel .
There are made of it pulleys , rails , and wagon - wheels , much more solid than metal wheels , and far lighter .
And it was this lightness and solidity which Robur availed himself of in building his aerial locomotive ...

But this vulnerability is a mirage .
The size of plausible disruptions , not total consumption , determines the adequacy of global reserves .
The worst oil disruptions in history deprived global markets of five million to six million barrels per day .
Specifically , the collapse of the Iranian oil industry during the revolution in 1978 cut production by nearly five million barrels a day , and the sanctions on Iraq after its conquest of Kuwait in 1990 eliminated 5.3 million barrels of supply .
If a future disruption were as bad as history ’s worst , American and allied governments ’ crude oil stocks alone could replace every lost barrel for eight months .

Current fears about energy security focus on Iran .
For example , Tehran could sharply cut its oil exports to drive up global prices .
Of course , this would be the economic equivalent of suicide terrorism : oil exports provide more than 80 percent of Iranian government revenues , and a major cutback would wreck Iran ’s economy .
It would also be futile because the industrialized world could easily replace Iranian oil .
Iran only exports 2.5 million barrels each day .
A coordinated release of reserve crude by the United States and its European and Asian allies could replace missing Iranian barrels for a year and a half .
Iran is vulnerable ; the West is not .
Of course , we are told , Iran might be able to take Saudi , Kuwaiti and Iraqi oil off the market , too , by attacking oil tankers as they pass through the Strait of Hormuz , along Iran ’s coast .
It ’s conceivable , but not likely .
Significantly impeding oil traffic would require a sustained military campaign .
Dozens of tankers carry more than 15 million barrels of crude through the strait every day .
The water is so deep that the navigable channel for supertankers is 20 miles wide at its narrowest point .
There is simply too much traffic across too much space for the waterway to be easily blocked .
Countries have attacked oil infrastructure before , and the results were underwhelming .
During the Iran - Iraq war , Baghdad and Tehran struck each other ’s oil terminals and tankers repeatedly , but they proved to be very resilient targets .
Rugged structures and quick maintenance meant that Iran ’s Kharg Island terminal kept pumping despite repeated bombings .
Tankers , which dwarf aircraft carriers , have thick hulls designed to prevent oil spills and , when attacked , proved to have few sensitive parts where a “ lucky ” hit could cause serious damage .
They managed to keep the oil flowing through Persian Gulf waters throughout the Iran - Iraq war .
Today , Iran has more advanced anti-ship weapons , and it could surely harass commercial tanker traffic .
But it would be hard pressed to sustain an anti-shipping campaign sufficient to reduce oil flows drastically for weeks on end , especially in the face of an intense military response .
Even if Iran were able to reduce oil flow though the strait by , say , 30 percent , global reserves could replace losses of that magnitude for more than nine months  plenty of time for the Navy to counter Iranian military operations .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Oil prices hit a record high $ 117 a barrel Friday as jitters over Nigerian oil supplies outweighed a rally in the dollar and fears of an economic slowdown in giant energy consumer China .

U.S. light crude settled up $ 1.83 at $ 116.96 a barrel , before hitting a record $ 117 .
London Brent crude gained $ 1.49 to $ 113.92 .
Oil prices have more than quadrupled since 2002 as supply struggles to keep up with booming demand , especially in China and other emerging economies .
“ The bulls still hold the cards , ” said Mike Fitzpatrick of MF Global in New York .
A Nigerian rebel group said Friday it had sabotaged a major oil pipeline operated by Royal Dutch Shell RDSa.L and vowed to step up attacks on oil installations .
Shell officials , which is currently pumping 400,000 barrels per day below capacity in the OPEC nation due to sabotage and security concerns , confirmed a small amount of production had been shut in .
Strikers at the major southern French oil port of Fos-Lavera vowed to remain on picket lines through Saturday .
The strike trapped 23 vessels , including four crude oil tankers and six refined products tankers in the port .
A similar strike March lasted 17 days and forced four oil refineries with 603,000 barrels per day of combined capacity to curtail operations , helping spur a late spring rally in European diesel prices .
A British union will launch a two - day strike from April 27 at Ineos Grangemouth refinery , forcing it to shut down with an impact on the North Sea Forties pipeline system , which terminates there , both sides said on Friday .
Strong demand for diesel fuel in emerging markets has been offsetting weakness in U.S. oil demand , analysts at Goldman Sachs said in a research note released Friday .
Goldman expects U.S. crude oil futures to average $ 105 a barrel this year and end the year at $ 115 a barrel , driven by tight distillate supplies and continued increases in the cost of building new oil production capacity .
Oil had fallen as low as $ 112.72 overnight after the dollar rallied against other major currencies as Citigroup C.N , the biggest U.S. bank , delivered better than expected quarterly results .
A sharp fall in China ’s stock market on Friday spurred concerns over a possible economic slowdown in China , the world ’s second largest consumer of oil .
China 's stock market fell nearly 4 percent to a 12 - month closing low as the biggest stock , PetroChina 601857 .SS slid below its October initial public offering price in Shanghai .
CANBERRA ( Reuters ) - More than 40 percent of Australia , an area the size of India , remains untouched by humans , making the country as critical to the world ’s environment as the Amazon rainforests , a study said on Wednesday .
Australia has some of the last great wilderness , with three million square kilometers ( 1.1 million square miles ) largely unchanged by industrial civilization , a report for international conservation watchdogs the Pew Environment Group and Nature Conservancy said .
“ It ’s rare on earth in this century , ” Australian wildlife ecologist and report author Barry Traill told local radio .
“ We need to hold onto this country .
It ’s just so precious , ” he said .
Australia was one of five great remaining wilderness zones , along with Antarctica , the Amazon , the Sahara Desert and Canada ’s northern Boreal , the report said .
Most of the untouched areas were in the country ’s vast interior and northern savanna , including largely Aboriginal Arnhem Land , northern Cape York Peninsula , the vast southwest Nullarbor plain and the central Gibson desert .
Pristine areas faced their biggest threat from introduced feral animal and plant species including pigs , rabbits , foxes , buffaloes and noxious weeds , the report said .
“ Around that core of wild lands , hundreds of millions more acres are healthy enough that they can still support the maintenance of resilient ecosystems , ” Pew said on its website .
In addition to its wilderness treasures , Australia had some of the world ’s most protected marine areas , with the Great Barrier Reef the largest living organism , it said .
Australia , the world ’s oldest continent , ranked first globally for the total number of unique native mammal and reptile species , and among the top five countries in total numbers of endemic plants , birds and amphibians .
Traill said Australia ’s government should be recruiting up to 5,000 extra Aboriginal rangers to act as guardians of untouched areas , with only 10 percent of the country currently protected as parklands and reserve .
“ If you drive through and see these vast areas of bushland , it looks in pretty good shape , but there are subtle changes happening , and we need to get people back out there managing it , ” he said .
Women of the Upper East Side are breathing a collective sigh of relief at the news that a plastic surgeon has written a book for the children of cosmetic - surgery patients .
My Beautiful Mommy explains why mommy goes to the doctor one day and comes back looking like an entirely different person .
The New York Sun reports :
The story focuses on a teddy bear - clutching little girl whose mother is about to go in for a nose job and a tummy tuck .
In the book , the mother tells her child : “ You see , as I got older , my body stretched and I could n’t fit into my clothes anymore .
Dr. Michael is going to fix that and make me feel better . ”
Could this be the inception of an untapped genre of literature ?
Since it was mocked on the Today show this morning , probably !
Perhaps soon we ’ll be seeing a boom in children ’s books designed to help wealthy kids cope with the pressures of privilege .
Other suggested reading could include Heather Has Three Nannies , Daddy Has Two Indictments for Stock Fraud , or its sequel , Daddy Has to Go Away Now But He ’ll Be Back in 8 to 12 Years .

Sirnak province regularly sees Turkey - PKK clashes
Two Turkish soldiers and three Kurdish rebels have died in clashes in south - eastern Turkey , near the border with Iraq , security officials say .
The fighting took place on Sunday during an operation against the banned Kurdistan Workers Party ( PKK ) in Sirnak province , the Turkish officials said .
Turkey has launched repeated air and land attacks in the region , targeting PKK rebels based in northern Iraq .
The PKK has been fighting for Kurdish self - rule since 1984 .
A PKK spokeswoman , Sozdar Avesta , has demanded a ceasefire in the Mount Ararat area , further north , where the PKK is holding three German tourists hostage .
She said " the PKK is ready to release the three German tourists on condition that Turkey halts its military attacks in the area where they were captured " .
They were snatched last Wednesday .
The hostages were being held in protest at German pressure on PKK supporters in Germany , she said , adding : " We urge the German government to undertake a new policy towards the Kurds " .
Ms Avesta , speaking in the Qandil mountains in northern Iraq , said an international organisation such as the Red Cross should facilitate the hostages ' release .
More than 30,000 people have died since the PKK began fighting for self - rule .
Turkey , the EU and US consider it to be a terrorist organisation .

A simple recipe -- including just four ingredients -- can transform adult human skin cells into cells that resemble embryonic stem cells , researchers report in the journal Cell .
The converted cells have many of the physical , growth and genetic features typically found in embryonic stem cells and can differentiate to produce other tissue types , including neurons and heart tissue , according to the researchers .
They added , however , that a comprehensive screen of the activity of more than 30,000 genes showed that the so - called " induced pluripotent stem ( iPS ) cells " are similar , not identical , to embryonic stem cells .
" Pluripotent " refers to the ability to differentiate into most other cell types .
The chemical cocktail used in the new study is identical to one the team showed could produce iPS cells from adult mouse cells in another Cell report last year .
That came as a surprise , said Shinya Yamanaka of Kyoto University in Japan , because human embryonic stem cells differ from those in mice .
Those differences had led them to suspect " that some other factors might be required to generate human iPS cells , " he said .
The findings are an important step forward in the quest for embryonic stem cell - like cells that might sidestep the ethical stumbling blocks of stem cells obtained from human embryos .
He emphasized , however , that it would be " premature to conclude that iPS cells can replace embryonic stem cells . "
Embryonic stem cells , derived from the inner cell mass of mammalian blastocysts -- balls of cells that develop after fertilization and go on to form a developing embryo-- have the ability to grow indefinitely while maintaining pluripotency , the researchers explained .
Those properties have led to expectations that human embryonic stem cells might have many scientific and clinical applications , most notably the potential to treat patients with various diseases and injuries , such as juvenile diabetes and spinal cord injury .
The use of human embryos , however , faces ethical controversies that hinder the applications of human embryonic stem cells , they continued .
In addition , it is difficult to generate patient or disease - specific embryonic stem cells , which are required for their effective application .
One way to circumvent these issues is to induce pluripotent status in other cells of the body by direct reprogramming , Yamanaka said .

Last year , his team found that four factors , known as Oct3/4 , Sox2 , c - Myc , and Klf4 , could lend differentiated fibroblast cells taken from embryonic or adult mice the pluripotency normally reserved for embryonic stem cells .
Fibroblasts make up structural fibers found in connective tissue .
Those four factors are " transcripton factors , " meaning that they control the activity of other genes .
They were also known to play a role in early embryos and embryonic stem cell identity .
The researchers have now shown that the same four factors can generate iPS cells from fibroblasts taken from human skin .
" From about 50,000 transfected human cells , we obtained approximately 10 iPS cell clones , " Yamanaka said .
" This efficiency may sound very low , but it means that from one experiment , with a single ten centimeter dish , you can get multiple iPS cell lines . "
The iPS cells were indistinguishable from embryonic stem cells in terms of their appearance and behavior in cell culture , they found .
They also express genetic markers that are used by scientists to identify embryonic stem cells .
Human embryonic stem cells and iPS cells display similar patterns of global gene activity .
They showed that the converted human cells could differentiate to form three " germ layers " in cell culture .
Those primary germ layers in embryos eventually give rise to all the body 's tissues and organs .
They further showed that the human iPS cells could give rise to neurons using a method earlier demonstrated for human embryonic stem cells .
The iPS cells could also be made to produce cardiac muscle cells , they found .
Indeed , after 12 days of differentiation , clumps of cells in the laboratory dishes started beating .
The human iPS cells injected under the skin of mice produced tumors after nine weeks .
Those tumors contained various tissues including gut - like epithelial tissue , striated muscle , cartilage and neural tissue .
They finally showed that iPS cells can also be generated in the same way from other human cells .
" We should now be able to generate patient - and disease - specific iPS cells , and then make various cells , such as cardiac cells , liver cells and neural cells , " Yamanaka said .
" These cells should be extremely useful in understanding disease mechanisms and screening effective and safe drugs .
If we can overcome safety issues , we may be able to use human iPS cells in cell transplantation therapies . "

George Bush is poised for a major victory this week as Congress nears final approval of a plan to provide legal immunity to private companies that aided government wiretapping as well as expand those spying powers .
Debate on the wiretapping bill is slated to begin in the Senate today , with a vote expected by week 's end .
Although civil liberties groups and liberal activists have pressed Democrats to oppose the proposal , its approval is considered a near - certainty .
The bill 's most controversial provision gives legal immunity to telecommunications companies that helped the Bush administration monitor phone calls and emails without a court warrant in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks .
The immunity debate has created particular headaches for Barack Obama , who last fall joined a group of liberal senators in blocking a separate wiretapping bill that contained a liability shield for telecoms .
But after securing the Democratic presidential nomination , Obama veered to the centre and indicated he would support the wiretapping plan even if the final version cancelled lawsuits against the companies .
His staunchest supporters on the left protested the sudden shift , even forming a network on Obama 's website to castigate him .
Obama attempted to smooth over the rift in a statement posted to that online network yesterday .
" Given the choice between voting for an improved yet imperfect bill , and losing important surveillance tools , I 've chosen to support the current compromise , " Obama wrote to the backers disenchanted with his move .
" Democracy can not exist without strong differences .
And going forward , some of you may decide that my [ wiretapping ] position is a deal breaker .
That 's okay .
But I think it is worth pointing out that our agreement on the vast majority of issues that matter outweighs the differences we may have . "
The wiretapping plan passed the House of Representatives on June 20 by a 293- 129 vote , with several Democrats from conservative states joining Republicans to make up the margin of victory .
The bill seemed to face an uphill battle as recently as February , when Democrats in Congress allowed the previous , Republican - written statute on government wiretaps to expire rather than give in to White House demands on immunity .
But the tide turned in favour of compromise this summer , with existing wiretaps set for de-authorisation in August and Democrats fearing election - year attacks on national security issues .
A deal was eventually reached between House Democratic majority leader Steny Hoyer and Republican leaders .
Democrats won some concessions from the White House : the new plan prohibits warrant - free spying on Americans travelling overseas and requires a court to evaluate the basis for wiretaps before they go into effect – not after .
Still , the American civil liberties union ( ACLU ) and other leading civil - rights groups have condemned the bill , calling it a capitulation to Bush and an unconstitutional violation of privacy rights .
" Not only will the [ wiretapping bill ] allow for the wholesale violation of Americans ' fourth amendment rights , it will shut the door on investigations into the administration 's warrant - less wiretapping program by closing active court cases , " Colleen Connell , executive director of the Illinois ACLU , said in a statement .
" The Senate is the last opportunity for any real improvements to be made to this legislation - senators should fix the bill or vote it down . "
Carlos Ghosn is blunt about Nissan ’s strategy when it comes to electric vehicles : they must be zero-emission , running only on electricity .
That is where the CEO differs from other automakers , who are largely pursuing hybrids with gasoline or diesel engines as range extenders .
Nissan will put a pure EV on the road in the U.S. and Japan in 2010 in small volumes .
In the case of the U.S. , the single model will initially be sold only in California .
By 2012 , he says Nissan EVs will be volume vehicles — multiple models sold in large numbers throughout North America and the rest of the world .
In a roundtable discussion with media in Nashville , Tennessee , to mark the official opening of Nissan ’s new North American headquarters , it sounds like the car is well on its way to development .
It rides on its own , all - new , dedicated electric - car platform , meaning you wo n’t see gasoline and diesel versions , Ghosn says .
The design is modern — he shoots down suggestions EVs are boring or banal by definition — and it will be fun to drive , including on a track .
Not a Small City Car
According to Ghosn , it is not a small , city car .
He would not be more specific on which segment it will play in , other than to say it will work as a family vehicle , which suggests mid-size or even larger .
Another area where Ghosn wants to be vigilant is in determining what consumers will accept in an electric car in terms of range and charging it .
“ If you put too much restraint on a consumer , you risk losing him , ” he says , adding once Nissan has a better sense of what buyers want and will tolerate , the automaker will know better how to act .
To help in that research , Ghosn uses his visit to Nashville to announce that the Renault - Nissan Alliance and state of Tennessee are forming a partnership to promote zero-emission vehicles , including EVs , in Tennessee , with the help of the Tennessee Valley Authority ( TVA ) and other partners .
Ghosn and Tennessee Governor Phil Bredesen signed the agreement during a meeting Monday night in Nashville .
In May , Ghosn said Renault - Nissan intends to be the leader in zero-emission vehicles — it is among the goals of the 2012 Nissan five - year business plan .
Charge ’ Er Up , Please
The Tennessee project will work to figure out such things as volumes of vehicles , what kind of charge they should have , and how many charging stations are needed , with the goal of having them on the road in Tennessee by 2011 .
Ghosn said the project does not need big volumes initially .
The Renault - Nissan Alliance has similar initiatives in Israel , Denmark , and —as of two weeks ago — Portugal .
Ghosn says each one is tailored to the region , noting the necessary range in many countries is far less than in North America where motorists travel longer distances .
Ghosn says that , while there is an immediate focus on EVs , Nissan continues to work on fuel - cell vehicles as a long - term solution .
He describes the company ’s reluctant foray into hybrids as a necessary move to hedge its bets in today ’s competitive world .
Nissan is also adding capacity to be in the battery business .

And the Washington Post says so :
For four days , Sen. John McCain and his allies have accused Sen.
Barack Obama of snubbing wounded soldiers by canceling a visit to a military hospital because he could not take reporters with him , despite no evidence that the charge is true .
The attacks are part of a newly aggressive McCain operation whose aim is to portray the Democratic presidential candidate as a craven politician more interested in his image than in ailing soldiers , a senior McCain adviser said .
They come despite repeated pledges by the Republican that he will never question his rival ’s patriotism .
***
The Obama campaign has denied that was the reason he called off the visit .
In fact , there is no evidence that he planned to take anyone to the American hospital other than a military adviser , whose status as a campaign staff member sparked last - minute concern among Pentagon officials that the visit would be an improper political event .
*** McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds said again yesterday that the Republican ’s version of events is correct , and that Obama canceled the visit because he was not allowed to take reporters and cameras into the hospital .
“ It is safe to say that , according to press reports , Barack Obama avoided , skipped , canceled the visit because of those reasons , ” he said .
“ We ’re not making a leap here . ”
Asked repeatedly for the “ reports , ” Bounds provided three examples , none of which alleged that Obama had wanted to take members of the media to the hospital .
***
A reconstruction of the circumstances surrounding Obama ’s decision not to visit Landstuhl , based on firsthand reporting from the trip , shows that his campaign never contemplated taking the media with him .
Excellent work , Steve Schmidt .
You now have the WaPo calling your candidate a liar because of a hit ad that you designed for … media consumption only .
Additionally , this is bad for the future McCain campaign efforts because they have now called all those reporters questioning their claims liars , because they were there , first - hand , and know that the McCain camp is making things up .
Finally , nothing better than disgracing your spokesman , forcing him to lie several times .
Well played .
The McCain campaign forgot one basic thing on this attempted smear - the ego of the reporters and the mainstream media .
These folks are fine with printing any lie you can come up with , as long as they have plausible deniability .
You can feed them all sorts of shit about someone possessing WMD , or about Obama being Muslim , etc. , so long as you cite unnamed sources or undisclosed sources in the government or anonymous experts , and you leave the blame somewhere else .
They will print any old rumor if you do that .
But when you try to make them part of the lie , you just ca n’t get away with it .
They were there on the trip - and the McCain idiots tried to make them part of the lie .
And they might have gotten away with it had the Obama camp not fought back and had Andrea Mitchell not started the groundswell of media pushback .
Now , when the McCain team tries to spread this lie , the egos in the media see it as an attack on their integrity , because they are named accomplices if they do not push back .
Again , the ego of the media is the most important thing , and the McCain geniuses forgot it .
One small caveat - this is actual reporters at the Washington Post .
I have no doubt that Richard Cohen or one of the other defenders of the prevailing narrative , the Hiatt hacks , if you will , will no doubt attack Obama on the op - ed pages for not visiting the troops .
It will probably happen in October , right before the election , when it will be too difficult to re-fight the lie again .
That is just how they roll .
Government experts and lawmakers clashed at a hearing Tuesday over the safety of a chemical used in plastic baby bottles , as the science indicating health risks seemed not conclusive enough to meet the burden of proof required for a U.S. ban .
The chemical , bisphenol A , or BPA , makes plastic hard and shatterproof and helps prevent corrosion in cans .
It is used in hundreds of consumer products , including plastic baby bottles , plastic food containers and soda cans .

news Rogers Bans Some Existing Customers From Buying iPhones
As we ’ve pointed out many times before , Rogers boasts an exceptional brand of contempt for its non-business wireless customers , but the launch of Apple ’s desperately anticipated iPhone has exposed a whole set of new lows for the Toronto - based company .
Due to a breathtakingly boneheaded policy put in place by the company ’s National Planning Department , existing customers currently under a Rogers contract and who have upgraded their handset within the year are prohibited from purchasing an iPhone .
At all .
Well , that ’s only partly true .
They can buy an iPhone if they cancel their current contract , pay the early cancellation penalty fee ( $ 20 per month left on the contract to a maximum of $ 400 ) , and then sign up to a new contract , which includes an additional $ 35 activation fee .
Customers are n’t even allowed to keep their previous phone number , as number porting is only available when transferring carriers — so , to retain a number with an iPhone , a customer would have to sign up for a brand new account with Rogers subsidiary Fido .
Reportedly , Rogers sales reps have also been specifically instructed not to waive any fees whatsoever in relation to iPhone purchases .
Essentially , a customer under contract who replaced a stolen or broken handset less than a year ago is now locked out of switching to an iPhone until the current contract runs out .
This is especially problematic now because the only semi-reasonable data package is an offer that expires at the end of August .
The limited - time offer was implemented in response to a massive level of criticism of Rogers ’ exorbitant data rates .
It was hoped that the Canadian debut of the device would force Rogers to offer rates and data packages more in - line with other countries , but when the plans were revealed in June , it was business as usual for the communications behemoth , which enjoys a GSM monopoly in Canada ( the iPhone only works on GSM networks ) .
On July 9 , Rogers caved somewhat to the mountain of bad press and offered a $ 30 add - on for existing plans with a more generous monthly data cap of 6 GB .
That offer expires August 31 , and although Rogers spins it as a gift to “ early adopters , ” what that move did was get some better PR points for the company while drawing a whole bunch of fence - sitters into iPhone contracts who otherwise might not have purchased one .
As with anything Rogers , the policy to lock - out potential iPhone customers until they finish a current contract seems suspicious : those consumers are still likely to buy an iPhone later , which effectively extends the lock - in period and employs the higher , extremely lucrative rate plan .
Rogers has also not stated if they will allow new iPhone customers to upgrade as new generations of the iPhone are released over the contract term , or what options will be available as iPhones are lost , broken , or stolen ( they claim that they can replace it with a phone ; just not another iPhone ) .
The company has clearly indicated that they might start blocking any non-Rogers , unlocked , or modded iPhones on their network , however .
Wireless carriers have always subsidized handsets in order to appear cheaper for the customer ; the longer the contract , the cheaper the phone .
That still does n’t explain why Rogers wo n’t allow handset upgraders to pay out the remaining contract period and / or handset subsidy in order to get an iPhone , especially since the purchase of an iPhone brings thousands of guaranteed dollars to the company over the 36 - month lock - in .
In related news , Rogers ’ wireless sales , which make up 54 % of the company ’s revenue , jumped 12 % over the last quarter , netting $ 1.36 billion and 41,000 new subscribers .

Crackdown on anti-Bush protests
Thousands arrested in New York City
By Bill Van Auken
2 September 2004
The New York City Police Department ( NYPD ) has launched a harsh crackdown against anti-Bush protesters , arresting between 1,500 and 2,000 since demonstrations against the Republican National Convention began last Friday .
Cops carried out arbitrary mass arrests in different parts of the city on Tuesday , corralling hundreds in orange plastic netting — the latest police tool for suppressing the right to assembly — before handcuffing and loading them into jail buses .
Massed ranks of helmeted riot police swept down on various protests Monday .
While nearby at Madison Square Garden the Republicans praised each other for their “ compassionate conservatism , ” in separate instances of police brutality , cops beat teenagers , threw an elderly man to the ground and tackled women on concrete sidewalks .
Those taken into custody have been taken to a makeshift detention center set up in a dilapidated pier on the Hudson River that had been used as bus garage .
They have been held there under abysmal conditions — in some cases for 24 hours or more — in chain - link cages topped with razor wire .
The opening of the convention saw a sharp shift in tactics by the NYPD from what had been a relatively flexible approach to the main protest march on Sunday .
The participation of approximately half a million people in the march through Manhattan made a police crackdown politically and tactically inadvisable .
Faced with smaller numbers on the streets and acts of civil disobedience on Monday , the police carried out measures that appeared designed to silence Bush ’s political opponents and jail as many protesters as possible in order to curtail further demonstrations .
In most cases , the cops brought to bear by the 36,000 - member NYPD have outnumbered the protesters by at least 2 - to - 1 .
The New York Civil Liberties Union issued a statement saying it was “ concerned about the change in tone and tactics by the NYPD , ” and accusing police of making “ sweeping arrests that did not distinguish between lawful protest and unlawful protest . ”
Much of Manhattan remains under what approximates a state of siege , with the blocks around the Garden barricaded and filled with cops , the constant roar of police helicopters hovering overhead and columns of police in vans and on motorcycles racing continuously through the city ’s streets .
The city ’s billionaire Republican mayor , Michael Bloomberg , boasted of the mass arrests .
In a televised interview on Tuesday , Bloomberg declared , “ Yesterday you saw a bunch of people who said they were going to bring the city to its knees , and they did n’t .
They wanted to ruin people ’s time when they were here , and they did n’t do it . ”
In one of the most blatant acts of unprovoked repression Monday , police arrested some 200 pacifist demonstrators who had set off from Ground Zero at the former World Trade Center site in lower Manhattan in a march to Madison Square Garden .
Like most of the protests on Monday , the several hundred marchers , organized by the War Resisters ’ League and the School of Americas Watch , had no permit .
However , they negotiated a route and ground rules with the police , agreeing to stay on the sidewalk , stop for traffic lights and march two - abreast .
No sooner had the marchers stepped off the sidewalk to cross the street , then the police swept in with a sheet of orange netting , trapping some 200 people , including news reporters and bystanders .
Five busloads of protesters were carted away from the site .
Christopher Dunn , of the New York Civil Liberties Union , helped to negotiate the agreement with the cops .
“ They walked and they arrested them , ” Dunn told the press .
“ I ca n’t imagine what happened . ”
While police officials claimed the demonstrators violated the deal by walking in the street , Dunn insisted that the only ones stepping off the sidewalk were reporters and the police themselves .
A similar mass arrest took place later in the evening , when police confronted a group calling itself “ No RNC Street Party , ” which was marching down the sidewalk near Manhattan ’s Union Square .
Police swept in and forced them onto a blocked - off side street , where they were trapped .
Swept up in the arrest was an entire marching band and a street theater group known as “ Missile Dick Chicks . ”
Another demonstration , organized by welfare advocacy groups under the umbrella of Poor People ’s Economic Human Rights , attracted several thousand people to a rally at the United Nations , on Manhattan ’s East Side .
Again , protest organizers negotiated with the police , agreeing on a march route to Madison Square Garden .
When the march came within two blocks of the convention , entering a designated protest zone , the police suddenly intervened , wading into the crowd with night sticks and metal barricades , separating off the end of the march , beating people and pushing them down the block .
In the midst of the chaos a flying squad of plainclothes cops rode their scooters wildly into the crowd , hitting a number of marchers .
One of the cops fell , or was knocked off of his bike , as people tried to get out of the way , and was repeatedly kicked by a protester .
Police later arrested a 19 - year - old man from East Harlem Tuesday , charging him with assaulting a police officer .
Another confrontation took place in the early evening outside the New York Public Library near Bryant Park .
Police warned a group standing on the library steps that they would be arrested if they attempted to hang a banner they were carrying on the library .
When , instead , they unfurled it dozens of cops swarmed over the protesters , knocking them to the ground and arresting several .
As in the incident near Ground Zero , police moved in with the orange netting in what began as another attempt to trap hundreds of people for arrest , but backed off after the crowd left the scene .
In one of the oddest and least defensible arrests , cops collared Georgi Page , a 34 - year - old web producer from Harlem , who staged a one - woman protest outside the Hummer showroom on 11th Avenue in Manhattan , wearing a cardboard box fashioned to look like the bulky vehicle .
When a police officer asked her to leave , she refused , saying that she was not obstructing traffic or violating the law .
She was thrown into a police van and charged with disorderly conduct and “ parading without a permit . ”
The conditions under which the thousands of arrestees are being held sparked another protest on Tuesday morning outside Pier 57 at 15th Street on the West Side Highway .
The facility has been turned into a mass detention center that protesters have dubbed “ Guantánamo on the Hudson . ”
Lawyers for the jailed protesters have reported that their clients were brought to court covered with grime after being forced to sleep on the concrete floors covered with oil and chemicals from the buses that are normally parked in the three - story structure .
One woman had to be rushed to a hospital after the chemicals caused her to break out in rashes all over her body .
Transit union officials have confirmed reports that the facility was contaminated with asbestos as well as dangerous chemicals .
Those arrested are housed 100 each in separate pens , with just two portable toilets in each of these cages .
They have reportedly been subjected to verbal abuse by guards and denied food .
The National Lawyers Guild called a press conference to denounce the conditions at the detention center as a violation of basic democratic rights .
The organization cited the case of a pregnant woman who had been held overnight and given no food and of a woman with a broken foot who was denied medical treatment .
Other prisoners have been denied medications needed for chronic illnesses .
The police have also held the protesters incommunicado , denying them the right to speak with lawyers or to make phone calls .
Attorneys have reported that even when they have given the names of people who are detained , they have been refused access to them .
Some of those arrested have been held for more than 30 hours , violating a long - existing standard in the city that anyone detained must be produced within 24 hours or less .
For the most part , the protesters have been issued desk appearance tickets — akin to a ticket for a traffic violation — and released , but only after being held overnight or longer .
The transparent aim of the police is to instill fear in the protesters and intimidate them from continuing to stage street demonstrations .
Did you know that investing is the single most important thing you can do to have a safe financial future ?
The sooner you start , the better the chances of becoming rich , or at least financially stable .
I know , this might sound unrealistic , but there are more than 100 years of evidence from stock markets that confirms this statement .
And still , people do n’t have the right idea about investing .
A lot of people seem to think you can magically get rich with stocks and bonds quickly .
From our experience most people get wrong about investing is either :
a 24 - hour Wall Street mania where nervous traders make and lose millions while always yelling “ BUY !! BUY !! ” into a phone .
Investments are incredibly risky because the pundits always euphorically scream about the next financial apocalypse , whenever there is a dip in the market .
And you actually have many reasons to believe this .
Because of Hollywood and the sensational pundits on the news , we have come to believe that investing in stocks or bonds is something not suitable for an ordinary person .
And still , many of us do n’t even know how investing works .
This is the reason why we decided to create this guide , to reveal the truth about some of the myths about investing .
We will also focus on some of the most common topics you will come across when the investments are discussed :
How do Bonds work ?
Stock Basics
How to invest in your future – without bullshit .
The article is not going to be about the hottest stocks or bonds in the market .
If you are looking for something like that , we recommend you go on youtube , or listen to some cable news pundits .
Instead , we will highlight the basics of stocks and bonds and how you can use them to achieve financial freedom .
How do Bonds Work ?
Bonds are essentially a loan you give to the bank getting a fixed amount of interest in return .
We will talk about :
Bond Basics
Bond Positives
Bond Negatives
Bond Basics
Bonds , in a nutshell , look like this :
You decide to buy a 1 - year bond , and you agree to give $ 100 to a bank , and at the end of the year , you will get $ 102 .
The current rate for a 2 - year bond is at around 2 % .
With Bonds you can expect :
a guaranteed return
a smaller size of returns
they are very stable
So , who should invest in bonds , knowing these facts ?
Basically , anyone , who wants to know the exact amount of returns they ’ll be getting .
It does n’t matter if you are old or young , if you prefer stable investments with guaranteed returns , buying bonds is the right choice for you .
Not all people like the risk and volatility of a stock market and this is perfectly fine .
Bond Positives
You know exactly how much return you will get when buying a bond
You can choose the time period you want a bond for – it can be a year , 2 years , 5 years and so on .. )
Longer time periods have higher returns
Bonds are very stable , government bonds even more so .
The situation where you ’d lose money on a government bond is if the government defaulted on its loans .
However , this does n’t happen – the government just prints more money .
Bond Negatives
As they are very stable , the returns on a great bond are much smaller than on a great stock .
When investing in bonds your money is illiquid , meaning you ca n’t withdraw your assets fort he period of time unless you pay a substantial penalty for taking it out early .
Bonds are hard to buy and sell as individuals as opposed to stocks .
Stocks
What does it mean to own a stock ?
When you own a company ’s stock you essentially own a part of that company .
This is also the reason why stocks are also called equity .
With stocks we will focus on :
Stock basics
How to pick the right stock
Research resources
Stock positives and negatives
Stock Basics
As the stock means ownership in the company , if the company does well , so does your stock .
You can buy and sell stocks at any time using a broker or a website such as TD Ameritrade or E*Trade .
When learning about stocks a lot of people start thinking about questions like :
“ What stock should I pick ? ”
“ Is this company a good investment ? ”
“ Is the stock price too expensive ? ”
But first things first : take it slowly .
This is very important .
Before you make any sort of investment , you should also understand how to make the correct decision – what stock to buy .
Furthermore , it is also crucial to be self - aware and not spend too much money on stocks .
They are still volatile , and if you will risk too much , you will stress out more and the likelihood of making a bad decision and selling the stocks at the wrong time will be increased .
How to pick the right stock
The easiest way to narrow down your stock options is to think about companies you already know .
Think about some of the companies you use in your everyday life and write down 15 of them .
Think about everything you do :
Food : Wendy ’s , Whole Foods , Subway
Clothes : GymShark , Zara , Etsy
Services : Amazon , AT&T
Technology : Microsoft , Apple , Samsung
Entertainment : Disney , Netflix , Warner Brothers
Transportation : BMW , Nissan , Uber
Now instead of looking at all the possible options , you can make your pick out of the 15 companies you chose .
Keep in mind – a good company does n’t always translate to good stock .
Before you start trading a stock you should make a deeper analysis .
Do n’t just buy the stock because you like the company or it has good service !
It is also recommendable to first read a guide about how to invest in the stock market with success .
Before buying a stock you should look at 5 different stock aspects :
Trends :
Are company sales increasing or decreasing ?
Also check the sales from 2 years , 5 years ago , etc . .

You can find all of the information online for free .
You should research the company as much as possible .
If you find any doubts about any of the company aspects , you should avoid buying their stock .

US environmental official admits White House influenced emissions decision
Elana Schor in Washington – guardian.co.uk ,
Monday May 19 2008 – 11.30 pm BST / 6.30 pm ET

A top official at the US Environmental Protection Agency confirmed that the agency denied strong carbon emissions limits proposed by California after the White House intervened , it emerged today .
But the official , who resigned from the agency earlier this month , told congressional investigators that he was instructed not to reveal whether George Bush or other White House officials played a personal role in the controversial blockage of California ’s pollution rules .
The EPA associate deputy administrator , 31 - year - old Jason Burnett , told the oversight committee of the House of Representatives that agency chief Stephen Johnson was prepared to approve a waiver allowing California to set strong limits on greenhouse gas emissions .
Trained staff members at the EPA had unanimously advised Johnson that US clean air laws supported California ’s plan and that the Bush administration should support it .
Burnett agreed , according to an interview summary the oversight panel released today .
He told Congress that “ all EPA recommendations that I am aware of ” ¦ were either supporting granting the full waiver or granting partial waiver ” .
However , Johnson shifted from support for at least a partial waiver in the autumn of last year to a denial of California ’s request in December .
The state would have required a 30 % reduction in tailpipe emissions from cars by 2016 , dealing a blow to auto industry profits .
When asked whether Johnson spoke with the White House before his position changed , Burnett said : “ I believe the answer is yes . ”
Bush aides also had “ input into the rationale ” for the December denial , according to Burnett .
California has sued the Bush administration to force an acceptance of its environmental standards , with 16 other states waiting in the wings to join in the new emissions limits .
During the investigation into EPA ’s denial – which marked the first time in 40 years that the agency blocked a rule approved by the state – congressional aides examined 27,000 pages of documents and took testimony from eight agency officials .
“ Clearly the Bush administration at the highest levels killed the California waiver , ” one of the state ’s Democratic senators , Barbara Boxer , said in a statement .
“ The people of California and the other states have a right to know how this indefensible decision happened , and we demand that EPA and the Bush White House turn over the documents we have asked for immediately . ”
An EPA spokesman shrugged off today ’s congressional report as a retread .
“ Distraction - oriented , political tactics of the committee will not keep EPA from moving forward , tackling tough issues and putting into place the most health - protective standards ever , ” the spokesman told the Associated Press .
WASHINGTON  A majority of American voters say that the furor over the relationship between Senator Barack Obama and his former pastor has not affected their opinion of Mr. Obama , but a substantial number say that it could influence voters this fall should he be the Democratic presidential nominee , according to the latest New York Times / CBS News Poll .
At the same time , an overwhelming majority of voters said candidates calling for the suspension of the federal gasoline tax this summer were acting to help themselves politically , rather than to help ordinary Americans .
Mr. Obama ’s rival for the Democratic nomination , Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton , has made the suspension of the gas tax a centerpiece of her campaign in recent days .
In the survey , taken in the days leading up to the primaries on Tuesday in Indiana and North Carolina , Americans were divided over the merits of the gasoline - tax suspension , which has also been backed by the presumptive Republican nominee , Senator John McCain , and condemned by Mr. Obama as political gimmickry .
Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama spent the final Sunday before the two primaries debating the gas - tax holiday and other issues on morning talk shows and in events across Indiana .

Advertisement Spain is experiencing its worst drought in 40 years .
Climate experts warn that the country is suffering badly from the impact of climate change and that the Sahara is slowly creeping north - into the Spanish mainland .
Yet in Spain itself there is little consensus about what is to be done .
Indeed , such is the disagreement that journalists and politicians alike are calling it " water wars " .
A farmer and politician , Angel Carcia Udon , said : " Water arouses passions because it can be used as a weapon , a political weapon , just as oil is a political weapon . "
And water in Spain has set region against region , north against south and government against opposition .
When the city of Barcelona nearly ran out of water earlier this year , the fountains were switched off and severe restrictions were introduced .
The government of Catalonia pleaded for water to be transferred from rivers like the Ebro - causing a furious row between the regions .
Instead , the city shipped in millions of litres of water from France and accelerated work on the giant desalination plant on the edge of Barcelona , which promises to provide 180,000 cubic metres of water a day .
Parched land But Barcelona is not alone in its insatiable thirst .
Apart from the far north , the entire country is suffering , especially the parched areas on the Mediterranean coast , from Catalonia , down through Valencia , Alicante , Murcia and Almeria .
Mr Udon , whose Popular Party ( PP ) believes in transferring water around the country , said : " It 's incomprehensible that , in one country , there is an excess of water in one place and a deficit in another .
The landscape of eastern Spain looks more parched than usual " Even more incomprehensible is that they expect us to use water from desalination plants , which is expensive and would force us to raise prices . "
But when the present PSOE Socialist government of Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero got into power in 2004 , they cancelled all the PP 's plans to send water from the north - west to the arid zones of the south - east .
Instead , the government is building more desalination plants , adding to the more than 900 already in Spain - the largest number in any one country outside the Middle East .
They are working night and day at the one at Llobregat , close to Barcelona airport .
The general manager , Juan Compte Costa , assured me that it was the most cost - effective and energy - efficient desalination plant yet .
Environmental row Asked how much alternative energy it will use , he replied : " In this plant alone , we are talking about solar energy providing about one million kilowatt hours ( kWh ) a year , against the total consumption of 180 million kWh , ie less than 0.5 % . "
The Spanish government is building more desalination plants
He added that there simply were not enough sun hours in Spain to energise a plant of this size .
The opposition party , supported by some environmentalists , say that the ambitious desalination plant programme , with its huge energy needs , will only add to the amount of CO2 produced , which in turn will add to global warming and thereby increase Spain 's problems .
The government , supported by other environmentalists ( even the Greens disagree about water in Spain ) , argue that the expense and ecological damage caused by rerouting of rivers is far worse .
The desalination plant in Barcelona will not be ready in time to avert a water crisis again in Barcelona next spring , if the rains fail again this winter .
It is just as well that the government of Catalonia has instructed all schools to add water conservation to the school curriculum .
" You must not leave the tap on for too long because water will be wasted and we wo n't have enough water in Barcelona , " five - year - old Teresa solemnly told me on the way to the playground area in one of the city 's parks .
Her friend , seven - year - old Carmen , then added : " If you want to shower in hot water , then you must collect the cold water that comes out first in a bucket and use it later to water the plants . "
And from eight - year - old Juan : " If you do n't have water , there are lots of things you can't do .
You can't live without it .
Without water we can't survive . "
At least Spain has produced one good thing in this , the year of drought - some of the most environmentally aware children in Europe .

Prince Charles has warned that the adoption of genetic modification in farming has set the world on course for " the biggest disaster , environmentally , of all time " .
In an outspoken assault on GM crops , the prince accused unnamed " gigantic corporations " of " conducting a gigantic experiment with nature , and the whole of humanity , which has gone seriously wrong " .
In an interview given to the Telegraph at the Castle of Mey , a Windsor family seat in Caithness , the heir to the throne reiterated his antipathy to industrialised agriculture .
He delivered a vividly - worded prediction that small farmers across the globe would be forced from their land into city slums through companies planting GM crops .
" We [ will ] end up with millions of small farmers all over the world being driven off their land into unsustainable , unmanageable , degraded and dysfunctional conurbations of unmentionable awfulness , " the prince said .
" What we should be talking about is food security , not food production - that is what matters , and that is what people will not understand .
" And if they think it 's somehow going to work because they are going to have one form of clever genetic engineering after another , then count me out because that will be guaranteed to cause the biggest disaster environmentally of all time . "
As evidence , the prince cited environmental problems in countries which have used GM crops to increase food production .
He said he had seen first hand the result of over - demand on irrigation systems and the water table in Punjab because of the hybrid seeds and grains used .
" Look at Western Australia , " he added .
" Huge salinisation problems .
I have been there , seen it ... some of the excessive approaches to modern argriculture . "
Prince Charles first set out his opposition to GM crops in 1998 when he said that " genetic modification takes mankind into realms that belong to God , and to God alone " .
His latest remarks are likely to set him against the British government , which has approved 54 trials of GM crops since 2000 , the latest being a trial by the chemical giant BASF to test a blight - resistant potato at a site in East Yorkshire .
However , Europe is proving more resistant to the spread of GM crops than the rest of the world , and no GM crops are being grown commercially in the UK .
Almost all the trials to have taken place in Britain have been disrupted by protesters .
Meanwhile , the area planted with GM crops worldwide has soared almost 70 - fold in 10 years to 114 m hectares .
That is predicted to double by 2015 , according to a report published in February by the International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-biotech Applications , a GM industry group .
Greenpeace believes the spread of GM crops has been " a disaster " and that they " pose a serious threat to biodiversity and our own health " .
As Bob Barr , a former Republican , reignited his political career by taking the Libertarian presidential nomination at the party ’s convention in Denver on Sunday , the political career of Mike Gravel came to a close .
It was the former Democrat ’s second loss of a party ’s presidential nomination in a single year .
“ I just ended my political career , ” Mr. Gravel said at the party ’s convention .
“ From 15 years old to now , my political career is over , and it ’s no big deal . ”
Mr. Gravel , 78 , spent 12 years in the United States Senate from Alaska , pursuing even then an anti-war agenda and railing against the military industrial complex .
His tenure was marked by dramatic procedural actions criticizing the Vietnam War , but his claim to fame came when he tried to release the Pentagon Papers by reading them on the Senate floor .
He also waged a one - man filibuster — ended when his colleagues invoked cloture — against the military draft in 1971 .
He lost his seat in 1980 , after a contentious Democratic primary .
When he began his bid for the Democratic nomination last year , he said he was only doing it to promote his National Initiative for Democracy , which would allow citizens to vote on and enact federal legislation .
But then came the first debate , when Mr. Gravel announced that his seven fellow contenders “ frighten me . ”
He also complained that he felt like a “ potted plant , ” and asked Senator Barack Obama , “ Who do you want to nuke ? ”
Debates provided key exposure for Mr. Gravel , especially since seeing him in person was so difficult : citing security concerns , he refused to release a schedule of his public appearances .
So his campaign faced a major setback when networks began barring him from the Democratic cattle calls .
Mr. Gravel said the corporate networks were censoring him because he opposed going to war in Iran .
“ I ’m the only one talking about the military industrial complex , ” he said in October , shortly after he did not receive an invitation to a MSNBC debate .
“ You ’d have an interest in cutting my voice out before it become broadly known . ”
Mr. Gravel then started holding his own “ alternative debates , ” aided by a digital video recorder .
When he wanted to respond to a question in a real debate , or argue with another candidate , all he had to do was pause the tape and talk — without facing a rebuttal or follow - up .
He found his platform , though , on YouTube , where his videos became instant cult classics .
One of his first hits had Mr. Gravel staring at the camera , silently , for more than a minute before throwing a stone in a lake and walking away .
Then there was his psychedelic folk - rap , “ Power to the People vs. Give Peace a Chance , ” which featured the white - haired candidate reciting a slam poem in front of flashing , retro animation .
In March , nearly two years after beginning his bid for the Democratic nod , Mr. Gravel announced that he was changing his registration to Libertarian and that he would pursue the party ’s nomination .
Sunday ’s balloting ended that aspiration , but during his campaigns , Mr. Gravel did win over one key figure : Obama girl .
“ You should drop your crush on Obama , ” he serenaded the star of the satirical video in a more recent offering by the comedy group Barely Political .
“ You oughta know that you ’re off the chain . ”
“ Six - foot - two from Alaska , I could give that a shot , ” she replied .
“ M.C. Gravel - ah hella - copter up in hiz - house , ” he rapped .
Just not the White House .
Mr. Gravel could not be reached on Tuesday for comment .
But in an e-mail message to supporters , Mr. Gravel ’s campaign announced that he would continue to promote his federal referendum initiative , as well as two books he co-wrote .
“ The Kingmakers , ” billed as “ an analysis and polemic on corporate media and how it distorts our political dialogue , including Mike ’s own campaign , ” and “ A Political Odyssey , ” a story of Mr. Gravel ’s career , are both scheduled to be published this summer .
Correction : June 2 , 2008
This post originally overstated the impact of Mr. Gravel ’s filibuster against the military draft in 1971 .
It did not lead directly to the compromise that let the draft expire in 1973 .

Hi ,
Not sure if this is or is not the ' norm ' but I just received my brand new iPhone here in the UK and once it had been activated on iTunes I found that the home screen ( the screen you can personalise with a photo ) already had a photo set against it !!!!
It would appear that someone on the production line was having a bit of fun - has anyone else found this ?
These are the photo's :
Those familiar with cable news television understand that several programs - even entire networks - broadcast from a particular bias .
Keith Olbermann 's COUNTDOWN on MSNBC is left leaning , as is Dan Abrams ' VERDICT .
Olbermann has become famous for his highly crafted " Special Comments " which take aim at conservatives from George W. Bush to Rudolf Giuliani .
CNN has Glenn Beck and Lou Dobbs - both of whom use vitriol to attack various factions of the political world .
Beck goes after so - called liberals .
Dobbs is an equal opportunity attacker who assaults the Bush administration , members of Congress and ethnic groups from his prejudiced perspective .
FOX has an entire network , with anchors like Bill O'Reilly and Sean Hannity , who routinely lambaste the left .
Each of these pundits , or performers , are known for their ideological leanings .
Those who watch their programs do so presupposing the bias they will see .
Until recently , it had seemed that most of the clearly biased shows on cable news television had been publicly outed as leaning left or leaning right .
But on Friday , viewers learned there was yet another conservative Republican show , as vitriolic as FOX , airing nightly on CNN .
That show is Election Center , hosted by former NBC performer , Campbell Brown .
Election Center , which began airing last January with original anchor John Roberts , is billed as " the network 's daily examination of news from the campaign trail that combines CNN 's unrivaled field reporting and analysis with state - of - the - art broadcasting technology . "
It might be that providing " unrivaled reporting and analysis " on a daily basis was the original intent of CNN when Election Center first aired with John Roberts .
Roberts does n't conflate reporting with agenda .
However , CNN chose a less balanced and more ideological path for the show when it brought on conservative Bush supporter , Campbell Brown , as Election Center 's new anchor .
If Brown 's conservative leanings were n't all that obvious in the beginning , that all changed on Friday when Brown and CNN Headline News anchor , Erica Hill , virulently mocked the House Judiciary Committee for holding a hearing on impeachment .
After Brown and Hill 's searing attack on the Democrats , any sense of legitimacy Brown had tried to muster instantly fell away .
Because of Brown and Hill 's over - the - top trashing of the Congressional impeachment hearing , CNN's Election Center has devolved into the lowest form of " spin . "
It 's lost all credibility .
Witness for yourselves ( in video and text ) the slanted performance by CNN anchors , Brown and Hill , on a show that advertises its " unrivaled field reporting and analysis . "
C. Brown :
You might have thought there was big news on Capitol Hill today .
Democrats were talking about impeaching the president .
But actually it was all just stagecraft .
And Erica
Hill is here .
Tell us about this piece of Kabuki theatre .
Erica E. Hill : Oh and Campbell , theatre it was .
Today 's House Judiciary Committee Hearing was officially billed as " an examination of executive power and its constitutional limitations . "
And from the beginning it was pretty clear this was all just stagecraft in what one Republican lawmaker deemed impeachment light .
The Democratic leadership made it clear impeachment is not on the table at this hearing today for two reasons : not only is there not enough time left in President Bush 's term but also they know any impeachment hearings at this point could cause a major backlash against the Party come November .
So if you can't impeach , why not vent ?
And that is exactly what they did .
Take a listen .
( Democratic Congress members denounce George W. Bush .
Erica
Hill mocks rules established for the Hearing ... )
C. Brown : ( giggling )
Oooh that 's a good one .
Who knew ?
Alright so this is really just stagecraft - not to mention a real waste of taxpayer money and Congress ' time .
E. Hill : ( mocking ) A waste of our money ?
C. Brown : Did any Republicans even bother to show up for it ?
E. Hill : Actually a few did .
Most Republican lawmakers boycotted the hearing but a few were there and those who did attend as you can imagine were downright disgusted .
(... Republican Congressmen Lamar Smith and Trent Franks denounce Democrats and the Hearing ... )
E. Hill :
Well it turns out Representative Lamar Smith was right .
There was no impeachment hearing that came out of it .
As for the President today - clearly not too worried about this Hearing .
He was in Peoria , Illinois , as you can see here - kissin ' babies , smilin ' - taking pictures - not a care in the world .
Check out that guy [ a baby pictured with President Bush ] with his little shades on .
Cute .
C. Brown : Cute baby .
E. Hill : I can't get my kid to wear them .
C. Brown : ( approving hand gesture and smile )
And there 's the President .
Good stuff tonight !
Erica Hill - as always , thanks .
Undercover reporting from Zimbabwe is a risky business .
Add to the mix a close encounter with one of President Mugabe 's most feared supporters and , as Ian Pannell discovered , it becomes a brief glimpse of the terror that many people in the country are living through .
A presidential run -off election is to be held on 27 June 2008 " We would like to apologise for the late release of results , this was due to the rigging process which was more difficult than we anticipated . "
This joke was being passed around on mobile phones the last time I was in Zimbabwe .
It was early April and the country felt as though it was on the brink of historic change .
But I have just returned from another visit and this time the atmosphere could not be more different .
Sinister gangs
Many people have been arrested , more than 60 opposition activists have been murdered , thousands have been beaten , and tens of thousands of people have been driven from their homes .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
People have learned to live very different lives .
They talk in code and use passwords to communicate with friends .
Anyone who has been actively involved in opposition politics can be assumed to be a target of the sinister gangs which come at night , dragging people from their beds for a savage beating or sometimes worse .
There are days when it feels that everyone is hiding something , running from something , planning or plotting something .
The vast majority of the violence over the last two months has been in the countryside .
We left Harare and headed east towards Manicaland , a lush , fertile , province whose rolling fields give way to mountains on the Mozambique border .
The areas that have seen most of the violence are those which have historically voted for Zanu - PF but which switched sides in the last election .
Manicaland is one of those places .
We knew that hundreds of opposition supporters had been forced from their homes in a brutal campaign of retribution .
Face - to - face
A source told us of a site where 400 men , women and children were in hiding .
The area was thick with stories of ongoing violence and we knew that the militias , the military and the widely - feared war - veterans were active here .
After 30 minutes of driving along a fairly deserted road , we pulled over to wait for our contact .
That was when we encountered Joseph Chinotimba .
Joseph Chinotimba is deputy - leader of the war veterans association
He was not our contact .
Joseph Chinotimba is the deputy leader of the Zimbabwe National Liberation War Veterans Association and perhaps the most feared member of a group that has become synonymous with the worst excesses of violence in Zimbabwe in the last eight years .
His car blocked ours .
He got out with three other men , striding towards us , wearing a T - shirt with two Kalashnikovs and Robert Mugabe 's face printed on it .
We were in trouble .
His eyes were unflinching , a large , brooding man , full of hatred , smelling of alcohol and full of threats .
He leaned into the car , demanding to know who we were , where we were from , what we were doing , where we were going .
" We know what you are up to , " he said and he paused , as if waiting for a confession .
" There are journalists here you know . "
Still no response from us .
Joseph Chinotimba is a thug of a man who has acted with impunity for many years , and it was only fast and fluid talking by two South African colleagues we were travelling with that persuaded him to leave us alone .
I will never quite believe that he really bought what felt like a terribly flimsy cover story about travelling to see friends , but he did eventually let us pass .
It was a frightening few minutes , a brief glimpse of the terror that many people in Zimbabwe are living through .
Voter intimidation
We did eventually meet our contact and drove on through many police road blocks to the people we had come to see .
We were taken to a run-down holiday camp which was now home to hundreds of people who had been forced out of their village for voting " wrongly " .
One thing has not altered ... people 's desire for change
That was not their word but the one used by the thugs who attacked them .
Time and again we heard that same charge being levelled against people : " You voted wrongly and we 're going to punish you . "
I told our contact that we would only be 20 minutes here .
" Ten would be better , " he said , " it 's not safe here . "
And actually 10 minutes was enough time to hear not just what had happened to them but also what they would do about it .
The atmosphere in the country may have changed , the violence and intimidation is systematic and brutal and people are living different lives ... but one thing has not altered and that is people 's desire for change .
Fear yet defiance I have spoken to people with deep gouged wounds in their buttocks and their feet , broken limbs , burnt down homes , even the bereaved .
Almost all are scared but they are also defiant .
Robert Mugabe 's thugs may well have over - stepped the mark and actually stiffened people 's resolve .
One woman who had lost everything was emphatic .
She told me that her beating had made her stronger .
" It is my certificate , " she said , like some perverse badge of distinction .
Now she would go and use it to vote again for change .

It 's easy to take for granted the 3G iPhone 's launch at this point .
After all , Steve said it was " coming later this year , " as did a number of prominent mobile executives .
And then there 's been the barrage of carrier announcements , many in international markets that use UMTS and have zero support for the iPhone as we know it today .
But the fact of the matter is we 've had very little to go on by way of material evidence -- until now .
We have it from a reliable source that a version of the 3G iPhone 's firmware has been released -- possibly for carrier partners currently field - testing the device -- and has since been dissected .
While nothing is ever guaranteed , in combing through the raw data , we think we got more than enough information on the low - level hardware and drivers that run the device to make some informed conclusions about what we can expect : quad - band GSM support ( as we currently have ) , A - GPS ( as we 'd already gotten from another source ) , and tri-band UMTS / HSDPA -- which would make the new i Phone (s ) 3G - capable in just about every market in the world .
Hardware details after the break .
We 're through the looking - glass , people !
About 40 people had to be evacuated from their homes A London house at the centre of an explosion which left one man dead was targeted by vandals hours earlier , police said .
Officers were initially called after reports of a gas explosion in Stanley Road , South Harrow , on Wednesday night .
A purple liquid was poured through the letterbox of house about 10 hours before , which police say " may well be " linked to the blast .
A girl aged 17 was probably the target of the attack , detectives believe .
The dead man has been identified as 26 - year - old businessman Emmad Qureshi .
Two others were injured in the explosion , a teenage girl , who suffered serious burns , and a 26 - year - old man .
Both remain in hospital .
Gas explosion ' unlikely '
Two houses were completely destroyed and a third house was affected as a result of the blast , which detectives say is being treated as suspicious .
Officers now believe the explosion occurred at house number 21 , where the girl lived .
The mysterious liquid was poured through the house 's letterbox , police said .
Mr Qureshi lived next door at number 23 and the injured man was visiting him .
Det Ch Insp Colin Sutton said : " We still have n't ruled out a gas explosion but experts say it is unlikely to be the cause . "
The morning of the explosion , a local resident had complained about a gang of teenage girls gathered outside the house .
Nearly 40 people have been moved to temporary accommodation Mr Sutton said detectives were looking into the complaint along with the letterbox incident .
" It was a liquid substance and it was purple in colour .
" A strong line of inquiry for us at the moment is the dispute , this call at the address and of course the substance put through the letterbox .
" There may well be a connection between this liquid and the cause of the explosion that happened . "
He said the disturbance was reported on Wednesday morning and the liquid was poured between 0900 BST and 1100 BST .
' Targeted attack '
He added the liquid was not reported to them until after the blast and that experts are yet to determine what it was .
The injured girl probably knew the teenagers who caused the disturbance , Mr Sutton said .
" They are obviously people she knows , who were there to do her some harm ... it ( the attack ) was targeted . "
Mr Qureshi's body was removed from the scene by London Fire Brigade on Thursday night .
About 40 people who live in Stanley Road have been taken to temporary accommodation as recovery work continues .
Harrow Council said the road may not reopen for five or six days .
The sound of the explosion could be heard in Northwood , more than five miles away .

" This is due to an unintended change in data that was introduced in an earlier patch , data which controls the so - called morph values associated with character models and the size of their respective body parts .
Jeffs was on the FBI 's Ten Most Wanted list at the time of his arrest in 2006 Warren Jeffs , the jailed leader of a US polygamist sect , has been indicted on charges of child sexual assault in the state of Texas .
Five of his followers also face charges .
Jeffs was convicted last year of being an accomplice to rape and is currently in prison in Arizona .
In April , US officials removed 416 children from the sect 's ranch after receiving a report of sexual abuse .
A Texas court later overturned the decision to remove the children .
It said the state had overstepped its authority because of the lack of evidence about widespread sexual abuse .
Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott said he hopes to extradite Jeffs , who was convicted by a Utah court last November of conspiracy to rape after forcing a 14 - year - old girl to marry her cousin .
The Texas Grand Jury now believes it has the evidence to press charges against Jeffs and four other unnamed men of sexually assaulting girls under the age of 17 .
Another follower has been charged with three counts of failing to report allegations of child abuse .
Self - imposed fast Jeffs is currently awaiting trial in Arizona on four counts of being an accomplice to sexual conduct with a minor , stemming from the marriages of two girls .
Mr Abbott did not release the names of the five other men charged but said there " will be an aggressive attempt to apprehend them . "
" The indictments issued today are part of an ongoing and continuing criminal investigation , " Mr Abbott said .
Jeffs , 52 , is the head of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints , a breakaway sect of Mormonism that supports polygamy .
The 10,000 - strong sect , which dominates the towns of Colorado City in Arizona , and Hildale , Utah , split from the mainstream Mormon church more than a century ago .
Willie Jessop , a church member and spokesman , said members were shocked by the indictments .
" As soon as we know who they 're looking for , we 'll try to face it , we believe in our innocence , " Mr Jessop told The Associated Press .
While in prison , Jeffs has been treated in an infirmary for a self - imposed fast and was moved to a hospital earlier this month after he was found convulsive and feverish in his cell .

When I first became a feminist , back in the 1960s , I thought the male ways of life were the gold standard , the way life was meant to be .
Not men per se - I did n't like the fact they never seemed to see their children and did n't engage with their feelings in the way women did - but it was the way they lived their lives that I envied .
Unlike women , who were tied to the kitchen sink by their apron strings , enmeshed in childcare from sun-up to sun-down without the time or scope to advance their own careers and intellectual pursuits , men were free of all these onerous responsibilities .
They were free to pursue intellectual goals , to work , to succeed , above all to be leaders of the world .
I believed , along with so many others , that women , deep down ( or not so deep down ) , wanted to do all that as well .
We believed we were prevented from doing so only because men , and the sexist world they created , prevented us .
They kept us out of the club because otherwise their power base would be threatened , and if women did n't stay at home with the kids , ready with the supper , slippers and sherry , then their world would be a much poorer place .
I remember writing in early editions of Spare Rib , the magazine I started and which became a central focus of the feminist movement , that it was " only a question of time " before women scaled the ladder of economic success and power and took their place alongside men in the boardroom .
And indeed , as opportunities for women increased , we did start to shine in the classroom .
So much so that , in recent years , education authorities have started to worry that boys are being neglected in favour of girls .
Girls have started to outperform boys at GCSE and A - levels : they get more places in university and better degrees .
In the U.S. between 1969 and 2000 , male undergraduates increased by 39 per cent , whereas female ones increased by 157 per cent .
The trend continues beyond education and into the workplace .
In their early 20s , recent reports show , women are actually out - earning men in many instances .
All this proved to me , and to other feminists , that biology in no way dictates your destiny .
In her book The Second Sex , Simone de Beauvoir says : " One is not born , but rather one becomes , a woman . "
I agreed .
We were all born equal : it was only what happened in the nurturing process that decided the differences between men and women .
And we women were all destined to become desperate housewives - desperate to break out of the rigid roles society had accorded us .
But things have n't turned out quite the way I thought they would .
A few years on from those glory days of academic success and professional achievement , women start dropping out of the working rat-race .
They reach middle management levels , then stop climbing .
By their early 30s , most women are earning less than men in almost every sphere of work .
By their mid-30s , with a child or two in tow , they 're electing not to return to work , or at least not full - time work .
Many are choosing to set up their own companies , where time management is their own business .
We may have had a female prime minister , but chief executives of FTSE - 100 companies are still almost invariably male .
So are women losing their edge , while men find theirs ?
Or is on - going discrimination making life for the working woman in modern British society so stressful that she has no option but to turn her back on it ?
Until recently , I have always assumed the latter .
Women are pushed out of top jobs when they become mothers by bosses unwilling to provide flexible working hours .
They 're pushed out because they can't stay late in the office , because they have to get home to relieve the childminder , because they have to take time off if a child is sick .
But a new book by Canadian academic Susan Pinker , called The Sexual Paradox , has forced me to have a rethink - - and a radical one at that .
In her intelligent , thoughtful and profoundly important work , Pinker takes us through the facts : tests of 15 - year - olds in 30 European countries show girls far outstripping boys in reading , writing and maths .
Girls ' early academic achievements have become so markedly better than their male counterparts that a 2006 economics study showed universities practising affirmative action for men .
As a pinker makes clear , it is not a problem with brains or ability that continues to keep women out of the boardroom .
" If you were to predict the future on the basis of school achievement , "
Pinker writes , " the world would be a matriarchy . "
And yet , of course , it is not .
Once women move on from school and into careers , men on average will soon overtake them , earning more money and running more shows .
In contrast , women are more likely to leave the workforce , usually to start a family , and to end up with lower pay and less authority if they go back to work .
Pinker is far too shrewd to discount the effects of sex discrimination or culture in affecting women 's career choices .
But she thinks these forces play only a small part .
She quotes a female Ivy League law professor as saying : " I am very sceptical of the notion that society discourages talented women from becoming scientists .
" My experience , at least from the educational phase of my life , is that the very opposite is true . "
No , if women are n't racing to the upper echelons of science , government and the corporate world despite decades of efforts to woo them , Pinker argues , then it must be because they are wired to resist the demands at the top of those fields .
Women , she says , care more about intrinsic rewards .
They have broader interests , they are more serviceoriented and are better at gauging the effect they have on others .
They are " wired for empathy " .
Crucially , she explains that these are n't learned traits , forced into them by a sexist society ; they 're the result of genes and hormones .

The trends begin in the uterus when men are exposed to higher levels of testosterone , driving them to be more competitive , assertive , vengeful and daring .
Girls , meanwhile , get a regular dose of oestrogen , which helps them read people 's emotions .
Then there 's prolactin , which , along with oxytocin , surges during pregnancy , breastfeeding and mothering .
Together , these hormones produce a " natural high " : tests have shown that female rats experience a greater rush of pleasure from being with their newborns than from cocaine .
What Pinker has done , in fact , is to have proved how and why girls are different from boys right from the womb , when they are pumped full of different hormones .
You can see these differences from very early on - and they cannot be " overridden " .
Nature wins over nurture every time .
I 've had many feminist friends who have relentlessly presented their tiny daughters with bright - red fire engines to play with , only to be aghast when they throw them aside in favour of a Barbie doll .
The converse is true for boys .
Above all , the hormones women receive in the womb mean that , by nature , they do not want to be manic , one - dimensional workhorses who invest all their energies in one thing : their job ( or hobby ) .
Overall , they are less extreme than men .
The social critic Camille Paglia once wrote : " There is no female Mozart because there is no female Jack the Ripper . "
Men are simply more variable - there are more really stupid ones and more very smart ones than women ; more extremely lazy ones and more who are willing to halfkill themselves with overwork .
Women , by contrast , are steadier , less risk - taking .
As a consequence , they live longer .
In other words , because of their biological make - up , most women want to limit the amount of time they spend at work and to find " inherent meaning " there , as opposed to domination - a goal which thrills men but leaves most women disenchanted .
As such , women 's biological make - up conflicts with making lots of money and rising through the ranks .
These , of course , are the sort of conclusions that used to make my feminist blood boil .
When I set out into the world as a working woman , I believed the quest for equality with men was a quest for the right to have the same life as a man : a full - time job ( an obsessive one at that ) , a fulltime hobby , a partner who really did split the child - care neatly down the middle , plenty of time for " me " to do whatever I wanted .
I did n't think sexual equality could actually mean something completely different - that is , the equality to live your life how you wanted , and to have society respect you equally for it .
The trouble is , of course , that in our money - obsessed society , the jobs and professions we look up to - and that so many envy or seek to emulate - are those that bring in a vast pay cheque ( while keeping you chained to your desk ) .
Our values , Pinker asserts , are based on the simple fact that the world of men ( i.e. success and drive ) is the correct model .
While society continues primarily to value skills that emphasise money as the only currency of success , the skills that women have will always be seen as second - rate - and women will be seen to be failing .
The tragedy is that it is women who end up paying the price for this misunderstanding .
Too many of us struggle on in jobs we do not like , simply because the fiscal rewards are seen as the marker of achievement .
I realise , of course , that there is a danger here of over - simplifying the debate : affording a home often requires two full - time incomes .
Yet , it is equally undeniable that all of the women whom Pinker spoke to who had decided to step off the career ladder - whether to devote more time to their children or to develop their own businesses - report far greater degrees of satisfaction .
What we need to do , she asserts , is to stop rating women according to men and accept that the sexes truly are different .
As I see it , this is both a relief and a sadness .
A relief because it explains the female drain from the workforce when women are in their 30s ; a sadness because too often those women are seen to have failed .
To make men and women genuinely equal , we have to accept and honour difference , not mark everyone 's scorecard according to the same set of standards .
I still firmly believe there are measures that Britain could and should take to make the workplace more female - friendly , or rather more family - friendly .
For most working mums I know , it 's attempting to juggle their boss 's demands with their children 's needs ( combined with most men's continued reluctance to shoulder an equal share of running a home ) that makes their lives so stressful .
There is still no escaping the fact that , as a society , Britain lags far behind the rest of Europe in providing good , reliable childcare , which covers school holidays as well as those tricky hours between the end of the school day and the time that most offices close .
But I also believe that Pinker 's book should mark a watershed .
Sexual equality is all very well .
But real equality comes from making your own choices , not just following the well - trodden path towards careerism , simply because it has been signposted by society as the only path to success .
Liberation must always be about being yourself , not simply a clone .
The battle of the sexes is over .
Let the fight for women to be women commence .
Once upon a time , patriotism was a fairly simple thing .
It was tribal identification writ large , an emotional attachment to a people and their land .
In most of the world , where patriotism exists at all it ’s still like this — tribal patriotism , blood - and - soil emotionalism .
A different kind of patriotism emerged from the American and French revolutions .
While American patriotism sometimes taps into tribal emotion , it is not fundamentally of that kind .
Far more American is the sentiment Benjamin Franklin expressed : “ Where liberty dwells , there is my country ”
Thus , most Americans love their country in a more conditional way — not as a thing in itself , but insofar as it embodies core ideas about liberty .
It is in the same spirit that our Presidents and miltary officers and naturalizing citizens swear to defend , not the land or people of the United States but its Constitution — a political compact .
This is adaptive in many ways ; one of them is that tribal patriotism is difficult to nourish in a nation of immigrants .
In France , the ideology of the Revolution displaced tribal patriotism , just as it did in the U.S.
But the French , roiled by political instability and war , have never settled on a political unifying idea or constitutional touchstone .
Instead , French patriotism expresses a loyalty to French language and culture and history .
It replaces tribalism not with idealism but with culturism .
America and France are a marked contrast with , say , Denmark .
I chose Denmark at random from the class of civilized countries in which patriotism is still fundamentally tribal .
You do n’t become a Danish patriot by revering the constitution or culture of Denmark ; you become one by being a Dane .
Which partly means being a tribesman , connected to the Danish genepool , and partly means identifying with stories of past Danish heroism .
It has n’t been easy to find a fire - breathing Danish patriot for at least fifty years , though .
One of the effects of the terrible convulsions of the 20th century has been to discredit tribal patriotism .
Many people in Europe , not unreasonably , associate it with racism and Naziism and are suspicious of anything that smacks of immoderate patriotism .
This is less true in the U.S. and France , precisely to to the extent that their patriotism does not depend on tribal feeling .
Intense patriotism remains respectable in the United States precisely because it is primarily an ideological phenomenon not tied to blood and soil .
At its best ( a best which Americans achieve rather more often than most non-Americans understand ) it manifests as a high - minded determination to secure the blessings of liberty not just for tribal Americans but for every human being .
All this is fairly generally understood in the United States , and not controversial .
But American - style ideological patriotism has pathologies of its own .
These are less well understood , and at the bottom of some serious fissures in American political culture .
The left - wing American historian Howard Zinn once asserted that “ Dissent is the highest form of patriotism . ”
It is telling that this quote is often misattributed to Thomas Jefferson , the author of our Declaration of Independence , because it does sound like something Jefferson ( who famously opined that he thought the infant U.S. might require periodic revolutions every twenty years or so ) might actually have said — even though it is not in much doubt that he would reject almost every other feature of Zinn ’s politics .
Embedded deep in the American model of patriotism is the notion that it may be expressed by a passionate determination to reform or even completely upend American institutions in service to the ideals behind them .
This is not , as far as I can tell , true anywhere else in the world .
It would seem an alien idea even in modern France , where the excesses of the Jacobins irreversibly tainted that sort of fervor with blood .
I respect that tradition of patriotism by dissent because I am part of it .
I ’m both an American patriot and a libertarian anarchist .
I both love my country and would cheerfully abolish its government and many of its laws as soon as practically possible , in service of a higher loyalty to individual liberty ; “ Where liberty dwells , there is my country ” .
Even Americans who disagree strongly with my political stance have no real difficulty understanding how it is compatible with American patriotism .
But patriotism by dissent can take a much stranger turn .
An influential minority of Americans now behave as though loving their country as it might be in the imagined future , where everything they do n’t like about it is fixed , excludes loving their country as it actually is !
There was a flap in October 2007 when would - be Presidential candidate Barack Obama said that he stopped wearing an American - flag pin after 9/11 because he thought doing so had become a “ substitute for …true patriotism , which is speaking out on issues that are of importance to our national security . ”
In doing so , Obama ( who founded his candidacy on opposition to U.S. war policy in Iraq ) was clearly equating “ true patriotism ” with the patriotism of dissent .
Many Americans bridled at this , feeling that the real subtext of Obama ’s refusal to wear a flag pin expressed a lack of love for America as it actually is .
Matters were not helped when his wife Michelle responded to a string of primary victories by saying “ for the first time in my life , I ’m proud of my country ” ( emphasis added ) .
There was widespread feeling that one of the qualifications for anyone aspiring to live in the White House should be a rather less conditional love of country than this .
The question Barack and Michelle Obama ’s behavior raised is not a new one .
Can one reasonably be called an American patriot if , even recognizing its imperfections , one does n’t love America as it is ?
Obama , for his part , must have concluded that most Americans would answer “ no ” .
At least , I think that ’s what we can deduce from the fact that he started wearing a flag pin again — and whatever else can or cannot be said about Obama , he is extremely good at reading and reflecting the expectations of his audiences .
At its extreme , patriotism by dissent becomes a kind of anti-patriotism in which dedication to an imagined America - that - might - be produces actual , destructive hatred of America as it is and has been .
Unreasoning , extreme patriotism is sometimes called “ chauvinism ” , after the Napoleonic French officer Nicolas Chauvin ; for this kind of anti-patriotism I shall analogously coin the label “ chomskyism ” , after a well - known U.S. radical who appears to embody it .
Chomskyism is not a phenomenon entirely exclusive to left - wingers .
It can be found in the darker corners of the hard right as well , especially in the fever swamps that begin near Pat Buchanan and extend towards the “ white nationalist ” movement .
These people remain , however , distinct from actual neo -Nazis or fascists , who fail to be patriots of dissent because they have no investment at all in the American ideal of liberty .
But my choice of Noam Chomsky as an icon does reflect the fact that chomskyism is far more a phenomenon of the American left than of the American right .
It is near impossible to imagine a conservative presidential aspirant refusing to wear a flag pin , or explaining that refusal as Obama did .
On the other hand , what one might call a sub-clinical version of chomskyism is extremely common among mainstream left - liberals .
Many seem embarrassed by the symbols of patriotism , or incapable of expressing love for their country without feeling obligated to engage in a great deal of semi-ritualized breast - beating about its past and present flaws .
One may reasonably ask why this matters .
Is patriotism important ?
Supposing it is , to what extent is chomskyism really a problem ?
I will tackle those questions in a future post focused less on history and observation , and more on questions of ethics and values .
Just when we were finished telling you that the BlackBerry Thunder 's haptic touch screen keyboard was the greatest thing evar , it turns out that things may be a bit of a mess over in RIM development land .
According to one of Boy Genius ' sources , the BlackBerry Thunder is lagging far behind on development time and is " in no way shape of form market - ready . "
And that awesome keyboard ?
Not so awesome .
Reports are that it 's annoying to type on and the screen ripples when the touchscreen is pressed .
Meanwhile , UI response times are pretty bad , buttons do n't click right , and RIM 's new touch - and - drag method of selecting items is n't up to snuff .
In short , says BGR 's source , " Most of the people who have handled it thinks it 's a joke . "
We have n't seen the thing ourselves lately , but if this report is true , it looks like you 'll be waiting a while before you get your hands on a Thunder .
In the present book , I will go much further and argue that by this moment in time science has advanced sufficiently to be able to make a definitive statement on the existence or nonexistence of a God having the attributes that are traditionally associated with the Judeo - Christian - Islamic God .
This is an apt description of what to expect .
But it is also rather easy to present the core of Stenger 's case in the briefest possible terms as follows :
Hypothesize a God who plays an important role in the universe .
Assume that God has specific attributes that should provide objective evidence for his existence .
Look for such evidence with an open mind .
If such evidence is found , conclude that God may exist .
If such objective evidence is not found , conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that a God with these properties does not exist .
Essentially , this is the process around which Stenger organizes his book .
Again and again , we see none of the evidence that should be present if there was a god with the properties agreed upon by most Christians .
But this really is n't the most damning part of Stenger 's analysis .
Consistent with Dawkins and many other prominent authors , he finds that the evidence leads to the conclusion that no such god exists .
Simply put , " Indeed , Earth and life look just as they can be expected to look if there is no designer God . "
I enjoyed the book .
Stenger 's Ph.D. is in physics , so it was to be expected that he went more into that field than many others .
But I appreciated this perspective and found it a fitting complement to those from biology , anthropology , psychology , and other fields .
I read quite a bit on the subjects of atheism , Christian extremism , and politics .
I suppose I should write more book reviews here .
The problem is that writing an effective book review is quite a bit of work and reminds me too much of the sort of writing I do at my job .
You 'll have to make do with brief recommendations and mini-reviews .
One such recommendation is Victor J. Stenger 's God : The Failed Hypothesis
In introducing his book Stenger writes ,
