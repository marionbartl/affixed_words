The global recession has brought us a slew of numbers so large , with so many noughts attached , that it 's getting difficult to put them into any kind of perspective .
The Bank of England recently announced it was injecting up to £ 150 billion of new money into the British economy , an unimaginable amount - yet now we hear Barack Obama is proposing to splash out a further $ 1trn ( one trillion dollars ) to rescue Wall Street 's floundering institutions .
And even that 's not as much as Britain 's national debt has been recalculated at - £ 1.5 trn - following the classification of Lloyds and the Royal Bank of Scotland as public corporations .
Millions , billions , trillions - names most of us are familiar with , even if we can't specify the number of zeros .
In January , Zimbabwe printed a dollar note with a number containing 14 zeros , only to further deflate its currency a month later .
And it still does n't match the Hungarian National Bank in 1946 , which came up with the highest denomination banknote ever issued : a 100 quintillion ( 20 zeros ) peng note .
To make any sense of what 's going on ( and how bad things really are ) , you need a feeling for quite how big these numbers are .
So here 's a brief guide , from zero right up to the biggest of them all .
0 or zero
A relative newcomer on the mathematical scene , zero was n't recognised as a number in its own right until the Indians started exploring its properties in the seventh century AD ( they are also responsible for the other nine symbols we use for recording numbers , known as the Arabic - Hindu system ) .
Zero was introduced to Europe by the Italian mathematician Fibonacci in the 12th century - and the authorities were so suspicious of it that in 1299 the government of Florence banned its use .
The Indians ' invention of the number zero is directly related to their fascination with large numbers .
The Sanskrit saga Lalitavistara gives an account of Gautama Buddha , who is asked at one point to name all of the numbers up to those with 421 zeros .
A time - consuming task .
10
The base - 10 system we use today is a direct result of the fact we count on our 10 fingers ( the Simpsons , presumably , are working in base eight ) .
Other cultures were not so hooked on powers of 10 : the ancient Babylonians collected things in powers of 60 , and we see hangovers of their system of numbers in the modern world .
The fact that there are 60 minutes in an hour and 360 degrees in a circle is a relic of the Babylonians ' choice of base 60 .
The effect of putting zeros on the end of a Babylonian number is therefore even more devastating than on our modern decimal notation .
1,000,000 ( one million )
We really start to see the power of the Arabic - Hindu system coming into its own as we hit the big numbers .
The Romans had to keep on cooking up new letters every time their numbers got bigger - C for 100 , D for 500 , M for 1,000 - because they did n't have zeros to add on to the end .
To give a sense of how big a million is , 1 m seconds is just over 11 ½ days and if you laid 1 m pound coins end to end , they would stretch for 14 miles .
1,000,000,000 ( one billion )
In the UK , this number used to be called , simply , 1,000 million , while a billion was reserved for a million million ( a number with 12 zeros ) .
But pressure to standardise our numbers with the US drove Harold Wilson to announce in 1974 that any government mention of a billion would from then on mean a number with nine zeros .
If you really want someone to blame for the confusion over billions , however , it 's the French .
Throughout history , they have flip - flopped between different definitions , wreaking havoc on the names of numbers .
In 1480 , they proposed that a billion have 12 zeros , which is what the British adopted .
Then , in the middle of the 17th century , they knocked three zeros off , so a billion became a number with nine zeros .
The young United States inherited this new definition .
Then in 1948 , the French reverted back to the old system .
1,000,000,000,000 ( one trillion )
To help Obama put the full scale of his rescue plan into perspective , one trillion seconds would take you back 31,709 years to the time of the hunter - gatherers .
If you lined up the 1.5tn pound coins that were reported to have been wiped off the global markets on one single black Friday , they would get you from here to Mars .
1,000,000,000,000,000 ( one quadrillion )
Mathematicians write this number as 1015 : the superscript tells you how many zeros there are after the one .
Given that we are already wiping trillions off the markets , this is the next order of magnitude that 's surely soon going to start appearing on the scene .
The Americans and British call this number a quadrillion , although the European name is a billiard .
The world 's derivative market has a notional value of nearly half a quadrillion dollars - that 's 10 times the value of the world 's output , which is why it is regarded as a ticking timebomb by some analysts .
Line up a quadrillion pound coins , and they will take you outside our solar system .
10100 ... ( one googol )
This numerical name was coined in 1938 by a nine - year - old boy , Milton Sirotta , who was asked by his mathematical uncle to think of a name for a number with one followed by 100 zeros .
If that 's not mindboggling enough , a " googolplex " is a number with a googol number of zeros .
As surely everyone knows , a misspelt version of this number is now the name of a rather well - known internet search engine .
It was also the answer to the million pound question given by Who Wants To Be A Millionaire ?
cheat Major Charles Ingram .

66697152511
This is the largest prime number that has been discovered ( with the aid of a large computer ) to date .
It has nearly 13 m digits and was only found in August of last year .
Printing the full number would require a G2 page about 30 miles long , and it would take more than two months to read aloud all the digits .
It earned the discoverer a prize of $ 100,000 for the first prime number to break the 10 m - digit barrier .
The next prize on offer is $ 150,000 , for a prime number with more than 100 m digits .
Thanks to the ancient Greek mathematician Euclid , we know that there are prime numbers out there with as many digits as we want .
A zillion
Ask a child to name a really big number and they will often go for a zillion .
This name does not correspond to any particular number , but has gone into the lexicon to mean a number of indefinitely large magnitude , coined by the American writer Damon Runyon , the author of Guys and Dolls .
Infinity
The smart kids will go for infinity as the largest number imaginable .
Until the end of the 19th century , the concept represented the unknowable - but amazingly , in 1874 , a mathematician called Georg Cantor revealed that there are many sorts of infinity , some larger than others .
He also showed how one can make sense of adding and multiplying infinities .
He paid for his investigation , however , spending much of his life in a German mental asylum in Halle .
So , in the great scheme of the mathematical universe , the numbers being bandied about over the last few weeks are pretty small beer .
However bad it gets , mathematicians will always be ready with a name and notation to tackle the next onslaught of bad economic figures .

We said that a Zimbabwean dollar note issued in January was printed with a number containing 11 zeros .
In fact , it had 14 - it was a 100,000,000,000,000 note , or in words , one hundred trillion Zimbabwean dollars .

No , this is not Jedi mind game workout equipment -- even if it looks like it .
Mattel is bringing its Mind Flex game to market this fall -- and you control the action through hand , eye , and mind coordination .
The game features an obstacle course that you will use your brainwave activity to control .
The game relies on NeuroSky 's technology and sensors that reside in the headset apparatus .
( See video coverage of NeuroSky technology )
One sensor is in the headset itself , against your forehead ; two more clip onto your earlobes .
The sensors measure theta - wave activity in your brain ; the waves are directly related to your level of focus and concentration .
The sensors register the theta - wave activity , translate that activity into a signal , and transmit it as a radio frequency to the Mind Flex .
The more theta - wave activity there is , the faster the little fan in the unit will spin .
The speed the fan spins at , and therefore moves the ball , is based on how hard you concentrate .
The faster the fan spins , the higher the ball goes along the Z axis .
Turn a dial and move the ball along the X and Y axis .
Mind Flex is due out in Fall 2009 , and will sell for $ 80
Barack Obama will pay homage to slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King today as he vows to revive the spirit of sacrifice to overcome war and economic crisis during his upcoming presidency .
As Americans celebrate Martin Luther King , David Plouffe , manager of " Obama for America , " said the president - elect planned to spend the day highlighting community service .

" Help kick off an ongoing commitment to serve our communities by taking part in this extraordinary day of service , " Plouffe said in an appeal to Obama followers .
" Sign up to attend or host an event in your community and help rebuild America one neighborhood at a time . "
A new CNN / Opinion Research Corp. poll showed that nearly seven in 10 African Americans believe that with the election of Obama , Martin Luther King 's dream of racial equality has been fulfilled .
Meanwhile , 84 per cent of those surveyed said they approved of how Obama is handling the presidential transition .
Yesterday , the president - elect stood in the shadow of the Lincoln Memorial , dedicated to the slain president who brought the United States intact through the Civil War and abolished slavery , and gave a somber assessment of the perils ahead despite the exuberant mood among the crowd .
" In the course of our history , only a handful of generations have been asked to confront challenges as serious as the ones we face right now .
Our nation is at war .
Our economy is in crisis , " he said .
" I wo n't pretend that meeting any one of these challenges will be easy .
It will take more than a month or a year , and it will likely take many , " Obama said .
" But never forget that the true character of our nation is revealed not during times of comfort and ease , but by the right we do when the moment is hard .
" I ask you to help reveal that character once more , and together , we can carry forward as one nation , and one people , the legacy of our forefathers that we celebrate today . "

U2 , Bruce Springsteen and Stevie Wonder -- whose songs were totemic anthems of Obama 's barnstorming rise to power -- headlined a concert for a sea of people standing in arctic cold in front of Abraham Lincoln 's memorial .
It was part of an unprecedented run-up to Obama 's inauguration that has generated an outpouring of public enthusiasm and high hopes even as the country faces two wars and a dire economic crisis .
The hundreds of thousands attending were the advance guard of an inaugural crowd expected to number millions , as an elaborate security operation began with police and army reservists taking up position across the US capital .
In contrast to the jubilant afternoon party , Obama struck a more somber note as he joined vice president - elect Joseph Biden in laying a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Arlington Cemetery .
Dressed in black winter coats to guard against the freezing temperatures , Obama and Biden held their hands over their hearts as " Taps , " the US military 's haunting lament to the fallen , was played by a lone bugler .
Obama and his wife Michelle then climbed into the incoming president 's new armored Cadillac with a blue license plate reading " 44 " -- his numerical position as the newest commander - in - chief .
Along a railroad from Philadelphia to Washington , a route once traced by his hero Lincoln , Obama on Saturday urged Americans to adopt a new " Declaration of Independence " from bigotry , small thinking and ideology .
Aides said those themes will figure large in Obama 's inaugural address after he is sworn in around noon tomorrow .
Rahm Emanuel , the next White House chief of staff , told NBC the speech would declare an end to " the culture of anything goes " and demand a new era of responsibility from government , corporate boardrooms and the American people .
Incoming White House press secretary Robert Gibbs vied to temper sky - high expectations both worldwide and at home , as the United States grapples with its longest recession since World War II .
" We did not get into the situation overnight .
The problems and the challenges that our country face did n't happen all last week .
It 's going to take us some time , " Gibbs said on " Fox News Sunday " .
But Gibbs and other senior aides said Obama would act rapidly to enact his economic revival plans via a mammoth stimulus package worth 825 billion dollars .
And on his first full day in office Wednesday , the aides said , Obama will also convene his top military brass to map a way out of Iraq and recommit US troops against a resurgent Taliban in Afghanistan .
After the tumultuous Bush years , Obama comes to office with the highest poll ratings since Ronald Reagan in 1981 .
The New York Times and CBS News said 79 percent of respondents to its poll were optimistic about the next four years .
Since love has always been , and will perhaps continue to be relative to each individual , scientists have a really tough job to narrow the concept down to a universal “ recipe . ”
The same goes for attractiveness , which is equally hard to pin down in theory .
In this sense , a new study comes to show that , where men are concerned , an 8.2 - second gaze means they rate a woman highly attractive , which raises the odds of love at first sight .
The latest study was conducted on 115 male students , gathered in one single location and confronted with beautiful young actresses and models .
Their eye movements , as they interacted with the women , were studied with the help of hidden cameras and then analyzed by comparison .
As the figures revealed , a man who rated a lady attractive held eye contact for about an average of 8.2 seconds , which increased his chances of falling in love at first sight , researchers said .
Oppositely , if the gaze lasted for about 4.5 seconds or less , the man in question was not interested in any way in the woman he had made eye contact with , which meant he did not consider her good - looking enough .
Ladies , on the other hand , did not make this distinction , since they paid the same amount of attention and held eye contact for just as long with both men they were interested in and those they did not fancy , for one reason or another , the same study showed .
Researchers believe that this difference between men and women can best be explained by the fact that the former use eye contact to seek fertile and fit mates .
Meanwhile , the latter shy from making eye contact or drawing unwanted attention onto themselves for fear of unwanted pregnancies and single parenthood , it has been said .
However , one might as well add , if eye contact does not lead to love , then online dating certainly will , as another recent study has indicated .
Of the 22 million people registered with dating sites in 2007 , one in five actually met their true love and walked down the aisle with them , which would clearly indicate that online dating comes in handy when looking for love .
“ To date , there has been no systematic study of love in the context - of relationships formed via online dating sites .
But with the popularity of online dating , it is imperative we understand the factors that influence satisfaction in relationships formed in this way . ”
Dr. Jeff Gavin , a researcher who studied the phenomenon of “ love on the Internet , ” told the Daily Mail a while back .
WaMu sues FDIC for more than $ 13 billion over forced sale Stephen C. Webster
Published : Saturday March 21 , 2009
Print This Email This Washington Mutual , the bankrupt , seized and " under investigation " financial institution which saw some operations forcibly sold off to JPMorgan Chase in 2008 , is suing the agency that guarantees Americans ' deposits , and that agency is running low on funds .
Washington Mutual ( WaMu ) , formerly one of the nation 's most prestigious banks and alleged holder of over $ 307 billion in assets , is suing the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation for more than $ 13 billion over the roll - up of its banking division into JPMorgan Chase & Co .
Washington Mutual was seized by federal regulators in Sept. 2008 ; the company filed for bankruptcy immediately thereafter .
The ensuing investigation " one of the largest and most complex federal investigations ever undertaken in Western Washington , " a US Attorney told the Seattle Times
" In a complaint filed with the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia , the thrift 's former parent accused the FDIC of having on January 23 made a ' cryptic disallowance ' of its claims , prompting the lawsuit , " reported Reuters .
" It also accused the FDIC of agreeing to an unreasonably low price in arranging the a $ 1.9 billion sale of the banking business to JPMorgan on September 25 , when regulators seized Washington Mutual and appointed the FDIC as receiver . "
" On a Friday night in September 2008 , the government forced WaMu into a shotgun marriage with new owners at pennies on the dollar .
The FDIC seized the bank and then sold it to JPMorgan Chase for $ 1.9 billion , " reported MSNBC .
" [ A ] federal task force continues to comb through a mountain of documents looking into possible criminal charges against WaMu executives .
It 's looking for fraud in how the company built such an unstable business based on subprime mortgages . "
When banks insured by the FDIC are seized or declare bankruptcy , the agency returns depositors ' funds up to $ 100,000 .
" The thing is , the FDIC that is supposed to pay customers is running low  there have just been a lot of bank failures ... " noted NPR 's Jim Zarroli when JPMorgan Chase agreed to purchase WaMu 's banking division .
On the same day the United States saw its 20th bank failure of 2009 .
An FDIC spokesman would not comment on the suit to Reuters .

Reporters jump ship
In three months since Election Day , at least a half - dozen prominent journalists have taken jobs working for the federal government .
Journalists , including some of those who ’ve jumped ship , say it ’s better to have a solid job in government than a shaky job — or none at all — in an industry that ’s fading fast .

But conservative critics answer with a question : Would journalists be making the same career choices if John McCain had beaten Barack Obama in November ?
“ Obama bails out more media water - carriers , ” conservative blogger Michelle Malkin wrote upon hearing that the Chicago Tribune ’s Jill Zuckman is taking a job with the Obama administration .
Blogs at both the Weekly Standard and the National Review are pointing to a “ revolving door ” that spins between the media and the Obama administration .
And while Brent Bozell , president of the conservative Media Research Center , acknowledges that financial troubles may be forcing reporters out of newsrooms , he thinks it ’s worth noting where they ’re going .
“ When some leave journalism because of a reduction in staff , what ’s the natural landing spot ? ”
The Obama administration , ” Bozell charged .
Zuckman says it ’s not so .
In an interview , she said that she began looking around for a new job last month , motivated by the grim state of the industry — her employer , the Tribune Co. , recently slashed its D.C. bureau — and also by her own feeling that she ’d accomplished what she ’d set out to do covering politics .
She said she had no plans to go to the administration — until she heard about an opening under Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood , a former Republican representative she ’s long respected for reaching across the aisle .
So , would Zuckman have taken — or even been offered — such a job if McCain were president ?
“ I have a great deal of respect for [ McCain ] and have thoroughly enjoyed covering him over the years , ” Zuckman said .
“ But there ’s no way I can answer your hypothetical because I would n’t know who he would have chosen for secretary of transportation .
My decision to go to work for the Obama administration is tied up in my relationship with Ray LaHood and his focus on getting the economy back on track . ”
As for other reporters making similar moves , Zuckman said that she did n’t think there would be so many “ if the industry were stable . ”
But it is n’t , and there are .
On Tuesday , Cox ’s Scott Shepard joined Sen .
John Kerry ’s office as a speechwriter , becoming the second journalist this year to take a job under the Massachusetts Democrat .
Investigative reporter Doug Frantz is now chief investigator under the Kerry - helmed Senate Foreign Relations Committee .
A week before Zuckman announced that she ’s headed for Obama ’s Transportation Department , her Tribune colleague Peter Gosselin signed on as speechwriter for Obama ’s treasury secretary , Tim Geithner .
In December , Jay Carney relinquished his perch as Time ’s Washington bureau chief to become Vice President Joe Biden ’s communications director .
Warren Bass left the Washington Post ’s Outlook section to write speeches and advise Dr. Susan Rice at the United Nations .
Daniel W. Reilly left Politico to become communications director for Rep. Ed Markey ( D - Mass . )
Linda Douglass left the National Journal for the Obama campaign back in May and is expected to become assistant secretary for public affairs in the department of Health and Human Services .
On Monday , Pew ’s Project for Excellence in Journalism published a report on “ The New Washington Press Corps , ” grim statistics confirming the high rate at which regional newspapers are shuttering their D.C. bureaus while niche and foreign outlets grow .
Of the journalists flocking to government jobs , Pew Project Director Tom Rosenstiel says : “ There ’s no mystery here , and I do n’t think the key to this is ideological as much as economic .
The newspaper industry , in Washington in particular , is suffering mightily . ”
Rosenstiel noted that Shepard would have been out of a job by April , when Cox ’s D.C. bureau will close after over three decades — and that Zuckman ’s bureau has been downsized following consolidation among the Tribune Co. ’s papers .
In the case of Frantz , who was laid off from Portfolio magazine in November , Rosenstiel said his Senate job is n’t much of a departure from the investigative reporting he ’d done for decades — both require “ a prosecutorial mindset . ”
Both require money , too , and government may be better suited than media companies to provide it for now .
“ I did n't leave journalism easily and I 'll always think of myself as a reporter , with a notepad tucked in his back pocket and a lot of unanswered questions , ” Frantz told Politico last month .
But even if Frantz views himself as a reporter , he ’s no longer working for the Newhouse , Sulzberger or Chandler families .
Instead , a Democratic politician signs the paychecks .
Frantz is n’t alone in downplaying the partisan aspect of his new job .
Maybe it ’s based on a lifetime of nonpartisan conditioning , but many of the reporters who ’ve made the leap to government seem hesitant to admit that they ’re no longer impartial observers .
“ This is a Democratic administration ; we ’re obviously on that side of the aisle , but I do n’t see this as a partisan job at all , ” Carney told the Times a couple weeks back .
Carney told the Times that he had “ an affinity ” with Biden and Obama , but that it did n’t influence his coverage at the newsweekly .
Time staffers have told Politico that they could never tell Carney ’s politics during the 2008 race .
“ I did n’t even know Jay was a Democrat , ” Time ’s Joe Klein said .
But does that mean Carney would have been just as eager to take a job as press secretary for Vice President Sarah Palin ?
Currently traveling with Biden , Carney declined to be interviewed .
For Bozell , the ease of the transition is telling .
“ If you are in journalism , and you can so easily fit in the world of politics , it tells you something , ” Bozell said , “ that you were not that detached from it when you were in journalism . ”
Perhaps proving Bozell ’s point , journalists say that there used to be more stigma attached when a reporter crossed over to cover someone he ’s covered .
Now , they say , it ’s hard to consider a colleague a sell - out when the alternative to a government job could be the unemployment line .
Al Hunt , the executive Washington editor for Bloomberg News , said that making the switch used to be a “ very weighty ” decision — and that it ’s not anymore .
“ It ’s a sad commentary on the state of the business , ” Hunt said , adding that people have “ got to put food on the table . ”
He acknowledged that journalists were n’t exactly flocking to government work when George W. Bush took office in 2001 , but he said that the industry factors were different then .
No one was seriously predicting in February 2001 that large cities in the United States might be without daily newspapers by the time the year was out .
They ’re making those kinds of predictions now .
And Hunt says those economic fears — rather than an ideological bias — are driving the decisions journalists are making .
“ If you ca n’t find a job in journalism and you live in Washington , the only option is a government job , and the government is dominated by Democrats , ” he said .
“ That ’s less ideological than it is situational . ”
Henry Paulson and the Obama Administration invite all failed banking institutions to come to Washington and enjoy our trillion dollar tax payer funded all you can eat free money buffet .
You must take all you can grab and be sure to buy all the smaller banks you can during this special offer .
This is for a limited time only unless of course you convince us that you really really need another trillion and then of course we will dump another huge bucket of barrowed money on the buffet table for you to enjoy .
You must at least say you are going to start lending this money out to the consumers but of course there will be no real oversight and you can use the money for raises and bonuses or for buying other banks so long as you promise not to do it too often .
Once you have gorged yourselves at the public money trust trough be sure to send us those really bad unsecure investment instruments you have been printing up like it was worth something .
We will put all of those in a bad bank and hang it around the necks of the tax payer so their great great grand children can pay the interest on it for the next hundred years or so .
A good time will be had by all .
Except for those tax payers of course .
I guess if the US government defaults it will be ok .
After all the Chinese own most of the US debt .
In China when the executives in charge of important business sectors fail the government executes them .
Lets all hope when they take over the United States in a credit default they do not start implimenting the same policy in the US .

The last known wishes of the Lincoln family - to leave the president alone - came in 1876 after a group of Chicago counterfeiters tried to steal his remains from his memorial in Springfield , Ill. , and seek a ransom for $ 200,000 along with the release of an imprisoned cohort .
They were unsuccessful ; Lincoln 's coffin was later encased in steel and concrete to prevent further theft attempts .
Flashy feathers get all the attention in the evolution of dinosaur flight , but a more complex internal adaptation provided the aerodynamics necessary for lizards to go airborne .
Fossil analysis suggests that pterosaurs had sacs of air in their bodies , starting in their lungs and spreading beyond , even hollowing out their bones .
They were , in short , not nearly as heavy as their size suggested .
" We offer a reconstruction of the breathing system in pterosaurs , one that proposes the existence of a mechanism with the same essential structure to that of modern birds — except 70 million years earlier , " study co-author Leon Claessens , a biologist at College of the Holy Cross , said in a press release .
The findings , published Thursday in Public Library of Science ONE , answer a lingering mystery : pterosaur skeletons have features suggestive of wing flapping , but the energy necessary to keep such heavy bodies in flight would have been huge .
Claessens ' team could n't look at fossilization - unfriendly soft tissue , but instead compared the skeletons of large modern birds and pterosaurs .
Using x-ray movies and CT scans , they charted the skeletal mechanics of wing flapping in birds , then found similar bone structures in the dinosaurs .
They also observed nearly identical relationships between body size and bone density .
Without internal balloons and hollow bones , dinosaurs could n't have flown , much less reached sizes comparable to small airplanes .
Fortunately for humans , however , birds have followed an evolutionary path less prone to gigantism .
After all , who'd want to deal with Cessna - sized pigeons ?

Sweden 's new anti piracy laws are based on an EU directive Internet traffic in Sweden fell by 33 % as the country 's new anti-piracy law came into effect , reports suggest .
Sweden 's new policy - the Local IPRED law - allows copyright holders to force internet service providers ( ISP ) to reveal details of users sharing files .
According to figures released by the government statistics agency - Statistics Sweden - 8 % of the entire population use peer - to - peer sharing .
Popular BitTorrent sharing site , The Pirate Bay , is also based in Sweden .
The new law , which is based on the European Union 's Intellectual Property Rights Enforcement Directive ( IPRED ) , allows copyright holders to obtain a court order forcing ISPs to provide the IP addresses identifying which computers have been sharing copyrighted material .
Figures from Netnod , a Swedish firm that measures internet traffic in and out of the country , suggest traffic fell from an average of 120 Gbps to 80 Gbps on the day the new law came into effect .
Traffic lite Speaking to the BBC , Christian Engstrom , vice - chairman of the Swedish Pirate Party - said the drop in traffic was a direct result of the new law , but that it would only be a temporary fall .
We have to change people 's perception on file sharing
Kjell Bohlund
Swedish Publishers ' Association " Today , there is a very drastic reduction in internet traffic .
But experience from other countries suggests that while file - sharing drops on the day a law is passed , it starts climbing again .
" One of the reasons is that it takes people a few weeks to figure out how to change their security settings so that they can share files anonymously , " he added .
Mr Engstrom acknowledged that the new legislation would scare a number off file - sharing , and that the odds of getting caught had increased , but said that the risks to illegal file - sharers were still quite low .
" We estimate there are two million file - sharing [ computers ] in Sweden , so even if they prosecuted 1,000 people to make an example of them , for an individual user it is still a very small risk . "
Prolific sharer
However , for some , that risk is already a reality .
A number of book publishers in Sweden have applied to the courts , on the day the law came out , forcing an ISP to disclose the details of one file - sharer who , the publishers claim , has more than 3,000 audio books on his server .
Speaking to the BBC , Kjell Bohlund - chair of the Swedish Publishers ' Association - said that until the new law was passed , they were virtually powerless to act .
" Before 1 April , the only thing we could do about illegal file sharing was to refer it to the police , who were very reluctant to take it on .
The Pirate Bay founders have denied the charges " Now we can go get the courts to force ISPs to disclose the user information of an IP address .
" In two weeks time , we will know exactly who owns that IP .
We can then do nothing , ask him to stop , or sue him for damages .
We wo n't do this for small offenders , this is just for the big fish , " he added .
Other companies are watching the case with interest , to determine what the court deems to be sufficient proof .
One action which began before the new legislation was the prosecution of four men accused of promoting copyright infringement via the hugely popular BitTorrent sharing site , The Pirate Bay .
The Pirate Bay hosts thousands of links to so - called torrent files , which allow for movies , TV programmes and applications to be shared online .
A verdict is expected later this month .
Public perception Mr Engstrom said the new law was " a disaster " , not just for file - sharers , but for Sweden as a whole .
" Dealing with illegal file - sharing is a job for the police .
It is their job to enforce the law .
" Now we have given private corporations the legal right to go after our civilians .
That 's not how Western democracies work , " he said .
Mr Bohlund acknowledged that cracking down on illegal file - sharing was not a long - term solution .
" In a study , 80 % of people thought we should n't go after file - sharers .
" But ask them how they feel about taking money out of the pockets of musicians , authors or artists and that number falls by a significant amount , " he said .

Hovering over Dubai is a cloud called nemesis .
The first time I saw the place two years ago through a plane window , its towers were hovering in the heat over the desert , gulping up water and energy and fussed round by reputedly a quarter of the world 's construction cranes .
Even then the vision was unmistakable , of Ozymandias and his " vast and trunkless legs of stone " .
When prices go up , buildings go up .
When prices come down , buildings tend to stay up .
Until recently visitors to Dubai returned gasping .
This was truly a city designed from start to finish by autocrats and architects .
It was the last word in iconic overkill , a festival of egotism with humanity denied .
It was an architectural chorus line of towers , each shouting louder and kicking higher .
People were ants .
Dubai must have as many publicists as it has towers .
Business and travel journalists in need of a freebie can just call .
So , too , did a stage army of British writers who went to last month 's Dubai International Festival of Literature , pretending to discover that it was not a free country ( and practises censorship ) only after being installed in their luxury rooms .
A " tower of Babel " of a place " with neither charm nor character " , declared an ungrateful Germaine Greer .
Even as the property market turned sour last autumn , the vast Atlantis hotel , built for $ 1.5 bn with a whale shark in its swimming pool , was spending $ 20 m on its launch party .
Yet still the supplements and television contra-deals spluttered their superlatives - recently from a near - hysterical Piers Morgan .
Every time the builder of the tallest tower in the world , the monster of Burj Dubai , sees the local ruler , Sheikh Mohammed Al - Maktoum , he is told to add more storeys for fear someone else may build an even taller one .
The stockmarket is down 70 % on 2005 's level , and construction has ceased on half the unfinished towers that stretch out into the desert .
Eighty per cent of the population of Dubai are passing migrants who are there , like gold - diggers of old , only for the cash .
The cash is going and so are they , leaving expensive cars in the street and at the airport , many fleeing possible imprisonment for debt .
Consider , meanwhile , the city of Detroit .
Here was another that rose on the shore of an inland sea , fuelled by the cult of hypermobility .
With the implosion of the motor industry it has gone to seed .
Houses are pictured boarded - up or selling for a dollar .
Dogs roam empty streets .
Wind howls through vacant shops .
The unbelievable has come to pass .
The love child of America 's greatest postwar passion is preparing to die .
Detroit is part of a great country that has shown itself capable of rescuing even its rustbelt municipalities .
But this depends on finding people who will live in a place from which most have fled .
Luckily , much of Detroit is of low - rise plot housing that could be transformed at least into Bohemian neighbourhoods , like ruined New Orleans .
No such option is available to Dubai .
It is the ultimate Corbusian city , rigid in format and old - fashioned in conception , based on the grids and set squares of super - planners , and on grand symbolic buildings rather than intimate streets .
It can not respond to demand and supply for land and property , let alone to the wishes of free citizens .
Human scale is confined to the Las - Vegas style replicas of Florence and Venice adopted by hotels that realise guests will not come if slapped constantly in the face by modern architecture .
One business that cannot afford inhumanity is a hotel .
Such cities are like the planned science settlements of Soviet Russia or the instant downtowns of American " metroplexes " , in which people do as planners ordain .
There are no visual surprises , no corners of privacy away from big brother or at least big car .
Buildings are exclusive and architecturally defensive , like London 's Barbican .
I can only imagine that Dubai will one day be seen as a punctuation mark on the architectural follies of the past half century .
This off - the - shelf city state has been built on laundering the profits of oil , drugs , arms and western aid .
Its sheikh was not a complete fool , like comparable African and Latin American autocrats .
He realised that city states cannot live on one product alone , unless it is money .
Since he had no oil , he would drill for money .
Mohammed Al - Maktoum 's failing has been his belief that megalomania is best when done big .
He built a giant port and a giant airport , a giant stock exchange , giant finance sector and giant shopping mall .
Dubai is a monument to big - must - be- beautiful .
During the gold rush the prospectors came .
But as the rush wanes , Dubai is believed to be nursing the world 's biggest per-capita debt .
It may have to be bailed out by its neighbouring Gulf states , whose more prudent attractions Dubai tried to outshine ; indeed , the process has already begun .
Nothing can bail out a tower if there is nobody to live in it .
It can not be pulled down and Chipping Camden replicated on the spot .
The same goes for thousands of villas and apartment blocks along the Gulf shore and on the artificial islands in the world 's most boring sea .
They will stand empty in the heat .
Most were bought as investments .
The value of those investments has fallen an estimated 60 % in just six months .
If their emptiness reaches a tipping point where there are no neighbours , no shops , no services and no social life , they will decay , like downtown Detroit .
Smart money says Dubai could survive as the playground of India , even if the oil money of the Middle East moves back to more salubrious Europe .
This depends on India failing to supply its own playground and , critically , on Dubai surviving what could be a Muslim backlash against its hesitantly hedonistic western lifestyle .
Rivals such as Dohar , Abu Dhabi and Bahrain - especially as they are now bailing out Dubai - may welcome its swift return to the desert ecology .
Just as visitors to the Middle East see half - built , mostly abandoned concrete housing blocks and barracks littering the landscape of Syria and Jordan , so the towers of Dubai will become casualties not of human greed but of architectural folly .
Their lifts and services , expensive to maintain , will collapse .
Their colossal facades will shed glass .
Sand will drift round their trunkless legs .
Animals will inhabit their basements .
Thousands of residential properties , if occupied at all , will be squatted by a migratory poor , like the hotel towers of the Spanish littoral or Corbusier 's blockhouses of Chandigarh in India .
Refugees will colonise the camps where Indian workers have lived as they built Dubai .
Gangs will seize the gated estates and random anarchy will rule the soulless boulevards .
If it is lucky Dubai will at least be a refuge from the political cataclysms that could engulf countries such as Pakistan , Iran , Iraq and Saudi Arabia .
But mostly the dunes will reclaim the place .
In centuries to come , tourists will share with Ozymandias the message : " Look on my works ye mighty and despair . "
With Shelley they will see how , " round the decay / Of that colossal wreck , boundless and bare / The lone and level sands stretch far away . "

Porn star strips at Milan stock exchange to protest financial crisis , traders immediately go long
American protestors have a lot to learn from our European brothers .
Or , to be more precise , from our European sisters .
Police officials say an Italian porn star stripped last Tuesday at the Milan stock exchange to protest the financial crisis .
Laura Perego climbed on to a table inside the exchange covered only by her mutandines ( Babel Fish , do n’t fail us now ) and a painting of Italian flag
Why are n’t the American networks reporting this story 24/7 ?
They should cover this brave , patriotic woman at least as much as Cindy Sheehan .
Or uncover her , as the case may be .

This past Saturday over 120 illegal billboards were white - washed and covered with art in New York City by a team of volunteers and artists .
The guerrilla operation was organized by The Public Ad Campaign over the past four months .
Barbara Celis writes :
As the main organizer explained to the artists who choose to get involved , the agency that owns the ‘ attacked ’ billboards operates on an illegal basis .
“ NPA outdoor operates over 500 street level billboards in NYC ranging in size from about 4 ’ x4 ′ to 50 ’x12 ′ .
All of these advertising structures are illegal .
I found this out by talking to the NYC Department of Buildings which has no permits for the NPA outdoor structures but has its hands full dealing with the rampant illegal billboard situation .
I have also spoken directly with NPA outdoor employees who have told me that the NYPD will jail them from time to time at which point NPA lawyers bail them out and they are compensated 500 dollars for the nuisance of spending the night in jail ” .
NPA Outdoor had teams putting their illegal advertising back up early Sunday morning .
I personally spotted ads going up over artwork on 8th Avenue and 26th Street at 2 AM .
Celis interviewed an artist at the afterparty who said , “ Art is about the experience , about living the moment , and what we did was so fucking great for New York that even if they take down our pieces , we have learned that we can do it , and we will do it again .
New yorkers had fun today in a very unusual way .
It ’s priceless ! ”

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A privately owned U.S. communications satellite collided with a defunct Russian satellite in the first such collision in space , a U.S. military spokesman said on Wednesday .
The collision , which took place on Tuesday in low - earth orbit , involved a spacecraft of privately owned Iridium Satellite LLC and a “ non-operational ” Russian communications satellite , said Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Les Kodlick of the U.S. Strategic Command .
“ We believe it ’s the first time that two satellites have collided in orbit , ” he said .
The command ’s Joint Space Operations Center was tracking 500 to 600 new bits of debris , some as small as 10 centimeters ( 3.9 inches ) across , in addition to the 18,000 or so other man-made objects it has catalogued in space , Kodlick said .
The collision occurred at roughly 780 kilometers ( 485 miles ) , an altitude used by satellites that monitor weather and carry telephone communications among other things , he said .
“ It ’s a very important orbit for a lot of satellites , ” he said .
The International Space Station flies at a lower altitude and is the command ’s No. 1 priority in attempting to prevent collisions , Kodlick said .

Frau von der Leyen und der Kreuzzug gegen Kinderpornografie : Eine Polemik
Es ist selten , dass eine Äußerung eines Politikers bei mir tatsächlich dazu führt , dass mich nicht nur ein gewisses Unbehagen , sondern vielmehr eine tatsächliche Übelkeit überkommt .
Zu sehr bin ich an Dummheit , Arroganz und Unwissen gewöhnt - " ölgetränkt " würde eine Bekannte von mir sagen .
Es passiert noch seltener , dass nicht nur Hilflosigkeit oder
Wut auftreten , sondern der Wunsch , denjenigen , der sich gerade äußert , zu schütteln und ihn anzuschreien .
Natürlich wird in mir kein Wunsch nach härteren Mitteln wach ( Anzeigen wegen der Planung einer Straftat kann man sich also sparen , ebenso wie die präventive Warnung davor , dass hier ein " potenzieller Amokläufer " schreibt ) , aber ich gebe zu , dass es derzeit jemanden gibt , der mir mit fast jeder Äußerung den Tag verdirbt .
Die ( so kommt es mir vor ) stets hold lächelnde Frau von der Leyen ist für mich zum Prototyp des Politikers geworden , der ohne jegliches Fachwissen auskommt , ohne Expertise , Intelligenz oder Bereitschaft zum Dialog .
Dies verwundert umso mehr , wenn man sich ihren Werdegang ansieht .
Es handelt sich hier nicht etwa um eine Frau , die , salopp gesagt , außer Kinderkriegen zu nichts fähig ist - Frau von der Leyen hat studiert , besitzt einen akademischen Grad .
Man darf also doch eine gewisse Intelligenz voraussetzen .
Doch beim Thema Kinderpornografie ist die Bundesfamilienministerin schlichtweg eine Zumutung .
Nicht nur , dass sie immer und immer wieder überhaupt nicht auf die Problematik , was als Kinderpornografie gilt , eingeht , sondern betont , dass es sich um Säuglinge , bei denen nie wieder etwas repariert werden könne , dreht usw ...
Kein Wort dazu , dass auch Schriften als Kinderpornografie gelten oder virtuelle Kinderpornografie , bei der kein Kind jemals zu Schaden kam - hier springt der von der Leyensche Antwortgenerator sofort über auf den " Einstiegsdrogenmodus " , der mal erwähnt , dass unbedarfte Nutzer auf die Kinderpornoseiten kommen und gar nicht merken , dass sie die Einstiegsdroge konsumieren ( als würde jemand , der bisher keinerlei Interesse an Kinderpornografie hat , auf wundersame Weise sofort durch den Anblick solcher Bilder zum lechzenden Konsumenten werden , der auf " immer härtere Kost " aus ist ) .
Mal aber geht es elegant weiter zur " Störung eines Massenmarktes " .
Fast gebetsmühlenartig wird wiederholt , dass 80 % der Nutzer von Providern " ganz normale Kunden " sind ( was ist der Rest ? ) und diese durch die " Stoppschilder " daran gehindert werden , dass sie durch Zufall auf solche Seiten geraten - während die anderen 20 % versierter sind und dadurch verdächtig .
So ist sich Frau von der Leyen nicht zu schade dafür , im Interview mit Radio Eins so viel , dezent ausgedrückt , Unsinn zu verzapfen , der gleichzeitig so infam ist , dass es kaum mehr zu ertragen ist .
Wir wissen , dass bei den vielen Kunden , die es gibt , rund 80 Prozent die ganz normalen User des Internets sind .
Und jeder , der jetzt zuhört , kann eigentlich sich selber fragen , wen kenne ich , der Sperren im Internet aktiv umgehen kann .
Die müssen schon deutlich versierter sein .
Das sind die 20 Prozent .
Die sind zum Teil schwer Pädokriminelle .
Die bewegen sich in ganz anderen Foren .
Die sind versierte Internetnutzer , natürlich auch geschult im Laufe der Jahre in diesem widerwärtigen Geschäft .
Von der Leyen
Planlos eiert die Ministerin um die Frage herum , was denn nun gespeichert wird beim Aufruf des Stoppschilds .
" Nein , der unkomplizierte Versuch , also der zufällige Versuch , da machen Sie sich nicht strafbar " , wird beschwichtigend gesagt und auf Spammails und falsche URLs eingegangen .
Und fast schon atmete ich auf , wurde jedoch sofort eines Besseren belehrt .
Diejenigen , die sich strafbar machen , also das aktive Suchen nach Seiten , das merken Sie , wenn jemand immer wieder versucht auch in die typischen Seiten reinzukommen versucht in dieses
Thema , und natürlich der Besitz , der Vertrieb , der Erwerb dieser Seiten , da machen sie sich strafbar .
Von der Leyen
So schwadroniert die Familienministerin auf wundersame Weise über die Einstiegsdroge Kinderpornografie .
Frau von der Leyen aber verspürt , auch nachdem sie diese widerwärtigen Bilder , wie sie nicht müde wird zu betonen , angesehen hat , keinerlei Ambitionen , weiter solche Bilder zu konsumieren , während andere ihrer Logik zufolge auf diese Art an die Einstiegsdroge herankommen .
Was ist mit den BKA - Mitarbeitern sowie den Journalisten , denen sie die kinderpornografischen Bilder zeigte , um sie auf ihren " Kampf gegen Kinderpornografie " einzuschwören ?
Sind diese alle immun oder hat die technisch inkompetente , rabulistisch jedoch versierte Familienministerin hier neue Kinderpornografiekonsumenten geschaffen , denen demnächst Hausdurchsuchungen ins Haus stehen ?
Wie praktisch wäre es doch , die völlig unbewiesene Behauptung , dass es sich um eine Einstiegsdroge handelt , gleich dazu zu verwenden , Journalisten , denen man die Bilder förmlich aufzwang , entsprechend zu verfolgen - rein präventiv natürlich .
Es werden natürlich nur die Klicks gezählt , die Zugriffe auf die Seiten ... und insofern kann man gar nicht alle verfolgen ... oder so .
Wer sich das Interview zu Gemüte führt , der fragt sich , ob die Ministerin wirklich weiß , was sie redet .
" Das heißt : speichern ? " fragt die Moderatorin , beantwortet mit folgendem Bonmot :
Na ja , speichern ... ich habe Ihnen jetzt eben mal die Zahlen am Tag genannt .
Das können
Sie gar nicht und das ist auch nicht das Ziel .
Aber wenn
Sie manchmal die diffizilen , also die komplexen Vorgänge des Suchens der Polizei nach bestimmten Täterringen und Pornoringen eben , Kinderschänderringen , beobachten - und soweit sich dieses Handwerk dann auch aus einem Puzzle zusammensetzt , gehört mit dazu , die Frage zu stellen , ob jemand immer wieder versucht , einschlägige Seiten aufzurufen und sich dort zu tummeln ... nur das große Massengeschäft ( und wie gesagt : da sind viele auch dabei , die völlig harmlos sind ) , das ist ... da interessiert uns nur , deutlich zu machen : hier geht es nicht weiter , stopp .
Von der Leyen
Wer sich diesen Cut - Up - Text einmal anschaut , der hält Texte von Mark Edward Smith für leicht verständlich , denke ich .
Hier enden Satzanfänge im Nichts , hier wird keinerlei Aussage zur Frage getroffen , hier führen Aussagen ins Irre .
" Das Gesetz , das jetzt im Bundestag ist , lässt grundsätzlich offen , dass , wenn kompliziertere Sperrtechniken verwendet werden , und die obersten Strafbehörden , zum Beispiel die Staatsanwaltschaft , das brauchen , grundsätzlich Spuren verfolgt werden könnten " , erklärte Frau von der Leyen fachkompetent wie immer .
Es ist nicht nur ein sinnloser Kreuzzug , der hier geführt wird , der keinem Kind hilft , es ist auch ein infamer Kreuzzug einer Mutter , die jegliches Maß verloren hat , deren Tunnelblick und Inkompetenz die Realität völlig ausblenden , so sie nicht wirklich bösartig agiert .
Es wird immer schwerer , der Familienminister diese negativen Attribute noch abzunehmen , wenn sie davon schwadroniert , dass man sich ja melden kann , Hilfe suchen kann ... wenn gleichzeitig sämtliche Kritik einerseits als " unterirdisch " bezeichnet wird oder die Kritiker gleich mal mit einem " die sind versiert und zum Teil schwerst pädokriminell " verleumdet .
Natürlich ist sie nicht so dumm , alle Kritiker so zu bezeichnen - selbst eine Kreuzzüglerin will keine Verleumdungsklagen forcieren , doch die Intention ist klar .
Ich soll mich fragen , wen ich kenne , der Sperren im Internet aktiv umgehen kann - das rät mir die holde Ursula .
Gut , das tue ich hiermit .
Und meine Antwort lautet : Eine Menge Menschen .
Menschen , die sich seit Jahren gegen Websperren einsetzen und damit leben müssen , dass deshalb - nicht zuletzt wegen des Giftversprühens von Politikern wie Frau von der Leyen - ihr Leben in Trümmern liegt .
Menschen , die regelmäßig dem Verdacht ausgesetzt sind , an Kinderpornografie interessiert oder Nazis zu sein , nur weil sie sich nicht für die Sperrung von Webseiten aussprechen .
Menschen , die Hausdurchsuchungen erleben , weil sie auf Webseiten verlinken , die auf Sperrlisten hinweisen , in denen ein Großteil von nicht kinderpornografischen Seiten zu finden ist .
Es sind Menschen , die sich Anleitungen über die Umgehung von Websperren im Netz ansehen , sich entsprechende Videos herunterladen und sich fortbilden , damit nicht demnächst ihr Netz von allzu übereifrigen BKA - Leuten bestimmt wird , die durch Lügen und Betrügen dafür gesorgt haben , dass das Vertrauen in die Strafverfolgung gleich Null ist .
Ich aber frage mich ganz andere Dinge zur Zeit :
Ich frage mich
Wie viele Kinder in dem Moment , in dem Frau von der Leyen ihr Interview gab , ( sexueller ) Gewalt durch Bekannte oder Verwandte ausgesetzt sind , die nicht zuletzt durch immer weniger Geld und Personal bei Jugendämtern , Beratungsstellen etc. keine Hilfe bekommen ?
Wie viele der in Heimen gequälten und ( sexuell ) missbrauchten Kinder sich voller Abscheu abwenden , wenn sie sehen , wie die Bundesfamilienministerin mit ihrem sinnfreien " Kampf gegen Kinderporno " Wahlkampf betreibt , während sie die Entschädigung der Heimkinder verschleppt , den Dachverband der ehemaligen Täterorganisationen mit der Aufklärung des Missbrauchs und der Aufarbeitung des Kapitels beauftragt ( und den Opfern gerade einmal zwei Sitze am runden Tisch zugesteht ?
Wie viele der missbrauchten Kinder würgen , wenn sie die Äußerungen der Ministerin lesen , während gleichzeitig eben diese Ministerin die Einrichtung einer Hotline für diese ehemaligen Heimkinder und deren Unterstützung bei der Traumaverarbeitung verzichten will ?
Wie viele Kinder nicht zuletzt in den ärmeren Ländern in der Kinderprostitution ihre letzte Chance zum Überleben sehen , während Politiker meinen , mit Websperren und dem " Safer Internet " - Programm sich brüsten zu müssen , während die Frage der gerechten Verteilung des Reichtums der Welt weiterhin nicht angetastet wird und somit die Ursachen für Kinderprostitution beispielsweise uninteressant sind ?
Wie muss es Menschen gehen , die sexuelle Gewalt erlebt haben , die sich dennoch gegen Websperren aussprechen , die nun aber durch Frau von der Leyen , wenn auch geschickt formuliert , in einen Topf mit " pädokriminellen " ( wir sprechen also nicht mehr von pädophilen Menschen , sondern von pädokriminellen - ein ebenso unsinniger wie beliebter Begriff bei jenen , die in ihrem " Kampf gegen Kinderporno " vor nichts zurückschrecken )
Menschen geworfen zu werden ?
Wie muss es einem Menschen gehen , der ein Bild von sich sieht , auf dem er sexueller Gewalt ausgesetzt ist ... der sieht , wie Unmengen von Geldern darin investiert werden , dieses Bild zu blocken , diejenigen , die die Blockade umgehen können , diffamiert werden ( vielleicht sogar dieser Mensch selbst ) und dann sieht , wie ein Verein es schafft , innerhalb kürzester Zeit etliche Seiten , die auf den Sperrlisten stehen , vom Netz nehmen zu lassen , also erkennen muss , wie einfach es sein könnte , wenn man denn tatsächlich etwas tun wollte ( Es könnte so einfach sein ) ?
Ich kann diese Fragen nicht beantworten , ich kann nur sagen , wie es mir damit geht .
Es hinterlässt bei mir ein mehr als galliges Gefühl im Mund , dass die Sicherheitshysterie und Machtgeilheit einiger Politiker dazu geführt hat , dass man Angst davor haben muss , was passiert , wenn man tatsächlich einmal schreibt , wie man über vieles denkt .
Es führt nicht unbedingt zu mehr Appetit bei mir , wenn ich lese , wie einfach es ist , manche Seiten vom Netz nehmen zu lassen , was aber von Leuten wie Frau von der Leyen nicht einmal vorangetrieben wird , wie es scheint .
Und ich weiß ganz genau , warum mir im Moment " To be a somebody " ( aus der Serie " Cracker " ) , " Fight Club " , " Falling Down " und " Sleepers " ( um nur eigene zu nennen ) in den Sinn kommen .
Liebe Frau von der Leyen , liebe sonstigen Symbolpolitiker , vielleicht ist es für euch nicht nachvollziehbar ( oder es ist euch egal ) , aber ich bin der Meinung , ihr lähmt nicht nur das Land , ihr zerstört es - egal ob es um die Wirtschaft geht , um den inneren Zusammenhalt ( der für die innere Sicherheit so wichtig ist ) , um Kreativität oder um Wissen .
Ihr schnürt der Bevölkerung die Luft ab , ihr bringt sie dazu , dass sie nicht einmal mehr Tränen hat vor ohnmächtiger
Wut , die heruntergeschluckt wird , weil man Angst hat , sich durch diese verdächtig zu machen .
Ihr denkt , dass eine angepasste , stille Bevölkerung vielleicht sogar ein gutes Zeichen ist .
Dem ist nicht so .
Viele richten ihre Aggressionen gegen sich selbst , gegen andere , die nichts dafür können , wie es ihnen geht .
Menschen beißen sich die Zähne kaputt , schneiden sich die Arme auf , verbrennen sich , prügeln auf andere ein , die noch besch ... dran sind als sie selbst .
Aber ich denke , dies ist ein Vorübergang .
Menschen werden verstehen , dass ihnen nicht der HartzIVer den Job wegnimmt , dass nicht der Kritiker der Websperren an Kinderprostitution und Kinderpornografie schuld ist , dass bei der Menge an Hausdurchsuchungen eine solche nichts mehr über den Menschen , bei dem sie stattfand , aussagt ...
Menschen werden verstehen .
Liebe Politiker , ihr habt für solche wie mich nur ein herablassendes Lächeln über , Spott oder Verleumdungen , subtile Hatz ( sollte ich euch Hassprediger nennen ? ) und dergleichen mehr .
Ihr aber habt mein Lächeln und ein paar Tränen .
Denn ihr tut mir leid .
Die Zeiten haben sich , seit das Internet ein Massenmedium ist , verändert .
Menschen vernetzen sich , verständigen sich , halten zueinander , knüpfen Bande , die nichts mit Geld , Arbeit oder Aussehen zu tun haben .
Das erscheint gefährlich , ja .
Und dennoch , dies ist meine Meinung , seid ihr der Meinung , ihr müsst dies bekämpfen .
Statt dies auch schlichtweg zum Wohle aller zu nutzen .
Schade eigentlich .
Und deshalb - und aus persönlichen Gründen - ein kleiner Musiktipp ( Twister ( Bettina Winsemann ) )
There are no fast solutions – either for the US economy or for individuals trying to rebuild retirement funds clobbered by the falling stock market .
That was the message from Mark Zandi , one of the nation ’s top economists .
Mr. Zandi is co-founder and chief economist of Economy .
Com , a firm that provides various kinds of research to individual , business , and corporate clients .
He was the guest at a Monitor - sponsored breakfast for reporters on Thursday
Waiting and waiting for the Dow
How long will it take the stock market to recover ?
“ It could be a decade , ” Zandi said .
“ If I were an individual thinking about the size of my nest egg , and what I would need for retirement , I think the appropriate assumption is that I am going to get 5 percent annualized returns on my assets . ”
Many investors enjoyed much faster growth before the stock market collapsed .
For the US economy , things are getting “ measurably worse , ” Zandi said .
He predicted 2009 would be a “ very difficult year -- washout , ” with the economy contracting 2.5 percent .
That is twice as big a decline in economic activity as the Obama Administration predicts in its budget .
Growth again in 2011
As for 2010 , “ I do n’t think we go anywhere -- basically a flat year , ” Zandi says .
He added , “ I think we get growth in 2011 . ”
Zandi has bipartisan credentials .
He was an advisor to the McCain presidential campaign in 2008 .
The New York Times recently referred to him as a McCain campaign adviser who has become the Democrats ’ favorite economist because , unlike Mr. McCain , he backs the stimulus spending .
Zandi gave a presentation at last week ’s White House fiscal summit .
Too small a boost
He thinks the stimulus package that Mr. Obama signed February 17 should have been bigger .
Its $ 787 billion size was “ a reasonable number maybe three months ago given the consensus forecast at that time , ” Zandi said .
But “ in the context of our current forecast it feels too small to me .
I would have made it larger , probably closer to a trillion dollars and I would have increased it with tax cuts . ”
The Obama administration has done an inadequate job selling the various programs it has put in place to help financial institutions and consumers , Zandi said .
“ All of these policy efforts matter in terms of the dollars and cents .
But the key thing is , does it convince people , is it going to shore up confidence or at least stabilize confidence ?
If there was a criticism it is that the administration has n’t sold these policy efforts well enough , ” he said .
Get busy on the deficit now
When asked if the government would be able to sell all of the debt it will need to cover massive budget deficits , he replied cautiously .
“ In 2009 , yes .
In 2010 , probably because no one else is borrowing , ” he said .
But the White House and Congress should take speedy action to deal with large projected budget deficits in future years , Zandi warned .
“ If we do n’t make concrete progress with respect to our long term fiscal situation in the next year , then interest rates will rise beginning in 2010 and certainly 2011 and 2012 when the economy finds its footing and we go from deflation to inflation .
And the dollar will probably fall in value at [ that ] time , exacerbating the inflationary situation and the higher interest rates .
So it is key for policy makers to make really concrete progress with respect to the long - run budget situation in 2009 . ”
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - U.S. prosecutors want swindler Bernard Madoff and his wife Ruth to forfeit more than $ 100 million worth of homes , cars , boats , securities , silverware and a piano following his March 12 guilty plea , according to court papers .
The address of the building where Bernard Madoff lives can be seen in New York March 6 , 2009 .

Homes in Manhattan , Palm Beach , Florida , Cap d’Antibes , France and on New York ’s Long Island , valued at a total of $ 22 million , $ 17 million in a bank account and at least $ 45 million in COHMAD Securities Corp , a brokerage part - owned by Bernard Madoff , are on the government ’s list seen on Monday .
The 70 - year - old Madoff , a former Nasdaq stock market chairman , was jailed Thursday after a dramatic courtroom guilty plea in Manhattan federal court to running the biggest investment fraud in Wall Street history that drew in as much as $ 65 billion over 20 years .
His sentencing on 11 criminal charges is scheduled for June 16 , when he could be imprisoned for the rest of his life .
Separately , the court - appointed trustee winding down the firm , Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC , said he would need a lawyer to track down assets in Gibraltar .
“ The trustee has become aware of assets he believes to be customer property located within that country and requires counsel to pursue such customer property , ” the filing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York on Monday said .
The U.S. government ’s “ notice of intent to seek forfeiture of certain assets ” also cites a Cayman Islands company called Yacht Bull Corp , three boats valued at more than $ 10 million , four cars , $ 65,000 in silverware and a Steinway piano worth $ 39,000 .
In a court filing in early March , the Madoffs ’ lawyers said $ 69 million in property and accounts belonged to Ruth Madoff and was unrelated to the fraud .
For each of the properties , the government notice said “ all insured and readily salable personal property contained therein ” were included as items subject to forfeiture .
Ruth Madoff ’s lawyer , Peter Chavkin , declined to comment on the government ’s notice .
Bernard Madoff ’s lawyers were not immediately available to comment .
In court papers on Friday , lawyers for Bernard Madoff argued for his release pending sentencing .
A list of assets filed with the appeal put the net worth of Madoff and his wife between $ 823 million and $ 826 million .
Madoff ’s business and personal assets were frozen following his December 11 arrest .
A court - appointed trustee winding down the firm said last month he had recovered about $ 946.4 million for former customers .
The case is USA v Madoff 09 - 213 U.S. District Court for the Southern District Court of New York ( Manhattan ) and case 08-01789 in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in the same district .
According to the Wikileaks private message trail it is claimed that Hanley has published a detailed online diary of her travels to Europe last year , which included attending several neo -Nazi skinhead gatherings , visiting Adolf Hitler 's birthplace , placing flowers on his parents ' grave and collecting Nazi memorabilia .
" Hearing / joining in with so many hundreds of people chanting Sieg Heil together is something that will stay with me forever , " she allegedly wrote .
The online messages allegedly reveal that Hanley has also hosted international Blood & Honour activists at her house in Canberra and dated several neo -Nazi skinheads .
Blood & Honour , which promotes neo -Nazi music and events , was founded in Britain in 1987 and has been outlawed in Germany and Spain .
Its Australian chapter is organising a pro-Hitler gig in Perth for Anzac Day .
In one of her online messages , Hanley is reported as saying that she would like to become " more active in supporting B&H Australia " .
" I think that with my skills and background I would have a lot to offer , " she wrote .
" Nothing would make me happier than to see B&H Australia become stronger and larger .
I would also love to see the skinhead scene in Australia return back to the size and strength of the glory days . "
Even though the Department of Defence conducted background checks on all Thales contractors , claims about Hanley 's links with neo -Nazi skinhead groups were unknown to Thales or the department until smh.com .au provided copies of the private messages .
Thales immediately began an investigation and suspended Hanley , who is in her 40s , saying it took security " extremely seriously " .
It said the matter had been referred to " appropriate authorities for further investigation " .
" The person in question was a contractor engaged through an employment agency , " a Thales spokeswoman said .
" The contract has been suspended and all access to Thales IT and equipment removed . "
The Department of Defence said it could not comment on security allegations relating to specific people , but would have concerns about employees known to have links with nationalist extremist or racial organisations .
It would not comment on Hanley 's security clearance level .
In another message attributed to her she discussed how she listened to a white supremacist online radio show .
Reached at her home on Friday and this morning , Hanley refused to comment on the allegations and threatened legal action over any future reports based on the material published by Wikileaks .
" I 'm under legal advice not to speak to you , " she said , before hanging up .
Thales , which refused to give any further details about the investigations or about Hanley , generates about $ 1 billion in revenues annually and specialises in high technology defence products such as electronic warfare , munitions and protected mobility vehicles .

Fight dem back , said bad economic times were always a fertile recruitment ground for racist groups .
Die Deutsche Telekom arbeitet mit Hochdruck an einer Einigung mit dem Bundesfamilienministerium im Streit um eine " freiwillige Vereinbarung " zur Blockade kinderpornografischer Webseiten .
" Wir wollen eine Lösung finden für das Problem " , erklärte ein Sprecher des Bonner Konzerns gegenüber heise online .
Die Gespräche würden aber noch laufen , sodass derzeit keine Informationen etwa über die Einschätzung eines Eckpunktepapiers für eine spätere gesetzliche Regelung veröffentlicht werden könnten .
Zuvor hatte der Sprecher eingeräumt , dass es bei der Telekom noch rechtliche Bedenken gegen das von Bundesfamilienministerin Ursula von der Leyen ( CDU ) immer wieder mit Nachdruck eingeforderte Vertragskonstrukt gebe .
Er begrüßte , dass Bundesjustizministerin Brigitte Zypries ( SPD ) entsprechende Vorbehalte in einer ersten Stellungnahme an das Familienressort aufgegriffen habe .
Zypries hatte Ende vergangener Woche vor " erheblichen verfassungsrechtlichen Risiken " bei der vom Familienministerium bevorzugten Selbstverpflichtung von Providern zur " Erschwerung des Zugangs zu kinderpornografischen Inhalten im Internet " gewarnt .
Staatlich veranlasste , durch Sperrungen bedingte massive Grundrechtseingriffe würden sich damit nicht wegzaubern lassen .
Zudem habe das Bundeskriminalamt ( BKA ) , das nach Vorstellung von der Leyens die schwarze Liste zu blockierender Seiten führen soll , keine Befugnisse in diesem präventiv ausgerichteten Bereich .
Von der Leyen hatte am Wochenende trotzdem angegeben , dass erste Verträge zur Zugangserschwerung zu Kinderpornografie mit einzelnen Providern unterschriftsreif seien .
Unterstützung für ihr Vorhaben hatte die Christdemokratin zuvor vor allem von Vodafone erfahren .
Der Verband der deutschen Internetwirtschaft eco drängt indes weiter im Einklang mit Zypries auf ein ordentliches Gesetzgebungsverfahren , falls Websperren politisch allgemein gewünscht seien .
Die vom Familienressort allein angekündigte Verabschiedung eines Umrisses eines später eventuell folgenden Gesetzesentwurfs bringe für die Provider aber weder Planungs - noch Rechtssicherheit .
Spätere Änderungen durch die Regierung oder das Parlament an den Eckpunkten könnten gewaltig sein beziehungsweise die Verabschiedung eines entsprechenden Gesetzes nie erfolgen , heißt es bei der Branchenvereinigung .
Zugangsanbieter , die eine vertragliche Lösung mitsamt einer mehr oder weniger erzwungenen Zustimmung zu geänderten Allgemeinen Geschäftsbedingungen ( AGB ) unterschreiben würden , müssten zudem mit Sicherheit mit Klagen betroffener Nutzer rechnen .
In den abschließenden Verhandlungen mit dem Familienministerium in großer Runde ist laut Ansicht von eco-Vertretern ferner klar geworden , dass es den bislang beteiligten Ressorts einschließlich des Wirtschafts - und Innenministeriums nicht nur um die von Experten als wirkungslos erachteten Sperrungen im Bereich Kinderpornographie gehe .
Von einer entsprechenden Beschränkung sei nicht mehr die Rede gewesen .
Somit stünde die Tür offen für Blockadeforderungen etwa auch von Rechteinhabern im Kampf gegen Copyright - Verstößen im Netz oder von den Betreibern staatlich genehmigter Glücksspieleanbieter gegen die illegale Online - Konkurrenz .

On Tuesday , April 7th , the MN Senate Election Contest Court sat down at 9:30 AM CT with 387 absentee ballots and began the tedious process of opening , sorting and counting their contents .
The counting process did not began for some time , but when it did , the court had identified 351 ballots which merited inclusion into the vote tally .
The ECC court released the following order detailing the specific voters contained within the 351 identified ballots :
This matter comes before the Court after its review of certain original absentee ballot materials pursuant to this Court 's Order for Delivery of Ballots to Office of the Minnesota Secretary of State for Review by the Court .
After review , IT IS HEREBY ORDERED : 1 . The absentee ballots in the attached Exhibit A shall be opened and counted in accordance with Paragraph 4 of the Court 's Order for Delivery of Ballots to Office of the Minnesota Secretary of State for Review by the Court .
2 . Any other relief not fully set forth herein is expressly denied .
Dated : April 7 , 2009 [ Exhibit A : List of 351 Voter 's Names and County , CSV ] Source : Order for Opening and Counting of Ballots via MNCourts.gov
Parsing through the list revealed that 41 of the 42 Nauen Petitioner 's identified within the ECC 's request were also listed within the ECC 's order for opening and counting .
Each of the 41 voter 's is assumed to have voted for Franken because the Franken campaign was funding their intervention .
This leaves 310 voters with unknown allegiances ; 10 of the 12 voter 's identified within Contestee 's [ Franken ] Partial Summary Judgment are also listed within this 310 vote subset .
I updated my extrapolation to account for the 41 Nauen Petitioner 's and the remaining 310 voters ; I assume that the Nauen voters will break for Franken in a 90 - 5 - 5 fashion and that the 10 Partial Summary Judgement voters have no inclination to vote for one candidate or another :

Identified Extrapolation Voters Coleman Franken ECC Ordered Opened 310 130.66 129.33 Coleman Regions 190 91.85 66.61 Franken Regions 120 38.82 62.72 Nauen Petitioners 41 2.05 36.90 Newly Orded 6 .30 5.40 Previously Ordered 35 1.75 31.50 Extrapolation Total 351 132.71 166.23 Actual Result 351 111 198
The Pioneer Press and the Star Tribune have both reported that the final resolution of these 351 ballots resulted in Franken increasing his lead by 87 votes from 225 , to 312 .
At this point it seems unlikely that further ballots will be opened and counted , but the possibility does remain .
The ECC also has yet to address the 133 ( or 134 ) lost ballots in Minneapolis W3 - P1 and any remedy to the Coleman campaign 's argument of double counted ballots .
It seems unlikely that a ruling will be released today , as the ECC just released an order clarifying the resolution of the Nauen Petitioners :
This action came on for a court trial before the Honorable Elizabeth A. Hayden , the Honorable Kurt J. Marben , and the Honorable Denise D. Reilly , District Court Judges , beginning on January 26 , 2009 and ending on March 13 , 2009 .
Having considered the testimony and evidence adduced at trial , the exhibits admitted into evidence , the pleadings , ' briefs and memoranda submitted by all the parties , and the arguments of counsel , the Court now makes the following : ORDER 1 .
Petitioners filed a Petition pursuant to Minnesota Statute section 204B.44 with the Minnesota Supreme Court on January 13 , 2009 .
On January 16 , 2009 , the Minnesota Supreme Court issued an order granting Norm Coleman 's motion to intervene in Petitioners ' proceeding and further directing the Petition to this Court for consideration and decision within the current election contest .
2 . Pursuant to the Court 's Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part Petitioners ' Motion for Summary Judgment ( Feb. 10 , 2009 ) , Nunc Pro Tunc Order Correcting Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part Petitioners ' Motion for Summary Judgment ( Feb. 10 , 2009 ) .

On March 31 , 2009 , the Court Issued an Order for Delivery of Ballots to .
Office of the Minnesota Secretary of State for Review by the Court .
The Petitioners listed above were identified in the Court 's March 31 , 2009 Order .
[ List of 36 Voter 's Names and County , CSV ] 4 .
On - April 7 , 2009 , the Court ordered the absentee ballot return envelopes of voters identified in an attached exhibit to be opened and counted by the Office of the Secretary of State in open court and the totals included in the results of the 2008 United States Senate election reported by the Minnesota Secretary of State .
With one exception , the ballots of the individuals listed above were opened , sorted and counted by the Office of the Secretary of State in open court on April 7 , 2009 , pursuant to the Court 's March 31 , 2009 and April 7 , 2009 Orders.1
5 . With respect to the Petitioners not expressly identified herein , the Court has not been presented with sufficient individualized evidence in support of Petitioners ' claims .
The Petition with respect to those individuals is accordingly DISMISSED .
6 . Any request for relief in these proceedings not specifically granted herein is denied .
There being no just reason for delay .
LET JUDGMENT BE ENTERED ACCORDINGLY .
Dated : April 10 , 2009 1 The absentee ballot return envelope of Roxanna Saad of Dakota County was not opened and counted on April 7 , 2009 , after the Court determined Ms. Saad failed to fully complete a voter registration application .
Source : Order Regarding Resolution of Petitioner 's Motion via MNCourts.gov
The above order details the 36 petitioner 's listed within previous orders granting the opening and counting of their ballots , a number I arrived at on Monday .
The final count , as noted above , included 35 of the 36 plus 6 other petitioners who had not previously been granted relief .
This brings the grand total of relieved Nauen Petitioners to 41 .
I 've updated my Nauen voter table to reflect the result of the counting procedure ; the contents of this most recent order did not reveal any new information .
It simply outlined the result of the Nauen Petitioner 's and dismissed the remaining petitioner 's request for relief :
Extrapolation : Nauen Petitioners and ECC Ordered Opened & Counted Aftermath [ PDF , 125KB ]
Despite the ECC 's detailed and straightforward resolution of the Nauen Petioners , Rachel E. Stassen - Berger of the St. Paul Pioneer Press still managed to a provide inaccurate information :
The order the court did issue today dismissed the case of the voters who sued on their own but have n't had their ballots counted .
Sixty - one voters sued early this year to have their absentee ballot votes counted .
That suit , which was funded by Franken , was folded into Coleman 's larger suit .
Thirty - six of those voters had their ballots opened and counted on Tuesday , along with 315 other absentee ballots .
The results on those ballots boosted Franken 's lead to 312 votes .
Today , the judges said that the case of the other 25 votes was dismissed .
[ emphasis added to depict inaccuracies ]
Source : St. Paul Pioneer Press
Rachel 's entire article contained just 217 words , but three glaring inaccuracies :
1 . There were 64 Nauen petitioners , not " sixty - one ; " although three voters did eventually withdraw their claim .
Exhibit A : List of 64 Voters by Name and County , [ CSV , 2KB ]
Source : Petition by Certain MN Voters to Have Their Votes Counted via MNCourts.gov
2. Forty - one of the Nauen petitioners eventually had their vote counted ; the " thirty - six " Rachel presents originates from today 's order and tells me that she cannot read footnotes .
Thirty - six voters were originally presented , but Roxanna Saad 's ballot was never counted because it did not contain a completed voter registration form .
3 . The " 25 " other votes should actually read 23 , but its hard to get this number right , when the two previous numbers were completely wrong ; 64-41=23 .
The ECC will probably present their ruling some time next week , at that point , the loser will have 10 days to present an appeal to the MN Supreme Court .

World Bank President and Bilderberg elitist Robert Zoellick openly admitted the plan to eliminate national sovereignty and impose a global government during a speech on the eve of the G20 summit .
Speaking about the agenda to increase not just funding but power for international organizations on the back of the financial crisis , Zoellick stated , “ If leaders are serious about creating new global responsibilities or governance , let them start by modernising multilateralism to empower the WTO , the IMF , and the World Bank Group to monitor national policies . ”
In other words , give global institutions the power to regulate national policy as part of the creation of global government .
What Zoellick is outlining is essentially the end of national sovereignty and the reclassification of national governments as mere subordinates to a global authority that is completely unaccountable to the voting public of any country .
[ efoods ]
The more cynical amongst us would call this a global dictatorship .
Zoellick couches the plan in flowery rhetoric of helping the poor and alleviating poverty , but as we have documented for years , the global elite ’s goal of world government has little to do with saving the planet and everything to do with creating a global fascist state .
Zoellick , former Executive Vice President of Fannie Mae and advisor to Goldman Sachs , is a top elitist who was intimately involved in the Enron scandal and the 2000 presidential election debacle .
He was also a signatory to the Project For A New American century document that called for invading Iraq as part of implementing a brutal world empire in 1998 .
He was later a foreign policy advisor to George W. Bush .
As to be expected , Zoellick is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and the Trilateral Commission .
He also attended the annual invitation - only conferences of the Bilderberg Group in 1991 , 2003 , 2006 and 2007 .
Meanwhile , British Prime Minister Gordon Brown will use the G20 summit in London to extend an olive branch to China , offering them a central role in the construction of a new world order and a global government , according to reports .
“ Brown will hold talks with Hu Jintao , China ’s president , following discussions with Barack Obama , amid signs that developing countries see the G20 summit as a chance to impose a new world order and end the era of Anglo - European dominance , ” reports the Guardian .
Under the proposal , China will vastly increase its IMF funding in return for more voting rights .
A central focus of the G20 summit will be the proposal to supplant the dollar with a new global currency .
Both the IMF and the United Nations threw their weight behind the implementation of a new global reserve currency system to replace the dollar , in the same week that Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner told CFR globalists that he was “ open ” to the idea .
China and Russia brought the issue to the forefront of this week ’s G20 when they jointly called for a new global reserve currency a week ago .
Brown has consistently called for global regulation of the financial system as a means towards global governance .
In a speech at St Paul ’s Cathedral in London yesterday he again called for a new “ global society ” .

WIRED25 2020 : Maria Ressa on Freedom of Speech , Misinformation , and the Immense Power of Facebook
Maria Ressa spoke with Steven Levy at WIRED25 about the numerous trumped - up charges facing her and her publication , Rappler , and the terrible power Facebook can have when used by bad actors .

Science reporter , BBC News
Bwindi Community Hospital staff with the traditional birth attendants and healers
" When I arrived here , I saw people with HIV being carried all day to get to the clinic , " Paul Williams recalls .
" There were no testing services , no education , no treatment and certainly no monitoring of treatment .
People just died . "
That was the situation in Bwindi , Uganda , three years ago .
Dr Williams , formerly a GP in North - East England , has since transformed a tiny and very basic health centre on the edge of the Impenetrable Forest into an efficient community hospital .
The hospital 's community team takes HIV testing kits out to remote villages
And for the past five months , thanks to a small but important piece of equipment , Dr Williams ' medical team has been able to monitor the health of patients with HIV from a clinic that fits into the back of their four - wheel - drive " community ambulance " .
Bwindi Community Hospital now provides health care for about 40,000 people .
It has a dedicated maternity programme and a children 's ward that deals with many cases of malnutrition , as well as other common diseases including malaria and HIV .
In total , the hospital takes care of 1,000 HIV positive patients .
Dr Williams describes the environment in which he works : " We 're a mile away from the rainforest where there are mountain gorillas , right on the border between Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo .
" There are n't any tarmac roads here , there is n't any public transport , and lots of the patients live a day 's walk from the hospital .
Many of them live a subsistence existence and they can't afford to get here . "
So his team packs an " HIV outreach clinic " into its vehicle , and takes it out to remote communities .
Along with the rest of the equipment loaded into the back and strapped on to the roof of the ambulance , there is one modest - looking grey box .
This piece of equipment is a PointCare NOW machine .
It was donated to the hospital last year , and has since transformed the care Dr Williams can offer HIV patients .
The hospital is on the edge of the Bwindi Impenetrable Forest
The machine is a portable blood - testing device - pop in a blood sample and , within 10 minutes , it gives a print - out detailing the condition of a patient 's immune system .
It counts CD4 positive T cells .
These are the white blood cells that the HIV virus latches on to - attacking and destroying them .
" When we say someone has a weak immune system because of HIV , we mean their number of CD4 cells is low , " explains Dr Williams .
" During the course of infection , the number of these cells gets less and less - so you have to count them to see how advanced the HIV is . "
The quest
The machine was developed by PointCare , a company based in the US that specialises in diagnostic equipment for the developing world .
It 's an organisation with an impressive pedigree .
Petra Krauledat , and her long - time business partner Peter Hansen , founded the company in 2003 , having both already had long and successful careers in HIV research .
What people needed was a test that could be used in a little shack of a clinic , transported to remote areas , and that could withstand the heat
Petra Krauledat
PointCare " Peter invented the first automated CD4 test in the late 1970s , and I led the group in 1982 , in Germany , that launched the first HIV screening test in Europe , " explains Dr Krauledat .
In the 1990s they were approached by former colleagues who asked them to turn their attention to developing a much - needed , cheap CD4 test for the developing world .
" So we went to Southern Africa to talk to the [ medics ] actually working there , " she says .
What they found surprised them both .
" People showed us tonnes of donated instruments just sat in storage .
The reagents [ or chemicals needed to run the tests ] had simply perished in the heat , " she relates .
" So ' cheap ' was n't people 's biggest concern .
What they needed was a test that could be used in a little shack of a clinic , transported to remote areas , and that could withstand the high temperatures .
" We 've fulfilled that quest . "
Surviving the heat Dr Hansen invented a test that uses chemical reagent that can be freeze - dried and stored in temperatures of over 40C .
CD4 screening tests use antibodies - molecular tags that recognise and latch onto a chemical marker on the surface of the cell .
By attaching to the cells , they act as flags distinguishing CD4 cells from other white blood cells .
Before the outreach programme , patients would walk to the hospital
But these antibodies need to be " labelled " , so they can be detected by a machine .
Traditionally , antibodies are labelled using fluorescent markers , but these fluorescent chemicals perish if they are not kept refrigerated .
So they 're useless for a medical team operating from a temporary clinic in the heat of an African summer .
Dr Hansen developed a new label .
" We use colloidal gold , " explains Dr Krauledat .
" It 's true nanotechnology - extremely tiny gold particles attached to the anti-CD4 antibody . "
The gold - bound antibodies are very heat - stable - they can be stored at over 42C for an entire year .
Immediate result Inside the PointCare machine , the freeze - dried , gold - labelled antibody is liquefied and combined with the blood sample , and with a chemical accelerator that speeds up the attachment of the antibody to the cells .
" How the accelerator works is a trade secret , but it allows us to complete the test within eight minutes , " says Dr Krauledat .
The device gives a result within 10 minutes " Before we had this machine , we 'd see somebody in the clinic , then we'd have to see them on another day to collect a blood sample , " recalls Dr Williams .
" We had a system of motorcycle riders that went round all of our outreach sites on a particular day to collect samples .
They would have to ride for four hours along a muddy road through the Impenetrable Forest , to a laboratory on the other side , where we could get them tested .
" It took us three days to get the result , and we could n't get it back to the patient until we saw them again two weeks later .
" Now , with this simple piece of technology , we can deal with problems immediately . "
The machine is also far cheaper to run than traditional instruments .
It is powered via a battery pack .
" Because we use colloidal gold , we have an instrument that does n't consume a lot of power , " explains Dr Krauledat .
" Fluorescently labelled antibodies have to be detected with a laser , and those systems are quite fragile and consume more power .
We use a [ light - emitting diode ] detector .
It 's technology with a lifetime of 180,000 days , does n't break and it uses almost no power . "
' Productive lives '
As well as a CD4 count , the device also counts five other subtypes of white blood cell .
This gives a complete picture of the patient 's immune system .
The results provide a physician with a good indication of whether an HIV positive patient might have tuberculosis , give a warning sign of other opportunistic infections , and find out if the patient has anaemia - a debilitating condition that is fairly common in the latter stages of HIV .
We 've been able to change HIV from being a death sentence to being something that people can live with and lead productive lives
Paul Williams
Bwindi Community Hospital
It also means that a patient 's treatment can be monitored .
" HIV treatment is great - anti-retroviral drugs can add up to 30 years to a person 's life , " says Dr Williams .
" But there are some people who develop resistance to the drugs , or in whom the drugs fail , and we can spot that early on to take action to be able to stop them from getting sick . "
In three years , Dr Williams and his team have transformed the lives of their HIV positive patients .
" I started a testing centre in the hospital , then the mobile testing services , and then , once we had access to drugs , developed a treatment programme .
" Now our death rates from HIV are very low .
We 're able to diagnose it early , manage it early and keep people living with HIV fit and well .
" Over a reasonably short period of time , we 've been able to change HIV from being a death sentence into something that people can live with and lead productive lives . "

From last month 's journal Evolution , a fascinating tale of slave rebellion among ants kidnapped by other ant species and forced to work for the rival colony :
When these youngsters mature , they take on the odour of their abductors and become the servants of the enslaving queen .
They take over the jobs of maintaining the colony and caring for its larvae even though they are from another species ; they even take part in raids themselves .
But like all slave - traders , P.americanus faces rebellions .
Some of its victims ( ants from the genus Temnothorax ) strike back with murderous larvae .
Alexandra Achenbach and Susanne Foitzik from Ludwig Maximillians Universty in Munich found that some of the kidnapped workers do n't bow to the whims of their new queen .
Once they have matured , they start killing the pupae of their captors , destroying as many as two - thirds of the colony 's brood …
Two - thirds of pupae died before they hatched .
The mortality rate was even higher ( 83 % ) for pupae containing queens , but very low ( 3 % ) for those containing males .
The duo saw that the captives were deliberately killing the healthy pupae .
In about 30 % of cases , as in the photo , the workers would gang up to literally pull the developing ants apart .
Another 53 % of the pupae were killed by neglect , by workers who moved them out of the nest chamber .
These murders were solely the acts of the slaves .
No P.americanus worker ever lifted a mandible against its own pupae .
Nor are the deaths a reflection of a generally poor standard of care on the part of Temnothorax .
In their own colonies , the majority of pupae hatched , with just 3 - 10 % dying before that happened .
Following my last post , many people seemed to be confused over what should be a relatively simple concept – what happens when you place a 400 mm lens ( in true focal length ) on either a full frame 35 mm dSLR vs a 2 x cropped sensor such as an Olympus or Panasonic dSLR .
First , what does not change significantly or at all :
perspective at the same subject distance
if you focus on a subject at a given distance with a lens of the same focal length , then , the size of background objects will be the same in comparison to the subject size
HOWEVER , if because of a 2 x cropped sensor which effectively magnifies your subject 2x , you choose to move away from the subject to keep the subject the same size in the viewfinder as on the full frame , then changing subject distance WILL CHANGE PERSPECTIVE .
depth of field at same aperture and subject distance
actually depth of field may actually be reduced if the final image is printed to the same size from each camera and viewed at from the same distance , as DOF is dependent also on the final viewed image magnification – the greater the magnification , the more evident the out of focus areas appear as out of focus
HOWEVER , if because of a 2 x cropped sensor which effectively magnifies your subject 2x , you choose to move away from the subject to keep the subject the same size in the viewfinder as on the full frame , then changing subject distance WILL INCREASE DEPTH OF FIELD which can be a good thing when using super telephoto reach – a big advantage for 2 x cropped sensors ( not so good for short focal length situations where you wish to blur the background though )
aperture
Now let ’s look at what DOES change substantially :
image field of view
how wide a view you see in the viewfinder and in the final print is ONLY dependent on the true focal length and the sensor size ( assuming that the design of the lens has an image circle which covers the sensor diagonal )
angle of view = 2 x arctan [ ( 0.5 x sensor dimension ) / true focal length of lens ]
thus , for a 300 mm lens , the diagonal angle of view is 8.2 degrees on a full frame and 4.1 degrees on a 2 x crop sensor HENCE the term “ 2 x crop ” , of course you could use “ digital zoom ” in post - processing , or in some cameras , within the camera to give a 2 x crop image size and thus field of view from a full frame dSLR but thus will have 1 /4 of the number of pixels of the full frame image
subject magnification at the same subject distance – “ telephoto reach ”
the comparative size of the subject at the same distance will be twice as much in a 2 x crop sensor as on a full frame because of the angle of view issues , but in the final image on screen or in print when enlarged to the same pixels per inch enlargement , the subject size is dependent also on the pixel density of the sensor
if using sensors with the SAME number of pixels , then subject magnification will be 2 x for a 2 x cropped sensor , thus giving a substantial advantage to the cropped sensor when telephoto reach is important BUT at a cost of smaller sensor photosites resulting in more image noise at higher ISO and less dynamic range ( assuming the same sensor technologies )
if the full frame sensor had 4 x the number of pixels of the 2 x cropped sensor , assuming same technology , they will both have the same photosite size , same noise at high ISO and same dynamic range , and if you cropped the full frame image to half its diameter you should give the SAME subject magnification , DOF , perspective as on a 2 x crop sensor , BUT what will be different is the optical resolution and aberrations as physics dictates that these will be easier to make to higher specifications on a lens with a smaller image circle ( as long as you do not use such a small aperture that the laws of diffraction adversely effect resolution – smaller than f /8 on 2 x crop ) .
thus even if Canon or Nikon made a 40 mp full frame dSLR which would allow telephoto reach magnification of an Olympus 10 mp dSLR when cropped and give the option of a full frame image with twice the angle of view , there are unlikely to be any lenses made that could deliver that optical resolution and thus the image will lack the detail of the Olympus image ( assuming you are using a ZD lens and not a legacy 35 mm lens ) – current 35 mm zoom lenses struggle to deliver 16 mp optical resolution let alone 25 mp or 40 mp
( assuming you are using a ZD lens and not a legacy 35 mm lens ) – current 35 mm zoom lenses struggle to deliver 16 mp optical resolution let alone 25 mp or 40 mp
perhaps a bigger question would be – can a Canon 5DMII with EF 400 mm f/5.6 lens provide the same image detail at the same subject distance as a 12 mp Olympus E620 / E - 30 / E - 3 with a ZD 50 - 200 mm lens with a 2x TC ?
– can a Canon 5DMII with EF 400 mm f/5.6 lens provide the same image detail at the same subject distance as a 12 mp Olympus E620 / E - 30 / E - 3 with a ZD 50 - 200 mm lens with a 2x TC ?
in my brief experiments , a 10 mp Olympus E510 with a ZD 50 - 200 mm lens with a 2x TC EASILY gives more image detail at same subject distance as a Canon 5DMII with EF 70 - 200 mm f/2.8IS
L lens with 1.4x TC – presumably this lens combination just can’t give 21 mp optical detail .
at same subject distance as a Canon 5DMII with EF 70 - 200 mm f/2.8IS
L lens with 1.4x TC – presumably this lens combination just can’t give 21 mp optical detail .
hand holdable shutter speed
traditionally , the slowest shutter speed advisable for hand held work which still provides reasonable image sharpness is dependent primarily on subject magnification which is a proxy for the amount of image movement from camera shake and thus is usually given as 1 /( focal length )
thus , theoretically , you could use 1/400th sec when using a 400 mm f/5.6 lens on a Canon 5DMII , although , as you are already pushing the limits of optical resolution when trying for a 21 mp image , an even faster shutter speed would be advisable , particularly , given the weight of the lens and the likelihood of muscle fatigue causing increased tremor
the situation with the Olympus ZD 50 - 200 mm when used on an image stabilised body allows much slower shutter speeds – for instance , with a 2xTC at effective 800 mm reach , I usually shoot at 1/200th sec or faster – without the TC , you could shoot at 1/100th sec at 400 mm reach .
This allows lower ISO to be used for static subjects and helps to negate the main downside of the cropped sensors of image noise at high ISO , although for action shots requiring 1/500 - 1/1000th sec you may be forced into the higher ISO regions and more noise – although improving technology should address this in the near future .
lens size and weight
a lens with an image circle to fit a 2 x crop sensor not only can be made to much higher optical resolution and aberration specifications for a given aperture and price point than a 35 mm lens , but can be made smaller and lighter and thus more easily hand held and transported which is a major benefit when it comes to super telephotos
yes , you can get 800 mm reach at f / 8 on a full frame dSLR , but using a 400 mm f / 4 lens with 2x TC or a 600 mm f/4 with 1.4x TC both options are MUCH bigger , heavier , harder to hold and far more expensive than a ZD 50 - 200 mm f/2.8-3.5
Olympus lens with 2x TC – not to mention the Olympus 2x TC is perhaps the best 2x TC made
Well I hope this clarifies a few things although I am sure many will still debate aspects as always on the net .
From the 'it 's not just for servers ' files :
PC - BSD the desktop distro version of FreeBSD , is now out with its 7.1 ' Galileo ' release .
It 's one of the most exciting releases of PC - BSD since 2006 when I first started writing ( and using ) PC - BSD .
The new release is built from FreeBSD 7.2 which just hit beta last week , and uses KDE 4.2.2 as its desktop .
This release has a few incremental improvements including an improved installer , package management , Wi-Fi and networking tools .
There is however at least one feature in PC - BSD 7.2 that I have n't seen before .
Galileo includes something called ' Warden ' which is a utility for FreeBSD server setup .
More specifically it can be used as a graphical front end for virtualized FreeBSD instances -- or jails .
According to iXysystems ( which since 2006 has ' owned ' PC - BSD ) , " The Warden makes jail creation and management accessible to a greater number of users , and provides a secure and isolated environment for all sorts of uses , such as a mail server , database server , or webserver , to name a few .
Warden configurations , called Inmates , can be used to instantly load pre-configured jails into the Warden . "
That 's pretty neat in my opinion and could be the use case that helps to but PC - BSD
7.2 on more enterprise desktops as an admin tool for FreeBSD servers .
With the incremental improvements to existing features , it all amounts to a solid and easier to use version of PC - BSD than past versions .
It 's part of a trend that I 've seen consistently building with PC - BSD since at least the 1.5 release .

The Seagull Nebula
Credit & Copyright : Frank Barrett , Steve Davis
Explanation : Images from two different cameras , a digital SLR and an astronomical CCD camera , are combined in this color starscape .
Both cameras made use of the same telescope at the oceanside Winter Star Party in the Florida Keys , appropriately creating this portrait of the Seagull Nebula .
The wide view covers a 4x3 degree swath across the plane of the Milky Way , near the direction of Sirius , alpha star of the constellation Canis Major .
Of course , the broad region includes objects with other catalog designations : notably NGC 2327 - a compact , dusty emission region with an embedded massive star that forms the bird's head ( above center ) , and IC 2177 - forming the sweeping arc of the seagull 's wings .
Dominated by the reddish glow of atomic hydrogen , the complex of cosmic gas and dust clouds with bright young stars spans over 250 light - years at an estimated 3,800 light - year distance .
EXCLUSIVE :
A battle over control of the party ’s purse strings has erupted at the troubled Republican National Committee , with defenders of Chairman Michael S. Steele accusing dissident RNC members of trying to “ embarrass and neuter ” the party ’s new leader .
Randy Pullen , the RNC ’s elected treasurer , former RNC General Counsel David Norcross and three other former top RNC officers have presented Mr. Steele with a resolution , calling for a new set of checks and balances on the chairman ’s power to dole out money .
The powers include new controls on awarding contracts and spending money on outside legal and other services .
Mr. Steele could not be reached , and a spokesman for the RNC chairman declined to comment on the move .
The resolution prompted a top Steele supporter to issue a scathing attack against Mr. Pullen and his allies after they had asked Mr. Steele to support the “ good governance ” resolution at a special meeting of the full national committee set for next month .
The party spent about $ 300 million in last year ’s elections .
“ I urge you to reject this hostile attempt to embarrass and neuter the chairman of the RNC , ” Wisconsin Republican Party Chairman Reince Priebus wrote in an e-mail to the 168 - member national committee .
Mr. Pullen and his allies need signatures from RNC members from 16 states to force the resolution to the floor for a vote by the full party committee at the May 20 special meeting .
The funding fight comes on the heels of another open challenge to Mr. Steele ’s authority .
Unhappy RNC conservatives secured the signatures to force the committee to convene next month ’s special meeting to vote on a resolution labeling Democrats as “ socialists , ” despite the chairman ’s reservations about the political wisdom of the move .
Critics said the “ socialist ” resolution battle was a sign of Mr. Steele ’s rocky start as RNC chairman and his continuing struggle to assert control of the party ’s message since his election in January .
Steele backers accuse Mr. Pullen and his allies of trying to undermine the chairman and strip him of his rightful authority to spend donors ’ money as he sees fit .
“ This resolution is an attempt to usurp the chairman ’s authority in a completely unprecedented and historic manner , ” Mr. Priebus wrote to the other party chairmen and national committee members from the 50 states and five U.S. territories .
Mr. Priebus , who heads the transition team for the newly elected chairman , also urged the resolution ’s sponsors “ to stop playing political games and begin thinking about what they can do to help our party move forward as we face the elections of 2009 and 2010 . ”
Mr. Pullen gave Mr. Steele the proposed resolution in a private meeting last week .
The sponsors argued that it would help Mr. Pullen and other RNC officers identify and head off questionable financial actions and , thus , insulate party officials from any possible federal prosecution for financial misdeeds done under the aegis of the RNC .
Raising and spending huge sums of money - and doing it in accordance with complex federal campaign and disclosure laws - are central to the mission of the Democratic and Republican national party committees .
The $ 300 million raised by the RNC went to Republican presidential , Senate , House and gubernatorial candidates and to state parties last year .
The spark for the clash came when Mr. Steele replaced longtime RNC Chief Financial Officer Jay Banning , trusted by successive national chairmen and RNC treasurers for nearly 40 years .
The Pullen resolution would make it a written rule that contracts of $ 100,000 or more be open to competitive bidding ; that all checks be signed by two RNC officers ; that party staff be prohibited from signing on behalf of an officer ; and that all contracts be reviewed and approved by the members of the RNC executive committee .
There were signs that Mr. Steele ’s defenders were rising to the challenge .
“ I have confidence in our new chairman and his judgment , ” said Holly J. Hughes , an RNC member from Michigan , in an e-mail to Mr. Pullen .
“ I want to give him a chance before second - guessing him .
I am sorry , but I can not support this . ”
Ginny Haines , an RNC member from New Jersey , wrote , “ Were the policies and procedures which you are asking for in this resolution in place before Chairman Steele , if not , why are they necessary now ? ”
The discord comes as the Republican Party , already on the ropes after defeats in the 2008 elections , was hit with two more blows in recent days - the loss of a close House special election in upstate New York on Friday and the defection of Pennsylvania Sen.
Arlen Specter to the Democrats on Tuesday .
Mr. Steele has been hammered recently for criticizing conservative icon Rush Limbaugh ’s radio show as “ incendiary ” and “ ugly . ”
He then apologized to Mr. Limbaugh , saying his words came out wrong , but later said such apparent mistakes were actually part of a strategy to get his enemies to unmask themselves .
Mr. Steele also has had to defend himself for having belonged to two centrist Republican groups - the Republican Main Street Partnership and the Republican Leadership Council - before running for RNC chairman as a conservative and a reformer .

Apologies for the exegesis , but I would like to formally introduce this piece as what I hope is my first unambiguous abuse of my position as a “ columnist ” .
I had an acquaintance – the partner of a cherished ex-girlfriend – die in tragic circumstances ( not suicide , as it happens ) and the details were pored over hideously and unnecessarily by the media for no reason other than prurience and a desire to make a spectacle of someone else ’s pain .
The media have made it quite clear that they cannot be trusted to report sensibly on coroners ’ inquests , and so they have made it quite clear that they should be expelled from them .
The Telegraph piece discussed below ( which I suppose you can all find if you wish to ) has stayed with me for many months , and rings out as one of the most appalling and foul pieces of reporting I have ever seen .
It was written by someone called Charlotte Bailey .
I suppose you can all find it if you wish to .
I hope I have managed to make this an interesting column despite my indulgence , and I have pasted at the end what I hope is a very powerful piece of research .

The Guardian
This week , in my crescendoing tirade against journalism , we shall review the evidence that the media actually kills people .
The suicide of Sylvia Plath ’s son has filled the news .
The media obsessed – understandably – over genetics , when mental illness is probably the single biggest risk factor , but the coverage has been universally thoughtful , considerate , informed , and responsible .
This is not always the case , as we shall see .
But before we get there , one important cause of suicide seems to have been missed .
In The Sorrows of Young Werthe by Goethe the hero shoots himself because his love is unattainable .
It was banned after men throughout Europe were reported to be dressing like Werther , copying his affectations , and taking their own lives in the same style .
But a myth about a book is not enough : you need research .
And it has been shown repeatedly that suicide increases in the month after a front page suicide story .
There is also evidence that the effect is bigger for famous people and gruesome attempts .
You may want to remember that fact for later .
Details matter , as ever .
Overdoses increased by 17 % in the week after a prominent overdose on Casualty ( watched by 22 % of the population at the time ) , and paracetamol overdoses went up by more than others .
In 1998 the Hong Kong media reported heavily on a case of carbon monoxide poisoning by a very specific method , using a charcoal burner .
In the 10 months preceeding the reports , there had been no such suicides .
In November there were 3 ; then in December there were 10 ; and over the next year there were 40 .
You may want to remember that story for later .
And it ’s not pie in the sky to suggest that the media should be careful in how they discuss suicide .
After the introduction of media reporting guidelines in Austria , for example , there was a significant decrease in the number of people throwing themselves under trains .
So organisations like the Samaritans take this seriously .
They suggest that journalists avoid crass phrases like “ a ‘ successful ’ suicide attempt ” .
They suggest that journalists avoid explicit or technical details of suicide methods , for reasons you can now understand .
They suggest that journalists include details of further sources for help and advice , since an article about suicide represents a great opportunity to target people who are at risk with useful information .
And they recommend avoiding simplistic explanations for suicide .
From the weekly mass of reports that trample on this perfectly good common sense , one article from the Telegraph at the tail end of last year particularly sticks in my memory .
It is very different from the coverage of Sylvia Plath ’s son , and you might have missed it .
“ Man cut off own head with chainsaw ” was the headline : “ A man cut off his head with a chainsaw because he did not want to leave his repossessed home . ”
What followed this headline was not a news story : far from it .
What the Telegraph published was a horrific , comprehensive , explicit , and detailed instruction manual .
In fact this information was so appallingly technical and instructive that after some discussion we have decided that the Guardian will not print it , even in the context of a critique .
It gives truly staggering details on exactly what to buy , how to rig it up , how to use it , and even how to make things more comfortable while waiting for death to come .
Suicidal thoughts are common .
They pass .
Journalists get these kinds of stories from coroners ’ inquests , which are open to the public because we decided , as a community , centuries ago , that it was important to be transparent about the judicial process .
Perhaps Sylvia
Plath ’s son will have a public inquest .
Perhaps the media will cover it in the same way that the Telegraph covered the tragic case of Mr Phyall .
I doubt they will , and I very much hope they wo n’t .
It ’s just hard to tell which is the journalists ’ true voice : the caring , compassionate , informed consolation , or the murderously detailed chainsaw voyeurism .

Relevant papers can be found in the links above .
There is a literature which I think is extremely powerful , and yet unanimously ignored by mainstream media , and that is the follow - up data on what happens later in life to people who have felt so suicidal that they have made serious attempts on their own lives .
In extremis Pajonk et al followed up a large number of people who they picked up in intensive care after very serious suicide attempts .
Amongst those who survived , and did not have serious psychotic illnesses , six years later , the majority were happy and well , living productive family lives , and were – we might reasonably interpolate – glad to be alive .
This is the reality of suicidal thoughts , and this is the kind of thing that people need to be told , in place of detailed instructions on how to kill yourself with a chainsaw .
I hang my head in shame to think that I have ever been called a journalist , and in all honesty I do n’t understand how Charlotte Bailey could write what she did , or why her editor would publish it .
Midday :
to be clear , commenters are absolutely right , my suggestion that the press should be banned from coroners courts outright is poorly thought through .
the end goal is that they should write about this kind of thing a bit more sensibly .
shaming them or regulating them might be another route to make this more likely , and i’d be pleased to hear if people had any other ideas .
The above blink - and - you ’ll - miss - it snippet sliced from today ’s morning commute timelapse footage might seem at first look to be nothing much , so lemme just cut to the chase and let the complaint filed with the MTA tell the whole story :
The operator of MTA Bus No. 8115 on the westbound 333 line at 9:20 a.m. this morning committed several moving violations and demonstrated a blatant disregard for safe driving practices .
I was traveling westbound on Venice Boulevard on my bicycle in the striped Class II bike lane between Ogden and Sawyer when the bus operator from out of view behind me on the left and moving at speed startled me with two illegal honks of the bus horn .
Despite me having position in the lane ahead of him and having the right of way the operator immediately thereafter accelerated to pull abreast of me ( at the intersection of Sawyer and Venice ) and began to bear right encroaching against me while at the same time crossing over into the bike lane and forcing me to take evasive braking and maneuvering in order to prevent the bus from striking me .
The operator continued on with zero concern for the risks he took until crossing completely over to the curb lane ultimately coming to a stop at the northeast corner of the intersection of Venice Boulevard and Fairfax .
Approaching the operator via his window on the left side of the bus ( which he refused to open ) and advising him that the safer more responsible action would be to decrease his speed and pull in behind me , he simply shrugged and pointed to the front of the bus where its number is located .
I told him I ’d already noted it and planned on filing a complaint without delay .
The operator could n’t have cared less .
It ’s entirely disheartening to encounter such sub-quality , aggressive , irresponsible and unrepentant bus operators who do the MTA such a great disservice .
A less - experienced cyclist might have ended up injured or worse because of this operator ’s careless behavior .
As a dedicated bicycle commuter I carry cameras ( handheld and bike - mounted ) with me to document egregious incidents like this .

Last week , Kathy Sierra , a well - known software programmer and Java expert , announced that she had cancelled her speaking engagements and was " afraid to leave my yard " after being threatened with suffocation , rape and hanging .
The threats did n't come from a stalker or a jilted lover and they were n't responses to a controversial book or speech .
Sierra 's harassers were largely anonymous , and all the threats had been made online .
Sierra had been receiving increasingly abusive comments on her website , Creating Passionate Users , over the previous year , but had not expected them to turn so violent - her attackers not only verbally assaulting her ( " fuck off you boring slut . . . I hope someone slits your throat " ) but also posting photomontages of her on other sites : one with a noose next to her head and another depicting her screaming with a thong covering her face .
Since she wrote about the abuse on her website , the harassment has increased .
" People are posting all my private data online everywhere - social - security number , and home address - a retaliation for speaking out . "
While no one could deny that men experience abuse online , the sheer vitriol directed at women has become impossible to ignore .
Extreme instances of stalking , death threats and hate speech are now prevalent , as well as all the everyday harassment that women have traditionally faced in the outside world - cat - calls , for instance , or being " rated " on our looks .
It 's all very far from the utopian ideals that greeted the dawn of the web - the idea of it as a new , egalitarian public space , where men and women from all races , and of all sexualities , could mix without prejudice .
On some online forums anonymity combined with misogyny can make for an almost gang - rape like mentality .
One recent blog thread , attacking two women bloggers , contained comments like , " I would fuck them both in the ass , " ; " Without us you would be raped , beaten and killed for nothing , " ; and " Do n't worry , you or your friends are too ugly to be put on the black market . "
Jill Filipovic , a 23 - year - old law student who also writes on the popular blog , Feministe , recently had some photographs of her uploaded and subjected to abusive comments on an online forum for students in New York .
" The people who were posting comments about me were speculating as to how many abortions I 've had , and they talked about ' hate - fucking ' me , " says Filipovic .
" I do n't think a man would get that ; the harassment of women is far more sexualised - men may be told that they 're idiots , but they are n't called ' whores ' . "
Most disturbing is how accepted this is .
When women are harassed on the street , it is considered inappropriate .
Online , though , sexual harassment is not only tolerated - it 's often lauded .
Blog threads or forums where women are attacked attract hundreds of comments , and their traffic rates rocket .
Is this what people are really like ?
Sexist and violent ?
Misogynist and racist ?
Alice Marwick , a postgraduate student in New York studying culture and communication , says : " There 's the disturbing possibility that people are creating online environments purely to express the type of racist , homophobic , or sexist speech that is no longer acceptable in public society , at work , or even at home . "
Last year I had my own run-in with online sexism when I was invited to a lunch meeting with Bill Clinton , along with a handful of other bloggers .
After the meeting , a group photo of the attendees with Clinton was posted on several websites , and it was n't long before comments about my appearance ( " Who 's the intern ? ; " I do like Gray Shirt 's three - quarter pose . " ) started popping up .
One website , run by law professor and occasional New York Times columnist Ann Althouse , devoted an entire article to how I was " posing " so as to " make [ my ] breasts as obvious as possible " .
The post , titled " Let 's take a closer look at those breasts , " ended up with over 500 comments .
Most were about my body , my perceived whorishness , and how I could n't possibly be a good feminist because I had the gall to show up to a meeting with my breasts in tow .
One commenter even created a limerick about me giving oral sex .
Althouse herself said that I should have " worn a beret . . . a blue dress would have been good too " .
All this on the basis of a photograph of me in a crew - neck sweater from Gap .
I wo n't even get into the hundreds of other blogs and websites that linked to the " controversy . "
It was , without doubt , the most humiliating experience of my life - all because I dared be photographed with a political figure .
But a picture does seem to be considered enough reason to go on a harassment rampage .
Some argue that the increased visibility afforded people by the internet - who does n't have a blog , MySpace page , or Flickr account these days ?
- means that harassment should be expected , even acceptable .
When feminist and liberal bloggers slammed Althouse for her attack on me , she argued that having been in a photo where I was " posing " made me fair game .
When Filipovic complained about her harassment , the site responded : " For a woman who has made 4,000 pictures of herself publicly available on Flickr , and who is a self - proclaimed feminist author of a widely - disseminated blog , she has gotten pretty shy about overexposure . "
Ah , the " she was asking for it " defence .
" I think there 's a tendency to put the blame on the victims of stalking , harassment or even sexual violence when the victim is a woman - and especially when she 's a woman who has made herself public , " says Filipovic .
" Public space has traditionally been reserved for men , and women are supposed to be quiet . "
Sierra thinks that online threats , even if they are coming from a small group of people , have tremendous potential to scare women from fully participating online .
" How many rape / fantasy threats does it take to make women want to lay low ?
Not many , " she says .
But even women who do n't put their pictures or real names online are subject to virtual harassment .
A recent study showed that when the gender of an online username appears female , they are 25 times more likely to experience harassment .
The study , conducted by the University of Maryland , found that female user - names averaged 163 threatening and / or sexually explicit messages a day .
" The promise of the early internet , " says Marwick , " was that it would liberate us from our bodies , and all the oppressions associated with prejudice .
We 'd communicate soul - to - soul , and get to know each other as people , rather than judging each other based on gender or race . "
In reality , what ended up happening was that , online , the default identity became male and white - unless told otherwise , you would assume you were talking to a white man .
" So people who brought up their ethnicity , or people who complained about sexism in online communications , were seen as ' playing the race / gender card ' or trying to stir up trouble , " says Marwick .
And while online harassment does n't necessarily create the same immediate safety concerns as street harassment , the consequences are arguably more severe .
If someone calls you a " slut " on the street , it stings - but you can move on .
If someone calls you a " slut " online , there 's a public record as long as the site exists .
Let me tell you , it 's not easy to build a career as a feminist writer when you have people coming up to you in pubs asking if you 're the " Clinton boob girl " or if one of the first items that comes up in a Google search of your name is " boobgate " .
And for young women applying for jobs , the reality is terrifying .
Imagine a potential employer searching for information and coming across a thread about what a " whore " you are .
Thankfully , women are fighting back .
Sparked by the violent harassment of Sierra , one blogger started a " stop cyberbullying " campaign .
This was picked up by hundreds of other bloggers and an international women 's technology organisation , Take Back the Tech , a global network of women who encourage people to " take back online spaces " by writing , video blogging , or podcasting about online harassment .
It wo n't mean the end of misogyny on the web , but it is a start .
Such campaigns show that women are ready to demand freedom from harassment and fear in our new public spaces .
In the same way that we should be able to walk down the street without fear of being raped , women should n't have to stay quiet online - or pretend to be men - to be free of threats and harassment .
It is time to take back the sites .
Kelly Beatty at Sky and Telescope reports that an asteroid about 100 30 meters across will pass the Earth on March 2 , missing us by a scant 60,000 kilometers !
That ’s a clean miss , but still pretty close .
The rock , called 2009 DD45 , was discovered only a few days ago — it ’s small and faint , making it easy to miss .
Closest approach is at 13:44 UT , and it happens over the Pacific .
Hopefully lots of amateur astronomers will get images of it ; it ’ll be bright enough for awhile to catch .
The problem is it ’ll be moving really fast across the sky … well , fast meaning half a degree per minute , which in turn means getting images of it will be very tough ; it ’ll streak through a telescope ’s field of view like a meteor at that rate .
You ’ll never see it naked eye ; at magnitude 10 at brightest it ’s a fraction as bright as what you can see with just your eye .
It ’s also too high up to be a danger to any satellites ( space is big , so even one getting much closer is really unlikely to smack into something ) .
Still , it ’s pretty cool .
And I ’ll add that while news like this scares some people , it actually makes me feel somewhat better : we ’re getting really good at finding these kinds of things .
Sure , if this rock had happened to be headed right for us we ’d only have a few days warning before it hit ( generating an enormous blast , as much as a high - yield nuclear weapon ) .
But the thing is we ’re looking for and finding such rocks .
That ’s the first step ; identifying potentially dangerous impactors .
We ’ve shown we can do it .
The next step is to do something about them .
Smart folks are working on it , and I bet in the next few years we ’ll have a realistic and deployable plan on what action to take if we do see one drawing a bead on us .
Since the odds of getting hit at any given time are low , statistically speaking we still have time to figure this all out .
But we do n’t have forever .
Let ’s let 2009 DD45 be a reminder of that .
We need to start doing something about these things , before we find one that really is scary .

Kelly deserves the credit ! ]
In a statement , Jeffrey Wiesner , Fairey 's lawyer , said : " Shepard Fairey was completely unaware that there were any warrants for his arrest .
Had he known , he would have resolved all such issues before the opening of his art exhibit at the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston . "
A drop of blood or a chunk of tissue smaller than the period at the end of this sentence may one day be all that is necessary to diagnose cancers and assess their response to treatment , say researchers at the Stanford University School of Medicine .
In a Nature Medicine study , the scientists used a specialized machine capable of analyzing whether individual cancer - associated proteins were present in the tiny samples and even whether modifications of the proteins varied in response to cancer treatments .
Although the study focuses on blood cancers , the hope is that the technique might also provide a faster , less invasive way to track solid tumors .
" Currently we do n't know what 's going on in a patient 's actual tumor cells when a treatment is given , " said oncologist Alice Fan , MD , a clinical instructor in the division of oncology at the medical school .
" The standard way we measure if a treatment is working is to wait several weeks to see if the tumor mass shrinks .
It would really be a leap forward if we could detect what is happening at a cellular level . "
Fan , the lead author of the study , performed the research in the laboratory of senior author Dean Felsher , MD , PhD , associate professor of medicine and of pathology and the leader of the Stanford Molecular Therapeutics Program .
" This technology allows us to analyze cancer - associated proteins on a very small scale , " said Felsher , a member of Stanford 's Cancer Center , who studies how cancer genes called oncogenes initiate and influence tumor progression in many types of cancers .
" Not only can we detect picogram levels — one - trillionth of a gram — of protein , but we can also see very subtle changes in the ways the protein is modified . "
Variations in the way a protein is modified , or phosphorylated , can affect how it functions in tumor progression .
Cancer cells often evade common therapies by rejiggering their levels of protein expression and degrees of phosphorylation .
Analyzing repeated small samples from a tumor undergoing treatment may allow doctors to head off rogue cells at the pass before they have a chance to proliferate into a more resistant tumor or to identify patients likely to fail standard approaches to treatment .
Fan and Felsher collaborated with researchers from Palo Alto - based Cell Biosciences , which makes the machine used in this study , to separate cancer - associated proteins in narrow capillary tubes based on their charge , which varies according to modifications on the proteins ' surface .
Two versions of the same protein — one phosphorylated and one not — can be easily distinguished because they travel different distances in the tube .
The researchers then used antibodies to identify the relative amounts and positions of the various proteins .
The scientists found that not only was the technique able to identify oncogene activation in cultured tumor cells , but it also worked well in small lymphoma samples drawn from laboratory mice with small , hollow needles .
Furthermore , they were able to detect varying levels of expression of two common oncogenes in 44 of 49 lymphoma samples from human patients as compared with normal controls , and even distinguish some types of lymphomas from others .
Finally , they were able to detect subtle differences in phosphorylation in several other cancer - associated proteins .
" Some of these proteins can exist as five or six phosphorylated variants , " said Felsher .
" With this technology we can see changes that occur in as little as 10 percent of the total protein pool .
Now we have a tool that will really help us look at what 's happening in cells over time . "
" Surgical biopsies usually require general anesthesia and large amounts of tissue , " agreed Fan .
" If we can figure out how to go in with a needle and remove just a few cells for analysis , we could repeatedly assess how the tumor is responding to treatment . "
For example , the researchers were able to confirm through serial biopsies of a human lymphoma patient that , as suggested by previous research in the Felsher lab , the lipid - lowering drug atorvastatin reduces phosphorylation of yet another cancer - associated protein .
" This is the first time we 've been able to see that this compound affects the biology of cancer cells in patients , " said Felsher .
Although Fan and Felsher focused on lymphoma and leukemia in this study , Fan is expanding her investigations to include head and neck tumors , which tend to be relatively accessible for cell sampling .
Both researchers caution that more research must be conducted before the technology is widely available clinically .

Movie stars naked on film : Mr. Skin
[ GlobalISel ]
Fix multiply with overflow intrinsics legalization generating invalid MIR .
During lowering of G_UMULO and friends , the previous code moved the builder 's insertion point to be after the legalizing instruction .
When that happened , if there happened to be a " G_CONSTANT i32 0 " immediately after , the CSEMIRBuilder would try to find that constant during the buildConstant ( zero ) call , and since it dominates itself would return the iterator unchanged , even though the def of the constant was * after * the current insertion point .
This resulted in the compare being generated * before * the constant which it was using .
There 's no need to modify the insertion point before building the mul - hi or constant .
Delaying moving the insert point ensures those are built / CSEd before the G_ICMP is built .

By Ben Cohen
An excellent piece by Phil Weiss on the difficulties journalists face when confronting the elephant in the room , Israel and its treatment of the Palestinians .
There 's no doubt that Israel / Palestine is not covered fairly in the U.S ( it still amazes me when Jews I know claim the U.S media is anti Israel ) , and the overwhelming majority of journalists assiduously avoid criticizing the Jewish state .
I still think the most powerful way to bring attention to the matter is for Jews to speak out against Israeli crimes as loud as they can .
That 's why I write openly about it , and will always put those ideals ahead of making money .
Sites like Mondoweiss are invaluable to the cause , and their struggle will no doubt pay dividends in the end .

Syllabus
NOTE : Where it is feasible , a syllabus ( headnote ) will be released , as is being done in connection with this case , at the time the opinion is issued .
The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader .
See United States v. Detroit Timber & Lumber Co. , 200 U. S. 321 .
SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
ARIZONA v. GANT
certiorari to the supreme court of arizona
Respondent Gant was arrested for driving on a suspended license , handcuffed , and locked in a patrol car before officers searched his car and found cocaine in a jacket pocket .
The Arizona trial court denied his motion to suppress the evidence , and he was convicted of drug offenses .
Reversing , the State Supreme Court distinguished New York v. Belton , 453 U. S. 454 — which held that police may search the passenger compartment of a vehicle and any containers therein as a contemporaneous incident of a recent occupant ’s lawful arrest — on the ground that it concerned the scope of a search incident to arrest but did not answer the question whether officers may conduct such a search once the scene has been secured .
Because Chimel v. California , 395 U. S. 752 , requires that a search incident to arrest be justified by either the interest in officer safety or the interest in preserving evidence and the circumstances of Gant ’s arrest implicated neither of those interests , the State Supreme Court found the search unreasonable .
Held : Police may search the passenger compartment of a vehicle incident to a recent occupant ’s arrest only if it is reasonable to believe that the arrestee might access the vehicle at the time of the search or that the vehicle contains evidence of the offense of arrest .
Pp. 5 –18 .
( a) Warrantless searches “ are per se unreasonable , ” “ subject only to a few specifically established and well - delineated exceptions . ”
Katz v. United States , 389 U. S. 347 .
The exception for a search incident to a lawful arrest applies only to “ the area from within which [ an arrestee ] might gain possession of a weapon or destructible evidence . ”
Chimel , 395 U. S. , at 763 .
This Court applied that exception to the automobile context in Belton , the holding of which rested in large part on the assumption that articles inside a vehicle ’s passenger compartment are “ generally … within ‘ the area into which an arrestee might reach . ’ ” 453 U. S. , at 460 .
Pp. 5 –8 .
( b) This Court rejects a broad reading of Belton that would permit a vehicle search incident to a recent occupant ’s arrest even if there were no possibility the arrestee could gain access to the vehicle at the time of the search .
The safety and evidentiary justifications underlying Chimel ’s exception authorize a vehicle search only when there is a reasonable possibility of such access .
Although it does not follow from Chimel , circumstances unique to the automobile context also justify a search incident to a lawful arrest when it is “ reasonable to believe evidence relevant to the crime of arrest might be found in the vehicle . ”
Thornton v. United States , 541 U. S. 615 ( Scalia , J. , concurring in judgment ) .
Neither Chimel ’s reaching - distancerule nor Thornton ’s allowance for evidentiary searches authorized the search in this case .
In contrast to Belton , which involved a single officer confronted with four unsecured arrestees , five officers handcuffed and secured Gant and the two other suspects in separate patrol cars before the search began .
Gant clearly could not have accessed his car at the time of the search .
An evidentiary basis for the search was also lacking .
Belton and Thornton were both arrested for drug offenses , but Gant was arrested for driving with a suspended license — an offense for which police could not reasonably expect to find evidence in Gant ’s car .
Cf. Knowles v. Iowa , 525 U. S. 113 .
The search in this case was therefore unreasonable .
Pp. 8 –11 .
( c) This Court is unpersuaded by the State ’s argument that its expansive reading of Belton correctly balances law enforcement interests with an arrestee ’s limited privacy interest in his vehicle .
The State seriously undervalues the privacy interests at stake , and it exaggerates both the clarity provided by a broad reading of Belton and its importance to law enforcement interests .
A narrow reading of Belton and Thornton , together with this Court ’s other Fourth Amendment decisions , e.g. , Michigan v. Long , 463 U. S. 103 , and United States v. Ross , 456 U. S. 798 , permit an officer to search a vehicle when safety or evidentiary concerns demand .
Pp. 11 –14 .
(d) Stare decisis does not require adherence to a broad reading of Belton .
The experience of the 28 years since Belton has shown that the generalization underpinning the broad reading of that decision is unfounded , and blind adherence to its faulty assumption would authorize myriad unconstitutional searches .
Pp. 15 –18 .
216 Ariz. 1 , 162 P. 3d 640 , affirmed .
Stevens , J. , delivered the opinion of the Court , in which Scalia , Souter , Thomas , and Ginsburg , JJ. , joined .
Scalia , J. , filed a concurring opinion .
Breyer , J. , filed a dissenting opinion .
Alito , J. , filed a dissenting opinion , in which Roberts , C. J. , and Kennedy , J. , joined , and in which Breyer , J. , joined except as to Part II–E .

OUR galaxy may be embedded in a pancake of dark matter , so dense it is easier to detect than conventional dark matter .
Most astronomers believe a spherical cloud of dark matter envelops our galaxy .
Though invisible , its gravity perturbs the visible stuff .
Now there may also be a pancake of dark matter .
Calculations by Tobias Bruch of the University of Zurich , Switzerland , and colleagues suggest that when the Milky Way devours smaller galaxies , their dark matter should get caught in its disc of stars and gas .
This would form a pancake that Earth - based experiments would find easier to spot because …

The Hawkeye State gets it
April 27 , 2009 by lestro
by lestro
There was a great article in Sunday ’s New York Times about Iowa and the reaction of the citizenry to the Iowa Supreme Court ’s allowance of gay marriage .
I ’ll be honest with you , it was not what I expected , but it really sounds like Iowans get it ; they understand the whole idea of America .
I am not sure of the history of Iowa and have only been through there once ( I spent a great night in the Quad Cities where I attended a BYOB strip club where I was actually told by the stripper to “ grab some titty , boy ” ) , but there seems to be a real libertarian streak that runs through the countryside .
Take this woman , for example , from the town portrayed in the painting “ American Gothic . ”
“ To be honest , I would rather not have it in Iowa , ” said Shirley Cox , who has spent most of her 84 years in this old railroad town .
Ms. Cox said she had always been proud to tell people what state she was from , but now was not so sure .
“ But the thing is , ” she went on , “ it ’s really none of my business .
Who am I to tell someone how to live ?
I live the way I want , and they should live the way they want .
I ’m surely not going to stomp and raise heck and campaign against it . ”
Because I think the visual only adds to it , this is Shirley :
is n’t she great ?
What a truly American view on life : it ’s not right for me , but what business is it of mine ?
According to the article , Iowa ’s history is one filled with amazing accomplishments one would n’t necessarily associate with a Midwestern Farm Belt state :
In 1839 , the Supreme Court for what was then the territory of Iowa refused to recognize a slave as a possession , years before the United States Supreme Court would rule in an opposite fashion , against Dred Scott .
In 1868 and 1873 , the court issued rulings favoring desegregating schools and public accommodations , almost a century before the United States Supreme Court heard Brown v. Board of Education .
Iowa was the first state , in 1869 , to permit women to practice law .
At the very core of it , is n’t Ms. Cox ’s statement really what it means to be an American ?
Your rights end where mine begin .
And as long as no one forces me to marry anybody – or tells me i can’t marry someone , for that matter – I do n’t care who you marry .
Like Ms. Cox , my new hero , you do n’t have to like it .
But it really is none of your business ( as yours is none of mine ) and you have no right to tell anyone how to live .
Kudos to the Iowa Supreme Court for striking down an unfair law and kudos to Iowans for their incredible pragmatic attitude toward the whole thing .
You are good Americans , Iowa , and yes , Ms. Cox , you should be very proud to tell people where you come from .
The Des Moines Register today has a story about the first gay marriage in Iowa and it highlights , without a doubt , the reasons this cannot and should not be stopped : there are rights and privileges granted to married couples that are being kept from others and THAT IS UNAMERICAN .
Shelley Wolfe , 38 , and Melisa Keeton , 31 , were the first gay couple in Polk County to marry under the new ruling .
They applied for their marriage license this morning then immediately got a judge to waive the standard three - day waiting period .
They wanted to get married quickly , because Keeton is 25 weeks pregnant .
They ’ve been together nearly three years .
“ For us , while I ’m only 25 weeks pregnant , already into the third trimester , I ’ve had a lot of medical issues , ” said Keeton , who was waiting in line to have their marriage license notarized .
“ To me it ’ll be a lot less stressful because we ’ll have legal rights .
Really , today is about making it legal . ”
They have one son , Baxter , who ’ll turn 3 in June .
The women had a religious ceremony in 2007 , but it lacked legal standing .
There are two important points .
The first is the big one , about the pregnant one ’s health and the medical issues she has had .
Without this ruling , should something go wrong during the delivery – or any other time – her partner , now wife , would not have had the access rights granted to any straight couple who were married .
The second issue is the last sentence , which highlights very clearly the difference between a legal marriage and a religious marriage : religious marriages do n’t mean shit .
It really is that simple .
So next time anyone tells you that marriage is a religious institution , remind them that no matter how many priests , clerics , reverends , rabbis , imams , witch doctors or high priestesses they have tell them they are married , it does n’t count until they sign a legal contract .
And no one wants to force any stupid right - wing religious hatemongers to allow gays to marry in their church – hey , it ’s America , if you want to hate , you go right ahead and hate .
( By the way , does n’t the Bible say “ judge not lest ye be judged ” ?
so why do n’t you worry about the whole “ free will ” thing god gave humans and leave the judging to her , hmmm ? )
But just like Shirley Cox , you do n’t get to tell anyone else how to live their lives …
Mozilla has renamed the oft - delayed Firefox 3.1 to Firefox 3.5 and said a fourth beta of the browser is slated for a 14 April release .
A possible name change has been batted around inside Mozilla Towers for several weeks , but the outfit finally confirmed the decision yesterday .
“ As recently proposed , the version number of the Shiretoko project will be changed to Firefox 3.5 before the upcoming fourth beta release , ” said Firefox director Mike Beltzner on the corporation 's developer blog .
The number of new features that have been packed into the upcoming version of Internet Explorer ’s closest rival meant it was necessary to reflect those changes in the name , said Mozilla ’s engineering veep Mike Shaver last week .
" The increase in scope represented by TraceMonkey and Private Browsing , plus the sheer volume of work that 's gone into everything from video and layout to places and the plugin service make it a larger increment than we believe is reasonable to label 3.1 , " he said .
Mozilla posted a proposed timeline for its developers to move various systems from Firefox 3.1 to Firefox 3.5 on the corporation ’s wiki yesterday .
It details the planned changes to the release , which has already been hit by several delays due to show - stopping bugs .
In January Mozilla was unable to confirm when it would release the third beta of Firefox 3.1 after 15 nasty bugs were discovered in TraceMonkey , which is the firm ’s new JavaScript Engine .
Beta 3 is expected to land this Thursday and will be the final Firefox release to carry the 3.1 tag .
“ It ’s important to note that 3.5 represents a better labeling of our current scope , and not an indication that we intend to significantly increase this release ’s scope any further , ” said Shaver .
But the version switcheroo could ruffle feathers among the wider developer community , where some have grumbled about the number of delays the corporation has already hit with its upcoming browser release .
Last summer it was a slightly different story when Mozilla 's platform evangelist Mark Finkle insisted on his blog that the transition to Firefox 3.1 would n’t be “ a major pain - in - the - ass ” , and pledged developers would n't be hit by “ surprises along the way ” . ®
Richard Wrangham , a primatologist and anthropologist , has spent four decades observing wild chimpanzees in Africa to see what their behavior might tell us about prehistoric humans .
Dr. Wrangham , 60 , was born in Britain and since 1989 has been at Harvard , where he is a professor of biological anthropology .
His book , “ Catching Fire : How Cooking Made Us Human , ” will be published in late May .
He was interviewed over a vegetarian lunch at last winter ’s American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting in Chicago and again later by telephone .
An edited version of the two conversations follows .
Q . In your new book , you suggest that cooking was what facilitated our evolution from ape to human .
Until now scientists have theorized that tool making and meat eating set the conditions for the ascent of man .
Why do you argue that cooking was the main factor ?
A . All that you mention were drivers of the evolution of our species .
However , our large brain and the shape of our bodies are the product of a rich diet that was only available to us after we began cooking our foods .
It was cooking that provided our bodies with more energy than we ’d previously obtained as foraging animals eating raw food .
I have followed wild chimpanzees and studied what , and how , they eat .
Modern chimps are likely to take the same kinds of foods as our early ancestors .
In the wild , they ’ll be lucky to find a fruit as delicious as a raspberry .
More often they locate a patch of fruits as dry and strong - tasting as rose hips , which they ’ll masticate for a full hour .
Chimps spend most of their day finding and chewing extremely fibrous foods .
Their diet is very unsatisfying to humans .
But once our ancestors began eating cooked foods  approximately 1.8 million years ago  their diet became softer , safer and far more nutritious .
Agreement Reached on Rasmussen Obama Saves NATO Governments from Summit Shame
A call made by Barack Obama helped end the impasse .
The Turkish government has given up its opposition and Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen will now become the new head of NATO .
By doing so , Obama saved Angela Merkel and Nicolas Sarkozy from deep embarrassment at the summit .

The Colour Purple …
Disclaimer :
Please get comfy … and you might want to get a cup of coffee / can of Redbull / gram of speed to keep you going through this one …
When my brother and the sugar - coated Sherman tank that ended up becoming his ( now ex ) wife were star crossed young lovers , they were desperate to shack up together and plunge nose - first into credit - related chaos .
Unfortunately , they were hindered in their plight by that annoying , age old stumbling block of having no job , no money … and criminal records .
Their doomed blossoming romance needed help … and someone answered their call …
Behold !
Bumbling along , like a drunken , late - teens , slightly sex - obsessed superhero , whose special powers consisted only of regular employment , being debt - free and having no previous convictions against his name … step forward ' Super Pooflake ' – aka : ‘ Security Bond & Deposit Guarantee Boy ’ !
I signed up and lived there for about a year or so , genuinely enjoying my first taste of freedom without the parents ... although to be fair , my folks were always pretty liberal on the ‘ bringing girls home ’ front ( Dad used to ‘ high five ’ me as I escorted the young ladies out of the house ' post - humpage ' ) .
My steady girlfriend of the time pretty much moved in with me , work was nearby – all was good .
Unfortunately , although we made a fair fist of blissful cohabitation for a while , living under the same roof as my brother and his monu- mentalist missus simply could n’t last .
( Their domestic disputes made the hundred years war look like a ‘ bit of a tiff ’ … I soon developed a sort of Jedi-esque ‘ I have a bad feeling about this ’ ability at spotting violent arguments just before they kicked off … and spider senses to avoid ashtrays just before they whizzed past my head )
Eventually , I informed them of my decision to move out , and all was amicably agreed .
They had been on the premises for over a year , were getting by and were settled in ; however , they asked me to hang around for a bit whilst they found a replacement lodger to help them with the almost overlooked matter of paying .
the. fucking .rent .
I do n’t know how , or where from , but eventually , they found their saviour in the spindly form of ‘ Nigel ’ .
Nigel was an accountant - type fellow and owned a home PC , and this was in the days where your average compooter - a- tron was the size of an articulated lorry , had twirly - round tape wheel thingies , and thousands of nondescript lights blinking on and off like the set of Blake ’s 7 .
I was impressed .
However , my suspicions were first aroused as to him possibly having ‘ rolled onto the mouldy side of the fruit bowl ’ when I was helping him move in , and I complimented him on some of the artwork that adorned his new bedroom walls .
Although the subject matter was n’t exactly my ‘ cup - of - tea ’ ( general wildlife , gore fests , people hanging from trees etc ) , I could at least acknowledge the talent involved .
“ They ’re good ” I bleated nervously before enquiring : “ Did you paint them yourself ? ”
He then informed me that he had bought the paintings from various artists , but that every piece had one thing in common .
Each artist featured in his collection had later committed suicide … this was his motivation for buying them .
' Ooooooookay then ' thinks I , as I slowly back out of the room ...
Nigel got past the first few days without incident , and like so many stories on this QotW will no doubt testify , he seemed to be one of those guys who pretty much ‘ kept himself to himself ’ .
To celebrate his arrival ( and my subsequent freedom ) , we decided to venture out for a good old ‘ boozy do ’ .
Nigel was invited but said he had ‘ other plans ’ .
Non perturbed , my brother , his g/f and I went to our local and partook in the time - honoured tradition of getting bladder - bustingly shitfaced .
When kicking out time came , we were predictably kicked out , and we staggered back to the house for a ' sophisticated night cap ' ( tins of cider ) , and the welcome invitation for me to sleep on the sofa .
We crept along as we approached the house , in a conscientious move to avoid causing a disturbance .
My brother ’s g/f then quietly opened the front door , and as we tip - toed along the hallway we noticed that the lounge light was still on .
‘ Ah , Nigel must still be up ’ , we thought to ourselves as we opened the door …
The sight that awaited us shook me to the very core .
Nigel was laying flat out on the floor , plum faced , completely stark - bollock naked , except for his trollies which were pulled down by his ankles , and a thick leather belt wrapped tightly round his throat .
In one of his hands was a half drunk bottle of scotch …on his other hand was a purple silk glove , and in it he was holding his limp , dribbling , flaccid bacon bazooka , which was drooping snoozily , with a drizzle of post - ejaculatum oozing from his blistered hog ’s eye .
Surrounding him was a collection of jizzed - to - a - pulp tissues , scattered liberally about like stumpy , scrunched up little monuments to all things spunkilicious .
Nigel had passed out completely … fixed with the kind of glazed , gurning expression that you find on mongs clutching tickets to a Chuckle Brothers extravaganza .
He had quite literally wanked himself into blurry unconsciousness .
Aghast at this initial sight , our eyes were then turned to the subject playing on the video …
Despite the shaky camerawork , we could clearly make out an uncomfortable - looking woman repeatedly thrusting herself back and forth on to the gargantuan dangling phallus of a strapping farm horse – and both parties were ‘ whinnying ’ frantically as the dong - tastic Dobbin was plunged balls deep into her cavernous cack - canyon time and time again .
As we collectively recoiled we were just in time to watch another young lady collect about half a gallon of fresh horse spaff into a carrier bag … then tip it all over herself .
Time then seemed to slow down for us , Matrix style , as we stood there looking at the screen , then each other , then Nigel , then the screen again ... as we noticed the action had changed to feature a rather blessed - in - the - chest - department female receiving enthusiastic oral pleasure from a weapons grade Rottweiller … whilst another was frying the dog ’s miniature mountain of munting manure … and eating it .
( she was using a knife and fork though ... it seems there ’s always time for good table manners ) .
“ Whooooa ? ” I mewed meekly , leaving my mouth agape as my fledgling mind warped more and more beyond recognition with every passing frame of filthy film footage .
…
Eventually , my brother timidly ponders : “ Ahh … … erm … … Shhhh , do n’t wake him ” he whispers kindly , holding his finger to his lips .
In the meantime , his psychopathic significant other had stepped over Nigel , and quietly switched off the TV … But as she heard my brother 's words she breathed deeply , then visibly ‘ snapped ’ – screaming out at a lung - collapsing volume :
” DON’T FUCKING WAKE HIM ? ”
Bellowing with a force that would have had Brian Blessed reaching for the ear plugs , she continued : ” Oi ! * kicks Nigel stoutly in the ribs * – you dirty , filthy fucker !
What the fucking FUCK do you think you ’re doing ? ”
Nigel slowly awoke and he rubbed his eyes , then after a brief realisation of his surroundings and the situation , he let out a piercing screech , like tyres in a 70’s car chase , before catapulting himself skywards in the manner of someone who had just received 3000 volts through his wrinkled , spent scrote ( which on reflection he probably would have enjoyed ) .
He then desperately scrambled about for his clouts , whilst attempting in vain to cover as many offending articles as he could ; yet only succeeding in doing what looked like a combination of synchronised swimming , an epileptic episode , and an impressive rendition of the ‘ funky chicken ’ dance .
Gazing down at this pathetic personification of purest perversion I tried to stifle the onset of giggles by adopting the moral high ground , ‘ tutting ’ loudly , shaking my head slowly , then turning and walking away in mock disgust … before running out of earshot and laughing like a particularly ticklish drain .
I slept in the bath .
To his credit , Nigel did n’t move out straight away …
Fair play to him , he tried to ‘ live it down ’ , but there are just some things that no amount of apologising can make up for , some things that you ca n’t just ' sweep under the carpet ' ( especially when you know what has taken place on that carpet )
Most of all …it ’s impossible to share a house with someone when you ca n’t even bring yourselves to look each other in the eye .
He lasted about a fortnight .

Nigel got past the first few days without incident , and like so many stories on this QotW will no doubt testify , he seemed to be one of those guys who pretty much ‘ kept himself to himself ’ .
To celebrate his arrival ( and my subsequent freedom ) , we decided to venture out for a good old ‘ boozy do ’ .
Nigel was invited but said he had ‘ other plans ’ .
Non perturbed , my brother , his g/f and I went to our local and partook in the time - honoured tradition of getting bladder - bustingly shitfaced .
When kicking out time came , we were predictably kicked out , and we staggered back to the house for a ' sophisticated night cap ' ( tins of cider ) , and the welcome invitation for me to sleep on the sofa .
We crept along as we approached the house , in a conscientious move to avoid causing a disturbance .
My brother ’s g/f then quietly opened the front door , and as we tip - toed along the hallway we noticed that the lounge light was still on .
‘ Ah , Nigel must still be up ’ , we thought to ourselves as we opened the door …
The sight that awaited us shook me to the very core .
Nigel was laying flat out on the floor , plum faced , completely stark - bollock naked , except for his trollies which were pulled down by his ankles , and a .
In one of his hands was a half drunk bottle of scotch …on his other hand was a , and in it he was holding his limp , dribbling , flaccid bacon bazooka , which was drooping snoozily , with a drizzle of post - ejaculatum oozing from his blistered hog ’s eye .
Surrounding him was a collection of jizzed - to - a - pulp tissues , scattered liberally about like stumpy , scrunched up little monuments to all things spunkilicious .
Nigel had passed out completely … fixed with the kind of glazed , gurning expression that you find on mongs clutching tickets to a Chuckle Brothers extravaganza .
He had quite literally wanked himself into blurry unconsciousness .
Aghast at this initial sight , our eyes were then turned to the subject playing on the video … Despite the shaky camerawork , we could clearly make out an uncomfortable - looking woman repeatedly thrusting herself back and forth on to the gargantuan dangling phallus of a strapping farm horse – and both parties were ‘ whinnying ’ frantically as the dong - tastic Dobbin was plunged balls deep into her cavernous cack - canyon time and time again .
As we collectively recoiled we were just in time to watch another young lady collect about half a gallon of fresh horse spaff into a carrier bag … then tip it all over herself .
Time then seemed to slow down for us , Matrix style , as we stood there looking at the screen , then each other , then Nigel , then the screen again ... as we noticed the action had changed to feature a rather blessed - in - the - chest - department female receiving enthusiastic oral pleasure from a weapons grade Rottweiller … whilst another was frying the dog ’s miniature mountain of munting manure … and eating it .
( sheusing a knife and fork though ... it seems there ’stime for good table manners ) . ”
I mewed meekly , leaving my mouth agape as my fledgling mind warped more and more beyond recognition with every passing frame of filthy film footage .
Eventually , my brother timidly ponders : “ Ahh … …… … Shhhh , do n’t wake him ” he whispers kindly , holding his finger to his lips .
In the meantime , his psychopathic significant other had stepped over Nigel , and quietly switched off the TV … But as she heard my brother 's words she breathed deeply , then visibly ‘ snapped ’ – screaming out at a lung - collapsing volume : ” DON’T FUCKING WAKE HIM ?
” Bellowing with a force that would have had Brian Blessed reaching for the ear plugs , she continued : ” Oi ! * kicks Nigel stoutly in the ribs * – you dirty , filthy fucker !
What the fucking FUCK do you think you ’re doing ?
” Nigel slowly awoke and he rubbed his eyes , then after a brief realisation of his surroundings and the situation , he let out a piercing screech , like tyres in a 70’s car chase , before catapulting himself skywards in the manner of someone who had just received 3000 volts through his wrinkled , spent scrote ( which on reflection he probably would have enjoyed ) .
He then desperately scrambled about for his clouts , whilst attempting in vain to cover as many offending articles as he could ; yet only succeeding in doing what looked like a combination of synchronised swimming , an epileptic episode , and an impressive rendition of the ‘ funky chicken ’ dance .
Gazing down at this pathetic personification of purest perversion I tried to stifle the onset of giggles by adopting the moral high ground , ‘ tutting ’ loudly , shaking my head slowly , then turning and walking away in mock disgust … before running out of earshot and laughing like a particularly ticklish drain .
I slept in the bath .
To his credit , Nigel did n’t move out straight away …
Fair play to him , he tried to ‘ live it down ’ , but there are just some things that no amount of apologising can make up for , some things that you ca n’t just ' sweep under the carpet ' ( especially when you know what has taken place on that carpet ) Most of all …it ’s impossible to share a house with someone when you ca n’t even bring yourselves to look each other in the eye .
He lasted about a fortnight . ( , Fri 27 Feb 2009 , 11:58 , 23 replies
Leave Mrs. B alone !
One of the places I used to live in Southampton was a bikers chapterhouse ( basically a house that was the headquarters for a biker gang ) .
When people think of biker gangs they think of drug taking , kneecapping , granny beating antichrists .
Some are , lots are not .
I moved in about 2 months after the house was taken over .
There were lots of big , smelly , scary bikers living there .
The area was a huge blue rinse zone and it did n't take too long for them to realise that we were n't what we appeared .
Before long I 'd be wandering down the road in cut offs , long hair , three days growth and generally looking quite scary .
More often than not I 'd have a little old lady coming up to me at the pedestrian crossing and asking me to help them cross the road ( deary ) .
In the back garden we had about 15 - 20 apple trees .
They were all cookers and there was a little old lady next door that came round to ask , as we were n't using them , if she could use them to make pies .
We had no problem with this what so ever , infact we 'd pick them when they became ripe and take them round to her and she 'd bring us vast quantities of homemade apple pies
. Everyone loved Mrs. B .
One day about twenty of us are lounging around smoking herbal cigarettes and there 's a shout from the driveway .
A biker runs in and shouts , ' They 're mugging Mrs. B . '
We all run out .
Fuck with Mrs. B and you fuck with us !
We get into the road and there 's two guys ( obviously pissed off as Chavs have n't been invented and yet to find a way of defining themselves ) .
I still to this day feel sorry for them .
Textbook granny mugging and they hear from behind , ' OI !
LEAVE MRS .
B ALONE !!!'
They had the living shite kicked out of them , even Mrs. B put a dainty boot in .
The police did turn up and talk to Mrs. B and said , ' So they fell over then . '
We never had any problems with the police after that and they pretty much relied on us to keep an eye on the granny fraternity afterwards .

Might be a repost but
My housemate Sabine was very nice , but a bit scatty .
She went to a party and had a few drinks and they shared a curry .
At the end she said " thanks for a lovely evening but I should be going " , tucked her bag under her arm and headed off .
A couple of minutes later she came back , looking a bit pink .
" I 'm dreadfully sorry " she said .
" I thought I 'd tucked my handbag under my arm , but it was a naan bread " .

The saddest young man in the world
I was lodging with a very well to - do family in their large , modern home .
The parents were very friendly types , the kind who ’d watch Midsomer Murders on a Saturday night , but blush as soon as anything remotely adult appeared on screen .
They had a complete failure of a son , who was older than myself , but worked in Sainsbury ’s and rarely left his room , and a daughter , Gemma , who was my age , and whose room was directly opposite mine .
Gemma was n’t hot , but she was certainly attractive , she had a curvy figure and a pretty great body , but was let down by her Jimmy Hill - ean chin ;
She had the kind of arse that forced involuntary spasms in the trousers of young men .
Unfortunately , she also had a boyfriend .
A ridiculously good - looking , manly , boyfriend , and their relationship was pretty solid , but of course , that would n’t stop me fwapping over her occasionally .
One night I was having trouble sleeping , and after a few minutes of tossing and turning , I became aware of a quiet , squeaking sound coming from across the hall .
It took me a second to realise what it must be ; Gemma and Captain Fantastic going at it , their bedsprings squeaking to the rhythm of their energetic thrusting .
The thought started to get me going , I was becoming turned on , and my imagination ran wild with images of their sweaty embrace .
My hands reached down , and I began tugging at my meaty shaft .
My head filled with fantasies of Gemma being taken roughly from behind , quietly whimpering as her boyfriend ’s rigid cock bounced merrily off her G spot , then he flips her over , wraps her ankles around her shoulders , slides deep inside her , and they kiss gently as he grinds his hips against hers .
I vividly imagined her smell , her taste , the way she would feel , in my mind I had taken the place of her boyfriend .
I was making her feel things she had never felt before , taken her and pleasured her like never before , and then she came , writhing and arching her body beneath me .
I was spent , the fantasy had done its job , and I tried to get to sleep .
However , the squeaking bedsprings went on for a long time after I ’d finished , it felt like at least an hour before Gemma ’s large , brute of a man had spilled his load .
The next morning I awoke early , and as I pottered around my bedroom I became aware of the bedspring sound again .
Surely they were n’t at it again ?
I have to admit , I was impressed by their stamina , and decided to knock out another quick one before I left for work .
I straightened myself up , got ready , and stepped out into the hall .
The bastard squeaking was still going , but looking at the floor , I realised where it had been coming from the whole time .
Gemma had left her Hamster cage by her bedroom door , the sound of little Hammy running in his wheel had been keeping her awake at night .
Fucksocks .
I ’d only been wanking over a cunting Hamster .

The Mysterious World of Kit-Kat
Back when I was at Uni , a Chinese exchange student named Kit-Kat ( seriously ) , moved into the house for the last semester .
We never saw him .
Ever .
Strangest thing was , he did n't seem to use the bathroom .
Ever .
He 'd come back from his lectures and shoot up to his room , firmly locking the door behind him .
Winter and spring rolls by and one day we wake up from a heavy session at the pub the night before to discover Kit - Kat has fucked off .
He moved out without even letting us know .
It was only because the door to his room was open that we knew he'd gone , we 'd never seen the door open .
Not in all the time he was living with us .
Being nosy bastards , my housemates and I ventured into the unknown world of Kit - Kat 's room .
The first thing that hit you was the smell .
It was like rancid , decaying flesh and shit .
And the carpet crunched underfoot .
How the fuck do you make a carpet crunchy , for fucks sake ?
" This is fucked up , " said my mate Blackpool Ben .
I opened the wardrobe .
" Fuck ME ! ! ! "
It was stacked floor to ceiling with two litre coke bottles .
Full of piss .
There must 've been enough piss to fill a swimming pool in that wardrobe .
And there were flies , swarming over the bottles , desperate - so it seemed - to find a way inside .
At about the same time my other housemate Betty ( a bloke , but we called him Betty for some unknown reason ) said : " Spanky , you are not gonna fucking believe this ... "
Betty was standing over the dresser , he 'd opened the first drawer .
More flies .
Bigger , angrier , faster , buzzier ...
I sort of knew what he'd found already , you could tell by the sudden even stronger stentch that assailed the room .
" Shit , " said Betty .
" Bags of shit . "
He opened the next drawer down .
More shit .
There was a change in the bottom drawer though , this one only had used shit roll , compressed into a drawer - sized brick .
Streaky and matted with hair .
And more fucking flies .
And tiny pure white maggots .
Lots of um , weaving about and having a fucking rave .
Blackpool Ben opened the curtains .
Light flooded in and we flipped .
Now we could see why the carpet was crunchy .
It was covered , and I mean COVERED , in a thin film of crusty snot and / or semen in huge fucking random patches .
The green carpet resembled a field after the first fall of winter snow , only with snot and cum instead .
The three of us ran like fuck , slamming the door closed behind us .
" Bang goes his deposit , " I said , and the others tended to agree .

Early one morning , doing my rounds ...
... I took a shot of cocaine and I shot my woman down ...
Wait ... I fucked that up ... let me start again .
In the wee small hours of one student morning , doing a couple of lines of something I should n't have been with a friend and playing on the NES ( God , I am SO old ) .
We hear the front door open , We hear footsteps on the stairs .
We hear giggling , We hear moaning , We hear the unmistakable sounds of my Irish Cassanova flatmate getting down to the physical act of love .
I look at my co-conspirator , we shrug , and go back to our slightly aggressive game of Sensible Soccer , turning the volume up slightly , waiting for the inevitable signal that he had ' completed the task '
Why ' inevitable ? '
Well , we had a game , it was a very childish game admittedly , but it was our game nevertheless .
If any of us pulled ( and when I say any of us , I was n't the most successful sexual adventurer as a student , so it was mainly the other guys ) , at the moment of climax , we'd have to shout an advertising slogan as loud as we could .
You 'd get a point for each housemate that heard it ...
What would it be this time ?
we 'd already recently had what I considered the unbeatable ' The Lion Goes From Strength To Strength ! ' yelled at about 9 am on a Sunday morning .
We played another game of Sensible
And then we heard it , in a loud Irish Accent ...
...' Do n't Forget The Honey , Mummy !'
And we cracked .
Cracked in the way that only two immature Charlie 'd up wanker students could .
We were in hysterics , tears , crying , wheezing , giggling like buffoons .
We could n't stop .
I swear , it must have been 15 minutes later when , us still laughing , the door opened and in walked this girl we had never seen before .
She just said , ' I was just on my way home , but I had to come and see what was so funny '
So we explained , she did n't seem too put out , and , in fact , possibly even relieved that she had an explanation for the odd orgasm exclamation .
She was really sweet actually , and she stayed , talking to us , in a lovely , lilting Irish brogue for a good half hour .
I was beginning to think we could actually be friends .
Until the door burst open .
Irish Cassanova walked boldy in , wrapped in just a towel and proudly stated
' Oi , lads , oi've just fucked Terry Wogan 's daughter ...oh... I thought you 'd left ...'
She did .
Immediately .
For good .
Shame .
It could have been my turn next .

The dinner party …
A posh friend of the family has just retired , and has decided to keep herself busy by learning the arts of the gourmet .
Last Saturday , my ( whole ) family and I were amongst several guests cordially invited to a right proper la-de - fucking - da bash , with the finest expensive cuisine available
( This was , to be honest , totally wasted on my common - as - muck taste - buds , which have long since been obliterated by the savage combination of cheap cider and diet of ‘ Tesco - value - blue - stripe - super - saver - do n ’t - even - know - what - it - is - because - the - label - has - fell - off - the - tin - but - fuck - it - anyway - it - was - reduced - so - it - will - do ’ fodder . )
Note to self - no more fuck - off sized multi-hyphenated phrases
I apologise .
Moving on …
So , toffed - up - to - the - nines , we turn up .
The present Mrs Pooflake looks stunningly resplendant in her sophisticated black dress , the flakelets adorable in their little suits .
The finest china and silverware is out , and everybody is on their supremely best behaviour .
( I was on top form … I think I only said ‘ cunt - flap ’ once , accidentally , and I believe it went unnoticed – result ! )
The meal is excellent and goes well , I spend the whole time showing off , lying through my teeth pretending to be a veritable raconteur of the finer things in life , whilst my miniature Aryan race children are a credit to TPMP and I , sensible and well spoken , they display manners and knowledge beyond their years .
The party soon moves from the dining room to the bit where the kids go off to play , the ladies use an excuse to scuttle off to the kitchen so they can gossip and slag off the men , and the gentlemen have moved on for port , cigars and other such pretentious bullshit whilst we discuss ‘ manly ’ subject like brake - horsepower , world affairs , and the miracle that was Cov City ’s latest victory .
After a while , the women join us and as we are all congregated in the conservatory before leaving .
I casually mention the fabled tradition in my family of my boys being allowed to stay up late with me on a Saturday to watch ‘ Match Of The Day ’ .
Just then , the kids enter the room .
As they approach , they are accosted by one of the old trouts who grabs my 5 year old son , rattles his cheek and cackles :
“ So then , sonny , I ’ve heard about you …tell me , what do your family do every Saturday ? ”
My son grins hugely and replies instantly : “ We get a massive chinky in ! ”
“ Mmmf ” I say , spitting a gob - full of posh plonk across the room before trying to correct him in the vain hope of resurrecting some degree of poshness . “
Erm ….. ha haha… .
Noooo …. after that … ”
“ Ooooh yeah ” my son says , realising his mistake before continuing : “ We watch ‘ Match Of The Day . ’
It ’s brilliant ! ” he bleats with a big smile and a cute ‘ thumbs up ’ , prompting everyone to laugh , and me to sigh deeply , having rescued the conversation .
But then , just when I thought I had gotten away with it , my youngest continues to blurt out : “ Then ... after that …. we have to go to bed … ( here he frowns and grumbles ) ... because it ’s Mummy & Daddy ’s ‘ BIG SEXY TIME ’! ” *
…
At this point , my long - suffering missus tries to melt the walls with the glowing shame - heat from her face , as my sons launch into sounds effects like : ‘ Mwwaah ! , Mmmmmwaahh !
Uh Uh Uh Uh Uhhhhh ! ”
I tell you , from the look on some of those witches ’ faces , you ’d think they ’d never had a nice stiff cock inside ‘em at one time or another .
What …?
Tenuous ?... kids are housemates too are n’t they ?
* The thing is … I do n’t even know where he got the idea from … Every Saturday ?
I fucking WISH !

I casually mention the fabled tradition in my family of my boys being allowed to stay up late with me on a Saturday to watch ‘ Match Of The Day ’ .
Just then , the kids enter the room .
As they approach , they are accosted by one of the old trouts who grabs my 5 year old son , rattles his cheek and cackles :
“ So then , sonny , I ’ve heard about you …tell me , what do your family doSaturday ?
” My son grins hugely and replies instantly : “ We get a massive chinky in ! ” “ Mmmf ” I say , spitting a gob - full of posh plonk across the room before trying to correct him in the vain hope of resurrecting some degree of poshness . “ that … ” “ Ooooh yeah ” my son says , realising his mistake before continuing : “ We watch ‘ Match Of The Day . ’
It ’s brilliant ! ” he bleats with a big smile and a cute ‘ thumbs up ’ , prompting everyone to laugh , and me to sigh deeply , having rescued the conversation .
But then , just when I thought I had gotten away with it , my youngest continues to blurt out : “ Then ... after that …. we have to go to bed … ( here he frowns and grumbles ) ... because it ’s Mummy & Daddy ’s ‘ BIG SEXY TIME ’!” * At this point , my long - suffering missus tries to melt the walls with the glowing shame - heat from her face , as my sons launch into sounds effects like : ‘ Mwwaah ! , Mmmmmwaahh !
Uh Uh Uh Uh Uhhhhh !
” I tell you , from the look on some of those witches ’ faces , you ’d think they ’d never had a nice stiff cock inside ‘em at one time or another .
What …?

Turn it up to ELEVEN !!!
There comes a time when strapping two tea trays to your feet with duct tape and skiing down stairs wears thin .
There comes a day when all the powder fire extinguishers have been drained and the episodes of making your mates look like Casper the friendly ghost ( only a drunk , pissed off choking variant ) are but memories .
Yep .
I 'm talking third year at university .
It was a sunny Sunday morning in our large shared house .
A great big detached place next to a graveyard .
I was sprawling in the living room with the five other lads I shared with , watching Countryfile and drinking Skol - the usual Sunday morning routine .
We were all too skint to do anything constructive , and doing some study was about as alien a concept to us as Leonardo da Vinci singing in a death metal band .
After an hour of bliss involving tractors , sheep , and border collies , the tv was turned off and somebody put some nice mellow easy listening on .
Metallica , The Black Album .
It did n't take long for an idea to form in my booze - addled brain .
" Hey , we 've all got this cd , right ? "
A few grunts and shrugs , which counted as a ringing endorsement from this lot .
" Well , why do n't we all play it simultaneously ?
Lets see how loud we can make it ! "
A few more grunts and shrugs , " Its a plan " said my mate Betty ( named after the Betty Ford clinic ) , as he downed his latest can of Scandinavian skull - fucker .
We dispersed to our respective rooms except for Betty who remained with the beast of a stereo we had set up in the living room .
We 'd already decided which track to play .
After a few minutes of fucking around we were ready .
" Five - Four - Three - Two - One !!!
PLAY !!! "
And the house shook to its foundations !
It was like the building had a POUNDING heartbeat .
The floorboards pulsed , the light fixtures danced , shit fell off shelves , windowframes creaked and groaned to the driving and almighty racket of -
SAY YOUR PRAYERS LITTLE ONE
DON'T FORGET , MY SON
TO INCLUDE EVERYONE -
A car alarm went off outside .
Ohh , this is good !
I thought .
I loitered at the top of the stairs shouting down to Betty about how big and clever we were .
The other lads were doing exactly the same .
It was a real self - congratulatory love - in for about ten minutes .
Then I ventured down to the living room for a change of scenery .
The fucking walls were THROBBING and a strange dull whistling noise had developed in my ears , it was great .
Now , we had one of those stained glass front doors in the house , and as I cleared the last step I noticed a shape of a person outside .
Fuck !
It was only when I strained my hearing really hard I could make out the determined and constant banging on the door .
Oh , shit !
I strolled over and opened the door and there was a bloke standing there in a dress .
A black dress .
He was only a young fella , about my age , but I could tell he really was n't into Metallica at all .
He was very clean cut looking .
If it was n't for the dress he could 've worked in a bank , or been one of those normal - looking psychopaths you see on the news and think : bloody hell , he looked so normal !
His eyes were bulging and spit was spraying out of his mouth as he shouted above the racket .
" DO YOU KNOW WE'RE TRYING TO CONDUCT A FUNERAL OVER HERE !!!
HAVE YOU NO RESPECT FOR THE DEAD ??? "
Fuck ...
Our house was pretty isolated , backing onto a graveyard , trees and other green twattery everywhere .
Only we 'd forgotten that over the other side of the lovely field littered with tombstones was the parish church of Saint Stephen All Saints .
The curate calmed down when we switched the music off .
But I swear to this day he uttered the word : " cunts ! " under his breath as he turned and stormed back down the way he'd came .

The person with whom I live
When I was young , my mother ran a youth group .
As a result , at a very early age , I was aware of people going off to Oxford .
By the age of three , I had decided that I wanted to do the same .
This will turn out to be important .
The person with whom I live has been a part of my life for a long time .
We were at primary school together , and when my work was pinned to the wall , he used to tear it off and throw it in the bin .
He would predict with confidence that I would spend my adult life unemployed , and would point out that I had quite a little pot -belly .
When I went to high school , I thought I might be able to shake the person with whom I live - and he kept quiet a lot of the time , though he was reliably there in social situations making sure that I never got out of place : he did his best to point out every social and academic mishap .
On occasion , he would he appear and encourage me to bang my head against walls or tables until my face bled as the just punishment for not understanding calculus or not being able to remember bits of Latin or Russian vocabulary .
The person with whom I live has a stern sense of justice .
When I passed the Oxford entrance exam , I thought that that might shut up the person with whom I live - but when , post - interview , the rejection letter arrived , the person with whom I live framed it and hung it on the wall .
It hangs there still , 14 years later , just above my screen as I write this , as a reminder of my failure to achieve the one thing that meant anything to me as a child .
When I went to university , I thought again that I might be able to shake the person with whom I live .
Yet he shadowed me , reminding me about the limits to my abilities , about my body , about my social and emotional cack - handedness , about the disappointment to myself and everyone else that undoubtedly I was .
When I met CHCB , I made the mistake of thinking that I might have something to offer someone whom I admire .
My home situation was difficult , but I wanted to find a way through that .
The person with whom I live saved me the effort , though , by reminding me that , if I were to visit her , I 'd have to eat without going to the gym .
He would then calculate the meals I 'd have to skip , and the extra hours I 'd have to put in on the treadmill , to make up the deficit .
The person with whom I live is helpful like that .
I never once caught the train .
The relationship with CHCB ended before it began .
My current contract ends in July , and I am chasing three jobs at the moment - one of which is at my current institution , another of which is in Dublin .
The person with whom I live thinks that I should withdraw my applications , or not send them in .
After all , they wo n't amount to anything .
He tells me this and explains his reasoning at length .
The person with whom I live is scornful of my writing this now .
It is , after all , a Saturday evening .
But he is good enough to remind me that I am ugly , tubby , pasty , uninteresting , and inept , and that it would be a waste of time to consider doing anything else .
As I said - the person with whom I live is helpful .
The person with whom I live is called Iain , and I wish that he would go away .

I love my flatmates .
After years of living with people I did n't really get on with , I took a chance and moved in with my best friend and a friend who has since become another best friend .
As I type this , he 's sitting opposite me rolling a cigarette surrounded by pizza boxes and coke cans .
Anyway , we moved in to this wonderful flat near the centre of Edinburgh at the end of summer 2006 .
Three bedrooms and a boxroom ; sizable , with a very reasonable rental price .
My dad and stepmum went off on holiday and I borrowed their car .
It was a hot summer of roadtrips with a ska-punk soundtrack .
One of our regular destinations was Ikea .
We came for the hotdogs and left with crap we did n't need from the reduced to clear area .
One day , we arrived at Ikea and found a very interesting bargain sitting at the front door .
Or , should I say , 2500 interesting bargains .
Suddenly , our boxroom had a purpose beyond storing crap !
Oh yes .
A little ' recycled ' wood , some screws and we had ourselves a fully functioning ball pool .
It does n't stay up all year , it only comes out at party time .
Here are the gents themselves ; David Candy and Paul Sleggs , you guys are the best friends and flatmates a guy could want .
It 's not about the length .
It 's about the love .

I have never had a dishwasher .
This is n't the greatest hardship endured by man , but sometimes I think it would be nice to simply drop the plates into that magic white box and have them pop out steaming and clean in the morning rather than have them growing mould on my work surface for a week before I get around to chiselling the now rock hard " food " off them .
The worst thing about this yearning for a dishwasher is that I had once , for one day only .
It was the beginning of my second year at Uni and as a group myself and some of my chums were moving into a new house , it was a bit of a shithole , but it had a large living room , large garden , huge kitchen and the all important dishwasher .
We had a long day carrying boxes , unpacking porn collections , building Ikea furniture and smoking more weed than is good for anybody .
The evening came and we were al fairly shattered and decide an early night was in order , K who had not been smoking and was less tired proclaimed that she would stack the dishwasher .
No probs we thought as we all slunk off to bed .
I was first up the morning as I had raging thirst .
I stumbled to the kitchen , went back to my room to put on some clothes as I remember that I lived with people , stumbled back to the kitchen and retrieved a glass from the dishwasher .
Without paying much attention I filled the glass with cool , refreshing water and took a deep gulp .
Oh good god , it felt like I had ingested the crushed bones of mummified Gandhi !
I ran the tap to see what the problem was , it was running clear and fresh , how queer I thought to myself .
I moved my attention to the glass which I now realised had a strange frosted appearance .
I picked at the glass and white powder came away under my nail .
This really was a conundrum and when I checked inside the dish washer I found that all of the crockery , cutlery and glass wear were covered in a thin film of some sort of white powder .
Gradually my housemates emerged and we all began to discuss what could have left our eating implements in such a state .
Eventually K arrived and we quizzed her on her dishwasher usage skills .
She explained that she had taken the dishwasher powder from under the sink and ran the machine as the instructions indicated .
This seemed like a fairly good explanation , until someone made the salient point that none of us had brought any dishwasher powder with us .
“ Yes ” exclaimed K “ but I found some under the sink ! ”
She duly retrieved the dishwasher powder to show us .
It was plaster of fucking paris !
The heat from the dishwasher had baked it onto every plate , every knife and every glass ; it all had to be binned as we could n’t clean it .
As for the dishwasher we tried to flush it out , but after a couple of unsuccessful attempts it coughed , burped , farted and died for ever more .
If we cut away the outer shell and piping I guess we would have had a perfect ceramic model of the inside of an Indesit 4200 .
And that was the closest I ever came to having a dishwasher .

So many choices ...
The girls who demanded I pay a share of the food even though I ate at the work canteen or the pub every meal ?
Nah .
The girl who used my dog's flea soap rather than pay for a cake of regular soap ?
Nah .
The guy who woke me up waving a running chainsaw at my face ?
Nah .
For my money it was the girlfriend of a housemate who moved in with us , made life shit in so many petty ways , then convinced him to move out .
I 'd steadfastly refused to help him pack , confident it was a stupid move and he'd be back anyway but came back from the pub as they were about to leave .
Everything was boxed up in the truck , goodbyes were being said when she realised the CD currently playing on the stereo was " hers " .
" Um ... no , that 's mine actually , " I say .
" No it is n't , it 's mine ! " she insists , popping it out , putting it in the cover and jamming it into the last box .
" Actually , that is Difficultchild 's " , her embarrassed boyfriend explains , opening the box to take it back out .
" And ... er... so is this one .
And this one too .
Um and this one . "
" But I listen to them all the time ! "
" Well that 's fine , but they 're not actually ours , so we can't take them . "
She gets shitty , stamps her feet and glares at me as he starts removing selected CDs and handing them back .
Eventually there 's a pile of about 30 cds in front of me when he says .
" Hang on , this is Difficultchild 's book too ... "
" But I love that book ! "
" Yes , but it 's not yours ... maybe we should just have a quick look through the whole box and make sure there 's nothing else that got accidentally mixed up . "
And so began what turned out to be more than an hour of unpacking everything from the truck as every box revealed more of my stuff she had packed away because she either used it , liked it , wanted it etc .
I 'm talking CDs ( more than 100 , I was reviewing them at the time and had stacks of the things ) DVDs ( at least 30 ) , books ( about 50 ) , pots , pans , plates , kitchen knives , the blender , a pepper mill , herbs , spices , canned foods , blankets , towells , a skateboard , games , toys , my fucking guitar !!! , plants from the back yard , bottles of wine , stuff from the bathroom , stuff from the junk room ( tools , power and otherwise ) etc etc etc .
Basically if it was n't in my locked room , she 'd tried to take it .
He was mortified .
She was ropable and kept saying " But I use that ALL THE TIME !!! " or something similar .
I was delighted .
The truck was a lot lighter as they left and in the next week I got another box of stuff back he'd found while unpacking .
Then I recovered some more while visiting .
It was all too much , they had a messy break up , he took everything that was his ... actually that should read " he took everything " and moved back in .
Funnily enough I ran into her a couple of years later and she asked if I still had that book of hers she 'd loaned me .
I laughed so hard beer came out my nose .

Communal Living
I was born and brought up in a commune , and let me tell you , there were some seriously strange people there .
I was n't allowed out to school , but had to stay and work for the commune , so it was only much later that I realised quite how strange my situation was .
There was one woman ( let 's call her Liz ) who had somehow managed to get herself into position as the ' boss ' of the commune .
She was big and fat .
No , she was huge .
She had never been formally chosen as the leader , but she was so charismatic and manipulative that somehow she could always get anyone to do whatever she wanted .
She did n't do any work ( all the rest of us had to ) , we had to prepare all her meals and clear up after her .
She even made a rule that everyone in the commune would practice celibacy ( except for her of course ) .
Everyone was totally under her power .
You do n't realize it at the time , but living in a place like that can totally destroy your spirit .
It was a huge effort for me to leave , but at last I have , and now I 'm working hard at making a new life for myself without that controlling influence .
The only thing I really miss is the honey .

She was big and fat .
No , she was huge .
She had never been formally chosen as the leader , but she was so charismatic and manipulative that somehow she could always get anyone to do whatever she wanted .
She did n't do any work ( all the rest of us had to ) , we had to prepare all her meals and clear up after her .
She even made a rule that everyone in the commune would practice celibacy ( except for her of course ) .
Everyone was totally under her power .
You do n't realize it at the time , but living in a place like that can totally destroy your spirit .
It was a huge effort for me to leave , but at last I have , and now I 'm working hard at making a new life for myself without that controlling influence .
The only thing I really miss is the honey . ( , Fri 27 Feb 2009 , 16:28 , 15 replies
Scandinavian Housemate
Oystien conformed to many of the Scandinavian stereotypes we hold , being blond and sexually uninhibited .
Sadly the lack of a second X chromosome held him back from being the perfect housemate .
He 's long gone now , but you will know him if you meet him because he will tell this story to anyone after a few drinks , complete with whimsical backstory ...
Winter nights are long and cold in Norway , and drinking is the only way to get through them .
Sadly a " small beer " costs about £ 4 for about 300 ml so young people short on cash drink heavily at home before a night out at preparties / vorspiels ( sp ? ) , often drinking terrible but inexpensive home made spirits .
Lutefisk is a Scandinavian delicacy consisting of fish soaked in lye .
If that does n't sound bad enough , true gourmets believe it is more flavoursome when it has just started to ferment .
Judging whether fermentation has gone too far is something of an art , and a task made considerably more difficult after the consumption of large amounts of home distilled vodka .
One evening sees young Oystien , suffering after heavy consumption of both of the above national delicacies , reeling his merry way into the dark Scandinavian night .
Nature inevitably takes its course , and by the time he makes it into town the gut rot and rotten fish are exerting a powerful effect on his lower digestive system .
Matters " come to a head " , and he is forced to make a speedy decision .
Scandinavians are very socially minded , and public urination , or indeed defecation , carries a heavy fine , and besides the streets are crowded .
The towns only public toilet is a long walk away and the few night spots in reach have long queues of freezing revelers outside .
As another contraction hits , he finds himself outside the lighted doors of a bank , one of those which allow entry to indoor cash machines after closing .
Inspiration strikes - although the lobby doors face the street , the cash machines inside provide a screen from the street .
Not much , but enough for a desperate man to relieve himself with some degree of privacy .
So he ventures inside , and there behind the furthest cash machine , like a gift from the Gods , sits a wire waste paper basket , upon which he can squat and avoid losing his balance and falling drunkenly into his own leavings .
And squat he does , and it is good .
Oystien rationalises that a shit in a basket is less offensive and easier to clean up than a shit on the floor , and so some of his guilt is assuaged .
His business at the bank almost completed , he notices in wonder that littered around him are lots of those little receipt things the machines give , and with these he can clean himself behind .
But , as he fastens his trousers , realisation hits !
The bank would surely have installed cctv in the lobby , and the whole sordid episode would be caught on tape !
Rationalising fast , our hero makes a mental check of his attire : white trainers , baggy jeans , dark gloves , a nondescipt black jacket , and most vitally , a baseball cap !
Clothes that would not make him easy to identify , and the peak of the cap obscuring his face .
Making certain not to scan the ceiling for cameras , he exits the lobby with a spring in his step and blessedly empty bowels .
He has perpetrated the perfect crime !
Come Monday , his hangover little more than a dull sense of paranoia , he is working happily at his desk when the phone rings .
Who should it be but the local police station , and would he please present himself there before the end of the day ?
After work ,
He makes his way to the station with trepidation , but not without some confidence - he is sure he never revealed his face to the cameras , nor removed his gloves ; what evidence would the police have besides a passing visual resemblance ?
A stern faced officer takes his name at the desk , and he is made to wait before being ushered into a crowded room and sat before a TV screen in crowded room .
The officer presses a button on the video , and Oystein is treated to a ceiling mounted view of his the escapades of the past weekend .
Try as he might , our hero cannot keep a straight face .
He realises the room is full of people who have come to see his reaction .
Knowing his blushes are already giving him away , he makes full confession before the laughing audience of police .
One thing is still puzzling him .
Today is monday , and the incident was on saturday night , not two days ago .
How had they found him so fast ?
Banks have developed a mechanism to stop unwanted person entering their lobbies after closing .
Only those in possession of a bank card are able to pass through the doors .
This is checked by a simple scanner , through which one must drag ones card .
Oystein had used his own , providing his name and address to to the authorities before he had even committed a crime .

This QOTW brings a smile to my face ...
My housemates moved in a while ago - first a single girl , who we 'll call " Claire " and then about a month later , her newly single best friend , " Kate " .
No , this is n't going the way you think .
I was hesitant at first to let Kate move in .
" She can't move in if she 's just going to mope around and get teary about splitting up with her boyfriend , " I told Claire .
" She wo n't , I promise , " was the reply .
There is too much detail that I could go into for the events that follow .
I 'll give you the highlights .
Kate , fortunately , was n't too upset about splitting from her boyfriend .
Especially as she now lived with her new partner - in - crime .
In fact , she was quite positive about it all .
And a bit too keen to flaunt her newly - found singledom with her equally single best friend .
I came home one sunny afternoon to find that they 'd moved the sofa into the street , and got shitfaced on cider .
Then , with me sat there , had started flashing the local scrotes who were hanging around the street smoking weed .
I had to leave to meet friends , and told the girls that on no terms should the chavs be allowed in to the flat .
I left .
They promptly invited four of them in , " for a laugh " .
These scrawny fuckweasels must have been 18 at the most , and complete strangers - none of them even lived anywhere nearby .
I was not happy .
The next day , there were apologies , but I had to point out to them the stupidity of letting strangers into the flat - at the least , we could have been robbed .
The girls were in no state to stop them .
They had assumed I was annoyed because they were n't paying me any attention .
Seriously .
Life returned to normal for a short while , until one night when one of my friends , Dan , was staying over and was sleeping on the sofa .
I woke up in the morning , turned to switch off my alarm , and he was lying next to me .
" Erm ... morning .
What are you doing ? " I asked .
" The girls brought back a load of blokes last night at about 3 am .
They told me to fuck off out of the living room .
I would 've just stayed any way , but two of them looked like they were going to puke on me ... "
Oh .
I walked into the living room .
It was empty .
But covered in puke .
The bathroom floor had become a lake of piss .
The front door was wide open .
And my laptop had been stolen .
I bolted the front door , and got a very large knife from the kitchen .
As luck (! ) would have it , one of the guys was still asleep in bed with one of my housemates .
He was friends with the wankers who had robbed me .
And he was locked in an unfamiliar flat , with a very , very angry , knife - wielding Sloppy stood over him , and Dan looming in the background .
Frantic phone - calls where made , and my belongings were returned by some very sheepish looking teenagers .
The girls were 26 by this point , FFS .
Again , there were apologies .
Tears this time .
Kate admitted she was n't coping with being single at all , and was bringing home anyone who showed any interest to make her feel better .
Claire 's brutally honest excuse was , " I 'm a bit of slag when I 'm drunk , but this will never , ever happen again . "
I 'm a bit of soft - touch , and being a couple of years older , felt some sort of brotherly duty to give them another chance to sort themselves out .
When they were good , living with them was great , and so I decided I would try and overlook these slip - ups - they were genuinely shaken by what had happened , and it was obviously a lesson learned .
For a fortnight .
I woke up , two weeks later , at 5 am , Sunday morning , with music pounding from the living room .
The girls were in there , with 4 blokes I had never seen before ( turns out they had n't either ) all snorting ketamine off of the coffee table .
It was impossible to get any sense out of them .
Turning down the music had little effect , it went straight back up every time I left the room , several times .
I was told to fuck off , that I was being boring .
By the blokes I did n't know .
I walked out at 8 am and wandered London aimlessly for hours , grinding my teeth .
I returned home to find a stranger slumped against my bedroom door , who I kicked out of the way and then had to step over to get into my room .
For the next three hours , I listened to idiots with Special K- induced paralysis of the limbs tumble down the stair case , and then laugh hysterically , presumably because they 'd landed on a purple marshmallow made out of tits .
I did my research .
The comedown would hit them , hard , on Tuesday morning .
Monday night , they were told on no uncertain terms to get the fuck out of the flat , and left to dwell on it for the rest of the week .
And so the reason I 'm smiling ?
As I type this , they are walking backwards and forwards carrying piles of crap to a van , with looks of despair on their faces as they prepare to move back to their parents ' box rooms , since they 've blown the little money they had on drugs and booze .
Two of my friends are moving in on the weekend .
I 'm tempted to say that we 'll celebrate with a huge line of ketamine and an orgy , but unfortunately for the sake of ironic punchlines , the guys moving in are not druggy slaggy wankers .
We will however , get shitfaced and have a laugh , without inducing the urge to rip each other 's faces off , as any good houseshare should operate .
Apologies for not being particularly witty , but I am revelling in the appropriateness of this weeks question .

Blackmail Me
Still makes me feel violated , this one ...
I 've been wondering whether to confess to this , but confessing and Catholics have a similar symbiotic relationship as lemmings and cliffs .
So here goes .
When I first moved to London I secured a room in a shared house in Hackney .
I was there for about a month before I hastily packed my bags and legged it without telling anyone .
I literally ran away in shame .
The people I shared with were ok .
Everyone pretty much kept themselves to themselves .
There were a few Quentin and Saffron types , you know , the sort who would snort at me when I got out a loaf of Hovis .
One time a girl who lived there said : " Have n't you ever heard of focaccia ? "
In a pitying tone .
I responded with : " fuck - at -ya ? "
And this girl looked at me like I was a walking turd , she stormed out the kitchen in a bit of a period - tit - lip , but left me alone after that which was fine by me .
Basically , there was nothing I could n't handle .
Nice house , nice base to make my plans for world domination .
The only people I really got on with were the couple who shared the room next to mine .
He was an office - type bod , very middle of the road , a bit doughy but a nice enough fella .
She was nice too .
Rather heavy set , big fucking butchers hands and a bit of a tash , but she seemed like a nice enough person .
When I first moved in she introduced herself , Anne , she said she was a photography student and invited me out for a drink that evening .
The three of us , Anne , her boyfriend , and I ventured out to the local and sank a few jars .
We made small talk and came home .
We did this several times over the next few weeks .
It was nice .
At the time I was working really long days , I 'd be the first out the house in the morning and the last back .
So it was great to just unwind with a couple of normal people over a pint or two .
About a week before I did a runner , the tubes were on strike and being a thick twat who can't drive , I found myself stranded in the house .
My boss decided I could work from home .
Result !
So when Anne came into the kitchen in her dressing gown and saw me quite happily munching at my sugar puffs , she was quite surprised .
" Spanky !
Are n't you supposed to be working ? "
She asked , looking rather too fucking pleased to see me .
I explained that my job involved travelling all round London , and because of the tube strike I was effectively fucked .
" Oh , I just need to phone someone - I 'll be right back ! "
And she waddled out the room in a bit of a fluster .
I remember thinking she was smiling a little too much .
Oh , fuck !
I could almost see where this was leading ...
Moments later
Anne returned , still in her dressing gown .
" Spanky - I 've been meaning to ask you something ... "
" Oh ? " I replied , feeling that sinking feeling inside .
I really did n't fancy complicating my living situation by fucking the girl who lived with her boyfriend in the room next door .
Besides , she was a fucking whale .
But it was n't what I thought at all .
Not in the slightest .
Anne went on to explain she really , really , REALLY needed my help .
She was DESPERATE .
She said she was failing her photography course and had left it until the last minute to sort out her coursework .
It took a fair bit of fumbling round the subject , but eventually by the time I 'd started my second c
People have blamed the retreat of ice in the Arctic on carbon - dioxide driven global warming .
However , new research at NASA suggests that environmental intervention in the 1970s could bear most of the blame .
The elimination of aerosol particle emissions have removed a cooling element for the northern hemisphere , which has reduced a natural balance in the climate on the effect of human activities :
New research from NASA suggests that the Arctic warming trend seen in recent decades has indeed resulted from human activities : but not , as is widely assumed at present , those leading to carbon dioxide emissions .
Rather , Arctic warming has been caused in large part by laws introduced to improve air quality and fight acid rain .
Dr Drew Shindell of NASA ’s Goddard Institute of Space Studies has led a new study which indicates that much of the general upward trend in temperatures since the 1970s – particularly in the Arctic – may have resulted from changes in levels of solid “ aerosol ” particles in the atmosphere , rather than elevated CO2 .
Arctic temperatures are of particular concern to those worried about the effects of global warming , as a melting of the ice cap could lead to disastrous rises in sea level – of a sort which might burst the Thames Barrier and flood London , for instance .
Shindell ’s research indicates that , ironically , much of the rise in polar temperature seen over the last few decades may have resulted from US and European restrictions on sulphur emissions .
According to NASA : Sulfates , which come primarily from the burning of coal and oil , scatter incoming solar radiation and have a net cooling effect on climate .
Over the past three decades , the United States and European countries have passed a series of laws that have reduced sulfate emissions by 50 percent .
While improving air quality and aiding public health , the result has been less atmospheric cooling from sulfates .
On NASA ’s site , Shindell continues :
In the modeling experiment , Shindell and colleagues compiled detailed , quantitative information about the relative roles of various components of the climate system , such as solar variations , volcanic events , and changes in greenhouse gas levels .
They then ran through various scenarios of how temperatures would change as the levels of ozone and aerosols — including sulfates and black carbon — varied in different regions of the world .
Finally , they teased out the amount of warming that could be attributed to different climate variables .
Aerosols loomed large .
The regions of Earth that showed the strongest responses to aerosols in the model are the same regions that have witnessed the greatest real - world temperature increases since 1976 .
The Arctic region has seen its surface air temperatures increase by 1.5 C ( 2.7 F ) since the mid-1970s .
In the Antarctic , where aerosols play less of a role , the surface air temperature has increased about 0.35 C ( 0.6 F ) .
That makes sense , Shindell explained , because of the Arctic ’s proximity to North America and Europe .
The two highly industrialized regions have produced most of the world ’s aerosol emissions over the last century , and some of those aerosols drift northward and collect in the Arctic .
Precipitation , which normally flushes aerosols out of the atmosphere , is minimal there , so the particles remain in the air longer and have a stronger impact than in other parts of the world .
Now we have a counterargument to cap - and - trade !
Rather than pursue ridiculous and economically disastrous emission controls on naturally - occurring carbon dioxide , we can simply stop imposing aerosol controls .
That would cost less and have more impact on the problem that climate - change activists claim to want to solve .
However , there are two things wrong with that argument .
First , the modeling is as much unproven as is the CO2 - climate - change models are .
The latter completely missed the cooling trend of the last few years , which calls into question their entire premise .
Until the modeling proves itself , the science remains unsettled — as it must for people attempting to extrapolate the future by looking at only the last few hundred years on a planet billions of years old .
Second , and probably more important , most of the activists are less concerned about actual climate change than they are about having an excuse to nationalize energy production , along with everything else .
They stopped listening to “ science ” a long time ago , as soon as they heard enough to justify confiscatory government policies , and have tried to quash all other lines of inquiry with the same enthusiasm as the medieval Inquisitions , and with the same motivation — power .
Do n’t expect them to listen to NASA when the agency refutes part of their argument now .

Thousands of protesters have blocked Parliament Square in central London , calling for a ceasefire in the Sri Lankan government 's assault on the Tamil Tiger separatists .
They have surrounded a makeshift tent which houses hunger striker Parameswaran Subramaniyan , 28 , who is in a critically weak condition after two weeks of protest .
He says he will halt the action only if Britain helps secure a ceasefire in Sri Lanka .
" His condition is deteriorating day by day , " Dr Arundkumar Velauthapillai said by his bedside .
" He is not taking enough water but he is stable .
He wants a ceasefire back home . "
Parameswaran 's spokeswoman , Raji Nesajah , said : " Britain has a moral responsibility to intervene .
If he dies , it will be on Britain 's hands . "
At about 2 pm today the Rev Nicholas Sagovsky , from nearby Westminster Abbey , persuaded Parameswaran to take a sip of drink during one of his daily visits to the hunger striker .
In a statement on Saturday night , the foreign secretary , David Miliband , said he was " gravely concerned " about the situation in Sri Lanka and the government was consulting " urgently " with the United Nations .
Miliband said the prime minister 's special representative , Des Browne , was on his way to New York for talks on the Sri Lankan crisis with the UN .
The foreign secretary also repeated his call for an immediate ceasefire .
Nesajah today criticised the police for trying to move Parameswaran 's tent from Parliament Square over the weekend .
Up to 10,000 people gathered around the square this morning , some carrying Tamil Tiger flags .
Several hundred people sat on the street , blocking traffic .
They chanted : " Britain , Britain , save the Tamils " and " Gordon Brown open your eyes . "
Police vans blocked the road from the square to Westminster Bridge , where the current demonstration started on 6 April .
The police want to keep the bridge open and avert a repeat of protesters throwing themselves into the river Thames .
The Houses of Parliament were partially closed to vehicles .
Parliament Square was shut to traffic and vehicles were prevented from entering the main entrance to the House of Commons for cars .
MPs had to use the House of Lords entrance to drive into the parliamentary estate .
Bridge Street , which leads to Westminster Bridge , and part of Whitehall were also closed to traffic .
A Metropolitan police spokesman said officers had been alerted to the protest this morning .
He added that there had been no arrests .
He said : " We are aware of about 2,500 Tamil supporters gathering .
We are policing it as a protest and will amend our operation as necessary . "
Arun Sirthar , a 19 - year - old student from Bournemouth , said the protesters might try to occupy the bridge later today .
" I 'm here for the Tamils that are dying right now . "
On the first day of the demonstration two weeks ago , many of the protesters complained of police violence after officers forced them from Westminster Bridge to Parliament Square .
Scuffles involving truncheon - wielding officers also broke out when officers tried to remove red Tamil flags .
Today the police asked protesters to move but took no action when they did not .
At one point an inspector asked : " Is there anything I can do to stop you occupying the road ? "
Another inspector was surrounded by chanting protesters when he went into the crowd to ask people to move .
The protesters represent a broad spectrum of the Tamil community in Britain , from small children to older people , many of whom were shielded from the April sun under umbrellas and pieces of card .
The organisers handed out drinks and sandwiches .
Speaking from Parliament Square , the Labour MP Austin Mitchell , said : " It 's chaos , is n't it ?
I 'm sympathetic [ to the protesters ] .
The Sri Lankan government seems to be going for the kill and that 's the tragedy .
There 's a safe zone but it 's not being respected . "
He said the British government should help secure a ceasefire , but he added : " Militarily , there 's nothing we can do . "
Suren Surendiran , of the British Tamils Forum , said the demonstration was " spontaneous " and coincided with the reopening of parliament .
He said : " There have been texts going around as parliament opened today after the Easter recess and people have been encouraging their friends and families to gather .
" There is no point issuing statements .
The British Tamil community do not want words any more , we want action .
" We want to see a British government take the matter to the UN security council to get a ceasefire implemented .
" This protest will make a difference because where else can people go ?
This is a peaceful demonstration .
This is about brothers and fathers and sisters being killed .
I know people who have lost 15 members of their family .
" These are people exercising their democratic right when people across the world are having their human rights trampled on . "
Calls for a ceasefire have been rejected by the Sri Lankan government , which said a pause in the fighting would give Tamil Tiger rebels time to regroup .
The remnants of the Tigers have retreated to a slice of land that has been declared a no - fire zone .
Miliband said : " Protests and demonstrations around the world have highlighted the tragic loss of life of innocent civilians in Sri Lanka .
Further loss of life will only compound that tragedy .
" The Tamil community are a community we value and they make an important contribution to British society .
They have seen friends and relatives perish and their loved ones are still at grave risk from the fighting .
" We have heard their voice and will keep listening .
We are committed to do all we can to bring this terrible conflict to an end . "
A hundred thousand protesters marched through central London earlier this month to draw attention to the Sri Lankan government 's offensive against Tamil Tiger rebels and alleged human rights abuses .

GNOME and KDE reign supreme on the Linux desktop , but there are many lesser - known desktop environments that are increasingly popular among users who are looking for lightweight alternatives that deliver more streamlined interfaces and a functional user experience with less overhead .
The Xfce project , which produces one of the most polished lightweight desktop environments , recently announced the release of version 4.6 .
Xfce is widely used on legacy hardware and systems that lack the resources to run more comprehensive environments .
It has also recently gained a large following on Linux - based netbook devices where its fast start - time and slim profile are highly valued .
Xfce is also a favorite among Linux users who prefer simpler and less intrusive software .
It requires few dependencies and is built with the GTK + toolkit .
It is often praised for its high modularity , a characteristic that reflects a strong affinity with the component - oriented UNIX philosophy .
The new version of Xfce brings some significant improvements , including rich support for session management and several new configuration utilities .
These enhancements demonstrate that Xfce can provide the most important accoutrements of a modern desktop environment without compromising its low - fat design goals .
I tested Xfce 4.6 on openSUSE 11.1 with the new packages from the build service .
For details about how to install the packages on openSUSE , check out the blog entry by package maintainer Pavol Rusnak .
So far , it seems to be working pretty well and I have n't run into any problems with it .
The improved session manager makes it possible for core components of the environment , such as the panel and the file manager , to automatically restart in the event of a crash .
The session management preference dialog has also been improved to provide users with greater control .
This release also introduces official support for suspend and hibernate — features that are particularly important on netbook devices .
Xfce 's window manager , which is called Xfwm , is moderately customizable and has advanced features like shading and edge snapping .
It also has its own robust compositing engine which is used to support window transparency and shadows ( it 's worth noting that Xfwm can do compositing quite well without hardware - accelerated graphics and proprietary drivers .
It even works in VirtualBox ) .
In the 4.6 release , the compositing feature has been leveraged to reduce flickering .
The window manager also gained support for allowing users to easily terminate unresponsive windows .
The environment 's current file manager , which is called Thunar , was first introduced in the 4.4 release to replace the aging Xffm ( nobody agrees with me , but I still think that Xffm 's slightly convoluted dual - tree interface is pure awesomeness ) .
Thunar uses less memory than other file managers and has a clean and simple user interface .
In the new version , Thunar has gained support for encrypted devices , the XDG user directory specification , and drive mounting .
The desktop manager also has improved support for icon selection and has added the ability to use a lasso to select multiple icons at once .
Other important enhancements in this release are a new GStreamer - based volume control mixer , an application finder , and better panel plugins .
For more information about the new features , check out the project 's official release notes and screenshot tour .
The " Text " ( SMS ) application on the iPhone uses a custom , semi- transparent view to show its " Sending ... " message over the keyboard .
I 'll show you a simple class that can display semi- transparent loading messages and how you can display messages over the keyboard .
Introduction
" Loading ... " messages
When waiting for data loaded from the internet , many iPhone applications use a mostly black , semi-transparent view to block the display .
Most use a basic " spinner " ( UIActivityIndicatorView ) to reassure the user that the application is still running , frequently accompanied by " Loading ... " text .
Despite the prevalence of this type of loading message , it is not a standard control and must be constructed manually .
Finding the keyboard
Apple give no methods to locate the keyboard or even the current first responder in an iPhone application .
I 'll show you how you can find both .
The sample application
The sample LoadingView application in this post can display the following two types of loading window :
A full - window loading message and a keyboard - only loading message .
The sample application does n't actually load anything .
The " Refresh " button displays the full - window loading message for 5 seconds and the text field lets you enter some text and hit " Send " to see the keyboard - only loading message for 5 seconds .
Displaying a loading view
A loading view is not the most complicated piece of custom user - interface but there are a handful of common behaviors it should implement so it is a good idea to have a reusable class for the purpose .
The behaviors in my loading view include :
Always fill the whole view that it blocks ( even though it looks inset on all sides for aesthetic reasons ) .
Fade in and fade out when added and removed .
Semi-transparent , allowing the unloaded view to show through .
Autoresizeable so that a portrait to landscape rotation during loading wo n't disrupt the display .
Displays a centered status message and activity indicator .
To ensure that these behaviors are applied to the view on construction , I use a loading ViewInView : method instead of a normal constructor .
This method constructs , adds to superview and handles the fade animation all at once .
+ ( id ) loadingViewInView : ( UIView * ) a Superview { LoadingView * loadingView = [ [ [ LoadingView alloc ] initWithFrame :[ a Superview bounds ] ] autorelease ] ; if ( ! loadingView ) { return nil ; } loading View .
opaque = NO ; loading View .
autoresizingMask = UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleWidth | UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleHeight ; [ aSuperview addSubview : loadingView ] ; //
Code to create and configure the label and activity view goes here .
//
Download the sample project to see it .
//
Set up the fade - in animation CATransition * animation = [ CATransition animation ] ; [ animation setType : kCATransitionFade ] ; [ [ aSuperview layer ] addAnimation : animation forKey : @ " layerAnimation " ] ; return loading View ; }
All that 's required to make it look semi- transparent is a custom drawing method .
- ( void ) drawRect : ( CGRect ) rect { rect .
size .
height -= 1 ; rect .
size .
width -= 1 ; const CGFloat RECT_PADDING = 8.0 ; rect = CGRectInset ( rect , RECT_PADDING , RECT_PADDING ) ; const CGFloat ROUND_RECT_CORNER_RADIUS
= 5.0 ; CGPathRef roundRectPath = NewPathWithRoundRect ( rect , ROUND_RECT_CORNER_RADIUS
) ; CGContextRef context = UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext ( ) ; const CGFloat BACKGROUND_OPACITY
= 0.85 ; CGContextSetRGBFillColor ( context , 0 , 0 , 0 , BACKGROUND_OPACITY ) ; CGContextAddPath ( context , roundRectPath ) ; CGContextFillPath ( context ) ; const CGFloat STROKE_OPACITY = 0.25 ; CGContextSetRGBStrokeColor ( context , 1 , 1 , 1 , STROKE_OPACITY ) ; CGContextAddPath ( context , roundRectPath ) ; CGContextStrokePath ( context ) ; CGPathRelease ( roundRectPath ) ; }
Round Rects are Everywhere !
I continue to find it strange that Apple do n't provide a function to draw a round rectangle in one line .
They do provide the ( more flexible ) CGPathAddArcToPoint function but it lacks the simplicity of a single line function to handle the common case .
Download the project and see how the implementation of NewPathWithRoundRect creates round rects using the CGPathAddArcToPoint function if you do n't know how to draw round rects on the iPhone .
The absence of a round rectangle function is particularly strange given the anecdote that Andy Hertzfeld relates on folklore.org and in his excellent book Revolution in the Valley .
In this anecdote , Steve Jobs drags Bill Atkinson on a walk around the block with Steve pointing out how everything is made of round rects until Bill relents and agrees to put the RoundRect function into Quickdraw .
Round rectangles continue to be everywhere on the iPhone — maybe more so than on the Mac in 1984 .
It 's a good idea to use a function like NewPathWithRoundRect in your own code .
Finding the keyboard
The keyboard on the iPhone is an instance of UIKeyboard ( a private class ) in its own UIWindow ( actually , it may share the window with the UIAutoCorrectInlineView ) .
You can find the UIKeyboard with a simple search .
@implementation UIApplication ( KeyboardView ) - ( UIView * ) keyboardView { NSArray * windows = [ self windows ] ; for ( UIWindow * window in [ windows reverseObjectEnumerator ] ) { for ( UIView * view in [ window subviews ] ) { if ( ! strcmp ( object_getClassName ( view ) , " UIKeyboard " ) ) { return view ; } } } return nil ; } @end
The keyboard itself is a series of nested views which eventually reach the underlying functionality for the keys :
UIKeyboard
UIKeyboardImpl
UIKeyboardLayoutQWERTY
UIKeyboardSublayout
UIImageView
UIKeyboardSpaceKeyView
UIKeyboardReturnKeyView
Interestingly , the keys for the main part of the keyboard are all a single image .
This arrangement probably explains why the " space " and " return " keys behave more like regular buttons than the other keys .
For the sample application , since the implementation of LoadingView will size the loading view to cover its immediate superview , passing the keyboard view fetched in this manner will create the keyboard - only loading view shown above .
If you wanted to show a full - window Loading View that also covers the keyboard , you could pass the keyboard view 's superview to the loading ViewInView : but you might want to add an extra 20 pixels padding at the top in this case , since the superview ( the window ) extends underneath the status bar at the top of the window .
Finding the firstResponder
While it is n't required for the sample project , I thought I 'd mention how to fetch a related piece of information : the firstResponder in an iPhone application .
On the iPhone firstResponder is the view which has the current keyboard focus ( or nil if no view is focussed ) .
This is an important piece of information , so it 's strange that Apple did n't choose to provide a public method to access it .
Curiously , there is a method , firstResponder , on UIWindow which returns this value but it is n't public .
This will work :
UIView * firstResponder = [ [ UIApplication sharedApplication ] keyWindow ] performSelector : @selector ( firstResponder ) ] ;
Conclusion
You can see all this code and more in the sample project for this post : LoadingView.zip ( 129kB )
Displaying a loading view is not a very difficult task ( lots of people write their own ) but implementing all of the different expected behaviors is time consuming — the implementation in this post is at least 65 lines of code , depending on how you count it — so keeping a resusable implementation can save a lot of time .
Finding the keyboard and finding the current first responder on the iPhone are harder to work out since the API is hidden , and it requires a little investigative work .
Putting it all together , you could easily recreate Apple 's " Sending ... " progress view used in the Text program .

MISSOURI STATE POLICE THINK YOU AND I ARE TERRORISTS
By Chuck Baldwin
March 17 , 2009
NewsWithViews.com
Thanks to a concerned Missouri state policeman , a nationally syndicated radio talk show host stated that he was alerted last week to a secret Missouri state police report that categorized supporters of Congressman Ron Paul , Bob Barr , and myself as " ' militia ' influenced terrorists . "
The report , he said , " instructs the Missouri police to be on the lookout for supporters displaying bumper stickers and other paraphernalia associated with the Constitutional , Campaign for Liberty , and Libertarian parties . "
Ignoring the threat of Muslim terrorists , the Missouri Information Analysis Center ( MIAC ) report focuses on the so - called " militia movement " and " conflates it with supporters of Ron Paul , Chuck Baldwin , Bob Barr , the so - called patriot movement and other political activist organizations opposed to the North American Union and the New World Order . "
This report is not original , of course .
During the Clinton administration , a Phoenix Federal Bureau of Investigation and Joint Terrorism Task Force explicitly designated " defenders " of the Constitution as " right - wing extremists . "
However , the MIAC report significantly expands on earlier documents and is the first known document to actually name names .
According to the MIAC , opposition to world government , NAFTA , federalization of the states , and restrictive gun laws are a potential threat to the police .
The MIAC report also refers to Aaron Russo's film , " America : Freedom to Fascism . "
The story exposing the MIAC report states , " The MIAC report is particularly pernicious because it indoctrinates Missouri law enforcement in the belief that people who oppose confiscatory taxation , believe in the well - documented existence of a New World Order and world government ( a Google search of this phrase will pull up numerous references made by scores of establishment political leaders ) , and are opposed to the obvious expansion of the federal government at the expense of the states as violent extremists who are gunning for the police .
It specifically targets supporters of mainstream political candidates and encourages police officers to consider them dangerous terrorists . "
See the report here :
The Columbia Daily Tribune also carried the story last Saturday .
It quoted Missouri resident Tim Neal of Miller County .
" When Neal read the report , he could n't help but think it described him .
A military veteran and a delegate to the 2008 Missouri Republican state convention , he did n't appreciate being lumped in with groups like the Neo - Nazis .
" 'I was going down the list and thinking , " Check , that 's me , " ' he said .
' I 'm a Ron Paul supporter , check .
I talk about the North American union , check .
I 've got the " America : Freedom to Fascism " video loaned out to somebody right now .
So that means I 'm a domestic terrorist ?
Because I 've got a video about the Federal Reserve ? ' "
The Tribune 's report also acknowledges , " The [ MIAC ] report 's most controversial passage states that militia ' most commonly associate with third - party political groups ' and support presidential candidates such as Ron Paul , former Constitutional [ sic ]
Party candidate Chuck Baldwin and Bob Barr , the Libertarian candidate last year . "
The Tribune report also said , " Neal , who has a Ron Paul bumper sticker on his car , said the next time he is pulled over by a police officer , he wo n't know whether it 's because he was speeding or because of his political views . "
See the Columbia Tribune report here :
I realize that there are people who will dismiss this kind of story as insignificant .
They should n't .
This is very serious and should be treated as such .
Anyone who knows anything at all about history knows that before a state or national government can persecute -- and commit acts of violence against - - a group of people , they must first marginalize the group from society 's mainstream and categorize it as dangerous .
Rome did exactly that to Christians , as did Mao's China ; Hitler 's Germany did the same thing to Jews ; Stalin 's Russia did the same thing to political dissenters , etc .
That a State police agency in America would actually infer that people who supported Ron Paul , Bob Barr , or myself in a political campaign are somehow indistinguishable from violence - prone " militias " is beyond insulting : it is a smear campaign , and might should even be regarded as a hate crime !

Beyond that , the MIAC report paints with a very broad brush .
In addition to supporting Ron Paul , Bob Barr , or myself , a review of the report reveals that opposition to any of the following risks someone being classified as a potential " domestic terrorist " :
The New World Order
The United Nations
Gun Control
The violation of Posse Comitatus
The Federal Reserve
The Income Tax
The Ammunition Accountability Act
A possible Constitutional Convention ( Con Con )
The North American Union
Universal Service Program
Radio Frequency Identification ( RFID )
Abortion on demand
Illegal Immigration
Again , if you oppose any of the above , or if you supported Ron Paul , Bob Barr , or myself , you risk being labeled a " domestic terrorist , " according to the MIAC .
Do you not see how dangerous this kind of slanderous labeling can become ?
It could affect your flight status when you try to board an airline .
It could affect your application for sensitive jobs .
It could affect your adjudication before a court or judge .
It could make you a target for aggressive law enforcement strategies .
It could affect your being able to obtain a passport .
It could affect one 's ability to purchase a firearm or receive a State concealed weapon permit .
This is very serious business !
We are not talking about private opinions .
We are talking about law enforcement agencies .
And remember , most law enforcement agencies share these types of reports ; therefore , how many other state police agencies have similar reports floating around ?
Probably several .
Plus , how do we know that this report was not influenced by federal police agencies ?
We do n't .
Rest assured , I do not plan to take this lying down .
As one who is personally named in the above report , I demand a public retraction and apology from the MIAC and Missouri State Police .
I can tell you that my family is extremely distraught that their husband , father , and grandfather would be labeled in such a manner .
I am also not ruling out legal action .
In addition , I am discussing an appropriate response with Ron Paul and Bob Barr .
I will keep readers posted as to what comes of these discussions ( as I am at liberty to do so , of course ) .
In the meantime , I encourage everyone who believes in the freedom of speech and who believes that the MIAC report is an egregious miscarriage of justice to contact the appropriate Missouri police officials .

And lest one thinks that none of this concerns him or her , I would like to remind you of the lament of Martin Niemoeller back in the days of Hitler 's Germany .
Niemoeller was a decorated U - Boat Captain and pastor of great distinction .
An avid anti-communist , Niemoeller at first supported Hitler 's rise to power and was hesitant to oppose the violations of civil rights against various groups he personally found distasteful .
It did not take long , however , before Niemoeller realized that when laws protecting the rights of all were removed from some , no one was safe -- including him .
Unfortunately , he learned his lesson too late , as he , too , was persecuted and imprisoned by Hitler 's State Police .
Here is what Niemoeller said about his indifference :
" They came first for the communists , and I did not speak up -
because I was not a communist ;
And then they came for the trade unionists , and I did not speak up - because I was not a trade unionist ;
And then they came for the Jews , and I did not speak up because I was not a Jew ;
And then they came for me - and there was no one left to speak up . "

So , those of you who think you have nothing to fear because you did not vote for Ron Paul , Bob Barr , or me , or because you do not live in the State of Missouri need to think again .
As I have repeatedly said , we either have freedom for all , or we have freedom for none .
Truly , secret police reports such as the one above threaten the liberties of us all .
So , will you speak up now or wait until they come for you and no one is left to speak up ?

Ian McDonald is one of science fiction 's finest working writers , and his latest short story collection Cyberabad Days , is the kind of book that showcases exactly what science fiction is for .
Cyberabad Days returns to McDonald 's India of 2047 , a balkanized state that we toured in his 2006 novel River of Gods , which was nominated for the best novel Hugo Award .
The India of River of Gods has fractured into a handful of warring nations , wracked by water - shortage and poverty , rising on rogue technology , compassion , and the synthesis of the modern and the ancient .
In Cyberabad Days , seven stories ( one a Hugo winner , another a Hugo nominee ) McDonald performs the quintessential science fictional magic trick : imagining massive technological change and making it intensely personal by telling the stories of real , vividly realized people who leap off the page and into our minds .
And he does this with a deft prose that is half - poetic , conjuring up the rhythms and taste and smells of his places and people , so that you are really , truly transported into these unimaginably weird worlds .
McDonald 's India research is prodigious , but it 's nothing to the fabulous future he imagines arising from today 's reality .
All seven of these stories are standouts , but if I had to pick only three to put in a time - capsule for the ages , they 'd be :
1. The Djinn 's Wife : this Hugo - winning novelette is a heartbreaking account of a love affair between a minor celebrity and a weakly godlike artificial intelligence .
The special problems of love with an " aeai " ( AI ) are incredibly , thoroughly imagined here , as are the possible glories .
Here , McDonald perfectly captures the stepping - off - a - cliff feeling of the new kinds of romance that technology enables , and of the wonderful , terrible sense of the wind rushing past your ears as the ground screams towards you .
2. Sanjeev and Robotwallah : a story that will be anthologized in two of this year 's " Best Of " anthologies , Sanjeev and Robotwallah is the story of a young , displaced boy who finds temporary glory in acting as batsman for a squadron of amped - up teen mecha pilots .
The pathos here arises when the war ends and the glamorous warriors are retired , leaving Sanjeev in limbo , his aspirations smashed with the lives of the older boys .
Like all of McDonald 's stories , the ending is bittersweet , rich and unexpected .
3. Vishnu at the Cat Circus : the long , concluding novella in the volume is an account of three siblings : one genetically enhanced to be a neo -Brahmin , one a rogue AI wallah who is at the center of the ascension of humanity 's computers into a godlike state , and one who remains human and bails out the teeming masses who are tossed back and forth by the technological upheaval .
A story of character , Vishnu blends spirituality and technology to look at how the street might find its own use for things , when that street is rooted in ancient traditions that are capable of assimilating enormous ( but not infinite ) change .
Cyberabad Days has it all : spirituality , technology , humanity , love , sex , war , environmentalism , politics , media — all blended together to form a manifesto of sorts , a statement about how technology shapes and is shaped by all the wet , gooey human factors .
Every story is simultaneously a cracking yarn , a thoughtful piece of technosocial criticism , and a bag of eyeball kicks that 'll fire your imagination .
The field is very lucky to have Ian McDonald working in it .

He has four wives and he faced 783 counts of corruption : PETER HITCHENS on South Africa 's next president
By PETER HITCHENS
Imagine how you would react if Gordon Brown opened and closed his election rallies by bursting into a song called Bring Me My Machine Gun , swaying and jigging to the hypnotic chorus of this menacing ditty .
And how would you feel if the Prime Minister were alleged to be taking campaign money from Colonel Gaddafi ; faced 783 counts of fraud , racketeering , tax evasion and corruption which somehow never came to court ; and had been acquitted of rape while his fearsome supporters mobbed the courthouse ?
Then ponder how you would despair if , despite all these things , Mr Brown 's party was certain to win the election whatever he did or said .
If you can picture all this happening here , then you have an inkling of the horrible process South Africa is now going through .
Except it is much , much worse .
Danse macabre : Zuma loves to dress , and dance , like a Zulu warrior
This fast - approaching catastrophe is a source of shame and apprehension to millions of honest people , white and black , in South Africa itself .
It is also a tragedy for Africa as a whole , a continent hungry for any reason to hope .
And it is grave news for the civilised world , which needs no more failed states .
Yet I can promise you I will be accused of alarmism and pessimism for saying so , and quite possibly of ' racism ' too .
Why ?
All the soppy admirers of Nelson Mandela - especially the BBC - gave the new South Africa a free pass when apartheid ended 15 years ago .
They wanted to believe this complicated and important nation had become a sort of heaven on Earth where all tears were dried and all problems solved .
Mr Mandela himself , personally decent but politically ineffectual and naive , served as both figurehead and figleaf for the new order .
The world ignored or forgave his continuing friendships with the world 's worst despots , and the fraudulent bungling that surrounded him .
Now , looking frail , bemused and ancient , he recently had to be helped on to the stage by his suspect would - be successor , to endorse the grotesque rabble who seek to succeed him .
Once , South Africa dominated the nightly news for weeks on end .
Now the liberal media barely mention it .
Why not ?
Because post - apartheid South Africa is a failure .
You do n't hear about the terrifying crime .
You do n't hear about the pestilence of corruption , or the absurd purchase of needless submarines and aircraft for a country with no serious enemies except its own elite .
There is a little about AIDS , but nothing like as much as there should be , given the acres of graves that commemorate the government 's moronic policies , of denial and folk remedies ( including beetroot ) .
Violent xenophobic rage against uncontrolled mass immigration was played down both in South Africa and abroad because it did not fit the smiley picture beloved by the Mandela worshippers .
And little is said about the unstoppable spread of shanty towns , far outstripping state attempts to build proper houses for the poor .
Electricity blackouts - the invariable sign of a country on the slide - are now frequent .
The ill - run nuclear power station inherited from the apartheid regime 's atom bomb programme is beginning to judder and fail , raising fears of an African Chernobyl .
Then there are the overstretched water supply , the railway system fraying at the edges and the unguarded borders open to migrants and refugees from every destitute nation in Africa .
It is largely thanks to these new arrivals that wretched , instant slums sprout right up to the edge of Cape Town 's slick new airport , currently being expensively modernised ready for the World Cup next year during which Mandela groupies will doubtless once again swoon about the ' success ' of the Rainbow Nation .
New order : Peter Hitchens with Zuma 's supporters in Springbok
Of course much of tourist South Africa still looks like the American West Coast : smooth six - lane highways , shopping malls , big houses in shady gardens , all tended by cheap black servants .
But close to the prettiness is fear and apprehension .
Even in the lovely Cape wine country , squatter camps have erupted on the outskirts of towns where chefs drizzle olive oil on to fancy salads less than a mile from open sewers and gang wars among corrugated iron shacks .
Here is another world , much bigger than the tourist paradise , and truly , cruelly poor .
It is also increasingly hostile to the soft enclaves where the new rich and the holidaymakers are apparently oblivious of the filth , hunger , alcoholic stupor , drug - taking and wretchedness which lie just the other side of every hill .
Like ice and fire , these two societies cannot coexist forever , and when one is 40 million strong and the other one tenth of that , there is little doubt which will win .
The only question is how and when the dreamtime will end .
In the coming weeks , South Africa seems to me to be taking several definite steps towards its cold , shocking awakening - as a full member of the Third World .
The man who will lead it there is called Jacob Zuma .
Remember the name .
You are going to hear a lot more of it .
Zuma is wholly African .
He has at least four wives and 18 children .
He has for years avoided standing trial on fraud and corruption charges .
Nobody seriously believes he ever will : his approaching election is already spreading fear in South Africa 's legal establishment .
Mr Zuma joined the Communist Party in 1962 ( he only left a few years ago ) , and has a dark and inadequately examined past as a much - feared intelligence chief in the ANC 's ruthless armed wing , Spear of the Nation .
He underwent ' military training ' in the old Soviet Union in 1978 , when the KGB was very much in charge of such things .
On April 22 he will become President of one of the world 's most important countries .
Comrade Zuma , as his supporters know him , certainly is not dull .
And South Africa will not be dull either when he takes over .
Many fear it will rapidly become a lawless kleptocracy when he comes to power , which he will do after a hopelessly one - sided and rather crooked election .
The grisly Winnie Mandela , a convicted fraud with a creepy past , is number five on the ANC 's parliamentary election list , despite the fact that as a criminal she is legally banned from being an MP .
She is expected to be a minister in any Zuma government .
Zuma 's old friend and business partner , Schabir Shaik , has just been released early - on medical grounds , although almost nobody believes this - from a 15 - year sentence imposed in 2006 for fraud and corruption , including a payment to Zuma himself .
An ailing Nelson Mandela is helped on to the stage at a rally by the bespectacled Zuma , the man he is endorsing as the next President of South Africa
Jackie Selebi , the National Police Commissioner , is famous for asking , ' what 's all the fuss about ? ' when taxed with the country 's appalling levels of crime and violence .
He is currently suspended , accused of having - yes - a ' generally corrupt relationship ' with a convicted drug smuggler and also ' defeating the ends of justice ' .
The once - admired Scorpions , a police anti-corruption squad symbolising the country 's determination not to follow the rest of Africa into corrupt squalor , have been disbanded .
So the approaching enthronement of this sinister , populist one - time Zulu herd - boy really ought to mark the moment when South Africa has to stop dreaming about rainbows and miracles , and recognise that experience is usually a better guide to the future than hope .
Zuma is attractive in some ways .
He has made his way up from utter poverty .
He is a fighter , a keen and hypocrisy - free lover of women and a cunning charmer .
He makes no pretence of being Westernised , and delights in wearing traditional Zulu dress , leopardskin , loincloth and all .
He has an excellent singing voice , as I can testify .
He comes from the deep heart of Zululand , where his home is surprisingly modest but guarded by a modern security fence .
It lies in the Nkandla district , in the lovely Zulu highlands a morning 's drive from the Victorian battlefields of Isandlwana , where the Zulus destroyed a British army , and Rorke 's Drift , where a small British force survived against enormous odds .
South Africa 's largest tribe are a proud fighting people , and Zuma will not be a mild leader , as Mandela and Thabo Mbeki , his two forerunners , were .
This , not the far - off world of Cape Town , is the real South Africa .
It is currently tense and frightening , as well as obviously poor and ravaged by AIDS .
Young men , brought up in the warrior spirit , wander in angry and resentful groups , strikingly unlike the more peaceful Xhosas to the south .
My Zulu guide , Emmanuel , is afraid I might be mistaken for a policeman or rival political campaigner , so he lends me his jacket so I 'll blend in better , and is pleased when our car is caked with red mud , as he is afraid it looks too much like a police vehicle .
This area is generally run by the Zulu nationalist Inkatha Party , and opponents have died at their rallies .
Interlopers are unwelcome .
There are Zuma posters , but the ANC - mistrusted here as a mainly Xhosa party - has to come into these districts under heavy police escort .
The posters are nailed on electricity poles about 15 ft up , to stop Inkatha militants tearing them down .
' People around here will vote for Zuma because he is a Zulu , but in spite of the fact that he is from the ANC , ' one local explains .
Menacing : Jacob Zuma dances to what has become his signature song , Bring Me My Machine Gun !
The idea that tribal loyalty does n't matter any more in South Africa , spread for years by blinkered optimists , seems absurd here - and tribal rivalry might well play a part in the more troubled future , as it has everywhere else in Africa .
This is also a very old - fashioned place , where the price of a wife is still 11 cows , and polygamy is normal .
Zuma has already considered how to cope with this tricky detail when working out which of his wives will be his First Lady .
He explains : ' There is no First Lady .
If there is an occasion , one day we will have the wife we are with , another day we will have another one . '
He defends his domestic arrangements by saying of his more conventional critics : ' Many of them have wives , girlfriends and children that they try to hide .
I love all my wives and children and I 'm proud of them , so I 'm completely open about it . '
Several of his wives praise Zuma as a family man .
Alas for him , another has indicted him from beyond the grave .
Kate Mantsho , mother of five of his children , killed herself with an overdose in 2000 , and left a devastating suicide note denouncing him .
In one harrowing passage she said : ' I hope it is true we will meet again - but not as husband and wife .
I dare not take that chance again due to the bitter and most painful 24 years of married life I have gone through . '
South African coverage of this event was muted , and many journalists denounced the small newspaper that broke the story .
Zuma himself has carried on as if Kate 's note had never been published .
He is above all a Zulu , a man who holds to ancient traditions and customs .
Whatever he can be accused of ( and it is quite a lot ) he is not an urban liberal .
He once spoke of how , in his youth , he would knock down any ' pansy boy ' .
He has also said same - sex marriage was a ' disgrace to the nation ' .
He has hinted he might restore the death penalty .
He is keen on traditional medicine men .
He thinks teenage unwed mothers should have their babies taken away ; that school prayers should be compulsory and that there is too much sex on TV .
He completely lacks the Westernised polish and smoothness of Mandela and Mbeki .
His political party , the African National Congress , sometimes seems aghast that it has chosen him as leader .
Too late .
The ANC 's gruesomely Stalinist communist faction , the most powerful communist party outside China , thought they could use him as a battering ram against the more cautious Mbeki , a cold and solitary academic .
Mbeki sought above all to keep Western investors happy , thus disappointing the communist radicals who wanted to invest in socialist projects .
They hoped they could control Zuma or perhaps push him aside after he had done their dirty work .
But he is far cleverer than he looks .
At first sight he is the jovial double of the Michelin man , bald , bespectacled and wide - mouthed .
As he campaigns , he wears a Nelson Mandela T - shirt ( his aides sport Jacob Zuma shirts ) and a bizarre black leather cowboy hat .
I watched him electioneering in and around the bleak and stony town of Springbok , in South Africa 's remote and conservative North West .
He arrived for a carefully staged visit to Elizabeth Cloete , a 49 - year - old who dwells on an arid hillside in a hovel made of plastic sheets , and lives by scrabbling through rubbish dumps looking for saleable scrap - a trade that brings her about £ 6 a week .
Her neighbourhood is the bitter end of rural South Africa , many of whose inhabitants exist , in a permanent haze of cheap drink or drugs , defeated and without hope .
Zuma must know that places like this , and their still crueller and more violent urban equivalents , are evidence of the ANC 's failure , in 15 years of unrestricted power , to keep its ambitious promises to the poor .
He actually admitted later that day : ' We came here to see the conditions .
The conditions are extremely bad .'
But when I tried , courteously , to speak to him on the spot , having failed to obtain an interview over several weeks , he brushed me aside .
Worse , I was menacingly reproved by an ANC apparatchik , outraged that I should dare to question the next President .
I was also upbraided by a smug , dreadlocked member of the Johannesburg Press corps who sneered at me , ' This is Africa , man , we do things differently here . '
They certainly do .
Zuma 's admission that conditions are dreadful was about the only truthful thing in his speech , made to a few thousand listless supporters in a bleak rugby stadium on the edge of town , after efforts to work them into a frenzy had failed .
' Viva ANC ! ' shouted the master of ceremonies .
No response .
' Viva Zuma ! '
No response .
And you can't blame them .
Speaking in English , the future President has all the charisma of an ashtray .
The scripted slogans fall from his lips like blobs of cold porridge .
He talks of the fight against crime as if he were not himself overshadowed by criminal charges and the unabashed friend of convicted crooks .
As he drones , the chatter from the audience becomes almost deafening .
Most of them do not speak English anyway .
He wins a little applause for claiming that corrupt officials will be removed .
One departing member of the crowd openly sniggers as Zuma declares : ' We do n't want people to say that the ANC is a corrupt organisation because of corrupt individuals . '
But the multitude springs back into life when Zuma switches to his native Zulu and , in a rich and powerful baritone , begins to sing the song with which he will always be associated , dancing and swaying as he does so .
Bring Me My Machine
Gun is surprisingly catchy , and easy to join in .
It only has two lines , and the second goes , rather politely , ' Please bring me my machine gun . '
What is he doing here , in this arid dorp halfway to Nigeria ?
The truth is that the ANC faces a rebellion , and is trying to quell it with a mixture of power and pay - outs .
A breakaway , called the Congress of the People ( COPE ) , has just scored surprisingly well in council by - elections near Springbok .
Zuma 's allies , furious that for the first time they face serious opponents , have let their rage show in ways which have rightly scared many peaceful South Africans .
The ANC youth league chief Julius Malema , a portly young loudmouth with a gift for rabble - rousing , has declared that his movement was ready to ' take up arms and kill for Zuma ' .
He has since been made to apologise , but many are unconvinced .
Another ANC youth league militant said COPE ' behave like cockroaches and they must be destroyed ' .
The word ' cockroaches ' leaves a specially nasty taste in Africa .
Hutu fanatics repeatedly used the same insult to describe their Tutsi neighbours in Rwanda , shortly before the 1994 massacres that horrified the world .
No African is unaware of this .
Allan Boesak , a leading figure in COPE , told me the ANC tries to silence his party by the crudest methods .
He warns that a Zuma government will mean ' far more concentration of socialist power , less democracy , new laws to curtail the Press ' .
He also claims the ANC tried to recruit him as a parliamentary candidate , assuring him it had plenty of money for his campaign - including cash from the Libyan leader , Colonel Gaddafi .
' They think they own democracy , ' he says , and adds that public officials who endorse COPE are harassed and denounced by colleagues : ' When we try to book a venue , the hall is always " under repair " , or if that fails they organise discos next door to drown out our speakers . '
In Springbok , the COPE offices are just down the road from the ANC headquarters .
Painted on the side of the COPE building is a large arrow pointing directly at the ANC building , and the words : ' Tell no lies ' .
The ANC response has been cynical beyond belief .
Ever since COPE did well in local polls , ANC officials have been promising free food parcels to those who stay loyal to them .
Regrettably , the tactic has already won back significant support .
Judging by the Springbok rally 's warm response to Jacob Zuma 's sing - song and the food parcel strategy , the ANC steamroller will triumph here and almost everywhere else .
The one place most likely to resist is the Western Cape , the area round Cape Town itself and the heartland of Helen Zille , the popular and effective mayor of Cape Town and leader of the Democratic Alliance .
She knows the Alliance must break out of being nothing more than a white liberal party .
But alas she is a white liberal , albeit a very impressive one .
I caught up with her at Stellenbosch University , where she was speaking to an almost wholly white student audience , switching easily from English to Afrikaans .
Unlike Zuma , she is a witty , fluent orator .
She does not break into song , and critics joke that if she did it would be ' Bring me my cappuccino ' rather than ' Bring me my machine gun ' .
Her aides , however , point out that she also speaks fluent Xhosa , Nelson Mandela 's language , and that many of her meetings are full of black and brown faces .
But her cogent message really appeals only to the well - educated , who are not influenced by tribal loyalties , or open to bribery .
Her words are heavy with fear for the future .
' The closed crony system , ' she warns , ' leads to power abuse and eventually to a criminal state . '
She urges her supporters to concentrate on reducing the ANC 's vote and get it used to the idea of real democracy .
Otherwise it will misuse its excessive power - something she warns ' inevitably leads to Zimbabwe ' .
Liberation movements such as the ANC , she says , make bad democratic governments because they believe their goal is to seize power .
The diagnosis is impressive , cool and clear .
The cure : a real law - governed democracy , is attractive .
But the prognosis - a rigged and menacing election , a government founded on lawlessness and an uneducated , cunning new leader , an African ' Big Man ' with his roots in tribe and tradition - is not so good .
How distressing to think it might never have come to this if the world had been more critical , and more interested , during the long wasted years of Nelson Mandela and Thabo Mbeki .
Wide - eyed idealism has let us down again , as it always does .
It was not , as the fashionable people claimed , a fairy story .
History did not stop when Nelson Mandela ended his long walk to freedom .
They are not all going to live happily ever after .

On the surface , JPMorgan Chase ’sfirst quarter 2009 earnings look auspicious , reversing the red ink of the last few quarters and exceeding what was expected by investors .
But a simple read - throughof the press release paints a different picture .
The bank made good profits on its bond - trading , a business that is highly volatile and unpredictable , while its credit card write - offs soared .
And management admitted that it expects further significant write - offs and huge operating losses in its credit card business .
The problem with the credit card debt issue is that it is fast looking like the tail that is wagging the dog , the dog being the U.S. economy .
The banks – not just JPMorgan Chase , but all of those that are in the credit card business — are now , after 15 years of mismanagement of that business , trying to fix it fast and faster .
The mismanagement came in the form of mindlessly and endlessly extending credit to uncreditworthy consumers .
It was fiduciarily irresponsible .
But it was hugely profitable - until the proverbial crud hit the fan .
Today the disastrously managed credit card business threatens to be a major impediment in the economic recovery because the only way the banks can extricate themselves from the mess they have created is literally to shut down the industry .
They may not view it that way , but their customers do .
When you punish your best customers , the ones who pay on time and pay far over the monthly minimum , by ( 1 ) forcing them to pay higher interest rates , despite the lowest interest rates in the country in over fifty years , ( 2 ) increasing their monthly payments ( 3 ) shortening the payment terms and ( 4 ) reducing or even cancelling their credit lines , you are saying you do n’t want to be in the business .
The excuse the banks are using is that the economy is difficult and everyone has to share in the pain .
But who was sharing in the profits for all those years when the business was the most profitable one for the banks ?
Nobody but the banks reaped those rewards .
They should now suffer the losses on their own .
Government involvement in industry is not good for industry or for Government .
But the impact of what the banks are doing to their GOOD customers is so harmful to the economy , that it behooves the Government to open its eyes to it .
It has a responsibility to its constituents .
The economy is a long way from being out of the woods .
Unemployment will continue to rise , and may well reach 10 % .
That means that credit card delinquencies will only get worse , not better .
The solution is NOT to raise rates , but rather to LOWER them .
How can it be good for the economy to lower mortgage rates , and also good for the economy to raise credit card interest rates ?
It is completely counter - intuitive .
More than that , it is disastrous for the economy .
It is equivalent to the debtors ’ prisons of Dickens ’ time .
Consumers :
Tell your story of woe to your representatives in Washington D.C. and in your own State Government .
Make your voice heard , because until then , Government has neither the will nor the interest in facing the issue .

The original emo king , the Herlihy boy house service :
Herlihy Boy :
Hey , look who ’s here !
It ’s nice to see you again , you look great !
Let me sleep in your bed .
Do n’t shake your head “ no ” .
Let me sleep in your bed .
You ’re not even gonna be there .
Please let me sleep in your bed ?
Nothing weird ’s gonna happen .
I ’ll sleep in the exact same position as you sleep .
You can trust me .
I ’ll even wash the sheets before you come back , how ’s that ?
Please ?
Mr. O’Malley : Sweet Mother of God , what is the hold up ?!
Let the boy sleep in your damn bed !
He said he ’d wash your sheets !
The Fermi Gamma - Ray Space Telescope has been orbiting Earth and scanning the sky for high - energy gamma ray photons since last summer , and its first 87 days of observations are now combined into less than four minutes in this time - lapse video .
The video shows a soft blue sky aglow with gamma radiation , punctuated by colorful bursts from bright gamma-ray sources .
Most of the blazes are aptly - named blazars , galaxies with active nuclei that shoot jets of plasma directly at Earth .
Several are pulsars , remnants of dead stars that shine lighthouse - like beams on the sky as they rotate .
Some of them ( like PSR J1836+5925 , singled out in the video ) are gamma - ray–only pulsars , a new class of pulsars discovered by the Fermi telescope .
The constant campfire - like glow at the bottom of the screen is the plane of the
Milky
Way galaxy .
Every so often , a ball of fire seems to fall along an arc from the top right side of the screen to the bottom .
This is our own sun , which gives off gamma radiation nearly a billion times more energetic than visible light when cosmic rays strike its photons .
NASA and the Fermi Large Area Telescope team released a series of time - lapse videos like this one of the twinkly gamma - ray sky .
New Zealanders are to be asked what they would like to call their two main islands , currently North and South .
The country 's Geographic Board , which assigns and approves place name changes , has announced consultations on alternative English and Maori names .
The move follows the discovery that the geographically correct names , used for 200 years , were not legally registered .
The discovery was made by board researchers investigating Maori names for the two islands .
The Geographic Board wants to allow English or Maori names to be used in the future , but this aim is complicated by the fact that competing Maori words exist for each island .
They include Te Ika a Maui ( the fish of Maui ) for the North Island and Te Wai Pounamu ( the waters of greenstone ) for the South Island .
Maui was a mythological Maori demi- god who is said to have caught the fish - shaped North Island while out in his brother 's canoe , the South Island .
Maori names appeared on early maps of New Zealand including charts by Captain James Cook , the British explorer and map - maker who claimed the territory for Britain .
" This is part of our country 's history of European exploration and settlement .
It was only from the 1950s that Maori names stopped appearing on official maps , " said board chairman Dr Don Grant .
A selection of your comments : How about " Not Australia " and " Still Not Australia " ?
Kevin , Austin , Texas
They should be called : " South Island - the best Island " and " North ( not as good as the south ) Island "
Alice , Rugby , UK , from New Zealand
Why can't we just continue to call them North and South and legally register them ?
It does n't matter what you call them : people will continue to refer to them by their existing names .
Mt Egmont is a classic example .
Surely we have better things to worry about as a nation , like winning the 2011 rugby world cup .....
Scott Aitken , Hamilton , New Zealand I am a Kiwi now living in Australia .
Given the climate change and other more pressing issues facing New Zealand and other countries , concerning ourselves with the names of the islands is a complete waste of time .
If " North " and " South " Islands have n't been registered as proper names in the registry , just do it now and let 's get on with finding some answers to real problems .
For a country , which produced people like Lord Rutherford and Edmund Hillary , we should know better than to get side - tracked by form over substance .
Let 's get our priorities right .
Bruce Sivalingam , Perth , Western Australia
I am a New Zealander and I could n't care less what the islands are called .
They have always been the North Island and the South Island in my lifetime , and they always will be .
Like Mount Egmont and Mount Cook .
I have absolutely no issue with places to have official Maori names and English names , but I 'm fairly sure most Kiwis will continue to use the English names in this instance .
Jacq , Letchworth , England Register the names every one is used to and will continue to use : North & South Island .
Another ridiculously pointless debate from New Zealand , with the last one being ' We should change our national flag - let 's make it all black with a Kiwi in the middle .
Even if they get changed , no one is actually going to call them by the new names , so why bother .
Matt , Auckland , New Zealand
Why not " North Island " and " South Island " in Maori ?
Ryan Jorgensen , Auckland , Nz I have heard strong support for NW Christchurch and for SW Auckland
Sven Grammersdorf , Wellington , North Island
Why not pick names from Middle Earth to get the tourist numbers back up ?
Gondor and Mordor ?
Wellington should be changed to Hobbiton , Auckland Rivendell .
The English names are ugly anyway .
Stephen McPhillips , Denmark , from New Zealand I would call them the 51st and the 52nd State of the USA
Bob , Auckland No-one refers to the islands by their names .
It is never " North Island " or " South Island ' , but always " the north island " and " the south island " .
In other words , by popular usage , the islands do not have names as such .
While this will probably prevail , I think we have a golden opportunity here to officially designate the Maori names for the islands .
And while we are about it , let 's also get rid of the absurd name for the country .
Again , the Maori name , Aotearoa , is much more meaningful and attractive .
After that , we can hopefully ditch our embarrassing colonial flag .
Allen Gray , Oamaru , New Zealand
The whole issue of name changing has been trumped up by the New Zealand media .
The names North Island , referring to the Northern Island and the South Island , referring to the southern Island , has worked well for the past one hundred years .
Changing them will only cause confusion and this will also lose New Zealand business money .
New Zealand has gone far too politically correct : this is another way of highlighting this fact , changing these names to Maori will serve no purpose as only a few hundred thousand people worldwide speak this language .
Benedict Xu-Holland , Wellington , New Zealand North and South are a bit bland .
Perhaps we could call the north " Jafaland " , standing for " just another flamin ' Aucklander " and the South " One-eye Country " , because they 're blind in the other .
Or maybe " Dairy " and " Sheep " Islands respectively , to denote the main population .
If we 're going Maori , maybe " Ika " ( fish ) and " Waka " ( canoe ) .
Then one can say the other smells like fish , to which they can reply " go paddle it " .
Point being , no matter what they 're called , the already - ingrained attitudes between one and the other are not going to change .

The Art of Hipgnosis
Aubrey Powell talks about his time with Hipgnosis , his artistic partnership with Storm Thorgerson .
Hipgnosis made innumerable famous album covers , for records such as Pink Floyd 's Animals and Dark Side of the Moon .
He can take it from there :
“ I was waiting for the C , ” he said from his office on West 30th Street , where he works as a proofreader .
“ I ’m an actor  shocker . ”
He said almost everyone seems to be an aspiring actor nowadays , but in this case , it is a critical point to the story : Mr. Lindsey currently appears in an Off Broadway show called “ Kasper Hauser , ” in a role that requires him to repeatedly lift a character who cannot walk .
On Monday , as he waited for the train , about 2:30 p.m. , he was thinking ahead to the reading he was heading to .
“ I ’m kind of zoned out , and I saw this guy come too quickly to the edge , ” he said .
“ He stopped and kind of reeled around .
I felt bad , because I could n’t get close enough to grab his coat .
He fell , and immediately hit his head on the rail and passed out . ”
Mr. Lindsey said he sensed a train was approaching , because the platform was crowded .
“ I dropped my bag and jumped down there .
I tried to wake him up , ” he said .
“ He probably had a massive concussion at that point .
I jumped down there and he just would n’t wake up , and he was bleeding all over the place . ”

Then he went on his way .

He looked back up at the people on the platform .
“ I yelled , ‘ Contact the station agent and call the police ! ’ which I think is hilarious because I do n’t think I ever said ‘ station agent ’ before in my life .
What am I , on ‘ 24 ’ ? ”
Now UPDATED with AUDIO from my final appearance with him during his final hour ( for now ) ...
Brad Friedman Byon 3/20/2009 , 2:46 pm PT
Unfortunately , despite a valiant effort from listeners of the Peter B. Collins
Show earlier this week , Peter tells me that he will indeed be forced to wrap up his show tonight , at least in its current format , as announced last week .
This afternoon , from 3 p - 6 p PT , will be his final syndicated broadcast , and with it , the last of my weekly Friday appearances at 5 pm PT on his show .
( You can listen via this link as we wrap things up today . )
Peter tells me that he plans to return in podcast format --- no official announcements yet as to where and how , on that --- sometime this June .
So we 'll have that to look forward to , at least , even as the people 's airwaves lose one of the nation 's most important progressive voices .
I 'm also informed that Scott Dick , progressive talker , military expert , retired army major and yes , foodie , will be taking PBC 's place for two of the three hours on KRXA 540 am in Monterey , CA , the original flagship station for Peter 's show .
I 've been extended the invitation to continue on as a regular weekly guest on Scott 's show as well , which I hope to work out , and will look forward to .
But , for now , thanks for everything Peter .
It 's been a helluva ride over the last 4 or 5 years .
Oh , the places we 've been ...
POST - SHOW UPDATE :
My final appearance on PBC 's show , during his final hour today , follows , along with the final moments of the hour / his show --- and even a KRXA 540 am ad stuck in the middle , a surprise to me , with Peter B's voice announcing he 'll be a regular weekly guest on Scott Dick 's show , and a plug for my weekly appearances there as well !
( Guess that 's been finalized then ! )
Today I was happy to bring some very good news to the show , as a welcome coda on a whole bunch of the stories PBC and I have covered over the years .
So it 's a good day .
Thanks for the kind words , my friend .
And Happy Trails ...

Blackburn Roversdid something extremely foolish .
Sam Allardyce , who wrote the instruction manual on how to frustrate Arsenal for goodness sake , must have been steaming as he watched his team surrender , and duly get cuffed by Arsène Wenger 's revitalised team .
A flurry of goals – and there should have been many more – pushed Arsenal back into the top four for the first time since the Christmas decorations were up .
The pressure now switches to Aston Villa , while Arsenal relish the feelgood factor .
That was epitomised not only by Andrei Arshavin scoring a pearl of a first goal in English football , but also by the fact Emmanuel Eboué possessed the swagger to insist he should be the man to score from the penalty spot .
Arsenal 's inhibitions are evaporating fast .
For that Wenger felt their Champions League triumph in Rome was a turning point .
" It lifted the spirits , " he said .
" We are playing with freedom again .
We cannot drop off now even one or two per cent in any game , but I feel in the dressing room the team is really up for it . "
What a difference an early strike makes .
Inside three minutes they cured their nil - nilitis with a home league goal to break a 276 - minute barren spell .
Nicklas Bendtner carved the opening , twirling into space and threading a pass for Theo Walcott to cross for Arshavin .
The little Russian 's shot , which was heading wide until it ricocheted off André Ooijer , ensured he celebrated with a blush .
Not so Arsenal 's second , though , which showcased the diamonds in Arshavin 's boots .
He gathered Denilson 's excellent pass , sidestepped Danny Simpson as if he was a training ground cone , and lifted his shot over Paul Robinson from a wafer - thin angle .
It was impressive as he had to have four stitches in his foot at half - time and needed to change into bigger boots .
Although Blackburn demonstrated some niggly habits – with El Hadji Diouf the chief culprit for a reckless kick at Manuel Almunia 's ankle – Morten Gamst Pedersen mustered a couple of counter punches that might have hurt their hosts before half - time .
But Allardyce wrote this one off as " a very bad day " and bemoaned the injury list , which increased as Gaël Givet and Stephen Warnock limped off .
Arsenal created plenty .
Samir Nasri belted a free - kick against the crossbar and was a general nuisance .
The strategy of having three nimble ball players switching positions around target - man Bendtner was promising .
The 21 - year - old was a real handful but miscued when he could have scored a hat - trick .
But he only need look at Eboué , described by the PA announcer as " the Arsenal goal machine " , for inspiration .
The Ivorian has turned around his reputation , and scored twice – one a tap in and then a cracking penalty – to make it three from the last two home games .
It took Arsenal eight Premier League matches before this one to score four goals .
Wenger is convinced their drought is now over .
Arsenal at last look like they mean business .
There are many JRuby libraries that try to make GUI development with Java toolkits easier .
We talked to James Britt of the Monkeybars project .
James ' elevator pitch / elevator explanation of Monkeybars is :
Monkeybars is a JRuby MVC framework that sits on top of Swing .
It does n't wrap Swing per se , but instead presents view logic ( encapsulated in Swing classes ) separate from controller and model logic ( in Ruby ) .
In that sense it exploits the freely available , high - quality WYSIWYG Swing UI design tools while freeing you to develop in Ruby .
Initially extracted from real - world applications , Monkeybars was designed with testing and maintaining large applications in mind .
James explains how Monkeybars handles interaction :
One goal of Monkeybars is to decouple the view and the controller ; a controller should never need a direct reference to a view .
Instead , it uses signals to indirectly inform the view that something should be done .
This makes it much easier to test the controller , since you do not have to worry about the UI .
Monkeybars does n't come with a way to build the actual GUI components , instead it allows to choose the GUI building method .
Monkeybars expects to have classes that represent a Swing UI .
At Happy Camper we almost always use the Netbeans UI editor to draw and compile down the UI objects , then reference them via Ruby code in the application .
In principle you could also use Profligacy , Cherry , or even SwiXML +
Builder , though I 've not seen code that does that .
( Also , see my comment later on about planned additions to Monkeybars and making it easier to write in - line Swing code . )
James explains how developers are using Monkeybars :
Most users of Monkeybars are using it in greenfield JRuby applications , but we know of at least one person who has dropped it into an existing Java application .
Monkeybars is available as both a gem and as a jar .
( And as source code , of course . )
We asked whether it'd be possible to use Monkeybars for GUI scripts inside an existing application :
[..]
In a Java app you can load and execute Ruby code , which could use Monkeybars , or in a Ruby app ( assuming it is run under JRuby ) call Monkeybars when you wanted invoke a GUI .
However , your question got me thinking about tossing up a desktop GUI with code that normally did n't offer one .
For example , while developing a Web app , it might be nice if errors were rendered in a nice GUI rather than in the browser or the terminal .
Turns out it 's really easy to hook Monkeybars into a Ramaze app so that you can render a Swing form when you want one .
Turning this into a nice multi- windowed GUI console app , with hooks for viewing source code and docs , would be an interesting project .
Rawr is a tool that 's useful when developing Monkeybars applications .
James explains rawr :
Rawr is another project that evolved out of real - world needs .
It bundles up your Monkeybars app into an executable jar by providing some useful Rake tasks .
You can also make a Windows .exe file , or a Mac .app .
( We 're working on adding a Linux packager . )
This includes icons , media / content jars , and even compiling your JRuby into classes to help speed up load times .
This is how we package up releases of JotBot , our time - tracking app which we believe is the first commercial JRuby desktop application .
We asked about Monkeybar 's future , post 1.0 :
The core is pretty solid now , and has n't had any significant changes in almost a year .
We have a few large production apps that would be painful to refactor if we made big sweeping changes right now , so we 're probably just going to build off of this foundation instead of changing it .
However , with this stability , there are some " nice to have " features we 're considering .
For example , we 're looking at making it easier to create the Swing UI classes using a custom DSL or builder syntax .
Swing is huge , so we wo n't pretend to try to wrap all of it , but many basic UI forms and components should be more easily available in conventional Ruby syntax .
Given that , we can look at application generators .
Many apps have a set of common forms and behavior : splash screen , system tray icon , help and " about " forms , and so on .
It should be easy for someone to get a minimally functioning desktop app running in a few command line calls or Rake tasks .
The app can then be fleshed out , with additional UI components built using either inline code or compiled Java classes .
Logan has been working on view bindings , which is an easier way to do mapping with your model and view , and making the data seem as if it 's always in sync .
Another project comprises some helpers for common things that we think Swing should be able to do , but currently does n't , or does n't do easily .
For example , being able to disable specific items in a combo box , or context menus for text fields .
Yet another endeavor is getting Cucumber + RSpec to play nice with Monkeybars ; there are some tricky bits down that path .
Finally James provided a list of resources and places to follow Monkeybars development , or ask questions to the Monkeybars core team ( currently James , Logan Barnett , David Koontz ) :
There 's monkeybars.org of course ; we 're in the process of updating docs and screencasts for the 1.0 release .
We 're on IRC at #monkeybars on Freenode , and there 's a Monkeybars Google group , too :
http://groups.google.com/group/monkeybars
Logan Barnett blogs about Monkeybars as well :

There 's the video of David Koontz at RubyConf 2008 :

Martin Slader covered Monkeybars at Ruby Manor : http://rubymanor.org/videos/gui_manor_born/
People can try out a commercial Monkeybars app for themselves by downloading JotBot and a requesting a free trial key :

We 're also starting to move some things to Kenai so that we have a more stable home for user - supported documentation .

What do you use to build GUIs with JRuby ?
Hewlett - Packard confirmed Tuesday that it is testing Google 's Android operating system as a possible alternative to Windows in some of its netbook computers .
Analysts said the move would allow HP to develop a low - cost netbook optimized for wireless networks that provides access to Web - based services such as Google Docs , but others questioned whether the Google software is ready for such a task .
" Right now Android is barely finished for phones , " said Avi Greengart , an analyst at Current Analysis .
While it works well enough for T - Mobile 's G1 smartphone , the software was released only last year and " the UI still feels half - finished , " he said .
HP stressed that it was still only testing Android , an OS based on the open - source Linux kernel .
It has assigned engineers to the task but has made no decision yet whether to offer Android in products , said HP spokeswoman Marlene Somsak .
The news was first reported earlier Tuesday by the Wall Street Journal .
" We want to assess the capability it will have for the computing and communications industry , " Somsak said .
" We remain open to considering various OS options . "
Netbooks are small , low - cost computers that are designed primarily for browsing the Web and doing basic computing tasks .
The category has proved popular -- about 10 million netbooks shipped in 2008 and the number is expected to double this year , according to IDC .
Android was designed for mobile phones but has been seen by some others besides HP as a potential OS for netbooks .
Some enthusiasts have been testing Android on netbooks such as Asustek 's Eee PC , and chip makers such as Qualcomm and Freescale hope to bring Android to netbooks running on their Arm - based chips .
HP may have in mind a netbook optimized for use with Web - based services such as the Google Docs hosted applications suite and Google 's online storage service , said Roger Kay , president of Endpoint Technologies Associates .
The fact that notebooks are designed to provide quick access to online services , often over wireless networks , makes them in some ways like oversized smartphones .
There are also no license fees for Android , which could allow hardware makers to offer lower - priced computers than those running Windows .
However , consumers have been willing to pay extra in the past for netbooks running Windows , analysts noted .
HP already offers some PCs with a choice of Linux or Windows , and introducing another OS choice would come with some risk , said David Daoud , a research manager at IDC .
Some end - users do n't like Linux because they are unfamiliar with it , he said .
" We 've seen a number of netbooks returned as a result of the Linux OS .
Consumers are used to the Microsoft Windows world , " Daoud said .
Linux adoption remains weak on client computers , especially in mature markets like the U.S. and Western Europe , he noted .
Still , there may be an upside for Android if HP were to make it work in netbooks .
HP 's heft as the world 's largest PC maker would widen Android 's use , Daoud said .
It could see success in emerging markets like India and China , where Linux adoption is growing .
But HP would need to deliver a consumer - friendly product that makes Linux easier to use in PCs , Daoud said .
The Phoenix Suns Can Sing !
Total Pro Sports – Even if they Phoenix Suns lost the rest of their games this year and missed the playoffs they would still be one of my favorite teams .
So you ask , Why is that ?
Well the other day they Suns and some of their players were present at a Charity Event and decided to sing for the thousands in attendance .
Performing was Lou Amundson who sang “ Ice Ice Baby ” with Shaquille O’Neal and Alando Tucker as members of his on - stage posse , Goran Dragic sang the theme song from “ Greatest American Hero , Believe it or not ” and Robin Lopez sang the theme song from “ Cheers , Where Everybody Knows Your Name ” .
If it were my choice I would nominate them all for a Grammy .
But the winner of the most outstanding performance goes to Robin Lopez and his fantastic voice .
Get this kid a record deal !!!!!
Enjoy the Music Video .

Apple has just given the world its first look at iPhone 3.0 — an upcoming version of the system software for its smartphone and handheld .
Among the highlights are peer - to - peer gaming and cut , copy , and paste .
Still missing , however , is support for running third - party applications in the background .
The company gave a preview of the next - generation iPhone software to journalists this afternoon .
The first new feature announced was In - App Purchase .
This will allow companies to sell items from within applications .
On - device e-book stores is one example , but developers will also be able to sell additional levels for their games .
Naturally , this will still be tied to the iTunes App Store , and Apple will get 30 % of the revenue .
Next to be announced was peer - to - peer connectivity .
This will allow two iPhones or iPod touches to connect to each other over Bluetooth to play head - to - head games .
Thanks to this upcoming feature , two devices that are near each other and are both running the same game will automatically seek each other out .
While gaming is the most obvious use for this , Apple promised there would be others .
Cut , Copy , and Paste
Confirming the earlier rumors , iPhone 3.0 will — finally — allow iPhone users to cut - and - paste and copy - and - paste .
Naturally , the process for selecting text will take advantage of this device ’s multi - touch screen .
This feature will be available in Apple ’s own software and third - party apps .
And it extends to more than just text .
Users will be able to copy images and paste them into an email .
MMS , A2DP , Etc .
i Phone 3.0 will also mark the arrival of other features long available in the iPhone ’s competitors , including MMS messaging , Stereo Bluetooth , device search , and voice memos .
In addition , landscape support is being added to more of the bundled applications .
Apple is also going to release a new SDK ( software developer kit ) for handling streaming audio and video , including HDTV streaming .
Still No Multitasking
Apple had some good news and bad news for users .
The bad news is that it ’s still not allowing multitasking because running third - party applications in the background is more than the device can handle .
Scott Forstall , Apple SVP iPhone Software , who handled much of today ’s presentation , said that an IM application running in the background reduced the iPhone ’s standby battery time by 80 % .
Instead , the company is promising the launch the push notification service it announced with iPhone 2.0 .
This will allow applications that are n’t running to receive a notification that an event has happened , like an IM message is waiting .
These notifications will be routed through Apple , and will require considerably less power than true multitasking .
Also Missing …
During a question - and - answer session , Apple ’s Forstall was asked about a couple of other long - awaited features that were n’t announced today : a Flash player and tethering .
He declined to talk about the Flash player , fending off the question by pointing out that the iPhone already handles h.264 , the streaming video format used by YouTube for its mobile site .
On the subject of tethering , Forstall said that Apple was working with carriers around around the world to build that feature into the iPhone .
However , he did not get specific on when users will be able to use tether their smartphone to their laptop to share the Internet connection .
New Mapping Options
In addition , thanks to tools that will be released as part of iPhone 3.0 , developers will be for the first time be able create software with maps embedded into it with relative ease .
This API will provide the tools , but developers will have to supply their own maps ; they wo n’t be able to use the proprietary ones that are part of Google Maps .
In addition , Apple will start allowing developers to access the iPhone ’s location information to create navigation software with turn - by - turn directions .
Coming to an iPhone 3G Near You
Apple released a beta of the developers tools today , but iPhone users will have to wait until June to upgrade their device .
It will be available for free for the iPhone 3G and the first - generation iPhone .
However , the original model wo n’t support MMS messages or Stereo Bluetooth .
Users of the iPod touch will also be able to upgrade , but it will cost $ 9.95 .

As I watched the hot , dry winds scream through the bush , sometimes accompanied by rather freaky dust devils that sounded like freight trains approaching , I started to think that maybe I ’ll never be able to establish a vegetable garden on my patch of dirt .
There ’s not many veggies that can withstand heat of up to 48C ( 118 F ) and a week straight of 40C ( 104 F ) + temperatures without a lot of intervention .
Even the drought resistant Gallapagos Tomato seeds that await my action I suspect wo n’t be able to stand the combination of heat , wind and lack of rain that seems to becoming the norm during our summer months .
Up until the beginning of March , we had under 2 mm of rain for the year .. less that a tenth of an inch .
It ’s not so much any particular element , but the combination and extremes we are experiencing that pose the biggest challenge for home veggie growers .
Installing a rainwater tank or rain barrel to keep vegetable gardens going is a great idea as is mulching , but that only addresses a few issues .
After looking a little into Square Foot Gardening recently , it dawned on me that an extension of that is likely the way to go – mobile square foot vegetable gardening .
It ’s not something I ’ve attempted yet , but a highly mobile vegetable garden is an idea I ’m putting out there for perhaps an entrepreneur to act on , making a commercially available , reasonably priced barrow for such a purpose .
Back in my late teens , I used to work in a plant nursery with Azaleas .
We had these huge barrows we used to fill with potted plants to move them between potting areas .
Even though the fully ladened barrows weighed a great deal , they were easy to maneuvre and very robust .
I think that a variation on these barrows may be ideal for growing vegetables , with the added benefit of being fully mobile .
A nursery barrow – could be quite easily
converted to a mobile vegetable garden
with the right trough insert .
A nursery barrow – could be quite easilyconverted to a mobile vegetable gardenwith the right trough insert .
By replacing the wire carrier frame with a sturdy recycled food grade plastic trough of suitable height , this set up could work quite well and applying the principles of square foot gardening , may only take a few barrows to service a family .
Actually , the wire frame could remain in order to give the barrow extended applications .
Freezing in winter ?
Move the barrow to an area of your yard that ’s not so prone to frost , or into a garage for the night
Too hot and dry in summer ?
Move the barrow to a shady spot for the afternoon .
Too windy ?
Shift it to a sheltered area until the wind abates .
Too wet ?
Again , move to a sheltered area during the deluge .
Additionally , the system would use far less water and be much easier on the back and knees when it comes to working the garden .
Accessories could include a drip irrigation system fed by a bolt on water feeder tank , frames for climbers such as peas and beans , framework and covering to create a mini- greenhouse , inserts for growing potatos – there ’s a ton of possibilities .
So , as I mentioned , if you ’re an entrepreneurial soul who can see the value in such a product ; go for it .
If you do create a mobile vegetable garden barrow , be sure to let me know as I may not have gotten around to building mine by then :) .
What are your thoughts vegetable gardeners of the world ?
Do you see the mobile vegetable garden being a good solution ?
Would you buy one ?
What would you add to it or what sort of design changes do you envisage ?
States May Be Getting Ready To Dissolve Our Federal Government
Could this be an ominous shadow drawing on the end of the United States of America ?
For years the Federal Government has presumed to be the all - powerful force governing our country , but it just could be that the Federal Government only exists at the pleasure of the state governments and the citizens thereof .
States declaring sovereignty sounds like an act of secession and revolution .
However the federal government can apparently be dissolved and another one formed anew at the discretion of the states .
The existing Federal government may not leave willingly like so many European governments that are replaced routinely and it may engage a military effort with our own soldiers or the likes of a Black Water illegal military invasion to retain total control over us .
United States Federal Government laws are often in violation of the Tenth Amendment , which is perturbing , these events .
This is predicated on an earlier provision of the Articles of Confederation , which states that , “ Each state retains its sovereignty , freedom , and independence , and every power , jurisdiction , and right , which is not by this Confederation [ now Federation ] expressly delegated to the United States , in Congress assembled . ”
A growing number of states are declaring their sovereignty afforded under the U S Constitution ’s Tenth Amendment however the conventional news media are not telling you about what is happening .
The State of Washington on Wednesday - 11 February 2009 and most recently , New Hampshire [ 2009 ] , Montana [ 2009 ] , Hawaii [ 2009 ] , Michigan [ 2009 ] , Missouri [ 2009 ] , Arizona [ 2008 ] , Oklahoma [ 2008 ] , Georgia [ 1996 ] , and California [ 1994 ] all of which have introduced bills and resolutions declaring and reaffirming their sovereignty .
Some other states have done this in the past but then let the issue go .
Additionally , the states of Colorado , Hawaii , Pennsylvania , Arkansas , Idaho , Indiana , Alaska , Kansas , Alabama , Nevada , Maine , and Illinois are considering similar measures .
More well may follow , such as Wyoming and Mississippi .
The Tenth Amendment of the United States Constitution , which is part of the Bill of Rights , was ratified on December 15 , 1791 and states , “ The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution , nor prohibited by it to the States , are reserved to the States respectively , or to the people . ”
Historically , this was done to reassert the assignment of the remaining rights to the states and the people of our country if they were not specifically delegated by our Constitution to the United States Government .
Further , Amendment Nine on the Construction of the Constitution , Ratified on 15 December 1791 states , “ The enumeration in the Constitution , of certain rights , shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people . ”
The Arizona State Legislature is currently formulating a bill that declares their state sovereignty .
Their bill further asserts their state ’s right during martial law to call back servicemen to protect Arizona state , " … if the President or any other federal entity attempts to institute martial law or its equivalent without an official declaration in one or more of the states without the consent of that state … ”
There is more near the end of this article .
A lot of this recent activity has come about due to the reckless demise of the banking system now and also in memory of the past during the great depression that fomented during 1929 .
There is a Russian academic , Igor Panarin who recently predicted that the United States would break apart into about six separate regions by 2010 .
Predictions of similar persuasion have been made before , rather they are right or not some big problems may soon ensue .
Much of the presidential character of the cabinet assembled by President Obama is representative of that of the previous administration .
Obama perhaps is keeping the Adage , “ keep your friends close and keep your enemies even closer . ”
A disrespect for our so - called leaders is met from our so - called leaders disrespect for us the citizens of our country .
Should this be the case yet again , this would establish further reason for the states course of recent action
It may seem ironic that as we have a President from the land of Lincoln , and one who admires Lincoln , that another civil war could be brewing .
It ’s further ironic that states are beginning to fight back .
Many individuals that were imprisoned by Abraham Lincoln for advocating their free speech on issues of the day .
These times may be as exciting and revolutionary as when our country was beginning .
Benjamin Franklin said something on the order of , “ if we do not hang together , we most certainly will hang separately . ”
Its also ironic that our revolutionary war was with Great Britain and that the so - called Federal Reserve Board ( The Banksters ) is a corporate instrument of Great Britain , still engorging itself with our blood , our wealth and our money .
The state sovereignty issue was discussed on late night radio on Coast - to - Coast AM .
Comments reflected by Alex Jones indicate federal misjurisdiction of its authority that is infringing on state matters and on individual rights .
States formed this federal government and it may be disempowered by 34 states [ 2/3rds ] .
The Federal government may have disenfranchised itself by making treatise that subvert its powers .
As such the Federal government may already be insolvent even though it ’s still operating .
There is mostly Republican , some Democratic and much nonpartisan sponsorship on recreating state sovereignty to resolve these issues .
Take a look at these links : click here and here .
Strings attached by the federal government to returning state money for federal programs may be invalid .
States are rejecting federal intervention .
Issues at hand involve the National Guard , Posse Commentates , and FEMA Prisons for events of rebellion [ or civil demonstration ] and revolution and a reimposition of the concept of establishing a North American Union .
Take a look at Jerome Corsi ’s book , “ The Late Great USA ” .
Federal negation of states ’ rights is selling us out and is treasonous is among the repressive efforts against the states .
States may dissolve this federal government .
An effort in Missouri to push for sovereignty began three years ago when Missouri started to revive interest in its sovereignty .
Other issues are 2nd Amendment Rights being taken away and the institution of civil disobedience , revolution and re-evaluation of where we want our government to go .
Unfunded mandates are forcing issues that the states will block is just one of many issues at hand .
The Federal Government essentially has succeeded from our union .
PDD - 51 , part of The National Security and Homeland Security Presidential Directive , allows for martial law a lot too easily ; this is really not in the best interest of the citizens of the United States .
The negation of Congressional authority by the Executive branch is further ammunition for the states to declare their sovereignty .
Congress has become a ceremonial branch of the government with no real power left .
Congress has just given up its power by not reading the legislation it is being persuaded to pass hurriedly .
Nobody in Congress seems to read the bills they pass .
We must educate ourselves or suffer the consequences for lack of knowledge .
Presidents have become front men for wealthier world powers .
Generally all state resolutions and bills to regain states inherent rights are a perfectly legitimate concept .
While succession could be a possibility , the dissolution of the entire federal government and the institution of a new one predicated mostly on our current one is a distinct possibility .
It has come to the point where the banks are controlling Washington DC [ or , is it the Bilderbergers as part of the new world order ? ] .
Or is it just the old world order they are trying to recreate ?
The use of crises to terrorize us and promote a new world order , based not on what is good for us , but for them !
Any world government that should arise must be democratic and not arbitrary .
Actually , it is still the Old World Order that the new world order advocates guised in the remains of globalism misused .
The primary Constitutional responsibilities of the Federal government are to control our borders , our currency and our military of which they are abdicating on all of these .
Granted there is an enumeration in Article I , Section 8 of our Constitution providing for eighteen or so in total responsibilities and rights .
Clause 18 , considered the expansion or elastic clause states , “ To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers , and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States , or in any Department or Officer thereof . ”
The union is already gone and America has been sold out to foreign banks .
States have the right to dissolve the federal government in order to reconstitute it .
There is a non-democratic globalist effort that is stealthily moving ahead with its plan for a world government and economy made in their image , not ours .
The Constitutional principle in the Tenth Amendment is reflective of Federalism in that by providing that powers not granted to the National government nor prohibited to the states are reserved to the states and to the people .
In the Articles of Confederation , a precursor to our Federal Government today , " Each state retains its sovereignty , freedom , and independence , and every power , jurisdiction , and right , which is not by this Confederation expressly delegated to the United States , in Congress assembled . "
Once our Constitution was ratified , many desired the addition of a similar amendment limiting the Federal government to powers to those " expressly " delegated ; this would have denied the use of implied powers .
These powers result under the Elastic Clause the Constitution .
Those implied powers are powers not given to the government directly through the Constitution , but are considered to be implied in Section Eight of our Constitution .
This document lets the government create Legislation and laws they considered necessary and proper so that they may remain in force , to meet as then or in the future unanticipated applications of the Constitution .
The word " expressly " did not appear in the final version of the Tenth Amendment as it then was ratified .
Some state representatives on late night radio Coast to Coast AM were Matt Shea - WA , Jim Guest - MO , Dan Itse - NH , & Charles Key – OK provided a range of views on this subject .

In response to increasing federal encroachment , a growing number of states have passed and proposed resolutions to assert the Tenth Amendment and the Bill of Rights of the Constitution .
The Declaration Of Independence states : " Governments are instituted among Men , deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed , That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends , it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it , and to institute new Government "
A new vision for America is in the works .
This is not just about state sovereignty , but America ’s Sovereignty .
We will be rebuilding America in the image we want , not what outsiders want .
We are not ending America , but providing it a new beginning .
Here in are some of the resolutions and portions thereof :
A small portion from the resolution in Arizona created in 2009 : “ Be it resolved by the House of Representatives of the State of Arizona , the Senate concurring , that :
1 . That the State of Arizona hereby claims sovereignty under the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States over all powers not otherwise enumerated and granted to the federal government by the Constitution of the United States .
2 . That this Resolution serves as notice and demand to the federal government , as our agent , to cease and desist , effective immediately , mandates that are beyond the scope of these constitutionally delegated powers .
3 . That all compulsory federal legislation that directs states to comply under threat of civil or criminal penalties or sanctions or requires states to pass legislation or lose federal funding be prohibited or repealed . ”
~~~
Each state ’s resolution has some language that is about the same but also has more to say in many cases .
The California Resolution initiated in 1994 reads thusly ,
“ WHEREAS , The 10th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States reads as follows :
" The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution , nor prohibited by it to the States , are reserved to the States respectively , or to the people " ; and
WHEREAS , The 10th Amendment defines the total scope of federal power as being that specifically granted by the United States Constitution and no more ; and
WHEREAS ,
The scope of power defined by the 10th Amendment means that the federal government was created by the states specifically to be an agent of the states ; and
WHEREAS ,
In the year 1994 , the states are demonstrably treated as agents of the federal government ; and
WHEREAS , Numerous resolutions have been forwarded to the federal government by the California Legislature without any response or result from Congress or the federal government ; and
WHEREAS , Many federal mandates are directly in violation of the 10th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States ; and
WHEREAS , The United States Supreme Court has ruled in New York v. United States , 112 S. Ct. 2408 ( 1992 ) , that Congress may not simply commandeer the legislative and regulatory processes of the states ; and
WHEREAS , A number of proposals from previous administrations and some now pending from the present administration and from Congress may further violate the United States Constitution ; now , therefore , be it

Rail enthusiasts can now enjoy views of Scandinavian fjords , the Swiss Alps , and even Mount Rushmore - in Germany .
Twin brothers Frederick and Gerrit Braun have built Europe 's longest model railway in the city of Hamburg .
It has six miles of track , cost £ 8 m to build and its 1,150 square metres ( 12,380 square feet ) take in the US , Scandinavia and the Swiss Alps .
By the time the layout is completed in 2014 it will be twice as long and will take in France , Italy and the UK .
By then it should be the longest miniature railway in the world .
The Braun brothers , 41 , began work on the Miniatur Wunderland project in 2000 .
Their model railway now comprises 700 trains with 10,000 carriages , 900 signals , 2,800 buildings and 160,000 individually designed figures .
It even includes scale models of the Rocky Mountains , Mount Rushmore , the Swiss Matterhorn , and a Scandinavian fjord complete with 4ft cruise ship .
The scenery took 500,000 hours , 700kg of fake grass and 4,000 kg of steel to build .
So large is the layout that 160 staff are employed to show visitors around the railway .
" Our idea was to build a world that men , women , and children can be equally astonished and amazed in , " said Gerrit Braun , according to the Daily Telegraph newspaper .
" With this attitude we managed to create technology which amazes our visitors . "
As winter begins to wind down , we are still in the middle of sled dog racing season .
The Iditarod in Alaska had its ceremonial start in Anchorage last Saturday ( the 7th ) , the Yukon Quest race from Canada 's Yukon Territory to Alaska took place back in mid-February , and the Can - Am Crown races were held in Maine only a couple of weeks ago .
The most well - known of the races , the Iditarod Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race , covers 1,868 km ( 1,161 mi ) , and takes anywhere from 8 to 12 days for mushers and their teams of 16 dogs to complete .
Collected here are several photos from recent sled dog races and training sessions around the Northern Hemisphere .

Designed by Soviet secret - keepers in the depths of the Cold War , Star City lies deep in the pine and birch forests on Moscow ’s edge , and even now you ca n’t find it on many maps .
The men at the gates and checkpoints ask for your documents , and when you get inside the legendary cosmonaut training center , you expect to find something splendid -- a glimmer of the cosmos , a flash of eternal striving .
After all , Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has pumped vast amounts of petrodollars into his grand vision of recapturing the Soviet space program ’s lost glory .
You imagine Star City , then , as a crucial hub of science and progress , the prestigious launching pad for the bright young Russian minds that will drag Moscow back to the forefront of space research .
But the hushed fields and deep woods have an eerie , deserted feel .
Between research buildings , stray dogs pick at frozen mud scabbing the snow .
Here and there , retired engineers in fur - lined hats stroll unsteadily among the buildings of the compound , a cross between a village and an industrial park .
Alexander Belyayev , a slight , steel - haired man in corduroy pants and a turtleneck sweater , will show you around .
The former instructor has a crushing whiskey hangover , he explains apologetically .
He keeps ducking outside for a smoke .

As soon as you arrive , Belyayev starts riffling through papers in a plastic briefcase , tugging out an invoice .
No , you say .
That ’s not for me .
We do n’t pay for stories .
Oh , that is not yours , anyway , Belyayev says as he wrinkles his brow .
That was for the journalists who came yesterday .
He slips it back inside , flushes , and digs out another sheet of paper .
Give it to the photographer , you say , not wanting to touch it , feeling a little embarrassed as fabulously rich Russia squeezes foreign reporters for cash .
There had been months of negotiations .
At first , the administration demanded $ 500 for the privilege of visiting Star City .
Finally , officials agreed that the visit would be free but that the photographer had to pay $ 250 to shoot pictures of the cosmonauts training .

And so Belyayev marches you and the photographer into a cavernous , shiny hall where gaping windows frame a winter sky .
The model spaceships look smaller and older than you expected , like huge , steel - tinted eggs , elevated on platforms and interspersed with thick clumps of houseplants .
In front of a bank of control panels and computers , two middle - aged women discuss methods of cooking potatoes and sausages .
There are some men too , one of them in camouflage .
Except for the cosmonauts in their bright blue jumpsuits , you ca n’t tell what any of them are doing , and you are not supposed to ask .
As for the cosmonauts , they stoically ignore you -- presumably they are used to being put on display as they clamber up and down the ladders leading to the spaceship hatches , doff their shoes and climb inside to study the controls .
There are American astronauts training here too , but the Russians forbid you to talk with them as well .

“ Do n’t take pictures of the Americans ! ” Belyayev snaps .
He prods you up the ladder to peer into a model spaceship , where a lone cosmonaut is at the controls , pretending to guide a spaceship to dock at the International Space Station .
“ Take off your shoes , ” Belyayev hisses .
“ And do n’t talk to cosmonauts . ”
“ What ’s his name ? ” asks the photographer .
“ Just write ‘ Russian cosmonaut , ’ ” Belyayev says .
“ We ’re not allowed to publicize his name until he flies into space . ”

In another pod , a white - haired instructor lectures his trainees , manual in hand .
“ You should n’t always trust U.S. indicators at the station , ” he tells them .
“ Why ? ” one of the young trainees interjects .
“ Because we think our equipment is more precise . ”
Watching them from the bottom of the ladder , Belyayev smiles nostalgically .
“ Many , many years the cosmonauts sit inside these small [ spaces ] and train many , many times , ” he says .

Yuri Baturin is the only cosmonaut authorized to speak with reporters .
He has cotton - white hair , tinted glasses and the calm presence of a man who , after two voyages into space , has lost the capacity to worry over details .
You ask him about the Russian program and prepare yourself for exuberance .
Instead , Baturin pauses and sighs .
“ This is a very difficult and painful question , because it ’s not very proper to criticize your own government , especially in a foreign newspaper , ” he says .
“ But our politicians who talk about the space program do n’t understand a thing about it .
I state today that Russia does not have a real space program . ”
You remember when you ’d just gotten to Moscow and your Russian - language teacher mentioned Yuri Gagarin .
She stared , stupefied , at your blank face , as if contemplating whether she could teach her language to a cretin who did n’t recognize the name of the first man to soar into space .
Advertisement
And now here you are , eyeball to eyeball with an heir to Gagarin ’s heroic legacy , and the more he talks , the more disappointed he sounds .
“ Our space agency for several years is not calling the tender for a new ship , ” he says .
“ They do n’t know what for and where to fly . ”
And : “ The politicians do n’t understand the complexity of the task .
They announce Russia will land on Mars by 2030 , which creates the illusion that Russia has a mission to Mars . . . [ but ] the government should not just try to be the first to put a flag on Mars . ”
Finally : “ Space tourism is only harmful to the Russian space program , in my opinion .
In the corridors here you can find dozens of cosmonauts who would have accompanied a flight in the past seven years but did n’t because their seat was occupied by a tourist .
It leads us into a dead end . ”
Advertisement
In the end , Baturin gives you a glossy photograph of himself , and a book he compiled , and walks you out of his office .
Later , you ’ll try to figure out whether what he said was true : whether , behind the screen of extravagant political statements , high - rolling space tourism junkets and U.S. dependence on Russia for lifts to the space station , there is a vacuum of purpose and projects .
You ask around , and others agree .
“ Unfortunately , we ca n’t say right now that Russia has a powerful space program , ” Igor Marinin , editor in chief of Space News magazine , says when you call .
“ For a very long time we simply lived on the verge of extinction . ”
Meanwhile , Belyayev bustles you into a room to see a model of Mir , the space station that was decommissioned and sent crashing into the South Pacific in pieces in 2001 after 15 years in orbit .
There are dummies in spacesuits , and grainy photographs of astronauts and cosmonauts aboard the space station .
Belyayev snickers when he points out the space toilet .
The room is musty smelling , and holes gape in the tiled floor .
Then he takes you back over the snow to a building that houses the pool where cosmonauts practice moving around without gravity .
But nobody is training today , and so you stare silently through a glass panel at murky water .
Advertisement
Everybody , Belyayev says slyly , wants to see the big centrifuge .
This is where cosmonauts prepare to experience the physical sensations of G - force during liftoff .
Schoolchildren on a field trip are also being promised a view of the centrifuge .
They tramp up one flight of stairs after the next , excited at the notion of seeing a man being spun furiously .
You follow them .
At the top of the stairs there is a window set into a wall ; an adult has to lean over to get a glimpse .
The window looks out over the centrifuge .
It is a big contraption built of metal .
It ’s not moving ; it ’s not doing anything .
There are no people inside .
One by one , the children turn away with fallen faces , and troop back down the stairs .
You pause , and realize that nobody is coming to open any more doors , let alone perform any centrifugal feats .
Then you follow the children down .

BERN , Switzerland ( AP ) 
The Swiss government said Sunday it will not attend a U.S. Senate hearing on tax havens — an apparent protest against a U.S. lawsuit aimed at forcing banking giant UBS AG to hand over data on tens of thousands of American customers .
Switzerland declined an invitation to the March 4 hearing by the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations , Finance Ministry spokesman Roland Meier said .
The Internal Revenue Service is seeking to force UBS to turn over records for an estimated 52,000 U.S. customers who allegedly violated American tax laws by concealing Swiss accounts worth at least $ 14.8 billion .
The IRS lawsuit filed in Miami came only hours after UBS agreed Wednesday to pay $ 780 million and disclose up to 300 UBS account holders suspected of tax fraud , in a deal with the U.S. Justice Department .
" Switzerland notes that despite the agreement , U.S. authorities have launched a civil lawsuit against UBS , " Meier said .
" Switzerland regrets that the Department of Justice has threatened UBS with unilateral measures , despite cooperation of UBS and Swiss authorities with the U.S. authorities . "
The topic of the March 4 hearing is " Tax haven banks and U.S. tax compliance — obtaining the names of U.S. clients with Swiss accounts . "
Swiss financial authorities have acknowledged that the disclosure of up to 300 suspected tax frauders occurred under intense pressure from the U.S. Justice Department .
The move prompted anger in Switzerland at UBS ' business practices and what many saw as heavy - handed treatment by U.S. authorities .
It also sparked a nationwide debate over the country 's cherished banking secrecy , which some said they fear might come to an end .
The banking industry has helped transform Switzerland into one of the world 's richest countries .

What the People of Seattle Know About Lobsters , Hoboes , and Con Games
John Hodgman is the author of The Areas of My Expertise , which he read from to a live audience on November 17 at Elliott Bay Book Company .
This is his review of that audience .
Before our reading in Seattle , Jonathan Coulton and I were told to not expect too many laughs .
" Seattle is an earnest city , " our friends from Seattle told us as we all stood in the basement of Elliott Bay , a warm , windowless chamber lined with books , perfect for a reading or a bibliophilic ritual murder .
" It is a very sincere city , " our friends went on , and as evidence they produced a third friend , named Pam , who just that afternoon had received a $ 47 ticket for jaywalking , even though she was visibly , precipitously pregnant .
Pam nodded solemnly .
It was true .
It would be difficult to predict how my book — a plotless , wry compendium of lies , invented history , and fake trivia — would go over in a town so devoted to the social contract .
Never mind our various live antics .
Jonathan , in his buckskin shirt and coonskin cap , looked spooked .
An old friend and a former Whiffenpoof , Jonathan had gamely followed me from town to town , playing guitar as I read about the nine U.S. presidents who had hooks for hands , for example , and the secret history of the hoboes .
But we had just come from San Francisco , where the crowds had been very sparse , very quiet , and very earnest , and this had left us bloodless and shaken .
Our foolproof bit about the history of the lobster in America ( they were , as you know , first released in Central Park in 1890 ) had provoked only confused smiles and slowly blinking , glassy eyes .
In describing the famous streetside con game known as " three - card monte , " I realized that the San Franciscans had no idea what I was talking about .
" Is it , " I had asked , " that you in San Francisco never deceive one another ? "
Someone in the back nodded proudly .
Now in Seattle , the first to arrive was a small woman with long , wild , gray hair .
She was wearing a fiercely pilled fleece zipper vest ( purple ) and a white painter 's hat dotted with pins protesting a variety of obscure ballot referenda .
She was a good 10 minutes early .
I explained this to her , but she said , " That 's okay , I 'm just saving a seat . "
BUT DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND ?
I wanted to scream .
NO ONE IS COMING !
But Seattleites are not inclined to wait , I gather , for a gigantic man quickly followed her , in thick black - rimmed glasses and sweatpants and timberland boots .
He sat down and began silently , unwaveringly staring at me , as he would for the entire hour .
Soon thereafter , he was joined by a lively and generous handful of early arriving strangers who did not look like they were going to kill us .
And cheered by this , we began .
We talked about the U.S. presidents .
As usual , people were less inclined to believe that Martin Van Buren 's nickname " Old Kinderhook " is where the term " OK " comes from ( which is true ) than to believe that they called him that because he had a hook for a hand ( which is not true ) .
But this is common enough , so we went on nervously to the lobsters , and as Jonathan sang his ode to the Furry Old Lobster * , suddenly we were getting laughs .
Granted many of these were from the woman with wild , gray hair , whose theatrically loud guffaws seemed to emanate randomly from the back without connection to any jokes I was telling .
But they were , in any case , real laughs , and either the guy with the off - brand mp3 player around his neck had very bad allergies , or he was actually in tears .
Emboldened , we went on to the Q&A , which we typically conduct via walkie - talkie .
A gentleman named Myron called from the first row to ask a few questions about hoboes .
A nice fellow , but I could see them coming from 1,000 yards off .
( Q : Did I have a hobo nickname ?
A : " Non-Hobo John Hodgman . " )
Another nice fellow stumped me with sincere questions about what it was like to be associated with McSweeney 's and to be on the Daily Show ( A : both were surreally dizzying , proud - making ; only one provided a gift bag packed with Altoids ) .
The Seattleites enjoy the two - part questions , I realized .
The woman with the wild , gray hair in the back at first refused to speak via walkie - talkie .
" I DO NOT KNOW HOW TO USE THIS TECHNOLOGY ! " she proclaimed very loudly , as if we were really separated by great distance .
But then she relented , and asked what does " Hodg - man " mean , and I called swiftly on my third - grade genealogy project to respond " one who tends a hedge . "
INEXPLICABLE GUFFAW !
( The gigantic man remained silent of course , but I did notice that he was tapping his massive , Timberlanded toes when Jonathan went into the hobo anthem " The Big Rock Candy Mountain . " )
Afterward , as we were doing the signing , the woman with the wild , gray hair asked me if I liked Jonathan Swift , not even waiting for the answer before cackling her way out of the room .
She did n't buy a book .
But that was fine : Apparently the Seattleites are just crazy or pregnant or gigantic or plain sweet enough to get it .
And if I required further proof , it came the next day , when we addressed a group of employees and die - hard Jonathan Coulton fans at Amazon .
" I do n't suppose you know the three - card monte , do you ? " and the room broke out into knowing laughter .
Jonathan and I sighed .
The people of Seattle know about the con game , that 's for sure , and did n't even mind our own , and for that we were relieved and grateful .
The Justice Department announced yesterday that the CIA had destroyed 92 videotapes from the agency ’s interrogations of high - ranking captured Al Qaeda suspects .
In the case of one , Abu Zubaydah , that should not be surprising , because as one American intelligence source has told me , what Zubaydah says on those tapes is the “ Rosetta Stone ” of what really happened behind the 9/11 terror attacks .
In a short monologue that one investigator told me was the “ Rosetta Stone ” of 9/11 , Zubaydah laid out details of how he and the al Qaeda hierarchy had been supported at high levels inside the Saudi and Pakistan governments .
In my 2003 book , Why America Slept : The Failure to Prevent 9/11 , I set forth how Zubaydah initially refused to help his American captors .
I also disclosed how US intelligence established a " fake flag " operation , in which the wounded Zubaydah was transferred to Afghanistan under the ruse that he had actually been turned over to the Saudis .
The Saudis had him on a wanted list , and the Americans believed that Zubaydah , fearful of torture and death at the hands of the Saudis , would start talking when confronted by US agents playing the role of Saudi intelligence officers .
But when confronted by his " Saudi " interrogators , Zubaydah showed no fear .
Instead , according to the two US intelligence sources that provided me the details , he seemed relieved .
The man who had been reluctant to even confirm his identity to his US captors suddenly talked animatedly .
He was happy to see them , he said , because he feared the Americans would kill him .
He then asked his interrogators to call a senior member of the Saudi royal family .
And Zubaydah provided a private home number and a cellphone number from memory .
" He will tell you what to do , " Zubaydah assured them
That man was Prince Ahmed bin Salman bin Abdul - Aziz , one of King Fahd 's nephews , and the chairman of the largest Saudi publishing empire .
Later , American investigators would determine that Prince Ahmed had been in the US on 9/11 .
American interrogators used painkillers to induce Zubaydah to talk — they gave him the meds when he cooperated , and withdrew them when he was quiet .
They also utilized a thiopental sodium drip ( a so - called truth serum ) .
Several hours after he first fingered Prince Ahmed , his captors challenged the information , and said that since he had disparaged the Saudi royal family , he would be executed .
It was at that point that some of the secrets of 9/11 came pouring out .
In a short monologue that one investigator told me was the " Rosetta Stone " of 9/11 , Zubaydah laid out details of how he and the al Qaeda hierarchy had been supported at high levels inside the Saudi and Pakistan governments .
He named two other Saudi princes , and also the chief of Pakistan 's air force , as his major contacts .
Moreover , he stunned his interrogators by charging that two of the men , the king 's nephew and the Pakistani air - force chief , knew a major terror operation was planned for America on 9/11 .
It would be nice to further investigate the men named by Zubaydah , but that is not possible .
All four identified by Zubaydah are now dead .
As for the three Saudi princes , the king 's 43 - year - old nephew , Prince Ahmed , died of either a heart attack or blood clot , depending on which report you believe , after having liposuction in Riyadh 's top hospital .
The second , 41 - year - old Prince Sultan bin Faisal bin Turki al - Saud , died the following day in a one - car accident , on his way to the funeral of Prince Ahmed .
And one week later , the third Saudi prince named by Zubaydah , 25 - year - old Prince Fahd bin Turki bin Saud al - Kabir , died , according to the Saudi Royal Court , " of thirst . "
The head of Pakistan 's air force , Mushaf Ali Mir , was the last to go .
He died , together with his wife and 15 of his top aides , when his plane blew up — suspected as sabotage — in February 2003 .
Pakistan 's investigation of the explosion — if one was even done — has never been made public .
Zubaydah is the only top al Queda operative who has secretly linked two of America 's closest allies in the war on terror — Saudi Arabia and Pakistan — to the 9/11 attacks .
George W. Bush protected the Saudi royal family and the Pakistani military from the implications of Zubaydah 's confessions .
Bush , because of getting bogged down in Iraq , desperately needed Pakistani and Saudi help .
He wanted them to keep Afghanistan from spinning completely out of control , and act as counterweights to the growing power of Iran .
The Sunni governments in Riyadh and Islamabad have as much to fear from a resurgent Iran as does any American administration .
But that accommodation meant that the leads about the origins of 9/11 were not pursued .
I hoped that President Obama would not be so craven as President Bush in chasing the truth about 9/11 , no matter where it leads .
Now , with the destruction of the tapes , his intelligence advisers will tell him there was no such thing as the Zubaydah confession .
The American public deserves no less than the complete truth about 9/11 .
And those CIA officials complicit in hiding the truth by destroying key evidence should be held responsible .
President Obama is our last chance .

San Francisco Bay View
April 11 , 2009 San Francisco Bay ViewApril 11 , 2009
Who imagined that in 2009 , the world ’s governments would be declaring a new War on Pirates ?
As you read this , the British Royal Navy – backed by the ships of more than two dozen nations , from the U.S. to China – is sailing into Somalian waters to take on men we still picture as parrot - on - the - shoulder pantomime villains .
They will soon be fighting Somalian ships and even chasing the pirates onto land , into one of the most broken countries on earth .
In the “ golden age of piracy ” — from 1650 to 1730 — the idea of the pirate as the senseless , savage thief that lingers today was created by the British government in a great propaganda heave .
But behind the arrr- me - hearties oddness of this tale , there is an untold scandal .
The people our governments are labeling as “ one of the great menaces of our times ” have an extraordinary story to tell – and some justice on their side .
Pirates have never been quite who we think they are .
In the “ golden age of piracy ” – from 1650 to 1730 – the idea of the pirate as the senseless , savage thief that lingers today was created by the British government in a great propaganda heave .
Many ordinary people believed it was false : Pirates were often rescued from the gallows by supportive crowds .
Why ?
What did they see that we can’t ?
In his book “ Villains of All Nations , ” the historian Marcus Rediker pores through the evidence to find out .
If you became a merchant or navy sailor then – plucked from the docks of London ’s East End , young and hungry – you ended up in a floating wooden Hell .
You worked all hours on a cramped , half - starved ship , and if you slacked off for a second , the all - powerful captain would whip you with the cat o’ nine tails .
If you slacked consistently , you could be thrown overboard .
And at the end of months or years of this , you were often cheated of your wages .
Pirates were the first people to rebel against this world .
They mutinied against their tyrannical captains – and created a different way of working on the seas .
Once they had a ship , the pirates elected their captains , and made all their decisions collectively .
They shared their bounty out in what Rediker calls “ one of the most egalitarian plans for the disposition of resources to be found anywhere in the 18th century . ”
They even took in escaped African slaves and lived with them as equals .
The pirates showed “ quite clearly – and subversively – that ships did not have to be run in the brutal and oppressive ways of the merchant service and the Royal navy . ”
This is why they were popular , despite being unproductive thieves .
The words of one pirate from that lost age – a young British man called William Scott – should echo into this new age of piracy .
Just before he was hanged in Charleston , South Carolina , he said : “ What I did was to keep me from perishing .
I was forced to go a -pirating to live . ”
In 1991 , the government of Somalia – in the Horn of Africa – collapsed .
Its 9 million people have been teetering on starvation ever since – and many of the ugliest forces in the Western world have seen this as a great opportunity to steal the country ’s food supply and dump our nuclear waste in their seas .
In a surreal telephone interview , one of the pirate leaders , Sugule Ali , said their motive was “ to stop illegal fishing and dumping in our waters …
We do n’t consider ourselves sea bandits .
We consider sea bandits [ to be ] those who illegally fish and dump in our seas and dump waste in our seas and carry weapons in our seas . ”
Yes : nuclear waste .
As soon as the government was gone , mysterious European ships started appearing off the coast of Somalia , dumping vast barrels into the ocean .
The coastal population began to sicken .
At first they suffered strange rashes , nausea and malformed babies .
Then , after the 2005 tsunami , hundreds of the dumped and leaking barrels washed up on shore .
People began to suffer from radiation sickness , and more than 300 died .
Ahmedou Ould - Abdallah , the U.N. envoy to Somalia , tells me : “ Somebody is dumping nuclear material here .
There is also lead and heavy metals such as cadmium and mercury – you name it . ”
Much of it can be traced back to European hospitals and factories , who seem to be passing it on to the Italian mafia to “ dispose ” of cheaply .
When I asked Ould - Abdallah what European governments were doing about it , he said with a sigh : “ Nothing .
There has been no cleanup , no compensation and no prevention . ”
At the same time , other European ships have been looting Somalia ’s seas of their greatest resource : seafood .
We have destroyed our own fish stocks by over - exploitation – and now we have moved on to theirs .
More than $ 300 million worth of tuna , shrimp , lobster and other sea life is being stolen every year by vast trawlers illegally sailing into Somalia ’s unprotected seas .
The local fishermen have suddenly lost their livelihoods , and they are starving .
Mohammed Hussein , a fisherman in the town of Marka 100 km south of Mogadishu , told Reuters : “ If nothing is done , there soon wo n’t be much fish left in our coastal waters . ”
This is the context in which the men we are calling “ pirates ” have emerged .
Everyone agrees they were ordinary Somalian fishermen who at first took speedboats to try to dissuade the dumpers and trawlers , or at least wage a “ tax ” on them .
They call themselves the Volunteer Coast Guard of Somalia – and it ’s not hard to see why .
In a surreal telephone interview , one of the pirate leaders , Sugule Ali , said their motive was “ to stop illegal fishing and dumping in our waters …
We do n’t consider ourselves sea bandits .
We consider sea bandits [ to be ] those who illegally fish and dump in our seas and dump waste in our seas and carry weapons in our seas . ”
William Scott would understand those words .
[ efoods ]
No , this does n’t make hostage - taking justifiable , and yes , some are clearly just gangsters – especially those who have held up World Food Program supplies .
But the “ pirates ” have the overwhelming support of the local population for a reason .
The independent Somalian news site WardherNews conducted the best research we have into what ordinary Somalis are thinking – and it found 70 percent “ strongly supported the piracy as a form of national defense of the country ’s territorial waters . ”
During the revolutionary war in America , George Washington and America ’s founding fathers paid pirates to protect America ’s territorial waters , because they had no navy or coast guard of their own .
Most Americans supported them .
Is this so different ?
Did we expect starving Somalians to stand passively on their beaches , paddling in our nuclear waste , and watch us snatch their fish to eat in restaurants in London and Paris and Rome ?
We did n’t act on those crimes – but when some of the fishermen responded by disrupting the transit corridor for 20 percent of the world ’s oil supply , we begin to shriek about “ evil . ”
If we really want to deal with piracy , we need to stop its root cause – our crimes – before we send in the gunboats to root out Somalia ’s criminals .
The story of the 2009 war on piracy was best summarized by another pirate , who lived and died in the fourth century BC .
He was captured and brought to Alexander the Great , who demanded to know “ what he meant by keeping possession of the sea . ”
The pirate smiled and responded : “ What you mean by seizing the whole earth ; but because I do it with a petty ship , I am called a robber , while you , who do it with a great fleet , are called emperor . ”
Once again , our great imperial fleets sail in today – but who is the robber ?
Postscript : Some commentators seem bemused by the fact that both toxic dumping and the theft of fish are happening in the same place – would n’t this make the fish contaminated ?
In fact , Somalia ’s coastline is vast , stretching 3,300 km ( over 2,000 miles ) .
Imagine how easy it would be – without any coast guard or army – to steal fish from Florida and dump nuclear waste on California , and you get the idea .
These events are happening in different places but with the same horrible effect : death for the locals and stirred - up piracy .
There ’s no contradiction .

Caravans of cash - rich Chinese in Hummers and Lincoln Navigators have been weaving through American neighborhoods in recent months , looking for foreclosures and other bargain properties to buy .
With housing prices crashing in the U.S. , home - buying trips to America are becoming one of the more popular tour group packages in China .
New U.S. visa rules for Chinese tourists and a loosening of foreign investment policies by China have made it easier for people such as Zhao Hongjun of Beijing to go house hunting across the Pacific .
The 48 - year - old owner of a media company went on a two - week road trip through the U.S. last fall , visiting scenic sites and checking out properties from Los Angeles to New York .
He ’s been following the swoon in prices ever since , and next month he ’s considering joining another prospecting group that is heading for San Francisco , Los Angeles and Las Vegas , three of the hardest - hit housing markets in the U.S .
Zhao ’s budget : $ 1 million .

“ L.A. is not bad ; a lot of Chinese live there , ” he said , noting that he was interested in both apartments and houses .
The tours are a new twist on an old phenomenon .
Overseas Chinese have been buying Southern California properties for years .
What ’s different now is that they are starting to do it in large groups and quite openly .
“ Before , it was kind of private , a quiet thing among friends , ” said Jamie Lee , a Chinese American who runs the Los Angeles Convention and Visitors Bureau office in Beijing .
“ Now it ’s full - blown . . . .
It ’s huge . ”
Some of these groups “ are talking about going every two weeks . ”

Chinese home - buying missions in the U.S. are part of a broader trend of individuals and businesses in China seeking greater investment opportunities abroad .
This week government and business officials from China ’s southern Guangdong province will arrive in Los Angeles to create a regional chamber office .
Certainly , a wave of Chinese bottom fishers wo n’t end the housing woes in Southern California , where by some measures the median price has sunk more than 40 % since the spring and summer of 2007 .
But it could help rev up sales in some places , including the UC Riverside area and the San Gabriel Valley , home to large Chinese American communities and mentioned by some potential buyers as places of interest .
Ling Chow , president of the San Gabriel - based Chinese American Real Estate Professionals Assn. , says brokers and agents welcome the mainland tours -- anything to shake the doldrums of the market crash .

But Chow , who mostly serves mainland Chinese buyers , is more skeptical about any new wave of Chinese home buyers making a significant imprint .
Unless they ’re willing to spend more than $ 400,000 , they ’ll probably be disappointed in the available homes .
Chinese are culturally inclined to buy new homes and prefer high - achieving school districts , demands that drive up prices .
Chow said Chinese buyers ’ affinity for paying in cash will benefit them during the credit crunch .
Many of her mainland clients have paid with cash , often for mansions and condos in Arcadia , where they can begin the immigration process or leave their college - age children to live alone .
The Chinese do have a lot of cash to spend .
The central government holds the biggest stockpile of foreign reserves in the world , nearly $ 2 trillion , most of it in dollars .
And the Boston Consulting Group estimates that there were more than 391,000 millionaire households in mainland China last year , up from 310,000 reported the previous year .
Still , Beijing has been cautious about outward investment , given the uncertainties of the financial crisis and heavy losses that its sovereign wealth fund has sustained buying stakes in American financial institutions such as investment bank Morgan Stanley .
In addition , China ’s economic growth has slowed sharply in recent months as the nation ’s exporters have been hurt by slumping U.S. demand , and China ’s own real estate market has been sluggish .
Advertisement
But home prices in the U.S. have fallen more sharply than in China , and many Chinese consider the American market highly alluring as a place to invest and live because of the United States ’ developed economy .
The purchasing tours in the U.S. grew out of similar trips by well - heeled Chinese back home .
Investors from Wenzhou and other entrepreneurial hot spots were known for chartering buses to visit such cities as Shanghai to shop for apartments .
Now some of them are signing up with outfits like Soufun.com , the real estate website that is sponsoring the home - buying trip next month from Beijing to California and Nevada .
Liu Jian , chief operating officer at Soufun Holdings , said his group ’s tour would focus on homes priced between $ 200,000 and $ 300,000 , just at or below the median for Southern California .
More than 300 people have registered for the trip , which could last 10 days and cost each person about $ 2,200 , excluding airfare .

“ Many of them want to buy because they have actual needs to live there or for their children , ” Liu said .
“ They will hold the property for quite a long period . ”
James Chou of Coldwell Banker George Realty in Alhambra said he was preparing for several groups from China early next year , totaling up to 200 people .
His firm will provide hotels and tour buses .
Chou said the potential investors were keen to see foreclosed homes , but he warned that it would be difficult to educate them about the home - buying process in such a short time .
He said they had little understanding of single - family houses , coming from a country where most people live in urban apartments .
“ I do n’t think they know much about the market here , ” Chou said .

Lee , of the L.A. Convention and Visitors Bureau , has mixed feelings about these gou fang tuan , Chinese for home - buying groups .
On one hand , she says , they will be staying and eating and shopping in Los Angeles , pumping dollars into the local economy .
On the other hand , Lee has been working hard in China to publicize the biggest attractions of Los Angeles : its great weather , beaches , Hollywood and theme parks .
“ I ’m promoting tourism to L.A. , but not to go to buy cheap houses , ” she said .
“ Are we that desperate ? ”
Mei Xinyu is ambivalent for a different reason .
As a researcher for China ’s Ministry of Commerce , Mei does n’t want to see a rush of Chinese buying homes in the U.S. and getting burned .

“ The housing price right now in the U.S. is fairly low already , but it ’s hard to say how long it will remain in the valley , ” he said .
Chinese investors , Mei added , should be careful to study the markets before plunging into them .
In some places , they could face a backlash , just as there was when the Japanese went on a shopping spree in the U.S. during the 1980s .
What ’s more , he warned , some American cities may not bounce back at all .
“ China is still in the process of urbanization .
It ’s unlikely to turn into ghost towns , ” he said .
“ But the U.S. is different . ”
Yuan Lixin says his group ’s tour to the U.S. is meant to address precisely that concern -- to give visitors a deeper understanding of the real life of America over 14 days , before they buy into the real estate .

“ What we sell is the culture , American culture , ” said Yuan , a planning department official at Beijing Youth , a newspaper enterprise that has organized group tours to the U.S. since late 2006 .
The tours did n’t start out as home - buying trips , but while driving across the continent in luxurious SUVs , people could n’t help but take notice of “ For Sale ” signs outside houses , including those that appeared to be empty , Yuan said .
“ In many cases , members would stop the car and actively ask about the house situation , ” he said .
“ Now because of the financial crisis , ordinary people in China also are starting to make large purchases in the U.S. , ” Yuan said .
“ In the past , people who traveled to the U.S. might carry back a large luggage with American goods .
It ’s just that this time , what they bring back are [ papers showing ] hundreds of thousands of dollars of a house . ”

I LOVED this game when I was a kid , but as I did n't have a Beeb or a Speccy , like my mates , I could n't play it on my own .

ONAIZA , Saudi Arabia , April 12 ( UPI ) --
A Saudi Arabian judge has refused to overturn a ruling that declared the arranged marriage of an 8 - year - old girl to a 47 - year - old man legal , a relative says .
The judge , Sheikh Habib Habib , ruled for the second time Saturday in Onaiza that the girl 's marriage to a friend of her father 's was legal and binding .
He said the child wife could file for divorce once she reached puberty , CNN reported .

An unnamed relative of the girl told the broadcaster that Habib , who first refused to annul the marriage last year , reconsidered the case upon the girl 's mother 's appeal .
The mother 's attorney , Abdullah Jutaili , said the girl 's father arranged the marriage with his " close friend " to pay off a monetary debt .
The relative said the girl 's mother , who is divorced from the father , will continue to seek to overturn the marriage .
An appeals court in Riyadh will reportedly consider the case again in a hearing set for next month .
Zuhair Harithi of the Saudi Human Rights Commission told CNN child marriages in the country must be fought , saying they " violate international agreements that have been signed by Saudi Arabia and should not be allowed . "
The documents reveal interesting details of how Microsoft grades the performance of hardware and what has changed in the new Experience Index for Windows 7 .
It is especially interesting to see what they consider " good enough " performance for Windows 7 .
Kevin Kelly linked to a paper " co-authored by mathematician John Conway , inventor of a cellular automata demonstration known as the Game of Life , [ who ] argues that you can't explain the spin or decay of particles by randomness , nor are they determined , so free will is the only option left . "
From the paper ( The Strong Free Will Theorem ) :
Some readers may object to our use of the term " free will " to describe the indeterminism of particle responses .
Our provocative ascription of free will to elementary particles is deliberate , since our theorem asserts that if experimenters have a certain freedom , then particles have exactly the same kind of freedom .
Indeed , it is natural to suppose that this latter freedom is the ultimate explanation of our own .
Particles Have Free Will
Obama 's Wall Street cabinet
By Tom Eley and Barry Grey
6 April 2009
A series of articles published over the weekend , based on financial disclosure reports released by the Obama administration last Friday concerning top White House officials , documents the extent to which the administration , in both its personnel and policies , is a political instrument of Wall Street .
Policies that are extraordinarily favorable to the financial elite that were put in place over the past month by the Obama administration have fed a surge in share values on Wall Street .
These include the scheme to use hundreds of billions of dollars in public funds to pay hedge funds to buy up the banks ’ toxic assets at inflated prices , the Auto Task Force ’s rejection of the recovery plans of Chrysler and General Motors and its demand for even more brutal layoffs , wage cuts and attacks on workers ’ health benefits and pensions , and the decision by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) to weaken “ mark - to - market ” accounting rules and permit banks to inflate the value of their toxic assets .
At the same time , Obama has campaigned against restrictions on bonuses paid to executives at insurance giant American International Group ( AIG ) and other bailed - out firms , and repeatedly assured Wall Street that he will slash social spending , including Medicare , Medicaid and Social Security .
The new financial disclosures reveal that top Obama advisors directly involved in setting these policies have received millions from Wall Street firms , including those that have received huge taxpayer bailouts .
The case of Lawrence Summers , director of the National Economic Council and Obama ’s top economic adviser , highlights the politically incestuous character of relations between the Obama administration and the American financial elite .
Last year , Summers pocketed $ 5 million as a managing director of D.E.
Shaw , one of the biggest hedge funds in the world , and another $ 2.7 million for speeches delivered to Wall Street firms that have received government bailout money .
This includes $ 45,000 from Citigroup and $ 67,500 each from JPMorgan Chase and the now - liquidated Lehman Brothers .
For a speech to Goldman Sachs executives , Summers walked away with $ 135,000 .
This is substantially more than double the earnings for an entire year of high - seniority auto workers , who have been pilloried by the Obama administration and the media for their supposedly exorbitant and “ unsustainable ” wages .
Alluding diplomatically to the flagrant conflict of interest revealed by these disclosures , the New York Times noted on Saturday : “ Mr. Summers , the director of the National Economic Council , wields important influence over Mr. Obama ’s policy decisions for the troubled financial industry , including firms from which he recently received payments . ”
Summers was a leading advocate of banking deregulation .
As treasury secretary in the second Clinton administration , he oversaw the lifting of basic financial regulations dating from the 1930s .
The Times article notes that among his current responsibilities is deciding “ whether — and how — to tighten regulation of hedge funds . ”
Summers is not an exception .
He is rather typical of the Wall Street insiders who comprise a cabinet and White House team that is filled with multi-millionaires , presided over by a president who parlayed his own political career into a multi-million - dollar fortune .
Michael Froman , deputy national security adviser for international economic affairs , worked for Citigroup and received more than $ 7.4 million from the bank from January of 2008 until he entered the Obama administration this year .
This included a $ 2.25 million year - end bonus handed him this past January , within weeks of his joining the Obama administration .
Citigroup has thus far been the beneficiary of $ 45 billion in cash and over $ 300 billion in government guarantees of its bad debts .
David Axelrod , the Obama campaign ’s top strategist and now senior adviser to the president , was paid $ 1.55 million last year from two consulting firms he controls .
He has agreed to buyouts that will garner him another $ 3 million over the next five years .
His disclosure claims personal assets of between $ 7 and $ 10 million .
Obama ’s deputy national security adviser , Thomas E. Donilon , was paid $ 3.9 million by a Washington law firm whose major clients include Citigroup , Goldman Sachs and the private equity firm Apollo Management .
Louis Caldera , director of the White House Military Office , made $ 227,155 last year from IndyMac Bancorp , the California bank that heavily promoted subprime mortgages .
It collapsed last summer and was placed under federal receivership .
The presence of multi-millionaire Wall Street insiders extends to second - and third - tier positions in the Obama administration as well .
David Stevens , who has been tapped by Obama to head the Federal Housing Administration , is the president and chief operating officer of Long and Foster Cos. , a real estate brokerage firm .
From 1999 to 2005 , Stevens served as a top executive for Freddie Mac , the federally - backed mortgage lending giant that was bailed out and seized by federal regulators in September .
Neal Wolin , Obama ’s selection for deputy counsel to the president for economic policy , is a top executive at the insurance giant Hartford Financial Services , where his salary was $ 4.5 million .
Obama ’s Auto Task Force has as its top advisers two investment bankers with a long resume in corporate downsizing and asset - stripping .
It is not new for leading figures from finance to be named to high posts in a US administration .
However , there has traditionally been an effort to demonstrate a degree of independence from Wall Street in the selection of cabinet officials and high - ranking presidential aides , often through the appointment of figures from academia or the public sector .
In previous decades , moreover , representatives of the corporate elite were more likely to come from industry than from finance .
In the Obama administration such considerations have largely been abandoned .
This will not come as a surprise to those who critically followed Obama ’s election campaign .
While he postured before the electorate as a critic of the war in Iraq and a quasi- populist force for “ change , ” he was from the first heavily dependent on the financial and political backing of powerful financiers in Chicago .
Banks , hedge funds and other financial firms lavishly backed his presidential bid , giving him considerably more than they gave to his Republican opponent , Senator John McCain .
Alongside Wall Street , the Obama cabinet is dominated by the military , including three recently retired four - star military officers : former Marine General James Jones as national security adviser ; Admiral Dennis Blair as director of national intelligence , and former Army Chief of Staff Erik Shinseki as secretary of veterans ’ affairs .
These are the deeply reactionary political and class interests that are represented by the Obama administration .
Friday ’s financial disclosures further expose the bankruptcy of American democracy .
Elections have no real effect on government policy , which is determined by the interests of the financial aristocracy that dominates both political parties .
The working class can fight for its own interests — for jobs , decent living standards , health care , education , housing and an end to war — only through a break with the two parties of American capitalism and the development of a mass , independent socialist movement .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Mumia Abu - Jamal sits on Pennsylvania 's death row , perhaps the most recognized of the 228 condemned inmates at the Greene Correctional Facility , an hour south of Pittsburgh .
Former radio host and convicted cop-killer Mumia Abu - Jamal during a 1994 interview
Abu - Jamal , inmate AM8335 , awaits three milestones .
His new book , " Jailhouse Lawyers , " will be released next month .
He 's also awaiting a pair of Supreme Court decisions , which could come in the next two weeks .
The former Black Panther was sentenced to die for gunning down a Philadelphia police officer 28 years ago .
The high court will decide whether he deserves a new hearing to determine whether his execution should go forward .
The state is appealing a federal appeals court ruling on the sentencing question that went in Abu - Jamal 's favor last year .
The case has attracted international attention .
Abu - Jamal 's lawyers filed a separate appeal claiming that racism led to his 1982 conviction .
That petition is scheduled for consideration by the Supreme Court on April 3 .
If either case is accepted by the justices for review , oral arguments would be held in the fall .
The former radio reporter and cab driver has been a divisive figure , with many prominent supporters arguing that racism pervaded his trial .
Others counter that Abu - Jamal is using his skin color to escape responsibility for his actions .
They say he has divided the community for years with his provocative writing and activism .
He was convicted for the December 9 , 1981 , murder of officer Daniel Faulkner , 25 , in Philadelphia .
Faulkner had pulled over Abu - Jamal 's brother in a late - night traffic stop .
Witnesses said Abu - Jamal , who was nearby , ran over and shot the police officer in the back and in the head .
Abu - Jamal , once known as Wesley Cook , was also wounded in the confrontation and later admitted to the killing , according to other witnesses ' testimony .
Abu - Jamal is black , and the police officer was white .
Incarcerated for nearly three decades , Abu - Jamal has been an active critic of the criminal justice system .
On a Web site created by friends to promote his release , the prisoner - turned - author writes about his fight .
" This is the story of law learned , not in the ivory towers of multi-billion dollar endowed universities but in the bowels of the slave - ship , in the hidden , dank dungeons of America . "
His chief defense attorney , Robert Bryan , has filed appeals asking for a new criminal trial .
" The central issue in this case is racism in jury selection , " he wrote to supporters last month .
" We are in an epic struggle in which his life hangs in the balance .
What occurs now in the Supreme Court will determine whether Mumia will have a new jury trial or die at the hands of the executioner , " Bryan said .
Ten whites and two blacks made up the original jury panel that sentenced him to death .
A three - judge panel of the 3rd Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals kept the murder conviction in place a year ago but ordered a new capital sentencing hearing .
" The jury instructions and the verdict form created a reasonable likelihood that the jury believed it was precluded from finding a mitigating circumstance that had not been unanimously agreed upon , " Chief Judge Anthony J. Scirica wrote in the 77 - page opinion .
The federal appeals court ultimately concluded that the jury was improperly instructed on how to weigh " mitigating factors " offered by the defense that might have kept Abu - Jamal off death row .
Pennsylvania law at the time said jurors did not have to unanimously agree on a mitigating circumstance , such as the fact that Abu - Jamal had no prior criminal record .
Months before that ruling , oral arguments on the issue were contentious .
Faulkner 's widow and Abu - Jamal 's brother attended , and demonstrations on both sides were held outside the courtroom in downtown Philadelphia .
If the Supreme Court refuses now to intervene on the sentencing issue , the city 's prosecutor would have to decide within six months whether to conduct a new death penalty sentencing hearing or allow Abu - Jamal to spend the rest of his life in state prison .
Many prominent groups and individuals , including singer Harry Belafonte , the NAACP and the European Parliament , are cited on his Web site as supporters .
Prosecutors have insisted that Abu - Jamal pay the price for his crimes and have aggressively resisted efforts to take him off death row for Faulkner 's murder .
" This assassination has been made a circus by those people in the world and this city who believe falsely that Mumia Abu - Jamal is some kind of a folk hero , " Philadelphia District Attorney Lynne Abraham said last year , when the federal appeals court upheld the conviction .
" He is nothing short of an assassin . "
The city has honored the fallen police officer with a street designation and a commemorative plaque placed at the spot where he was shot and killed .
The officer 's widow , Maureen Faulkner , wrote a book two years ago about her husband and the case : " Murdered by Mumia : A Life Sentence of Loss , Pain and Injustice . "
She writes that she was trying to " definitively lay out the case against Mumia Abu - Jamal and those who've elevated him to the status of political prisoner . "

ANALYSIS / OPINION :
President Obama ’s pick to head the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration raises a few red flags .
If confirmed by the Senate , Chuck Hurley , CEO of Mothers Against Drunk Driving , will drive motorists over the cliff with regulation .
The nation ’s traffic - safety czar has broad powers to control the roads and road - going habits of Americans .
Mr. Hurley has a history of pushing laws that harass millions of law - abiding citizens to ensnare a few lawbreakers .
He supports returning the 55 mph speed limit to our highways as well as roadblocks and random pullovers to make sure drivers are n’t doing anything wrong .
This methodology is based on a presumption of guilt - not innocence - of the average driver who is doing nothing wrong .
Mr. Hurley has promoted a mania of overregulation at MADD .
Absent from his advocacies is the principle that a punishment should fit the crime , or that a crime even needs to be committed to incur a penalty .
Under this influence , MADD has been lobbying to lower the allowable blood - alcohol content ( BAC ) for drivers to .04 - which means one glass of Pinot can land anyone behind bars .
We do not condone drinking and driving , but the constant lowering of BAC limits has separated what is punishable from what is actually dangerous .
As a result of MADD - fueled binges for tougher laws , extreme drunken driving punishments - such as loss of driving privileges , jail time , fines and legal fees beyond $ 10,000 - often apply to individuals who were not drunk and in some cases were not even driving .
Last month , the Connecticut Supreme Court unanimously upheld a driving - under - the - influence conviction against a man who was sleeping off his bender in his car even though the keys were not in the ignition .
In 2005 , the North Carolina Court of Appeals upheld a DUI sentence for a tipsy man riding a motorized skateboard .
The Georgia State Police charged a woman with drunken driving for riding a horse .
Such absurd cases will continue to proliferate as long as the breathalyzer machine is the sole determinant of guilt rather than evidence of unsafe conduct .
Machines are prone to error , and basing guilt on a digital reading leaves little room for the specific facts of an individual situation .
The same reliance on machines can be seen in Mr. Hurley ’s obsession with red- light and speed cameras .
Mr. Hurley is a former board member of the National Campaign to Stop Red Light Running .
The innocuous - sounding outfit frequently testifies at congressional hearings as if it were a nonprofit victim ’s advocacy group .
In reality , it is a well - heeled lobbying shop for big business .
The so - called National Campaign ’s phone number - ( 202 ) 828-9100 - is answered by a receptionist at the public - relations firm Blakey and Agnew .
Among that firm ’s big - ticket clients are the traffic - camera companies Redflex Traffic Systems of Australia , Gastometer BV of the Netherlands and Lasercraft Inc. of Britain .
These foreign corporations all seek to rewrite state laws to allow machines to issue traffic - camera tickets , thus reaping huge profits for the companies that operate them - including Redflex , Gastometer and Lasercraft .
The position of NHTSA chief requires an administrator of sound judgment , not a zealot beholden to special interests .
Mr. Hurley ’s associations and background raise the specter that he could use NHTSA regulations and safety grants to benefit his friends and coerce states into adopting his overbearing pet policies .
Mr. Hurley should be offered one ( but only one ) for the road and sent on his way .

Work to repair a statue of the footballing legend Brian Clough will cost almost £ 20,000 .
The 7 ft - high bronze figure was erected in May 2007 at Albert Park in the late manager 's home town of Middlesbrough .
But park officials noticed a fatigue fracture on its right leg , which mirrored Clough 's 1962 ligament injury .
Repairs to the statue are to be carried out by a specialist firm in Surrey at a cost of £ 19,000 .
The work is expected to take up to 10 weeks .
The statue has been protected behind temporary fencing while an investigation into the extent and cause of the fracture was carried out .
It is thought the crack may have been caused by children swinging on the leg .
Long - term solution
Paul Thompson , Middlesbrough Council 's executive member for Streetscene Services , said : " Cloughie 's unfortunate injury has forced him onto the sideline for some time now .
" However it was important that we find the right long - term solution to ensure his long - term future . "
The statue , sculpted by Vivien Mallock , shows a 24 - year - old Clough with his boots slung over his shoulder striding towards Ayresome Park , Middlesbrough 's former ground , on his way to training .
He began his playing career at Middlesbrough , later playing for neighbouring Sunderland , and went on to score 251 goals in 274 games for the two North East clubs .
Later he led Derby County and Nottingham Forest to league championships and won two European Cups with the Nottingham club in 1979 and 1980 .
The former player and manager , awarded an OBE in 1991 , died of cancer in September 2004 , aged 69 .
White House cancels mortgage fraudster 's pardon Nick Cargo
Published : Wednesday December 24 , 2008
Print This Email This
The much - criticized pardon of Isaac Toussie has been rescinded , according to the White House in a Wednesday statement :
Yesterday the President forwarded to the Pardon Attorney a Master Warrant of Clemency including 19 requests for pardons with direction that he execute and deliver grants of clemency to the named individuals .
With respect to the case of Mr. Isaac R. Toussie , the Counsel to the President reviewed the application and believed , based on the information known to him at the time , that it was a meritorious application .
He so advised the President , who accepted the recommendation .
Based on information that has subsequently come to light , the President has directed the Pardon Attorney not to execute and deliver a Grant of Clemency to Mr. Toussie .
The Pardon Attorney has not provided a recommendation on Mr. Toussies case because it was filed less than five years from completion of his sentence .
The President believes that the Pardon Attorney should have an opportunity to review this case before a decision on clemency is made .
Toussie , the 30 - year - old son of New York real estate developer Robert , was among 19 pardons in a pre-Christmas round of clemencies granted by President Bush this week .
He defrauded the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development out of millions of dollars and pled guilty to falsifying the incomes of at least 100 families , sometimes without their knowledge , to help them get federal loans .
He was sentenced to five months in prison and five months ' house arrest in 2003 , along with a $ 10,000 fine , but escaped having to pay restitution .
Robert and Isaac Toussie were sued in 2001 in what was called the largest real estate discrimination lawsuit ever filed in New York .
The suit , filed on behalf of 400 families , charged that the Toussies co-conspired with over a dozen lenders to defraud minority homebuyers .
It said that the defendants showed " callous and reckless disregard for the rights of plaintiffs " in using a " pattern of racial and national - origin discrimination ... involving predatory lending and the discriminatory and predatory marketing and sale of residential real property . "
White House counsel Fred Fielding originally reviewed Toussie 's application for pardon and recommended it be granted , but " new information " coming to light overnight , including the nature of the crimes committed and $ 28,500 in donations to the Republican Party made by Robert Toussie , as RAW STORY recently discovered in campaign finance records .
According to spokesperson Dana Perino , neither the White House , nor the President , were aware at the time of review of said donations , which " might create an appearance of impropriety . "
The accompanying video report was broadcast on CNN on December 24 , 2008 :
The electric system at mid-century will have a lot more renewable energy than it does today , but coal and nuclear power together will still supply two - thirds of the energy , according to a new study from the Electric Power Research Institute , a consortium supported by both government - and investor - owned utilities .
Coal - fired plants will likely be capturing and storing their carbon dioxide — so - called “ clean coal ” — and the exact mix between coal and nuclear will depend on construction and carbon sequestration costs , according to the study .
Wind and biomass , meanwhile , will supply about a quarter of the electricity , while solar power will not play a significant role , the study predicts .
“ It just does n’t enter into our equation , ” said Revis W. James , the director of the institute ’s Energy Technology Assessment Center .
Of course , as the physicist Niels Bohr famously observed , “ Prediction is very difficult , especially about the future . ”
Last year the Energy Department produced a report that said that wind alone could produce 20 percent of the country ’s energy by 2030 .
And various advocates say a substantial share could come from solar photovoltaic cells , which make electricity directly from light , or solar thermal systems , which gather the sun ’s heat to boil water .
Geothermal energy and energy from ocean waves or temperature differences are also candidates .
But wind and biomass are the only ones likely to have a cost low enough to compete — at least in the near term , Mr. James said .
The institute is pushing for a broad research program to lower the costs of carbon capture and of low - carbon energy production , and has published two reports — one on where costs stand now , and another on how the mix would vary under various cost levels for carbon storage and for reactor construction .
One way that power plants are compared is by price per kilowatt of generating capacity — roughly the amount needed to run a window air - conditioner .
For nuclear power , the institute has been using $ 4,000 a kilowatt , but Mr. James noted that Moody ’s , the debt - rating agency , recently predicted $ 6,000 .
At the lower construction price , the cost per kilowatt - hour ( the amount that the window air - conditioner would consume running for an hour on a hot day ) is about 6.4 cents .
At the higher price it is 9.4 cents .
( For comparison , in 2007 the average generating cost for the United States was 6.6 cents . )
But $ 6,000 a kilowatt is hardly a ceiling .
The institute notes that some reactors built in the 1980s came in even higher .
So the study also models the results at $ 8,700 a kilowatt of capacity , which would mean 12.2 cents a kilowatt - hour .
For coal , the cost to sequester carbon dioxide is likely to be determined by the number of places approved for underground storage of that compound — and how much it would cost to build a pipeline to pump the material to those sites .
Costs could be lower if the carbon dioxide could be sold to oil producers , who already use it for oil production ( they pump it underground in old oil fields to force out oil that cannot be recovered by conventional means ) .
But , said Mr. James , that financial advantage might not be around very long because the volumes carbon dioxide from power plants would be so large they would quickly depress the market .
And , of course , the relative competitiveness of any future energy resource will depend on another uncertain factor :
How much it will cost to emit carbon dioxide into the atmosphere .
Congress will soon consider putting a cap on emissions and making industries buy the right to emit , but the dollar price that would result from any particular cap are highly uncertain .
Employment in health care , the only major industry outside the federal government still adding jobs , is succumbing to the recession .
In the latest sign , the president of New York City Health & Hospitals Corp. wrote Friday to community organizations as well as employees and unions at its 11 hospitals and four nursing homes , saying the agency will lay off more workers even after slashing 400 jobs last month .

Mozilla ’s web browser Firefox 3.0 crawled past Microsoft ’s Internet Explorer 7 in European market share for the first time last week .
According to StatCounter ’s latest report on browser popularity , Firefox 3 eked ahead of IE 7 in Europe by just one per cent when version numbers were broken down in the market share study .
It found that Firefox 3 pulled in 35 per cent compared to IE 7 ’s 34 per cent market share .
Microsoft ’s IE 7 is currently its most popular browser in the increasingly crowded marketplace .
Users also still run its earlier IE 6 version , as well as the company ’s most recent release - IE 8 - which appears to have helped skew the results in favour of Firefox 3.0 over the past week .
IE 8 currently accounts for 2.3 per cent of total market share in Europe following its mid-March release , which explains the slight blip in IE 7 ’s stats .
StatCounter CEO Aodhan Cullen agreed .
" The move is partly explained by a small switch from IE 7.0 usage to IE 8.0 but also by growing market share overall by Firefox 3.0 , " he said .
However , more significantly : " The data shows that Firefox is closing the gap and is now just 10 percent behind all IE versions in Europe , " according to Cullen .
StatCounter , which based its stats on aggregate data from their own network of users , said IE 's total European market share remained at the top of the pile , accounting for 48 per cent usage , while combined versions of Firefox pull in 38 per cent of web surfers .
Opera is the third most popular browser with seven per cent share in the region , while Apple 's Safari and Google 's Chrome both rank below three per cent take - up . ®
Raw Story :
Determined to enforce the party line , the GOP has taken new steps to punish those members who have crossed the aisle in recent weeks to vote in support of the federal stimulus package and to send the message to any party moderates – turncoats will not be tolerated .
In a Monday interview with Fox News ’ Neil Cavuto , Republican National Committee Chair Michael Steele said he was open to primary challenges to the three Republican senators who voted in favor of the federal stimulus package – Arlen Spector of Pennsylvania and the two senators from Maine , Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe .
Spector is up for re-election in 2010 .
“ My retribution is the retribution of the voters in their state .
They ’re going to have to go through a primary in their state , ” Steele said , adding that the RNC would follow the lead of the state parties in choosing which Republicans to back with campaign money .
“ When the state party says we ’re going to endorse a candidate , the RNC is behind them .
When the state party says we have a problem with them , so does the RNC . ”
More …
What in the world are they thinking ??
This is n’t a game .
This country is in serious trouble – no thanks to the disastrous attempts at governing by the GOP .
We are all Americans , and now is the time to work together for the good of this country – to try and SAVE this country .
Is Michael Steele and the rest of the GOP missing this ?
Do they have ANY clue whatsoever how the lives of Americans ( not Republicans or Democrats , but AMERICANS ) are being affected by this terrible crisis RIGHT NOW ?
We are headed straight down , and there is no change in the direction of that line on the graph yet .
They should change their name .
Really .
The PFS Party .
( Pretty F*** ing Stupid ) , or PDS ( Pretty Damned Shameful ) .
Or , how about this : OTWO … ( On Their Way Out ) .
This is petty politics at its absolute worst ..
I would like to take a second and acknowledge the courageous actions of the three Republican Senators in voting for the Stimulus Bill .
Thank you Senators Spector , Snowe and Collins .
It took a real courage of your convictions to go against the ‘ party line ’ and instead vote for what was needed no desperately now – what was best for all Americans and the good of the country .
Thank you .
Oh , and by the way , I am going to put in another plug for an EXCELLENT book by Thom Hartmann called “ Screwed – The Undeclared War on the Middle Class “ .
It is a MUST READ !
I ca n’t believe how much I am learning , and how much it is putting things in perspective for me .
Thank you Thom Hartmann .

NASA 's Galaxy Evolution Explorer captured this ultraviolet image of the nearby planetary nebula NGC 3242 , also called " Jupiter 's Ghost " ( blue and white region at centre ) .
It may sit as little as 1400 light years away in the constellation Hydra .
As sun - like stars run out of fuel , they swell into red giants .
These bloated stars jettison their outer layers of gas , eventually exposing a dense core of carbon and oxygen called a white dwarf .
The ultraviolet light released by the white dwarfs lights up the surrounding gas , creating planetary nebulae .
Although sun- like stars live for billions of years , planetary nebulae only last some 10,000 years .
Astronomers are not sure whether the wispy white cloud that curves around the blue nebula is a chance passerby or gas that was ejected while the star was still a red giant .

Organic molecules mixed with dust glow green in this infrared image of M33 captured by the Spitzer Space Telescope .
M33 , also called the Triangulum Galaxy , sits some 2.9 million light years away from Earth .
The spiral is a member of the Milky Way 's Local Group , a band of dozens of galaxies that travel as an ensemble because they are gravitationally bound .
Star - forming regions appear orange - red in this image .
Cool material , possibly carried outwards by winds from giant stars or supernovae , glows at infrared wavelengths beyond what optical telescopes detect as the galaxy 's edge .

The ultra - dense remains of a massive star light up surrounding gas and dust to create what appears to be a cosmic hand .
This pulsar , seen in bright blue at the base of the " palm " , is called B1509 .
The star is so dense that the electrons and protons in its atoms have combined to form neutrons .
B1509 spins some 7 times a second and measures just 19 kilometres in diameter .
The magnetic field at its surface is 15 trillion times stronger than the Earth 's magnetic field .
The field drives a wind of electrons and charged atoms that illuminates finger - like structures that extend north .
The pulsar 's reach extends to a neighbouring gas cloud called RCW 89 , where the wind lights up knots of gas , making them glow brightly in X - rays ( visible in orange and red in the upper - right ) .
The temperature in the cloud seems to vary in a circular pattern , which could mean the pulsar is precessing like a spinning top .
B1509 sits some 17,000 light years away from Earth , and is estimated to be about 1700 years old .

This trio of galaxies , which together form a system called Arp 274 , seem to be heading toward a cosmic collision .
In fact , the two large spirals ( middle and right ) already seem to be entangled .
But their proximity is just an illusion – the galaxies lie at different distances from Earth and are far enough from one another that astronomers do not think they interact .
Two foreground stars in the Milky Way can also be seen on the right .
All three galaxies show colourful evidence of new star formation .

A stellar nursery is not uniformly bright , a fact highlighted by this image of NGC 3582 , a nebula that sits some 10,000 light years away in the constellation Carina .
Here , dark dust clouds share space with glowing gas that is energised by the ultraviolet light of young stars .
Wispy structures in the clouds are created by radiation from these young stars , as well as by the explosions of short - lived , massive neighbours .

A nascent bar sits at the centre of NGC 3359 , a delicate spiral galaxy that sits some 49 million light years away in the constellation Ursa Major .
Bars are elongated , rectangular bodies of stars , gas and dust that are often seen in spiral galaxies , though it is not yet clear how they fit into galaxies ' evolution .
Although NGC 3359 is several billion years old , this bar seems to be just 500 million years old .
The galaxy 's arms are dotted with light - red patches , hydrogen - rich regions that are sites of intense star formation , similar to those seen in the Orion Nebula in the Milky Way .
This image was taken by the Gemini North telescope on Mauna Kea in Hawaii .

The chaotic structure of the spiral galaxy NGC 7793 makes it difficult to identify individual spiral arms , though it is possible to discern some rotation .
NGC 7793 sits some 12.5 million light years away from Earth .
It is one of the brightest members of the Sculptor Group , a cluster of galaxies that is one of the closest neighbours to our Local Group of galaxies .

Bachs Musical Revolution by Anno Hellenbroich
This speech opened the second panel of the conference ,  On the Subject of Startegic Method , in Bad Schwalbach , Germany on May 28 , 2000 .
Footnotes have been added .
In his 1680  Rules for the Promotion of the Sciences ,  Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz wrote an idea , to which he attached a metaphor which would seem funny to us today , an idea which is now more important than ever :
 Those who walk around in the sun , take on a different color , and so likewise will a musician , having observed in the compositions of capable people thousands upon thousands of beautiful cadences and , so to speak , phrases of music , will , thus equipped with this beautiful material , be himself enabled to inspire his own imagination . 
And , as a good teacher , who does not want to discourage those who are willing to learn , Leibniz adds :
 There are even such people who are musicians by nature , and compose beautiful melodies . 
To recognize something in the observation of thousands of musical phrases  which inspires ones own imagination .
This is the Classical - humanist method of teaching , which challenges those who are willing to learn to re-live , from the sources of great compositions , the discovery for themselves , whether these be discoveries in the natural sciences , or new artistic creations .
Johann Sebastian Bach ( 1685 - 1750 ) did exactly that when he was a child , and he became a genius .
Mozart and Beethoven wrote down new counterpoint phrases  from the works of their predecessors , but especially from those of Bach , in order to make the new musical idea ,  or thought - object ,  their very own , as LaRouche described it in his groundbreaking essay ,  Mozarts 1782 - 1786 Revolution in Music ,  in 1992.1
As it seems , it is only today , 250 years after Bachs death , that we are better able to understand the musical revolutions which Mozart and Beethoven recognized in Bachs late works , especially in A Musical Offering ( 1747 ) , and in The Art of the Fugue .
Many of the ideas which Leibniz , some forty years earlier , articulated in his late work The Monadology and in Principles of Reason in Nature , and Grace , can help to make Bachs way of thinking , of composing , more intelligible today .
We can obtain a deeper insight into Bachs intellectual principles of composition , which so fundamentally revolutionized Classical thinking , from remarks which Leibniz made with respect to music : his comparison to the principles of construction in nature , the divine order of creation , and the lawfulness of musical harmony .
In his Principles of Reason , for example , Leibniz speaks about the growing joy in the knowledge of the perfection of the universe God created , the same joy which arises from the beauty of a musical work of art , which sounds harmonic :
Since
God is the most perfect and the happiest , and consequently the most worthy of love of all substances , and since truly pure love consists in an emotional condition which allows of the perception of desire for the perfection and happiness of that which one loves , this love gives us the greatest desire of which one can be capable , as soon as God is its object .
Thus do we take joy in music , although its beauty seemingly only consist in the concord of numbers and in counting of which we are not conscious of the waves and vibrations of sounding bodies , which take on certain intervals .
In order to avoid misunderstanding : Leibniz seesas did Kepler and Nicolaus of Cusa before him in numbers and counting , a characteristic of the cosmos ordered by God , a measuring , an aspect of a fundamental lawfulness which characterizes us and our universe .
In particular , Leibniz makes the important remark that music pleases us by means of the concord of numbers and counting , of which we are not conscious . 
Is Leibniz speaking about our souls , perhaps as the midwife of Reason , in which beauty is unconsciously perceived ?
An idea which ( Friedrich Schiller develops in his essay on the aesthetic education of the beautiful soul . )

An idea which ( Friedrich Schiller develops in his essay on the aesthetic education of the beautiful soul . )
In another passage of the Principles of Reason , Leibniz formulates the principle of  the best of all possible worlds  in the following way :
It follows from the highest perfection of God that , when he created the universe , He selected the best possible plan , in which there was the greatest multiplicity in the framework of the greatest order , in which space , position , and time are best employed , so that He achieved the greatest effect with the simplest of means , endowing the creatures with the greatest power , the highest knowledge , the greatest happiness and the greatest good , of which the universe was capable .
 Greatest multiplicity in the framework of the greatest order :
Is not the immense work of Johann Sebastian Bachs life permeated by this principle ?
 Greatest multiplicity in the framework of the greatest order :
Is not the immense work of Johann Sebastian Bachs life permeated by this principle ?
Bach wrote all of his works to God alone the glory ,  soli Deo gloria , hundreds of spiritual and secular Lieder , cantatas , motets , the powerful Passions and the large fugal works , and , not least , the later work with the royal theme , A Musical Offering , as a painful and tedious work . 
Each of his works attests to the attempt to generate the largest multiplicity in a unity , a perfection , to create the greatest effect by employment of the simplest means .
Bachs development of polyphony , the fugue , his use of the organ point , are noticeable elements of this principle of the greatest effect with the simplest means .
That is why we concern ourselves with Classical music , from the Augustinian tradition to Leonardo da Vincis researches on the bel canto human voice , to Bachs revolutionary invention of the well - tempered system because we are convinced of the fundamental intelligibility of creative thinking .
For , both in researches in the physical - natural sciences , as well as in investigating our powers of thinking , our creative thinking processes in the forming of works of art , we run up against the paradox today more than ever : lawful development versus discontinuity which we have to solve .
Bach : Master of Song
It took a long time for Bachs actually magnificent discovery of the characteristics of the six species of the human voice [ See Figure 1 ] for example , in choral singing and in the choral passages of the Passions to be adequately appreciated .
Today , we have to rediscover the characteristics of hearing and singing of Bachs time , the heritage of the Bach family extending over six generations , about which Bachs great son , Carl Philipp Emanuel , reports .
I want to provide one example to illustrate this , in the brief form of this introduction to our panel .
In the second part of the great St. Matthew Passion , which was probably first performed in 1727 ( rediscovered and performed anew 100 years later by the young Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy in Berlin ) , Bach composes a recitativo for the alto voice and two alto oboes ( Oboe da Caccia in F ) ,  Ach Golgatha ,  which represents a prelude to a magnificent alto aria .
These two alto solos are situated following the scene of the crucifixion of Jesus , before Jesus dies on the cross .
 Ach Golgatha reflects the great paradox for all Christians , as expressed in the text of the aria , which says :   Twas there the Lord of glory was vilely rejected ,  and it peaks in the cry of agony ,  ... the innocent must die , as do the guilty .
Ah! how this grief afflicts my soul !
The aria that follows , placed at this prominently dramatic passage of the Passion , takes up the idea of salvation (  See ye , see the Saviors outstretched Hands !/
He would draw us to Himself .
Come . ) .
Compositionally , the aria echoes the interjected calls , which one can hear in the introductory double chorus of the St. Matthew Passion .
Compositionally , Bach employed the special characteristics of the alto ( or mezzosoprano ) voice , to represent this painful paradox .
This becomes clear , for example in the concluding refrain of  Ach Golgatha [ See Figure 2 ] , which drops from a D♭ in the middle register to the E♭ in the chest register , before Bach ends the alto voice in the middle register on the shallow - sounding G , polyphonically set against the oboe voices .
With the oboes and the accompanying pizzicato bass , which are polyphonically singing with the human voice , Bach created one of the most gripping of vocal compositions .
This is also true with respect to its harmonic boldness , which anticipates the paradoxes of the later theme of his A Musical Offering .
The opening interval  Ach Golgatha [ See Figure 3 ] , which consists of a diminished seventh E♭ to G♭=F♯ , was later used by Mozart and Beethoven , for example in Beethovens Piano Sonata Opus 111 [ See Figure 4 ] .
The paradoxes of the poetic text are characterized by a succession of Lydian interval - leaps and combinations .
Each Lydian interval sung by the soloist also introduces a new degree of poetic tension in the text .
For example , as shown in Figure 5 , in the lines der Segen und das Heil der Welt / wird als ein Fluch ans Kreuz gestellt 
(  The blessing and the salvation of the world / is being , as if a curse , put up on the cross ) , the contraries  Der Segen and ans Kreuz are both sung on Lydian intervals .
This is a peculiarity which Mozart discovered in 1782 - 83 , based on A Musical Offering , as a new tool of composition .
In earlier times , this Lydian interval was outright cursed as Tritonus , the devil ( Diabolus ) in music .
One of the special characteristics of the Lydian interval is connected with the matrix of the six species of voices .
The natural shift in the register upwards or downwards occurs either at distances of the octave or Lydian interval .
So one can say : The Lydian interval is the smallest interval - unit which effects a register shift in all of the voice species .
There are only six Lydian intervals , and they remain the same upwards or downwards , i.e. , also in the inversion [ See Figure 6 ] .
The particularly impressive recording of  Ach Golgotha which I will play , is from the year 1954 , under the direction of Wilhelm Furtwängler with the Vienna Philharmonic orchestra , one of the very few performances of the Passion under Furtwängler .
2
Furtwängler died that year .
The alto is Marga Hoeffgen .
In this performance , the young Dietrich Fischer - Dieskau sang the words of Christ [ See autograph , Figure 7 ] .
One characteristic of all Classical music , as you can perceive it in the interpretation of this segment of the St. Mathhew Passion , is carried by the fundamental idea of the Passion , love agape in the Christian sense .
In other words , the essential musical emotion is not sensuousness , but agape , as Plato and the Apostle Paul define that emotion .
In true contrapuntal polyphony , the essential ideas of the composition are chiefly defined in two ways .
First , as physical principles are defined in science , by ontological paradoxes .
In music , the relevant paradoxes are posed by the metaphorical forms of transitions , lawfully generated dissonances , generated within the composition .
Second , by explicit or implied quotation from ideas stated in other compositions , either by the same , or other composers .
For this reason , the two late works , A Musical Offering and The Art of the Fugue , about which we shall learn more from Professor Vyaskova , have their prominent importance for succeeding musical revolutions .
Bachs A Musical Offering I shall play three short examples from A Musical Offering to illustrate this .
What is striking in the basic theme of A Musical Offering , is the seemingly paradoxical F♯ in the C - minor key area , that F♯ in the second part of the royal theme , along with the already - mentioned diminished seventh A♭ - N - B♮ , which Bach put on the first accentuated beat of the bar .
With the entrance of the second voice , this allows for the development of lawful dissonances , which were so inspiring for succeeding generations of composers .
Then , we shall hear two further canons , the very compressed short form of A Musical Offering by Bach , with the characteristics of the simultaneous upward and downward movements of the same contrapuntal voice , thus the ambiguity of the intervals , which Bach formulated as the simple movement [ See Figure 8 ] , and then the inversion of the movement [ See Figures 9 and 10 ] .
In a letter written to Nicolaus Hartsöcker around 1711 , Leibniz wrote the following on the subject of dissonances :
The imperfections which exist in the universe are like the dissonances in an excellent composition , which , in the opinion of those who well understand the connection , contribute to make this [ the composition ] more perfect .
And to Goldbach ( a correspondent mathematician from St. Petersburg ) , he wrote about the sparing use of dissonances :
Dissonances are pleasing as an occasional accompanying element and are employed to great effect : they are inserted between the harmonious sounds [ Wohlklänge ] like shadows in the order and in the light , so that we all take great joy in the great order .
Mozarts  Great Mass in c-minor And to Goldbach ( a correspondent mathematician from St. Petersburg ) , he wrote about the sparing use of dissonances : Mozart understood this revolution which Bach had introduced , and he , in turn , revolutionized his method of composition with the principle of  Motivführung . 
One fruit of this effort to extend the C - minor / F♯ paradox he recognized in Bach , is represented by Mozarts incomplete Mass in C- minor , where the use of the four - voice chorus , especially the fugal part , is built on a variation of the second part of the royal theme , the towering polyphonies of the  Kyrie introductory chorus [ See Figure 11 ] .
This work , which was composed some 35 years after Bachs A Musical Offering and The Art of the Fugue , opened the way to a new freedom of musical expression .
Another 50 years would pass , until , with the immense Missa Solemnis of Beethoven , written in 1824 and performed for the first time in St. Petersburg , Bachs revolutionary discovery would be brought to a new culmination point in the art of composition .
If we can follow and relive the progressions of such magnificent musical thought - objects  today , in the year 2000 , which commemorates the anniversary of Bachs death ; and if we can make this musical revolution really intelligible ; then we can take the branches of human knowledge the natural sciences and the science of art , which , thanks to the immoral Immanuel Kant , were artificially divided once again back to their single source : the creative Reason of man .

After a while , this attitude can take over just about everything .
You start to notice your living quarters are getting nicer , more expensive , bigger and emptier .
Single players usually ride this path right into enormous homes with no one living there except themselves and a dog , if they even have a dog .
You have more services than you do socks .
The walls around your home also get higher  gated communities to protect privacy .
Maybe you get that security system you thought was cool .
For part of my career in Philadelphia , I lived directly across the street from Randy Wolf , a teammate and friend .
I did n’t see him for almost two years unless it was at the ballpark .
Soon you are getting farther away from your original tastes and closer to what you think a major - leaguer is supposed to live like .
It takes a lot of introspection to realize that as you are “ upgrading ” you hit an invisible peak and then hit this precipitous downhill slope of declining benefits  because this particular home plate keeps moving , teasing you into needing to go just a little further .
Sure , you could date actresses and supermodels until you pry Angelina Jolie away from Brad Pitt , but you forget that when your career is over , the people whose approval you ’ve been seeking stop paying attention .
( Then again , baseball players have no sense of time ; there is no clock pushing us to do anything . )
These diminishing returns are reflected in lost time or lost opportunity .
Maybe you spend so much time chasing Halle Berry through her agent that you forgot about the girlfriend who was there for you when you had back surgery in the minor leagues .
Maybe you get on a two - year waiting list for a car that only three people in the world have , only to miss driving your first car , the one with the sticky windshield wipers .
Or maybe that McMansion going up on the waterfront for you and your posse ( so that you can get onto “ MTV Cribs ” ) takes so long to build that when your grandmother passes away you realize you spent more time looking at floor plans than sharing her last moments .
I recall a teammate at Yankee spring training giving me this wisdom about saving money : “ Get a chef , you ’ll save on groceries . ”
Sure , why not ?
But it ’s a shame when , deep down , you really love to cook .
We call it advancement , the act of getting closer to something ahead or in front of us .
But when we lock in on that target as the next step , sometimes we forget what got us here .
The need to demonstrate success , the show and the glitter , all play into why we can end up chasing illusions that take us away from our true selves .
All players battle with this in some form , and most get lost for at least a moment or two ( if you are lucky , that ’s the worst of it ) .
But when you get disoriented , you just have to be courageous enough to turn around , re-group and look for home .
That place where you can look closer at the match - up of needs versus wants .
Something all the more pressing in today ’s climate .
Even if you have to go back down those stairs for a while .
This has to be one of the weirdest and least defensible policy changes imaginable .
Mein Kampf is fine .
Jackie Collins is fine .
But books about gay subjects are now " adult " on Amazon and so not included on best seller lists or rankings .
Sure enough , " Virtually Normal " and " Love Undetectable " have been de-listed and stripped of customer sales rankings .
Jackie Collins ' " Married Lovers " has n't .
My books contain discussions of Aquinas and Freud and Foucault and Burke .
I 'm puzzled as to why those authors are more " adult " than Collins ' adulterous couplings .
We want to hear what you think about this article .

Several UK mobile broadband providers have started to block access to The Pirate Bay as part of a new voluntary code of practice .
The reason for the block is not related to copyright infringement , but most likely due to the fact that there are ' adult ' torrents hosted on the site .
Starting today , BT Mobile Broadband users are disallowed access to the largest BitTorrent tracker on the Internet , instead they get a “ content blocked ” message .
This proactive filtering mechanism is part of a voluntary self regulation scheme through which the the mobile broadband providers hope to keep children safe from all the horrors of the Internet .
The code of practice identifies several types of content that could be harmful to children , and encourages ISPs to filter these type of sites .
Among the filtered content are gambling sites , pornographic material and hacking tutorials .
BitTorrent or other file - sharing related sites are not blocked according to the code .
It is not clear why The Pirate bay ended up on the block list , but the most plausible reason seems to be their diverse adult torrent collection .
The code does n’t allow any sexually explicit material , legal or not , and The Pirate Bay does offer ‘ links ’ to such content , although it does n’t carry any itself – sound familiar ?
The reason why the code is specifically aimed at mobile providers is the increase in mobile devices youngsters have access to without oversight .
All sites that have an ‘ over 18 ’ status are included and all access to these sites is simply blocked .
Customers who want to lift the block to one of the sites may do so by contacting customer service .
This is not the first time that The Pirate Bay , for one reason or another , has been blocked by Internet service providers .
We ’ve seen similar things happen in Italy , Turkey , Denmark and several other countries .
However , this is the first time that the reason for the blockade is not copyright related .
Whether or not the code will prevent minors from seeing too much flesh is up for debate , but although the comparison between Google and The Pirate Bay has been a hot one this week , one thing is certain – there is a hell of a lot more porn to be found via a Google image search than is to be found on The Pirate Bay .
Failing that there ’s always daddy ’s porn mags to fall back on – quick , board up the newsstand .

President Barack Obama gave an unprecedented adress to the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran and to its people on the occasion of the Persian New Year , “ Now - Ruz , ” which is celebrated on the vernal equinox .
Obama caught the spirit of renewal that marks the special day ’s commemoration , when he spoke of a changed world situation .
The Iranian newspaper Hamshahri specifically mentioned more than once that Obama addressed both the government and the people .
Farideh Farhi , writing at “ Informed Comment : Global Affairs , ” explains the significance of the phrase :
After locating more than 340 planets orbiting other stars , astronomers have identified two that are the most similar to Earth so far .
The most recently discovered one is almost twice as large as Earth , making it the smallest exoplanet -- for extra -solar planet -- found to date .
The second one was found in 2007 , but new observations have shown that it is the only exoplanet to date that orbits its star in the so - called habitable zone , where water remains a liquid .
Thus , it is the only exoplanet discovered that is likely to have oceans .
Intriguingly , both orbit the same star , a dwarf 20 light - years from Earth called Gliese 581 , European researchers said Tuesday .
The identification of the small planet “ is a remarkable discovery and bodes well for our eventual discovery of a true Earth - like , habitable planet , ” astronomer Alan Boss of the Carnegie Institution of Washington wrote in an e-mail .

It “ is the most exciting discovery in exoplanets so far , ” added astronomer Geoffrey W. Marcy of UC Berkeley via e-mail .
“ It shows that nature makes such small planets , probably in large numbers . ”
The small planet is the fourth discovered circling Gliese 581 by a team of astronomers working with the European Southern Observatory ’s 3.6 - meter telescope at La Silla , Chile .
They identified the planets by detecting and analyzing slight wobbles in the star ’s path as the planets orbit it .
The small planet , called Gliese 581 e , has an estimated mass equal to 1.9 Earths and orbits its sun every 3.15 days , the team reported at an astronomical meeting at the University of Hertfordshire in Britain .
Because it is so close to Gliese 581 , it is blisteringly hot , and any gases or liquids that it might have carried have long since dissipated , leaving only uninhabitable rock .
In February , French astronomers said they had discovered an even smaller planet , called CoRoT - Exo - 7b , that has an estimated mass equal to 1.7 Earths , circling a different star .
But experts said the data for Gliese 581 e is more convincing .

The other three planets in the Gliese system have masses of 16 , five and seven Earths .
The one with a mass of seven Earths , called Gliese 581 d , was initially thought to have an orbital period of 80 days , which would put it just on the outer edge of the habitable zone .
Recent refinements of the data , however , show that it has an orbit of only 66.8 days , which places it well within the habitable zone , astronomer Stephane Udry of Geneva University told the meeting .
Because of its distance from Gliese 581 , moreover , it must have a significant amount of water and other gases , he added .
It could have oceans thousands of meters deep , he said .
The team is continuing to monitor Gliese 581 in hopes that the orbital planes of the planets will bring them between the star and Earth , which will allow astronomers to learn more about their composition .

In science , the grandest revolutions are often triggered by the smallest discrepancies .
In the 16th century , based on what struck many of his contemporaries as the esoteric minutiae of celestial motions , Copernicus suggested that Earth was not , in fact , at the center of the universe .
In our own era , another revolution began to unfold 11 years ago with the discovery of the accelerating universe .
A tiny deviation in the brightness of exploding stars led astronomers to conclude that they had no idea what 70 percent of the cosmos consists of .
All they could tell was that space is filled with a substance unlike any other one that pushes along the expansion of the universe rather than holding it back .
This substance became known as dark energy .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The government confirmed Thursday that the U.S. economy suffered its largest drop in 26 years during the fourth quarter .
The nation 's gross domestic product , the broadest measure of economic activity , fell at an annual rate of 6.3 % during the final three months of 2008 .
That 's slightly worse than the government 's previous estimate of a 6.2 % drop in the period .
Economists surveyed by Briefing.com had forecast that GDP would fall at a 6.6 % rate in the latest reading .
The drop is the biggest one - quarter decline in this key measure since the first three months of 1982 .
The report showed broad based declines across various measures of economic activity .
Spending by consumers fell at a 4.3 % rate , with purchases of large ticket items plunging 22 % .
Investment in housing fell 23 % from already depressed levels , completing three straight years of declines in that sector .
Investment in equipment and software , taken as a measure of business spending , plunged at a 28 % rate .
Exports tumbled at a 24 % rate .
The economic problems have obviously not ended with the fourth quarter report .
Economists surveyed by the National Association for Business Economics forecast a 5 % rate of decline in the first quarter , which ends Tuesday , followed by a 1.7 % drop in the second quarter .
Still , Bernard Baumohl , executive director of The Economic Outlook Group , said that some recent economic readings on housing and retail sales that have come in better than expected in the last couple of weeks suggest that the recession may be approaching a bottom .
" I 'm much more encouraged than I was at the end of 2008 , " he said .
" I think it 's winding down . "
Baumohl added there could be a slight improvement in GDP the second half of this year , but the economy is likely to stay sluggish well into 2010 .
But other economists say it 's too soon to say the worst is over .
Brian Bethune , chief U.S. financial economist at Global Insight , said there needs to be signs of a more widespread economic recovery in the auto and retailing sectors before banks start lending again .
He does n't expect even a modest pick - up in GDP until the fourth quarter of this year .
" The underlying economy is still very precarious , " said Bethune .
" Even if housing is showing signs of a turnaround , there are several more boxes to check before we get to the point where the overall economy starts to revive . "

The shocking arsenal of terror left by the Lahore cricket killers
This is the terrifying cache of weapons abandoned by the murderers responsible for the Lahore cricket atrocity
On the table are 40 magazines of ammunition , 25 hand grenades , submachine guns , rocket - propelled grenades and plastic explosives .
Pakistani police also discovered food and water , suggesting the terrorists may have planned a long stand - off with the police or to kidnap the Sri Lankan cricket team .
The haul of weapons includes 40 magazines of ammunition , 25 hand grenades , submachine guns , rocket - propelled grenades and plastic explosives
Police said the gunmen arrived at the scene in motorised rickshaws and two cars .
The weapons were among those abandoned in one of the rickshaws and found nearby .
Salman Taseer , the governor of Punjab province , said : ' These people were highly trained and highly armed - the way they were holding their guns , the way they were taking aim and shooting at the police .
' They used the same methods as the terrorists who attacked Mumbai . '
Scathing : Ex -England cricketer Chris Broad after flying home today .
He claims the Pakistani security forces vanished when the terrorists struck
As the weapons haul was revealed , the former England cricketer caught in the middle of the attacks accused police of ' vanishing ' just before the gunmen struck .
Chris Broad has been hailed a hero for his actions as 12 extremists opened fire on buses carrying the Sri Lankan team and match officials to the ground in Lahore .
But he played down his bravery yesterday and instead turned his anger on the Pakistani authorities .

He said they had promised ' presidential - style security ' for the party , only to leave them ' sitting ducks ' when they were ambushed .
Mr Broad , 51 , the match referee , said that moments beforehand armed police had been patrolling every junction they passed , but just before the shooting began the bulk of the escort had melted away .
' I am extremely angry that we were promised high - level security and in our hour need that security vanished , ' he said .

Umpire Nadeem Ghouri had claimed that Mr Broad had dived on top of fellow umpire Ahsan Raza after seeing him struck by a bullet , but the Englishman denied this .
Mr Broad , whose son Stuart is playing for England in the West Indies , told a press conference in Manchester yesterday that he had lain on the floor throughout the 15 - minute attack and had tried to comfort Mr Raza .
Last night , Mr Raza was in a critical condition .

If you ’re a fan of Battlestar Galactica , whether you liked the finale or hated it , there will be ( almost – keep reading ) no more .
So now what ?
Will Friday nights now be spent cradling a DVD boxset of Firefly ?
Now , I offer no guarantees , but here are some upcoming series that may help fill the void – or at least , the SciFi channel ( or “ SyFy ” which I still ca n’t quite get on board with ) hopes they will .
After all , if Patton Oswalt is right and it really is the silver age of television , then it can only get better from here .
Caprica
This is probably the obvious choice – a prequel of sorts to BSG , Caprica is set about 50 years before the current series .
Whereas it does tell the story of how humanity created the cylons who would ultimately cause their destruction , it ’s been described as a “ family science fiction drama . ”
The early trailer made it look more like a Romeo & Juliet type story about dueling families than what you might expect from the BSG world , but the new trailer that aired during Friday ’s finale seems more promising .
Fortunately , we wo n’t have to wait too long to find out ; the pilot is premiering on DVD on April 21 .
Though after that , it ’s a wait until 2010 for the actual series to start airing on television .
Stargate Universe
The third installment in the popular Stargate series , Stargate Universe is set to begin airing on the SciFi channel in October .
Described as a “ separate entity ” rather than a spin - off like Stargate Atlantis , the new series involves a ship that gets stuck in the far reaches of the universe .
That actually sounds a little familiar – Voyager , anyone ?
In any case , it ’s supposedly darker than the other two , and also more relationship - based .
( Stargate is one of those series that has inspired massive amounts of fan fiction , so I ’m not sure if that ’s considered a good thing or a bad thing for those writers . )
Warehouse 13
A preview for this new SciFi channel show aired during the BSG finale as well , which was actually the first I ’d heard of it .
It was a pretty long trailer for a commercial , and after it was over I still felt like I had no idea what the show was about .
Something about FBI agents … and a giant warehouse … and weird stuff ?
Apparently it ’s part X - Files , part Raiders of the Lost Ark , and part Moonlighting , which from what I ’ve seen sounds about accurate .
Oh , and it features a male “ rule - bending ” agent and a female “ by - the - book ” agent , which I guess comes from the “ if it ai n’t broke do n’t fix it ” school of television writing .
Though the female agent is played by Joanne Kelly , who was really hot as the vampire Bianca in the short - lived Dresden Files series .
This one will start airing this summer .
Of course , for those of you who do n’t want to wait for your new science fiction fix , let me throw out a recommendation if you have n’t already checked it out :
Dollhouse
This new show got pretty mixed reviews at the beginning , but after the new episode on Friday night ( which , since it overlapped with the 2 - hour BSG finale , I watched yesterday on Hulu ) , I ’m completely sold .
I think that the show may have suffered from the FOX curse of rearraranging episodes at the beginning ( and that worked so well with Firefly ) , but now it ’s hitting its stride .
Plus , if you ’re missing BSG , you can get your weekly fix of Tahmoh Penikett ( Helo on BSG and Agent Ballard on Dollhouse ) .
Also appearing on Friday ’s episode was Mark Sheppard – Romo Lampkin on BSG , though you may also remember him as Badger from Firefly – as another FBI agent .
I personally rather like Joss Whedon ’s tendency to use the same actors over and over , but only because he also tends to pick good actors .
I think Eliza Dushku ( Faith on Buffy the Vampire Slayer ) and Amy Acker ( Fred on Angel ) are doing a great job on Dollhouse .
( And while I ’m on the subject of Joss ’s actors , I ’ll give a tentative thumbs - up to ABC ’s new show Castle that airs on Monday nights , though Nathan Fillion – Mal from Firefly – is definitely the best part . )
So if your Friday nights are now woefully science fiction free , you may want to give Dollhouse a try .
Or wait and see what SciFi ( SyFy ? Hrm. ) has in store next … but wait !
As I mentioned , BSG is n’t quite over yet , and that ’s not just a reference to Caprica .
Airing in November is a new TV movie , a “ reimagined ” version of BSG – from the point of view of the cylons .
Battlestar Galactica : The Plan is directed by Edward James Olmos ( aka Admiral Adama ) , who says that it will make fans want to watch the whole series over again .
I ’m sure the DVD box set will be out just in time .
It is , to the best of my knowledge , the first time that the issue of Microsoft 's patent threats against Linux have been framed in a context of anticompetitive conduct .
It presents a history , albeit not totally comprehensive , of some of the notable anticompetitive conduct from the past , like against DR - DOS and Netscape and WordPerfect , but it also presents current issues , including the saga of how ISO / IEC DIS 29500 , formerly known as OOXML , got approved as a standard :
The EC is also investigating Microsoft 's actions to manipulate the vote of the International Organization for Standardization / International Electrotechnical Commission on the recent standardization of Office " Open " XML ( " OOXML " ) .
As reported widely in the press and on the Internet , Microsoft 's manipulation of the standards setting process in favor of OOXML included financial inducements , threats , misleading information , and committee - stuffing .
These investigations are compelling examples of Microsoft 's continued misconduct related to its monopolies in operating systems and other products .
The paper mentions the netbook market in the section on the patent threats .
Not only are the patents Microsoft claims are infringed not identified , they are of questionable value after recent court decisions , and no one can make sense of the current patent climate in the US to even know if they are or are not violating someone 's patents , and that is just as true of proprietary as with Open Source software , the paper notes , ending that section like this :
Microsoft has sought to exploit the current absence of clarity in patent law in order to deter consumers from taking up offerings competing with Microsoft 's own products .
Microsoft also used its monopoly power to control industry standards , thus requiring WordPerfect to implement proprietary technology or risk incompatibility with Windows .
Once Microsoft had achieved wide distribution for its own browser through these tactics , it then moved to " extend " ( in effect , customize ) industry standards for HyperText Markup Language ( " HTML " ) and Cascading StyleSheets ( " CSS " ) to ensure that users would become reliant on Microsoft 's own web browser .
Microsoft also introduced its ActiveX technology extensions , which allowed software written much like traditional computer programs to run in the Internet Explorer browser , but that only worked on Microsoft 's monopoly operating system .
Then when it came to servers , we find similar conduct :
In the mid to late 1990s , computer networks were growing in speed and Microsoft sensed a threat to its core operating system monopoly from more centralized , server - based computing .
Determined to head off any potential competition , Microsoft decided that it needed to add server operating systems to the " moat " surrounding its Windows operating system monopoly .
To gain inroads into this market , Microsoft embraced industry standards for file - and - print sharing , user management , and identity verification so that its products would be compatible with the then - prominent Unix server operating systems .
But as Microsoft 's server systems started to gain a foothold in the market , Microsoft quietly started to " extend " support for industry standard protocols in its Windows operating system so that Windows clients would have a better experience when connected to Microsoft 's servers .
Eventually , by changing its Windows personal computer operating system so that Windows computers could not fully connect to any server that did not use Microsoft 's proprietary extensions unless the users installed special software on their machines , Microsoft established and reinforced its dominance in the work group server operating system market , where Microsoft maintains a share of approximately 77 % .
Even when Microsoft claims to be implementing a standard , the reality is that Microsoft 's implementations routinely either only partially conform or else somehow extend the standard , so that software developed to work with Microsoft 's version of the standard will not work with other vendors ' implementations of the same standard .
As just one example , Microsoft recently announced that Internet Explorer 8 would support a feature called " local storage , " which allows websites to store a limited amount of data on users ' computers so that users can interact with those sites offline , a feature that could help web applications become effective replacements for traditional desktop applications ....
Unfortunately , Microsoft 's implementation is subtly incompatible with the standard , which could lead web developers who test their sites in Internet Explorer 8 to write their sites in a way that will not work in other browsers .
Microsoft takes the long view .
How about you ?
And how soon should the market notice such things and do something before it is too late , would you say ?
If you are a government or an agency , how are you going to avoid lock - in with the Microsoft standard ?
What evidence of change are you relying on ?
No. Seriously .
ECIS has just been granted standing as " an interested third party " in the EU Commission 's current antitrust investigation of Microsoft , which resulted in preliminary findings that Microsoft is violating EU antitrust law by tying IE to Windows .
This paper is in support of those findings .
The opening words and the conclusion explain the purpose of this filing and the hopes behind it :
On January 15 , 2009 , the European Commission issued a new Statement of Objections to Microsoft , outlining the Commission 's " preliminary view that Microsoft 's tying of its web browser Internet Explorer to its dominant operating system Windows infringes the EC Treaty rules on abuse of a dominant position ( Article 82 ) " and " distorts competition on the merits between competing web browsers . "
The European Commission 's recent Statement of Objections validates the ongoing and urgent need to address Microsoft 's practices that affect the openness of the Internet , consumer choice , and competition in general .
This paper provides a brief history of Microsoft 's misconduct and demonstrates that , in light of Microsoft 's long and continuing use of anticompetitive tactics , the Commission 's concerns are well justified ....
Microsoft 's conduct over the last two decades has demonstrated Microsoft 's willingness and ability to engage in unlawful conduct to protect and extend its core monopolies .
This conduct has caused real harm to consumers , who continue to pay high prices and use lower quality products than would have prevailed in a competitive market .
By understanding Microsoft 's history of anticompetitive conduct , developers , consumer groups , and government authorities will be better equipped to recognize current and future Microsoft misconduct at an early stage and intervene to prevent Microsoft from using tactics other than competition on the merits .
ECIS remains hopeful that the European Commission 's latest Statement of Objections addressing Microsoft 's misconduct will finally mark the beginning of the end of Microsoft 's two decades of anticompetitive behavior and consumer harm .
Groklaw also has a collection of legal filings in the Caldera v. Microsoft case regarding DR - DOS , which are also referenced , so those of you who do n't have PACER accounts can read what is available and follow along .
Also referenced is Novell v. Microsoft , the antitrust case regarding WordPerfect , and we have that too .
The reference to smiling at Novell while pulling the trigger can be found in Novell 's complaint , but if you 'd like to read it in full , you 'll find it on this Groklaw page , a report on the Comes v. Microsoft antitrust trial in Iowa , where portions of this Jim Allchin email were read to the jury :
" We need to slaughter Novell before they get stronger ....
If you 're going to kill someone , there is n't much reason to get all worked up about it and angry .
You just pull the trigger .
Any discussions beforehand are a waste of time .
We need to smile at Novell while we pull the trigger . "
One can learn from history .
ECIS notes this about the US antitrust case :
Unfortunately , however , as discussed further below and as noted by several prominent commentators , the U.S. browser case was settled with a consent decree that has been wholly ineffective in restoring competition to the state that prevailed prior to Microsoft 's unlawful actions .
Ellison and Sun co-founder and Chairman Scott McNealy were among the valley business leaders who pushed for the Department of Justice to file its antitrust suit against Microsoft in 1998 .
In the end , Ellison found the 2001 settlement of the case " astonishing . "
Microsoft , he complained , " lost the trial , but the government paid them a reward for violating the law . "
Prominent valley business attorney Gary L. Reback notes Ellison 's comments in his new book " Fight the Market ! "
Two years later , Reback points out , Ellison would draw " inspiration for the Antitrust Division 's indolence " and publicly proclaim his plans to " roll up " the market for complex mission - critical business software " into very , very few companies with one dominant player , " Oracle .
Here it is as text , so the entire world can read it , including those who depend on screen readers and so that it is easily searchable .
There are 176 footnotes !
This text version , then , was indeed a labor of love .
We made the following change : we collected all the footnotes at the end , with links that will take you back and forth easily .
Just click on the footnote number .
That makes it easier for the blind to read a long and complex document like this one , without footnotes interspersed confusingly in the middle of sentences .
Other than that , we hope it 's exactly the same , as we strive for accuracy .
But as we always say , for anything that matters , please rely on the PDF .
Perfection is a mighty high bar .

" This anti-trust thing will blow over .
We have n't changed our business practices at all . "
-- Bill Gates , Microsoft founder and then - CEO ( 1995 )
3
Microsoft owns several monopoly products , including its Windows operating system and Office suite of productivity applications .
4
These monopolies are extremely lucrative : Microsoft
That barrier -- the " applications barrier to entry " -- stems from two characteristics of the software market : ( 1 ) most consumers prefer operating systems for which a large number of applications have already been written ; and ( 2 ) most developers prefer to write for operating systems that already have a substantial consumer base .
This " chicken - and - egg " situation ensures that applications will continue to be written for the already dominant Windows , which in turn ensures that consumers will continue to prefer it over other operating systems .
7
If we own the key " franchises " built on top of the operating system , we dramatically widen the " moat " that protects the operating system business ....
We hope to make a lot of money off these franchises , but even more important is that they should protect our Windows royalty per PC ....
And success in those businesses will help increase the opportunity for future pricing discretion .

Although Microsoft has paid many multimillion - dollar settlements for its antitrust violations over the years , these settlements have proven a small price for such a large ongoing revenue stream .
Microsoft 's past conduct demonstrates its ability and willingness to engage in

MICROSOFT'S HISTORY OF ANTICOMPETITIVE CONDUCT
This section reviews a number of Microsoft 's past actions to extinguish potential competitive threats .
These include Microsoft's : ( a ) campaign against DR - DOS ; ( b ) anticompetitive per processor license fees ; ( c ) retaliation against IBM ; ( d ) threats and retaliation against Intel ; ( e ) elimination of Word Perfect ; ( f ) deceptive WISE software program ; ( g ) elimination of Netscape ; ( h ) deception of Java developers ; ( i ) elimination of rival media players ; and ( j ) campaign against rival server operating systems .
While not comprehensive , these examples of Microsoft 's past misconduct provide a clear illustration of the types of acts that Microsoft has taken to protect and extend its monopolies .
A. Microsoft's Campaign To Destroy DR -DOS
" [ W ]e need to make sure Windows 3.1 only runs on top of MS DOS . "
-- David Cole , Microsoft Senior Vice - President10
" The approach we will take is to detect dr [ DOS ] 6 and refuse to load .
The error
message should be something like ' Invalid device driver interface . ' "
-- Phillip Barrett , Microsoft Windows Development Manager11
In the early 1980s , Microsoft purchased an early version of a standard disk operating system ( " DOS " ) that became known as MS - DOS .
12
At the time , a number of rival operating systems offered features , such as the ability to run multiple programs at the same time , that Microsoft 's operating systems would not offer until years later .
13
At the time , operating systems were just beginning to move from a command - based interface to a graphical user interface .
14 Microsoft developed a graphical user interface known as Windows .15 Early versions of Windows did not actually " run " the computer rather , they were a shell surrounding the underlying DOS program , which in turn ran the computer .
16 Initially , Windows embraced the DOS standard , which meant that Windows would run on top of any DOS , including DR - DOS , Microsoft 's principal rival in the DOS market .17
3
In the case of DR - DOS , Microsoft 's initial decision to make Windows interoperable helped promote rapid adoption of the Windows shell .
At the same time , however , it meant that many consumers chose the superior DR - DOS over MS - DOS .
In an email to then - Vice President Steve Ballmer , Microsoft founder and then - CEO Bill Gates wrote :
" Our DOS gold mine is shrinking and our costs are soaring -- primarily due to low prices , IBM share , and DR - DOS ....
I believe people underestimate the impact that DR - DOS has had on us in terms of pricing .
"

B. Microsoft's Anticompetitive Per Processor License Fees
" Another [ DR - DOS ] prospect bites the dust with a per-processor DOS agreement . "
-- Microsoft sales employee in an internal email27
In 1994 , the U.S. Department of Justice ( " DOJ " ) filed an antitrust suit against Microsoft challenging this conduct , resulting in a consent decree under which Microsoft agreed to stop using per processor license fees .
29
But the anticompetitive practice had already been quite effective in reducing competitors ' share , particularly when combined with Microsoft 's other actions directed against DR - DOS.30
The DOJ consent decree also sought to impose some

C. Microsoft's Retaliation And Price Discrimination Against IBM
" As long as IBM is working first on their competitive offerings and prefers to fiercely compete with us in critical areas , we should just be honest with each other and admit that such priorities will not lead to a most exciting relationship .... "
-- Joachim Kempin , Microsoft Senior Vice - President32

Microsoft's Organized Collective Boycott Against Intel
" Intel has to accept that when we have a solution we like that is decent that that is the solution that wins . "
-- Bill Gates , Microsoft founder and then - CEO37
Microsoft used a similar approach in 1995 , when it forced Intel to drop development of Native Signal Processing ( " NSP " ) , a set of instructions that would have allowed a computer 's processor to directly support audio , video , and 3D graphics .
Intel is a manufacturer of microprocessor chips that are purchased by OEMs to use in the computers they manufacture .
With NSP , Intel hoped to create a platform for multimedia applications that would run on any operating system , not just Windows .
Microsoft thus viewed NSP as a serious threat to its Windows monopoly .
In order to extinguish NSP , Microsoft told Intel that it would make Windows incompatible with Intel chips if Intel did not abandon the technology , and Microsoft forced its OEM customers into a collective boycott of Intel 's microprocessor chips .38 Bill Gates reported to other senior Microsoft executives , " Intel feels we have all the OEMs on hold with our NSP chill .
" 39 Intel ultimately ceded to Microsoft 's pressure and abandoned its NSP development efforts .
40
Shortly thereafter , Microsoft again put pressure on Intel .
This time around , Microsoft wanted Intel to stop assisting Sun Microsystems in the promotion of its Java technology .
As Bill Gates wrote in a 1997 email message , " If Intel has a real problem with us supporting [ Intel 's microprocessor rival , AMD ] then they will have to stop supporting Java Multimedia the way they are . "
41
As a district court subsequently found , Microsoft 's campaign to induce " Intel to stop helping Sun create Java Multimedia APIs , especially ones that run well ... on Windows " was a successful one .
42
E. Microsoft's Elimination Of Word Perfect
" If we own the key ' franchises ' built on top of the operating system , we
dramatically widen the ' moat ' that protects the operating system business ....
We
hope to make a lot of money off these franchises , but even more important is that
7
they should protect our Windows royalty per PC . "
-- Jeff Raikes , Microsoft President43
" I have decided that we should not publish these [ Windows 95 user interface ]
extensions .
We should wait until we have a way to do a high level of integration
that will be harder for likes of Notes , WordPerfect to achieve , and which will give
Office a real advantage ....
We can't compete with Lotus and WordPerfect / Novell without this . "
-- Bill Gates , Microsoft founder and then - CEO44
Beginning in 1994 , Microsoft launched an anticompetitive campaign to extinguish WordPerfect , an office productivity application owned by Novell and competing with Microsoft 's Office suite .
Office productivity applications ( including word processing , spreadsheet , and presentation applications ) are one of the most important groups of applications and contribute substantially to the applications barrier to entry protecting Microsoft 's operating system monopoly .
When Microsoft began this campaign , WordPerfect enjoyed widespread popularity .
In order to eliminate its competitor , Microsoft withheld crucial technical information about Windows , going so far as to extend the Windows API , the set of commands a program uses to communicate with the operating system , to ensure that WordPerfect did not work smoothly with Microsoft 's monopoly operating system .
45 Microsoft also used its monopoly power to control industry standards , thus requiring WordPerfect to implement proprietary technology or risk incompatibility with Windows .
46
And it excluded WordPerfect from the major channels of distribution for office productivity applications .
47
For example , Microsoft forbade OEMs from pre-installing Novell products and gave discounts for refusing to sell other developers ' office productivity applications .
48 As part of Microsoft 's strategy to eliminate Novell , " [ a ] top Microsoft executive wrote that Microsoft should ' smile ' at Novell , falsely signifying Microsoft 's willingness to help the two companies ' common customers integrate their various products ,
8
Microsoft extinguished WordPerfect and gained a monopoly in office productivity application suites , accomplishing its goal of " dramatically widen[ ing ] the moat " protecting its lucrative Windows monopoly .
F. Microsoft's Deceptive WISE Software Program
" Please give me one good reason why we should even consider [ enabling Microsoft technology to work on competing systems ] .
( Hint : any good answer needs to include making more money and helping kill Unix , Sybase or Oracle . ) "
-- James Allchin , Microsoft Senior Vice - President51
In 1994 , Microsoft engaged in similarly deceptive conduct to combat the growing popularity of the UNIX operating system within corporate networks .
Microsoft faced a choice : whether to " love it to death ( invest a lot of money and kill it slowly ) or ignore it ( invest no money on the expectation it will die quickly ) .
" 52 Microsoft chose initially " to invest in interoperating " with UNIX,53 by promoting its Windows Interface Source Environment
9
Microsoft 's plan was successful .
By 1996 Microsoft had captured a large share of the corporate market .
Microsoft then took the next step in its standard " embrace , extend , extinguish " playbook and extended the Windows API without copying its changes to the WISE program .
This meant that developers could no longer smoothly port applications to UNIX and Macintosh .55
In public , however , Microsoft continued to lead developers into believing that this software was still fully cross-platform .
56
In 1997 , Bill Gates noted in an internal email that those developers who wrote applications for the then - available software without realizing that it would not port all APIs to UNIX and Macintosh were " just f*****. " 57 He was right : Microsoft had successfully extinguished the cross- platform threat to its operating system monopoly .
In a subsequent antitrust suit , a district court called this move " a classic ' bait - and - switch ' tactic .
"
58
G. Microsoft's Elimination Of Netscape
" Microsoft first proposed to Netscape that , rather than compete with each other , the two companies should enter an illegal conspiracy to divide up the market .
When Netscape refused , Microsoft then used its Windows monopoly to , in Microsoft 's own words , ' cut off Netscape 's air supply . ' "
-- Joel Klein , Assistant Attorney General ( quoting Paul Maritz , Microsoft 's then - Group Vice President of the Platform Applications Group ) 59
10
Microsoft first sought to deal with this threat through a direct market allocation proposal : Microsoft told Netscape that if Netscape would agree to stop exposing APIs , Microsoft would provide Netscape with special help in developing " value - added " software applications that relied on Microsoft 's proprietary technologies .
60 Netscape rejected Microsoft 's proposal .
Microsoft then responded by taking steps to " cut off Netscape 's air supply .
"
61 It developed its own web browser , Internet Explorer , and then technologically and contractually tied Internet Explorer to its monopoly Windows operating system .
62
To ensure that only Internet Explorer ran well on Windows , Microsoft designed Windows , as its then - Vice President Brad Chase wrote , to make " running any other browser a jolting experience .
"
63
To ensure that Internet Explorer had exclusive access to the primary browser distribution channels , Microsoft also used an extensive set of exclusive - dealing contracts with OEMs , independent software vendors ( " ISVs " ) , Apple , and others .
64
Microsoft was very aggressive in its campaign to shut Netscape out of all major distribution channels .
For example , when Apple resisted distributing Microsoft 's Internet Explorer web browser with its Mac OS operating system , Microsoft threatened to stop supplying Microsoft Office for Mac OS.65
As the district court found , " ninety percent of Mac OS users running a suite of office productivity applications [ used ]
Microsoft 's Mac Office .
In 1997 , Apple 's business was in steep decline ....
Had Microsoft announced in the midst of this atmosphere that it was ceasing to develop new versions of Mac Office , a great number of ISVs ,
11
The importance of Office to Apple did not go unnoticed by Microsoft .
As Microsoft 's then - program manager for Windows , Ben Waldman , explained in an email to Bill Gates and then - CFO Greg Maffei : " The threat to cancel Mac Office 97 is certainly the strongest bargaining point we have , as doing so will do a great deal of harm to Apple immediately .
"
67 Or , as one Microsoft Vice President put it in an email to Ben Waldman , " MacOffice is the perfect club to use " to persuade Apple to " materially disadvantage [ ]
Netscape .
" 68 Apple capitulated and began pre-installing Internet Explorer as the default ( and exclusive ) browser on Mac machines .
Apple even agreed to push its own employees to use Internet Explorer .
69
Once Microsoft had achieved wide distribution for its own browser through these tactics , it then moved to " extend " ( in effect , customize ) industry standards for HyperText Markup Language ( " HTML " ) and Cascading StyleSheets ( " CSS " ) to ensure that users would become reliant on Microsoft 's own web browser .70 Microsoft also introduced its ActiveX technology extensions , which allowed software written much like traditional computer programs to run in the Internet Explorer browser , but that only worked on Microsoft 's monopoly operating system .
71
As shown in the graphic below , Microsoft 's campaign was highly successful .

Microsoft's Attempts To Extinguish Java
" Kill cross- platform Java by grow[ing ] the polluted Java market . "
--MicrosoftVJ98 SKUs and Pricing Proposal78
" [ W ]e should just quietly grow j++ share and assume that people will take more
advantage of our classes without ever realizing they are building win32 - only java
apps . "
-- Microsoft's Thomas Reardon79
In 1996 , Microsoft turned its attention to Sun Microsystems ' Java middleware technologies as another nascent threat to its operating system monopoly .
80 Sun Microsystems was at the time promoting its Java technologies with the slogan , " Write - once - run - anywhere " to illustrate the cross- platform benefits of writing Java applications .
81
Microsoft immediately recognized Java as middleware and moved to eliminate this threat .
As usual , Microsoft first embraced Java by licensing the technology from Sun Microsystems and investing in building its own Java - related developer tools .
82 Microsoft then
14
Microsoft also used exclusive agreements to promote its " polluted " version of Java and , as noted above , Microsoft threatened Intel to stop Intel from supporting Sun Microsystems ' Java standards .86
As the D.C. Circuit later explained , " Microsoft 's Paul Maritz told a senior Intel executive that Intel 's [ development of software that was compatible with ]
Sun 's Java standards was as inimical to Microsoft as Microsoft 's support for non-Intel microprocessors would be to Intel ....
Microsoft threatened
Intel that if it did not stop aiding Sun on the multimedia front , then Microsoft would refuse to distribute Intel technologies bundled with Windows .
" 87 Intel capitulated , and dropped its support for Java .
Microsoft 's overall plan to neutralize Java as a middleware threat was extremely successful .
88
As the Fourth Circuit explained in a subsequent private suit brought by Sun Microsystems :
First , Microsoft " embraced " the Java technology by licensing from Sun the right to use its Java Technology to develop and distribute compatible Products .
Second , Microsoft " extended " the Java platform by developing strategic incompatibilities into its Java runtime and development tools products ....
Third , Microsoft used its distribution channels to flood the market with its version of the Java Technology in [ what Sun characterized as ] an attempt to " hijack the Java Technology and transform it into a Microsoft proprietary programming and runtime environment .
"

15
RealNetworks " is like Netscape .
The only difference is we have a chance to start
this battle earlier in the game . "
-- Robert Muglia , Microsoft Senior Vice - President90
In 1997 , Microsoft recognized that media players also represented a nascent threat to its profitable operating system monopoly .
Like web browsers , media players are middleware products that expose APIs to software developers .
91
Fearing that media players might come to support multimedia applications on any operating system , Microsoft took action to eliminate the threat .
Consistent with its previous tactics , Microsoft first embraced the leading media player software , designed by RealNetworks , announcing an agreement to collaborate in streaming media .
92
The agreement encouraged RealNetworks to make its media player Windows - dependent in return for compensation from Microsoft.93 As Robert Muglia informed RealNetworks ' Chief Operating Officer , " anyone who competed against [ Microsoft ] in the operating system ' lost . '" 94 When RealNetworks continued to compete against Microsoft,95 however , Microsoft became increasingly aggressive in its actions .
In particular , as it had done with the browser , Microsoft tied its own media player to Windows.96
RealPlayer was , however , not the only multimedia threat to Microsoft .
Microsoft took separate action to eliminate another competitor in the multimedia space , Burst.com , Inc .
16
When Microsoft first began bundling Windows Media Player with its monopoly operating system , Microsoft also released a version of its media player for Apple 's Mac operating system .
During the period when Windows Media Player was competing with RealPlayer and Apple QuickTime , Microsoft frequently released new versions of its product for the Mac .
By 2003 , however , Microsoft had gained the upper hand , capturing more users than

J. Microsoft's Campaign Against Rival Server Operating Systems
" Sun , Oracle and Netscape are all pushing a new model of [ almost ] centralized
computing .
They all acknowledge that Microsoft holds tremendous sway over the
desktop platform , so they all want to quickly strip as much value and spending as
possible off the desktop and onto the server where they can charge premium
prices and push their own platform offerings . "
-- Aaron Contorer , Microsoft C++ General Manager107
What we are trying to do is use our server control to do new protocols and lock
out Sun and Oracle specifically "
-- Bill Gates , Microsoft108
In the mid to late 1990s , computer networks were growing in speed and Microsoft sensed a threat to its core operating system monopoly from more centralized , server - based computing .
Determined to head off any potential competition , Microsoft decided that it needed to add server operating systems to the " moat " surrounding its Windows operating system monopoly .
109
To gain inroads into this market , Microsoft embraced industry standards for file - and - print sharing , user management , and identity verification so that its products would be compatible with the then - prominent Unix server operating systems .
110 But as Microsoft 's server systems started to gain a foothold in the market , Microsoft quietly started to " extend " support for industry standard protocols in its Windows operating system so that Windows clients would have a better experience when connected to Microsoft 's servers .
111 Eventually , by changing its Windows personal computer operating system so that Windows computers could not fully connect to any server that did not use Microsoft 's proprietary extensions unless the users installed special
18
Microsoft 's conduct eventually drew scrutiny from the European Commission , which condemned Microsoft 's refusal to release information that would allow other server operating systems to connect to personal computers running Microsoft 's Windows operating system .
114
In a 2004 decision , the European Commission found that if Microsoft succeeded in eliminating other server operating systems as competitive threats , then innovation would be severely limited .
115 And , in fact , after releasing Windows Server 2003 to lukewarm reviews , 116 Microsoft failed to release a new server version of Windows until 2008 .
117
Even then , many reviewers noted that , despite aggressive marketing to small - and midsize - business users and a special edition of the server operating system just for these users , Microsoft had done very little to address their needs , and instead had essentially re-packaged a scaled - down version of an existing enterprise - level product .
118
III .
MICROSOFT CONTINUES TO ENGAGE IN ANTICOMPETITIVE CONDUCT
Despite international scrutiny of Microsoft 's anticompetitive conduct , Microsoft has continued to take similar unlawful actions to eliminate potential competitive threats .
The only real difference between Microsoft 's more recent practices and its earlier ones is that , as Mr. Gates predicted , Microsoft has now changed its document retention practices .
119
19
Microsoft's Failure To Comply With The Final Judgment
In 2003 , the DOJ discovered that Microsoft had built a feature into Windows that invoked Microsoft 's Internet Explorer browser , rather than the user 's chosen default browser , contrary to the clear obligations of the Final Judgment .
120 Similarly , in 2004 , Microsoft attempted to require licensees of its middleware offering , the .NET Framework , to obtain Microsoft 's prior consent before publishing any benchmark testing results for the software .
121 In 2005 , Microsoft demanded that manufacturers of portable music players sign exclusive deals if they wanted integration with Microsoft 's Windows Media Player .
122
And in 2007 , Microsoft made changes to allow consumers limited choice of desktop search products in Windows Vista only following an extensive government investigation and pressure from a number of U.S. States .
While Microsoft eventually made changes to its conduct in each of these instances , these incidents all demonstrate Microsoft 's willingness to use its monopoly products aggressively first and make changes later only when confronted about its behavior .
This is particularly striking coming , as it does , within the very limited range of issues covered by the Final Judgment .
123
In fact , the district court overseeing the Final Judgment extended the decree for two more years , to November 12 , 2009 , because Microsoft still has not come into compliance with its obligations regarding communications protocols .

B. Microsoft's Campaign of Patent FUD against Linux and Open Source Software
" This is not a case of some accidental , unknowing infringement .
There is an
overwhelming number of patents being infringed . "
-- Microsoft General Counsel and Intellectual Property and Licensing Vice
President Horacio Gutierrez 128
The open source Linux operating system is the principal rival to Microsoft Windows .
Linux has been taken up by both corporate customers and , increasingly , by private individuals
21
Consistent with its behavior in response to other competitive threats , Microsoft has used unfair and anti-competitive tactics to try and slow the uptake of Linux .
In particular , Microsoft has made and continues to make broad , unsubstantiated claims that software developers distributing Linux or other open source software , as well as their customers , are infringing Microsoft 's patents .
130 However , although Microsoft has claimed that as many as 235 patents may have been infringed 131 , it has consistently failed to identify which patents are at issue .
Microsoft 's tactic is to spread fear , uncertainty and doubt ( " FUD " ) as to whether developers and users of open source software may be the target of future patent infringement suits , and thereby chill consumer enthusiasm and demand for Linux and open source solutions .
Indeed , Microsoft 's unwarranted threats have brought such pressure to bear on Linux users that some have felt compelled to enter into royalty - bearing patent licenses with Microsoft .
132 Microsoft 's campaign of FUD effectively works to impose a " tax " on the use of the most viable alternative software to Windows : faced with an intimidating and powerful potential litigant known for its hardball tactics , Linux users are driven to pay the licensing fee despite the speculative nature of the IP claims .
Microsoft 's bullying tactics therefore raise the overall cost and slow down market penetration by innovative technologies intended to compete with Microsoft 's monopoly products .
Moreover , there is a strong likelihood that Microsoft 's patent FUD campaign may be unfounded in law .
Recent U.S. jurisprudence clarifies that the scope for patenting business methods , which lie at the heart of many software patents , is much narrower than was previously thought to be the case .
133
In addition , one of the thresholds for patentability that an invention is not obvious to a person skilled in the art has recently become harder to meet .
134 As such , many of the patents held by Microsoft are likely to be of questionable validity today .
Furthermore , given the myriad of software patents in existence , consumers may often be unable to determine with certainty whether their use or distribution of certain software products actually infringes another company 's IP rights .
Therefore , contrary to the broad and categorical statements of Mr. Gutierrez as to the intentional nature of any alleged patent infringements , it is widely recognized in the industry that , regardless of whether proprietary or open source software is used , there is a
22
In an apparent escalation of its patent FUD strategy , Microsoft sued the navigational system vendor , TomTom , for patent infringement at the end of February 2009 .
Three patent claims related to Linux are included in the lawsuit .
135
At least two of them are related to highly questionable patents on long file name support in Windows , which have been partially invalidated by an EC patent court on the grounds that Microsoft 's patent claims were " not based on inventive activity " .
136 While Microsoft has publicly claimed that its action is not directed against Linux or open source , and the case was settled in March 2009 pursuant to a mostly - confidential agreement , this represents an aggressive development of Microsoft 's use of spurious or highly questionable patent claims to intimidate and eliminate competition from Linux in order to maintain or strengthen its dominant position in the OS market .
C. Microsoft's Ongoing Misconduct Has Sparked Further European
Commission Investigations
As noted at the outset , the European Commission ( " EC " ) is also investigating ongoing misconduct by Microsoft , culminating in its issuance of a Statement of Objections to Microsoft on January 15 , 2009 , concerning the tying of the Internet Explorer web browser to the Windows operating system .
137
In addition , the EC continues to investigate a number of other actions Microsoft has taken to tie products to Windows as well as Microsoft 's refusal to enable interoperability with certain of its monopoly technologies , including Sharepoint , Outlook , Exchange , and Office .
138 The EC is also investigating Microsoft 's actions to manipulate the vote of the International Organization for Standardization / International Electrotechnical Commission on the recent standardization of Office " Open " XML ( " OOXML " ) .
As reported widely in the press and on the Internet , Microsoft 's manipulation of the standards setting process in favor of OOXML included financial inducements , threats , misleading information , and committee - stuffing .
139
These investigations are compelling examples of Microsoft 's continued misconduct related to its monopolies in operating systems and other products .
23
Although Microsoft has repeatedly promised to support open standards , both with its recent " Interoperability Principles " 140 and its announcements for Internet Explorer 8,141 Microsoft has routinely made similar promises of standards support in the past without fulfilling them .
142
As a result , many observers have greeted Microsoft 's various announcements and orchestrated fanfare with skepticism .
For example , following one recent Microsoft interoperability announcement , the European Commission released a short statement noting that Microsoft 's promise of interoperability followed " at least four similar statements by Microsoft in the past on the importance of interoperability .
" 143 As the Commission observed , it took Microsoft three years even to approach releasing the amount of interoperability information the European Court of First Instance had ordered it to release .
144
Even when Microsoft claims to be implementing a standard , the reality is that Microsoft 's implementations routinely either only partially conform or else somehow extend the standard , so that software developed to work with Microsoft 's version of the standard will not work with other vendors ' implementations of the same standard .
As just one example , Microsoft recently announced that Internet Explorer 8 would support a feature called " local storage , " which allows websites to store a limited amount of data on users ' computers so that users can interact with those sites offline , a feature that could help web applications become effective replacements for traditional desktop applications .
145 This feature is part of HTML 5 , the next version of the
24
V. MICROSOFT'S MONOPOLIES HAVE HARMED CONSUMERS
Microsoft 's conduct has allowed it to protect its monopolies , which has led to a lack of choice , higher prices , and less innovation than would otherwise have prevailed in a competitive marketplace .
The barriers to entry surrounding Microsoft 's core monopolies remain very high , and Microsoft 's market shares and profit margins in desktop operating systems , office productivity suites , and browsers have continued to reflect its overwhelming monopoly power in these markets .
148 In short , Microsoft 's misconduct has harmed and continues to harm consumers significantly .
A. Microsoft's Operating System Monopoly Has Harmed Consumers
For fifteen years , Microsoft 's share of desktop operating systems has remained above 90 % .
In 2002 , when the Final Judgment in United States v. Microsoft was entered , Windows XP was the most common desktop operating system .
Microsoft did not release a successor to Windows XP until 2007 , when it released Windows Vista .
Even then , the " Vista " that
25
The Windows API is ... so deeply embedded in the source code of many Windows apps that there is a huge switching cost to using a different operating system instead .
...
It is this switching cost that has given customers the patience to stick with Windows through all our mistakes , our buggy drivers , our high TCO , our lack of a sexy vision at times , and many other difficulties ...
Customers constantly evaluate other desktop platforms , [ but ] it would be so much work to move over that they hope we just improve Windows rather than force them to move .
In short , without this exclusive franchise called the Windows API , we would have been dead a long time ago .
154
Microsoft 's tactics to prolong its operating system monopoly through means other than competition on the merits go hand - in - hand with its admitted lack of innovation .
B. Microsoft's Office Monopoly Has Harmed Consumers
Microsoft 's Office suite likewise maintains a 95 % market share .
155 The standard Office suite includes Word ( word processing software ) , Excel ( spreadsheets ) , PowerPoint
26
Microsoft 's monopoly power in office productivity applications has , likewise , bred complacency that is harmful to consumers .
Even Microsoft 's founder and former Chief Software Architect , Bill Gates , asserts that the only real competitive pressure on Microsoft to improve Office today is that consumers might not upgrade to the next version .
160 Between 1997 and 2007 , Microsoft released only three new versions of Microsoft Office , a very slow pace by software industry standards , and reviewers noted that each release offered only small improvements over the previous ones .
161 It was not until 2007 , with the advent of competing
27
C. Microsoft's Web Browser Monopoly Has Harmed Consumers
For the past decade , Microsoft has maintained a dominant share in the web browser market .
164 Since Microsoft 's success in exterminating Netscape , however , it has invested little in developing its Internet Explorer web browser .
During Microsoft 's push to destroy Netscape , it released four major new versions of Internet Explorer in two years .
165
But after it successfully excluded Netscape from the market , Microsoft slowed browser development , releasing only two new versions between 1998 and 2001 , neither of which was a major upgrade .
166 After 2001 ,
28
The Web browser is probably the most frequently used category of software in the world .
But in recent years , the browser most people rely on -- Microsoft 's Internet Explorer - - has been stagnant , offering very few new features .
This is a common pattern with Microsoft .
The company is aggressive about improving its software when it first enters a market .
But once it crushes its competitors and establishes an effective monopoly , as it has in Web browsers , Microsoft seems to switch off significant innovation .
170
29
Microsoft 's anticompetitive conduct in the browser market has also firmly entrenched Internet Explorer as the super - dominant web browser in the workplace .
Among other things , during the years after Microsoft exterminated Netscape and before Firefox came on the scene , many corporate information technology departments built applications and company intranets on
30
VI . CONCLUSION
Microsoft 's conduct over the last two decades has demonstrated Microsoft 's willingness and ability to engage in unlawful conduct to protect and extend its core monopolies .
This conduct has caused real harm to consumers , who continue to pay high prices and use lower quality products than would have prevailed in a competitive market .
By understanding Microsoft 's history of anticompetitive conduct , developers , consumer groups , and government authorities will be better equipped to recognize current and future Microsoft misconduct at an early stage and intervene to prevent Microsoft from using tactics other than competition on the merits .
ECIS remains hopeful that the European Commission 's latest Statement of Objections addressing Microsoft 's misconduct will finally mark the beginning of the end of Microsoft 's two decades of anticompetitive behavior and consumer harm .

Are you all for Obama ’s economic plans ?
Do you think that bailing out failing companies , and throwing trillions into the national money pit , is just the ticket for stimulating the economy back to recovery ?
Then you might get the chance to put your money where your ideological convictions are .
The Obama administration is cajoling investment companies to create bailout bonds .
These would be similar to the bonds that wartime presidents created to find sucker - investors for their wars .
Americans were browbeaten into buying them as a patriotic duty .
So too those who say “ yes , we can ” to the bailouts will be asked to do their patriotic duty , and buy the debt of loser companies .
It ’s all part of the war on depression , which is destined to be as successful as the war on drugs .
But , hey , if it is a good investment , why not buy bailout bonds ?
Well , there ’s a problem .
The bonds represent credit extended to companies and projects that are proven market failures .
Creating these bonds is a way of institutionalizing the principle of buying low and selling lower .
So why would anyone do it ?
Well , an article in the New York Times says it is a good deal because the bonds represent underpriced assets .
The economy will recover and the mortgages with them .
“ If all goes well , the funds will eventually sell the investments at a profit . ”
Catch that ?
“ If all goes well … ”
If all goes well , I can leap out my window and fly to the moon and be back by lunch .
Here is a tip for understanding market economics .
When you hear that something is overpriced or underpriced , these comments are always and everywhere without exception a speculation .
The prices that exist right now , in any market , are precisely the right prices that need to exist .
If there were certainty that a price should be higher or a price should be lower , the price would already be higher or lower .
That is because investors are always looking for a sure thing , and the reality of a certain future is always bid back to the present , with a premium embedded for the cost of time transfer .
In the absence of price controls , you can trust that today ’s prices embody the existing conventional wisdom , which is pretty good most of the time , and certainly not something a journalist is in a position to second guess .
On the other hand , maybe you are an entrepreneur who can outwit the conventional wisdom .
That is your profession and your means of income .
It is your job to give history a shove forward .
But here is the problem .
If an entrepreneur believes that these mortgages and other “ toxic assets ” are underpriced , he does n’t need a special bond to act on his hunch .
He can just buy the stocks of the companies holding the assets or he can go one better and buy the assets themselves .
What does the creation of a new bond do ?
It is there as a subterfuge , something to pull the wool over your eyes , with the wool made of fancy financial language that masks a very grim reality .
But now comes the billion - dollar question .
How will these bonds be rated ?
If market conditions prevail , there is no reason for the bailout bonds to be rated any higher than the toxic assets that back them .
If I have a mud pie and wrap it in mud , it does n’t become edible .
It becomes more of the same .
Thus do we come to the most important aspect of the bailout bonds , which is not being publicly discussed , namely who is going to back them ?
The answer is you and your money , which is also called the “ full faith and credit of the U.S. government . ”
The bonds will be backed by the usual way that the government gets money , which is to tax it or inflate it away .
In this case , the bonds will indeed achieve a higher rating than they otherwise would , in precisely the same way that the Fannie and Freddie financial instruments backed by mortgages received a higher rating than they otherwise would , because the government was implicitly backing them .
In other words , this entire tactic is an extension of the exact path that got us into this mess in the first place !
So it is with every new plan , every new strategy , every new program , every new idea from the regime .
They are all some variation on a theme that repeats the mistakes of the past .
It ’s like a person who bumps into a wall , and keeps bumping into the wall again and again .
Every new plan for going forward keeps coming back to the same reality of bumping into the wall .
What would we say about this person ?
We would say he is obtuse and refuses to learn from his mistakes .
So it is with all government programs that have been put in place since this crisis began .
They are the very embodiment of what it means to not learn from past error .
If private markets have learned from past mistakes , they will stay away from these bonds .
They will freely tell others not to buy them either .
But then what happens , especially as the depression deepens ?
In the First World War , such people were sent to jail .
That tended to have a chilling effect on open discussion of the subject .
Will Obama try such tactics ?
Surely this great humanitarian will not resort to fining and jailing people for not supporting his war effort .
Or can he really go to such lengths ?
If history is our guide , the answer is : Yes He Can .

Shortly after 1:30 on the afternoon of March 18 , two dozen traders in AIG ’s financial - products division stepped away from their Bloomberg terminals and huddled around televisions to watch their boss , CEO Edward Liddy , testify before Congress .
There was much at stake .
These were the people who received the greater part of $ 165 million in “ retention bonuses ” that had suddenly become , to borrow a phrase , toxic .
As the hue and cry to return the money grew , the traders had thought that Liddy would stand up for them .
The ruddy - faced , 63 - year - old former Allstate CEO , who had been installed by Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson in September , was , if not exactly one of them , at least someone who understood the rules of the game as it had been played — and who understood what they were entitled to under those rules , even if those rules were unspoken .
In AIG ’s glory years , executives like Joseph Cassano , the former head of financial products , took home more than $ 300 million .
That was the kind of money you could n’t talk about .
But as Andrew Cuomo stoked public outrage by threatening to release the names of the bonus recipients , it became clear that the game was changing .
When AIG employees had arrived at their desks that morning , they found a memo from Liddy asking them to return 50 percent of the money .
The number infuriated many of the traders .
Why 50 percent ?
It seemed to be picked out of a hat .
The money had been promised , was the feeling .
A sacred principle was at stake , along with , not incidentally , their millions .
Everyone on Wall Street is prepared to lose money .
Bankers have expressions for disastrous losses : clusterfuck , Chernobyl , blowing up …
But no one was prepared to lose money this way .
This felt like getting mugged .
Jake DeSantis , a 40 - year - old commodities trader at AIG , was an unlikely face of Wall Street greed .
Stocky and clean cut , with an abiding moral streak , he ’d worked summers for a bricklayer in the shadow of shuttered steel mills outside Pittsburgh ; he was valedictorian of his high - school class and attended college at MIT .
Compared with the way many of his Wall Street brethren lived , with their Gulfstreams , Hamptons mansions , and fleets of luxury cars , his life was n’t one to invite scorn .
He had canvassed for Obama in Scranton on Election Day and drove a Prius .
His division at AIG was profitable .
And since joining the company in 1998 , he had never traded a single credit - default swap .
Now his boss was selling him out .
DeSantis left work that day feeling that his world was falling apart .
The next day , the House passed — by a wide margin — a bill that would levy a 90 percent tax on bonuses at firms that were bailed out .
The Connecticut Working Families Party planned to bus protesters to the homes of AIG executives in Fairfield County .
There were death threats .
“ It ’s been terrifying , ” says his wife ’s mother , Lynnette Baughman .
“ It ’s like a witch hunt . ”
It was in this environment that DeSantis sent his remarkable resignation letter to the New York Times .
In the letter , which ran as an op -ed on March 25 , he compared himself to a plumber ( “ None of us should be cheated of our payments any more than a plumber should be cheated after he has fixed the pipes but a careless electrician causes a fire that burns down the house ” ) and announced that he would quit AIG and donate his bonus to charity .
The letter , passionate and wounded and oddly out of touch with ordinary Americans , put a human face on Wall Street ’s anger .
When DeSantis arrived at the office the morning his letter appeared in the paper , the AIG traders gave him a standing ovation .
In some quarters of the press , he was vilified .
( As Frank Rich put it in the Times , “ He did n’t seem to understand that his … $ 742,006.40 ( net ) would have amounted to $ 0 had American taxpayers not ponied up more than $ 170 billion to keep AIG from dying . ” )
But the fracas was useful : DeSantis had succeeded in opening up an honest conversation — as typically emotional and awkward and neurotically charged as is any conversation on the subject — about money , the first this town has had in years .
In a witch hunt , the witches have feelings , too .
As populist rage has erupted around the country , stoked by canny politicians , an opposite rage has built on Wall Street and other arenas where the wealthy hold sway .
Its expression is more furtive and it ’s often mixed with a kind of sublimated shame , but it can be every bit as vitriolic .
“ AIG pissed some people off , and now you ’re gonna screw everyone on Wall Street ? ” rails a laid - off JPMorgan vice - president .
( Despite the honesty of the conversation , many did not wish to be quoted by name . )
“ No offense to Middle America , but if someone went to Columbia or Wharton , [ even if ] their company is a fumbling , mismanaged bank , why should they all of a sudden be paid the same as the guy down the block who delivers restaurant supplies for Sysco out of a huge , shiny truck ? ” e-mails an irate Citigroup executive to a colleague .
“ I ’m not giving to charity this year ! ” one hedge - fund analyst shouts into the phone , when I ask about Obama ’s planned tax increases .
“ When people ask me for money , I tell them , ‘ If you want me to give you money , send a letter to my senator asking for my taxes to be lowered . ’
I feel so much less generous right now .
If I have to adopt twenty poor families , I want a thank - you note and an update on their lives .
At least Sally Struthers gives you an update . ”
It is difficult to sympathize with these people , their comments laced with snobbery and petulance .
But you can understand their shock :
Their world has been turned on its head .
After years of enjoying favorable tax rates , they are facing an administration that wants to redistribute their wealth .
Their industry is being reordered — no one knows what Wall Street will look like in a few years .
They are anxious , and their anxiety is making them mad .
Their anger takes many forms :
There is rage at Obama for pushing to raise taxes ( “ The government wants me to be a slave ! ” says one hedge - fund analyst ) ; rage at the masses who do n’t understand that Wall Street ’s high salaries fund New York ’s budget ( “ We ’re fucked , ” says a former Lehman equities analyst , referring to the city ) ; rage at the people who do n’t “ get ” that Wall Street enables much of the rest of the economy to function ( “ JPMorgan and all these guys should go on strike — see what happens to the country without Wall Street , ” says another hedge - funder ) .
“ The market determines what people are worth .
Did I think I was overpaid ?
You betcha .
But a lot of people are overpaid . ”
A few weeks ago , I had drinks with a friend who used to work at Lehman Brothers .
She had come to Wall Street in the mid-eighties , when the junk - bond boom spawned a new class of globe - trotting financiers .
Over two decades , she had done stints at all the major banks —
Chase , Goldman , Lehman — and had a thriving career directing giant streams of capital around the world and extracting a substantial percentage for herself .
To her mind , extreme compensation is a fair trade for the compromises of such a career .
“ People just do n’t get it , ” she says .
“ I ’m attached to my BlackBerry .
I was at my doctor the other day , and my doctor said to me , ‘ You know , I like that when I leave the office , I leave . ’
I get calls at two in the morning , when the market moves .
That costs money .
If they keep compensation capped , I do n’t know how the deals get done .
They ’re taking Wall Street and throwing it in the East River . ”
Now , a lot of people in New York have BlackBerrys , and few of them expect to be paid $ 2 million to check their e-mail in the middle of the night .
But embedded in her comment is the belief shared on Wall Street but which few have dared to articulate until now :
Those who select careers in finance play an exceptional role in our society .
They distribute capital to where it ’s most effective , and by some Ayn Rand–ian logic , the virtue of efficient markets distributing capital to where it is most needed justifies extreme salaries — these are the wages of the meritocracy .
They see themselves as the fighter pilots of capitalism .
Wall Street people are not moral idiots ( most of them , anyway ) — it ’s not as if they ’ve never pondered the fairness of their enormous salaries .
“ One of my relatives is a doctor , we ’re both well - educated , hardworking people .
And he certainly did n’t make the amount of money I made , ” a former Bear Stearns senior managing director tells me .
“ I would be the first person to tell you his value to society , to humanity , is far greater than anything that went on in the Bear Stearns building . ”
That said , he continues , “ We ’re in a hypercapitalistic society .
No one complains when Julia Roberts pulls down $ 25 million per movie or A - Rod has a $ 300 million guarantee .
We have ex-presidents who cash in on their presidencies .
Our whole moral compass has shifted about what ’s acceptable or not acceptable .
Honestly , you can pick on Wall Street all you want , I do n’t think it ’s fair .
It ’s fair to say you ran your companies into the ground , your risk management is flawed — that is perfectly legitimate .
You can lay criticism on GM or others .
But I do n’t think it ’s fair to say Wall Street is paid too much . ”
Of course , it is precisely the flawed risk management that has brought Wall Street salaries under scrutiny .
No one has ever been hurt — not financially , anyway — by a Julia Roberts movie .
But with their jobs in jeopardy and their 401 ( k ) s in the toilet thanks to a market in which banks took risks with great upside and seemingly little downside , the Minions of the Universe are looking at the Masters with a newly skeptical eye .
“ There ’s this perception that the people on the Street were making money for nothing , ” says a mortgage - investment banker .
“ You have a political and media class who make the mortgage originators and bankers out to be the villains .
But are they ?
They were doing what Congress wanted them to do .
Is the guy who lied on his mortgage application the victim here ?
This whole narrative that the downtrodden were the victims and the money guys were the perpetrators really does n’t stand up to rational challenge . ”
But the issue of pay is hardly ever discussed rationally .
“ Compensation gets so emotional , ” says the Bear Stearns managing director .
“ Everyone has a point of view .
The truth is , the market determines what people are worth .
Did I think I was overpaid ?
You betcha .
But a lot of people are overpaid . ”
The fault line in the argument over compensation is whether the last 30 years of wealth accumulation are part of the natural order of the economy , to be tampered with at the nation ’s peril , or an aberration — a giddy , delirious break from reality in which eight - figure bonuses were considered normal .
For those who spent their entire careers in the boom , the natural order of things looked something like this :
Newly minted Ivy League graduates flocked to the city to position themselves close to the ever - expanding capital pie and collect the seven - figure crumbs .
In return , they joined charity boards , donated to philanthropic causes , booked reservations at restaurants , bought art , kept the waiters and artists and chefs employed , and , yes , paid taxes that cleaned up the city .
Consumption and benevolence merged into an enlightened , if garish , form of economic organization .
The noblesse oblige was trickle - down .
Now they were feeling shamed .
“ You wear a nice suit on the subway , and people look at you . ”
As Washington denuded the regulations that had constrained finance , the banks themselves encouraged their employees to pursue maximum risk .
Bonuses were paid based largely on short - term profits .
“ It was the culture of what some called IBG - YBG : I ’ll be gone , you ’ll be gone , ” says Jonathan Knee , a senior managing director at Evercore Partners .
Wall Street championed the ethos of “ Eat what you kill . ”
The most aggressive employees , those who took the greatest risks , thought of themselves less as members of a firm and more as independent contractors entitled to their share of the profits .
In this system , institutions tended to be hostage to their best employees .
“ The feeling is , if people do n’t get compensated adequately , they ’re going to go out and do this on their own , ” says Alan Patricof , who founded the private - equity firm Apax Partners .
For these people , it is difficult to imagine a world in which they are not at the top of the socioeconomic heap .
But a number of economists and academics are arguing that it was not always this way , and that what we ’re seeing now is “ a return to normalcy , ” as Mitchell Moss , a professor of urban policy and planning at NYU , puts it .
Until the late seventies , banking was a career choice more akin to being a corporate lawyer or a doctor than a high - flying hedge - fund manager .
Until the eighties , Wall Street counted for about 20 percent of all corporate profits in America , but by the peak of the bubble , it had grown to an astounding 41 percent .
“ Wall Street became a high - margin business because of the deregulated environment , ” Moss says .
“ You basically had a casino culture operating in the financial - services industry . ”
And that huge profitability led to great influence .
“ The system as a whole became unstable because Wall Street developed this disproportionate influence .
It ’s an entire system of belief they had to create , ” says Simon Johnson , the former chief economist of the IMF .
In a recent Atlantic article , Johnson describes Wall Street ’s influence as a ruling oligarchy , not dissimilar to those of the crony capitalists that have controlled the levers of power in places like Russia , Argentina , and Indonesia .
The solution , according to people like Paul Krugman , is to make banking regulated , less profitable , and “ boring ” again .
It should come as no surprise that being a banker — indeed , simply being rich — is going to be a lot less fun under an Obama administration .
In winter 2007 , as the Democratic - primary contest got under way , Obama showed up at a Goldman Sachs client meeting to explain his economic agenda to a conference room full of potential campaign contributors .
When he opened up the session to questions from the audience , one attendee lobbed the question that was surely on the mind of everyone in the room .
“ Are you going to raise my taxes ? ”

Obama looked out across the millionaires sitting around him .
“ Yes , ” he answered , without a flicker of hesitation , according to a person familiar with the meeting .
During the campaign , Obama was never shy about his promise to undo the Bush tax policies .
But it was easy to ignore his occasional lapses into populist rhetoric and focus on his intense intelligence and Ivy League education .
Now , in the wake of the crisis , Wall Street ’s politics are shifting rightward .
“ All the rich people I know took George Bush for granted , ” says an analyst at a midtown hedge fund .
“ I ’m a Democrat , but I agree with Rush Limbaugh on a lot of this stuff , ” rails the wife of a former AIG executive .
The anger masks a deeper suspicion that Obama fundamentally does n’t respect their place at the table .
“ I think he does n’t have an appreciation for how hard it is to build these companies , the blood , sweat , and tears that goes into them , ” says a senior executive from a failed Wall Street firm .
“ It ’s just that he has no passion for it .
He speaks dispassionately about the whole situation , except when he ’s beating up on the Wall Street fat cats . ”
The argument that Obama has in fact done a great deal to help Wall Street — to the tune of trillions of dollars — does n’t have much truck with these critics .
“ If you really take a look at what Obama is promising , it ’s frightening , ” says Nicholas Cacciola , a 44 - year - old executive at a financial - services firm .
“ He ’s punishing you for doing better .
He does n’t want to have any wealth creation — it ’s wealth distribution .
Why are you being punished for making a lot of money ? ”
As a Republican corporate lawyer puts it : “ It ’s the politics of envy , and that ’s very dangerous . ”
“ Nobody likes having their taxes go up , ” says Whitney Tilson , who runs the investment firm T2 Partners and was a member of Obama ’s Tri-State Finance Committee .
This was a view that was comically on display at the scores of anti-tax “ tea parties ” that took place across the country last week .
“ Rich Democrats do n’t like having their taxes raised either …
Naturally , when you try and take the bone away , even if they did n’t deserve that bone in the first place , nothing starts a fight more than raising taxes . ”
The crisis seems to have exposed a generation gap on Wall Street .
For a bit of perspective , I spoke with a Goldman veteran who had left years ago to run his own private - equity firm .
He ’s 55 , which is old by Wall Street standards — at some firms , if you ’re not upper management , you ’re encouraged to get out , with your substantial nest egg , by 50 .
He had arrived on Wall Street in 1980 , on the eve of the junk - bond mania , and watched how radically his peers changed the city .
“ When I started , people made a lot of money , but it was an order of magnitude less than what people made from 1995 to 2005 .
You know , some of my friends and I , we complained bitterly that we had bad luck that we started when we did .
We said , ‘ Gee , I wish we had graduated from school in 1990 , not 1980 . ’
We thought we’d be making a hell of a lot more money .
And now , the guys who graduated from school in 2005 , arguably those guys wo n’t make very much money at all .
So the truth is , when you hit Wall Street determines in large part whether or not you ’re wealthy . ”
To Wall Street people who have grown up in the bubble , the meaning of the crisis is only slowly sinking in .
They ca n’t yet grasp the idea of a life lived on less .
“ Without exception , Wall Street guys have gotten accustomed to not being stuck in the city in August .
So it becomes a right to have a summer home within an hour or two commute from Manhattan , ” says the Goldman vet .
“ There ’s a cost structure of going with your family on summer vacation that ’s not optional .
There ’s a cost structure of spending $ 40,000 to send your kids to private school that is not optional .
There ’s a sense of entitlement , that you need that amount of money just to live , that ’s not optional . ”
“ You ca n’t live in New York and have kids and send them to school on $ 75,000 , ” he continues .
“ And you have the Obama administration suggesting that .
That was a very populist thing that Obama said .
He ’s being disingenuous .
He knows that you ca n’t live in New York on $ 75,000 . ”
That was an argument I heard over and over : that the high cost of living like a wealthy person in New York necessitates high salaries .
It was loopy logic , but expressed sincerely .
“ You could make the argument that $ 250,000 is a fair amount to make , ” says the laid - off JPMorgan vice - president .
“ Well , what about the $ 125,000 that staffers on Capitol Hill make ?
They ’re making high salaries for where they live , maybe we should cut their salary , too . ”
Part of the problem , the Goldman vet explains , is that there ’s a vast divide between where the public is and where the bankers are .
The public registers how fundamentally the system has changed ; the bankers are far from getting to that point .
“ When I talked to my friends in November and December at firms like Goldman , they would tell me , ‘ If the government does n’t bail us out , we ’re going down . ’
They really thought they were going to zero , and without exception , they all forget that now , ” he says .
“ They forget that their company ’s stock was going to zero .
It ’s a state of delusion ; they do n’t remember those days .
The flip side of that is , every guy except the Goldman guy remembers that Goldman was bailed out . ”
I asked him what will happen if Congress succeeds in regulating compensation .
“ These guys will not work on Wall Street , ” he says flatly .
“ People go to Wall Street out of greed .
When I was interviewing for jobs , frequently some form of the question came up :
How much do you want to make money ?
If my answer was something like — and it was n’t — but if my answer was , ‘ I ’m here for intellectual betterment , ’ their response might have been , ‘ University is a great place for you . ’
They want people who think ‘ I ’m greedy , I want to be a billionaire . ’
That was viewed as a really good thing . ”
The greed wo n’t disappear , of course .
“ The smart people are going to make money in good times and bad times , ” one investment adviser tells me .
“ They ’ll figure out how to game the system , ” says the former Bear Stearns managing director .
“ You may get a new set of players .
This may be a movement back to partnerships and boutique firms .
This could be their moment . ”
There ’s a vast woundedness now on Wall Street , which is hard to contemplate after the period of triumphalism so recently ended .
In this conversation about money , there ’s a lot to work through .
Just months ago , the masses kept what anger they had to themselves , and the bankers were close - lipped about what they thought they were owed by society .
There was n’t much of a dialogue about the haves and have - nots and who was entitled to what .
For the privileged , it was a lot more comfortable when things remained unspoken .
Almost more than the loss of money , they are concerned with the loss of status and pride .
“ I was at a cocktail party on Friday .
Some guy said to me , ‘ You work on Wall Street ?
How ’s that working out for you ? ’ ” says the JPMorgan banker who was forced out in a recent round of layoffs .
“ There was a little bit of nastiness there . ”
It was a feeling I heard a lot as I spoke with Wall Street bankers , analysts , and traders .
They had believed Wall Street was where the winners of American capitalism went .
Now they were feeling shamed for their work .
“ You wear a nice suit on the subway , and people look at you , ” the former JPMorgan VP continues .
“ I know it ’s not wrong to be an investment banker in New York these days , but I get that feeling .
Now anyone who made money on Wall Street has done the American people wrong ? ”
Could this really be the new pecking order ?
A future where banking is boring , salaries are capped , taxes are high , and — worst of all — you get to carry the blame for the Great Recession of ’09 ?
It ’s almost too much to bear .
“ I always thought what I did was somewhat honorable , ” the mortgage - investment banker recently told me .
He had been trading Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac securities he thought were triple - A- rated investments until his fund blew up and put him out of work .
“ Suddenly , the simple fact I work on Wall Street means that I ’m a bad person ?
You know , I lost my job .
I ’m more of a victim . ”

UPDATE : 5/09/09 :
It appears our efforts have been succesful !
GLAAD is reporting that the Dr. Phil show is giving up on their search for " fake bisexuals " , atleast for now .
When GLAAD called about concerns over the show , the response was :
" We are not planning on doing a show like this right now or in May sweeps .
We are going into hiatus next week and will not be taping for a while .
We have many plugs up because we are always looking for interesting stories .
If a story like this should come to fruition we will attempt to contact you . "
The last thing they want anyone to know is that they were pressured by activists .
I truly believe it is our efforts that have led to this show not airing .
If they do try and bring up a similar show in the future , we will definitely call them out on it .
Thanks for all of your letters to " Dr " Phil McGraw .

In an upcoming show called " Teen Pretending to be Bisexual ? "
The show is asking for parents to come on the show with their sons and daughters who self identify as bi .
There are a host of problems with this proposed show .
First off , it is unreasonable and irresponsible to guess someones sexual orientation / identity .
It is offensive to assert that someone is lying about their sexual orientation , it is their own individual choice on how to self identify .
Thirdly , the show is operating on the premise that bisexuality is just a " trend " and that it is used to draw attention from males .
This program has yet to air , but it sure smells like it will be biphobic , dismissive of the bisexual orientation , and flailing stereotypes about what it means to self identify as bisexual .
Could we just be jumping to conclusions and wrongly pointing the finger at Dr. Phil ?
Check out his previous queerphobic programs on " Gender Confused Kids " Is it Wrong for a Little Boy to Wear Pink " , " Ex-gay Experts " and " Little Boy Lost Boycott Dr. Phil and let him know why by contacting him .

An examination of the program reveals that the zombie computers are programmed to try to contact a control system for instructions on April 1 .
There has been a range of speculation about the nature of the threat posed by the botnet , from a wake - up call to a devastating attack .
Researchers who have been painstakingly disassembling the Conficker code have not been able to determine where the author , or authors , is located , or whether the program is being maintained by one person or a group of hackers .
The growing suspicion is that Conficker will ultimately be a computing - for - hire scheme .
Researchers expect it will imitate the hottest fad in the computer industry , called cloud computing , in which companies like Amazon , Microsoft and Sun Microsystems sell computing as a service over the Internet .
Earlier botnets were devised so they could be split up and rented via black market schemes that are common in the Internet underground , according to security researchers .
The Conficker program is built so that after it takes up residence on infected computers , it can be programmed remotely by software to serve as a vast system for distributing spam or other malware .
Several people who have analyzed various versions of the program said Conficker ’s authors were obviously monitoring the efforts to restrict the malicious program and had repeatedly demonstrated that their skills were at the leading edge of computer technology .
For example , the Conficker worm already had been through several versions when the alliance of computer security experts seized control of 250 Internet domain names the system was planning to use to forward instructions to millions of infected computers .
Shortly thereafter , in the first week of March , the fourth known version of the program , Conficker C , expanded the number of the sites it could use to 50,000 .
That step made it virtually impossible to stop the Conficker authors from communicating with their botnet .
( Or , how naïve early - twentieth - century physicists look today ,
and how naïve we will look to twenty - second - century developers )
I ’ve always loved the popular story about how early 20th century physicists thought physics was basically “ done ” .
There were just a couple of minor phenomena lacking an explanation , and it was widely believed that they would soon be fully understood .
The whole building of physical law would be finished in a matter of years .
These “ minor phenomena ” were the photoelectric effect and the apparently constant speed of light regardless of the observer , as shown by Michelson and Morley in their famous experiment .
Of course , we now know that explaining these phenomena would give rise to relativity and quantum mechanics .
These theories questioned all previous physics , and made us start to actually see the enormous complexity of our universe : it ’s not even clear that we ’ll ever be able to fully understand it .
In some ways , I feel the computer and software industry is in a similar state .
I despair when I see this short - sighted attitude in many developers and computer scientists , despite how primitive our current understanding is .
Bill Gates is said to have lured David Cutler into leaving Digital and joining Microsoft to lead the Windows NT effort by asking “ Do n’t you want to write the last major OS kernel ? ”
Purely as a hiring move , it was obviously a great success .
But unfortunately , to many in the industry , current kernels are the last step of the road .
Ouch .
It ’s not only that it ’s wrong , but also that this belief impedes original thought and progress .
What we now have are just the first babblings of software – clumsy languages , systems and architectures , poor tools , and primitive theories , which are guaranteed to have an expiry date in the not - very - distant future .
It ’s sure we wo n’t be using the current theories and processes in a matter of a few decades .
I recently read an otherwise educated developer remark : “ parsing is basically a solved problem ” .
He probably knew about parsing , maybe even in some depth : recursive descent , LR parsing , lex and yacc and their multiple descendants …
But he must have been unable to see beyond that .
It ’s the only explanation for his affirmation , because I think nothing is further from the truth .
These are the very early days of computing .
We have just started exploring the shore of a new continent , and it ’s shocking , because many are already proclaiming that it ’s over .
But the good news is that there is plenty of unconquered territory , most of the settlers have their eyes covered , and they ’re not even attempting to grab any of it .
An Itch to Scratch
( Or , a vision , and the twisted path to its completion )
I am somewhat obsessed with visualization and user interfaces : anything that helps you better understand what you are working on , and which helps you create .
And for better or worse , all my product ideas are born from an itch I need to scratch myself .
Back in early 2005 , I thought it would be awesome to have the following visualization of code while I was editing it :
The goal was to understand at a glance the structure of the code and its control flow .
I wanted to see the name of functions and classes highlighted in their definition ( the syntax of C - derived languages is notoriously horrible in this regard , hiding the name among a lot of clutter ) .
I also wanted colored regions marking code blocks , visually grouping the code .
I wanted to be able to see where everything starts and ends , and see right away the type of each block : red for loops , green for if - blocks , and so on .
Statements that break the normal flow of a loop ( break , continue ) should stand out .
All this had to be done in real - time , inside the text editor or IDE , while the code was being edited .
You could call this advanced syntax - highlighting .
Actually , what syntax - highlighting usually refers to really is n’t such , because it does n’t use any syntactic information to color the code .
It usually just uses lexical information : the distinction between keywords , operators , numbers , constants , identifiers …
Very few tools use any syntactic information for display purposes .
And , sadly , this is not done because of a design choice , but because lexical analysis is so much simpler to do .
This feature is the kind of thing that once imagined , you ca n’t take your mind off .
At the moment , I also thought it was completely innovative , as I had n’t seen it anywhere else .
This was one of the features I decided I would include in NGEDIT , the text - editor I was working on .
There were many other foundational parts of the editor that still needed work , so I did n’t actually start implementing anything .
Some time after that , my development effort deviated a bit , as I started working in ViEmu , my vi/vim emulator for Visual Studio , Word , Outlook and SQL Server .
For ViEmu , I actually adapted the vi/vim emulation core I had written for the editor , so that it could work inside these host apps , and released it as a stand - alone product .
I focused exclusively on the ViEmu products for some time , turning them into solid , working products .
During this almost - exclusive stint in ViEmu , I stumbled into a few cases of features similar to the one I had envisioned : Jacob Thurman ’s Castalia , which implemented something similar for Delphi , DevExpress ’ CodeRush , with a similar version for Visual Studio , and also some scripts for lisp display in emacs .
They called it structural highlighting , a name I do n’t like much , but which sidesteps the mix - up with syntax - highlighting .
Still , none of them did the kind of control - flow - based color - coding I wanted , which is where it becomes really useful information .
Fast forward to early 2007 .
ViEmu sales were slow for the first few months of the year .
I was living off of this , and savings were not huge , so I decided I ’d implement another product to try and complement the lousy sales .
I had now renamed the text editor to kodumi ( a much nicer name if I can say so myself ) , and it was still work in progress .
Actually , it had turned into a major research project that would ( and will ) still take a long time to complete .
If I was going to arrive somewhere shortly , I had to tackle something more manageable .
So I did some digging in the drawer of project and feature ideas .
Among the many crazy , undoable concoctions , I came by the “ control - flow outlines ” idea .
On one hand , I still thought it was a cool feature that would really improve the visualization of code .
On the other hand , after ViEmu , I had become very familiar with extending the Visual Studio built - in editor ( short version : you ’ll have to sweat blood to make it do what you want ) .
Together with a few other useful features , it could offer a nice addition to VS .
It made sense , and it seemed to be within reach .
That would be it .
Inspired on “ kana ” , the Japanese name of reading and writing systems , I decided to call the product Codekana .
And I set out to write it .
Such a project involves many tasks .
There are core technology elements , interaction with the host application , and many more .
At the beginning of any project , I like to evaluate the difficulty of each challenge .
Adding extra elements to VS ’s text editor window was clearly doable : other add - ins were already doing it , and a quick prototype helped me prove it .
Filled background regions turned out to be nigh - impossible , due to VS ’s internal text - rendering system , but I could draw lines to represent the blocks .
This kind of hacking is never simple , or nice , but for an experienced Windows developer , it was a matter of putting in the hours .
This was not the hard part .
Even if it is a solved problem to some , it was obvious to me from the first moment what the really hard part was .
It was , of course , the parsing .
On a Whim
( Or how perfectionist thinking can sometimes get you somewhere worthwhile )
I will gloss over the difficulties of parsing C/C++ and C# , which is not an easy job .
I will also skip describing the task of implementing a responsive background parser using a multithreaded task - engine .
I will even withhold from whining about the difficulties of getting Visual Studio to do what you want .
What made everything else seem simplistic in comparison is that , unlike existing tools , I was determined to properly support the free - form editing we do while coding .
What do I mean by this ?
Have a look at the following typical editing session ( the cursor is shown in red , and newly inserted text is marked in green ) :
This session starts from a grammatically correct version of the code , and the source is gradually modified – in this case , just by typing .
The end result , on the right , is also grammatically correct .
But the intermediate version , when you have typed the new code only partially , is incorrect .
In this incorrect version , braces do n’t pair properly .
There is a new opening brace , which still does n’t have a matching closing brace .
The question here is – what should the Codekana parser do with this version of the code ?
Traditional parsing starts from the top and scans linearly .
Braces are paired according to a simple logic : a closing brace is understood to close the most recent opening brace that has n’t been matched .
This method works wonderfully in correct source code .
But if applied to the intermediate version above , the result will be a surprising .
See what pairings this scan will find ( in green ) , and what brace it will leave unmatched ( in red ) :
Of course , this source code ca n’t be fully parsed properly , as it ’s incorrect .
But the parser has detected some pairs and these could be used for display or other purposes .
The outline rendering could use the pairs , except that it ’s a key problem that the pairs it has found are wrong , they are completely different from the ones found before the typing , and they will be wrong again after the closing brace is typed .
A Codekana - like display will get very confused with this intermediate parse .
All traditional tools rescan in this naïve way .
Regular compilers of course work this way : they work in “ batch mode ” , and have far less information than any dynamic parser .
If you try to compile the above incorrect code , most compilers will just flag the function body ’s opening brace as unmatched .
And if there is another function afterwards , the error can be as obscure as “ nested function not allowed ” , given the compiler will still think we ’re inside foo ’s body ( and , technically , we are ) .
But even newer interactive - mode parsers , as the ones used by Visual Studio ’s own Intellisense , or even JetBrains Resharper ’s or DevExpress CodeRush ’s parser , will also fall into the same trap .
The technique they use for dynamic parsing is “ throw everything away and restart ” .
To avoid extra work , they probably start at the current function or near the editing point , but they do n’t go much further than that .
In the case above , some of them will even flag as incorrect all code below the editing point .
Apart from the erroneous feedback provided , the extra work of re-parsing the rest of the module twice , first when entering the opening brace , and then again when typing the closing one , is nothing to laugh about either .
Of course , they are aware of the problem : an article on Resharper ’s blog even complains about C - like languages ’ syntax when compared to Visual Basic , where delimiters such as “ End If ” , “ End Loop ” and “ End Function ” allow better parsing with little effort :
Of tools and languages .
To alleviate the problem , some of these tools help address this by automatically inserting the matching closing brace , parenthesis or bracket when the user types the opening one .
This ameliorates the issue , but it ’s not a real fix .
Other editing operation sequences can create similar situations , which can not be fixed with simple hacks .
I knew this was what usual techniques afforded , and that this was what current tools were doing .
But I had a clear idea of what I wanted to do instead : I wanted Codekana to understand the situation .
When re-parsing the code in the case above , the new opening brace should n’t pair with the next pre-existing closing brace – it is much more likely that the previous pairings persist , and so the parser should keep them .
Here is a screenshot of how I wanted Codekana to treat this case :
It ’s the new opening brace that is flagged as unpaired , and the previously existing pairings are assumed to remain valid .
Codekana also knows that the source is incorrect , but it can apply this heuristic to flag the brace that is most likely the culprit , rather than the one that the naïve linear scan would pinpoint .
The heuristic is the following : assume that it ’s the new brace that is unpaired .
This is the case most of the time , and applying this logic is the only way to give the correct information to the user .
It is also much better than what any other tool out there does .
In the general case , what I wanted was for the parser to use all the information from previous states to understand the editing better , and to better interpret any version of the code .
The simplest case of this is what is shown above : flagging the new brace as unpaired , instead of the pre-existing one .
But the lead was promising and I could envision more advanced use cases .
Code is often incorrect while it is being modified , and the developer still needs all the help he can get .
And I ’m not only talking about simple non matching - braces : when we ported Commandos 2 from the PC to the PlayStation 2 , optimizing memory usage took months , and for extended periods of time , full branches of the one - million - lines - of - C++- code codebase did n’t even compile .
Also during regular editing , the code probably spends more time in an incorrect state than in a correct one .
Being able to apply refactorings and other complex operations while the code is partially wrong can be very useful .
It ’s not only that it works , but that it ’s the right thing to do .
Enhancing the tools so they can better understand what is happening can only be a net win .
Uncharted Territory
( Or , once you know where you want to get , how you find the way there ? )
As with any spec , there are different ways to implement it .
Codekana could just try to fully reparse the module and not accept the new text fragments until the whole module parses correctly , flagging these braces as unpaired .
This would work , but it ’s an ugly hack , it would require a lot of redundant parsing , and would n’t work in all cases .
But mainly , it ’s just not the right solution – it does n’t scale to higher levels of usefulness .
I did have a look at standard research sources .
I knew , because I ’m familiar with them , that traditional books on parsing like The Dragon Book or other standard texts on compilers do n’t even get close to covering this kind of scenario .
What I was trying to do is a form of incremental parsing : reusing the previously existing parse to parse a newer version of the same source .
I had a look at what was available on incremental parsing , and found a few research initiatives , and even mentions of a few products .
But it turns out none of them was focused on the kind of problem I was trying to solve .
They were either trying to improve the performance of compile times , thus studying incremental analysis between correct versions of the code , or they were trying to study the formal mathematics of incremental parsing , which is a cool thing , but is not very practical .
Their approaches would have analyzed the above incorrect source in the naïve and wrong way , the same as current tools do , only they would take much less time to do so .
It ’s not only important that the parser re-uses existing info , but how it re-uses it .
It was clear I had to design a completely different parsing engine .
No existing techniques would be of help .
It turned out that by pursuing a clear user - oriented goal , I had deviated from what is considered standard knowledge in parsing theory and practice .
It had only taken this to get into uncharted territory .
The bad news is that opening new paths can require a lot of effort .
The good news is that this is much , much more exciting than being the thousandth implementer of an algorithm from the 70s , and potentially much more rewarding .
So , how could this thing be implemented ?
The key to designing and implementing any code is to design what data needs to be stored and how , and the operations that act on it .
None of the usual parsing techniques would work for the above case , because none were designed to understand erroneous code .
There is actually a technique called “ error productions ” , which includes common erroneous code patterns in the grammar of a parser so that the compiler can report errors properly .
But this technique does not understand the “ ephemeral ” nature of code as seen by Codekana in an editing session .
Wait , this was the key !
All current techniques deal with quite stable code , while I wanted Codekana to understand how code evolves .
Let ’s see the parsing structures alongside each version of the code :
With traditional tools , both the first and the last state of the code above have a representation as a “ parse tree ” , while the state in the middle does n’t have a parse tree , because it ’s incorrect .
The key realization was understanding that I had to extend the traditional parse tree to cover erroneous cases : a branch of the parse tree can contain an unmatched brace , that ’s all .
This never arises in traditional parsers , because they “ experience ” the code linearly .
However , a dynamic parser experiences the non-linear timeline of editing operations , and thus a new , unpaired brace can appear , and should be inserted , anywhere in the tree .
Until another brace comes later to match it , we ’ll have to live with an unmatched brace :
If a closing brace is inserted below later , both are detected to match and converted into a proper block .
This treatment extend to other cases : if the closing brace of an existing block is deleted , the opening one will be “ downgraded ” to unpaired - status , and all the remaining nested or surrounding blocks will remain properly paired .
All common cases are understood and properly shown to the user .
The principle also applies to more complex situations : the parsing could understand partially - written declarations , function calls , expressions , or any other structure of the grammar .
These partially - complete instances can live happily in the parse tree until they are complete , and can thus be properly treated .
I call this incremental approach “ lead - based parsing ” , because many of the parsing actions start from actual keywords and operators found in the middle of the code , instead of linearly from any given point .
Actually , since incremental parsing has to be done wherever a change happens , the parser always starts “ in the middle of the code ” in the general case .
Once designed , there are many other intricacies in the implementation , but the actual quantum leap was realizing that a switch of perspective was needed in order to reach the design goal .
And this switch took us to a completely new technique in parsing , one of the most studied areas of computing – all in the pursuit of creating a better development experience .
Conclusion
( Or , what does this all mean to you ? )
At the end of July 2007 , I was able to release Codekana 1.0 .
It included the incremental parsing system and many other features .
It was a small and useful tool , and it will hopefully become much more powerful in the future .
Obviously , Codekana is not “ the future of parsing ” .
It ’s just a little tool that can make the life of Visual Studio developers easier .
It has gone down a rarely - if - ever - visited path down the world of parsing , and it can offer a much better experience as a result .
Actually , it has had to go down that path in order to offer that improved experience .
I do believe that it ’s this kind of thinking which will get us to the next generation of computing as a whole .
Especially in computers , most things are not even thought about yet , let alone solved and done .
In computers , it ’s the early 1900s , baby .
Take - aways :
Never assume that everything is done in any given field .
When you have a vision , stick to it even if you do n’t know how to do it .
Know what the state - of - the - art is , so that you can use all available tools and you do n’t duplicate work .
Decide the goals around your vision , not around what you can easily do , or you wo n’t be able to innovate .
To solve the part not covered by existing techniques , you need to understand the essence of what you are trying to do .
But beware : it can take a huge effort to tell what the essence is , and what is just clutter surrounding it .
Innovation is impossible unless you see what is beneath the surface .
You can only copy other people ’s creations .
But as you learn to see the underlying principles , see what you want to achieve , and stick to your vision , innovating becomes unavoidable .
What do I think is the real , actual state - of - the - art in parsing ?
It ’s this : there are lifetimes of research pending to be done in parsing .
Turing - award - winning algorithms and techniques to discover .
Fortune - making products to be conceived and implemented .
This is just in parsing – a small corner of computer science which has been studied to exhaustion .
Do n’t make me talk about less - explored corners .
Now , please , go , and innovate .

Eye Floaters and Flashes / Spots in Your Vision
By Marilyn Haddrill ; contributions and review by Charles Slonim , MD
Schedule an exam Find Eye Doctor
Eye floaters are those tiny spots , specks , flecks and " cobwebs " that drift aimlessly around in your field of vision .
While annoying , ordinary eye floaters and spots are very common and usually are n't cause for alarm .
Floaters and spots typically appear when tiny pieces of the eye 's gel - like vitreous break loose within the inner back portion of the eye .
At birth and when we are young , the vitreous has a gel - like consistency .
But as we age , the vitreous begins to dissolve and liquefy to create a watery center .
Some undissolved gel particles occasionally will float around in the more liquid center of the vitreous .
These particles can take on many shapes and sizes to become what we refer to as " eye floaters . "
You 'll notice that these spots and eye floaters are particularly pronounced if you gaze at a clear or overcast sky or a computer screen with a white or light - colored background .
You wo n't actually be able to see tiny bits of debris floating loose within your eye .
Instead , shadows from these floaters are cast on the retina as light passes through the eye , and those tiny shadows are what you see .
You 'll also notice that these specks never seem to stay still when you try to focus on them .
Floaters and spots move when your eye and the vitreous gel inside the eye moves , creating the impression that they are " drifting . "
When are eye floaters and flashes a medical emergency ?
Noticing a few floaters from time to time is not a cause for concern .
However , if you see a shower of floaters and spots , especially if they are accompanied by flashes of light , you should seek medical attention immediately from an eye care professional .
The sudden appearance of these symptoms could mean that the vitreous is pulling away from your retina — a condition called posterior vitreous detachment .
Or it could mean that the retina itself is becoming dislodged from the back of the eye 's inner lining , which contains blood , nutrients and oxygen vital to healthy function .
As the vitreous gel tugs on the delicate retina , it might cause a small tear or hole in it .
When the retina is torn , vitreous can enter the opening and push the retina farther away from the inner lining of the back of the eye — leading to a retinal detachment .
A recent study published in Ophthalmology showed that , among people who experienced the sudden symptom of eye floaters and / or flashes of light , 39.7 percent had a posterior vitreous detachment and 8.9 percent had a torn retina .
Other research has shown that up to 50 percent of people with a retinal tear will subsequently develop a detachment of the retina , which could lead to significant vision loss .
In cases of retinal tear or detachment , treatment must occur as soon as possible so that an eye surgeon can reattach the retina and restore function before vision is lost permanently .
Posterior vitreous detachments ( PVDs ) are far more common than retinal detachments and often are not an emergency even when floaters appear suddenly .
Some vitreous detachments also can damage the retina by tugging on it , leading to a tear or detachment .
Light flashes known as photopsias can occur when your retina receives non-visual ( mechanical ) stimulation , which can happen when it is being tugged , torn or detached .
These light flashes may appear as lightning bolts , flickering lights or random sparks .
What causes eye floaters and spots ?
As mentioned above , posterior vitreous detachments ( PVDs ) are common causes of vitreous floaters .
Far less commonly , these symptoms can be associated with retinal tears or detachments that may be linked to PVDs .
What causes vitreous detachments ?
As the eye develops , the vitreous gel fills the inside of the back of the eye and presses against the retina and attaches to the surface of the retina .
Over time , the vitreous becomes more liquefied in the center .
This sometimes means that the central , more watery vitreous cannot support the weight of the heavier , more peripheral vitreous gel .
The peripheral vitreous gel then collapses into the central , liquefied vitreous , detaching from the retina ( like Jell - O separating from the inside of a gelatin mold or bowl ) .
Eye floaters resulting from a posterior vitreous detachment are then concentrated in the more liquid vitreous found in the interior center of the eye .
It 's estimated that more than half of all people will have a posterior vitreous detachment by age 80 .
Thankfully , most of these PVDs do not lead to a torn or detached retina .
Light flashes during this process mean that traction is being applied to your retina while the PVD takes place .
Once the vitreous finally detaches and pressure on the retina is eased , the light flashes should gradually subside .
What causes eye flashes ?
Ordinarily , light entering your eye stimulates the retina .
This produces an electrical impulse , which the optic nerve transmits to the brain .
The brain then interprets this impulse as light or some type of image .
If the retina is mechanically stimulated ( physically touched or tugged ) , a similar electrical impulse is sent to the brain .
This impulse is then interpreted as a " flicker " of light .
When the retina is tugged , torn or detached from the back of the eye , a flash or flicker of light commonly is noticed .
Depending on the extent of the traction , tear or detachment , these flashes of light might be short - lived or continue indefinitely until the retina is repaired .
Flashes ( photopsias ) also may occur after a blow to the head that is capable of shaking the vitreous gel inside the eye .
When this occurs , the phenomenon sometimes is called " seeing stars . "
Some people experience flashes of light that appear as jagged lines or " heat waves " in both eyes , often lasting 10 - 20 minutes .
These types of flashes are usually caused by a spasm of blood vessels in the brain .
If a headache follows the flashes , it is called a migraine headache .
However , jagged lines or " heat waves " can occur without a headache .
In this case , the light flashes are called an ophthalmic migraine , or a migraine without a headache .
SEE ALSO : What Is an Ocular Migraine ?
Photopsia also can be a symptom of digitalis toxicity , which can occur particularly in older people who take digitalis or related drugs for heart problems .
Other conditions associated with eye floaters and flashes
When a PVD is accompanied by bleeding inside the eye ( vitreous hemorrhage ) , it means the traction that occurred may have torn a small blood vessel in the retina .
A vitreous hemorrhage increases the possibility of a retinal tear or detachment .
Traction exerted on the retina during a PVD also can lead to development of conditions such as macular holes or puckers .
Vitreous detachments with accompanying eye floaters also may occur in circumstances such as :
Inflammation in the eye 's interior
Nearsightedness
Cataract surgery
YAG laser eye surgery
Diabetes ( diabetic vitreopathy )
CMV retinitis
Inflammation associated with many conditions such as eye infections can cause the vitreous to liquefy , leading to a PVD .
When you are nearsighted , your eye 's elongated shape also can increase the likelihood of a PVD and accompanying traction on the retina .
In fact , nearsighted people are more likely to have PVDs at a younger age .
PVDs are very common following cataract surgery and a follow - up procedure called a YAG laser capsulotomy .
Months or even years after cataract surgery , it 's not unusual for the thin membrane ( or " capsule " ) that 's left intact behind the intraocular lens ( IOL ) to become cloudy , affecting vision .
This delayed cataract surgery complication is called posterior capsular opacification ( PCO ) .
In the capsulotomy procedure used to treat PCO , a special type of laser focuses energy onto the cloudy capsule , vaporizing the central portion of it to create a clear path for light to reach the retina , which restores clear vision .
Manipulations of the eye during cataract surgery and YAG laser capsulotomy procedures cause traction that can lead to posterior vitreous detachments .
How to get rid of eye floaters
Most eye floaters and spots are harmless and merely annoying .
Many will fade over time and become less bothersome .
In most cases , no eye floaters treatment is required .
However , large persistent floaters can be very bothersome to some people , causing them to seek a way to get rid of eye floaters and spots drifting in their field of view .
In the past , the only treatment for eye floaters was an invasive surgical procedure called a vitrectomy .
In this procedure , some or all of the vitreous is removed from the eye ( along with the eye floaters within it ) and is replaced with a sterile clear fluid .
But the risks of a vitrectomy usually outweigh the benefits for eye floater treatment .
These risks include surgically induced retinal detachment and serious eye infections .
On rare occasions , vitrectomy surgery can cause new or even more floaters .
For these reasons , most eye surgeons do not recommend vitrectomy to treat eye floaters and spots .
Laser treatment for eye floaters
Recently , a laser procedure called laser vitreolysis has been introduced that is a much safer alternative to vitrectomy for eye floater treatment .
In this in - office procedure , a laser beam is projected into the eye through the pupil and is focused on large floaters , which breaks them apart and / or frequently vaporizes them so they disappear or become much less bothersome .
To determine if you can benefit from laser vitreolysis to get rid of eye floaters , your eye doctor will consider several factors , including your age , how quickly your symptoms started , what your floaters look like and where they are located .
If you do n't have an eye doctor , please click here to find one near you .
The floaters in patients younger than age 45 tend to be located too close to the retina and can't be safely treated with laser vitreolysis .
Patients with sizable eye floaters located farther away from the retina are better suited to the procedure .
The ophthalmologist who performs laser vitreolysis also will evaluate the shape and borders of your eye floaters .
Those with " soft " borders often can be treated successfully .
Likewise , sizable floaters that appear suddenly as a result of a posterior vitreous detachment often can be successfully treated with the laser procedure .
What happens during laser treatment
Laser vitreolysis usually is pain - free and can be performed in your ophthalmologist 's office .
Just prior to the treatment , anesthetic eye drops are applied and a special type of contact lens is placed on your eye .
Then , the doctor will look through a biomicroscope ( slit lamp ) to precisely deliver the laser energy to the floaters being treated .
During the procedure , you might notice dark spots .
These are pieces of broken up floaters .
The treatment can take up to a half hour , but it 's usually significantly shorter .
At the end of the procedure , the contact lens is removed , your eye is rinsed with saline and the doctor will apply an anti-inflammatory eye drop .
Additional eye drops may be prescribed for you to use at home .
Sometimes , you may see small dark spots shortly after treatment .
These are small gas bubbles that tend to resolve quickly .
There also is a chance that you 'll have some mild discomfort , redness or blurry vision immediately after the procedure .
These effects are common and typically wo n't prevent you from returning to your normal activities immediately following laser vitreolysis .
Your doctor will usually schedule follow - up for the following day .
At that time , you may need a second treatment .
If you are bothered by large , persistent eye floaters , ask your eye doctor if laser vitreolysis might be a good treatment option for your situation .
Remember , a sudden appearance of a significant number of eye floaters , especially if they are accompanied by flashes of light or other vision disturbances , could indicate a detached retina or other serious problem in the eye .
If you suddenly see new floaters , visit your eye doctor without delay .

Bill Niman built a $ 65 million empire on a simple idea that revolutionized the food world - that meat could be more than just what 's for dinner .
It could be raised naturally , humanely and sustainably , better for people and the planet .
Niman knew success would take time , but believed his methods would prove profitable .
But in nearly 30 years of existence , despite becoming the darling of high - end chefs and turning the brand into a household name , Niman Ranch never did turn a profit .
In fact , it was broke .
To save it from Bankruptcy Court , the East Bay company merged last month with its chief investor , Chicago 's Natural Food Holdings LLC , and Niman was officially out .
The 64 - year - old Bolinas man said he can live with losing the business he built from scratch .
But he can't stand quietly by , he says , while the new owners fundamentally change the brand that influenced an entire food movement .
He refuses to eat their products .
Officials from the company argue that the integrity of Niman Ranch 's meat program has never been better .
" We believe that our protocols are stronger , the auditing of the protocols more rigorous , and the current business model is more financially viable , " said Niman Ranch CEO Jeff Swain .
Still , it prompts the question : Can idealism ever pay ?
Many say Niman is the epitome of an idealist , whose mission was to change the way people eat and encourage them to think ethically about their food .
" He showed you can raise farm animals with commercial success , without resorting to exceedingly cruel practices , " said Wayne Pacelle , president and CEO of the Humane Society of the United States .
" There are some people in the humane movement who do n't think there is any such thing as happy meat .
But in the larger vision , Bill Niman led the pathway . "
Commercially , Niman 's methods were unorthodox , the ideals of a hippie who had moved out West during the Vietnam War to avoid the draft by teaching school in the heart of farm country .
Unlike mainstream producers , Niman forbid growth hormones , used antibiotics only when an animal became sick , and demanded that the livestock be raised on the open range and readied for slaughter in an uncrowded , Niman - owned feedlot .
Most commercial beef producers send weaned calves to a feedlot to grow and be finished on grain , but Niman 's cattle grazed on grass - virtually unheard of in the 1970s .
Although standard beef cattle are most often slaughtered between 12 and 14 months , Niman did n't slaughter them until 20 to 24 months , moving them at 14 months to his own feedlot where they were fattened on a vegetarian diet of grain for four or five more months .
" It 's almost double the cost to do it the way we were doing it , " said Niman , who believes his results - perfectly marbled beef - were unrivaled .
Ken Bentz , an Oregon cattleman who has been ranching since World War II and subscribes to the same natural methods , wonders if it was n't a bit over the top .
" It was more extreme than what I would have done , " he said .
" He went far beyond what was expected because he was a fanatic for flavor .
But it showed .
He produced the best quality beef in the world . "
Niman did n't grow up on a farm .
Still , he knew a thing or two about food .
His father owned a grocery store in Minneapolis .
Niman spent his youth shopping with his dad at farmers ' markets , and worked weekends stocking shelves and operating the cash register .
By 21 , he had earned a degree in anthropology and was enrolled in law school .
But the Vietnam War was raging and Niman knew it was just a matter of time before he would be called up for duty .
His college roommate had already been killed in the war he fiercely opposed .
He learned that he could get out of the draft if he volunteered to teach middle school as part of President Lyndon Johnson 's 1965 program to wipe out poverty in the United States .
By 1968 , Niman was teaching science to students in a poor cotton - growing community of the San Joaquin Valley .
Eventually , he went back to school to get his teaching credential and got a school job in West Marin .
It was there that he met his first wife , Amy Gettinger , who would later die in a horse - riding accident .
Spread in Bolinas
The couple decided they'd like a few acres to raise a couple of goats , chickens , hogs and horses .
So they bought 11 acres in Bolinas for $ 1,800 .
Financially it was a stretch for the two teachers , but they made up the difference by moonlighting at a local cafe .
A cattle ranching neighbor , who had spent generations perfecting his livestock 's bloodlines , gave them six orphaned calves .
Those became the foundation of the herd that would later become Niman Ranch .
Niman subsequently gave up teaching to work on his small farm , making his living by doing construction .
He had also become politically involved in the small seaside town that was attracting intellectuals , writers , artists and others caught up in a burgeoning back - to - the - land food scene .
He became friends with Orville Schell , a Bolinas activist and writer who would eventually become dean of UC Berkeley 's Graduate School of Journalism .
Schell temporarily moved into Niman 's chicken coop , and the pair bought hogs to raise and sell to friends and neighbors .
Word spread quickly of their delicious pork , raised on pasture land and fed a steady diet of Nancy 's organic yogurt that was past its sell - by date and barley .
In 1977 , Niman and Schell bought 200 acres on the Bolinas coastline and began running cattle .
In the beginning they were focused on breeding , shipping off the weaned calves to other ranches to be readied for slaughter .
But in the 1980s the price of beef bottomed out under a government program to reduce an oversupply of dairy products on the market , which included buying up milk cows for slaughter .
So the two decided to mature their cattle on grass for the gourmet market .
At the time , they called it Niman - Schell Ranch .
But by the mid-1990s they were squabbling .
Niman said it was over distribution of work and money .
" The problem was that he had it and I did n't , " Niman recalled , now chuckling .
Schell declined to comment .
In 1997 the two parted ways , and Niman took over the business .
But even before they split , their all - natural meat was getting lots of buzz .
Three of the Bay Area 's top restaurateurs - Alice Waters of Chez Panisse in Berkeley , Judy Rodgers of Zuni Cafe in San Francisco and Margaret Fox of Cafe Beaujolais in Mendocino - began serving Niman meat .
The women took Niman under their wing , coaching him on what chefs looked for in a truly good cut of beef .
" We were very interested in organic and sustainable products and were fascinated by what Bill was doing , " said Fox , now culinary director of Harvest Market in Fort Bragg .
" We could taste the difference in the meat .
It was incredibly delicious . "
Switching to Niman was risky .
" It was significantly more expensive than the other meats we were buying , " Fox said .
But she took a chance .
Then she did something rarely heard of back then :
Fox put Niman Ranch 's name next to the meat dishes on the menu .
And diners were eating it up .
Soon , other restaurants were doing it - first with Niman Ranch , then with the names of farms that provided their produce .
Despite the retail price for Niman Ranch products , sometimes twice that of supermarket meat , demand spread from top - drawer restaurants and specialty stores to national supermarkets and eventually even the fast - food chain Chipotle Mexican Grill .
Spent more than it made
Maybe it was too much too soon , because the company was spending more than it was taking in .
Demand required that Niman form a network of likeminded ranchers and farmers , who raised their beef , pork and sheep naturally on pasture .
He chose them based on their protocols , and spent much of his time visiting farms and ranches to ensure that everything was up to snuff .
But by 2006 , when Chicago 's Natural Food Holdings came in as chief investor , taking four of the seven seats on the board of directors , Niman Ranch was losing somewhere close to $ 3 million , said CEO Swain .
" I consciously deferred profitability to expand the brand , " Niman said , adding that he was on a mission to change people 's eating habits and the wider and faster he could spread his message the better .
He also wanted to give young people , who were gung - ho about the sustainable food business , a place to grow with the company .
But looking back on it , he said , it was a " strategic error to defer profitability for as long as we did . "
Many thought it was Niman 's beloved cattle business that was draining the company .
The pork division was thriving .
" The beef industry is very tough , " said Rob Hurlbut , Niman Ranch 's former CEO , who left the company three years ago .
" It operates on vast numbers of livestock and a low profit margin - only 1 percent to 2 percent .
And that 's for the factory meat industry .
It 's even more challenging for people like us who were doing it all . "
Niman insisted that all the cattle come from either his herd or his 35 - ranch network .
Unlike their hogs , raised by Midwestern corn and soybean farmers until the day of slaughter , the cattle were taken from ranches around the Northwest to Niman 's feedlot for finishing .
The system was time consuming and costly .
But , according to Niman , he could n't cut corners if he wanted to ensure that his beef was all natural .
Hurlbut locked horns with Niman , trying to convince him that streamlining the cattle operation in the same way they did the swine line would make the business profitable .
But Niman was n't budging .
" He suffered from classic founder syndrome , " said Guy Muzio , an early investor , who wound up walking away after the merger with only 12 1/2 cents for every dollar he put into the company .
" He was resistant to change . "
For an old - timer like Bentz , who owns one of the cattle ranches that provided Niman Ranch with some of its beef , the error was in taking money from strangers .
There were too many investors .
" I learned a long time ago that where the money comes from , so do the orders , " he said .
Looking back on it now , Niman is circumspect .
" I needed the money , " he said .
But that did n't keep him from fighting the board when they made changes with which he disagreed .
After Natural
Food came on the scene , they sold the Niman Ranch feedlot and began finishing the cattle in commercial lots .
Niman complained that there was no way to guarantee that Niman Ranch 's cattle were n't eating the same food fed to other cattle , raised on a less stringent protocol .
" The company - owned feedlot was sold in 2008 because it was not financially viable , " Swain wrote in an e-mail to The Chronicle .
" The feedlots we work with today are required to follow the same high animal husbandry practices for our cattle as those followed in the previously company - owned feedlot . "
Use of antimicrobials
Niman also battled with the new management over the use of antimicrobials , drugs that kill bacteria .
While the substances are not classified by the USDA as an antibiotic , Niman says they work in the same way and are not natural .
Under his leadership , they were never used .
" The bottom line on this point is that we once had the strictest feed standards in the industry as well as the highest humane animal treatment protocols , " Niman angrily wrote the board in a 2007 memo .
" Our standards were always based on several major concerns including : the health and well - being of the animal , human health and the environment . "
But Swain disagrees .
" It is our opinion and the opinion of leading experts , that it is better animal husbandry to use them ( antimicrobials ) , than not to use them . "
In another 2007 memo to Swain , Niman charged the company with treating the cattle inhumanely , including transporting them nearly 1,300 miles , forcing them to stand in cramped quarters for more than 24 hours , to the slaughterhouse .
He said they had lost at least six cattle on those trips .
" The time an animal spends in transit is well under the guidelines adopted by USDA and our goal is to minimize shipping distances , " Swain countered in an e-mail , adding that it would be rare that they would transport their animals 1,300 miles .
But " cattle shipped over 500 miles are shipped a day earlier and upon arrival are put on feed and water for 24 hours to rehydrate and rest . "
Swain said the six cattle that died were not Niman Ranch 's , but those of ranchers asking to borrow space in their trucks .
Swain not only swears by the integrity of the program , but says that since Natural Food took over the company , it 's making $ 7,000 a week , rather than losing $ 10,000 .
All it took was some streamlining .
But at no time , he said , have they ever deviated from the company 's original mission .
" I think idealism can pay , " he said .
" But it has to be couched with practicality . "
Niman 's faith in the company that will still bear his name is gone , but his faith in raising food sustainably , and for profit , has never been stronger .
Besides raising grass - fed beef and goats , he and his wife , Nicolette , whom he married in 2003 , think heritage turkeys just might be the ticket .
Last year they carted 225 poults ( baby turkeys ) in the back seat of their car from the Midwest to start their breeding flock .
By Thanksgiving they 'll be in business .
" Frankly , we think it might be the most profitable enterprise so far , " Niman said .
As for Niman Ranch : " I 'm proud of it .
It was a pioneer effort that changed the way people think about their food . "
As the host towns , Whistler and Vancouver prepare to welcome the world in 2010 , local media democracy is feeling the effects of increased censorship .
During a routine interview , local journalists were informed by Whistler Mayor , Ken Melamed that he would no longer be speaking to local press , unless they went through the RMOW 's Communications Department first .
Effective immediately , all media inquiries would be need to go through the municipality 's communications department .
The new protocol upset some local reporters , since they had fostered a long - term relationship with the mayor , often calling him after - hours to ask him questions .
The attack on media democracy actually began in January , when the town 's administrator moved council meetings from Monday to Tuesday evening ( giving reporters far less time to ask questions for the weekly Thursday publication ) .
There 's a rumour swirling around town that council meetings will be cancelled all together six months before the Olympics ( i.e. Oct 2009 - March 2010 ) .
Why should elected officials remain accountable to the general public and taxpayers , when there are hotdogs and stuffed animals to sell , and security cameras to install ?
At the March 2 council meeting , Mayor Melamed reminded local media about the Resort Municipality of Whistler 's 2005 Communications Plan .
Although the plan had n't been enforced until last week , it states that all councillors must consult with the management before responding to any media requests .
This new protocol also applies to all municipal staff .
No advisory , either verbal or written , had been issued to the media about the new policy .
Melamed added that the plan is in effect now because of the large volume of media calls he 's been receiving in the one - year countdown to the Olympics .
He told the public , " It 's in the community 's interest to have clear , consistent , factual communication that goes out .
Really , all we 're trying to do is manage our reputation . "
Could it be that Whistler 's elected officials " let too many cats out of VANOC 's bag ? "
Have there been too many information leaks , especially when it came to questions about accountability about the controversial 2010 Celebrations Plaza , destroyed wetlands and rising Olympic - related costs ?
Whatever the reason , it 's clear that the powers up believe it 's time to minimize information leaks .
Most councillors did n't even know this policy existed -- not even the two incumbents .
Free - thinking councillors like Eckhard Zeidler and Grant Lamont said they will continue to speak to the media and the public -- directly , and face the wrath of the Communications Department .
As a resident of Whistler , I am very concerned about the impediments being placed between our elected officials and the local media .
It makes it increasingly difficult for average citizens to get the information they need to decide whether those in government , both hired and elected , are acting in their best interest .
I guess we can look forward to even more diluted news coming out of the RMOW and VANOC in the next 12 months .
I gather Mayor Melamed is serious about the new policy , because he changed his cell phone number last week .
Got any questions ?
Please call the RMOW 's Communications Department at 604-935-8104 .

A 10 - year - old Indian girl was beheaded by her grandfather , who believed that sowing seeds mixed with her blood would yield a bumper crop .
The killing , spurred by age - old superstitions , took place on Sunday in the tribal region of Sambalpur , 450 kilometres west of Bhubaneshwar , the capital of Orissa state , the IANS news agency reported .
The barbaric crime was detected after the villagers caught the man , Rajesh Hembram , and handed him over to the police .
Hembram , who owned 1.2 hectares of farmland , planned to sow seeds mixed with the blood of his granddaughter on Monday on Akshaya Tritya , a day considered auspicious by Hindus , police said .
" He cut off his granddaughter Bernaka Kandulana 's head with an axe in a room when nobody was at home and drained her blood into a pot , " P.C. Nayak , a police inspector said .
Unity Through Community
Non-profit organizations give of their time and energy so that they can help make the world a better place .
No matter where or who they are they all share a desire to help .
May their documented story continue to unite and inspire us .
Everyone wants the world to be a better place , and I think what a lot of people look for in answers on how to do something so big are ways that they can help in their community .
The culture of non-profit organizations is an attractive source for many when desiring to give of their time , energy , and money for a bigger cause .
We hear of great organizations doing great things every once in a while when we 're not looking .
Whether it's a story featured in an article or a television show we are n't as exposed to the wonderful things these non-profits are doing .
We , especially , are n't hearing about it as a worldwide means .
If we can help in our own community , than should n't we try to unify non-profits around the world to make a stronger impact that 'll get more people informed and excited ?
I think by documenting stories of wonderful organizations around the world through photography and writing , there would be an increase in individuals wanting to help .
I believe photojournalism is powerful and can influence for the better .
As we feature different non-profits making awesome changes in their community , not only does it give them exposure on a larger scale , but it also gives a face and a name to causes that are n't as familiar to many of us .
Those faces and names belong to people who have stories that can inspire and move millions worldwide .
With the advantage of the Internet and media my dream assignment is to cover as many non-profits around the world as I can , so that I can inform readers through my blog , my photos / videos / writing and let it move others to give a helping hand .
I want to bring unity through community , and I believe this can happen with the help of winning this contest .
I 've always had a heart to share stories and am currently pursuing a career as a professional photographer with a journalism degree so that I can do assignments like this for as long as I can .
I think we all could use hearing and seeing another good story that stirs our hearts and asks us to help make the world a better place .
I 've already begun my research by finding non-profits around the world on websites like idealist.org .
It would be an honor to photograph and work alongside each organization that I meet , and I would give all that I can to do my best on this assignment .
I hope that you can join along with me and help me make this dream become a reality .
Thank you !

Russia is developing a new generation of space vehicles
Enlarge Image
Russian space officials are to select the winning proposal for a new rocket intended to carry cosmonauts on missions to the Moon .
This will mark the first time since 1964 that the Russian space programme has made the Moon its main objective .
It will be only the second time since the collapse of the Soviet Union that Moscow has endorsed the development of a new space vehicle .
The rocket is expected to fly its first test mission in about 2015 .
According to the objectives given by the Russian space agency ( Roscosmos ) to industry , a future rocket should be able to hoist a payload three times heavier than Russia 's veteran Soyuz spacecraft , including twice the number of crew , and use environmentally friendly propellants .
The development of the new rocket should be accompanied by work on Russia 's next - generation manned spacecraft , which will use it to get into orbit .
Russian space officials say the yet - to - be - named rocket should carry its first manned spacecraft in 2018 .
The project was timed to roughly coincide with the US space agency 's ( Nasa ) plans to return astronauts to the Moon by 2020 under its Constellation programme .
Late start
However , in what seems like a case of history repeating itself , Russia is starting late in its bid to beat the US - and potentially China - to the Moon .
In 1961 , President John F Kennedy met the Soviet challenge in space by launching the original US lunar effort .
Yet the Soviet government waited until 1964 before committing itself to the costly expenditure of a manned landing .
The Kremlin ultimately aborted the monumental effort after the Apollo 11 lunar module touched down on the Moon first .
In a 21st Century version of this Moon race , the US , Europe , China , India and Japan had all declared their intention to explore Earth 's natural satellite , while Russia struggled to emerge from its post -Soviet economic crisis .
As Nasa starts unveiling the first prototypes of US rockets and spacecraft for lunar expeditions , Roscosmos is only starting its lunar programme .
To make matters worse , along with the new fleet of rockets and spacecraft which need to be built , the Russian government committed in 2007 to moving its main space launch site from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan to Vostochny in Russia 's Far East .
The new rocket is intended to carry a manned capsule to the Moon
In 2008 , Roscosmos finally started quietly soliciting proposals from the industry to develop a brand - new rocket which could support lunar expeditions .
All major Russian space firms reportedly vied for the government contract to build the vehicle .
While Roscosmos had never publicised details of the bidding process , a number of Russian space officials hinted that they were close to choosing a winner at the beginning of 2009 .
On 14 March , Alexander Chulkov , head of the rocket and launch facilities directorate at Roscosmos , told BBC News that the agency would pick a winner by March 25 .
" We have a bidding procedure , under which we made a request for proposals and now will be reviewing those proposals to determine a prime developer , based on the most interesting project from the cost - effectiveness point of view , " Mr Chulkov said .
He explained that the agency 's main requirement for the future manned rocket was to be able to carry no less than 20 tonnes to low - Earth orbit , with the maximum capacity of about 23 tonnes .
For comparison , the Soyuz capsule , which Soviet and Russian cosmonauts have been riding to orbit since 1967 , weighs around seven tonnes .
Nasa 's Ares - I rocket for the next - generation Orion spacecraft will be able to lift a total of 25 tonnes .
Everybody wins ?
Contenders must also employ non -toxic propellants such as kerosene or liquid hydrogen on all stages of the vehicle .
According to Mr Chulkov , industry will generally be free to design the general architecture of the future rocket .
" Roscosmos has its own opinion about the configuration ( of the rocket ) , which we would like to see , however , we understand there is some distance between what we want and what might be available , " Chulkov said .
The new Russian rocket could take one of several configurations
Enlarge Image
The decision on the prime developer would clear the way to the preliminary design phase of the rocket , which was expected to last for about one year .
" Thus , in 2009 we will start the development of this rocket , " Mr Chulkov said .
Although the Russian space agency is expected to name a single prime developer , it has been rumoured in unofficial fora that the contract would distribute various responsibilities for the project among several major rocket firms .
These include TsSKB Progress in Samara , the developer of the Soyuz rocket , and KB Mashinostroenia in Miass , a chief developer of submarine - launched ballistic missiles .
Thus , a bulk of the workforce building Russian rockets today will remain employed .
How heavy is heavy ?
A new rocket to loft the manned spacecraft is only one component in the array of hardware that will be required to land humans on the Moon in the 21st century .
With the multi-launch scenario for a lunar expedition adopted by both Nasa and Roscosmos , a separate heavy - lift vehicle would be needed to launch the lunar landing module and the rocket stage to propel it from Earth orbit towards the Moon .
However , it seems that Nasa and Russia have a drastically different understanding of what " heavy - lift " means .
While the US space agency embarked on the development of its titanic Ares - V rocket with a payload capacity target of 145 tonnes , Russian space officials have indicated a much lower appetite for payload tonnage .
" In the field of heavy - lifting rockets we have the yet - to - be - flown Angara ( rocket ) , while the requirements for the next - generation rocket are within the same category , " Mr Chulkov said .
The Angara rocket , which has been under development since the mid-1990s , is expected to make its maiden flight in 2011 .
It would be capable of carrying as many as 35 tonnes into low - Earth orbit .
But some of its derivatives could lift between 40 and 50 tonnes .
According to documents from the Khrunichev enterprise , developer of the Angara rocket , up to four launches of the Angara - 7 vehicle would be required to accomplish a single lunar expedition .
By comparison , Nasa can rely on one Ares - I rocket and one Ares - V for each Moon landing .

HBO has given the production order .
They will be filming the pilot episode of A GAME OF THRONES .
It 's just the pilot so far .
They 'll need to see that before they decide whether to proceed with a full season 's episodes .
So let 's all hope the pilot will kick serious ass .
It should .
David Benioff and Dan Weiss did a terrific job with the script .
And yes , all of you can relax , it 's very faithful .
Dan and David will be the executive producers for the pilot and ( we hope ) the eventual series .
More details when I have 'em .
The news is very fresh .
HBO just issued their own press release , which should be up on their website soon , if it 's not there already .
Winter is coming to HBO .
Hot damn .
Index of Topics
A large but still incomplete listing of topics on this site , including coverage of various esoteric teachings and other things of interest .
Most of this material is by yours truly , but there are also a few essays and pages by other writers more competent than I in various fields .
This is probably the best and easisest starting point ( entries listed in alphabetical order ) .
A few topics and starting points are listed below .
Metaphysics
My latest attempt at a single unified explanation of everything , a sort of grand overview of the different aspects of being and the direction and purpose of existence .
Planes of Existence Materialism
says that only physical matter is real .
Esotericism asserts in contrast that reality consists of a succession of dimensions of existence , of varying “ density ” .
For the sake of convenience I use the Neoplatonic and Theosophical terminology to refer to these gradations as “ planes ” of existence , although they can just as easily be called dimensions of Consciousness .
This is a new section of the site that nevertheless incorporates some of the older material I originally posted in 1998 , plus some more recent insights .
Chakras
Chakras are centers or focal - points of consciousness within the subtle body , each corresponding to a particular aspect and polarity of being .
Rather than a single line , they represent a complex arrangement , variously described in different esoteric teachings .
EcoGnosis and Astrognosis
Higher knowledge about both our human social surroundings and the natural environment which is the home we share with all other life on this planet .
Also regarding our place in the cosmos , and the the way cosmic forces impact on life and consciousness on Earth .
Most essays by Steven Guth
Future Multiplex
A postmaterialistic society
is emerging right now .
But will it be enough to swing the world around and avoid catastrophe ?
And is it the beginning of a more integral transformation ?
Interpretations regarding the future include gradualist , pessimistic , and consumationist scenarios , which may be social , technological , or metaphysical , esoteric , and spiritual .
Sentientism
Central to my worldview is the empathic insight that all sentient beings , regardless of species , should be treated with kindness and respect .
This idea goes back to Jainism ( the wheel on the palm symbolises the Jain Vow of Ahimsa ) ; to be universally valid , an integral philosophy or participatory ethic has to go beyond the anthropocentrism of mainstream secularism and religionism .
Essays
A selected list of several longer essays and articles that do n’t fit under particular topics .
Includes essays by myself and also several essays by Robert Searle

It is vital for patients to keep their blood sugar levels under control Failure to control type 2 diabetes may have a long - term impact on the brain , research has suggested .
Severe hypoglycaemic episodes - hypos - occur when blood sugar levels drop dangerously low .
A University of Edinburgh team found they may lead to poorer memory and diminished brain power .
The study , based on 1,066 people with type 2 diabetes aged between 60 and 75 , was presented at a conference of the charity Diabetes UK .
HYPOGLYCAEMIA Hypoglycaemia is caused by a lack of sugar ( glucose ) reaching the brain , which uses it as fuel Symptoms can include sweating , fatigue , hunger , feeling dizzy , feeling weak , a higher heart rate than usual and blurred vision
More severe episodes can led to temporary loss of consciousness , convulsions and coma
The volunteers completed seven tests assessing mental abilities such as memory , logic and concentration .
The 113 people who had previously experienced severe hypos scored lower than the rest of the group .
They performed poorly in tests of their general mental ability , and vocabulary .
There are at least 670,000 people in England aged between 60 and 75 years old who have Type 2 diabetes and around a third of them could be at risk of a hypo .
Possible reasons Lead researcher Dr Jackie Price said : " Either hypos lead to cognitive decline , or cognitive decline makes it more difficult for people to manage their diabetes , which in turn causes more hypos .
" A third explanation could be that a third unidentified factor is causing both the hypos and the cognitive decline .
" We are carrying out more research to establish which explanation is the most likely . "
Dr Iain Frame , director of research at Diabetes UK , said : " This study reinforces previous evidence which suggests that poorly controlled diabetes affects the functioning of the brain .
" We already know that type 2 diabetes increases the risk of developing Alzheimer 's disease , which is a type of dementia , and this research adds another piece to a very complex jigsaw puzzle .
" However , more research is needed before we can come to any firm conclusions . "
There are 2.5 million people diagnosed with diabetes in the UK and up to 500,000 who have type 2 diabetes but do not know it .
It is predicted that by 2025 there will be up to four million people with diabetes in the UK .

RNC chairman : voters have ' no reason ' to trust GOP Jeremy Gantz
Published : Friday February 13 , 2009
Print This Email This
The chairman of the Republican National Committee has confirmed what Democrats and millions of others frustrated with his party have probably been thinking for a while : the GOP can't be trusted .
In a surprisingly frank exchange on Glenn Beck 's Fox News program Friday , Michael Steele responded to Beck 's anger that the Republican Party had " betrayed " its supporters by allowing " socialism " to occur in America this way :
" Im not going to soft pedal this with you , " Steele said .
" The reality of it is , you are absolutely right .
You have absolutely no reason , none , to trust our word or our actions at this point . "
Beck was apparently referring to legislation passed during the last six months , amounting to more than a trillion dollars in bailouts and spending  including the $ 789 billion stimulus package which passed the House Friday and is expected to pass the Senate , and the $ 700 billion " bailout " passed into law last October .
The fact that a trio of Republican senators  Senators Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe of Maine and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania  have broke with their colleagues to vote for the new stimulus bill likely also prompted Beck 's umbrage .
" We expect socialism from some of the Democrats .
We do n't expect it from you , " Beck told Steele , as the question " What is GOP going to do to stop march toward socialism ? " ran at the bottom of the screen .
" We actually took a lot of crap for a long time ...
And then you guys betrayed us .
Why should we even think twice of pulling a level again ? "
After Steele said regaining supporters ' trust is " going to be an uphill climb , " Beck declared the chairman 's answer " refreshing . "
A conservative political action committee has pledged to support primary challenges to any GOP senator who supports the stimulus bill , CNN reported .
" Republican senators are on notice , " Scott Wheeler , the executive director of The National Republican Trust PAC , told the network earlier this week .
" If they support the stimulus package , we will make sure every voter in their state knows how they tried to further bankrupt voters in an already bad economy . "

The power - point format ( minutes 10 – 50 ) with 18 slides includes the bogus claim of a “ house from the time of Jesus , ” the forgery of the Caesarea Inscription mentioning Nazareth ( universally considered authentic and often dated to the first century CE ) , and material from both my Nazareth books .

The sequel to The Myth of Nazareth ( 2008 ) documents burgeoning scandals on the ground
and a desperate race to create evidence for the nonexistent hometown of Jesus .
In softcover and Kindle editions from American Atheist Press .
With a Foreword by Frank R. Zindler .
And my , there have been developments on the ground since the appearance of my first book …
The false claim of Hellenistic coins from Mary ’s Well , the bogus “ house from the time of Jesus ” ( it was really a wine producing installation beginning in Late Roman times ) , a rewrite of ambitious Jesus - era claims at the Nazareth Village Farm , the strangely uninformed work of Dr. Ken Dark in Nazareth , the revelation that the Caesarea Inscription ( the only non-Christian epigraphic evidence for the settlement before the time of Constantine ! ) is a rank forgery — all these are treated in NazarethGate , as well as my views ( the final chapter ) on the founding prophet behind the religion we call Christianity — a man who lived one century before “ Jesus . ”
Nazareth is witnessing a Christian construction boom .
Two megasites for believers have appeared in the last decade , one Protestant , the other Catholic , while the Israeli state reveals itself to be a vigorous partner in promoting Christian tourism to the small and troubled land .
But as hundreds of millions of dollars are spent on new hotels and other infrastructure to bring in streams of pilgrims , NazarethGate shows that no historical and archeological basis exists for any of it .
Word is now getting around — rumors that under the Church of the Annunciation are Roman - era tombs , that the Gospel of Luke ’s portrait of Nazareth does not even vaguely match reality , and that Jesus may not even have existed .

and from the author .
The Myth of Nazareth meticulously reviews the archaeology of the Nazareth basin from the Stone Age to the present , and shows that the settlement of Nazareth came into existence in the early second century C.E. , well after the time of Christ .
In this study René Salm reviews all the structural and movable evidence from the first excavations in the late 19th century to the most recent reports .
This review also encompasses the extensive secondary literature , found in books and reference articles in dictionaries and encyclopedias .
Salm shows that traditional conclusions found in all these works regarding the settlement of Nazareth are radically inconsistent with the itemized evidence in the ground .
These six oil lamps were discovered in a Nazareth tomb , and have been used in the scholarly literature as proof of a village at Nazareth in Hellenistic times , as early as the third century BCE .
In fact , the six lamps date from the Middle Roman to the Late Roman periods , long after the time of Christ .
Gross misdatings of the primary evidence , sometimes involving discrepancies of up to 500 years , are frequently encountered in the Nazareth literature .
The compromised archaeology of Nazareth The Myth of Nazareth shows that the village came into existence not earlier than 70 CE ( the climax of the First Jewish War ) , and most likely in early II CE — the same era in which the canonical gospels were being edited .
Furthermore , this study shows that there was a long hiatus in settlement in the Nazareth basin between the Late Iron Age ( c. 700 BCE ) and Middle Roman times ( c. 100 CE ) .
Finally , it is probable that the extensive remains in the Nazareth basin from the Bronze and Iron Ages are in fact to be identified with biblical Japhia .
These conclusions are based on a unanimity of the material evidence from multiple excavations in the Nazareth basin .
Whether we are speaking of “ Herodian ” oil lamps ( which constitute the earliest Roman evidence ) , glass , metal , or stone objects , inscriptions , coins , “ kokh ” tombs with or without rolling stones , wall foundations , or agricultural installations — all of these point to a Jewish settlement beginning in early II CE and thriving in Late Roman and Byzantine times .
Extra-archaeological data confirm this conclusion .
In an explosive revelation , The Myth of Nazareth shows that a number of Roman tombs ( not mentioned in any guidebook ) exist directly under the Church of the Annunciation , the most venerated site in Nazareth .
This locus was part of a cemetery during later Roman times .
It could not have been the domicile of the Virgin Mary — a proposition abhorrent in a Jewish context for , according to Torah , tombs were never located within the precincts of a Jewish village , nor near or under habitations .
Both the traditional chronology and location are in error , for the cemetery at Nazareth came into existence several generations after the alleged time of the Virgin .
The background Most scholars summarily dismiss the “ invention ” of Nazareth on the grounds that the town is frequently mentioned in the Christian gospels .
Unwittingly , archaeology is thus held hostage to literary considerations .
The textual case for Nazareth in the gospels is much weaker , however , than is generally supposed .
The settlement is named only once in the Gospel of Mark , at 1:9 ( other instances in the Greek text read “ Jesus the Nazarene ” ) .
The passage as it stands demonstrably conflicts with the remainder of the gospel , which locates Jesus ’ home in Capernaum .
Thus , it can be shown that the Gospel of Mark contains the later interpolation of a single word , “ Nazaret ” at 1:9 .
Furthermore , the literary genesis of Nazareth occurs in one of the most problematic passages of Christian scripture , Mt 2:23 :
And he went and dwelt in a city called Nazaret , that what was spoken by the prophets might be fulfilled , “ He shall be called a Nazoraean . ”
No such prophetic utterance has been identified in the Jewish scriptures .
For its part , the Gospel of Luke is equally problematic .
The enigmatic scene in the Nazareth synagogue ( Lk 4:16 - 30 ) has been shown to be an elaborate reworking of prior materials .
Furthermore , the third evangelist demonstrates a strident anti-Capernaum stance , one which impels him to divorce Jesus as much as possible from Capernaum roots .
A flawed record The archaeological record of Nazareth has been written principally by Franciscan excavators on site .
Subsequent reviews of critical finds in journals and monographs , by Israeli archaeologists and others , often contradict the conclusions of the Church and form an important part of The Myth of Nazareth .
The Myth of Nazareth reveals an embarrassing history of unscientific fieldwork , tendentious publication , and suppressed evidence reaching back many generations .
It is a searing indictment of one school of biblical archaeology .
Where did Jesus come from ?
The Myth of Nazareth : The Invented Town of Jesus invalidates a central element of Christian tradition .
The weighty consequences of its argument inevitably entail a reexamination of the meaning of “ Nazarene / Nazoraean , ” a reconsideration of the provenance of Jesus , a questioning of the motives of the evangelists in changing that provenance , and a clarification of the textual means by which they did so .
This book presages a paradigm shift in Christian studies , one with telling consequences for the interpretation of early Christianity , the assessment of the gospel witness , and the traditional portrait of Jesus .
This timely and thoroughly - researched exposé
is sure to significantly impact the traditional view of Christian beginnings .

The following are excerpts from various American medical journals ... Prepare yourself , they are pretty amazing and gross ( but all are true ) .
You have been warned !!!!
INNER SKELETON
A 63 year old widow was admitted to hospital in Recife , Brazil , suffering abdominal pains .
X - rays showed that she was carrying a 20 inch long skeleton of a fetus which she conceived a decade earlier .
It had become lodged outside the womb and was never expelled from her body .
FEMALE SOFA
A 500 - lb. woman from Illinois was examined in the hospital .
During the examination , an asthma inhaler fell from under her armpit , a dime was found under one of her breasts , and a remote control was found lodged between the folds of her vulva .
OUCH !
A couple hobbled into a Washington emergency room covered in bloody restaurant towels .
The man had his around his waist , and the woman had hers around her head .
They eventually explained to doctors that they had gone out that evening for a romantic dinner .
Overcome with passion , the woman crept under the table to administer oral sex to the man .
While in the act , she had an epileptic fit , which caused her to clamp down on the man 's member and wrench it from side to side .
In agony and desperation , the man grabbed a fork and stabbed her in the head until she let go .
BABY CHICKEN
A 50 year old woman was brought into a New York emergency room complaining of abdominal pains .
During an examination , doctors found that the woman 's labia were pinned together with old safety pins .
Further inside , they found the dismembered body of a chicken .
The woman explained that she inserted the chicken pieces , convinced that they would grow into a baby .
SEX EDUCATION
A California doctor examining a young woman with abdominal pains asked her if she was sexually active .
She said that she was n't .
A later examination showed that she was pregnant .
Asked why she said that she was not sexually active , the woman replied ' I 'm not , I just lie there . '
When asked if she knew who the father was , with a puzzled look she replied , ' No . Who ? '.
BLIND DRUNK
A drunk staggered into a Pennsylvania ER complaining of severe pain while trying to remove his contact lenses .
He said that they would come out halfway , but they always popped back in .
A nurse tried to help using a suction pump , but without success .
Finally , a doctor examined him and discovered that the man did not have his contact lenses in at all .
He had been trying to rip out the membrane of his cornea .
GROWING SEASON
An old woman in a North Carolina ER complained of green vines growing from her vagina .
Investigation revealed a large potato trapped in her womb .
The woman then suddenly remembered that she had inserted it two weeks previously , because she thought that her uterus was falling out .
PRICKLY PAIR
In Michigan , a man came into the ER with lacerations to his penis .
He complained that his wife had ' a rat in her pussy ' and it bit him during sex .
After an examination of his wife , it was revealed that she had a surgical needle left inside her after a recent hysterectomy .
LAST STAND
A Cambridge man hobbled into the ER complaining of a permanent erection .
He admitted to doctors that while on holiday in Cuba , he frequented many brothels , and in one he was given some erectile cream to keep him hard .
He was told to use it sparingly .
However , since he was having so much fun , he kept using more and more .
By the time he came to the ER , all the blood vessels in his penis were swollen and his testicles had ballooned in size .
Doctors could do nothing except prescribe pain killers , and told him that it would return to flaccidity in a few days .
They also told him to enjoy his erection while it lasted , because it was going to be his last .
JUICY LUCY
In Kentucky , a woman complained of a purple discharge from her vagina .
She thought it might have something to do with the diaphragm that her doctor had recently given her .
' I followed all the instructions to the letter , ' she told her doctor , ' and used it with the jelly ' .
When asked which kind of jelly she had used , she replied ' grape ' .
BRUSH AFTER MEALS
A very unhygienic patient was being treated by two nurses for a burst vein in his stomach .
While changing the dressing , one of the nurses screamed .
They saw maggots crawling down the man 's chest .
They had been breeding between his teeth , and smelling the open wound , decided to feed further down his body .
CALL THE BUM SQUAD !
A World War II veteran came into a London clinic with a hemorrhoid problem .
One painful pile would often hang down from the man 's anus and he was in the habit of pushing it back up with an artillery shell .
On this occasion , the shell got stuck .
Doctors were going to remove it but the man told them the shell was still live .
So the hospital called in the army bomb disposal squad , who built a lead box around the man 's anus to defuse the shell so it could be removed .
KLINGONS AROUND URANUS
A 20 year old man came to the ER with a stony mass in his rectum .
He said that he and his boyfriend were fooling around with concrete mix , when his boyfriend had the idea of pouring the mix into his anus using a funnel .
The concrete then hardened , causing constipation and pain .
Under general anesthesia , a perfect concrete cast of the man 's rectum was removed ... along with a stray Ping - Pong ball .
This year , the Formula DRIFT pre-season open house and technical inspections were held at Universal Technical Institute ( UTI ) in Rancho Cucamonga , CA , about 40 miles east of downtown Los Angeles .
It was a nice event with a good turnout featuring all of the Formula D cars passing through a full day of live pre-race tech inspections at an indoor venue on 3 separate lifts at 40 minute intervals .
Two new models on the scene this year were in attendance – the Falken Tires Ford 2010 Mustang GT and the RMR / Redbull Hyundai Genesis Coupe .
One definite highlight and crowd favorite was watching another modified Mustang on a dyno screaming at a deafening pitch while the audience checked out the readouts on LCD screens above .
Oustide , there was a wide variety of drifting cars from various teams showcased along with a smattering of sponsor booths .
Universal Training Institute provides education on all things that go fast – automotive , diesel , motorcycle and marine .
At the event , if you were a prospective student , UTI offered tours and program information along with an opportunity to speak with both former and current students as well as faculty .
Some of the students are presently working with drift teams in the pit crews .
UTI seems like a great place to learn if you are interested in the high - performance , high - tech side of the automotive industry with clean state - of - the - art facilities and no lack of cars to tinker with .
It ’s definitely very different from your typical mechanic school .
UTI has Hod Rod U and Super Street courses in partnership with these magazines .
And they have strong ties with the OEMs ( including Audi , BMW , Mercedes , Porsche , VW and Volvo ) where dealers sponsor individual students to complete highly specialized programs that run anywhere from 8 to 27 weeks .
Overall it was a pretty low - key way to ease into the Formula D season which kicks off on Friday , April 10th at the Streets of Long Beach .
We will be providing full coverage of both the “ Preview Day ” and “ Main Event ” .
California NORML
Coordinator Dale Gieringer has an excellent commentary in support of California ’s proposed marijuana legalization bill in the Sunday edition of the Los Angeles Daily News .
Here ’s an excerpt :
Time has come to legalize pot
via The Los Angeles Daily News
Every year , the state shells out millions in taxpayers ’ dollars to arrest , prosecute and imprison marijuana offenders in a vain attempt to stamp out its use .
Meanwhile , legal and more dangerous drugs such as tobacco and alcohol are generating billions in revenues for the state .
… A new Zogby poll shows that 44 percent of voters now support taxing and regulating marijuana – and as many as 58 percent in the western states back legalization .
As usual , California is ahead of the rest of the nation .
Ammiano ’s bill provides a path - breaking blueprint for change that would benefit our economy , safety and freedom by making marijuana a winning proposition for California .
Ayman T. Quader
The old man sat in the light of a kerosene lamp and looked bleakly ahead .
His wife sat in the opposite corner , crying loudly “ They soiled our sheets , haram , haram , they broke our bed , fired guns in our bed ’ ‘ and ’ , the old man said ‘ they took all our money .
The day after we left we found a 100 shekel note in the garden , that ’s all ’
He was talking about the Israeli occupation of his house to a foreign photographer who had come to film the destruction in North of the Gaza Strip .
Sa’ad Al Atar lived in a line of houses along a high ridge overlooking Gaza city in Atatra district .
It was the part of Gaza nearest the Israeli border , and it also commanded long views of Gaza city , so it was bombed repeatedly in the first few days , and most of the houses were destroyed .
Then the Apaches fired rockets at what was left and machine gunned anything that moved .
Mr Al Atar stayed home with his family , even when machine gun fire came through the window and sprayed the wall behind them .
The foreign Journalist put his fingers in the big holes in the plaster , but to him they were just dents in the wall ; to Mr Al Atar they represented fear and salvation at the same time .
But there was an even closer miss in the next dark room , where there were no lights .
A row of smaller bullet holes at a lower level .
“ We were eating our meal on the floor when these came .
If we were sitting on a chair they would have gone through our heads .
I am lucky that I cannot afford to put chairs in both my rooms ” said Mr Al Atar .
What happened next ?
“ The Israelis came and pointed their guns at us .
they told us to get into the back room , where the shots had been fired , and to stay there , and they went on to the roof .
They told us that if we moved , they would shoot us .
They went upstairs , they stole my money , soiled the beds , left condoms everywhere .
They fired holes in the bed – for what ? ’
While people were dying they were making love with each other in our bed , and then they destroyed it .
All our money was in the mattress , everything for the whole family , and they took it all .
then after 3 days , they left .
Just left ”
His family of seven children and his wife listened in the gloomy light .
“ There is no glass in the windows , and we cannot afford even to buy plastic sheets ’ said Mrs Al Atar .
“ The UN gave us some blankets , but we have no money to repair anything and no one helps us .
No one .
And it is cold , even our clothes they cut up and soiled – look , look at these cuts , why , why they do this , why ? ”
They drank their tea in silence , the foreign photographer left , and the light went out .
Mrs. Al Atar
The Israelis have left us nothing , destroying our housed , stole our money and killed our young kids
We were all in one room when the bullets stated targeted us randomly
In an innocent softly voice , They have stolen my dreams and flee

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
A federal judge has ordered the Bush White House to preserve its e-mails , just days before a new administration takes over .
A federal judge has ordered the White House to reserve all e-mail from March 2003 to October 2005 .
The court 's preservation notice Wednesday stems from an ongoing lawsuit by private groups over allegedly missing electronic messages , and allegations the White House failed to properly monitor its internal communications among staff .
It has been a thorny legal and political issue for outgoing Bush officials , who are in the process of transferring more than 300 million e-mail messages and 25,000 boxes of documents to the National Archives .
U.S. District Judge Henry Kennedy instructed officials to search all White House workstations " and to collect and preserve all e-mails sent or received between March 2003 and October 2005 . "
Executive office personnel were also ordered to surrender any e-mail from that 31 - month period .
There was no immediate response from the White House , but officials said in the past they had succeeded in accounting for the electronic correspondence after much hard work .
The time period in question includes the start of the Iraq War , as well as the investigation into the leak of Valerie Plame Wilson 's identity as a CIA operative .
She is the wife of former diplomat Joseph Wilson , who publicly criticized the administration 's justification for invading Iraq .
The couple sued , claiming White House officials retaliated for his public stance by revealing her identity to reporters .
Groups who brought the lawsuit over the e-mails applauded the court order .
" There is nothing like a deadline to clarify the issues , " said National Security Archive Director Tom Blanton .
" In six days the Bush Executive Office of the President will be gone and without this order , their records may disappear with them .
The White House will complain about the last - minute challenge , but this is a records crisis of the White House 's own making . "
The civil cases are Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington v. Executive Office of the President ( 07 - 1707 ) and National Security Archive v. Executive Office of the President ( 07-1577 ) .

GREATER BANGKOK – High tide brings a rush of salt water into this seaside city , where sewers overflow many mornings and flood the streets .
While taxis slosh through filthy puddles , dozens of rusty pipes and generators begin pumping floodwaters back into the bay .
And by late morning , the pools have receded through gutter grates and the roads are dry .
Flooding is already a fact of life in Samut Prakan , this urban port roughly 16 kilometers ( 10 miles ) from Bangkok proper .
While many
Thais shrug off the flooding as an inconvenience , the country ’s top disaster specialist sees doom in the rising waters .
“ Right now , nothing is being done , ” says Meteorologist Smith Dharmasaroja , head of Thailand ’s National Disaster Warning Center .
“ And if nothing is ever done ?
Bangkok will be flooded . ”
For an animated look at Bangkok 's wetter future , click here :
By 2030 , much of Bangkok will lie under 1.5 meters ( 5 feet ) of seawater , Smith says .
It ’s a claim made doubly ominous by his history of predicting natural disasters .
In the late 1990s , he predicted that a tsunami would batter Thailand ’s coast .
Thousands will die , he said , if the government does n’t install an early warning system to alerting tourists and coastal dwellers .
In 2004 , this prophecy was tragically vindicated .
Ex -Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra helped pull Smith out of retirement to direct the newly founded disaster warning center .
To this day , his small office building is outfitted with massive wall maps , bays of monitors and red-alert hotlines — just in case a tsunami strikes again .
Smith ’s attention , however , is now fixed on floods .
Polar ice melting has the world ’s sea level rising at more than one - tenth of an inch per year , according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change .
Bangkok ’s steel and concrete buildings , which weigh down on soft clay underneath , are causing the capital to sink more than 3 inches per year on average , Smith says .
And many natural flood buffers , such as coastal mangroves , were replaced with cement long ago .
Those factors will conspire , Smith says , to flood Bangkok with seawater .
By his math , the low - lying city will take on more than .75 meters ( 2.5 feet ) of water every 10 years .
Along Bangkok ’s posh riverfront — a promenade of deluxe apartments and hotels — city workers are already dispatched to brace the shoreline with sandbags .
“ This is not a solution , ” Smith says .
“ It ’s temporary and it ’s a waste of time . ”
At Samut Prakan , practically walking distance from Bangkok ’s city limits , riverside pavilions are draped with ugly rubber tubing .
The bay view is spoiled by gas - powered generators and their corroded pipes , which gush floodwaters over the plaza ’s railing .
The city floods a little almost every morning at high tide , said Sarawut Kankamneard , a glassmaker who lives nearby .
“ When tide is high , water pressure builds up , ” he said .
“ It floods the sewers and runs into the city . ”
To hear Smith tell it , this is doomsday in its infancy .
In 2100 , by his projections , Bangkok will be Atlantis .
He is calling for a massive dike spanning the Gulf of Thailand , a roughly $ 2.8 billion USD project by his estimation .
But to save Bangkok , he insists , construction must begin almost immediately .
Biblical as Smith ’s predications may be , flooding is not on Thailand ’s national agenda .
To many politicians and scientists , Smith remains a nag .
To Bangkok business interests protecting the value of their riverfront property , he is an outright threat .
And while no one disagrees that Bangkok is sinking , other meteorologists strike a less urgent tone .
The urban coast outside Bangkok , dotted with thousands of piers and factories , will likely go underwater in coming decades , said Anond Snidvongs , director of the Southeast Asia Regional Research Center .
But the sea will flow and recede with Thailand ’s rainy and dry seasons , he says , leaving the area uninhabitable for only about 60 days a year .
“ It wo n’t be a permanent sea level rise , like we ’re in Neverland , ” he says .
Still ,
Anond says a slow retreat strategy is much more feasible than a huge dike , which will disturb the environment .
Building the dike , he says , would exceed the cost of a government - sponsored relocation drive for families living on the bay .
“ Do n’t try to save the shoreline , ” Anond says .
“ It ’s beyond hope . ”
Despite his cachet earned from predicting Thailand ’s tsunami , Smith remains a minor - league public figure .
Thailand ’s government is fragile and struggling to solve immediate problems , let alone crises that will haunt some future administration .
Smith knows politicians are unlikely to adopt his cause and build his dike .
“ All my life , I ’ve worked for the people , ” Smith says .
“ And I ’m attacked . ”
Even in Greater Bangkok , where seawater already runs in the streets , the flooding is tolerated .
With barges and navy vessels bobbing on the horizon , locals strolling along the waterfront sidestep the tubes that flush invading waters back into the bay .
“ It ’s actually nicer now , ” said Sarawut , the glassmaker .
“ If you could see what ’s underneath the water , it ’s all garbage anyway . ”

Homage to Raiders , pre-Davis
Recommended Video :
The NFL owners ' meetings in the Southern California luxury suburb Dana Point have produced a number of fascinating developments , but maybe the strangest of all is the potential for the glorious return of the Oakland Señors .
You probably missed all that with all the Jay Cutler non-news , did n't you ?
Yeah , that 's what we thought .
But amidst the other news - the new NFL - DirecTV deal that actually pays the league $ 1 billion a year even in 2011 when there might be a strike or lockout , the Brady Rule and the end of wedge blocking on kickoffs - the news on the Raiders ' place in the upcoming schedule sort of sneaks up on you .
And yet , there it is .
The Raiders , owners of the fewest wins since 2002 - and , even before that , perpetual antagonists with anyone who happened to have something they want - suddenly are among the league 's darlings .
Not only do they get a Thanksgiving Day game for the first time since 1970 , they do n't have to be ridiculed by being matched against the Lions .
Instead , they will play in the Cowboys ' new digs in Arlington , a perk of sorts as these things go .
Most intriguing of all is the way they were included as part of the first weekend 's AFL 50th - anniversary retrospective , with New England , Buffalo and San Diego .
And part of the news is that all four teams will wear throwback uniforms .
This is not normally news except in the case of the Raiders , who essentially have had the same uniforms since Al Davis swallowed the team in 1963 .
The only real innovation , if you want to call it that , was changing the white uniform 's numerals from black with silver trim to silver with back trim in the early 1970s .
Their throwback uniforms are their current uniforms , and their current uniforms look just as good on a black - and - white TV as they do in HD .
Unless ...

Unless the Raiders really are going to go full throwback and wear their true , original pre-Al duds .
The plain black helmets .
The gold trim rather than the silver .
The rounded numbers and the three sleeve and stocking stripes .
Maybe even the original logo , courtesy Remembertheafl.com , of the Raider with a mustache from the few days before the Raiders were the Raiders .
When they were the Oakland Señors .
This seems like such a small thing , but the idea that the Raiders might reference the dark ages before Davis is so radical that it makes the league 's decision to notice the Raiders at all seem tepid by comparison .
Raiders history , after all , is Al history , and the first three years of Raiders history were supervised by one of Al 's early enemies , Wayne Valley .
They were n't good years , to be sure - nine wins in three years , three different coaches , and three different homes .
Indeed , the franchise would not have existed at all had the NFL not decided to put an expansion team in Minneapolis .
The AFL originally wanted to put the Raiders ' franchise there , and turned to Oakland only after the Vikings were born .
But once
Al was lured by Valley to save the team from the verge of extinction , the clock was restarted , and nothing that happened pre-Al ever existed , except when it could be used to gild the Davis lily .
Fair enough .
The winners always write the history books , and the Davis Raiders did more than enough to get away with obscuring the early results by winning as often as they did .
The gold vanished , the black helmets vanished , and the Señors never actually made it past the consideration stage .
In other words , the opener would be the perfect time to bring it all back .
Having begun as dramatic agents of change , the Davis Raiders have been more resistant to it than any other franchise .
Going to a throwback outfit that is the same as the standard duds is to waste a rare opportunity to show that the franchise is actually capable of a sense of humor .
And hey , if the original uniform was good enough for Jim Otto , how can it be wrong for the current crop of non-Hall of Famers ?
We await developments .
That is , if there are developments to await .
We 'd love to think the Raiders are willing to play along with the rest of the party , but it has been so long since they 've gotten into the spirit of anything whimsical like throwback jerseys that this just might be one more view of the same old , same old .
Two words that have been killing them for the last six years : " same " and " old . "

Net tool tracks carbon footprint by ZIP code 1 / 1 Back to Gallery
San Francisco residents will get their first peek today at an inventive Internet - based tool that lets them track their personal carbon footprint and gauge how green their neighborhood is compared with the rest of the city .
The Web site at UrbanEcoMap.org was built by Cisco Systems Inc. , engineers using information such as trash collection , recycling rates and hybrid - car ownership to break down energy consumption and other environmental factors by Zip code .
For example , the map shows that Mayor Gavin Newsom 's neighborhood has the 10th lowest level of overall carbon emissions .
The interactive technology wo n't be available to San Francisco users until mid-May , but residents can check out a video that explains the Web site and how to use it starting today .
" We hear so much about climate change , but the challenge is either so abstract or so big that consumers do n't know what they can really do , " said Wolfgang Wagener , director of the connected urban development program for Cisco .
" The ecomap provides citizens with concrete , tangible access to information and resources with relevance to their daily life . "
San Francisco is the first city in the world to take advantage of the ecomap technology .
Amsterdam and Seoul will follow sometime this year .
The maps will be updated regularly as part of a 12 - month pilot project paid for by Cisco , which plans to transform the site to nonprofit status sometime in 2010 .
The Web site has been in development for about two years , said Jared Blumenfeld , director of the San Francisco environment department .
While Cisco designed the Internet platform for displaying the information and making the Web site interactive , city officials collected vast amounts of information from state and local resources that could be added to the map to create a more accurate carbon footprint for each neighborhood .
The site is divided into sections that break down carbon emissions by type - whether they come from transportation , energy use , or waste - as well as an overall picture .
Users are encouraged to look at specific information for their Zip code and then find ways to improve the carbon footprint .
A section on the Web site will help them find ways to bike to work , for example , or save energy by hanging clothes to dry .
There are even tools to help them map a bike route with the fewest hills or find a buddy to ride to work with .
" The holy grail of the intersection between the Web and the environment is to get real data that people can use to make decisions , " Blumenfeld said .
It 's not just individuals who can take advantage of the Web site , Blumenfeld said .
City officials are already fascinated by some of the trends they 've seen on the ecomap and will likely use the information there to effect policy change .
" I would never have guessed there are such big differences between neighborhoods , " Blumenfeld said .
" From a government perspective , it 's our job to find out how we can serve people better . "

BASRA , Iraq , March 31 ( UPI ) -- Britain turned over command in the Basra area of Iraq to the United States Tuesday , a prelude to the country withdrawing its remaining troops in the country .
At one point , British military personnel in Iraq numbered greater than 40,000 , The New York Times reported .
Most British troops are scheduled to leave Iraq by July .

At a ceremony in Basra , Maj. Gen. Andy Salmon of Britain 's Royal Marines turned over control of forces in the Basra area to U.S. Army Maj. Gen. Michael Oates .
Speaking at the handover ceremony , U.S. Army Gen. Ray Odierno , commander of American forces in Iraq , praised the British deployment in Iraq , the Times reported .
" None of this has been easy .
We have faced tremendous adversity , " he said .
" You have given the people of Iraq an opportunity to build a bright and prosperous future . "
Since 2003 , 179 British troops have died in Iraq .
Chip and PIN was meant to beat credit card fraud .
Guess what ?
It 's up 50 %
Fraud increase : Criminal gangs have found more ways to bypass chip and pin technology
Card fraud has leapt almost 50 per cent since the introduction of the chip and PIN system that was supposed to cut the problem .
The total hit a record high of £ 609.9 million in 2008 , which was 14 per cent up on the previous year .
More disturbingly , the figure has jumped by £ 182.8 million - 43 per cent - since the chip and PIN system became universal on Valentine 's Day in 2006 .
The surge in card fraud comes as the big banks are taking a tough line with victims and increasingly refusing to pay refunds .
At the same time the Home Office has decided that it is no longer the job of the police to record and investigate card fraud .
Now police forces across the country are directing victims to their banks , rather than mounting investigations .
The card fraud figures come from the banking industry trade body , APACS , which has also seen a 132 per cent annual rise in theft linked to online banking .
The introduction of chip and PIN , under which payments are authorised with a four - digit code rather than a signature , required an investment of more than £ 1 billion in new till machines .
The huge cost , passed on to shoppers in higher bills , was justified on the basis that it would drastically cut debit and credit card fraud .
However , the reality is that it has provided a springboard for a massive explosion in the cloning of cards .
Before the change , PINs were used at some 50,000 bank cash machines .
Now they are used at more than 900,000 tills , including high street stores and restaurants .
This has multiplied the opportunities for criminals to steal the PINs and the information on the magnetic stripe , which are needed to create copies .
Fraud linked to counterfeit or cloned cards hit £ 169.8 million in 2008 .
That was up by 18 per cent on 2007 and by 75 per cent compared to 2005 .
Security expert Professor Ross Anderson , of Cambridge University 's Computer Lab , said : ' The banks ' claims that chip and PIN would curb fraud was nothing but spin .
The reality is that the system is broken . '
He said the Government decision to switch reporting of card fraud from the police to the banks was a mistake .
' This totally unwarranted privatisation of the justice system means people just can't get these crimes investigated , ' he said .
The chip and PIN system does not deal with the problem of cards being used to make purchases via the internet , telephone or mail order .
Fraud in this sector totalled £ 328.4 million last year .
It has more than doubled over the last five years .
APACS said online banking fraud rose 132 per cent last year to a total of £ 52.5 million .
Criminals are finding ways to access the web bank accounts of victims to steal their cash .
Most often this is done through ' phishing ' where the criminals send out emails pretending to be from a person 's bank directing them to a bogus site where their access passwords are stolen .
However , there is also a problem where criminals implant spying software - malware - on the computers of their targets .

Updates to Left 4
Dead have been released .
The updates will be applied automatically when your Steam client is restarted .
The specific changes include :
NOTE : This is the second submission of this list .
The first submission proved quite unpopular because I ranked movies according to Rotten Tomatoes freshness and my decision to include The Sixth Sense , Batman : Mask of the Phantasm and Princess Mononoke .
The criticisms are well taken ; so , this is the list as I originally wrote it MINUS the three afore - mentioned movies .
To make it an even 20 , I threw Contact back in from an earlier version , even though I dislike the movie .
While the technical quality of sci- fi leapt forward during the 1990s , the decade features a depressing dearth of really good sci-fi in this post - Star Wars era .
Many of the movies that Hollywood produced in the 1990s made from great sci- fi books or other established source materials should have been better in execution — much better : The Postman , Starship Troopers , Contact , Sphere , The Phantom Menace , Lost in Space , Star Trek Generations , Judge Dredd , Aliens3 and Godzilla .
( Quick : What size was Godzilla when she was stomping round New York City ?
No one knew , especially that schlock - fest ’s producers . )
What follows is a selection of the best from the 1990s .
On the plus side , at least half of the movies that made the cut were not big - budget blockbusters .
And like the 1980s , some of the best sci-fi movies were Japanese anime .
Notable and deliberate omissions : Apollo 13 ( it ’s sci-FACT , not sci - fi ) ; the fun and quirky Being John Malkovich ( fantasy , not sci - fi ) ; Total Recall ( more dumb than good ) ; and Independence Day .
Despite the gee - whiz special effects , stirring speeches and fun characters , Independence Day was just stupid — as in unintelligent .
The three most egregious “ sins ” are : the techno - advanced aliens needing our puny satellite system to “ coordinate ” their attack , the massive mother ship exploding in close proximity to Earth with no damage to the planet , and Jeff Goldblum successfully hacking into the mother ship with his puny laptop .
Those three things ruin the experience .
20 The Arrival 1996
It took a while for this Charlie Sheen sci - fi thriller to grow on me .
Co-starring the late Ron Silver , The Arrival is a fast - paced sci- fi thriller featuring Sheen as radio astronomer Zane Ziminski who detects what appear to be alien signals .
Mysteriously fired for showing his findings , Ziminski gets thrown into a wild conspiracy that leads to a disturbing discovery .
It ’s actually better than it sounds , and as far as first contact - style movies go , The Arrival is superior to the haughty and overblown Contact and often - laughable Independence Day .
19 eXistenZ 1999
A strange mixture of cyberpunk with the then - hip tech of virtual reality , the British and Canadian eXistenZ skillfully explores the blurring of reality and fantasy .
Players literally jack into a virtual reality game by plugging a connection into their spine .
Talk about literally putting you in the game !
18 Contact 1997
I did n’t place Contact higher on the list for one very important reason : the characters are too one - dimensional .
For example , the motivation for Jake Busey ’s character to destroy the first “ Machine ” is laughably stupid .
In fact , the whole film — and Carl Sagan novel — seems like just one long , ridiculous and ignorant rant against religion .
Still , the film is intriguing and does n’t shy away from the real controversy : Did Jodie Foster ’s character actually travel through space in the blink of an eye ?
The final 15 or so minutes make sitting through the rest of the film worthwhile .
17 The Fifth Element 1997
Yes , this is a guilty pleasure , but unlike most other big - budget popcorn flicks , this movie never takes itself seriously .
The first time I saw this movie I had so much fun it did n’t matter how silly or incomprehensible it was .
The second time I tried to watch it with a critical eye , but wound up not caring again while I was having so much fun .
If you take this movie seriously ( like Independence Day ) , then you ’ll ridicule it as a piece of overblown garbage .
If you take it for a light - hearted , shoot - ‘ em - up , let ’s - have - fun - in - space popcorn flick , then it ’s a blast .
Bruce Willis stars as a world - weary cab driver ( are all heroes now “ world - weary ” ? ) and former elite soldier named Corbin Dallas — great name , by the way — who ends up the guardian / love interest of the “ supreme being , ” the universe ’s only hope from a gigantic sphere o’ pure evil .
It seems like the cast just had a blast making this movie , including Ian Holm as the bumbling priest , the late and great Byron James as Dallas ’ former CO , Gary Oldman as the wicked , evil , devilish industrialist bad guy , and Chris Tucker as Ruby Rhod , a spacey space - cadet of a 23rd century pop idol / diva .
And frankly , Chris Tucker is what makes this movie for me ( some people hate his character , though ) .
16 The Truman Show 1998
The Truman Show is an intriguing movie where Truman ( Jim Carrey ) lives out his entire life as an unwitting participant in a wildly popular reality TV show about his life .
But one day , a stage light falls from the “ sky ” and Truman begins to realize that his reality is not really reality .
( Say that 10 times fast . )
15 Star Trek : First Contact 1996
This eighth Star Trek voyage is the best one since 1982 ’s Wrath of Kahn , and the only ST film featuring the Next Generation cast that really appeals beyond Trek circles .
Heavy with overtones of Moby Dick , First Contact features our heroes battling the cybernetic Borg for the future of Earth .
A little corny in places ( Dr. Cochran says to the Enterprise crew members from the future : “ You ’re like astronauts … on some sort of star trek ! ” ) but overall , the script is good and the action exciting .
14 Men in Black 1997
Men in Black was a surprise 1990s monster hit , based on the comic of the same name .
It ’s pure popcorn , but ragingly good popcorn .
Agents K ( Tommy Lee Jones ) and J ( Will Smith ) of the Men in Black maintain earth as a “ Casablanca without the Nazis ” until a bug with a bad attitude ( Vincent D’Onofrio in a terrific performance ) arrives and starts some stuff .
More “ fi ” than “ sci , ” of course , but it ’s still one of the best fun sci - fi flicks of all time .
Best line :
When J puts on his black suit and shades for the first time , he tells K : “ The difference between you and me is I make this look good . ”
13 Jurassic Park 1993
Michael Crichton ’s tale of dinosaurs come alive through cloning introduced the world at large ( outside of certain scientific circles , of course ) to one of the greatest killing machines ever : the velociraptor .
With a gorgeous John Williams soundtrack , believable f/x and a typically — wonderfully — nerdy scientist performance by Jeff Goldblum ( Ian Malcolm ) Jurassic Park was and still is a terrific ride .
By necessity , the movie is thinner than the novel — and trying to figure out the landscape of the T - Rex attack scene will make your head spin .
( Where did that cliff come from that the heroes climb down ? )
Best line : Hammond tells Malcolm that “ All major theme parks have delays .
When they opened Disneyland in 1956 , nothing worked . ”
Malcolm replies , “ Yeah , but John , if the Pirates of the Caribbean breaks down , the pirates do n’t eat the tourists . ”
12 Edward Scissorhands 1990
One of the more imaginable sci- fi films in a long time , this fun fairy tale features Johnny Depp as a scientific experiment accidentally left unfinished when his creator ( the late great Vincent Price ) dies .
An Avon lady ( delightfully played by Dianne Wiest ) discovers the abandoned Edward , who still has several blades and scissors for hands and fingers .
Sort of an update of the Frankenstein story .
11 La Cité des enfants perdus The City of Lost Children , 1994
Quite a different movie than the others on this list , this French film depicts a dystopian society where a scientist kidnaps children to steal their dreams .
If you ’ve seen the director ’s weird post - apocalyptic “ Delicatessen , ” you kind of know what you ’re in for .
Somewhat grotesque , it ’s definitely not a run -of - the mill sci - fi psychological thriller .
10 Twelve Monkeys 1995
Bruce Willis stars as a convict sent back in time to help unravel the mystery of a super virus that ravaged earth in the mid-1990s .
His search centered upon a group of radical animal rights fanatics led by Brad Pitt — but is he on the right track ?
This well - received post - apocalyptic flick is based on 1962 ’s La Jetee .
( See my list on great sci - fi films of the 1960s . )
What I like about this film — other than the lovely Madeleine Stowe — is the fact that noting is quite as it seems .
9 Galaxy Quest 1999
This hilarious send - up of Star Trek is actually a fantastic adventures - in - space movie in its own right .
It ’s also a better Star Trek movie than most of the Star Trek movies .
Tim Allen plays the William - Shatner - like star of a defunct TV series called Galaxy Quest ( heh ) .
He and his former cast - mates spend time slumming at sci- fi conventions .
That is , until they ’re kidnapped by aliens who think the show was the real deal .
Totally rips / plays up great sci-fi and Trek stereotypes , such as Sigorney Weaver ’s character , who starred on Galaxy Quest as pure eye candy .
8 Gattaca 1997
Gattaca is a rare modern sci- fi movie that relies on thinking and serious themes instead of f/x and explosions .
Ethan Hawke stars as Vincent , who is born without the aid of genetic manipulation , and therefore becomes an instant outcast in a future society that values genetic manipulation before birth .
A “ god-child ” or “ faith - birth ” by purely natural means like Vincent is considered greatly inferior to “ valids . ” “ Imperfect ” Vincent ends up trading places with “ perfect ” Jerome , the former getting to become an astronaut and the latter actually getting to dream at night .
Well worth the time to watch .
7 Jin-Roh : The Wolf Brigade 1999
If you ’ve followed my lists of sci - fi films of each decade , you ’ll recognize that I favor films that depict a dystopian future .
Jin-Roh is my favorite such flick , and one of my all - time favorites of any genre .
Loosely based on a manga series , Jin-Roh is set in an alternate history of post - war Japan , where an elite force , called the Kerberos Panzer Cops , is an above - the - law paramilitary unit that combats domestic terrorism .
The protagonist , Kazuki Fuse , freezes when he confronts a “ red riding hood , ” a bomb courier for the terrorists .
The girl detonates the bomb , causing widespread damage ; a friend saves the frozen Kazuki from certain death .
Kazuki , ordered back to training , starts a tortured relationship with dead girl ’s twin sister .
Jin-Roh is beautifully made film — entirely hand - drawn ! — and is heavy with symbolism .
Panzer Cops are equipped like WWII German soldiers , right down to their helmets and MP - 42 heavy machine guns .
The wider story skillfully draws from the tale of Little Red Riding Hood — not the kid-friendly Grimm Brothers version , but the much darker original tale .
All - in - all , Jin-Roh is just superb .
6 ? ( or : Pi ) 1998
This well - received movie — a Sundance winner and somewhat obscure for popular audiences — is more psychological thriller than pure sc - fi .
And I ’d be on crack if I claimed I understood all of the theories and mathematics presented in this film .
Nevertheless , Pi ( ? ) deftly explores how the life of a paranoid and recluse mathematical theorist goes out of control when he stumbles upon a formula for predicting the stock market .
Contains a gruesome climax .
5 The Matrix 1999
While the second and third installments were such convoluted disappointments , the first Matrix movie was a mind - blowing trip .
Programmer / hacker Neo goes searching for The Matrix — but in the fine tradition of “ beware of what you wish for ; you may get it , ” Neo discovers that his reality is actually a construct of machines who use docile humans as a power source .
Neo comes to learn that he is “ the One ” who will end the machines ’ dominance once and for all .
Highly influential with its f/x .
4 Dark City 1998
A man wakes up in a hotel with no memory of who he is or what he ’s doing there .
He ’s soon on the run from beings called “ the Strangers ” and comes to realize he has psychokinetic powers .
The Strangers , who can alter reality , time and memory , are actually parasitic aliens who are experimenting the nature versus nurture aspects of humanity .
( Is a person ’s natural state more important to what makes a human who and what he is , or is nurturing — life experiences — more important ? )
Some have dubbed Dark City “ the thinking man ’s Matrix . ” Roger Ebert declared Dark City the best movie of 1998 .
3 Open Your Eyes 1997
This Spanish sci - fi thriller was well - received and celebrated when it was released .
A man , Cesar , is horribly disfigured in an accident and begins to have many disorienting experiences .
After he murders a woman he thinks is his ex-lover , Cesar learns that after the accident he was cryogenically frozen — with some seriously disturbing implications .
Open Your Eyes was remade in 2001 as Vanilla Sky — with both versions starring Penelope Cruz — but the original is better .
Ranked # 84 on the wide - ranging Online Film Critics Society ’s Top 100 Sci-Fi Films list .
2 Ghost in the Shell 1995
If Akira was the anime triumph of the 1980s , Ghost in the Shell takes props for the 1990s .
In fact , this cyberpunk sci - fi film is such a mind - trip that its influence is hard to underestimate .
Like most great anime , Ghost in the Shell takes its inspiration from the manga of the same name .
And like the best of all sci-fi , Ghost in the Shell seriously explores what it means to be human in a time of super - science .
Motoko Kusanagi and her partner , Batou , are cyborgs who fight high - tech criminals .
She chases after the elusive “ puppet master ” in her quest for existential meaning .
Absolutely not to be missed .
And yes , it ’s violent in places , but quite deep .
Originally , this was # 1 on my list , but I moved it to number 2 at the last moment .
1 Terminator 2 : Judgment Day 1991
This is one of the greatest sci- fi movies of all time , and it ’s # 1 for two reasons : First , T2 is a rare sequel that improves upon the original , and second , T2 actually goes beyond the explosions and gee - whiz to make you think .
In T2 , Arnie ’s T - 800 terminator goes back in time to protect John Connor , not kill him .
The antagonist is the T - 1000 , made of liquid metal , ably played by Robert Patrick .
What actually makes this movie great is not the action or the fun lines — although they are fantastic — but its exploration of humanity .
Pay attention to Sarah Connor ’s thoughts in the middle , where she says that the machine proves to be a good “ father ” to John .
And Linda Hamilton ’s second turn as Sarah Connor is not a one - dimensional , wilted - flower - makes - good type of character she was in the first film .
Here , she is moody , brooding and full of horrible visions of the future that lead her to the brink of savagery .
Her reaction immediately after shooting up the scientist ’s home is just a great piece of film - making .
And who can forget the horrifying nuclear war dream segment ?
Towards the end of the clip the presence of another missile on the launcher which happily is a drill missile .
If it were a war shot , I do n't think there 'd have been a dry pair of y fronts on board .

SHANGHAI — Ford may be standing taller than General Motors in Detroit these days — flush with cash while its rival is forced to go repeatedly to Washington , hat in hand , seeking government bailouts .
But in China the tables are turned .
G.M. is a powerful presence here with 8 to 10 percent of the market for cars , minivans and sport utility vehicles , making it the second - largest automaker in China for such vehicles , passed only by Volkswagen .
One of G.M. ’s local joint ventures , Wuling , dominates the sale of bare - bones pickups and vans , hugely popular in rural areas , with nearly half the market .
And in discussions about a possible bankruptcy to break G.M. into a “ good G.M. ” of viable businesses and a “ bad G.M. ” composed of the rest of the automaker , the company ’s Chinese operations are consistently mentioned as a candidate for the good G.M .
Unlike the gas guzzlers churned out by G.M. ’s North American operation , the company ’s China division has emphasized fuel - sipping models in the last decade .
Two weeks ago , G.M. set a target of roughly doubling sales in China within five years , to two million vehicles a year .
What * bangs head on desk * was * bang * I * bang * thinking ?
I tried KDE4 before , I did n’t like it .
I downgraded back to KDE3 just to get something that worked .
I know my new toy upgraded to Intrepid without problems , but that was running Xubuntu , not KDE , so why did I think that a quick apt - get dist - upgrade to Kubuntu 8.10 was going to work on the machine I have all my precious , precious data on ?
Argh !
This is becoming unacceptable .
The whole point of an upgrade is to improve the functionality of the system .
In my case , the Intel wifi driver was happily causing kernel panics and locking the machine solidly , with only a sadly flashing caps lock light to indicate that it was n’t merely “ thinking about it ” , that it was really right off the deep end into la- la - land and was n’t going to make it home for supper .
Ubuntu forums indicated that the problem is fixed in Intrepid , and it ’s been out for a good few months now , long enough to work out the kinks .
Right ?
Yeah , right .
Not only is the problem not fixed , it ’s far far worse – kernel panics every five minutes or so in fact .
That ’s unbelievable .
I had fewer panics than that while writing device drivers for 2.4 for crying out loud .
Worse , nothing else works properly either .
KDE4 design choices aside , things like menus and submenus render by blotting out a chunk of the screen and then filling it , so you get this distorted and torn section of the screen for a half - second or less before the menu appears .
That ’s just klunky .
Bluetooth , it turns out , does n’t work at all .
It ’s in the release notes .
Along with a dozen other failings .
Look kubuntu folks , a little word here .
A system as large as bluetooth – an entire networking stack – not working , that does n’t go in the release notes .
It is meant to stop you from releasing at all .
You do not release something so fundamentally broken because then noone will ever trust your software in future .
It ’s like the first KDE4 release where proxy support was n’t available in networking , so every machine behind a commercial or university firewall could n’t work .
It ’s stupid and lazy and sloppy to release something that is so widely used in so fundamentally broken a state .
This is why most of us abandoned windows at some point – unstable , buggy crap for software does n’t allow you to just get on with doing work .
For crying out loud people , stop playing with stupid eye candy and flashy crap until the basic infrastructure is working , would you ?
Yes , I like compiz , I like the spinny cube , I like the wobbly windows , it ’s all wonderful .
It ’s just that I need to be able to actually do some work in the windows , not just wobble them about as I drag them around the spinning cube , y’know ?
I ’m starting to side with the linux hater blog these days because of things like this .
I ca n’t even back out the change and go back to Hardy and KDE3 without hours of work .
I ’m sick to death of having to think of defensive stratagies to use against the people maintaining distributions these days .
What , I have to partition off my / home from the rest of my disk so when I upgrade and it goes wrong I can reinstall without losing data ?
I could try virtualising my entire PC so that if the upgrade goes bad I can recover ?
Would you *” £& off ?!!!
I ’m not virtualising my entire PC because I ’m not paying for a fast laptop to make it into a slow laptop in software , and I do n’t know how much diskspace my data will use or my apps , so I ’m not going to partition them apart in case it makes more work for me down the line .
And I should n’t have to do it either , we invented directories and hierarchial filesystems in the 1970s for a reason and this is it dammit !
I ’m so damn sick of stuff that looks cool but does n’t just work .
It sucks down the time I want to use to do my work .
And as designs go , that ’s just broken .
Driving through Todmorden , West Yorkshire , Robert Jones followed his GPS navigator , as he normally does .
But what he did n't know was that his navigator had decided Robert needed to die .

He continued following the steep path that the navigator told him was kosher , and totally where he wanted to be going .
Suddenly , he hit a guardrail .
Jones stopped immediately , so that his car was left hanging off the edge of a cliff .
Jones said , " I just trusted the satnav .
It kept insisting that the path was a road even as it was getting narrower and steeper .
I rely on my satnav , I could n't do without it for my job .
I guess I 'm lucky the car did n't slip all the way over the edge .
But it has been a bit of a nightmare . "
The ironic part ?
Police arrested Jones .
They charged him with " driving without due care and attention , " even though the real crime here , attempted murder , was clearly committed by the GPS .
The lesson here is that you should at least occasionally look out the window when you 're driving , if only because your GPS navigator might want you dead .

People do not get any more racially prejudiced as they age — but they do become less able to hide it , suggests a new study by researchers at UC Davis , the University of Freiburg and the University of Sydney .
The study , which assesses biases among whites toward blacks , appears in this month 's issue of the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology .
During the four - year study , the American , German and Australian researchers asked more than 15,000 whites between the ages of 11 and 94 to take a test that involved associating black and white faces with the words “ pleasant ” and “ unpleasant ” as rapidly as possible .
" We found that it 's easier for younger people to pair pictures of black faces with positive words than it is for older people , " said Jeffrey Sherman , professor of psychology at UC Davis and an author of the new study .
" One possible explanation for this is that older people , because they grew up in less tolerant times , have more negative associations with black faces than do younger people .
Another is that negative associations are present across the age spectrum , but older people are less able to overcome them when pairing faces with words .
" By analyzing the errors people made on this face - word test , we were able to separate these potential explanations — and determine that older people indeed do not have more negative associations , but are , in fact , less able to overcome them . "
The association persisted even when the researchers corrected for such factors as education , gender and motivation to complete the task .
" Our study points to an important social challenge , " Sherman said .
" As the population ages , biased behavior may become an increasingly common social problem . ”

It is not going to look anything like Jon Stewart disemboweling a cowering Jim Cramer , but CNN will devote the bulk of its news effort this week to covering issues related to the global economic troubles .
Jonathan Klein , president of CNN ’s domestic networks , said the network would fill all the “ optional time , ” that is , between breaking news , this week with financial reporting and analysis that reflects “ a cool , collected approach . ”
That message is consistent with the channel ’s intention to brand itself as the news channel that delivers information without what it would describe as the partisan flavorings of Fox News Channel ( right ) and MSNBC ( left ) .
All of CNN ’s programs will present coverage and guests related to financial topics like the housing market , employment and investments .
Mr. Klein said all of CNN ’s reporting units , including its medical department and entertainment reporters , will contribute special material .
The international channel will cover the global impact , centering on reports from London and Hong Kong .
CNN has devoted single days to coverage of a topic , like race relations and autism , but Mr. Klein said this will be the first time CNN has thrown all its resources against one subject for a week .
THE Catholic Archbishop of Sydney , Cardinal George Pell , made use of one of the holiest days in the Christian calender yesterday to support the Pope 's controversial claim that condoms worsen the spread of HIV and AIDS .
The Catholic Archbishop of Sydney said on morning television yesterday that condoms " encourage promiscuity " and were not the solution to the AIDS epidemic .
" The idea that you can solve a great spiritual and health crisis like AIDS with a few mechanical contraptions like condoms is ridiculous , " he said on Sky News .
The cardinal said the different rates of AIDS in Catholic and non-Catholic countries in Asia showed why spirituality , not condoms , was needed .
" If you look at the Philippines you 'll see the incidence of AIDS is much lower than it is in Thailand , which is awash with condoms .
There are condoms everywhere and the rate of infection is enormous . "
In an unprecedented wave of gun violence , B.C. 's Lower Mainland was rocked by four shootings Tuesday night , including two fatal .
In the first , in Burnaby , a woman was shot dead and a man seriously injured in a shooting that took place on the 25th floor of a luxury high - rise on Madison Avenue at Dawson , near Lougheed Highway .
It happened just after 8 p.m. Burnaby RCMP locked down the building , not allowing people to enter or leave .
The Integrated Homicide Investigation Team says it 's too early to say if the shooting is gang or drug - related .
" This could be domestic related for all we know , " said Cpl. Dale Carr .
In the second , Surrey RCMP went to the scene of another shooting in South Surrey , on 68th Avenue at 130th Street , in an incident that took place after 8 p.m .
Police say a man in his early 20s is now in stable condition in hospital with gunshot wounds .
RCMP say gunfire was reported in the region only days earlier .
And Vancouver police confirmed a fatal shooting at East 3rd Avenue and Kaslo Street at around 10 p.m..
The male Indo - Canadian victim is in his mid 20s and was slumped over the wheel of his vehicle .
Insp. Bob Thompson of the Vancouver Police says the incident is likely a targeted shooting and the victim had blood all over his face .
He said officers arriving at the scene spotted a car with its emergency lights flashing and glass littering the street .
Police used sniffer dogs to cover a wide area near the Vancouver shooting for several hours after the incident , but have not identified any suspects .
Mounties were called a Surrey neighbourhood to reports of gunfire and found nothing but shell castings , later Tuesday night a man in his twenties arrived at a Surrey hospital for treatment of gunshot wounds .
Surrey RCMP are also investigating a drive - by shooting that that damaged a home at 110th Ave. and 155th St. just before midnight .
No one was hurt but the residence was peppered with bullets .
Late Tuesday night , Surrey RCMP told CTV
News they were trying to determine if the first two incidents were connected .
A growing problem
The latest wave of violence comes only a day after RCMP announced " a significant strike against B.C. gangs " with the arrest of alleged UN gang leader Barzan Tilli - Choli , 26 , of Vancouver .
RCMP E-division Deputy Commissioner Gary Bass said Tuesday weapons and attempted murder charges have been approved against two members of the UN gang , along with one associate and two women .
The suspects were arrested this weekend following a six - month joint investigation by both the Vancouver Police and RCMP .
Last week , Prime Minister Stephen Harper visited Vancouver to fuel his government 's push for Criminal Code changes that would sentence gangsters to longer stretches in prison .
B.C.'s Lower Mainland has been rocked by 24 targeted shootings in a month -- 11 of them fatal .
WASHINGTON  President Obama ’s economic stimulus plan includes about $ 1 billion to help local governments hire more police officers , which would resurrect a Clinton administration program that had been largely shelved by President George W. Bush .
The so - called COPS Program , for Community Oriented Policing Services , aimed to add 100,000 police officers to local departments in eight years .
Whether it met that goal is the subject of heated debate in law enforcement and public policy circles .
Mr. Bush , reflecting a Republican philosophical objection to having the federal government pay for local police salaries , all but eliminated the program .
Senator Patrick J. Leahy , the Vermont Democrat who is chairman of the Judiciary Committee , said money to hire police officers was an appropriate part of the stimulus bill because it would aid the economy “ as fast as , or faster than , other spending . ”

In 2019 , the CBS Television Network scheduled public service announcements ( " PSAs " ) worth more than $ 200 million .
A key part of this commitment was and continues to be the CBS Cares campaign , which was launched in 2000 and consists of PSAs featuring Talent from many CBS programs .
These PSAs have addressed numerous causes , including Alcohol Abuse , Alzheimer 's Disease , the Arts , Autism , Bipolar Disorder , Breast Cancer , Cervical Cancer , Child Abduction , Child Advocacy , Children 's Health , Colon Cancer , Depression , Disaster Relief , Diversity / Tolerance , Drug Abuse , Education , Epilepsy , Heart Disease , HIV / AIDS , Holocaust Remembrance , Identity Theft , Menopause , Mentoring , Obesity , Osteoporosis , Parenting , Pet Adoption , Post Traumatic Stress Disorder , Prostate Cancer , Schizophrenia , Stroke Prevention , Suicide Prevention , Violence Prevention ( including Spousal and Child Abuse ) , and the V - Chip .
Development of CBS Cares is supervised by the Program Practices Department in New York , which works with the Promotions Department .
With Network PSAs as its fulcrum , CBS Cares has grown into a multimedia project involving many areas and talents at CBS : Entertainment , News , Sports , Digital Media , Radio , Communications , and Marketing .
While there are some core causes that have been addressed for years , CBS Cares is also committed to looking for under - served causes where we believe that the resources and talents within CBS can make a difference .
The starting point for every PSA — before scripting begins — is close consultation with experts on the frontline of each field to learn what messages they feel are the most important to convey .
This website is intended to provide additional information on certain causes that are the subjects of our on - air PSAs .
We have tried to provide the basics for each cause as well as important information that may not be widely known .
Of course , we are broadcasters and the information in this website is educational only and not a substitute for viewers / readers consulting with experts , including their own physicians in the case of health and medical issues .
We hope that you will find our website to be of interest and value .
Kind regards ,

Besides coffee , caffeine is found in tea , energy drinks and chocolate People who drink too much coffee could start seeing ghosts or hearing strange voices , UK research has suggested .
People who drank more than seven cups of instant coffee a day were three times more likely to hallucinate than those who took just one , a study found .
A Durham University team questioned 200 students about their caffeine intake , the journal Personality and Individual Differences reported .
However , academics say the findings do not prove a " causal link " .
They also stress that experiencing hallucinations is not a definite sign of mental illness and that about 3 % of people regularly hear voices .
" This is the first step toward looking at the wider factors associated with hallucinations , " said psychology PhD student Simon Jones , who led the study .
Under stress
He said previous research had suggested factors such as childhood trauma could be linked to hallucinations .
When under stress , the body releases a hormone called cortisol which is produced in greater quantities after consuming caffeine .
The extra cortisol boost could be what causes a person to hallucinate .
Therefore , Mr James added , it made sense to examine the link between caffeine and mood .
Besides coffee , sources such as tea , chocolate , " pep " pills and energy drinks contain caffeine .
After asking the students about their typical intake , the research team assessed their susceptibility to hallucinatory experiences and stress levels .
Pregnancy problems
Among the experiences reported were seeing things that were not there , hearing voices , and sensing the presence of dead people .
However , Mr James stressed more work was needed to pin down the link .
He said : " Stressed people may simply drink more caffeine . "
And he added : " Even if caffeine were responsible for hallucinations in some way , the part it plays would be small compared to other factors in life . "
The researchers now plan to investigate whether other aspects of diet , such as sugar and fat consumption , might be associated with hallucinations .
Dr Euan Paul , of the British Coffee Association , stressed the study only focused on people with a very high caffeine intake .
He also said no details were recorded of other substances consumed that might have had hallucinogenic effects .
" There are literally thousands of well conducted published studies looking at all aspects of the coffee , caffeine and health debate and the overall conclusion clearly demonstrates that moderate caffeine intake , 400 - 500 mg per day , is safe for the general population and may even confer health benefits . "
Recent research has linked high caffeine intake among pregnant women to miscarriage or low birth weight .
Other studies suggested it could help prevent skin cancer , reduce nerve damage associated with multiple sclerosis , or cause problems for diabetes sufferers .
The Durham study was funded by the Economic and Social Research Council and Medical Research Council .

Top architecture practice Aedas is one of five taking part in the challenge
Five of Scotland 's top architecture practices have accepted a challenge to design a building out of Lego .
Prospect magazine said the project was designed to show " how even the humble plastic brick can be turned into a work of architecture in the right hands " .
The Lego buildings will be displayed at the Scottish Design Awards Nominations Exhibition on Wednesday .
The designs , which will also be shown at the Lighthouse in Glasgow , will be auctioned off for charity in May .
The winner of the Lego challenge will be announced at the Scottish Design Awards Gala Dinner on 29 May .
The money raised from the auction of the buildings will go to the National Autism Society Scotland .
Please turn on JavaScript .

The five practices involved were : Aedas , Gareth Hoskins Architects , gm+ad , Michael Gilmour Associates and RMJM .
Gordon Young , editor of Prospect , said : " We were amazed at the ambition and scale of some of the entrants .
" We had tower blocks , big blocks and plain odd blocks .
" It 's amazing to think all the teams started out of standard Lego building bricks .
Imagine what could have been achieved if they were working with real bricks . "
Despite the credit crunch the real Scottish Design Awards , which cover disciplines which range from building design to graphic design , have seen record entry levels this year .
Buildings in the running for the top awards include : the Beatson Cancer Research Building in Glasgow , Quartermile in Edinburgh and Moore Street Housing in Glasgow 's Gallowgate .

Pope Benedict XVI is a man of enormous authority .
When he says " do n't use condoms - even to prevent the spread of Aids " it has a significant impact among tens , even hundreds of millions of people .
Getting on for a fifth of Africans are Roman Catholic .
The Church has been growing more quickly in Africa than anywhere else , and this is the Pope 's first visit there in the four years he has been the spiritual leader of the world 's approximately one billion Catholics .
With Africans - 22 million of whom are infected with HIV - hanging on his every word , that made his statement aboard the plane heading to Cameroon this week all the more significant .
There is something at stake that is greater even than the fight against Aids
Pope condemns condoms : Your views The Pope said the " cruel epidemic " should be tackled through fidelity and abstinence rather than condoms , and that " the traditional teaching of the Church has proven to be the only failsafe way to prevent the spread of HIV / Aids " .
An awareness of the Pope 's huge position of strength has sharpened the criticism of his remarks , by others with a more liberal approach to preventing the transmission of HIV .
Rebecca Hodes , working in South Africa for the Treatment Action Campaign , was among the most trenchant critics .
She described Pope Benedict 's remarks as " alienating " , " ignorant " and " pernicious " .
Better lives
The Pope says HIV / Aids threatens economies and societies The Pope is echoing the teaching of his predecessor , Pope John Paul II , whose own advocacy of abstinence was also fiercely criticised , and led to accusations even that he was responsible for the spread of disease .
The Church 's case has not been helped in the past when senior figures - including the president of the Vatican 's Pontifical Council for the Family , Cardinal Alfonso Lopez Trujillo - have insisted that HIV inevitably passes through holes in the latex from which condoms are made , a claim dismissed by the World Health Organization .
However , the Church 's concern about condoms is only part of wider teaching aimed at allowing people to live better , more fulfilled lives .
It believes that encouraging people to use condoms to minimise the worst effects of behaviour that in itself impoverishes their lives is to fail them .
Pope Benedict put it this way not long after he took office in 2005 .
He told African bishops that contraception was among trends leading to a breakdown in sexual morality .
" It is of great concern that the fabric of African life , its very source of hope and stability , is threatened by divorce , abortion , prostitution , human trafficking and a contraception mentality . "
In other words , there is something at stake that is greater even than the fight against Aids - particularly as , in the Church 's view , condoms are not as effective as abstinence in combating this deadly infection .
Cultural objections
It is not as though Pope Benedict underestimates HIV , acknowledging that " the virus seriously threatens the economic and social stability of the [ African ] continent " .
Pope 's visit raises hopes Can Catholicism help Africa ?
However , Catholics point out that if a couple , one of whom had the virus , consistently used a condom they would reduce the yearly risk of passing it on to the uninfected partner by about 87 % - which they say falls well short of an adequate means of disease prevention .
Uganda used a policy combining abstinence , fidelity and - only if necessary - the use of condoms , to achieve a significant reduction in the spread of HIV .
Even some senior Roman Catholics take a pragmatic view of the use of condoms .
The Belgian Cardinal Goddfried Daneels said in 2004 that using a condom with the intention of stopping disease was morally different from using one to prevent the creation of life .
He said condoms could be the lesser of the two evils .
Father Gerry O'Collins , Emeritus Professor at the Gregorian University in Rome , said the commandment ' thou shalt not kill ' , " trumps other issues " .
The Catholic aid agency Cafod is bound to uphold the official teaching of the Church , and it makes clear that it does not fund or advocate the supply , distribution or promotion of condoms .
However , Cafod also points out that condoms are particularly effective for people such as prostitutes who are at highest risk of infection .

Aid agencies can find that their biggest challenge is trying to overcome cultural objections to using condoms .
It could be that the way Pope Benedict chose to repeat the Church 's teaching about contraception , even at a time when Aids is rampant , was also significant .
He could have included the issue in a major homily at a high - profile mass .
The fact that he dealt with it in the plane to Africa , answering questions from journalists , could be seen as a subtle distancing of his message from realities on the ground .

US CA : Column : Cannabis Craziness Is Ending
by Kevin L. Hoover , ( 04 Mar 2009 ) Arcata Eye California
It 's as though eight years in , the 21st century has finally begun .
Of course we need sustainable energy .
Of course we need an equitable tax policy .
Of course we need a logical model for health care .
And transportation , and the environment , and education , and agriculture , and the economy .
Of course .
All the pent - up obsolescence of the old ways is finally collapsing , and the more changey things get , the more popular our new president becomes .
That change may include the demise of Reefer Madness as we know it , and we know it all too well in Arcata .
When I interviewed deputy drug " czar " Scott Burns last year , I was flabbergasted at the tragicomically superstitious state of his beliefs .
This beltway Bushie 's retrograde rhetoric was infuriating , since the ignorant and counterproductive federal pot policies have been mainly served as price - support program for the illegal cannabis industry .
The government 's unimaginably stupid approach to this particular drug may finally be ending , 50 years after it should have .
First , the U.S. attorney general has signaled an end to raids on medical cannabis facilities , most of which are just marijuana stores .
But the proprietors ' relief could be short - lived , because the old - school paradigm that kept the profit in the faux - medical cannabis establishment may be on its way out as well .
A serious move is afoot in the State Assembly to legalize cannabis , and it might , just might finally rescue us from the cockamamie patchwork of legacy laws that 's distorting and degrading our community .
If legalization comes to pass , it will be as much because the government needs the tax revenue as any notion of logic or fairness .
They need the money , so now we see the prohibition beginning to crumble .
It will be just excellent to see the entrenched gray - market medical cannabis industry try to fight reform and keep the big bucks flowing .
Watch their whole sham schema - the fake clinics , the Dr. Feelgoods , the for - profit 215 grows - evaporate once cannabis is legal .
Meanwhile , the first wave of grow house busts came down last week .
And now that APD is set up for it , there will be more .
Those who , lured by large , tax - free dollars , ruin residences , endanger Arcata neighborhoods and gamble their and their families ' futures on lax law enforcement now have to worry about not whether , but when the cops will come charging in .
The era of Arcata as grow house sanctuary is over , and last week 's raids are already changing the game .
Homes which have had been internally shuttered for years suddenly have open windows , with non-halide light shining out .
One has a new " FOR RENT " sign on it .
Maybe an actual family will move in and enroll their kids in one of our depopulated elementary schools .
It 's fairly safe to assume that the government will get legalization wrong on some levels , but one thing we ought to insist on is that those with medical need and others who want to grow on a sensible scale ( no whole - house conversions ) for casual personal use are allowed to do so , just as some people make delectable beer and wine at home .
Part of the romance of Arcata is its counterculture , which is undeniably cannabis tinged .
But the recent profit - driven saturation , involving wholesale transformation of the town into a marijuana monoculture , is anything but healthy for Arcata , its people and other living things .
Everything from our greenhouse gas output to solid waste diversion efforts to availability of housing has been heavily impacted , mostly off the books and without public process .
Cannabis craziness has pitted neighbor against neighbor , corrupted property managers , criminalized entrepreneuers , ruined and depleted housing stock , invited organized crime into neighborhoods , threatened public safety , wasted police resources , shattered lives and turned many against legitimate medical and recreational use - among innumerable other negative impacts .
End the madness .
Save our neighborhoods .
Legalize freedom .
Legalize marijuana .
Of course .

Capcom envisions ' unique ' Resident Evil game for Wii U
Revelations director Koushi Nakanishi says there are " lots of things I 'd like to try out " on Nintendo 's new console for future entry in series .
I have learned that one thing you can predict from members of the Bush - Cheney administration is a total lack of remorse .
In Jay Bybee , you have an almost classic case from Hannah Arendt : a mild - mannered creature of the Republican establishment , trained into supine subservience when dealing with executive authority , and able to compartmentalize anything in his own mind to please his superiors and bask in the warm embrace of the institutional , ideological right .
So even though he allegedly privately described his lawyering in matters “ so awful , so terrible , so radioactive ” they would never be uncovered , he gave Cheney everything he could possibly want , and more .
As to his " good faith , " I believe , from reading his execrable memo , that the only good faith he showed was in finding ways to give his political masters anything they wanted .
Let me give a simple small example , helpfully laid out here .
Bybee was able to defend waterboarding as non-torture in a legal memo ostensibly providing objective analysis of the case history of the torture technique in the US .
Among the obvious precedents for such a decision was the most recent case - when the Reagan administration Justice Department prosecuted a Texas sheriff and his deputies for waterboarding a suspect to get a confession in 1983 :
At the trial of the Texas sheriff , Assistant US Attorney Scott Woodward said the prisoners who were subjected to waterboarding were not " model citizens , " but they were still " victims " of torture .
" We make no bones about it .
The victims of these crimes are criminals , " Woodward said , according to a copy of the trial transcript .
One of the " victims " was Vernell Harkless , who was convicted of burglary in 1977 .
Gregg Magee , a deputy sheriff who testified against Sheriff Parker and three of the deputies said he witnessed Harkless being handcuffed to a chair by Parker and then getting " the water treatment . "
" A towel was draped over his head , " Magee said , according to court documents .
" He was pulled back in the chair and water was poured over the towel . "
Harkless said he thought he was " going to be strangled to death , " adding : " I could n't breathe . "
One of the defendants , Deputy Floyd Allen Baker , said during the trial that he thought torture to be an immoral act , but he was unaware that it was illegal .
His attorneys cited the " Nuremberg defense , " that Baker was acting on orders from his superiors when he subjected prisoners to waterboarding .
The Reagan Justice Department - back when Republicans opposed torture - did not buy this defense and neither did a jury .
They convicted the the deputy on three counts of civil rights and constitutional violations .
Now : this case occurred before the UN Convention on Torture went into effect , but any good faith legal memo explaining the history of this particular torture technique would surely have cited it .
It 's easily findable with Google , let alone with the research resources available to the Office Of Legal Counsel .
For the first time since the establishment of Israel in 1948 the government is facing serious allegations of war crimes from respected public figures throughout the world .
Even the secretary general of the United Nations , Ban Ki-moon , normally so cautious about offending sovereign states – especially those aligned with its most influential member , the United States – has joined the call for an investigation and potential accountability .
To grasp the significance of these developments it is necessary to explain what made the 22 days of attacks in Gaza stand shockingly apart from the many prior recourses to force by Israel to uphold its security and strategic interests .
In my view , what made the Gaza attacks launched on 27 December different from the main wars fought by Israel over the years was that the weapons and tactics used devastated an essentially defenceless civilian population .
The one - sidedness of the encounter was so stark , as signalled by the relative casualties on both sides ( more than 100 to 1 ; 1300 - plus Palestinians killed compared with 13 Israelis , and several of these by friendly fire ) , that most commentators refrained from attaching the label “ war ” .
The Israelis and their friends talk of “ retaliation ” and “ the right of Israel to defend itself ” .
Critics described the attacks as a “ massacre ” or relied on the language of war crimes and crimes against humanity .
In the past Israeli uses of force were often widely condemned , especially by Arab governments , including charges that the UN Charter was being violated , but there was an implicit acknowledgement that Israel was using force in a war mode .
War crimes charges ( to the extent they were made ) came only from radical governments and the extreme left .
The early Israeli wars were fought against Arab neighbours which were quite literally challenging Israel ’s right to exist as a sovereign state .
The outbreaks of force were of an inter- governmental nature ; and even when Israel exhibited its military superiority in the June 1967 six day war , it was treated within the framework of normal world politics , and though it may have been unlawful , it was not criminal .
But from the 1982 Lebanon war this started to change .
The main target then was the presence of the Palestine Liberation Organisation ( PLO ) in southern Lebanon .
But the war is now mainly remembered for its ending , with the slaughter of hundreds of unarmed Palestinian civilians in the refugee camps of Sabra and Shatila .
Although this atrocity was the work of a Lebanese Christian militia , Israeli acquiescence , control and complicity were clearly part of the picture .
Still , this was an incident which , though alarming , was not the whole of the military operation , which Israel justified as necessary due to the Lebanese government ’s inability to prevent its territory from being used to threaten Israeli security .
The legacy of the 1982 war was Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon and the formation of Hizbullah in reaction , mounting an armed resistance that finally led to a shamefaced Israeli withdrawal in 1998 .
This set the stage for the 2006 Lebanon war in which the announced adversary was Hizbullah , and the combat zone inevitably merged portions of the Lebanese civilian population with the military campaign undertaken to destroy Hizbullah .
Such a use of hi-tech Israeli force against Hizbullah raised the issue of fighting against a hostile society with no equivalent means of defending itself rather than against an enemy state .
It also raised questions about whether reliance on a military option was even relevant to Israel ’s political goals , as Hizbullah emerged from the war stronger , and the only real result was to damage the reputation of the IDF as a fighting force and to leave southern Lebanon devastated .
The Gaza operation brought these concerns to the fore as it dramatised this shift away from fighting states to struggles against armed resistance movements , and with a related shift from the language of “ war ” to “ criminality ” .
In one important respect , Israel managed to skew perceptions and discourse by getting the media and diplomats to focus the basic international criminal law question on whether or not Israeli use of force was “ disproportionate ” .
This way of describing Israeli recourse to force ignores the foundational issue : were the attacks in any legal sense “ defensive ” in character in the first place ?
An inquiry into the surrounding circumstances shows an absence of any kind of defensive necessity : a temporary ceasefire between Israel and Hamas that had been in effect since 19 July 2008 had succeeded in reducing cross - border violence virtually to zero ;
Hamas consistently offered to extend the ceasefire , even to a longer period of ten years ; the breakdown of the ceasefire is not primarily the result of Hamas rocket fire , but came about mainly as a result of an Israeli air attack on 4 November that killed six Hamas fighters in Gaza .
Disproportionate force ?
In other words , there were no grounds for claiming the right of self - defence as Israel was not the object of a Hamas attack , and diplomatic alternatives to force existed and seemed credible , and their good - faith reliance was legally obligatory .
On this basis the focus of legal debate should not be upon whether Israeli force was disproportionate .
Of course it was .
The focus should be on whether the Israeli attacks were a prohibited , non-defensive use of force under the UN charter , amounting to an act of aggression , and as such constituting a crime against peace .
At Nuremberg after the second world war , surviving Nazi leaders were charged with this crime , which was described in the judgment as “ the supreme crime ” encompassing the others .
The Gaza form of encounter almost by necessity blurs the line between war and crime , and when it occurs in a confined , densely populated area such as Gaza , necessarily intermingles the resistance fighters with the civilian population .
It also induces the resistance effort to rely on criminal targeting of civilians as it has no military capacity directly to oppose state violence .
In this respect , the Israeli attacks on Gaza and the Hamas resistance crossed the line between lawful combat and war crimes .
These two sides should not be viewed as equally responsible for the recent events .
Israel initiated the Gaza campaign without adequate legal foundation or just cause , and was responsible for causing the overwhelming proportion of devastation and the entirety of civilian suffering .
Israeli reliance on a military approach to defeat or punish Gaza was intrinsically “ criminal ” , and as such demonstrative of both violations of the law of war and the commission of crimes against humanity .
There is another element that strengthens the allegation of aggression .
The population of Gaza had been subjected to a punitive blockade for 18 months when Israel launched its attacks .
This blockade was widely , and correctly , viewed as collective punishment in a form that violated Articles 33 and 55 of the Fourth Geneva Convention governing the conduct of an occupying power in relation to the civilian population living under occupation .
This policy was itself condemned as a crime against humanity , as well as a grave breach of international humanitarian law .
It also had resulted in serious nutritional deficiencies and widespread mental disorders on the part of the entire Gaza population , leaving it particularly vulnerable to the sort of “ shock and awe ” attack mounted by Israel from land , air and sea .
This vulnerability was reinforced by Israel ’s unwillingness to allow Gaza civilians to seek safety while the tiny Strip was under such intense combat pressure .
Two hundred non-Palestinian wives were allowed to leave , which underscored the criminality of locking children , women , the sick , elderly and disabled into the war zone , and showed its ethnically discriminatory character .
This appears to be the first time in wartime conditions that a civilian population was denied the possibility of becoming refugees .
In addition to these big picture issues , there are a variety of alleged war crimes associated with Israeli battlefield practices .
These charges , based on evidence collected by human rights groups , include IDF firing at a variety of civilian targets , instances where Israeli military personnel denied medical aid to wounded Palestinians , and others where ambulances were prevented from reaching their destinations .
There are also documented claims of 20 occasions on which Israeli soldiers were seen firing at women and children carrying white flags .
And there are various allegations associated with the use of phosphorus bombs in residential areas of Gaza , as well as legal complaints about the use of a new cruel weapon , known as DIME , that explodes with such force that it rips body parts to pieces .
These war crimes concerns can only be resolved by factual clarifications as to whether a basis exists for possible prosecution of the perpetrators , and commanders and political leaders to the extent that criminal tactics and weaponry were authorised as matters of Israeli policy .
In this vein too are the Israeli claims relating to rockets fired at civilian targets and to Hamas militants using “ human shields ” and deliberately attacking from non-military targets .
Even without further investigation , it is not too soon to raise questions about individual accountability for war crimes .
The most serious allegations relate to the pre-existing blockade , the intrinsic criminality and non-defensiveness of the attack itself ; and the official policies ( eg confinement of civilian population in the war zone ) have been acknowledged .
The charges against Hamas require further investigation and legal assessment before it is appropriate to discuss possible arrangements for imposing accountability .
A question immediately arises as to whether talk of Israeli war crimes is nothing more than talk .
Are there any prospects that the allegations will be followed up with effective procedures to establish accountability ?
There are a variety of potentially usable mechanisms to impose accountability , but will any of these be available in practice ?
This issue has been already raised by the Israeli government at the highest levels in the form of official commitments to shield Israeli soldiers from facing war crimes charges .
The most obvious path to address the broader questions of criminal accountability would be to invoke the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court established in 2002 .
Although the prosecutor has been asked to investigate the possibility of such a proceeding , it is highly unlikely to lead anywhere since Israel is not a member and , by most assessments , Palestine is not yet a state or party to the statute of the ICC .
Belatedly , and somewhat surprisingly , the Palestinian Authority sought , after the 19 January ceasefire , to adhere to the Rome Treaty establishing the ICC .
But even if its membership is accepted , which is unlikely , the date of adherence would probably rule out legal action based on prior events such as the Gaza military operation .
And it is certain that Israel would not cooperate with the ICC with respect to evidence , witnesses or defendants , and this would make it very difficult to proceed even if the other hurdles could be overcome .
The next most obvious possibility would be to follow the path chosen in the 1990s by the UN Security Council , establishing ad hoc international criminal tribunals , as was done to address the crimes associated with the break - up of former Yugoslavia and with the Rwanda massacres of 1994 .
This path seems blocked in relation to Israel as the US , and likely other European permanent members , would veto any such proposal .
In theory , the General Assembly could exercise parallel authority , as human rights are within its purview and it is authorised by Article 22 of the UN charter to “ establish such subsidiary organs as it deems necessary for the performance of its function ” .
In 1950 it acted on this basis to establish the UN Administrative Tribunal , mandated to resolve employment disputes with UN staff members .
The geopolitical realities that exist within the UN make this an unlikely course of action ( although it is under investigation ) .
At present there does not seem to be sufficient inter-governmental political will to embark on such a controversial path , but civil society pressure may yet make this a plausible option , especially if Israel persists in maintaining its criminally unlawful blockade of Gaza , resisting widespread calls , including by President Obama , to open the crossings from Israel .
Even in the unlikely event that it is established , such a tribunal could not function effectively without a high degree of cooperation with the government of the country whose leaders and soldiers are being accused .
Unlike former Yugoslavia and Rwanda , Israel ’s political leadership would certainly do its best to obstruct the activities of any international body charged with prosecuting Israeli war crimes .
Claims of universal jurisdiction Perhaps the most plausible governmental path would be reliance on claims of universal jurisdiction ( 1 ) associated with the authority of national courts to prosecute certain categories of war crimes , depending on national legislation .
Such legislation exists in varying forms in more than 12 countries , including Spain , Belgium , France , Germany , Britain and the US .
Spain has already indicted several leading Israeli military officers , although there is political pressure on the Spanish government to alter its criminal law to disallow such an undertaking in the absence of those accused .
This path to criminal accountability was taken in 1998 when a Spanish high court indicted the former Chilean dictator , Augusto Pinochet , and he was later detained in Britain where the legal duty to extradite was finally upheld on rather narrow grounds by a majority of the Law Lords , the highest court in the country .
Pinochet was not extradited however , but returned to Chile on grounds of unfitness to stand trial , and died in Chile while criminal proceedings against him were under way .
Whether universal jurisdiction provides a practical means of responding to the war crimes charges arising out of the Gaza experience is doubtful .
National procedures are likely to be swayed by political pressures , as were German courts , which a year ago declined to proceed against Donald Rumsfeld on torture charges despite a strong evidentiary basis and the near certainty that he would not be prosecuted in the US , which as his home state had the legally acknowledged prior jurisdictional claim .
Also , universal jurisdictional proceedings are quite random , depending on either the cooperation of other governments by way of extradition or the happenchance of finding a potential defendant within the territory of the prosecuting state .
It is possible that a high profile proceeding could occur , and this would give great attention to the war crimes issue , and so universal jurisdiction is probably the most promising approach to Israeli accountability despite formidable obstacles .
Even if no conviction results ( and none exists for comparable allegations ) , the mere threat of detention and possible prosecution is likely to inhibit the travel plans of individuals likely to be detained on war crime charges ; and has some political relevance with respect to the international reputation of a government .
There is , of course , the theoretical possibility that prosecutions , at least for battlefield practices such as shooting surrendering civilians , would be undertaken in Israeli criminal courts .
Respected Israeli human rights organisations , including B’Tselem , are gathering evidence for such legal actions and advance the argument that an Israeli initiative has the national benefit of undermining the international calls for legal action .
This Israeli initiative , even if nothing follows in the way of legal action , as seems almost certain due to political constraints , has significance .
It will lend credence to the controversial international contentions that criminal indictment and prosecution of Israeli political and military leaders and war crimes perpetrators should take place in some legal venue .
If politics blocks legal action in Israel , then the implementation of international criminal law depends on taking whatever action is possible in either an international tribunal or foreign national courts , and if this proves impossible , then by convening a non-governmental civil society tribunal with symbolic legal authority .
What seems reasonably clear is that despite the clamour for war crimes investigations and accountability , the political will is lacking to proceed against Israel at the inter - governmental level , whether within the UN or outside .
The realities of geopolitics are built around double standards when it comes to war crimes .
It is one thing to proceed against Saddam Hussein or Slobodan Milosevic , but quite another to go against George W Bush or Ehud Olmert .
Ever since the Nuremberg trials after the second world war , there exists impunity for those who act on behalf of powerful , undefeated states and nothing is likely to challenge this fact of international life in the near future , thus tarnishing the status of international law as a vehicle for global justice that is consistent in its enforcement efforts .
When it comes to international criminal law , there continues to exist impunity for the strong and victorious , and potential accountability for the weak or defeated .
It does seem likely that civil society initiatives will lead to the establishment of one or more tribunals operating without the benefit of governmental authorisation .
Such tribunals became prominent in the Vietnam war when Bertrand Russell took the lead in establishing the Russell Tribunal .
Since then the Permanent Peoples Tribunal based in Rome has organised more than 20 sessions on a variety of international topics that neither the UN nor governments will touch .
In 2005 the World Tribunal on Iraq , held in Istanbul , heard evidence from 54 witnesses , and its jury , presided over by the Indian novelist Arundhati Roy , issued a Declaration of Conscience that condemned the US and Britain for the invasion and occupation of Iraq , and named names of leaders in both countries who should be held criminally accountable .
The tribunal compiled an impressive documentary record as to criminal charges , and received considerable media attention , at least in the Middle East .
Such an undertaking is attacked or ignored by the media because it is one - sided , and lacking in legal weight , but in the absence of formal action on accountability , such informal initiatives fill a legal vacuum , at least symbolically , and give legitimacy to non-violent anti-war undertakings .
The legitimacy war
In the end , the haunting question is whether the war crimes concerns raised by Israel ’s behaviour in Gaza matters , and if so , how .
I believe it matters greatly in what might be called “ the second war ” – the legitimacy war that often ends up shaping the political outcome more than battlefield results .
The US won every battle in the Vietnam war and lost the war ; the same with France in Indochina and Algeria , and the Soviet Union in Afghanistan .
The Shah of Iran collapsed , as did the apartheid regime in South Africa , because of defeats in the legitimacy war .
It is my view that this surfacing of criminal charges against Israel during and after its attacks on Gaza resulted in major gains on the legitimacy front for the Palestinians .
The widespread popular perceptions of Israeli criminality , especially the sense of waging war against a defenceless population with modern weaponry , has prompted people around the world to propose boycotts , divestments and sanctions .
This mobilisation exerts pressure on governments and corporations to desist from relations with Israel , and is reminiscent of the worldwide anti-apartheid campaign that did so much to alter the political landscape in South Africa .
Winning the legitimacy war is no guarantee that Palestinian self - determination will be achieved in the coming years .
But it does change the political equation in ways that are not fully discernable at this time .
The global setup provides a legal framework capable of imposing international criminal law , but it will not be implemented unless the political will is present .
Israel is likely to be insulated from formal judicial initiatives addressing war crimes charges , but will face the fallout arising from the credibility that these charges possess for world public opinion .
This fallout is reshaping the underlying Israel / Palestine struggle , and giving far greater salience to the legitimacy war ( fought on a global political battlefield ) than was previously the case .

The remains of an exploding star have been reconstructed in a 3D image for the first time , say scientists .
Astronomers , including one at Cardiff University , used medical imaging techniques to help create the hologram of Cassiopeia A. Dr Haley Gomez , from the university 's physics and astronomy school , said it provided " an amazing insight into the original explosion of the star " .
The image shows disc - shaped jets came out from the star as it exploded .
ONION - LAYER DIAGRAM
Each of the different components in the 3D reconstruction relates to a layer in the onion - skin structure of the progenitor star .
The outer carbon layer came off spherically , driving a spherical blast wave that sets up a spherical reverse shock
The inner neon / oxygen , silicon / argon ( yellow ) , iron ( green ) layers came off flattened with high velocity plumes and jets that caused distortions in the reverse shock Source : Cardiff University Astronomers knew that plumes and jets emerged from stars but the broad , disc - like structure is a new discovery .
The international team used x-ray images and infrared data to create the visualisation and get a more complete understanding of the explosion .
Cassiopeia
A is a supernova remnant , the debris from a star that blew itself apart some 11,000 light - years from Earth .
The light from the explosion is thought to have first arrived at Earth about 330 years ago .
Dr Gomez said the reconstruction was " really extraordinary " .
" Astronomers and the public are used to seeing flat 2D pictures , far removed from our everyday 3D life .
" Now , we can visualise an object 11,000 light - years away from different angles . "
The project was led by Dr Tracey DeLaney of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , US .
She said : " We have always wanted to know how the pieces we see in two dimensions fit together with each other in real life .
Now we can see for ourselves with this ' hologram ' of supernova debris . "
In the film , released by the astronomers , the green region is mostly iron observed in X - rays .
The yellow region is a combination of argon and silicon seen in X - rays , optical , and infrared - including jets of silicon .
The red region is cold debris seen in the infrared .
Finally , the blue reveals the outer blast wave , most prominently detected in X - rays .

Enlarge By Elise Amendola , AP Greg Epstein , left , the humanist chaplain at Harvard University , laughs with students after a group meeting on campus in Cambridge , Mass. , March 6 .
Harvard sophomores , from left , are Kelly Bodwin , Lewis Ward , Andrew Maher and Greta Friar .
Epstein envisions local humanist centers nationwide that perform many of the community - building functions of a church , only in service of the humanist creed , which he sums up as a commitment to living ethical , personally fulfilling lives while serving the greater good .
COMPARE CHANGES IN U.S. RELIGIONS OVER 2 DECADES COMPARE CHANGES IN U.S. RELIGIONS OVER 2 DECADES FAITH & REASON FAITH & REASON Blog : Join the conversation on religion , spirituality and ethics | Forum : Debate fellow readers CAMBRIDGE , Massachusetts 
The monthly schedule is church - like , with its parenting classes , guest speakers and small group meetings to hash out shared beliefs .
But God is n't part of this Cambridge congregation .
Greg Epstein , the humanist chaplain at Harvard University , is building a God - free model of community that he hopes helps humanists increase in numbers and influence across the United States .
SURVEY : Most religious groups in USA have lost ground in 20 years Epstein sees potential in research showing that there are a growing number of people in the United States with no religion .
In the latest American Religious Identification Survey , released this month , 15 % of respondents in 2008 said they had no religion , compared to 8.2 % in 1990 .
Epstein believes that group includes large numbers of people who are humanist , but have never identified themselves that way and can be reached .
At the same time , there is broader acceptance of those with no faith , as indicated by President Barack Obama 's mention of " nonbelievers " in his inaugural address , Epstein said .
Definitions of humanism vary .
Generally , humanists reject belief in the supernatural and are guided by reason , experience and compassion for others .
Epstein defines the philosophy as a commitment to living ethical , personally fulfilling lives while serving the greater good .
Epstein wants to create local humanist centers nationwide that perform many of the community - building functions of a church , only in service of the humanist creed .
He will promote his idea as he tours the country to promote his book , " Good Without God , " which is scheduled to be published by HarperCollins in the U.S. later this year .
Epstein will receive assistance and funding from groups such as the American Humanist Association and the Secular Student Alliance , which have chapters they hope to strengthen and multiply .
" There are so many millions of people out there who basically share our views , that we 've got room for everybody , " Epstein said .
" What we 're doing here has got to grow even more . "
Raised as a Reform Jew , Epstein studied Taoism and Buddhism before he became a humanist .
He earned a master 's degree in Judaic studies from the University of Michigan and a master 's of theological studies from Harvard Divinity School .
In 2005 , he was ordained as a rabbi by the International Institute for Secular Humanistic Judaism .
The movement says it combines reason , human experience , Jewish culture and ethical insights from Jewish tradition .
While many humanists reject anything that hints at organized religion , Epstein is freely borrowing from it — from the " small group " format familiar in evangelical churches to calling his group a " congregation . "
Paul Kurtz , founder of the Council for Secular Humanism , disagrees with that approach , saying humanists are building secular communities that show people do n't need religion to get together " in a joyful mood and do good works . "
But that 's undermined when religious words are used to describe those communities .
" I do n't think we should use the language of religion , that 's very confusing , " Kurtz said .
Though he supports Epstein , Fred Edwords of the American Humanist Association questions whether a large , untapped pool of potential humanists exists who would join congregations .
" This is a new mission field , if you will , but are those vineyards ripe for the picking ? "
Edwords said .
" I have n't seen sufficient evidence of it . "
Still , both men agree that more humanist communities are needed , for mutual support and to offset isolation humanists often feel .
Jenni Acosta , a humanist from Newton , Massachusetts , who is part of the Harvard humanist parenting group , said the group gives her needed support , and shows her 6 - year - old and 10 - year - old daughters that other children are being raised the same way .
Acosta , 36 , said she deals with family and friends who challenge her on how she can raise her kids without the moral guidance a faith provides .
" I think it 's reassuring to all of us to know that we 're there for each other and there 's other examples of people doing it and their kids seem to be turning out OK , " Acosta said .
The parenting group started in December and meets monthly with about 10 families .
Acosta says trips to museums and a parenting course called " Compassionate Communication " are planned .
The Harvard chaplaincy also hosts " Humanist Small Group " biweekly Sunday brunch discussion and buys drinks at biweekly " Humanist Community Pub Nights . "
Last month , it hosted holiday - style celebrations around Charles Darwin 's 200th birthday and is hosting a talk by humanist writer and director Joss Whedon of " Buffy the Vampire Slayer " fame .
Richard Lints , a professor of philosophical theology at Gordon - Conwell Theological Seminary , a prominent evangelical school in Hamilton , Massachusetts , said the humanist desire for greater community is understandable .
He believes God " hard - wired " humans to need it .
But he said he doubts humanism can sustain itself in the local congregations Epstein envisions because community is not a natural part of humanism , where the individual is the ultimate source of meaning .
If humanism becomes concerned with the " greater good , " and a sort of natural moral order that implies , it starts to resemble religion and humanists will back away , he said .
" At the heart of the humanist project is deep individualism , " Lints said .
" It 's always going to be difficult to sustain a real robust community . "
To those who say it can't be done , Epstein points to his community at Harvard , and nonstop requests for more services , as a rebuttal .
He believes humanists are responsible to make sure their community grows more .
" Salvation is here on earth , " he said .
" We have evolved over 14 billion years without purpose .
Now we want purpose , we need to build it into our own lives . "

A Brazilian archbishop says all those who helped a child rape victim secure an abortion are to be excommunicated from the Catholic Church .
The girl , aged nine , who lives in the north - eastern state of Pernambuco , became pregnant with twins .
It is alleged that she had been sexually assaulted over a number of years by her stepfather .
The excommunication applies to the child 's mother and the doctors involved in the procedure .
The pregnancy was terminated on Wednesday .
Abortion is only permitted in Brazil in cases of rape and where the mother 's life is at risk and doctors say the girl 's case met both these conditions .
Police believe that the girl at the centre of the case had been sexually abused by her step - father since she was six years old .
The fact that she was pregnant with twins was only discovered after she was taken to hospital in Pernambuco complaining of stomach pains .
Her stepfather was arrested last week , allegedly as he tried to escape to another region of the country .
He is also suspected of abusing the girl 's physically handicapped older sister who is now 14 .
Intervention bid The Catholic Church tried to intervene to prevent the abortion going ahead but the procedure was carried out on Wednesday .
Now a Church spokesman says all those involved , including the child 's mother and the doctors , are to be excommunicated .
The Archbishop of Olinda and Recife , Jose Cardoso Sobrinho , told Brazil 's TV Globo that the law of God was above any human law .
He said the excommunication would not apply to the child because of her age , but would affect all those who ensured the abortion was carried out .
However , doctors at the hospital said they had to take account of the welfare of the girl , and that she was so small that her uterus did not have the ability to contain one child let alone two .
While the action of the Church in opposing an abortion for a young rape victim is not unprecedented , it has attracted criticism from women 's rights groups in Brazil .

All mosques have a niche indicating the direction of the Kaaba
Some 200 mosques in Islam 's holiest city , Mecca , point the wrong way for prayers , reports from Saudi Arabia say .
All mosques have a niche showing the direction of the most sacred Islamic site , the Kaaba , an ancient cube - like building in Mecca 's Grand Mosque .
But people looking down from recently built high - rises in Mecca found the niches in many older mosques were not pointing directly towards the Kaaba .
Some worshippers are said to be anxious about the validity of their prayers .
There have been suggestions that laser beams could be used to make an exact measurement .
Tawfik al - Sudairy , Islamic affairs ministry deputy secretary , downplayed the problem in remarks quoted by the pan -Arab newspaper al - Hayat .
" There are no major errors but corrections have been made for some old mosques , thanks to modern techniques , " he said .
" In any case , it does not affect the prayers . "
Footage raises new questions about Pakistan attack Agence France - Presse
Published : Thursday March 5 , 2009

LAHORE , Pakistan ( AFP ) - Pakistan faced new questions about its security forces Thursday as dramatic footage emerged of the cricket attackers making a leisurely getaway from the scene of their deadly assault .
The images of the gunmen calmly walking off , without police or security forces chasing them , will add to the speculation swirling around the brazen daytime attack on Sri Lanka 's cricket team Tuesday that left eight people dead .
Pakistan is steeped in political violence , and suspicion has fallen on Islamic militants linked to Al - Qaeda and the Taliban .
Police have brought in around two dozen people for questioning but say none are linked to the attack .
Up to 12 men attacked the convoy of umpires , coaches and players with automatic weapons , grenades and a rocket launcher as it made its way to the cricket ground in the city of Lahore .
The attackers fled without a trace .
The new footage , captured by closed - circuit cameras , showed two suspects wearing rucksacks and ambling down the road , apparently untroubled after the carnage took place .
They then jump on motorbikes and speed off .
" We are doing our best to unravel the conspiracy , " Lahore police chief Habib - ur Rehman told AFP .
" Raids are being mounted , leads are being followed , " he said .
" We believe we are on the right track in the investigation . "
Police released sketches of four suspects but have not made any breakthroughs in the case .
No one has claimed responsibility for the assault , which killed six police and two civilians , and wounded 19 people .
More than 1,600 people have been killed in attacks in Pakistan over the past 22 months , and Al - Qaeda and Taliban militants have forged a de facto safe haven in the country 's rugged and lawless northwest along the border with Afghanistan .
For decades , Pakistan 's ISI military intelligence agency has fostered Islamist militant groups in Kashmir and Afghanistan , and there are suspicions that some ISI elements have links to militants inside the country .
Chris Broad , one of the umpires who was to work the cricket match , angered officials after saying Pakistan security forces had left the convoy vehicles like " sitting ducks . "
" We were promised high level security and in our hour of need , that security vanished , " he told reporters in Britain .
Broad said the Sri Lanka and Pakistan team buses had left together on the first two days of the Test .
" On this particular day , the Pakistan bus left five minutes after the Sri Lankan bus .
Why ? " he said .
" It went through my mind as we were leaving the hotel : ' Where is the Pakistan bus ? ' "
Simon Taufel , an Australian umpire caught in the attack , said their bus had been left unprotected once the assault began .
" You tell me why supposedly 20 armed commandos were in our convoy and when the team bus got going again , we were left on our own ?
I do n't have any answers to these questions . "
Seven Sri Lankan cricketers and a coach were among 19 people wounded .
" It was precisely because of police valour and bravery that the Sri Lankan team and the international umpires survived , " said Rehman , the Lahore police chief .
Pakistan has a long history of political violence that goes unsolved .
Former premier Benazir Bhutto was assassinated in December 2007 , and many here have expressed doubts whether the killers will ever be brought to justice .
Tuesday 's attack was also a serious blow for cricket in Pakistan , where millions follow the game passionately , and has deepened the isolation of a country now shunned by much of the world cricket community .
The Bangladesh Cricket Board announced Thursday that Pakistan 's cricket tour of Bangladesh scheduled to start later this week has been postponed .
New Zealand has indicated a tour of Pakistan set for November will likely be called off , and the International Cricket Council has raised doubts about whether Pakistan will still be a co-host for the sport 's 2011 World Cup .
Among the wounded Sri Lanka players , Tharanga Paranavitana , who had a bullet lodged in his chest , and Thilan Samaraweera , who had shrapnel in his right leg , underwent surgery back home .
All were expected to make a full recovery .

The French government resurrected its " Cr�ation et Internet " three - strikes bill today after suffering a stunning defeat some weeks back , and it does n't mean to make the same procedural mistakes twice .
The bill must go through another round of parliamentary debate , but it looks set to pass sometime in May .
In the meantime , however , the European Parliament plans to pass a major telecom overhaul that just might make the French approach to online copyright infringement illegal .
And , as if the pure political situation were n't crazy enough , the grassroots groups opposing the graduated response law plan to stage May Day marches in protest .
" Cr�ation et Internet " has been talked about for years , and was supposed to pass last month .
Taking passage for granted , most deputies left the lower chamber during the vote .
At the last moment , though , 15 Socialists swarmed in from the hallway , voted against the bill , and defeated it 21 - 15 — a shockingly small number of votes for such a crucial piece of legislation .
The bill is now back in the National Assembly for a second reading , according to French newspapers , and its backers do n't sound ready for anything like " compromise " after being tricked the first time around .
If it passes , the bill would create a new administrative authority called HADOPI to handle copyright infringement notices ; HADOPI could then choose to warn or disconnect Internet users , placing them on a national Internet blacklist .
But the European Parliament is n't keen on the idea , and has voted several times to basically ban such practices without judicial oversight .
MEPs like France 's Guy Bono have repeatedly sought to make the issue part of the massive " Telecom Package " reform bill that will reshape Europe 's telecom architecture , but Parliament 's bills need to pass muster with the European Council before becoming law .
The Council , made up the various EU member states , has opposed ( under French leadership ) most attempts to restrict Internet disconnection rules .
Today , though , it appears that a compromise has been reached in principle between Parliament and the Council .
Reuters notes that the Telecom Package will now contain a line about cutting off Internet access only when an " impartial and independent tribunal " agrees .
This deal is broader than past attempts to get judges involved , but narrower than Council ideas about letting any " legal authority " oversee disconnections .
But will it ban HADOPI ?
No one seems quite sure , and it's not clear that the full Parliament will even go along with the compromised text .
Guy Bono yesterday railed against the attitude of his own government , which was acting " contraire � l'esprit europ�en " by refusing to go along with Parliament 's will .
While the politicians clash , ' Net heads are taking action of their own .
Sci - fi writer Roland Wagner , for instance , has organized his fellow scribes into a " Sci-fi against HADOPI " group , while the French Data Network organizes a May 1 protest march through the streets of Paris .
Being against HADOPI is one thing , but having a positive vision in place for the overhauling of copyright is another .
Consumer groups including La Quadrature du Net and UFC Que Choisir have joined forces to launch Cr�ation Public Internet ( a play on the bill 's title ) , a project devoted to finding new business models and thinking about the important questions of cultural creation and artist income .
Yesterday , they held a meeting in a National Assembly conference room to launch their new platform and kickstart a very different sort of debate on HADOPI , copyright , and the Internet .
Why Gold Owners Are Targets of the Government
If you own gold , you are in a war .
You are under assault .
You had better figure this out early .
There is a full - scale war against you .
The politicians and central bankers who are conducting this war against you are determined to see that you lose money on your investment .
I have written a detailed report on this : The Gold Wars . "
You can download it free of charge here :
The reason why you are under assault is because you have demonstrated by your purchase of gold or a gold - related investment that you do not trust the monetary policies of your nation 's central bank .
If you are an American , this means you do not trust the monetary policies of the Federal Reserve System .
You have taken a step that confirms your lack of trust in the government and its central bank .
If you think the government and the central bank will sit quietly , while millions of citizens buy gold as a way to hedge against government and central bank policies , you are terminally naive .
A PERPETUAL WAR
Governments and central banks for almost a century have done whatever they could to keep citizens from using gold as a way to hedge their economic futures against the taxation policies of the government and the inflation policies of central banks .
The war escalated a few days after the outbreak of World War I in August of 1914 .
At that time , central banks authorized commercial banks to cease redeeming paper money for gold at a fixed rate of exchange .
For most of the world , that prohibition extended during the war , after the war , during the Great Depression , during World War II , up to today .
The United States government forbade American citizens from owning gold , beginning in 1933 and extending to the end of 1974 .
Today , no government is restrained by a gold standard .
No government , no central bank , and no commercial bank is required by law to redeem paper money or bank accounts for gold at a fixed rate of exchange .
This has freed governments and central banks from the limit which the traditional gold standard had imposed on them .
When they inflated the currency , people who understood what was going on would go to their local bank and exchange paper money or bank account entries for gold or silver coins .
They understood that the increased money supply would lead to a rise in prices , and that gold would flow out of the commercial banks and the central bank of the nation in question .
They lined up early to get their gold , so they would not be stiffed by the commercial banking system and the central bank , which they knew would be the case if the central bank continued to inflate the currency .
People who own gold coins are skeptics regarding the fiscal and monetary policies of the government .
There are people who buy gold as a temporary speculation , the same way that they would buy copper , but I am talking about people who buy gold coins and take delivery .
These people are professional skeptics regarding governments and central banks .
They are the sworn enemies of governments and central banks .
The very fact that they would go to a coin store and purchase bullion gold coins testifies to their lack of trust in governments and central banks .
Politicians and central bankers regard such people as enemies of the state .
They will do whatever is possible to impose losses on these people , so that others in the society will not perceive that those who are skeptics about government fiscal policies and central bank monetary policies are making money .
The worst thing that can happen from the point of view of a government or central bank is the people who are completely skeptical about governments and central banks should get rich as a result of the policies of governments and central banks .
The goal of the politicians and central bankers to make certain that the public is anesthetized regarding the disastrous effects of severe monetary inflation on the wealth of individuals .
A rising price of gold sends a signal to those members of society who trust the integrity and good judgment of politicians and central bankers .
The signal says : " Skeptics are making money .
You 're losing money .
Buy gold . "
FROM JOHNSON TO OBAMA
The government of the United States has had a problem with gold - buying skeptics ever since the Vietnam War .
Late in Johnson 's administration , foreign central banks , especially the central bank of France , began cashing in dollars and demanding delivery of gold at $ 35 an ounce .
This led to a gold run on the Treasury , which was in effect a gold run on the Federal Reserve System .
This sent a signal to investors that central banks no longer fully trusted the United States government to be able to meet its contractual obligations to governments and foreign central banks .
Nixon closed the gold window on August 15 , 1971 .
He broke contract with all foreign nations and central banks .
He did exactly what the skeptics had predicted that the government would do : refuse to deliver gold at $ 35 an ounce .
That sent a signal to investors that the Nixon administration was going to require the Federal Reserve System to inflate the currency .
This is exactly what the Nixon administration did .
So did Carter's .
The 1970s were the worst period of price inflation in peacetime American history .
By the end of the decade , January 1980 , gold rose for one day above $ 800 an ounce .
But the central bank under Paul Volcker had reversed policy in October of 1979 .
The Federal Reserve began to tighten money .
This led to the collapse of gold and silver prices in January 1980 , and also to the 1980 recession .
That cost Jimmy Carter his presidency .
There is a legitimate way for central banks to fight gold and inflict losses .
The way to do this is for central banks to stop increasing the money supply .
That is a perfectly legitimate policy .
That is what the traditional gold standard required of central banks .
When central banks followed policies of monetary inflation , and the price of gold rose as a result , the run on gold would begin .
Paul Volcker fought gold investors from 1979 to 1982 .
The Federal Reserve reduced the increase of the money supply .
This was what the traditional gold standard always did .
It forced central banks to stop inflating .
If they did not stop inflating , there would be a run on the supply of gold by a small minority of investors .
They would bring in IOUs to gold and take their gold home .
Central bankers do not want to fight gold investors in this way .
They want to continue to expand the money supply but not face the consequences in the arena of public opinion .
They seek ways to force down the price of gold because the price of gold is an indicator of central bank monetary policy .
Central bankers today have a number of anti-gold investor policies .
ANTI - GOLD INVESTOR POLICIES
The most common policy is to lease gold to a specialized group of insiders known as bullion banks .
The central banks call this leasing , but it is operationally a form of gold sales .
The central bank leases gold at well under 1 % per annum to bullion banks .
Bullion banks then sell the gold into the private market , take the money , and invest it in government bonds or other investments that pay far more than 1 % per year .
That gold is gone .
To get the gold back , the central banks would have to demand payment in gold by the bullion banks .
The bullion banks could not repay this gold without going into the gold market and purchasing it .
This would drive up the price of gold .
It would bankrupt the bullion banks .
So , central banks do not require the bullion banks to repay the gold which the bullion banks borrowed from the central banks .
The central banks simply roll the loans over , year after year , and the bullion banks invest the money that they get from selling the gold .
These central bank sales are not recorded as sales by the central banks .
The public remains oblivious .
The central banks maintain the fiction that they still own the gold .
They report their holdings of gold as not having changed .
But , from an economic standpoint , the gold is gone , and there is no possibility of central banks will ever get it back from the bullion banks .
Another way that central banks and governments battle investors in gold is to announce , from time to time , that the central bank is contemplating the sale of gold .
This scares some gold investors , who sell their gold .
Of course , other investors who know the name of the game buy the gold .
By threatening to sell gold , central banks are attempting to push down the price of gold .
The latest example of this came at the G20 meeting on April 2 .
An announcement was made that the International Monetary Fund will make available special drawing rights ( SDRs ) , which will serve as money for central banks .
To raise some of this money , the IMF will sell some of its gold .
That was the official announcement .
The IMF has been threatening to sell gold for several years .
To do this takes a majority vote of the member nations of the IMF .
It is clear that the member nations are willing to allow the IMF to do this .
Previously , this was not clear .
The figure quoted by the press regarding the amount of gold be sold is 400 tonnes .
World production of gold each year is in the range of 2500 tonnes .
It is unlikely that the IMF will sell all of this gold at the same time .
It is likely that these sales will be stretched out over at least a two - year period .
So , the sales are likely to increase the supply of available gold by perhaps 8 % for two years .
In a time when central banks are increasing the monetary base by 100 % per annum or more , this increase in the supply of gold available for purchase is not substantial .
There is another issue to consider .
It is likely that most of this gold will be purchased by other central banks .
If this should turn out to be the case , then the actual supply of gold coming into the public domain will not change .
Nevertheless , the announcement was made that these sales will take place .
This put downward pressure on the price of gold .
Why would a central bank or the IMF say in advance that it planned to sell a large portion of its gold holdings ?
When a large holder of commodities is going to sell the commodity into the open market , he does not announce this in advance .
His goal is to maximize the amount of money he gains by the sale of the asset .
If he warns the world in advance how much he plans to sell and over which time period , this will depress the price if the sale constitutes a significant quantity .
It is economically irrational for a seller of commodity to say in advance how much she plans to sell .
I say " economically irrational " on the assumption that the goal is to make a profit .
But if the goal is not to make a profit , but rather to inflict economic harm on people who hold a particular commodity as an investment , the announcement makes eminently good sense .
The fact that the IMF sale was announced by the IMF for years preceding the G20 meeting , and the fact that it was announced at the G20 meeting , indicate the degree of the hostility of the IMF and the central bankers to people who invest in gold .
They were willing to take a loss in terms of the amount of money they could have obtained for the gold by quiet , unannounced sales .
They are willing to take this loss because they believe that it is more important to create uncertainty in the gold market than it is to maximize the amount of fiat money gained by the sale of gold .
So committed are these people to inflicting financial losses on gold investors that they are willing to suffer hundreds of millions of dollars of losses .
After all , it 's not their money .
The classic example of this was Gordon Brown 's decision in the late 1990s to sell half of the gold reserves held by the Bank of England in trust for Great Britain .
In terms of today 's price of gold , his decision cost the government something in the range of $ 10 billion .
He drove down the price of gold to a little under $ 260 an ounce in 2001 .
He inflicted damage on a tiny minority of investors in gold , and he inflicted enormous damage on economic reserves of his country .
He did this as Chancellor of the Exchequer .
Today , he is the Prime Minister .
He is now pressuring the Bank of England to inflate at unprecedented rates in order to save the banking system .
Any suggestion that Gordon Brown understands economics is laughable .
Any suggestion that Gordon Brown is envious against investors in gold seems to be substantiated by his public career .
He is representative of virtually every national politician and every central banker .
He hates the fact that investors in gold can drive up the price of gold , thereby embarrassing the government and the central bank .
The rising price of gold warns the general public that the government 's tax policies and the central bank 's monetary policies cannot be trusted .
Worse , a rising price of gold transmits the availability of a profit opportunity : get rid of fiat money and purchase gold .
Politicians and central bankers are frantic today to keep the general public from being aware of the enormous increase this taken place in the monetary base of every Western industrial nation .
They do not want the public to perceive that the central banks are in panic mode because of the disaster has taken place in commercial bank balance sheets .
Large commercial banks around the Western world are bordering on bankruptcy .
Central banks and governments are intervening frantically to keep the banks ' doors open , in order to keep the public confused about the implications of the worldwide economic recession that has come as a result of worldwide monetary expansion by central banks from the year 2000 until 2004 .
PRICES CONVEY INFORMATION
Prices convey information about economic conditions .
The price of gold conveys information about the likelihood of future price inflation .
This information governments and central banks want to distort .
They do this by manipulating the price of gold through leases that are actually sales and sales that are announced in advance .
When an individual invests in gold , he is making a statement .
He is saying that he does not trust the powers that be .
The powers that be deeply resent this .
So , an individual who actively takes steps to increase the price of gold , which he does by buying it , should be aware in advance that he and people like him will be the targets of deception , envy , and ridicule .
Buying gold is not the same as buying other commodities .
Other commodities are not perceived as touchstones of central bank monetary policy .
The price of gold is , even though most of the gold in private hands winds up as jewelry to be used in dowries in India .
Far more than central banks , Indian fathers set the price of gold .
At the margin , however , central banks do affect the price of gold .
With the rising productivity of India , the gold market has received a long - term increase in demand .
This can be offset by the worldwide recession , which is now in progress .
When Indian fathers decide that times are getting better , they will start buying gold again .
Today 's policies of monetary expansion , which lower real wages and therefore get people back to work , will begin to affect the worldwide labor markets .
This will increase the demand of gold in India .
It is unlikely that a tradition governing marriage that has prevailed for thousands of years is likely to change just because a relatively small fraction of the Indian population has moved into modern urban capitalism .
On the contrary , there is likely to be increased demand for gold , because fathers will be enabled to purchase more gold for their daughters than before because they are making more money than ever before .
This is why the attempt of governments and central banks to lower the price of gold will backfire .
Eventually , governments will run out of gold to sell , and so will the IMF .
They will run out of gold to lease .
While I do not think the politicians will ever catch on to the fact that their nations ' gold is gone , leaving only IOUs for gold written by bullion banks that are on the verge of bankruptcy anyway , I do think that at some point the central banks will stop leasing gold .
They will stop leasing it because they will not have enough to lease to substantially affect the price of gold .
I do not think the central banks will ever demand repayment of their gold by the bullion banks .
The bullion banks would simply declare bankruptcy , and be done with it .
That would publicly expose the central bankers as economic idiots , which happens to be the case , and the idiots do n't want the bad publicity .
So , the gold is gone , and the public will not find out that the gold is gone .
The gold is nevertheless gone .
Gone in the sense of outside of control by central banks .
It is inside the dowries of women in India and a small handful of goldbug investors .
At some point , the number of investors who figure out that they had better buy gold is going to go from less than 1 % of the public to 5 % .
When that happens , the supply of gold will not increase , and the price of gold will skyrocket .
If as many as 10 % of the investing public tries to put 10 % of their assets in gold , I suspect the price of gold would go to $ 10,000 an ounce .
The gold market is so marginal in the overall commodities market that the attempted 10 % of investors to increase their holdings of gold to 10 % of their assets would make today 's holders of gold very rich and very happy .
I think at some point this is going to happen , but I think it is going to happen in a time of price inflation so bad that the purchasing power of the currencies will decline so fast and so far that the fact that you can get rich in fiat money by selling your gold will not persuade you to sell your gold .
CONCLUSION
Who is going to win the gold wars ?
Holders of gold .
The big winners will be Indian wives whose fathers gave them a lot of gold as a dowry .
The rest of us gold bugs will also do well .
The general public will never catch on in time , and by the time that it occurs to even 10 % or 20 % of investors that they better by gold , it will cost them so much to get into the market that they will not make the kinds of profits that today 's gold investors are going to make .
Governments and central banks can continue to fight the gold war by means of gold leasing , outright gold sales , and threats of gold sales , but for as long as they inflate the money supply to obfuscate the price of economic depression , they will be running out of ammunition .
They are in a war in which ordnance is in fixed supply .
They can not go into the gold market and replenish the supply of gold without driving up price of gold .
Central banks are expanding the money supply , which is providing ammunition for those of us who want to fight the gold war by buying more gold .
In contrast , central banks are not expanding their holdings of gold , but rather depleting them , and so they will not be able to fight this fight indefinitely .
They may be able to fight it for as long as the threat of recession hangs over the world economy .
But when the recession ends , or appears to end , as a result of the massive monetary inflation and massive deficits that the governments of the world are running , there will be a new market for gold that is unprecedented in its intensity .
This does not mean that everybody is going to buy gold .
It probably does not mean that even 20 % of investors will buy gold .
All it will take is about 10 % of investors decide to put 10 % of their holdings in gold .
Governments and central banks are going to lose the war on gold because they refuse to fight gold by the one technique that can give them victory : stop printing money .
The joke is getting so overused now it is becoming a cliche in skeptical circles – what happens when a paleontologist fills in a gap in the fossil record ?
They create two gaps , one on each side .
But it is often used because it pithily exposes the intellectual buffoonery of those evolution deniers ( aka creationists ) who deny common descent .
What is a “ gap ; ” how big does it have to be to call into question common decent ; or rather how small do the gaps have to shrink before creationists will accept common descent ?
Perhaps the biggest outright lie in the creationist camp , still frequently parroted , is that there is a lack of transitional fossils in the fossil record .
That is why it is important to showcase to the public the steady stream of beautiful transitional fossils that are being added to our already copious fossil record .
In the most recent issue of Nature , scientist present yet another pesky gap filled in with a transitional fossil , this one an early pinniped – which includes seals , sealions , and walruses .
The fossil is between 20 - 24 million years old and is dubbed Puijila darwini .
Here is the technical description from the Nature article .
The new taxon retains a long tail and the proportions of its fore - and hindlimbs are more similar to those of modern terrestrial carnivores than to modern pinnipeds .
Morphological traits indicative of semi-aquatic adaptation include a forelimb with a prominent deltopectoral ridge on the humerus , a posterodorsally expanded scapula , a pelvis with relatively short ilium , a shortened femur and flattened phalanges , suggestive of webbing .
What this means is that the creature was able to walk on land , was likely a carnivore , but had some early adaptations to the water , such as webbed feat .
Think of an otter ( it was 110 cm long ) with a long tale and the teeth of a dog .
The earliest pinniped fossils come from 20 - 28 million years ago , about the same time as this fossil , and already have fully developed flippers .
This fossil suggests answers to several unknowns – what evolutionary path did pinnipeds take , what are their closest relatives , and where greographically did their evolution take place ?
This fossil suggests they evolved in the fresh waters of the arctic , as opposed to the the northwestern US , where the earliest pinniped fossils were found .
This one fossil does not settle this last question , but does suggest the arctic as a viable alternative .
I can anticipate the standard creationist denial .
They will argue that this fossil cannot be a direct ancestor to pinnipeds because it is as old , and not older , than the earliest pinniped fossils with fully formed flippers .
This is true , as the authors of the Nature article readily state .
Most fossils will not be direct ancestors to living descendants .
This is because evolutionary relationships are bushy – they are not a ladder of linear progression .
A randomly discovered fossil is therefore likely to be on a side branch , not one that lead directly to species that happen to be extant .
The same is true of Archaeopteryx – the transitional species between small theropod dinosaurs and modern birds .
Archaeopteryx is almost certainly not on the main line that led to birds .
But it does show that in the right time and place there were feathered dinosaurs that had half reptilian and half bird - like morphology .
Evolutionary theory also predicted that we would find more – and we have , in spades .
There is now a fairly full assortment of feathered dinosaurs at different stages of evolution from dinosaurs to birds , filling in the gaps on either side of archaeopteryx .
The same was true of Ambulocetus , the walking whale .
This one species is clearly transitional from terrestrial mammals to whales , but was also adapted to it current niche .
It did n’t “ know ” that its clade was evolving toward whalenss , it was just adapted to its current lifestyle .
We can only put it into perspective today – as a transitional species , because we know what some of its ancestors became .
And , as with Archaeopteryx , we have since found numerous other fossils filling in the gaps on either side .
We could also look at Australopithecus robustus .
This was not the first extinct hominid discovered , but let us say this was the only fossil homonid we had .
It is clearly transitional between humans and modern apes , suggesting that we share a common ancestor .
But it is also clearly not a direct ancestor of modern humans .
It sits on an evolutionary branch that exists in the morphological space between humans and chimpanzees , but is not on the branch that leads directly to modern humans .
But in reality we have many homonid fossil species , and we have a pretty good idea of those whose direct ancestors are modern humans .
Creationists rhetoric is often clueless about the nature of speciation .
They argue as if they think that one species turns into another , but ignore the fact that one species can turn into two or more through speciation – separated populations taking different paths .
They are therefore puzzled that ( taking this new fossil for example ) a slightly older fossil can look more like modern pinnipeds than this new fossil .
They ignore the fact that the definition of “ modern ” or “ advanced ” is relative – in this case relative to modern pinnipeds .
When one common ancestor species splits into two , one of which leads to modern pinnipeds and the other does not , the ones on their way to becomming modern pinnipeds will look more like their modern descendants than those on the branch that did not evolve in that direction .
So species on the side branch ( again , “ side ” relative to the line that lead to extant species ) , may retain features that are “ primitive ” in the extant line .
To further clarify this point ( because it is so often confused by creationists ) , evolution predicts that we will find fossils that are morphologically roughly transitional between extant species with a common ancestor and at a time and place in the past where this evolution was taking place .
But it does not predict a strict linear sequence because speciation creates a complex and bushy picture of evolutoinary relationships .
But what has happened , and is happening , in each of the examples I gave and many others , is that as more and more fossil are found they fit nicely into a reasonable tree of relatedness , temporally and morphologically .
Evolution predicts that something like Puijila darwini had to exist , and at about the age that it is .
Creationism does not .
It further predicts that we will find more fossils that flesh out pinniped evolution even further .
Creation “ scientist ” Duane Gish famously quipped in his many debates with scientists that the notion of terrestrial mammals evolving into whales was like a cow taking to the water , a strategy he characterized as an “ utter ” failure .
Nice pun , but intellectually vacuous .
He should have been thinking of otters , not utters .
There are already known many living species with various degrees of adaptation to aquatic life .
Otters and beavers are comfortable on land , but are good swimmers .
Seals and sealions are able to awkwardly shuffle about on land , but are even more adpated to the sea , with flippers instead of feet .
Manatees are similar to walruses , but are one more notch further adapted to the sea and lost their ability to amble out onto land .
And whales are fully adapated to aquatic life .
These creatures do not represent and evolutionary sequence , but they do show a plausible sequence of variable degrees of adaptation to the water .
And we have been finding fossil species that show a similar sequence , with walking whales and now walking seals .
The fossil evidence for common descent is so stunning in its confirmation of evolutionary theory , that I cannot help wonder about the cognitive dissonance it creates in any creationist even modestly familiar with the evidence .
SEATTLE , Feb. 20 ( UPI ) --
Customs inspectors say a Canadian truck driver attempted to enter the United States with 1,746 pounds of marijuana stashed under a load of cattle .
Edwin Roy Fuller of Langley , British Columbia , was arrested Tuesday at the Sumas road crossing , the Seattle Post - Intelligencer reported Thursday .
Fuller was being held pending an appearance in federal court in Seattle .

U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers selected Fuller 's truck for an inspection , officials said .
Once the cattle were out of the truck , agents using an X - ray imaging device found a hidden compartment under the floor of the trailer .
" Officers scraped off the natural byproduct of cows and endured the associated odors to unbolt false panels which concealed hundreds of plastic bags of marijuana beneath , " Customs said in a news release .
Officials said the marijuana , a locally grown variety known as " B.C. Bud , " might have brought in $ 6 million when sold .
CANBERRA ( Reuters ) - Australian police released Friday a shocking x-ray photo showing the skull of a murdered Chinese immigrant shot 34 times in the head and neck with a high - power nail gun .
The body of Chen Liu , 27 , was found by two children last year in marshland in south Sydney , wrapped in a carpet and bound with electrical wire .
Detectives said the weapon used was a standard gas nail gun widely available and used in construction , firing nails up to 85 mm ( 3.3 inches ) long .
“ In 36 years , I ’ve never seen a murder of this nature , ” Homicide Squad Superintendent Geoff Beresford told reporters .
Liu arrived in Australia in 2000 and was reported missing last year .
Now , as an astronomer I have to tell you : do n't stare at the Sun .
That 's because you should let NASA do that for you .
When they do it , they get to see cool stuff like this :
That 's a pretty nifty animation ( direct links to better quality movies : mov , hi res mov , and mpg ) from NASA 's STEREO B spacecraft , currently orbiting the Sun .
It shows Jupiter , with its four big moons easily visible , as it drifts behind the Sun from the spacecraft 's viewpoint .
In the animation you can actually see the motion of the moons as they orbit Jupiter , too .
Plus , as a bonus , a coronal mass ejection can be seen apparently gently streaming away from the Sun .
Do n't be fooled , though : that is a huge blast of energy off the Sun , propelling billions of tons of plasma away from the solar surface at hundreds of thousands of kilometers per hour .
The images in the animation were taken over a 30 hour time span from March 15 - 16 .
STEREO is actually a pair of spacecraft launched in 2006 in opposite directions .
They have different angles on the Sun , providing solar astrophysicists a 3D view of our nearest star .
You might remember the devastating image it took of Comet McNaught in 2007 , and the utterly incredible solar eclipse animation that was so freaking cool I put it in my Top Ten Astronomy Pictures of 2007 , too .
STEREO has an occulting disk , literally a piece of metal that blocks the bright sunlight so that it can see the fainter wispy CMEs and normal solar corona ( the dotted circle represents the size of the disk of the Sun ) .
At the end of the animation you can see Jupiter slip behind the occulter .
At some point this year , Saturn will play this same game , slipping past the Sun as seen by STEREO .
I hope they catch that as well .
I 'm still looking for Top Ten Pictures for this year , too !

The 45 - foot , 45 - ton humpback whale spotted swimming off the Big Island coast tangled in heavy gauge fishing line has been safely disentangled Friday , the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said .
According to NOAA , the whale had at least five wraps of heavy gauge line around the fluke .
The rescue effort was coordinated by the Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale National Marine Sanctuary and the NOAA Fisheries ’ Pacific Islands Regional Office .
The whale was first noticed approximately 45 miles northwest of Hilo late Feb. 13 afternoon .
Due to lack of standby support , the remote location , and stormy weather conditions , no immediate response was possible , NOAA said .
There were no reports of the whale being seen the following day , which West Hawaii Today reported was likely due to stormy conditions .
Federal officials reported seeing the tangled whale , now pulling a red buoy , moving south along the Kona Coast on Sunday .
Responders were able to put a satellite tag on the whale to track it .
A Monday rescue effort was postponed when the whale moved on to an area with strong and treacherous ocean currents .
Between Tuesday and Thursday , the whale traveled clockwise around the Big Island and on was spotted off Maui ’s south shore on Thursday evening .
Friday morning , a response team was assembled at Maalaea Harbor and departed on a rescue vessel .
Just before 8 a.m. , the whale was spotted with another whale .
Rescue officials used an inflatable boat to attach kegging buoys to the trailing line in order to slow the whale down and keep it at the surface so officials can make cuts to the line , NOAA said .
After all the gear was removed from the whale , officials collected tissue samples from the animal to assess its health , NOAA said .
After confirming the whale is free from any grear , the rescue team returned to Maalaea Harbor at 2:30 p.m .
Authorities with the marine sanctuary said entanglements are dangerous for humpbacks , and could result in drowning , starvation , trauma , infections and increased susceptibility to ship strikes .
Protest and direct action could be the only way to tackle soaring carbon emissions , a leading climate scientist has said .
James Hansen , a climate modeller with Nasa , told the Guardian today that corporate lobbying has undermined democratic attempts to curb carbon pollution .
" The democratic process does n't quite seem to be working , " he said .
Speaking on the eve of joining a protest against the headquarters of power firm E.ON in Coventry , Hansen said : " The first action that people should take is to use the democratic process .
What is frustrating people , me included , is that democratic action affects elections but what we get then from political leaders is greenwash .
" The democratic process is supposed to be one person one vote , but it turns out that money is talking louder than the votes .
So , I 'm not surprised that people are getting frustrated .
I think that peaceful demonstration is not out of order , because we 're running out of time . "
Hansen said he was taking part in the Coventry demonstration tomorrow because he wants a worldwide moratorium on new coal power stations .
E.ON wants to build such a station at Kingsnorth in Kent , an application that energy and the climate change minister Ed Miliband recently delayed .
" I think that peaceful actions that attempt to draw society 's attention to the issue are not inappropriate , " Hansen said .
He added that a scientific meeting in Copenhagen last week had made clear the " urgency of the science and the inaction taken by governments " .
Officials will gather in Bonn later this month to continue talks on a new global climate treaty , which campaigners have called to be signed at a UN meeting in Copenhagen in December .
Hansen warned that the new treaty is " guaranteed to fail " to bring down emissions .
Hansen said : " What 's being talked about for Copenhagen is a strenghening of Kyoto [ protocol ] approach , a cap and trade with offsets and escape hatches which will be gauranteed to fail in terms of getting the required rapid reduction in emissions .
They talk about goals which sound impressive , but when you see the actions are such that it will be impossible to reach those goals , then I can understand the informed public getting frustrated . "
He said he was growing " concerned " over the stance taken by the new US adminstration on global warming .
" It 's not clear what their intentions are yet , but if they are going to support cap and trade then unfortunately i think that will be another case of greenwash .
It 's going to take stronger action than that . "
Fail and You When Oracle bought Sun last week , the MySQL community collectively curled its lip into a worried sneer .
Is Oracle going to kill MySQL ?
We 'll have to wait and see .
Oracle 's acquisition of MySQL is n't like a lottery ticket .
There is no chance that MySQL will get significantly better by leveraging some of Oracle 's technology .
MySQL developers and practitioners are worried because the only outcomes of this uncertainty are either neutral or negative .
Is this growth on my pancreas benign ?
We 'll have to wait and see .
Oracle has a clumsy history when it comes to open source .
In October of 2005 , they acquired Innobase , the company that makes the InnoDB storage engine for MySQL .
InnoDB powers any serious installation of MySQL because it supports transactions and generally acts like more of a grown - up than MySQL 's default storage engine , MyISAM .
When Oracle bought Innobase , we heard the same kind of worries .
Does this mean the end for MySQL in enterprise applications ?
It turns out that all of these concerns were unfounded .
Oracle continued to support and develop InnoDB , without dropping the car keys into its pants and telling MySQL that if she wanted to get home , she 's got to fish them out .
They managed to keep InnoDB 's dual - licensing structure :
The product is GPL'ed , but if you want to buy a commercial license for it , you 're more than welcome to .
After Innobase , Oracle bought Sleepycat Software in 2006 .
Sleepycat produces BerkeleyDB , which is the de facto standard for embedded databases .
Berkeley DB was also distributed under this dual license , which made more sense for embedded software than it did for something service - oriented like InnoDB .
Oracle continues to develop and support BerkeleyDB , but uses it as a starting point to up - sell customers on its TimesTen embedded database and Oracle 11g .
Thus far , Oracle 's open source strategy resembles a sixteen year old boy putting his complete mental capacity to work trying to figure out how to get high off of household chemicals .
There 's got to be some magical incantation of Drano , bleach , and kitchen spices that 'll do the trick .
Well , maybe not .
Can we market our way into open source profit ?
Surely if we set a team of graphic designers and ad-men on the task , they can do better than the engineers .
As such , Oracle 's next stab at open source was Unbreakable Linux .
Unbreakable Linux is a distribution that 's 100 per cent binary compatible with Red Hat , except it comes with a heaping helping of Larry Ellison 's honey butter .
From what I can gather , Unbreakable is nothing more than a marketing campaign around a Linux support program , the main selling points of which are :
It 's UNBREAKABLE .
FUCK YEAH LINUX .
You need to buy this bitch right now
Look at this fucking Linux distribution .
This distribution is more awesome than your life will ever be , so kill yourself right now , but not before buying some of this shit so that you can be remembered as a hero
This fucker will never break down but if it does we 'll come over to your house and fix that shit right away .
We got your ass , bro
They tried , but did n't really make a dent in Red Hat 's bottom line
So , considering Oracle 's open source track record , what 's going to happen to MySQL ?

Guess what I do n't want ?
Babies .
I never have and I never will .
Please do n't tell me I 'll change my mind .
It 's patronising , and how the hell do you know anyway ?
I denounced motherhood when I was young .
Seven or so .
My earliest thought on the matter was my earliest thought on babies altogether and it went : is n't it all a bit - vulgar ?
It has become more and more pronounced as I 've got older .
All the stuff that was supposed to make me reconsider has happened to me ; and I have n't .
Advanced age ( I am 37 ) , falling in love , peer pressure from breeding friends ...
So , no , I do n't want babies .
Why do n't I want babies ?
I 'll ignore for a moment the insolence of the question .
I 'll ignore the fact that nobody ever asks a woman who wants kids why she wants kids ; no one ever tells a woman who expresses a deep - rooted compulsion to procreate that she 'll change her mind .
Instead , I 'll say : for lots of reasons .
It 's not that I am a power - crazed career bitch .
I mean - I am ; but that 's unrelated .
I did n't want babies long before that madness kicked in - the no-baby policy has facilitated it , but has n't compounded it .
And it 's not that I do n't like babies .
I am ambivalent towards them .
I am like your average bloke in that I do n't especially want to cuddle or touch or smell them , though I 'll do it out of politeness .
( Well , maybe not the smelling .
And , I have to say I find those women who throw themselves at any baby , whether or not they know it or its parents , perplexing .
It 's unseemly , is n't it ?
Like throwing yourself at a man ? )
I adore my goddaughter , but I can take or leave all other small people .
I really do n't like what parenthood does to grown - ups .
This latest generation of parents - oh , it 's odd , is n't it ?
I like the ones I know .
Mostly .
They 're OK , because they 're my friends - I chose them , they are by definition better than those parents I do n't know .
( Even if they are n't - I know for a fact that they were better , once , back before they had children , and I reckon they 'll resume something approaching normal service once the buggers have gone to school .
Wo n't they ? )
But modern parents en masse ?
That pampering cult of Bugaboo - wielding , Mumsnet - bothering dullness ?
Spare me .
Spare me the one - track conversations .
Spare me the self - righteousness , the sense of entitlement ( you , with the toddler - on - wheels : astonishing news just in !
You do n't have pavement priority over the rest of the world ! ) .
Spare me the pretensions of martyrdom and selflessness .
( It 's my experience that parenthood does n't make anyone less selfish .
Humans simply extend the sphere of their selfishness when they have kids , so that it embraces the kids and dishes out a fierce battering to the rest of the world .
Also - no one has a baby out of selflessness .
You really want to be selfless ?
Adopt , lover . )
And please spare me the pitying glances ( I promise I do n't want what you have .
Honestly , I find it mind - boggling that you do n't want what I have .
Are you quite sure you 're not poleaxed with jealousy ? ) .
While I always offer pregnant women my seat on the Tube , on my darkest days I also find myself thinking : let 's get something straight here .
Your condition is self - inflicted , you made the choice to get knocked up , and you presumably knew it'd leave you incapacitated in this way .
I do n't know if you deserve my seat any more than you would if you were incapacitated by a banging hangover , say , or a great deal of shopping .
So part of the reason I do n't want babies is because I do n't want to transform into one of them .
There are quite enough of them out there , already .
There are other reasons .
I like my lifestyle , my career , my body , my capacity to run off to New York at short notice if the opportunity arises .
I like that my money is my own to squander .
I like that my weekends can be slept away , or drunk away , or read away ; that I am not sleep deprived , or if I am , I can remedy that easily .
I like how last - minute my time is , how disorganised , how guilt - free .
I really , really like how certain I am about this .
It 's probably the only thing I never fret over .
I never wonder if I 'm making the right decision in remaining childless .
And you know what ?
Screw the rational arguments , the truth of why I do n't want babies - the only thing I ever really need to say is this : because I do n't .
Mine is not an easy position to maintain .
Partly because our society wo n't have it .
Partly because our popular culture denies it .
The great big emotional drama of my entire generation - infertility and all its attendant horrors , IVF , endless tests , artificial hormones , the prospect of a childless future - does not touch me .
Everyone I know is caught up in this nightmare in some way .
I am miserable for my friends with fertility issues , of course , for my friends who desperately want families .
They 're so , so sad about it .
At the same time , I do have to stop myself going : " Seriously ? " every time they cry on my shoulder .
As for me , I have to constantly deal with the suggestion that I am wrong , or abnormal , or damaged because I do not want the very thing that everyone else wants so desperately .
How perverse of me .
How contrary .
How ( someone actually said this to me recently ) not normal .
It does n't help that fertility is the great cultural preoccupation of the day .
While TV and film scriptwriters and commercial novelists have given up
flogging the idea that marriage and monogamy will save us , they now seem extremely attached to the idea that motherhood will save us .
Even the cool films perpetuate this new romantic ideal : Juno , Knocked Up , Baby Mama ...
Today 's rom coms end on maternity wards ; five years ago they ended at the right end of a church aisle .
The iconography of happy endings is no longer flouncy white dresses and engagement rings - it 's blue lines on pregnancy test kits and outward - bulging tummies .
In this world my not wanting babies is shorthand for my not wanting to be happy .
How perverse of me .
How contrary .
Et cetera .
Am I going to have a ghastly awakening 10 years down the line ?
Am I going to get bludgeoned over the head by the realisation that my life is empty , meaningless and loveless and I 'm staring into the crevasse of a lonely old age ?
Maybe .
And then maybe not .
But you know what ?
I 'm not going to start breeding now , just in case .
No bloody way .
Because - do you know what I do n't want ?
What I really do n't want ?
Babies .
That 's what .
I love industry - shaking announcements .
I love new , game - changing hardware , and I 'm absolutely , almost literally exploding with excitement about the new OnLive gaming concept .
I love that front - end , and I love the way OnLive uses video because video is what my company , Digital Foundry , specialises in , and what I spend a lot of my time experimenting with .
I want this to be brilliant so much that it 's almost painful .
The concept is remarkably simple .
The actual hardware generating the visuals and running the gameplay is n't owned by you .
Instead it 's held somewhere else in the world .
That hardware then encodes its visual output and beams it to you over the internet .
The player sitting at home simply uses an existing PC or Mac ( or ' micro - console ' ) to take the video stream over IP , beaming back control inputs to the server .
The advantages are very straightforward - you do n't need to upgrade your hardware , the people running the servers do .
And that hardware can be state - of - the - art PC kit way in advance of what Xbox 360 or PS3 are capable of , and of course it 's upgradable .
You 'll never need to buy a game again ; you 'll just rent time on the ones you want to play .
You 'll doubtless save money and the publishers will make more of it .
Piracy will be impossible .
There 's only one slight problem .
Realistically , there is no way it can work to the extent suggested , and no way it can provide a gaming experience as good as the one you already have without inherent compromises .
It 's a great idea , and an intriguing demo that is amazing in that it actually works at all .
However , away from the concept and the tech demos running in controlled conditions , OnLive raises so many technical questions and seemingly overcomes so many impossible challenges that it can't possibly work .
In essence , we 're looking at several very specific challenges for OnLive to overcome - challenges that are either massive in scope , or technologically beyond the very best minds of their respective fields .
For this to work , we 're talking about a generational leap in not one , but several fields of technology .
The Hardware Question
To give the kind of performance OnLive is promising ( 720 p at 60 frames - per- second ) realistically its datacenters are going to require the processing equivalent of a high - end dual core PC running a very fast GPU - a 9800 GT minimum , and maybe something a bit meatier depending on whether the 60 fps gameplay claim works out , and which games will actually be running .
That 's for every single connection OnLive is going to be handling .
So , let 's say that Grand Theft Auto V is released via OnLive , and ( conservatively ) one million people want to play it at the same time .
We can talk about Tesla GPUs , server clusters , the whole nine yards , but the bottom line is that the computing and rendering power we 're talking about is mammoth to a degree never seen before in the games business , perhaps anywhere .
There may be a way how this can be handled ( more on that later ) , but even having capacity for ' just ' 5,000 clients running at the same time is a monumental effort and expense .
It would be the equivalent of us running a single Eurogamer server for every reader who connects to the site at the same time .
The expense involved is staggering ( not to mention the heat all this hardware would generate - think of the children ! ) .
The Video Encoding Conundrum
Not only will these datacenters be handling the gameplay , they will also be encoding the video output of the machines in real time and piping it down over IP to you at 1.5MBps ( for SD ) and 5M Bps ( for HD ) .
OnLive says you will be getting 60 fps gameplay .
First of all , bear in mind that YouTube 's encoding farms take a long , long time to produce their current , offline 2M Bps 30 fps HD video .
OnLive is going to be doing it all in real - time via a PC plug - in card , at 5MBps , and with surround sound too .
It sounds brilliant , but there 's one rather annoying fact to consider : the nature of video compression is such that the longer the CPU has to encode the video , the better the job it will do .
Conversely , it 's a matter of fact that the lower the latency , the less efficient it can be .
More than that , OnLive overlord Steve Perlmen has said that the latency introduced by the encoder is 1 ms .
Think about that ; he 's saying that the OnLive encoder runs at 1000 fps .
It 's one of the most astonishing claims I 've ever heard .
It 's like Ford saying that the new Fiesta 's cruising speed is in excess of the speed of sound .
To give some idea of the kind of leap OnLive reckons it is delivering , I consulted one of the world 's leading specialists in high - end video encoding , and his response to OnLive 's claims included such gems as " Bulls * * * " and " Hahahahaha ! " along with a more measured , " I have the feeling that somebody is not telling the entire story here . "
This is a man whose know - how has helped YouTube make the jump to HD , and whose software is used in video compression applications around the world .
He recommended a series of settings and tweaks that would allow for h264 processing at the kind of latencies OnLive has to work with , so here 's a comparison video : source on the left , 5M Bps 60 fps encode on the right .
As is usual with my videos , the action is slowed down to eliminate macro- blocking on playback as much as possible .
Burnout Paradise is the chosen game , which features heavily on OnLive 's front - end demo , and is also a good test for arcade - style video .
It 's not particularly pretty , but with the constrictions OnLive has to live with , this is the sort of performance the current market leader in compression has to offer .
The bottom line here is that OnLive 's ' interactive video compression algorithm ' must be so utterly amazing , and orders of magnitude better than anything ever made , that you wonder why the company is bothering with videogames at all when the potential applications are so much more staggering and immense .

Ditch the dollar ?
Posted
Mar 18 - Currency specialist Avinash Persaud , says the panel will recommend next week that the world should ditch the dollar as its reserve currency in favor of a shared basket of currencies .
Pavement art has grown in popularity over the years and there are few major cities left untouched by the paintbrush of these eccentric artists .
Like buskers , many may be fortunate to earn a few pennies by passing pedestrian traffic and yet remain anonymous and receive few accolades for their incredible talent .
However some street artists are more fortunate and gain international respect and commissions from towns across the globe .
Aside from the traditionalist type pavement paintings where the artist replicates famous works of art , there are also those who very cleverly create optical illusions with their paintbrush .
Take a look at some of these mind boggling three dimensional pavement paintings scattered across the globe .
1. Feeding The Fish
Julian Beever is an established pavement painting artist .
He has been creating 3D masterpieces for over 10 years and his work is going from strength to strength .
In this amazing drawing , Julian has managed to fool the passerby ’s eye into believing that the pond is truly three dimensional .
It looks like the child is really sitting in the middle of a sunken pond , ready to feed the fish that are near the surface .
Even though the drawing is only two dimensional , looking at it from this angle , there is no way you can convince your mind that it is n’t real .
2. Surfing In London
A dynamic duo , Joe Hill and Max Lowry have made the impossible possible , with their pavement painting of a surfer riding the waves in what looks to be a building site .
It is difficult to distinguish what is real and what is n’t when it comes to looking at edges of the painting but be assured that this is a true optical illusion .
The painting is on a flat surface and even though your mind interprets the painting as real , you will not get splashed from the leaping wave , nor will you fall into the depths of the ocean as the water pool suggests .
3. Flash Flood In Canada
Said to be the largest three dimensional street painting ever created , this amazing optical illusion was the brainchild of Edgar Mueller .
Over 280 square meter of pavement was painted by Edgar and a few local artists , and the result is truly spectacular .
Standing at the edge of the enormous waterfall at the end of the painting is sure to make vertigo sufferers feel queasy , whilst those people daring to sit on painted makeshift raft look like they are going to be swept downstream any minute .
4. Jaguars
Imagine you are strolling along to the shopping centre and you nearly fall into a deep , dark pit filled with fierce looking jaguars .
Frightening , right ?
Fortunately this pit is just another brilliant 3D pavement painting by the esteemed international street artist Rod Tryon .
Created as part of his series of pavement paintings at the Walk of Jumeirah Beach Residences in Dubai , this incredible work of art really fools the mind into believing that the jaguars are ready to jump out and attack innocent pedestrians .
5. Stunt City
This collaboration between four extraordinarily talented artists stopped pedestrians in their tracks with this outstanding view of the imagined city .
Edgar Muller , Marion Ruthardt , Gregor Wosik and Manfred Stader created this masterpiece at the Potsdamer Platz in Berlin in just 4 days .
It deceives the observer into believing that they are standing at the top of a skyscraper looking down onto the street below - you can actually feel dizzy as you look down far below into this painted city .
Hero wannabes may even feel compelled to leap over the edge and save the men hanging from the helicopter .
6 . The Crevasse
One of the most outstanding achievements in pavement painting must be this enormous crevasse painted by Edgar Mueller in Dun Laoghaire , Ireland for the Festival of World Culture in 2008 .
At approximately 250 square meters in size , you can only begin to imagine how much printer ink would take to replicate this on paper !
This incredible painting is one of the best examples of optical illusion to date .
You really do feel like you will fall into the abyss if you stand too close to edge .
Perhaps he should have painted danger signs along the perimeter to warn people of the impending danger .
7. Batman
Anyone who loved reading comic books as a child will instantly love this beautifully drawn picture of Batman .
It is another superb anamorphic pavement painting by British pair Joe Hill and Max Lowry .
Bursting out of the pavement , Batman looks positively omnipotent and set to put right the injustices of not only his painted world below , but ours too .
8. Street Scene
This rather pretty picture of a street is another of Ulla Taylor ‘s accomplishments .
Like visiting one of those miniature model city attractions , this perfectly proportioned illustration of a street scene is anamorphic , distorting the viewer ’s perception into believing that they are standing , or sitting , high in the tree tops looking down on the little street .
It makes you feel like a voyeur , spying on the inhabitants but unlike real people , I am sure they do n’t mind .
9. Batman & Robin
This cleverly constructed scene of Batman and Robin scaling the side of a burning building to rescue a real person is another testament to Julian Beever ’s amazing artist talent and ingenuity when it comes to creating visually deceptive pavement paintings .
It really does look like the man is perched on a tiny ledge awaiting rescue while the people on the street below watch in morbid fascination , but in truth the entire scene is drawn on a flat surface and the man is not in any danger at all .
Canadians may have just survived the steepest drop in quarterly economic growth in the post - war period , with mounting evidence pointing to a decline in gross domestic product that could be as high as 9 % , an economist said Wednesday .
There is less than two weeks to go before the first quarter ends , and the early economic indicators have caused many economists to downgrade their economic outlooks for the period .
Wednesday , David Wolf , the Canadian economist at Merrill Lynch , outlined the most bearish forecast yet .
Mr. Wolf said deteriorating conditions have led him to believe that Canada ’s economy will have shrunk by a steep 9.1 % in the first three months of the year .
This compares with his previous forecast for a 6.5 % drop .
The forecast is more than double the contraction predicted by RBC Capital Markets , which has penciled in a 4.4 % decline in GDP in the quarter , and well above other predictions by TD Securities , CIBC World Markets and BMO Capital Markets , which fall closer to a 6 % contraction .
These levels have been gradually lowered in the past couple of months as economists adjust their outlooks in line with recent worse - than - expected declines in employment , manufacturing sales , housing starts and exports .
Given the current forecasts , it is beginning to look increasingly likely that the economic contraction in the first quarter of this year will surpass the drop of 5.9 % in the fourth quarter of 1990 , which was the biggest percentage decline in GDP since modern records began in 1961 .
Mr. Wolf said the downward revision reflected the faster - than - expected deterioration of the economy .
He said there was four specific developments that caused him to take the outlook so low .
There were : the revision in Merrill Lynch ’s 2009 forecasts for a 0.5 % global contraction from 0.4 % growth , and a 3.1 % drop in the U.S. compared with its previous prediction of 2.6 % ; the expectation that the U.S. dollar would buy $ 1.35 Canadian dollars by the end of the year compared with its prior forecast of $ 1.27 ; the extension of Canadian inventory and housing stock overhangs through the fourth quarter of 2008 ; and more - intense - than - expected weakness in core areas of private domestic demand .
“ Our base case does not foresee Canada ’s economy regaining its third quarter 2008 peak until well into 2011 — an extended period of sub - par economic performance despite the ostensible ‘ recovery ’ in 2010 , ” Mr. Wolf said .
BMO indicated Wednesday that there were also downward risks to its outlook for a 6.2 % contraction in the first quarter after wholesale trade plunged 4.2 % in January , its second largest decline ever .
“ Canada ’s outsized dependence on commodities is the economy ’s other major Achilles heel in this environment , ” said Douglas Porter , the deputy chief economist at BMO Capital Markets .
“ In Canadian dollar terms , prices are down more than 25 % from the first half of last year and back to levels prevailing in 2004 .
Not surprisingly , this has delivered a second heavy hit to Canadian exports , with non-auto shipments in January already down almost 20 % from last year ’s average . ”
The debate over whether the economy can recover later this year has sucked in everyone from the Prime Minister , to the International Monetary Fund to former and current Bank of Canada Governors .
Prime Minister Stephen Harper has faced criticism after stating last week that Canadians will face a milder downturn and a quicker recover than most other countries .
Wednesday , Mr. Harper defended his outlook .
“ It ’s not rosy or unrealistic .
It is very realistic , ” Mr. Harper said .
“ But it is not negative and pessimistic and without hope and without policy . ”
Mr. Harper also said Canada ’s economy cannot recover from recession until the United States fixes the problems with its financial system .
While it is easy to install and manage many applications from the Ubuntu Software Center , it is often convenient to be able to handle installation and other operations from the command prompt .
In Ubuntu , app management and installation from the command line are handled by APT ( Advanced Package Tool ) .
Getting a handle on this will allow you to have greater control over the process of installing applications on your machines .
As you get more familiar with Ubuntu APT , you will even be able to manage your installed applications more quickly through the command line than with the included GUI software center .
Note : unless you are logged in with the root account on your system , you will have to use sudo in front of the commands below .

App Installation
There are several different commands associated with installing applications with APT .
Installing a New Package
To install a new package , use the command below :
Install Multiple Packages with One Line of Code
Instead of installing packages one by one , they can also be installed by using the command below :
Package Removal
There are a few options for package removal in APT .
Package removal is more nuanced than simply deleting the files from one folder , and the available commands for supporting package removal support this .
Remove a Package While Leaving Configuration Files Intact
If you want to remove a package from your computer but leave the configuration files intact , you can use the command below .
This method is useful for packages you may reinstall at a later date .
Remove Package Along With Configuration Files
If you want to remove all of the configuration files associated with a package , then use the command below .
This command is useful for packages you do n’t plan on reinstalling and that you would like to see completely cleared from your system .
Remove One Package and Install Another in One Go
It ’s actually quite common to remove one package because another one is more suitable .
Whatever the reason may be , you can remove a package and install a package with one command .
If you want to do this , enter the following :
In this case , you will be removing package1 and installing package2 .
Remove Unneeded Packages
To remove unneeded packages , you can use the command below :
You can combine this with the removal of packages , so all unneeded packages are removed when you are uninstalling a package .

This is not the post I wanted to write .
The post that I wanted to write , that I in fact have mostly written and would have posted days ago if not for this distraction , was about what a great success Golden Gate Ruby Conference was and how proud we are of putting on a top - notch conference that raised the bar in many ways .
But I 'm the person who is responsible for the technical program at the conference , and with the astounding level of distress over the presentation Matt Aimonetti gave at my conference , it 's clear I need to do something .
First off , I want to apologize .
The technical program at GoGaRuCo was my responsibility .
I could have done a better job and prevented this from happening .
Everyone had the best of intentions and there are good reasons why things happened the way they did , but that does n't excuse the lapse .
As a first - time conference organizer there was a lot that I had to learn as I went , and this is definitely an important lesson .
I have n't yet figured out the best way to prevent this from happening again , but I 'm determined to find a way to do better next time .
And to be clear , I do n't think Matt 's talk was appropriate for a professional conference .
If an employee of Google or Apple or Microsoft gave that presentation at a company event , he likely would be fired .
I know that many people found the talk informative , creative and entertaining , and I 'm not arguing against that .
But there were people who found the sexual imagery in the talk objectionable or felt alienated by the atmosphere it created , and that 's not okay .
I think there are ways a talk with that title could have been given that would have worked , but the talk that was delivered did n't .
The most commonly used word to describe people 's negative reactions to Matt 's talk that I 've read in online discussions is " offended " .
From what I know , this is not accurate .
I have n't spoken to any conference attendee who said they were offended by the talk .
I 've heard that people felt insulted , alienated , threatened or unwelcome .
I do n't know if that makes a difference to people 's arguments , but I think it is a distinction that matters .
This all has been particularly frustrating to me because we specifically tried to make GoGaRuCo a conference that would be welcoming to women .
I looked for women speakers for the program to make the conference more women - friendly , and was so pleased to get Jacqui Maher , who gave one of the highest rated talks of the conference .
When we announced Jacqui was speaking , we had several women register right away .
We also made arrangements so that a nursing mother had a private space to use her breast pump .
Leah and I talked about the number of women who registered often , and did our best to talk to women and get them to attend .
And I do n't think doing any of what we did deserves any kind of special credit - I think it should be just part of what you do if you want a quality conference .
3 % attendance by women may seem low ( and it is ) , but compared to most other regional Ruby conferences we were way ahead .
One of the other regional conf organizers said how he wished he could have more than 1 % women at his conference .
But after all that , we end up known as the conf with the sexist pr0n talk .
Sigh .
There 's no way I 'm going to make this go away , defuse the issue , or correct all the wrong assumptions about what really happened and why .
But it might help to know more about how this happened .
I 've mentioned before that we tried an experiment putting together the program .
Half the speakers were invited directly .
I contacted people I knew could give a great talk , and asked them to do one for GoGaRuCo .
Each of those conversations had some back - and - forth about the talk and what I wanted to see at the conference .
There were no proposals for me to read or evaluate , so these conversations were important .
Then there were talks that were selected by attendee voting .
We asked for talk proposals , put the proposals up on a website , and registered attendees voted for the talks they wanted to see .
Matt 's talk was selected by this voting process .
There was some amount of conversation I had with the selected presenters , but not as much as with the invited talks .
After all , I had descriptions of the talks in the proposals so did n't feel I needed to do anything .
I also wanted to respect the results of the voting process .
The whole point was for there to be content accepted that I would n't have necessarily chosen myself .
Matt 's original proposal did not include very much detail about the technical content of the talk .
I worked with him to expand the proposal to include sufficient detail to include it in the set of proposals .
As a sometime editor with some experience with professional detachment , I tried to keep out of the business of telling him what he should be proposing and focused on getting a proposal that would help voters make their choice .
I could have refused to post the proposal , or told Matt to clean up the " pr0n " spin if he wanted to have it included , but I did n't consider that the actual talk would go over the line .
To compound things , Matt has told me that the talks we had over grooming his proposal gave him the impression that I was approving doing a talk that included the porn theme .
I had a long talk with Matt last night about this , and I can see how he would see our conversations as approval of the content of his talk .
That does n't mean I think Matt 's talk was the right talk to give or let him off the hook for what he did , but if nothing else did , this makes my role in the matter clear .
It also shows where I need to do better .
I have been to many conferences , spoken at a few , and been on program committees .
I 've never known any conference to pre-screen presentations or give speakers guidelines about what content is acceptable .
We all assume people know what is appropriate and usually that 's the case .
There have certainly been inappropriate talks given before , and I expect there will continue to be so in the future .
But we make the same decision over and over , to let speakers express themselves in their own way , and to use their creativity and passion to communicate in a way that is engaging .
Usually that gives us good results .
Sometimes it does n't .
I do n't think that censoring presentations or imposing content guidelines would help much , if at all , and I do n't think it would be worth the potential loss of creativity and quality .
It 's certainly worth looking at how to improve things , but there do n't appear to be any easy answers .
People are getting really upset over this , and that 's completely understandable .
There has been a lot of anger and name calling and finger pointing and arguing in general .
I 've gotten angry myself too .
But I think most people are coming at this with good intentions and are representing what they believe in .
Maybe that 's naive , I do n't know .
I do think that this has turned into an important conversation about women in our technical communities , and I have to hope that something good will come of it in the end .
I 'm pretty overwhelmed by this issue and have spent way more time on it than I have to spare right now , but if there 's something you to have to say to me , I want to hear it .
I do n't know how soon I 'll be able to respond , but I 'll do my best .
Update : I realize those without some previous knowledge of the Golden Gate Ruby Conference might not realize that the awesome Leah Silber was co-organizer of the conf with me .
She did most of the heavy lifting on the logistics and stuff , but the technical program was my responsibility .
Just wanted to make sure Leah gets the credit she deserves .
Talk about bringing home the bacon .
At Saturday night 's Bigg Digg party at Stubb's BBQ in Austin , Texas , I ran across two young ladies from the tech world who were sporting brand - new , hot - off - the - grill bacon tattoos .
Lynn LaVallee , a.k.a. @poshy , and her friend Jessica Zollman , a .k.a. @jayzombie , in town for the South by Southwest music and media conference , consummated their roommate - ship early .
The two San Francisco - based women , both Suicide Girls ( that 's the Web 's " enlightened " erotic - photo site ) , are moving in together next month , and they both love bacon .
Hence the decision to get their " bro tatts . "
Bacon is , of course , one of the Web 's silliest memes ( see this short explainer video ) .
LaVallee , 28 and a Web engineer at Outspark , got a piece of cooked , greasy bacon on her bicep ( above ) , whereas Zollman , an intern at Spin Magazine , went more raw with a piece of uncooked bacon on her upper rib area ( below ) .
" We found out we both loved bacon the first time we ever met , " said Zollman .
The tattoos , which they got together on Friday , are " kind of like a roommate bonding thing . "
" It 's kind of like I did n’t want cooked , crispy bacon , " Zollman , 23 , explained .
" I wanted delicious , marble , meaty richness . "
This was her " ninth or 10th " tattoo , she said .
I wondered why she chose such a sensitive area for this bit of meat art ?
" I 've always wanted to do my rib to see how it feels , " she said .
" And to know whether or not I could handle it , because ribs in the tattoo world is supposed to be the most painful area .
It was really rough , but I 'm really glad that I did it . "

HA . Bloomberg is trying to apply FOIA to the Federal Reserve .
Well , to those of you who still believe that the Fed is part of the U.S. Government , pay close attention :
The Board of Governors contends that it ’s separate from its member banks , including the Federal Reserve Bank of New York which runs the lending programs .
Most documents relevant to the Bloomberg suit are at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York , which the Fed contends is n’t subject to FOIA law .
The Board of Governors has 231 pages of documents , which it is denying access to under an exemption under trade secrets .
Via : Bloomberg :
The Federal Reserve Board of Governors receives daily reports on loans to banks and securities firms , the institution said in response to a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit filed by Bloomberg News .
The Fed refused yesterday to disclose the names of the borrowers and the loans , alleging that it would cast “ a stigma ” on recipients of more than $ 1.9 trillion of emergency credit from U.S. taxpayers and the assets the central bank is accepting as collateral .
The bank provides “ select members and staff of the Board of Governors with daily and weekly reports ” on Primary Dealer Credit Facility borrowing , said Susan E. McLaughlin , a senior vice president in the markets group of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in a deposition for the Fed .
The documents “ include the names of the primary dealers that have borrowed from the PDCF , individual loan amounts , composition of securities pledged and rates for specific loans . ”

Moscow signs deal to sell S - 300 air defense systems to Iran
Russia signed a contract with Iran to deliver air defense systems S - 300 ( SA - 10A Grumble ) .
Russia has not made any deliveries of such systems to Iran before , Russian defense officials said .
Moscow signs deal to sell S - 300 air defense systems to Iran
“ In spite of the fact that the contract was signed two years ago there were no shipments of S - 300 systems made to Iran .
However , the contract is being executed step by step , ” an anonymous defense official told RIA Novosti .
The deal is evaluated at hundreds of millions of dollars .
“ The further execution of the contract will greatly depend on the international situation and the decision of the Russian administration , ” the official added .
In 2008 , Russia executed a contract to deliver eight S - 300 battalions to China .
The deal was evaluated at one billion dollars .
The S -300 is a series of Russian long range surface - to - air missile systems produced by the Almaz Scientific Industrial Corporation all based on the initial S - 300P version .
The S -300 system was developed to defend against aircraft and cruise missiles for the Soviet Air Defence Forces .
Subsequent variations were developed to intercept ballistic missiles .
The S -300 system was first deployed by the USSR in 1979 , designed for the air defense of large industrial and administrative facilities , military bases , and control of airspace against enemy strike aircraft .
The S -300 is also capable of destroying ballistic missile targets , and is regarded as one of the most potent anti-aircraft missile systems currently fielded .
Its radars have the ability to simultaneously track up to 100 targets while engaging up to 12 .
S-300 deployment time is five minutes .
The S - 300 PT ( NATO reporting name SA - 10a GRUMBLE ) is the original version of the S - 300 system which became operational in 1978 .
In 1987 over 80 of these sites were active , mainly in the area around Moscow .
This system broke substantial new ground , including the use of a phased array radar and multiple engagements on the same FCS .
Nevertheless , it had some limitations .
It took over 1 hour to set up this semi-mobile system for firing and the hot vertical launch method employed scorched the TEL .
It was originally intended to fit the Track Via Missile guidance system onto this model .
However , the TVM system had problems tracking targets below 500 m .
Rather than accept the limitation , the Soviets decided that the tracking of low altitude targets was a must and decided to use a pure command - guidance system until the TVM head was ready .
This allowed the minimum engagement altitude to be set at 25 m .
Improvements to the S - 300P have resulted in several major subversions for both the internal and the export market .
The S - 300 PT - 1 and S - 300 PT - 1A ( SA - 10b / c ) are incremental upgrades of the original S300 PT system .
They introduce the 5V55KD missile and the cold launch method thereafter employed .
Time to readiness was reduced to 30 minutes ( broadly comparable to Patriot ) and trajectory optimizations allowed the 5V55 KD to reach a range of 75 km .

Court rebuffs feds , reinstates torture suit TORTURE

A federal appeals court rebuffed the Obama administration 's assertion of secrecy Tuesday and reinstated a lawsuit by five men who say a Bay Area subsidiary of Boeing Co. helped the CIA fly them to foreign countries to be tortured .
The ruling by the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco is the first major setback for the new administration 's attempt to use secrecy doctrines to fend off challenges to clandestine activities authorized by President George W. Bush .
President Obama 's Justice Department is also defending a Bush wiretapping program in lawsuits pending in San Francisco .
Tuesday 's ruling involved extraordinary rendition , the practice of abducting suspected terrorists and criminals without any extradition or legal proceedings , and taking them to foreign countries or CIA prisons for interrogation .
The defendant , Jeppesen Dataplan of San Jose , was described in a 2007 Council of Europe report as the CIA 's aviation services provider .
The Bush administration used rendition extensively but maintained it never took a prisoner to another country without obtaining assurances that no torture would be used .
Its legal argument , endorsed by an Obama administration lawyer at a hearing in February , was that any lawsuit by the alleged torture victims could reveal national security secrets , such as government - sanctioned interrogation methods and the CIA 's relationships with contractors .
But the court said the nation 's laws apply to all its programs , including those that involve state secrets .
" According to the government 's theory , the judiciary should effectively cordon off all secret government actions from judicial scrutiny , immunizing the CIA and its partners from the demands and limits of the law , " Judge Michael Hawkins said in the 3 - 0 ruling .
Allowing the government to shield its conduct from court review simply because classified information is involved " would ... perversely encourage the president to classify politically embarrassing information simply to place it beyond the reach of judicial process , " Hawkins said .
He said the government and Jeppesen can take steps to protect national secrets as the case proceeds .
The suit should be dismissed only if secret information is essential for the plaintiffs to prove their case or for the company to defend itself , the court said .
The court did not address the plaintiffs ' claims that they had been kidnapped and tortured , but said judges have an important role to play in reviewing allegations of secret government conduct that violates individual liberties .
" As the founders of this nation knew well , arbitrary imprisonment and torture under any circumstances is a ' gross and notorious ... act of despotism , ' " Hawkins said , citing language from a 2004 Supreme Court decision .
Jeppesen declined to comment , and Justice Department spokeswoman Tracy Schmaler said only that the department was reviewing the ruling .
The company or the government could seek further review from a larger panel of the appeals court or from the U.S. Supreme Court .
If those efforts fail , the case will return to U.S. District Judge James Ware in San Jose to consider whether it should go to trial .
Ware dismissed the case in February 2008 .
An attorney representing the plaintiffs , Ben Wizner of the American Civil Liberties Union , said they will become " the first torture victims to really have their day in court . "
He said the ruling should demolish " the legal fiction , advanced by the Bush administration and continued by the Obama administration , that facts known throughout the world could be deemed secrets in a court of law . "
The plaintiffs are Binyam Mohamed , an Ethiopian - born British resident who was arrested in Pakistan ; Ahmed Agiza , an Egyptian taken prisoner in Sweden , where he was applying for asylum ; Abu Britel , an Italian of Moroccan descent captured in Pakistan ; Bisher al - Rawi , an Iraqi living in Britain who was arrested in Gambia ; and Ahmed Bashmilah , a Yemeni detained during a visit to his ailing mother in Jordan .
All say they were turned over to U.S. authorities , flown to other countries and subjected to brutal interrogations in foreign or CIA prisons .
They say their flights were arranged by Jeppesen , which has denied wrongdoing .
In a court declaration , a company employee quoted a Jeppesen director as telling staff members in 2006 that the company handled the CIA 's " torture flights . "
Agiza is still being held in Egypt and Britel in Morocco .
The others have been released without U.S. charges .
Four leading Democratic members of the U.S. House Judiciary Committee on Friday asked the new attorney general and Homeland Security secretary to investigate civil - rights complaints stemming from Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio 's crackdowns on illegal immigration .
The four lawmakers called on Attorney General Eric Holder and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano to investigate complaints that deputies used skin color as the basis to search for illegal immigrants .
They also asked that a federal agreement allowing the Maricopa County Sheriff 's Office to enforce immigration laws be terminated if any problems can't be fixed .
The lawmakers are the highest - level officials , and the first under the new Obama administration and Democratic - controlled Congress , to make such a request .
They are committee Chairman John Conyers Jr. of Michigan , Zoe Lofgren of California , Jerrold Nadler of New York and Robert Scott of Virginia .
Last year , Phoenix Mayor Phil Gordon , along with civil - liberties and immigrant - advocacy groups , called for similar investigations of Arpaio .
The sheriff on Friday adamantly denied his deputies use racial profiling in arrests of illegal immigrants .
" We 're doing the right thing , " he said .
" If I was worried , with all the allegations , why would I keep doing it ?
I 'm not stupid , having worked for the feds for 30 years . "
The lawmakers ' request , in the form of a letter , comes a few weeks after Napolitano ordered the Department of Homeland Security to conduct a wide - ranging review of immigration enforcement and border security .
That includes a review of the federal program , known as 287 ( g ) , that gives state and local agencies the authority to enforce immigration laws .
In a memo , Napolitano ordered her staff to study the effectiveness of allowing police to arrest illegal immigrants vs. allowing jailers to identify and hold them when they are arrested for crimes .
She also wrote that she wants to see what can be done to speed the process for signing more 287 ( g ) agreements .
Arpaio said this week that he is worried the former Arizona governor will eliminate the provision that allows local police to arrest illegal immigrants .
Legal experts have said Arpaio 's practices were likely to get more scrutiny under the Obama administration .
Holder has a track record of investigating allegations of racial profiling against police departments when he was deputy attorney general under the Clinton administration .
As governor , Napolitano yanked state funding that helped pay for Arpaio 's controversial neighborhood sweeps , which critics said were aimed at arresting illegal immigrants .
In Friday 's letter , Conyers and the other Democrats said that , in recent months , Arpaio had shown " a blatant disregard for the rights of Hispanic residents in the Phoenix area . "
Lofgren is chairwoman of the immigration subcommittee .
Nadler is chairman of the Constitution subcommittee , and Scott is chairman of the crime subcommittee .
The lawmakers wrote that Arpaio had apparently overreached his authority under the federal agreement by ordering deputies to " scour Latino neighborhoods " to search for illegal immigrants on the basis of skin color .
" As a result , members of the Latino community - whether they are U.S. citizens or foreign - born , whether they are legal immigrants or undocumented - feel under siege , " the letter said .
The Democrats said an incident this month in which Arpaio , citing a need to cut costs , " paraded approximately 200 suspected illegal immigrants in shackles to a segregated area of his Tent City county facility " also warranted investigation .
Arpaio denied his policies are discriminatory toward Latinos and called the 287 ( g ) program " a great success . "
" We 've done a great job when you look at all the arrests we 've made and all the ( illegal immigrants ) we 've found who have been booked into the jail , " he said .
Arpaio compared the House members ' request to similar ones made in the past year by Gordon and advocacy groups .
None resulted in a federal investigation .
Vincent Picard , a spokesman for the Phoenix office of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement , said Arpaio has not violated the 287 ( g ) agreement .
The pact prohibits ICE - trained deputies from targeting illegal - immigrant suspects based on race or appearance .
Although allegations of racial profiling are common , not a single firsthand complaint involving ICE - trained officers in Arizona has been filed with the Department of Homeland Security 's Office of Inspector General or any other investigative agency , Picard said .
Some legal immigrants have been detained under the program , he said , but in every case , ICE determined they were n't carrying their green cards as required .
" Arizona 's 287 ( g ) program is working as intended , " Picard said .
Conyers has come under fire from some Democratic lawmakers for pushing too hard for investigations of the Bush administration .
Last year , Conyers threatened to file articles of impeachment against President George W. Bush that alleged constitutional violations of civil liberties .
But he was discouraged by the Democratic Party leadership .
Rep . Trent Franks , a Republican and the only Arizona member of the House Judiciary Committee , was traveling Friday night and could not be reached for comment .
The Justice Department will review the letter , spokeswoman Laura Sweeney said .
Napolitano has asked for a review of the 287 ( g ) program because of questions about how agreements with state and local agencies are administered and if uniform standards are being applied , said Dean Smith , a Homeland Security spokesman .
The review is due next Friday .
Republic reporter JJ Hensley and John Yaukey of Gannett News Service contributed to this article .
The pre-Christian Anglo - Saxon calendar had , like our modern calendar , twelve months .
The year began on our Christmas Eve .
The fourth month in the year was Eostremonath , and the fifth month was called Thrimilci .
The calendar was divided into only two seasons , summer and winter , each containing six months .
The first summer month was Eostremonath , which got its name from the goddess celebrated during the month , Eostre , the goddess after whom Easter is named in English .
The fifth month , our May , was called Thrimilci , which means three milkings .
This was owing to the fact that for the first time in the year , cows could be milked three times .
Most of what we know about Anglo - Saxon calendars and celebration was recorded by the Venerable Bede in the eighth century .
In many Saxon cultures , and it is believed in Anglo - Saxon communities in what is now England , the festival of Walpurgis or Thrimilci was celebrated between the 22nd April and the 1st May .
The festival celebrated started on April 22nd , and days between April 22nd and April 30th revered the wood tree .
On the ninth night , Walpurgisnacht , the God Odin held the runes , grasped them , and died for an instant and all light ended .
At the stroke of midnight , light returned , fires were lit , and the God regained life .
On the 30th April , the dead rule the earth .
It is similar to the festival of All Hallows Eve or Halloween , in modern Christian culture .
The name came from Saint Walpurga , born in about 700 in Devon in England .
In the same way that early Christianity adopted the festivals of Yule and Easter , it appears since Walpurga ’s day was set to combine with the old north , Viking and Saxon feast .
May 1st was then the festival of Thrimilci , a day of festivity , fertility and the forthcoming summer .
In pagan Anglo - Saxon culture , May Day ’s Eve marked the death and rebirth of Odin .
Trees were an important part of the Anglo - Saxon celebration .
This was because during the nine days before Odin ’s discovery of the runes , he was strongly associated with a tree , the world tree Yggdrasil .
We do not know that much about how the Anglo - Saxons celebrated the 1st of May , although it does seem to have involved trees , greenery , and the celebration of forthcoming summer .
MR WILLIAM BENNETT , newly appointed as President Bush 's " drug tsar " , once suggested that the campaign he now heads was a war that America is losing .
He was right .
The lost battles bring personal disaster to many Americans and menace civil peace in some of its big cities .
Moreover , the defeat is a calamity for several poor countries , some virtually in thrall to drug barons .
A United Nations conference last month threw its moral , but otherwise non-existent , weight behind the Americans in their fight against drugs .
Yet even if the weight were there , the solution would still be missing .
The trouble in the present war against drugs is that the main weapon chiefly hurts its wielders .
America 's Prohibition of alcohol failed in 1919 - 33 , while richly rewarding gangs of suppliers .
When Prohibition ended , some of those bootleggers became law - abiding brewers and distillers .
But the lesson of Prohibition enabled those mafiosi who had learnt it to grow much richer : prohibited drugs could yield even bigger profits than prohibited alcohol .
Their cartels now control tax - exempt networks which multiply by thousands the value of simple raw materials , so profitably that they can suborn , intimidate or kill the servants of countries rich and poor .
Drug money helped to destroy Lebanon .
It endangers post - Russian Afghanistan .
The governments of Colombia and of Panama exist in its shadow .
Americans , understandably , care more about crack in their schools and goons on their streets .
Those problems spring from the same polluted well .
The United States is by far the largest market for drugs .
The market is efficient : supply has risen , competition ( the goons ) is intensifying , prices are falling , consumption rising .
Prohibition fails because the reward for evading it is so big .
Seek control , not suppression
Men and ( rather fewer ) women have since the start of recorded time put enemies in their mouths to steal away their brains .
Two main drugs are common in western societies : tobacco and alcohol .
Wise rulers seek to limit the damage , not to ban them .
Governments insist that the makers tell the public how bad for them the stuff is , restrict advertising , increase taxes , regulate sales .
These policies work .
Warned , people are getting wiser , smoking less , drinking more prudently .
Most people who kill themselves with tobacco or booze do so knowing the risks ; many more enjoy these drugs in moderation .
Eighteenth - century Britain was corrupted by cheap bad gin in its new big cities .
The government then started controls on the quality of alcoholic drinks , licensing of outlets and taxation to divert demand to less harmful intoxicants .
British drunkenness has since been a nuisance , not a scourge .
Today 's three main illegal drugs are marijuana , cocaine and heroin .
They are grouped together , and set apart from tobacco and alcohol , not because they are similar but because they are illegal .
This makes them needlessly attractive to the rebellious young , and needlessly frightening to the law - abiding , who should be more scared of the gangsters who run the trade than of the drugs themselves .
Marijuana and its concentrated form , hashish , make you drowsy .
They are intoxicating like alcohol , can damage the lungs like tobacco , and are less addictive than either , as tens of millions of Americans know from experience .
By calling them illegal the United States wastes millions vainly trying to suppress the trade , and forgoes billions in taxes upon a crop that may now be second in value only to wheat .
Cocaine , which makes fools feel clever , has gone downmarket as it gets cheaper and its bad effects on the nose and heart become known .
Like alcohol , it hooks some of those who try it , especially in the cheap - and - nasty adulterated form called crack .
A sensible policy would tax it more stiffly , and restrict its sales outlets more tightly , than its main competitors , just as spirits are controlled and taxed more than beer .
Heroin is much more dangerous .
It delights and obsesses many of those who try it , making them addicts .
Present policy tempts them to pay for their supply either by mugging innocents or by becoming proselytising suppliers themselves .
Heroin 's victims need doctors , but the law puts them in the hands of gangsters ; by calling them criminals it deters them from seeking treatment , so spreads the evil it was meant to contain .
Prohibition cruelly compounds the problems it was meant to solve .
So end it .
Legalise , control , discourage : those are the weapons for Mr Bennett 's war .

This is an idea I had a while ago .
For people who live in rough neighborhoods , on your cellphone , you put it into ' dead - man ' switch mode and it will automatically dial a list of people if released before the cancel button combination ( and maybe a fake " duress " combination where it executes silently ) .
If it has GPS , it could start texting the coordinates to the police or a website that updates your position using google maps .
It might have siren that starts going off as well .
I was told ' dead - man ' switch was a little morbid so it would need a catchier name .
Appearing on this morning ’s Meet the Press , President - elect Barack Obama attempting to clarify his position on Iran , but in many ways sparked more questions than he settled .
Typifying his largely vacuous comments was the declaration that he was going to let Iran decide if “ they want to do this the hard way or the easy way . ”
To that end , Obama proposed “ tough but direct diplomacy , ” hitting out at what he termed “ their development of nuclear weapons ” and declaring “ their threats against Israel are contrary to everything we believe in . ”
Obama left open the possibility of direct talks while adding “ we may have to tighten up those sanctions . ”
The United States has repeatedly hit out at Iran ’s civilian uranium enrichment program , but while officials continue to accuse Iran of developing nuclear weapons , America ’s National Intelligence Estimate concluded that Iran halted any efforts to that end .
In an attempt to convince the Iranian government to abandon the enrichment program , the US has pressed through an ever - increasing number of international sanctions on Iran .
Iran has threatened retaliatory strikes if Israel follows through on its repeated threats to attack .
During the campaign , Obama hit out at President Bush for his unwillingness to hold direct talks with Iran .
Today ’s comments suggest Obama continues to be open to the direct talks , but seems determined to continue the Bush Administration ’s policy of threats and sanctions .
The genre of the kids movie is a lifesaver for parents .
For two hours , the theory runs that you can pop your kids down in front of a film , and it ’ll keep them quiet and entertained for a little while .
Only things do n’t always go to plan .
Because every now and then , parents get unlucky , and stumble across the high profile film that had a veneer of friendliness , but actually would terrify their offspring for decades to come .
Such as the films we ’re about to discuss .
Some ground rules : we ’re looking for fairly major films here – that means we ca n’t include the nonetheless upsetting The Magic Sword ( 1962 ) – and we ’re also looking for films that induce the kind of trauma you could feasible spill out in the psychiatrists ’ chair 20 years later .
E.T. was upsetting , therefore , but it was a straight bat .
The ones in this list ?
They get to you , for a variety of reasons , in different ways .
Some upset , some scare , some really get under your skin .
And , arguably , none of them could be made today .
Before we begin the full top 10 , we have to cheat , and add in a number 11 that – given the kind of site this is – we ’d be remiss to not include .
And then it ’s down to business …
Jen says : " The plastic clone babies wearing naught but mohawks are bad enough , but then they 're also riding carrots .
What do you do with that ?
It looks like some kind of perverted vegetable rodeo , or maybe a bizarre clone military exercise , what with their little plastic fists raised high in identical salutes .
And what kind of occasion calls for a " naked babies riding carrots " decor , anyway ?
No , wait , maybe I do n't want to know "

Ellen Degeneres
Ellen Degeneres has been named the most powerful gay celebrity by an American magazine .
The comedienne , who is married to actress Portia de Rossi , came second to politician Barney Frank but was the top showbiz star on the list .
Actress Jodie Foster and comic Rosie O'Donnell were also honoured in the third annual Top 50 rundown by U.S. publication Out , coming 36th and 42nd respectively .
Milk director Gus Van Sant was 14th , Sex and the City writer Michael Patrick King came 29th , and fashion designers Marc Jacobs and Tom Ford were handed 15th and 38th places in the lineup .
The list is determined by political clout , cultural resonance , individual wealth and current personal profile .
Gus Van sant has found major success in recent months with his biopic picture of Harvely Milk , the first openly gay man to be elected to government .
The movie was a critical hit and Sean Penn went on to scoop his second Best Actor Oscar for his perofrmance .

In an interview with ThinkProgress today at CPAC former US Sen .
Rick Santorum fully embraced Rush Limbaugh ’s idea that conservatives are hoping that Obama fails .
Except Santorum went even further , he said absolutely that conservatives should hope that Obama fails .
Here is the video :

Does this mean that Conservatives are rooting against the success of America ?
Does this make them unpatriotic ?
If these were normal times , under any other political circumstances , this would just be politics , but there is something cruel and cold about rooting for policies to fail while people are losing their jobs and homes .
No one expects , nor should , conservatives be gung - ho for Obama , but to hope for failure , when it would impact millions of people in such a terrible way is disgraceful .
ThinkProgress also has a transcript of the exchange , so it impossible for Santorum or others to claim that he was misquoted .
Too many Republicans still have a zero sum game mindset about politics .
Their idea is to be the party of no , and hope that they can shut down Obama ’s agenda before it ever gets started .
I also find it funny that the CPAC speakers are going out of their way to link George W. Bush and Barack Obama .
They talk about the Bush - Obama spending bill .
It is as if they are disavowing any responsibility for the past 8 years .
It was a great day for the state of Pennsylvania when Bob Casey defeated Rick Santorum , whose was an embarrassment to the state he represented .
I think the key word in that video is hope .
Republicans do n’t have a plan , so they are forced to only sit around and hope that people keep losing their jobs .
They have to hope that more families , which they seem to care so much about in election years , are destroyed by economic distress .
They have to hope for homelessness .
Santorum can hope for these things while the rest of us will hope that the Republicans never return to power .
WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) - Members of Congress are acting as nervous as mice at a cat convention these days .
And for good reason , it seems .
Public anger over the taxpayer rescue of the Wall Street mess is a sword of Damocles hanging over every incumbent from President Obama on down , experts said .
“ Almost 90 % of Americans are bothered by the bailout policy , while nearly half describe themselves as downright angry . ”
A misstep by one party could see them in the minority for a generation in the same way that Republicans were cast out of power by FDR and his policies during the Great Depression .
The depth of voter anger to the bailouts was revealed Monday in new polling data released by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press .
An overwhelming 87 % majority of Americans are bothered by the bailout policy , while 48 % describe themselves as downright angry .
Even more than a third - about 36 % - are angry even though they also think taxpayer assistance to banks is the right idea .
Another worry for politicians is that the stock slide this year has been the steepest since the majority of American households began to hold equities in retirement plans .
In the late 1980s , only 20 % of American households held stock .
But that percentage has jumped to over 70 % because of the advent of 401 ( k ) plans , said pollster Scott Rasmussen .
So the pain is more widely felt .
Congress getting cornered
At the same time they are bashing them , politicians have been pleading for help from policymakers .
Whenever Treasury Secretary Geithner or Fed chief Bernanke are called to Capitol Hill to explain the crisis , there are pleas for clarity and a simple story to tell voters .
A prime example came a few days ago from Senator Max Baucus , the Democratic chairman of the Senate Finance Committee .
" I mean , if you could , is there some way you can just , in English to the average American ... try to think this through and more in words , in terms , that the average American starts to understand , " Baucus pleaded with Geithner .
" When you try to explain it - it 's Greek , " Baucus told him .
Economists are worried that Congress will do nothing more to help the banks .
And this will only make the banking crisis last longer .
Vincent Reinhart , a former Fed official and now banking expert , thinks that politicians should start calling the bailout " ransom . "
" They would have been much better off not calling it a bailout but calling it ransom , " Reinhart said .
" We have to give resources to the financial sector because the financial sector is holding the American economy hostage , " Reinhart said .
" You do n't like paying ransom , but at least you understand why you do it , " Reinhart said .
Reinhart and others believe that Geithner 's recent sketch of a plan to set up a public / private fund to buy toxic assets was motivated chiefly by a desire to avoid asking Congress for more money for banks .
Many believe the government must first purchase the bad assets , primarily mortgage - related assets .
This would require more funds to be appropriated .
Some experts say there will be $ 1 or $ 2 trillion in up - front costs .
Some of that money will be recovered if and when the assets are sold but this is cold - comfort for politicians .
Norm Ornstein , an expert on Congress at the American Enterprise Institute , said it would be a " tough slog " for politicians to explain voting for any tranche of the bailout .
The only argument in favor of the bailout is that it is " unfair and obnoxious but necessary , " Ornstein said .
" That is a crummy answer , " he said .
Opponents will be able to demagogue the issue .
" Congress is uncomfortable - they do n't control their own fate , " Rasmussen agreed .
Both parties in a predicament
Republicans face the risk of getting tarred as the party of hard times , said Scott Keeter of the Pew Center .
But the sand is also running down the hour - glass for Obama and the Democrats , Keeter said .
" If these measures do n't turn the economy around , by some date , people will reject the Democratic party , " Keeter said .
That day of reckoning may come as soon as the end of 2009 , Rasmussen said .
Obama 's political advisers are taking steps to make sure than Obama remains on the side of the angels as a strong opponent for future bonuses for Wall Street fat cats .
That is one reason he has so strongly attacked the AIG bonuses Monday .
One tiny but interesting change detected in Pew poll is that Republicans , traditionally the party of Main Street and Wall Street bankers , are angrier about the bailout than Democrats .
Keeter of the Pew Center said it was an " intriguing finding " but probably not a sign that Republicans are now the party of White Southern non-bankers .
Instead , Keeter said that it shows that " Obama is beginning to own the problem a little more . "

Now that the Bush administration created and Obama administration revised “ rightwing extremism ” DHS document has become a “ political football , ” as Rep. Jane Harman calls it , the government has kicked into damage control mode .
DHS secretary Napolitano addresses the " word - smithing " issue on Fox News .
Homeland Security spokeswoman Amy Kudwa said the report was issued before officials resolved problems raised by the agency ’s civil rights division , CNSNews reports .
It is not the document ’s overall assertion that veterans , anti-abortion activists and pro-Second Amendment advocates are “ rightwing extremists , ” it is rather , according to DHS secretary Janet Napolitano , a “ word - smithing ” problem .
Napolitano points to a footnote in the document that defines “ rightwing extremism ” as “ groups and individuals that are dedicated to a single issue , such as opposition to abortion or immigration . ”
“ If there ’s one part of that report I would rewrite , in the word - smithing , Washington - ese that goes on after the fact , it would be that footnote , ” Napolitano said Thursday on Fox News .
Napolitano earlier put her full support behind the document and its conclusions .
“ Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano on Thursday dismissed criticism of an intelligence assessment by her agency that says some military veterans could be susceptible to extremist recruiters or commit lone acts of violence , ” the Associated Press reports .
She characterized criticism of the document as “ political spinning ” and said the findings have been taken out of context .
Michael " Savage " Weiner on the DHS document and his lawsuit against the government .
Regardless of Napolitano ’s effort to save face , the fact remains the DHS and the FBI have a long history of attempting to demonize and criminalize as “ terrorists ” various groups and individuals opposed to the government and government policies .
The FBI in particular has indoctrinated local law enforcement for decades to the “ threat ” posed by anti-war organizations and more recently with the addition of the DHS patriot groups .
As Infowars pointed out yesterday , the DHS document now under scrutiny was originally produced during the Bush administration , thus demonstrating the process of demonizing and criminalizing groups and individuals opposed to the government is not partisan , as some critics now claim .
It is a consistent policy regardless of who sits in the White House .
On April 16 , radio talk show host Michael “ Savage ” Weiner , who has accused the Obama administration of following a Marxist or communist trajectory , filed suit against Napolitano and the Department of Homeland Security .
The lawsuit claims the DHS “ encourages law enforcement officers throughout the nation to target and report citizens to federal officials as suspicious rightwing extremists and potential terrorists because of their political beliefs . ”
In fact , the DHS and the FBI encourage law enforcement to target all government opponents regardless of ideological persuasion .
[ efoods ] Barbara Anderson of WEBCommentary wonders why Hamas and al - Qaeda are not included in the document .
Hamas and al - Qaeda are government created front organizations designed to hype the threat of terrorism and allow government to attack target populations and grow authoritarian police state programs devised to limit civil liberties at home .
Hamas was a creation of Israel ’s Mossad , a fact documented by Zeev Sternell , historian at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and reported by Richard Sale of United Press International .
As documented by the BBC and dozens of researchers , al - Qaeda is a fabrication and in fact does not exist as a terrorist organization .
London Metropolitan Police Commissioner Ian Blair admitted as much when he said , “ Al Qaeda is not an organization . ”

SAN FRANCISCO 
The first reaction many people have to Twitter is befuddlement .
Why would they want to read short messages about what someone ate for breakfast ?
It ’s a reasonable question .
Twitter unleashes the diarist in its 14 million users , who visited its site 99 million times last month to read posts tapped out with cellphones and computers .
Individually , many of those 140 - character “ tweets ” seem inane .
But taken collectively , the stream of messages can turn Twitter into a surprisingly useful tool for solving problems and providing insights into the digital mood .
By tapping into the world ’s collective brain , researchers of all kinds have found that if they make the effort to dig through the mundane comments , the live conversations offer an early glimpse into public sentiment  and even help them shape it .
Companies like Starbucks ,
Whole Foods and Dell can see what their customers are thinking as they use a product , and the companies can adapt their marketing accordingly .
Last week in Moldova , protesters used Twitter as a rallying tool while outsiders peered at their tweets to help them understand what was happening in that little - known country .
OSLO ( Reuters ) - Jagged mountains the size of the Alps have been found entombed in Antarctica ’s ice , giving new clues about the vast ice sheet that will raise world sea levels if even a fraction of it melts , scientists said on Tuesday .
A view of the remaining part of the Larsen B ice shelf that extends into the northwest part of the Weddell Sea is seen in this handout photo taken on March 4 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Pedro Skvarca / IAA -DNA / Handout
Using radar and gravity sensors , the experts made the first detailed maps of the Gamburtsev subglacial mountains , originally detected by Russian scientists 50 years ago at the heart of the East Antarctic ice sheet .
“ The surprising thing was that not only is this mountain range the size of the Alps , but it looks quite similar to the ( European ) Alps , with high peaks and valleys , ” said Fausto Ferraccioli , a geophysicist at the British Antarctic Survey who took part in the research .
He told Reuters that the mountains would probably have been ground down almost flat if the ice sheet had formed slowly .
But the presence of jagged peaks might mean the ice formed quickly , burying a landscape under up to 4 km ( 2.5 miles ) of ice .
Ferraccioli said the maps were “ the first page of a new book ” of understanding how ice sheets behave , which in turn could help predict how the ice will react to global warming .
Antarctica , bigger than the United States , has been swathed in ice for about 35 million years , and contains enough of it to raise world sea levels by about 57 meters ( 187 feet ) if it ever all melted .
So even a fractional melt would affect coasts around the globe .
“ Unless we have a basic understanding of how ice sheets work , any sort of predictive model wo n’t match reality , ” Ferraccioli said .
The U.N. panel on climate change says that greenhouse gases , mainly emitted by burning fossil fuels , will bring more heatwaves , floods and droughts , and raise sea levels .
The team of experts from Australia , Britain , Canada , China , Germany , Japan and the United States also found water below the ice , using survey aircraft that flew 120,000 km ( 75,000 miles ) .
“ The temperatures at our camps hovered around minus 30 Celsius ( minus 22 Fahrenheit ) , but 3 km ( 2 miles ) beneath us at the bottom of the ice sheet we saw liquid water in the valleys , ” Robin Bell , of the Lamont - Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University , said in a statement .
Many sub -glacial lakes have been found in Antarctica in recent years .
Geologists say that mountain ranges such as the Alps or the Himalayas form in collisions between continents .
The last time Antarctica was exposed to such forces was 500 million years ago .
“ The mystery here is that the Alps are only 50 to 60 million years old , while here we have a mountain range that may perhaps be as old as 500 million years , ” Ferraccioli said .

It 's ready !
The new stable release of the Scala distribution , Scala 2.7.4 final , is now available from our Download Page .
This new version is a maintenance release ; several bugs have been fixed , but at this stage we are only adding new features to the new Scala 2.8 codebase , which should be complete within a few months .
The version 2.7.4 of the Scala IDE for Eclipse , however , introduces many improvements , listed below .
This version will be the last release of the 2.7.x branch , and will also be the last one to support the old version 1.4 of the Java Virtual Machine .
Please read below for further details on what is new in Scala 2.7.4 , and in the new and improved Scala IDE for Eclipse .
The Scala 2.7.4 distribution
What is new ?
The 2.7.4 release of Scala includes several bug fixes , listed below :
Scala Swing is now also included in the JVM 1.4 - compatible version of the distribution .
Please note that Scala 2.7.4 is the last version of Scala to support version 1.4 of the Java Virtual Machine .
Future versions will require Java 5 or newer .
The Scala IDE for Eclipse
The following release notes are by the lead plugin developer , Miles Sabin .
Highlights
This release is based on a new approach to integration with the Eclipse JDT which makes use of Equinox Aspects and the JDT weaving functionality developed in conjunction with Andrew Eisenberg of AJDT .
This allows for much deeper and more robust interoperation between Eclipse 's Scala and Java tooling .
As a result many long standing bugs have been resolved ( see below ) and many additional JDT features will now work correctly with Scala projects .
From 2.7.4 onwards the new name for the plugin is the Scala IDE for Eclipse ( thanks to Ian Skerrett of the Eclipse Foundation for the suggestion ) .
Since 2.7.3
I have taken on the role of lead for the project .
Installation Notes
The recommended installation method is using the Scala IDE for Eclipse update site ; the update site is at :
Note that this is an update site URLs , and is not navigable using a web - browser .
Please see this page for further information .
Currently ( as of April 2009 ) it is difficult ( but not impossible ) to install the Scala IDE into a readonly Eclipse installation .
This is resolved on very recent builds of Eclipse 3.5 ( post M6 ) but for now it 's recommended to install from the RC update site directly into a fresh read - write Eclipse installation .
Instructions for installing into a read - only or otherwise unusually laid out Eclipse can be found in the section " Installing JDT Weaving in a non-default location " of this guide .
If you do n't install into a fresh Eclipse instance , I would recommend uninstalling any previous Scala IDE versions first .
Upgrade Notes
It 's no longer necessary to have per-projects settings for the Java builder ( disabling output folder scrubbing and preventing the copying of . scala files to the output folder ) .
It 's not strictly necessary to remove these settings , but it 's advisable .
This should improve the behaviour of tools which generate Eclipse projects programmatically ( eg. Maven ) .
There have been some minor changes to the way syntax highlight colour preferences are stored ... if things do n't look quite as you 'd expect then I recommend resetting them to their defaults and redo any customization you had previously .
There are persistent issues with dependency management which might show us after upgrading .
If you experience hangs or extremely slow builds then I recommend locating and deleting the . manager folders that you will find at the top level of your Scala project .
I expect this issue to be resolved in 2.8.0 which will make use of a significantly improved dependency management mechanism .
Bugs Fixed
The following bugfixes and enhancements are included in this release :

MUMBAI : Anita Uddaiya , the woman who saw the six terrorists involved in the November 26 terror attacks arrive in the city , claims she was taken to the US and questioned by investigating agencies there .
" I was informed that the ( US ) officers who questioned me about the Mumbai attacks here earlier would take me to America .
They came on Sunday morning and had taken me to America in a flight , " Uddaiya said .
" I had lied to the police when I returned home stating that I went to Satara district as the officers told me not to disclose anything about my visit to America , " Uddaiya said .
Uddaiya went missing on Sunday morning and returned to Mumbai on Wednesday around 1.30 am .
She had claimed that she had seen the terrorists land in a rubber dinghy on the beach at the colony .
But when she asked them where they had come from , she was told to mind her own business .
Giving details , she said on Saturday that around 10.00 pm , the investigating officers were supposed to come to her home .
" Since we were informed about Uddiaya 's America visit , we sat with her throughout the night waiting for the American investigators .
Nobody turned up till morning 5 am .
Uddaiya went to toilet from where she was whisked away by the investigators , " said Madhusudhan Nair , president of Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Nagar slum area where Uddaiya resides .
Uddaiya said four officers were inside the posh vehicle and one of them knew Hindi .
" First , I was taken to St George Hospital to see my husband Rajendra .
I told him that I would return home in a couple of days , " Uddaiya said .
But nothing is worse than when the remake is made by someone who apparently had no clue what the original was even about .
That 's how you get misguided -- and even downright insulting -- remakes like ...
Movie remakes are a win / lose proposition .
On one hand , you 're starting with a movie audiences have already grown to love .
On the other , if you fuck it up , it becomes a horrible embarrassment for everyone involved .
6 Rollerball
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
What the Original Was About :
The 1975 film takes place during 2018 , in a dystopian future where a handful of corporate states form a world government .
The most popular form of entertainment is the titular sport , which boils down to a violent spin - off of roller derbies , with the addition of motorcycles .
In this future , rollerball serves as a substitute for all other sports as well as warfare and , in the words of the film 's antagonist , serves to " show the futility of individual effort . "
In our words , it demonstrates " how fucking awesome sports are if you add motorcycles to the mix . "
The story revolves around Jonathan E. , a star player who becomes a little too famous and powerful for the corporation 's tastes .
After attempts to convince Jonathan to retire fail , the owners begin changing the rules of rollerball in an effort to get Jonathan killed .
As a result , the sport quickly degenerates into senseless and brutal violence .
Brutal motorcycle violence .
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
Death sports aside , the original Rollerball focused more on social commentary .
Jonathan has to fight to maintain his identity and his free will , and he also strove to understand the relationship between corporations and modern society .
The finale of the film shows how rollerball fans have been stunned by the brutality of the violence , but they cheer on Jonathan 's achievements as an individual .
What the Remake Did Instead :
The 2002 remake decided to ditch all that boring social / political stuff and replaced the message of " brutal violence is bad " with " brutal violence kicks ass ! "
Changing the setting from dystopian future to present day , rollerball is just another sport , one that 's mostly popular in the former Soviet Union .
Jonathan is less interested in maintaining his free will than he is in driving fast cars and trying to bang Rebecca Romijn .
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
The new version focuses pretty much exclusively on the sport itself , with the story revolving around Jonathan 's promoter trying to make the game more violent in order to boost ratings .
That 's essentially what the movie does as well , with the film being marketed as an action movie and the attraction largely being the increasingly violent matches .
You know , the ones that the original designed to make us feel uncomfortable and barbaric .
How Did They Do ?
The original was n't a classic , but it received generally good reviews and has established a cult following .
The remake was universally panned and made only $ 26 million dollars from a budget of $ 70 million .
Damn , how could they go wrong with a cast that included Pink and LL Cool J ?
After years of hostility , lawsuits , police raids and heated invective between the two groups , the Pirate Bay has today announced they have settled their differences with US media conglomerate Warner Bros .
The largest BitTorrent tracker has sold out to Hollywood and the two have agreed a deal .
The deal , worth over $ 13 billion ( 10 billion euros ) came about after the recent performance at the Pirate Bay trial gave strong indications that the judgment would go against Warner Bros .
For the Hollywood movie studio , it seems that acquiring The Pirate Bay was the only option left .
In the press release , both groups gave a positive outlook to the deal .
“ The Pirate Bay team has built an exciting and powerful media platform that complements Warner Bros ’s mission to organize the world ’s information and make it universally accessible and useful , ” said Jim Kjeyzer , Chief Executive Officer of Warner Bros . ”
Pirate Bay co-founder Gottfrid Svartholm was similarly forward looking saying “ Our community has played a vital role in changing the way that people consume media , creating a new hip culture .
By joining forces with Warner Bros , we can benefit from its global reach and technology leadership to deliver a more comprehensive entertainment experience for our users and to create new opportunities for our partners . ”
A press conference will be held later today to discuss the finer aspects of the acquisition .
The conference will be broadcasted live on the Internet and details for access to the webcast are included in the press release .
How the Pirate Bay ’s users will deal with this deal is the only wild - card .
Will it be another Exeem , or will it blossom into something powerful and progressive .
Only time will tell .

BRIGHTON , Tenn. , Feb. 17 ( UPI ) --
Authorities in Tennessee said a man was arrested after what was believed to be an ounce of marijuana was found in his baby 's diaper bag at a church .
Deputy Chief Donna Turner of the Tipton County Sheriff 's Department said an off - duty officer worshiping at the Central Baptist Church in Brighton was consulted after nursery workers at the church found a suspicious - looking substance in the diaper bag , The Commercial Appeal newspaper in Memphis reported Tuesday .

Keith Saemenes , the off - duty deputy , identified the substance as about an ounce of marijuana and called investigators to the church .
The baby girl had been taken to church by her grandparents but her father , Brandon Lee Landrum , 25 , was called to give deputies a statement .
Landrum was charged with possession of marijuana with intent to sell .
The Department of Children 's Services put the baby girl temporarily in the custody of her grandparents , The Commercial Appeal said .
Bread Made From Beer
Homemade beer bread
We got this interesting receipt from Zesty cook .
Its homemade bubbly beer bread .
Its pretty simple to make .
No yeast ,
No rising , simply dump in the ingredients – give it a mix and drop it in the pan .
This bread would be ideal to go along with a nice hearty stew or even along side a nice pasta dish .
Ingredients
1 1/2 Cups White Flour
1 1/2 Cups Whole Wheat Flour
4 1/2 Tsp. Baking Powder
1/3 Cup Brown Sugar
1/4 Cup Butter ( Melted )
12 Oz .
Beer ( you can use whatever kind you like )
Method
Preheat oven 375 degrees F. Mix all dry ingredients together .
Add beer and mix thoroughly until dough is still .
Place dough in a lightly greased loaf pan .
Drizzle the melted butter over the top
Bake until golden brown ( approx. 60 minutes ) .
Remove from oven and let rest for 15 minutes .
Thats it , enjoy !
Zesty Tip : Sifting flour for bread recipes is a must .
Most people just scoop the 1 cup measure in the flour canister and level it off .
That compacts the flour and will turn your bread into a “ hard biscuit ” .
If you do not have a sifter , use a spoon to place the flour into the 1 cup measure .
So there it is … possibly the easiest loaf of bread I have ever made .

Do n't Sleep , There Are Snakes : Life and Language
Do n't Sleep , There Are Snakes : Life and Language in the Amazonian Jungle
Daniel L. Everett
Pantheon
The Pirahã are the " Show me ! " tribe of the Brazilian Amazon .
They do n't bother with fiction or tall tales or even oral history .
They have little art .
They do n't have a creation myth and do n't want one .
If they can't see it , hear it , touch it or taste it , they do n't believe in it .
Missionaries have been preaching to the Pirahãs for 200 years and have converted not one .
Everett did not know this when he first visited them in 1977 at age 26 .
A missionary and a linguist , he was sent to learn their language , translate the Bible for them , and ultimately bring them to Christ .
Instead , they brought him to atheism .
" The Pirahãs have shown me that there is dignity and deep satisfaction in facing life and death without the comfort of heaven or the fear of hell and in sailing toward the great abyss with a smile . "
Not that they have escaped religion entirely .
Spirits live everywhere and may even caution or lecture them at times .
But these spirits are visible to the Pirahãs , if not to Everett and his family , who spent 30 years , on and off , living with the tribe .
But they do n't have marriage or funeral ceremonies .
Cohabitation suffices as the wedding announcement and divorce is accomplished just as simply , though there may be more noise involved .
Sexual mores are governed by common sense rather than stricture , which means that single people have sex at will while married people are more circumspect .
People are sometimes buried with their possessions , which are few , and larger people are often buried sitting " because this requires less digging . "
But there is no ritual for each family to follow .
" Perhaps the activity closest to ritual among the Pirahãs is their dancing .
Dances bring the village together .
They are often marked by promiscuity , fun , laughing , and merriment by the entire village .
There are no musical instruments involved , only singing , clapping , and stomping of feet . "
Everett 's language studies began without benefit of dictionary or primer .
None of the Pirahãs spoke any English or more than the most rudimentary Portuguese .
( Among their many eccentricities is their total lack of interest in any facet of any other culture including tools or language — not that they wo n't use tools , like canoes , they just wo n't make them or absorb them into their culture . )
Amazingly , " Pirah ã is not known to be related to any other living human language . "
At first it seems rather deprived .
There are only 11 phonemes ( speech sounds ) .
There are no numbers , no words for colors .
No words for please , thank you or sorry .
There are , however , tones , whistles and clicks .
And the language comes in three forms — regular plus Humming speech and Yelling speech .
Over the years , Everett comes to the conclusion that the Pirahã language reflects and arises from their culture in its directness , immediacy and simplicity .
Ultimately he defies Noam Chomsky 's theory of Universal Grammar ( Pirahã lacks a basic requirement ) and starts a firestorm in the linguistics field .
Everett alludes mildly to this in the book , but a little Internet browsing will leave readers shocked — shocked ! — at the way linguists talk to one another .
There are plenty of anecdotes involving the reader in Everett 's adventures , hardships , terrors , epiphanies and the pure strangeness of daily life with a people who live in the immediate present and whose most common " good night " is " Do n't sleep , there are snakes . " ( sound sleep is dangerous and , besides , toughening themselves is a strong cultural value — foodless days are also common ) .
Fascinating as both anthropological memoir and linguistic study , Everett 's book will appeal to those interested in very not -North American cultures and in the ways people shape language and it shapes us .
It 's a book that rouses a sense of wonder and gives rise to even more questions than it answers .

The anti-choice boosterism of the Bush era is over , and in response , the anti-choice movement is ramping up the hysteria , harassment , and violence .
Even before Barack Obama was sworn in as Head of State – indeed , as soon a he began winning state primaries – the
U.S. anti-abortion movement realized that the anti-choice boosterism of
the Bush White House was over .
In short order their rhetoric became increasingly shrill .
For example , immediately after Obama ’s election , Douglas Johnson ,
Legislative Director of the National Right to Life Committee , called
him a " hardcore pro-abortion president . "
The American Life League
dubbed him " one of the most radical pro-abortion politicians ever , " and
Father Frank Pavone of Priests for Life warned that Obama will " force
Americans to pay for the killing of innocents . "
Americans United for
Life , the Family Research Council and Operation Save America quickly
joined the chorus .
By January 22 , the 36th anniversary of Roe , the administration ’s
appointment of numerous outspoken pro-choicers to high level positions
provoked fury within the Right .
The prominence of Hillary Clinton , Rahm
Emmanuel , Ellen Moran and Dawn Johnson , a former NARAL staffer , led
Flip Benham of Operation Save America to make a thunderous declaration
from a Charlotte , NC podium : " No more will we peacefully co-exist with
child killing .
We are at war . "
And in many places across the country they are , with clinics seeing an
uptick of violence , harassment and menace .
Since the start of 2009 ,
there has been a fire of unknown origin at a Nebraska clinic and
significant property damage at a St. Paul Planned Parenthood caused by a man who
drove his SUV into the facility ’s entryway .
What ’s more , clinics
across the country are reporting increasingly vulgar taunts : you ’re
leaving baby road kill , among them .
Sex .
Abortion .
Parenthood .

According to the 2008 National Clinic Violence Survey compiled by the
Feminist Majority Foundation [ FMF ] and released in February 2009 , 20
percent of clinics reported severe violence such as blockades ,
invasions and stalking last year–yes , even before Obama took office–up from 18.4 percent in 2005 .
" The anti-abortion extremists lost at the ballot box in November .
They lost four anti-choice ballot initiatives and 21 more
members of Congress are now pro-choice , " says Kathy Spillar , Executive
Vice President of FMF .
" In response , the antis have issued a call for a
return to the streets and there has been intensified activity .
The fear
is always there that some will see this as a call to violence .
This
means we ’re always on guard .
We ’re already seeing that clinics that
have long been tortured are
experiencing escalated activity . "
Hotspots abound : Allentown , PA ; Birmingham , AL ; Bridgeport , CT ; Bryan ,
TX ; Charlotte , NC ; Cherry Hill , NJ ; Fargo , ND ; Jacksonville , Fl ;
Madison , WI ; McAllen , TX ; Philadelphia and Pittsburgh , PA ; and Wichita
KS , to name a smattering .
" We know that political losses provoke anti-abortion extremists to retaliate , so clinics need to increase awareness , " adds
Vicki Saporta , President and CEO of the National Abortion Federation .
Like others in this field , Saporta ca n’t forget the eight medical
workers and escorts who were murdered on Bill Clinton ’s watch , the
heyday of Operation Rescue , the Army of God and The Lambs of Christ , or
the irony of relative calm at abortion clinics during the
administrations of the Presidents Bush .
NAF also understands that law enforcement is key in keeping the peace .
In places where police respond quickly , stopping infractions against
patients and staff –whether through locally passed ordinances or by
invoking the federal FACE
Act , applicable in all 50 states , and
prohibiting the use of force , obstruction , or threats to keep patients
from obtaining , or staff from providing , reproductive health care–the
antis tend to be law abiding , Saporta says .
In places where the police
turn their heads , the antis push the envelope .
Pittsburgh is a case in point .
" Right after the election we saw a small upsurge in anti-abortion activity , " Claire
Keyes , former Director of the Allegheny Reproductive Health Center ,
begins .
" But since the inauguration , things have gotten measurably worse .
There ’s been an increase in
picketing by students from Franciscan University in Ohio .
On Saturdays
there are 60 - plus protesters and there ’s been an increase in screaming
and aggression .
We do n’t have a parking lot so people park on the
street .
The antis have surrounded cars , trapping the women inside , and
in several cases the antis jumped into vehicles and touched or grabbed
at them .
The police were called but so far they do n’t seem to be
responding appropriately . "
Keyes is particularly incensed because a Pittsburgh city law bars
protesters from closing in on patients and mandates a 15 - foot buffer
zone at clinic doors .
But it takes police action to ensure enforcement .
" Past experience tells me that once the police get tougher , the
protesters generally hang back and get more compliant .
They ’re like
little kids who push until they are disciplined , " Keyes adds .
Elizabeth Barnes , Executive Director of the Philadelphia Women’s
Center , admits that she anticipated an upswing in harassment following
Obama ’s win .
" When the pendulum swung in the direction of protecting
women ’s rights , we expected something , " she says .
Her expectations
were met when , on the Saturday following Obama ’s victory , staff arrived
to find that two men-caught on tape but never identified - had sprayed
foam insulation into the facility , delaying its opening for 90 minutes .
This was not a one - shot event ; that same month the clinic was blockaded
and staff have since documented an increase in disruptive hollering , trespassing and overall
annoyance .
" The way the antis are reacting has changed , " Barnes says .
" They ’re taking more liberties , pressing the boundaries of legal , civil
protest . "
Talks with police have led to promises of better law enforcement , but Barnes has yet to see results .
" We ’re not to a point where the FACE law is being followed , " she shrugs .
In addition , 40 Days for Life have taken their road show to countless cities since their founding in 2004 and are pledging
increased activism throughout the U.S. , Canada , Australia and Northern
Ireland beginning in Spring 2009 .
The group purports to offer " prayerful witness to the evil in our midst " and operates outside targeted clinics
24/7 for their six - week protests .
" They do n’t physically bar women from
going in , " says Tammi Kromenaker , Director of the Red River Women ’s
Clinic in Fargo , a facility that has been twice bombarded by 40 Days
activists .
" But they are intimidating .
We continually talk to staff and
patients about safety and never let our guard down . "
Yet despite the never - ending need for vigilance — and the never - ending
fear of an out - of - control anti-abortion presence outside clinic
doors –Kromenaker and other providers are pleased that Obama is in
office .
" I ’m happy that he repealed the Global Gag Rule and am
cautiously optimistic about him , " Kromenaker says .
" Clinics feel like
we can finally breathe a sigh of relief on the national level . "
That said , providers are strategizing about ways to be proactive and
protect and expand women ’s access to reproductive healthcare .
Some are
pushing for the federal Task Force on Violence Against Women’s
Healthcare Organizations — active during the 1990s - to become more involved in stopping illegal activities .
" Eric Holder was in Janet Reno ’s office when FACE passed , " says the
Feminist Majority ’s Kathy Spillar .
" He was there when the Federal
Marshalls were send to clinics after the murders in Pensacola .
Thanks
to the Task Force , clinics have had an ongoing relationship with the
FBI , the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms , and the Department of
Justice and there were good responses in Birmingham , AL and Jackson ,
MS .
In those cities the US Attorneys got injunctions against the antis
due to intense harassment and threats . "
FMF , NAF and other advocates
are heartened by this precedent , and are pushing for a reinvigorated
Task Force to ensure that all levels of law enforcement use the tools
at their disposal to maintain clinic calm - and punish those who violate
the law .
As important as it is for the feds to take a firm stance in support of
Roe , other activists are taking a different tack , creating videos
documenting anti-choice harassment for eventual posting on YouTube and
Facebook .
The project , called BASTA !
ENOUGH !
Stop Sidewalk Bullying at Women ’s Clinics , is the brainchild of the Abortion Care Network .
" When people read
about bullying at clinics , their eyes glaze over .
It ’s old news , " says Pittsburgh ’s Claire Keyes .
" People do n’t realize how dangerous the situation is .
These protesters are so aggressive .
Things can easily escalate because people do n’t want someone screaming in their faces or jumping into their cars .
Putting pictorials and audios on
YouTube and Facebook will show the public what ’s really going on . "
Providers are also paying close attention to state legislation .
Since
they believe that federal laws restricting choice are unlikely under
Obama , they expect state lawmakers who oppose choice to seize the moment .
Already , bills to curtail reproductive options have been introduced in Arizona , Kansas , North Dakota and Tennessee .
Editor 's Note :
We are posting this feature from our September 2006 issue in light of the Obama administration 's renewed focus on how to power the country without overloading the atmosphere with greenhouse gases .
To keep this world tolerable for life as we like it , humanity must complete a marathon of technological change whose finish line lies far over the horizon .
Robert H. Socolow and Stephen W. Pacala of Princeton University have compared the feat to a multigenerational relay race .
They outline a strategy to win the first 50 - year leg by reining back carbon dioxide emissions from a century of unbridled acceleration .
Existing technologies , applied both wisely and promptly , should carry us to this first milestone without trampling the global economy .
That is a sound plan A .
The plan is far from foolproof , however .
It depends on societies ramping up an array of carbon - reducing practices to form seven “ wedges , ” each of which keeps 25 billion tons of carbon in the ground and out of the air .
Any slow starts or early plateaus will pull us off track .
And some scientists worry that stabilizing greenhouse gas emissions will require up to 18 wedges by 2056 , not the seven that Socolow and Pacala forecast in their most widely cited model .
It is a mistake to assume that carbon releases will rise more slowly than will economic output and energy use , argues Martin I. Hoffert , a physicist at New York University .
As oil and gas prices rise , he notes , the energy industry is “ recarbonizing ” by turning back to coal .
“ About 850 coal - fired power plants are slated to be built by the U.S. , China and India — none of which signed the Kyoto Protocol , ” Hoffert says .
“ By 2012 the emissions of those plants will overwhelm Kyoto reductions by a factor of five . ”
Even if plan
A works and the teenagers of today complete the first leg of the relay by the time they retire , the race will be but half won .
The baton will then pass in 2056 to a new generation for the next and possibly harder part of the marathon : cutting the rate of CO2 emissions in half by 2106 .
Sooner or later the world is thus going to need a plan B : one or more fundamentally new technologies that together can supply 10 to 30 terawatts without belching a single ton of carbon dioxide .
Energy buffs have been kicking around many such wild ideas since the 1960s .
It is time to get serious about them .
“ If we do n’t start now building the infrastructure for a revolutionary change in the energy system , ” Hoffert warns , “ we ’ll never be able to do it in time . ”
But what to build ?
The survey that follows sizes up some of the most promising options , as well as a couple that are popular yet implausible .
None of them is a sure thing .
But from one of these ideas might emerge a new engine of human civilization .
* Reality factors represent estimated technical feasibility from 1 ( implausible ) to 5 ( ready for market )
1. Nuclear Fusion -- Reality Factor : 3 *
Starry - eyed physicists point to the promise of unlimited fuel and minimal waste .
But politicians blanch at fusion ’s price tag and worry about getting burned
Fusion reactors — which make nuclear power by joining atoms rather than splitting them — top almost everyone ’s list of ultimate energy technologies for humanity .
By harnessing the same strong thermonuclear force that fires the sun , a fusion plant could extract a gigawatt of electricity from just a few kilograms of fuel a day .
Its hydrogen - isotope fuel would come from seawater and lithium , a common metal .
The reactor would produce no greenhouse gases and relatively small amounts of low - level radioactive waste , which would become harmless within a century .
“ Even if the plant were flattened [ by an accident or attack ] , the radiation level one kilometer outside the fence would be so small that evacuation would not be necessary , ” says Farrokh Najmabadi , a fusion expert who directs the Center for Energy Research at the University of California , San Diego .
The question is whether fusion can make a large contribution to the 21st century or is a 22nd - century solution .
“ A decade ago some scientists questioned whether fusion was possible , even in the lab , ” says David E. Baldwin , who as head of the energy group at General Atomics oversees the largest fusion reactor in the U.S. , the DIII - D .
But the past 20 years have seen dramatic improvements in tokamaks , machines that use giant electromagnetic coils to confine the ionized fuel within a doughnut - shaped chamber as it heats the plasma to more than 100 million degrees Celsius .
“ We now know that fusion will work , ” Baldwin says .
“ The question is whether it is economically practical ” — and if so , how quickly fusion could move from its current experimental form into large - scale commercial reactors .
“ Even with a crash program , ” he says , “ I think we would need 25 to 30 years ” to develop such a design .
So far political leaders have chosen to push fusion along much more slowly .
Nearly 20 years after it was first proposed , the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor ( ITER ) is only now nearing final approval .
If construction begins on schedule next year , the $ 10 - billion reactor should begin operation in southeastern France in 2016 .
Meanwhile an intermediate generation of tokamaks now nearing completion in India , China and Korea will test whether coils made of superconducting materials can swirl the burning plasma within its magnetic bottle for minutes at a time .
Current reactors manage a few dozen seconds at best before their power supplies give out .
ITER aims for three principal goals .
First it must demonstrate that a large tokamak can control the fusion of the hydrogen isotopes deuterium and tritium into helium long enough to generate 10 times the energy it consumes .
A secondary aim is to test ways to use the high - speed neutrons created by the reaction to breed tritium fuel — for example , by shooting them into a surrounding blanket of lithium .
The third goal is to integrate the wide range of technologies needed for a commercial fusion plant .
If ITER succeeds , it will not add a single watt to the grid .
But it will carry fusion past a milestone that nuclear fission energy reached in 1942 , when Enrico Fermi oversaw the first self - sustaining nuclear chain reaction .
Fission reactors were powering submarines 11 years later .
Fusion is an incomparably harder problem , however , and some veterans in the field predict that 20 to 30 years of experiments with ITER will be needed to refine designs for a production plant .
Najmabadi is more optimistic .
He leads a working group that has already produced three rough designs for commercial fusion reactors .
The latest , called ARIES - AT , would have a more compact footprint — and thus a lower capital cost — than ITER .
The ARIES - AT machine would produce 1,000 megawatts at a price of roughly five cents per kilowatt - hour , competitive with today ’s oil - and gas - fired plants .
If work on a commercial plant began in parallel with ITER , rather than decades after it goes online , fusion might be ready to scale up for production by midcentury , Najmabadi argues .
Fusion would be even more cost - competitive , Hoffert suggests , if the fast neutrons produced by tokamaks were used to transmute thorium ( which is relatively abundant ) into uranium ( which may be scarce 50 years hence ) to use as fuel in nuclear fission plants .
“ Fusion advocates do n’t want to sully its clean image , ” Hoffert observes , “ but fusion - fission hybrids may be the way to go . ”
2. High - Altitude Wind -- Reality Factor : 4 *
The most energetic gales soar far over the tops of today ’s turbines .
New designs would rise higher — perhaps even to the jet stream
Wind is solar energy in motion .
About 0.5 percent of the sunlight entering the atmosphere is transmuted into the kinetic energy of air : a mere 1.7 watts , on average , in the atmospheric column above every square meter of the earth .
Fortunately , that energy is not distributed evenly but concentrated into strong currents .
Unfortunately , the largest , most powerful and most consistent currents are all at high altitude .
Hoffert estimates that roughly two thirds of the total wind energy on this planet resides in the upper troposphere , beyond the reach of today ’s wind farms .
Ken Caldeira of the Carnegie Institution of Washington once calculated how wind power varies with altitude , latitude and season .
The mother lode is the jet stream , about 10,000 meters ( 33,000 feet ) up between 20 and 40 degrees latitude in the Northern Hemisphere .
In the skies over the U.S. , Europe , China and Japan — indeed , many of the countries best prepared to exploit it — wind power surges to 5,000 or even 10,000 watts a square meter .
The jet stream does wander .
But it never stops .
If wind is ever to contribute terawatts to the global energy budget , engineers will have to invent affordable ways to mine the mother lode .
Three high - flying designs are in active development .
Magenn Power in Ottawa , Ontario , plans to begin selling next year a rotating , helium - filled generator that exploits the Magnus effect ( best known for giving loft to spinning golf balls ) to float on a tether up to 122 meters above the ground .
The bus - size device will produce four kilowatts at its ground station and will retail for about $ 10,000 — helium not included .
The company aims to produce higher - flying , 1.6 - megawatt units , each the size of a football field , by 2010 .
“ We looked at balloons ; the drag they produce seemed unmanageable in high winds , ” says Al Grenier of Sky WindPower in Ramona , Calif .
Gre­nier ’s venture is instead pursuing autogiros , which catch the wind with helicopterlike rotors .
Rising to 10,000 meters , the machines could realize 90 percent of their peak capacity .
The inconstancy of surface winds limits ground turbines to about half that .
But the company has struggled to gather the $ 4 million it needs for a 250 - kilowatt prototype .
Still in the conceptual stages is the “ laddermill , ” designed by astronaut Wubbo J. Ockels and his students at the Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands .
Ockels envisions a series of computer - controlled kites connected by a long tether .
The ladder of kites rises and descends , turning a generator on the ground as it yo - yos up and down .
Simulations of the system suggest that a single laddermill reaching to the jet stream could produce up to 50 megawatts of energy .
Until high - altitude machines are fielded , no one can be certain how well they will hold up under turbulence , gusts and lightning strikes .
Steep maintenance costs could be their downfall .
There are regulatory hurdles to clear as well .
Airborne wind farms need less land than their terrestrial counterparts , but their operators must persuade national aviation agencies to restrict aircraft traffic in the vicinity .
There is precedent for this , Grenier points out : the U.S. Air Force has for years flown up to a dozen large tethered aerostats at high altitude above the country ’s southern border .
By the standards of revolutionary technologies , however , high - altitude wind looks relatively straightforward and benign .
3. Sci-Fi Solutions -- Reality Factor : 1 *
Futuristic visions make for great entertainment .
Too bad about the physics
3 - A : Cold Fusion and Bubble Fusion
B. Stanley Pons and Martin Fleischmann spun a tempest in a teacup in 1989 with their claim of room - temperature fusion in a bottle .
The idea drew a coterie of die - hard supporters , but mainstream scientists have roundly rejected that variety of cold fusion .
Theoretically more plausible — but still experimentally contentious — is sonofusion .
In 2002 Rusi Taleyarkhan , a physicist then at Oak Ridge National Laboratory , reported in Science that beaming high - intensity ultrasound and neutrons into a vat of acetone caused microscopic bubbles to form and then implode at hypersonic speeds .
The acetone had been made using deuterium , a neutron - bearing form of hydrogen , and Taleyarkhan ’s group claimed that the extraordinary temperatures and pressures created inside the imploding bubbles forced a few deuterium atoms to fuse with incoming neutrons to form tritium ( hydrogen with two neutrons per atom ) .
Another group at Oak Ridge replicated the experiment but saw no clear signs of fusion .
Taleyarkhan moved to Purdue University and continued reporting success with sonic fusion even as others tried but failed .
Purdue this year investigated allegations that Taleyarkhan had interfered with colleagues whose work seemed to contradict his own .
The results of the inquiry were sealed — and with them another chapter in the disappointing history of cold fusion .
Other researchers hold out hope that different methods might someday turn a new page on sonofusion .
3 - B : Matter - Antimatter Reactors
The storied Enterprise starships fueled their warp drives with a mix of matter and antimatter ; why ca n’t we ?
The combination is undoubtedly powerful : a kilogram of each would , through their mutual annihilation , release about half as much energy as all the gasoline burned in the U.S. last year .
But there are no known natural sources of antimatter , so we would have to synthesize it .
And the most efficient antimatter maker in the world , the particle accelerator at CERN near Geneva , would have to run nonstop for 100 trillion years to make a kilogram of antiprotons .
So even though physicists have ways to capture the odd antiatom [ see “ Making Cold Antimatter , ” by Graham P. Collins ; Scientific American , June 2005 ] , antimatter power plants will never materialize .
4. Space - Based Solar -- Reality Factor : 3 *
With panels in orbit , where the sun shines brightest — and all the time — solar could really take off .
But there ’s a catch
When Peter Glaser proposed in 1968 that city - size satellites could harvest solar power from deep space and beam it back to the earth as invisible microwaves , the idea seemed pretty far out , even given Glaser ’s credentials as president of the International Solar Energy Society .
But after the oil crises of the 1970s sent fuel prices skyrocketing , NASA engineers gave the scheme a long hard look .
The technology seemed feasible until , in 1979 , they estimated the “ cost to first power ” : $ 305 billion ( in 2000 dollars ) .
That was the end of that project .
Solar and space technologies have made great strides since then , however , and space solar power ( SSP ) still has its champions .
Hoffert cites two big advantages that high - flying arrays could lord over their earthbound brethren .
In a geostationary orbit well clear of the earth ’s shadow and atmosphere , the average intensity of sunshine is eight times as strong as it is on the ground .
And with the sun always in their sights , SSP stations could feed a reliable , fixed amount of electricity into the grid .
( A rectifying antenna , or “ rectenna , ” spread over several square kilometers of land could convert microwaves to electric current with about 90 percent efficiency , even when obstructed by clouds . )
“ SSP offers a truly sustainable , global - scale and emission - free electricity source , ” Hoffert argues .
“ It is more cost - effective and more technologically feasible than controlled thermonuclear fusion . ”
Yet there is minimal research funding for space - based solar , he complains , while a $ 10 - billion fusion reactor has just been approved .
NASA did in fact fund small studies from 1995 to 2003 that evaluated a variety of SSP components and architectures .
The designs took advantage of thin - film photovoltaics to create the electricity , high - temperature superconductors to carry it , and infrared lasers ( in place of microwave emitters ) to beam it to ground stations .
Such high - tech innovations enabled SSP engineers to cut the systems ’ weight and thus reduce the formidable cost of launching them into orbit .
But here ’s the catch : the power - to - payload ratio , at a few hundred watts per kilogram , has remained far too low .
Until it rises , space - based solar will never match the price of other renewable energy sources , even accounting for the energy storage systems that ground - based alternatives require to smooth over nighttime and poor - weather lulls .
Technical advances could change the game rapidly , however .
Lighter or more efficient photovoltaic materials are in the works ] .
In May , for example , researchers at the University of Neuchâtel in Switzerland reported a new technique for depositing amorphous silicon cells on a space - hardy film that yields power densities of 3,200 watts per kilogram .
Although that is encouraging , says John C. Mankins , who led NASA ’s SSP program from 1995 to 2003 , “ the devil is in the supporting structure and power management . ”
Mankins sees more promise in advanced earth - to - orbit space transportation systems , now on drawing boards , that might cut launch costs from more than $ 10,000 a kilogram to a few hundred dollars in coming ­decades .
JAXA , the Japanese space agency , last year announced plans to launch by 2010 a satellite that will unfurl a large solar array and beam 100 kilowatts of microwave or laser power to a receiving station on the earth .
The agency ’s long - term road map calls for flying a 250 - megawatt prototype system by 2020 in preparation for a gigawatt - class commercial SSP plant a decade later .
NASA once had similarly grand designs , but the agency largely halted work on SSP when its priorities shifted to space exploration two years ago .
5. Nanotech Solar Cells -- Reality Factor : 4 *
Materials engineered from the atoms up could boost photovoltaic efficiencies from pathetic to profitable
Five gigawatts — a paltry 0.038 percent of the world ’s consumption of energy from all sources .
That , roughly , is the cumulative capacity of all photovoltaic ( PV ) power systems installed in the world , half a century after solar cells were first commercialized .
In the category of greatest unfulfilled potential , solar - electric power is a technology without rival .
Even if orbiting arrays never get off the ground , nanotechnology now looks set to rescue solar from its perennial irrelevance , however .
Engineers are working on a wide range of materials that outshine the bulk silicon used in most PV cells today , improving both their efficiency and their cost .
The most sophisticated ( and expensive ) second - generation silicon cells eke out about 22 percent efficiency .
New materials laced with quantum dots might double that , if discoveries reported this past March pan out as hoped .
The dots , each less than 10 billionths of a meter wide , were created by groups at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Colorado and Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico .
When sunlight hits a silicon cell , most of it ends up as heat .
At best , a photon can knock loose one electron .
Quantum dots can put a wider range of wavelengths to useful work and can kick out as many as seven electrons for every photon .
Most of those electrons soon get stuck again , so engineers are testing better ways to funnel them into wires .
They are also hunting for dot materials that are more environmentally friendly than the lead , selenium and cadmium in today ’s nanocrystals .
Despite their high - tech name , the dots are relatively inexpensive to make .
Nanoparticles of a different kind promise to help solar compete on price .
Near San Francisco , Nanosolar is building a factory that will churn out 200 million cells a year by printing nanoscopic bits of copper - indium - gallium - diselenide onto continuous reels of ultrathin film .
The particles self - assemble into light - harvesting structures .
Nanosolar ’s CEO says he is aiming to bring the cost down to 50 cents a watt .
The buzz has awakened energy giants .
Shell now has a subsidiary making solar cells , and BP in June launched a five - year project with the California Institute of Technology .
Its goal : high - efficiency solar cells made from silicon nanorods .
6. A Global Supergrid -- Reality Factor : 2 *
Revolutionary energy sources need a revolutionary superconducting electrical grid that spans the planet
“ A basic problem with renewable energy sources is matching supply and demand , ” Hoffert observes .
Supplies of sunshine , wind , waves and even biofuel crops fade in and out unpredictably , and they tend to be concentrated where people are not .
One solution is to build long - distance transmission lines from superconducting wires .
When chilled to near absolute zero , these conduits can wheel tremendous currents over vast distances with almost no loss .
In July the BOC Group in New Jersey and its partners began installing 350 meters of superconducting cable into the grid in Albany , N.Y .
The nitrogen - cooled link will carry up to 48 megawatts ’ worth of current at 34,500 volts .
“ We know the technology works ; this project will demonstrate that , ” says Ed Garcia , a vice president at BOC .
At a 2004 workshop , experts sketched out designs for a “ SuperGrid ” that would simultaneously transport electricity and hydrogen .
The hydrogen , condensed to a liquid or ultracold gas , would cool the superconducting wires and could also power fuel cells and combustion engines .
With a transcontinental SuperGrid , solar arrays in Australia and wind farms in Siberia might power lights in the U.S. and air conditioners in Europe .
But building such infrastructure would most likely take generations and trillions of dollars .
7. Waves and Tides -- Reality Factor : 5 *
The surging ocean offers a huge , but virtually untapped , energy resource .
Companies are now gearing up to catch the wave
The tide has clearly turned for the dream of harnessing the incessant motion of the sea .
“ Ocean energy is about 20 years behind wind power , ” acknowledges Roger Bedard , ocean energy leader at the Electric Power Research Institute .
“ But it certainly is n’t going to take 20 years to catch up . ”
Through the 1980s and 1990s , advocates of tidal and wave power could point to only two commercial successes : a 240 - megawatt ( MW ) tidal plant in France and a 20 - MW tidal station in Nova Scotia .
Now China has jumped onboard with a 40 - kilowatt ( kW ) facility in Daishan .
Six 36 - kW turbines are soon to start spinning in New York City ’s East River .
This summer the first commercial wave farm will go online in Portugal .
And investors and governments are hatching much grander schemes .
The grandest is in Britain , where analysts suggest ocean power could eventually supply one fifth of the country ’s electricity and fulfill its obligations under the Kyoto Protocol .
The U.K. government in July ordered a feasibility study for a 16 - kilometer dam across the Severn estuary , whose tides rank second largest in the world .
The Severn barrage , as it is called , would cost $ 25 billion and produce 8.6 gigawatts when tides were flowing .
Proponents claim it would operate for a century or more .
Environmental groups warn that the barrage would wreak havoc on the estuarine ecosystem .
Better than a dam , argues Peter Fraenkel of Marine Current Turbines , would be arrays of the SeaGen turbines his company has developed .
Such tide farms dotting the U.K. coast could generate almost as much electricity as the Severn dam but with less capital investment , power variation and environmental impact .
Fraenkel ’s claims will be put to a small test this year , when a tidal generator the company is installing in Strangford Lough begins contributing an average power of 540 kW to the grid in Northern Ireland .
The machine works much like an underwater windmill , with two rotors sharing a single mast cemented into the seabed .
“ The biggest advantage of tidal power is that it is completely predictable , ” Bedard says .
“ But on a global scale , it will never be very large . ”
There are too few places where tides move fast enough .
Energetic waves are more capricious but also more ubiquitous .
An analysis by Bedard ’s group found that if just 20 percent of the commercially viable offshore wave resources in the U.S. were harnessed with 50 - percent - efficient wave farms , the energy produced would exceed all conventional hydroelectric generation in the country .
Four companies have recently completed sea trials of their wave conversion designs .
One of them , Ocean Power Delivery , will soon begin reaping 2.25 MW off the coast of Portugal from three of its 120 - meter - long Pelamis machines .
If all goes well , it will order another 30 this year .
Surf ’s up .
8. Designer Microbes -- Reality Factor : 4 *
Genetic engineers think they can create synthetic life - forms that will let us grow energy as easily as we do food
“ We view the genome as the software , or even the operating system , of the cell , ” said J. Craig Venter .
It ’s time for an upgrade , he suggested .
Venter was preaching to the choir : a large group of biologists at the Synthetic Biology 2.0 conference this past May .
Many of the scientists there have projects to genetically rewire organisms so extensively that the resulting cells would qualify as synthetic species .
Venter , who gained fame and fortune for the high - speed methods he helped to develop to sequence the human genome , recently founded a company , Synthetic Genomics , to commercialize custom - built cells .
“ We think this field has tremendous potential to replace the petrochemical industry , possibly within a decade , ” he said .
That assessment may be overly optimistic ; no one has yet assembled a single cell from scratch .
But Venter reported rapid progress on his team ’s efforts to create artificial chromosomes that contain just the minimum set of genes required for self - sustaining life within a controlled , nutrient - rich environment .
“ The first synthetic prokaryotic cell [ lacking a nucleus ] will definitely happen within the next two years , ” he predicted .
“ And synthetic eukaryotic genomes [ for cells with nuclei ] will happen within a decade at most . ”
Venter envisions novel microbes that capture carbon dioxide from the smokestack of a power plant and turn it into natural gas for the boiler .
“ There are already thousands , perhaps millions , of organisms on our planet that know how to do this , ” Venter said .
Although none of those species may be suited for life in a power plant , engineers could borrow their genetic circuits for new creations .
“ We also have biological systems under construction that are trying to produce hydrogen directly from sunlight , using photosynthesis , ” he added .
Steven Chu , director of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory , announced that his lab is readying a proposal for a major project to harness the power of the sun and turn it into fuels for transportation .
With the tools of genetic engineering , Chu explained , “ we can work on modifying plants and algaes to make them self - fertilizing and resistant to drought and pests . ”
The novel crops would offer high yields of cellulose , which man -made microbes could then convert to fuels .
Chu expects biological processing to be far more efficient than the energy - intensive processes , such as steam explosion and thermal hydrolysis , currently used to make ethanol .
With oil prices approaching $ 80 a barrel , bioprocessing may not have to wait for life - forms built from scratch .
GreenFuel in Cambridge , Mass. , has installed algae farms at power plants to convert up to 40 percent of the CO2 they spew into raw material for biofuels .
The company claims that a large algae farm next to a 1 - GW plant could yield 50 million gallons a year of ethanol .
“ There are great opportunities here , ” Chu avers .
“ And not only that — it will help save the world . ”

A recent article in The New York Times quotes President Obama as saying , " I do n't buy the argument that providing workers with collective - bargaining rights somehow weakens the economy or worsens the business environment .
If you 've got workers who have decent pay and benefits , they 're also customers for business . "
( March 2 , 2009 , p. B3 . )
The President 's statement reveals a great deal about his understanding or , more correctly , lack of understanding of economics .
Collective bargaining is the joining together , typically through the instrumentality of a labor union , of all workers in a given occupation or industry for the purpose of acting as a single unit in seeking pay and benefits .
It is an attempt to compel employers to deal with just one party — i.e. , the labor union — and to come to terms agreeable to that party or to be unable to obtain labor .
The imposition and maintenance of collective bargaining necessarily depends on compulsion and coercion , i.e. , on the use of physical force against both employers and unemployed workers .
This coercion is necessitated , in substantial measure , precisely by the seeming success that collective bargaining can achieve .
That success is measured in terms of the rise in wage rates that it achieves .
That rise in wage rates is all that labor union leaders and their ignorant supporters are aware of .
Precisely this " success , " however , is the cause of major problems .
The first is that higher wage rates reduce the quantity of labor that any given amount of capital funds can employ .
For example , at a wage of $ 20,000 per year , $ 1 million of payroll funds can employ 50 workers for a year .
But at a wage of $ 25,000 per year , it can employ only 40 workers for a year .
With every further rise in the wage , correspondingly fewer workers are able to be employed .
Higher wage rates also serve to raise costs of production and thus the selling prices of the products that the higher - paid workers are producing .
These higher selling prices reduce the quantities of the products that buyers are able and willing to buy .
And thus , whether as the result of the reduced purchasing power of capital funds in the face of higher wage rates or the reduced quantities of products demanded by customers in the face of higher product prices , the effect of collective bargaining is a reduced quantity of labor employed , i.e. , unemployment .
It is shocking , indeed , frightening , that the President of the United States , whose main concern at the moment is supposedly with overcoming mass unemployment and preventing its getting worse , does not understand that any policy that drives up wage rates drives up unemployment .
The unemployment that collective bargaining causes is what explains why it is necessary to resort to coercion against wage earners in order to maintain the system .
The self - interest of the unemployed is to find work , and to accept lower wage rates as the means of doing so .
And taking advantage of that fact is to the self - interest of employers .
Thus there are two parties , unemployed workers and employers , whose self - interest lies with a reduction in the higher wage rates achieved by collective bargaining .
If these parties are free to act in their self - interest , the system of collective bargaining must break down .
How are they to be prevented from acting in their self - interest ?
The answer is physical force .
Stepping outside the system of collective bargaining must be made illegal if the system is not to break down .
That means employers and unemployed workers must be threatened with fines or imprisonment for acting in their self - interest and withdrawing from the system of collective bargaining .
In the last analysis , they must be threatened with the specter of armed officers ready to cart them off to jail if they disobey the requirements of the system , and to club and shoot them should they physically resist being carted off to jail .
( It is not always necessary that the physical force that imposes and maintains collective bargaining come directly from the government .
It can often come from labor unions that the government chooses not to prosecute when their members physically assault strikebreakers , surround factories and refuse to allow entry or exist , start fires , set off stink bombs , shoot out tires , and perform other acts of vandalism and intimidation . )
In saying , " I do n't buy the argument that providing workers with collective - bargaining rights somehow weakens the economy or worsens the business environment , " President Obama confesses to not knowing that collective bargaining raises prices and causes unemployment .
He confesses to not knowing that it raises costs and prices not only through the imposition of artificially high wage rates , but also in imposing on employers the use of unnecessary labor , sometimes as many as four or five workers to do the job that just one could do .
( A classic example of this is the insistence on the use of a carpenter , plumber , electrician , tile setter , and drywaller to make a simple repair in a bathroom , merely because the separate labor unions involved claim each operation as belonging to their respective members exclusively , i.e. , claim a monopoly on that type of operation . )
He confesses to not knowing how the enormous difficulties that labor unions put in the way of firing incompetent workers are responsible for such phenomena as so - called Monday - morning automobiles .
That is , automobiles poorly made for no other reason than because they happened to be made on a day when too few workers showed up , or too few showed up sober , to do the jobs they were paid to do .
The automobiles companies were unable to fire such workers without precipitating a crippling strike , to which the system of compulsory collective bargaining gave them no alternative .
Collective bargaining , with its imposition of higher costs and prices and lower product quality , is at the root of the destruction of the American automobile industry and many other American industries .
President Obama not only chooses not to know this , but selects union leaders as his companions , including the leader of the United Automobile Workers Union .
( The Times article from which I quoted him is accompanied by a photograph that shows him , in what appears to be a round of golf , with Ron Gettelfinger , who is the president of the U.A.W. , James Hoffa , who is the president of the Teamsters , and John Sweeney , who is the president of the A.F.L. - C.I.O .
The article notes that " Mr. Sweeney has visited the White House at least once a week since Inauguration Day . " )
The reader should keep in mind the coercive nature of collective bargaining .
Then he should consider Mr. Obama 's observation that " If you 've got workers who have decent pay and benefits [ as the alleged result of collective bargaining ] , they 're also customers for business . "
This statement makes about as much sense as declaring that people who are successful at sticking up gas stations are also customers of gas stations .
Moreover , the workers who are unemployed by collective bargaining are not customers of business , or not very good customers ( they ca n't afford to be ) .
And the products offered by business to its customers are poorer and more expensive because of collective bargaining .
This is something , it must be stressed , that reduces the buying power of the wages of workers throughout the economic system , i.e. , reduces what economists call their " real wages . "
Mr. Obama needs to forget the nonsense he believes about collective bargaining and paying extortionate wages somehow benefiting business and learn to understand how it harms wage earners , how it harms every wage earner who must pay more and get less as the result of legally enforced collective bargaining .
He must learn to understand how it also harms every worker who must earn less as the result of being displaced by collective bargaining from the better paying jobs he could have had if wage rates in those lines had not been driven artificially still higher by collective bargaining and thus reduced the number of workers who could be employed in them and thereby forced those workers into lower paying jobs .
He must learn to understand how it also harms every worker who must earn less as the result of being displaced by collective bargaining from the better paying jobs he could have had if wage rates in those lines had not been driven artificially still higher by collective bargaining and thus reduced the number of workers who could be employed in them and thereby forced those workers into lower paying jobs .
Unfortunately , it does not seem very likely that Mr. Obama will ever learn any of this .
He appears to be so charmed by the use of compulsion and coercion that he and his supporters in Congress are ready to unleash a reign of outright mass intimidation against American workers .
In a bow to Orwell 's 1984 and its world filled with such slogans as " war is peace , " " freedom is slavery , " and " love is hate , " Obama and his henchmen are readying " the Employee Free Choice Act . "
This is an act designed precisely to end employee free choice , by depriving workers of the benefit of a secret ballot in deciding whether or not they want to join a union .
In the words of The Times article , this is " a bill that unions hope will add millions of new members by giving workers the right to union recognition as soon as a majority of employees at a workplace sign pro-union cards .
The bill would take away management 's ability to insist on a secret ballot election . "
Here we have it .
Obama is against the secret ballot .
No , he 's not yet announced any opposition to the secret ballot in elections for public office .
But there 's absolutely no difference in principle between being against the secret ballot in elections concerning whether or not to unionize and being against it in elections for public office .
In both cases , it is a matter of subjecting people to intimidation if they express a choice that is opposed to the one that an organized , powerful group wants them to make .
In this case , that group would be the union goons who would distribute the " pro-union cards " that workers would be asked to sign or refuse to sign in their presence .
Are Obama and his followers really so naive as not to know that any worker who would reject joining a union in these circumstances would , at a minimum , be exposing himself to ostracism and the chance of substantial personal economic loss in the event the union gained recognition and he is on record as having opposed it ?
Be assured , they are not so naive .
They look forward to the intimidation .
They look forward to it in the recognition that that is what is required to swell the ranks of the unions once again .
The wider principle here is the readiness of Obama and his associates to resort to intimidation to further their goals .
It is the method of street thugs and of dictators .
That is what is present in their attempt to deprive workers of the secret ballot in deciding whether or not to unionize .
The last occupant of the White House often gave the impression of having an inadequate command of the English language and of experiencing great difficulty in speaking in grammatical sentences and using words in accordance with their proper meaning .
The present occupant of the White House speaks impeccable English , with crisp , clear pronunciation .
Nevertheless , his actual knowledge — of economics , of the meaning of individual rights , and of the nature of government — appears to lag far behind that of his bumbling predecessor .
Furthermore , while Bush may be accused of disregarding the rights of foreign terrorists at war with the United States , Obama is out to disregard the rights of peaceful , productive American citizens .
This is apparent not only in his readiness to deprive American workers of the secret ballot in union organizing elections , but also in his efforts to dramatically raise the taxes of everyone earning more than $ 250,000 per year , in an attempt to achieve a substantial redistribution of income .
It is also evident in his policies on energy and healthcare as well .
In sum , the " change " that Obama promised his mesmerized supporters in the election campaign , and is now in process of actually delivering , is nothing more than change from dumb to dumber and from bad to worse .
' A weak currency arises from a weak economy , which in turn is the result of a weak government . "
That was Gordon Brown , speaking in the wake of the exchange rate mechanism debacle in 1992 .
Today , sterling has never been weaker .
Its 25 % decline on a trade - weighted basis since June 2007 is the steepest on record .
Of the 17 currencies that make up its trade - weighted basket , sterling has fallen against all but the Icelandic krona , the South Korean won and the South African rand .
Sterling has even fallen against the Hungarian forint - a currency that has already received two dollops of IMF aid .
This may well be the first truly global recession of the modern age , but the inescapable fact is that it is also a sterling event .
Far smaller declines have in the past prompted so - called sterling crises - by our reckoning there have been seven " crises " since 1945 .
This could be the eighth .
Should the UK authorities be worried ?
In our view , the answer is yes .
A weaker currency is not necessarily a bad thing .
It makes home production relatively cheaper than foreign production .
It can help sow the seeds of recovery by providing an escape valve for countries in deflation and in need of rebalancing .
But you can have too much of a good thing : ask any Icelander .
The majority of sterling 's 25 % decline since mid-2007 can probably be attributed to a rise in the risk premium - that is the extra reward , over and above its rate of interest , overseas investors require in order to be persuaded to hold a currency .
This probably reflects a widespread loss of confidence in the UK 's tripartite policy framework .
But it also likely reflects a fear that the framework may not be capable of delivering the stability it was once thought to have enshrined .
In order to know whether sterling 's decline is cause for worry or cheer , we need to examine its causes .
Research commissioned by the Monetary Policy Forum suggests sterling may have moved to a permanently lower level , reflecting a preference shift away from what the UK was thought to do best : financial services .
We attribute about 30 % of sterling 's decline to this factor .
The drop in UK rates to levels not seen for 300 years has also played a part , explaining about 10 % of the move .
But our results suggest roughly 60 % of the explanation lies in a higher risk premium .
Put plainly , the UK and its currency are now perceived as a riskier bet .
Sterling 's decline may be telling us that overseas investors see a significant risk of inflation ahead .
It 's not hard to see why .
It took the Bank of England far too long to appreciate the potential damage the build - up of household debt and the associated bubble in house prices might cause .
The ensuing crisis has forced the banking system into the government 's arms , pushing up net government debt , which Brown pledged to keep always below 40 % of GDP , to well over 100 % .
History teaches us that governments deep in debt are more likely to tolerate higher inflation .
And this week the Bank of England began creating money in order to buy some of this outstanding debt - in effect monetising the deficit .
And yet , according to the latest forecast from Threadneedle Street , there is almost no chance of inflation breaching its 2 % target before the end of 2012 .
In our view , this is not credible .
We believe the UK authorities are downplaying the risk of high and volatile medium - term inflation .
And that in itself further underlines the risk to investors of holding sterling .
If that perception is allowed to become a self - fulfilling prophecy , Britain will be the poorer for it .

Jacqui Smith says she has fully complied with parliamentary rules Jacqui Smith has said her decision to claim " second home " expenses for her family home was " above board " and approved by the Commons authorities .
Ms Smith reportedly claimed £ 116,000 in expenses for her Redditch home after telling the Commons that her sister 's London home was her main residence .
The home secretary said she had " received assurances " from the Commons authorities that her conduct was right .
The Conservatives said on Monday that she " may have questions to answer " .
A formal complaint has been made to the parliamentary standards watchdog about Ms Smith 's behaviour .
Formal complaint
The Standards Commissioner said it had received the complaint - from pressure group Centre for Open Politics - but made clear it had not decided whether to look into the issue .
According to the Mail on Sunday , Ms Smith has claimed more than £ 116,000 in second home expenses , known as the Additional Costs Allowance , over several years .
It has been reported that Ms Smith stays at her sister 's home when she is London , normally between Monday and Thursday .
The allowance is to help cover the cost of MPs having to have a second home - or place to stay - in London if their constituency is too far away to allow commuting to Parliament .
It can cover mortgage interest , fuel bills and things like a new kitchen , bathroom or even the purchase of items such as flat screen televisions and fridges .
I have abided by the rules
Jacqui Smith
The rules state that the main residence is where the MP " spends more nights than any other " .
Under the rules , which have been in the spotlight over the past year , Parliament leaves it up to MPs to decide whether their London or constituency home is their " second home " .
In a statement on Tuesday - her first since the controversy arose - Ms Smith said she had checked with the Parliamentary authorities that her expenses arrangements were in order and had been assured they were .
" I have abided by the rules , " she said .
" Everything I have done is above board . "
Speaking during a visit to domestic violence charity Refuge in central London , she said : " The thing with being MPs is we have to live in more than one place .
" I have always been very clear with the authorities about the arrangements that I made .
I specifically asked whether or not the home where my children live had to be my main home .
I received assurances it did n't have to be .
" Because we live in two places , that 's why we make the arrangements that we do . "
' Reasonable test ' A No 10 spokesman came out in support for Ms Smith on Monday , saying she had explained her actions and that they had been verified by the Commons authorities .
But Mr Cameron said it was right that Ms Smith should be expected to justify her arrangements as " reasonable " .
" There are rules and you have to meet both the letter and the spirit [ of the rules ] and explain in a reasonable way ' this is the arrangement I have and I think it is a reasonable one ' . "
The Lib Dems have said they will ask the Commons authorities to look again at the designation of first and second homes .
The rules over designating a main residence were recently clarified after a complaint about Ms Smith 's cabinet colleagues Ed Balls and Yvette Cooper .
They were cleared in October of any wrong - doing over earmarking their constituency home in Yorkshire as their main residence rather than their London home .
In his ruling on that case standards commissioner John Lyon said it was difficult to determine which home MPs should claim as their main home .
Mr Lyon concluded his report by saying that the " normal criteria " that the main home should be where an MP spends more nights than anywhere else should remain the " reasonable general test " .

During a high - powered Game Developers Conference luncheon event attended by Gamasutra , Blizzard executive Rob Pardo suggested that game developers sometimes put too high a premium on innovation at the expense of execution .
The comment was part of a discussion also involving Junction Point 's Warren Spector and inXile 's Brian Fargo .
Spector had kicked off the discussion by lamenting the limited spectrum of game settings and experiences .
" I am so sick of games being , ' Is the guy going to get an axe in the head ? ' " he said .
" I think the kind of fantasies we provide are n't helping . "
Fargo , who had a great deal of experience working with successful fantasy properties at Interplay , which he founded , disagreed , saying that some settings just work better for games .
" [ Blizzard ] are the kings of knowing what works , " he pointed out .
" Why did [ Blizzard ] pick high fantasy ?
There 's a good reason , and it's not because Blizzard is n't clever . "
The studio behind World of Warcraft ended up being a frequent topic of discussion over the course of the session , and though there was likely more discussion about the developer than there was total input by Pardo himself , he did weigh in here .
" I think we sometimes value innovation too highly , " said Pardo of the game development community .
" We really do n't teach lessons of execution enough .
It 's not necessarily that there are a lot of fantasy games .
I do n't think that 's so much the problem as that there are a lot of bad fantasy games . "
Pardo pointed to Nintendo as a company that is " always nailing the execution " -- something Blizzard holds at its core , with obviously lucrative results .
" You get rewarded for that , " he concluded .
Well , as a result of the “ withdrawal ”  forced this week by the Israel Lobby  of Charles Freeman as Chairman of the National Intelligence Council , we now know how the Washington Institute for Near East Policy had the temerity to issue [ . pdf ] last week what we foolishly previously thought was only advice to President Obama ;
“ If the international community appears unable to stop Iran ’s nuclear progress , Israel may decide to act unilaterally .
Whatever Americans may think , Israeli leaders seem convinced that at least for now , they have a military option .
“ However , Israelis see the option fading over the next one to two years , not only because of Iran ’s nuclear progress and dispersion of its program but also because improved Iranian air defenses , especially the expected delivery of the S - 300 surface - to - air missile system from Russia , are seen by Israel as seriously limiting its military options .
“ Israel therefore may feel compelled to act before the option disappears . ”
So , now that we know the WINEP “ Presidential Task Force ” was actually telling  not merely advising  our newly elected President what to do , read on .
“ Russia argues that its potential transfer of the S - 300 air - defense system to Iran [ to defend the multi- billion - dollar nuclear power plant Russia has just built at Bushehr ] is stabilizing because it would greatly complicate any Israeli plans to strike Iran .
However , this approach gives rise to the grave risk that Israel could feel compelled to act before the cost of doing so is too high . ”
Translation ?
Dont allow the Iranians to defend themselves against an Israeli attack .
Bargain with the Russians .
Offer , for example , to cancel the U.S. anti-ballistic missile system slated to be sited in Poland if Russia will agree to cancel the slated transfer of the five Russian S - 300PMU - 2 anti-missile / aircraft systems to Iran .
( According to some reports , Iran and Syria already have more than a few of the less capable S - 300PMU - 1 anti-missile / aircraft systems and there have been suggestions that the August 2007 Israeli attack on a “ suspected nuclear site ” in Syria may have been , in reality , a demonstration of Israels ability to defeat that same system in Iran . )
But Russian President Medvedev told reporters that presenting the ABM - system cancellations as some sort of “ exchange ” was “ not productive . ”
Nevertheless , perhaps grasping at straws , the Jerusalem Post has reported that “ a Moscow source ” says the “ possibility ” of a “ freeze ” on the sale of the “ state of the art ” S -300 system “ cannot be ruled out . ”
Well , that s a relief .
Because , according to the WINEP Presidential Task Force 
“ If the transfer proceeds , Washington should rebalance the strategic equation through more sophisticated arms transfers .
That is , if Iran deploys advanced air defenses , the United States should promptly provide Israel with the capabilities to continue to threaten high - value Iranian targets  for instance , with more modern aircraft . ”
Translation ?
The Israelis believe that , with only Irans existing air - defense system in place , they can launch  in flagrant violation of UN Security Council Resolution 487  with impunity , yet another premeditated attack upon facilities subject to a Safeguards Agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency .
UNSCR 487 reads , in part ;
“ Deeply concerned about the danger to international peace and security created by the premeditated Israeli air attack on Iraqi nuclear installations on 7 June 1981 , which could at any time explode the situation in the area , with grave consequences for the vital interests of all States ,
“ Considering that , under the terms of Article 2 , paragraph 4 , of the Charter of the United Nations : ‘ All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State , or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations , ’
“ Strongly condemns the military attack by Israel in clear violation of the Charter of the United Nations and the norms of international conduct ; Calls upon Israel to refrain in the future from any such acts or threats thereof ; Further considers that the said attack constitutes a serious threat to the entire IAEA safeguards regime which is the foundation of the non-proliferation Treaty ; ”
Now , back then , in 1981 , the United States voted for UNSCR 487 , thereby strongly condemning the attack by Israel in clear violation of the UN Charter .
Furthermore , back then , we called upon Israel to refrain in the future from even threatening such attacks .
Finally , back then , we considered that any such future attack would effectively put an end to the entire NPT - IAEA nuke proliferation - prevention regime .
But then  according to Mearsheimer and Walt 
“ The [ Israel ] Lobby created its own think tank in 1985 , when Martin Indyk helped to found the Washington Institute for Near East Policy ( WINEP ) .
Although WINEP plays down its links to Israel , claiming instead to provide a ‘ balanced and realistic ’ perspective on Middle East issues , it is funded by individuals deeply committed to advancing Israel ’s agenda . ”
So , is WINEP now calling for Israel to refrain from even threatening to “ preventively ” attack Iranian IAEA Safeguarded facilities .
And , does WINEP , now , consider that an actual premeditated attack by Israel on Irans IAEA Safeguarded facilities would sound the death - knell for the IAEA - NPT nuke proliferation - prevention regime ?
Well , no , according to WINEP , it is Irans insistence upon exercising its “ inalienable rights ”  affirmed by the NPT , the IAEA Statue and the Iranian Safeguards Agreement  that will sound that death - knell .
“ If Iran ‘ gets away ’ at low cost with years of safeguards violations and defiance of UN Security Council resolutions , nonproliferation norms likely will further erode across the globe .
Other countries may consider taking the same path , especially if Iran ’s programs gain legitimacy . ”
Never mind that “ violations ” of any Safeguards Agreement can result from improper application of health and safety regulations , and in Irans case , all “ violations ”  once alleged  have been speedily corrected .
Never mind that Iran  as well as most of the member states of the Organization of the Islamic Conference and of the Non-Aligned Movement  consider the Security Council resolutions in question to be contrary to the UN Charter .
Iranian Foreign Minister Mottaki had this to say two years ago when he was finally allowed to address the Security Council , after UNSCR 1747 had already passed .
“ There is every reason to assert that the Security Council ’s consideration of the Iranian peaceful nuclear program has no legal basis , since the referral of the case to the Council [ by the IAEA Board ] and then the adoption of resolutions [ by the UNSC ] fail to meet the minimum standards of legality .
“ Iran ’s peaceful nuclear activities cannot , by any stretch of law , fact or logic , be characterized as a threat to peace . ”
Unless , of course , you happen to be a member of the motley crew that has just signed on to WINEPs “ Preventing a Cascade of Instability : U.S. Engagement to Check Iranian Nuclear Progress . ”
