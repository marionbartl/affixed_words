For almost two decades , Philip Skeates woke up dog tired , even though he had just spent a good 12 hours in bed .
He would get up for breakfast , then stagger back to bed until noon .
By eight at night he was nodding off .
Eventually his wife persuaded him to seek medical help .
Her husband , 39 , was completely exhausted , and she was suffering too .
To the amazement of experts , he was diagnosed with one of the worst cases of sleep apnoea - a condition that causes the airways to close - that had ever been seen in Britain .
It meant that Skeates stopped breathing every 40 seconds or so during the night .
He would briefly wake up , without properly regaining consciousness , and then fall back to sleep .
And the process would begin over again .
Doctors estimated Skeates was only actually sleeping for a few seconds at a time , and for less than 15 minutes in total every night .
" Every day I would get up feeling exhausted , " he said .
" I could n't concentrate and I was ratty with my family .
I could n't understand it because I would fall asleep in my chair by 8 pm and not get out of bed for 12 hours .
But in fact I was hardly getting any sleep at all .
It was miserable for me and it just was n't fair on my family . "
He finally visited his GP because his snoring - an effect of the condition - was so loud that his wife , Lisa , 40 , a teaching assistant and their three children , were kept awake .
She also became alarmed at how quiet and still her husband became in between the bouts of loud snoring .
Skeates was referred to the Great Western hospital near the family home in Swindon , Wiltshire , where his sleep was monitored and the results were startling .
Doctors found he stopped breathing 90 times an hour .
" The doctors said it was one of the worst cases they had ever seen , " he explained .
" I was really only getting 14 minutes of sleep . "
Happily , Skeates is now getting a good night 's rest for the first time since the early nineties .
The hospital arranged to have a continuous positive airway pressure machine installed at Skeates 's home .
It contains an oxygen mask and tube which he must wear while he sleeps .
The equipment forces air into the lungs and keeps the airways clear .
His snoring stopped instantly and within weeks he was feeling refreshed after just seven hours of sleep .
He has lost weight and is learning to love life again .
Skeates said : " This has changed my life .
The very first night I had it I noticed a difference the next morning .
Now I wake up in the morning feeling so much more refreshed . "
Professor John Straddling , consultant chest physician at the Churchill hospital in Oxford , said there were around 300,000 sufferers of sleep apnoea in Britain though only about one in five is diagnosed .
He said : " Many GPs and primary care trusts are unwilling to diagnose sleep apnoea although it has a horrendous impact on these patients ' lives .
This affects us all .
Undiagnosed patients cost the NHS a lot of money as they get older , and the condition affects us all in the form of road accidents . "
Lisa Skeates said the cure had " reawakened " their marriage .
" It 's been wonderful .
Phil is so much more energetic and cheerful .
For 17 years the snoring got worse and worse until it was like sleeping next to a pneumatic drill .
It was horrendous .
" At most , I would get a couple of hours sleep , and I 'm a teacher so it was terrible .
The children sleep upstairs and they could hear it through the floorboards .
I tried earplugs and sometimes , when it was really bad , I would go and sleep on the sofa just to get a bit of rest .
" Now we have a laugh together again and we 're also able to do things as a family which we never did before because he was always so tired .
I 've also been able to have a good night 's sleep for the first time in years . "
FAQ : Sleep apnoea
What is sleep apnoea ?
It 's a relatively common condition that occurs when breathing stops or gets shallow during sleep , with pauses lasting for 10 to 20 seconds or more
Who gets it ?
According to the British Snoring & Sleep Apnoea Association , it occurs in around 4 % of men but is very rare in women
What are the symptoms ?
People with apnoea often do not know they have problems breathing at night .
They tend to snore loudly ( though not everyone who snores has sleep apnoea ) and not feel rested when they wake
Are there different types ?
The most common form is obstructive sleep apnoea , where not enough air flows into the lungs , causing blood oxygen to fall .
When normal breathing returns , it usually starts again with a loud snort or choking sound .
Another form is central sleep apnoea , a neurological condition that stops all breathing during sleep .
A person with this form is normally woken by an automatic breathing reflex , so ends up getting very little sleep
How dangerous is it ?
Besides tiredness , if left untreated , sleep apnoea can increase the risk of high blood pressure , heart attacks or stroke
Can it be cured ?
In most cases , it can be treated with a device that keeps a person 's airways open during the night using a flow of pressurised air into the throat .
There are also drugs that can help .
Milder cases can be treated with a slight change in lifestyle : avoiding alcohol or muscle relaxants can help .
Losing weight and quitting smoking is also suggested .
Sleeping at a 30 - degree angle also seems to work in some cases
Washington D.C. , March 29 , 2007 - New documents published today by the National Security Archive shed light on recent revelations about the links between bananas and terror in Colombia and the Colombian government 's own ties to the country 's illegal paramilitary forces .
The scandal is further detailed in an article by National Security Archive Colombia analyst Michael Evans published today on the Web site of The Nation magazine .
The March 9 , 2007 , indictment against Chiquita Brands International sheds light on both corporate and state ties to Colombia 's illegal paramilitary forces .
Earlier this month , Chiquita , the international fruit corporation , admitted to funding a Colombian terrorist group and agreed to pay a $ 25 million fine .
The Justice Department indictment , filed March 13 in D.C. Federal Court , states that Chiquita gave more than $ 1.7 million to the United Self - Defense Forces of Colombia ( Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia - AUC ) , an illegal right - wing anti-guerrilla group tied to many of the country 's most notorious civilian massacres .
Key documents from the Chiquita case , along with a collection of newly - available declassified documents , are posted here today .
The payments were made over seven years from 1997 - 2004 .
At least $ 825,000 in payments came after the AUC was designated a Foreign Terrorist Organization by the U.S. State Department in 2001 .
Many of these payments were made through " intermediaries " in a Colombian government - sponsored program known as Convivir , a network of rural security cooperatives established by the military to police rural areas and provide intelligence on leftist insurgents .
Declassified documents suggest that Convivir members often collaborated with paramilitary operations .
The Convivir connection is especially important now , as current President Álvaro Uribe was a key sponsor of the program while governor of Anitoquia department .
Antioquia 's banana - growing Urabá region is also the locus of Chiquita 's Colombia operations .
As president , Uribe has implemented similar programs involving the use of civilian informants and soldiers .
The article published today , along with additional documents included here , describes a pattern of increasingly - strong links between military and paramilitary forces in Urabá over the period of Chiquita 's payments to the AUC .
Chiquita 's relationship with the group coincided with a massive projection of paramilitary power thoughout Colombia .
U.S. officials strongly suspected that these operations were at least tolerated by -- and at times coordinated with -- Colombian security forces .
The Chiquita - Convivir scandal comes as the Los Angeles Times has published a report that the CIA has new information connecting Colombia 's Army chief , Gen. Mario Montoya , one of President Uribe 's top advisers , to a paramilitary group .
The new allegation adds fuel to the " para - politics " scandal , which has already taken down several top government officials and implicated many others in connection to the AUC .
Today 's posting is the first in a series of new Archive postings on the U.S. government 's perception of Colombia 's paramiltary movement and its links to Colombian security forces .
Under a program developed by the Uribe government to disarm and demobilize the AUC , paramilitary leaders are eligible for reduced prison sentences in exchange for voluntary confessions and the payment of reparations to their victims .
However , the commission established to adjudicate this process is not authorized to investigate state crimes or the history of the government 's links to paramilitary forces .
Documents made available on the Archive Web site today include :
the Justice Department 's indictment in the Chiquita case , detailing the company 's relationship with AUC chief Carlos Castaño , the fugitive ( and now deceased ) paramilitary leader ;
a U.S. Embassy cable in which Colombia 's police intelligence chief " sheepishly " admitted that his forces " do not act " in parts of the country under AUC control ;
another Embassy cable in which Ambassador Myles Frechette warned that the government 's Convivir program was liable to " degenerate into uncontrolled paramilitary groups " ;
a U.S. military intelligence report on a Colombian Army colonel who told of the " potential " for the Convivir " to devolve into full - fledged paramilitaries " ;
and CIA reports on the Colombian Army 's paramilitary ties , one of which found that armed forces commanders had " little inclination to combat paramilitary groups . "

THE INDICTMENT
United States of America v. Chiquita Brands International , Inc. , Defendant , March 13 , 2007
The indictment details Chiquita 's seven - year relationship with Carlos Castaño's AUC .
The paramilitary chief arranged the payments in 1997 with Banadex , a wholly - owned Chiquita subsidiary .
Castaño " informed the [ Banadex ] General Manager that the AUC was about to drive the FARC [ guerrillas ] out of Urabá , " and also that " failure to make the payments could result in physical harm to Banadex personnel and property . "
The company was to " make payments to an intermediary known as a ' convivir , ' " groups used by the AUC " as fronts to collect money from businesses for use to support its illegal activities . "
The Convivir were rural security cooperatives established by the military to police rural areas and provide intelligence on leftist insurgents .
The Justice Department lists some 50 payments made by Chiquita after the State Deparment designated the AUC a terrorist organization in September 2001 .
The company made at least 19 of these payments after the company voluntarily disclosed the payments to the Justice Department in April 2003 , and despite strong warnings from its lawyers to terminate the relationship .
" Must stop payments , " read one note quoted in the indictment .
" Bottom Line : CANNOT MAKE THE PAYMENT "
" Advised NOT TO MAKE ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT throught CONVIVIR . "
" General Rule : Cannot do indirectly what you cannot do directly . "
" You voluntarily put yourself in this position .
Duress defense can wear out through repetition .
Buz [ business ] decision to stay in harm 's way .
Chiquita should leave Colombia . "
DECLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS
Document 1 : U.S. Embassy Bogotá , cable , Botero Human Rights Letter to A/S Shattuck , December 9 , 1994
The U.S. Embassy was skeptical when first confronted with the Colombian defense ministry 's plan to create the network of " rural security cooperatives " that would ultimately come to be known as Convivir .
In a cable that covered an array of human rights issues , Ambassador Myles Frechette was emphatic about the proposal 's inherent dangers :
" We believe that the point that needs to be made to the minister is that Colombia 's protracted , vaguely ideological internal conflict is quite sui generis and that there has never been an example in Colombia of a para- statal security group that has not ultimately operated with wanton disregard for human rights or been corrupted by local economic interests . "
Document 2 : U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency , Intelligence Information Report , Colar 17th Brigade Responsible for the Uraba Antioquia Region , April 29 , 1996
This report from the U.S. military attaché in Colombia describes the security situation in Urabá , the region where much of Chiquita 's operations are located .
The document describes a tense situation involving ongoing struggles between EPL and FARC guerrillas , " fighting each other for control of unions and politics in the banana area . "
According to the indictment , from 1989 until the AUC payments began in 1997 , Chiquita had been making similar payments to Colombian guerilla groups .
The commander of the Army 's local 17th Brigade , Gen. Rito Alejo del Río , told the attaché " that paramilitaries are the only individuals that subversive elements fear . "
Document 3 : U.S. Embassy Bogotá , cable , Samper Hosts Governors ' Meeting on Crime , October 9 , 1996
Following a meeting with Colombian President Ernesto Samper and other government officials , the U.S. Embassy reported that Antioquia Governor Álvaro Uribe ( the current president of Colombia ) had called for " the proliferation of the controversial civilian rural security cooperatives known collectively as ' Convivir . ' "
Uribe said that the Convivir had " led to the capture of guerrilla leaders in the region , " and called on the government to arm some of the groups .
The Embassy adds the comment that " most human rights observers believe the Convivir groups pose a serious danger of becoming little more that vigilante organizations . "
The government 's human rights ombudsman had " begun to receive complaints against these groups for exceeding their mandate , " according to the Embassy report .
Document 4 : U.S. Embassy Bogotá , cable , 40,000 Colombians March to Protest Wave of Kidnappings ; Paramilitary Group Releases Two Guerrilla Relatives , December 2 , 1996
In a testament to the AUC 's growing influence among Colombian security forces , Colombia 's police intelligence chief " sheepishly " told U.S. Embassy officers that " the police ' do not act ' in the part of Urabá under [ Carlos ] Castano 's control . "
The statement came in response to an Embassy query as to why Colombian police had not arrested Castaño , " who had openly admitted to kidnapping guerrilla relatives . "
Document 5 : U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency , Intelligence Information Report , Colombian Prosecutor Comments on Paramilitaries in Uraba , December 7 , 1996
Paramilitaries had become " a law unto themselves " in Urabá constituting " a potentially greater threat to the government than ... the guerrillas , " according to this military intelligence report , based on comments from a Colombian prosecutor .
The document describes the violence there as " basically a turf war to determine which group [ paramilitaries or guerrillas ] will control the rich banana - growing region ( and the lucrative illicit narcotics operations within it ) . "
The report adds that , " The military 's influence and control over paramilitaries that we so often logically assume to exist may , in fact , be tenuous at best and non-existent in some cases . "
Document 6 : U.S. Embassy Bogotá , cable , Retired Army Colonel Lambastes Military for Inaction Against Paramilitaries , January 11 , 1997
In January 1997 , retired Army Colonel Carlos Alfonso Velásquez publicly criticized the Colombian Army , particularly 17th Brigade Commander Gen. Rito Alejo del Río , for tolerance of paramilitary forces in Urabá .
In this cable , the U.S. Embassy characterizes Velásquez as a man of " unquestionable integrity , " adding that his statements " bring extra pressure to bear on the Colombian military " and " add credibility " to the State Department 's critical human rights report on Colombia .
Document 7 : U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency , Intelligence Information Report , Guerrillas Launch New Wave of Bombings in Uraba and Cordoba -- Paramilitaries Respond with Murder and Kidnappings ( Laser Strike ) , March 14 , 1997
U.S. military intelligence reports ongoing violence in Urabá , noting that , " Recent events contrast sharply with earlier 17th Brigade reports claiming that Uraba had largely been pacified . "
The report says it remains unclear whether a recent shift by FARC guerillas to " terrorist - style bombings " represents " a long - term FARC strategy , or a temporary tactic for retaliating against the paramilitaries for driving them out of certain conflictive zones and discouraging the civilian population from assisting paramilitary organizations . "
The document adds that the Colombian government had only recently " acknowledged that paramilitaries are a valid threat to public order that requires attention . "
Document 8 : U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency , Intelligence Information Report , The Convivir in Antioquia -- Becoming Institutionalized and Spreading Its Reach , April 7 , 1997
In this document , an undisclosed source describes how the Convivir operate in Antioquia .
The interlocutor was " insistent that there are striking differences between the legal ... sanctioned Convivirs and the illegal paramilitaries that are declared enemies of the state . "
The Convivir are merely " one more ' legal tool ' for integrating counterguerrilla - oriented elements into society . "
Document 9 : U.S. Embassy Bogotá , cable , MoD Alleged to have Authorized Illegal Arms Sales to Convivirs and Narcotraffickers , April 9 , 1997
In April 1997 , a Colombian magazine published allegations that officials in Colombia 's Ministry of Defense had illegally sold weapons to Convivir linked to narcotraffickers and paramilitaries .
This highly - excised document indicates that U.S. Embassy military and diplomatic contacts had " lent a significant degree of credibility to the allegations . "
Document 10 : U.S. State Department , cable , Bedoya Call for Militia , April 11 , 1997
In this cable , the State Department 's Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Latin America , Peter Romero , criticizes a new plan by Gen. Harold Bedoya , the armed forces commander , to create " national militias . "
Romero mentions problems the government has had with the Convivir program , adding that " establishing yet another set of armed combatants would , if experience is any guide , bring a host of more flagrant human rights abuses . "
Document 11 : CIA , Intelligence Report , Colombia : Paramilitaries Gaining Strength , June 13 , 1997
This CIA report finds " scant indication that the [ Colombian ] military leadership is making an effort to directly confront the paramilitary groups or to devote men or resources to stop their activities in an amount commensurate with the dimensions of the problem . "
Logistical problems and the " popular perception that the military is ' losing the war ' against the guerrillas " has had a profound effect on military forces .
As a result of these frustrations , " informational links and instances of active coordination between military and paramilitaries are likely to continue , " according the the CIA .
The following month -- in an operation that signalled the beginning of a major expansion of paramilitary power throughout Colombia -- Urab á- based paramilitaries under the direction of Carlos Castaño would massacre some 30 civilians at Mapiripán , an act later shown to have been facilitated by local military forces .
Document 12 : U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency , Intelligence Information Report , Senior Colombian Army Officer Biding His Time During Remainder of Samper Regime , July 15 , 1997
A " senior Colombian Army officer " told U.S. offiicials in July 1997 that there were " serious problems with the legal ' Convivir ' movement , " according to this military intelligence report .
The unnamed officer compared the Convivir to the " Rondas Campesinas " in Peru , calling them " very difficult to control . "
According to the colonel , the Ministry of Defense was aware of the " potential for Convivir's to devolve into full - fledged paramilitaries , " but was " reluctant to admit it publicly . "
Document 13 : U.S. Embassy Bogotá , cable , Scandal Over Army Request to Convivir in Antioquia , October 8 , 1997
This cable reports on the October 1997 revelation by Colombian Senator Fabio Valencia that a high - ranking Colombian Army officer had circulated a memo asking local Convivir organizations to " to send the Army lists of local candidates , including their political affiliations , degree of acceptance among the people , their sympathies toward democratic institutions , government and military forces , and what degree of local influence they wield . "
Document 14 : U.S. Embassy Bogotá , cable , Paramilitary Massacres Leave 21 Dead , November 24 , 1997
After Mapiripán , one of the next major projections of paramilitary power in Colombia was the November 21 , 1997 , La Horqueta massacre , in which paramilitaries killed 14 people in a village outside the Colombian capital .
Eyewitnesses believed the attackers came from Colombia 's northern coast , which the Embassy notes is " home of Carlos Castaño 's paramilitary group . "
A prominent Colombian expert told the Embassy that the massacre " sent a message to the FARC that the paramilitaries can go anywhere and do anything . "
" The fact that no trace of the killers has turned up yet despite the presence of hundreds of police and soldiers in the wake of the killings is not encouraging , " according to the cable .
Document 15 : CIA , Intelligence Report , Colombia : Update on Links Between Military , Paramilitary Forces , December 2 , 1997
This highly - excised CIA report states that " prospects for a concerted effort by the military high command to crack down on paramilitaries -- and the officers that cooperate with them - - appear dim . "
Both the current and former armed forces chiefs -- Gens . Manuel Bonett and Harold Bedoya -- had shown " little inclination to combat paramilitary groups . "
Tacit acceptance of paramilitary operations by some officers " are longstanding and will not be easily reversed , " according to the report .
The CIA calls the recent paramilitary expansion into traditionally guerrilla - controlled territory " the most significant change we have seen in recent months and one which has further degraded Colombia 's already poor security and human rights situation . "
The Mapiripán massacre was one notable example .
One intelligence source told the CIA " that Castano would not have flown forces and weapons into a civilian airport known to have a large police presence if he had not received prior assurances that they would be allowed to pass through . "
Document 16 : U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency , Intelligence Information Report , Cashiered Colonel Talks Freely about the Army He Left Behind ( Laser Strike ) , December 24 , 1997
There is a " body count syndrome " in the Colombian Army 's counterinsurgency strategy that " tends to fuel human rights abuses by otherwise well - meaning soldiers trying to get their quota to impress superiors , " according to a recently - retired Colombian Army colonel whose comments form the basis of this intelligence report .
According to the officer , the obsession with body counts is in part responsible for commanders " allowing the paramilitaries to serve as proxies for the [ Colombian army ] in contributing to the guerrilla body count . "
The 17th Brigade in Urabá had been cooperating with paramilitaries " for a number of years , " he said , but it " had gotten much worse " under the command of Gen. Rito Alejo del Río. Gen. Del Río was later indicted but ultimately acquitted of collusion with paramilitaries by the Prosecutor General 's office in May 2003 .
The officer was critical of several other high - level military commanders , including Gen. Jorge Enrique Mora , who would later serve as armed forces commander .
Mora had a clean public reputation , according to the officer , but was " probably was one of those who looked the other way " with respect to collaboration with paramilitaries .
Former armed forces commander Gen. Harold Bedoya " fell into the same category , " in that both officers " never allowed themselves to become directly involved in encouraging or supporting paramilitary activities , but they turned their backs to what was happening and felt the [ Colombian army ] should in no way be blamed for any resulting human rights atrocities committed . "
Document 17 : U.S. Embassy Bogotá , cable , Narcos Arrested for La Horqueta Paramilitary Massacre , January 28 , 1998
One of the perpetrators of the November 1997 La Horqueta massacre ( see Document 14 ) was identified as the president of an Urabá - based Convivir , according to this U.S. Embassy cable .
The Convivir member was " imported to the region " by a " local landowner and presumed narcotrafficker who had hired ... Uraba - based paramilitaries to execute the massacre . "
The local Army 13th Brigade was " strangely non-reactive " to the killings , according to the cable .
The brigade , the Embassy adds , " recently came under the command of BG Rito Alejo del Rio , who earned considerable attention as the commander of the 17th Brigade covering the heartland of Carlos Castano 's paramilitaries in Cordoba and Uraba . "
Document 18 : CIA , Intelligence Report , Colombia : Paramilitaries Assuming a Higher Profile , August 31 , 1998
Similar to a previous document on the matter , this CIA report finds that " some senior military officers -- already suspicious of the peace process and frustrated with the military 's dismal performance on the battlefield -- may increasingly view turning a blind eye -- and perhaps even offering tacit support to -- the paramilitaries as their best option for striking back at the guerrillas . "
Like the previous report , this one also predicts that " informational links and instances of active coordination between the military and the paramilitaries " were " likely to continue and perhaps even increase . "
Document 19 : U.S. Embassy Bogotá , cable , A Closer Look at Uribe 's Auxiliary Forces , September 11 , 2002
Soon after taking office in 2002 , Colombian President Álvaro Uribe announced that a key aspect of his national security strategy would involve the use of civilian soldiers organized into local militias .
Key portions of this U.S. Embassy cable on the use of " auxiliary forces " were deleted before release by the State Department , suggesting that the Embassy may have harbored reservations about the program based on the government 's previous experience with the Convivir .

Extrapolation of what 's happening " now " is one of the most dangerous things in trying to predict the future .
If something is growing quickly today , it does n't mean that will last .
Take social networks for example .
Historically , they have a pretty standard pattern .
There 's a huge rush of growth , as people think it 's new and neat , and they sign up all their friends .
Then there 's a flat period where people are still using it , but some begin to question why .
Then people start to realize that , beyond reconnecting with some old friends and acquaintances , there really is n't that much to do there -- and that realization may come even sooner if they 're getting bombarded with advertisements .
It happened way back in the '90s with Six Degrees .
It happened with Friendster in the first half of the decade .
Yet , some people and companies believed that MySpace and Facebook would be different .
Certainly , both companies recognized this problem to some extent , and have worked to add more things that you can " do " on their sites .
Both still get a ton of traffic and usage and are n't going anywhere soon .
However , there are some worrying signs .
Google recently noted that the ads it 's put on MySpace do n't perform very well ( which is something of a problem , since Google has guaranteed at least $ 900 million in ad revenue to MySpace ) .
And , now , reports are coming out that users are , on average , spending noticeably less time on both MySpace and Facebook , with some leaving it behind .
And , what better way to amusingly drive that point home , than to point out that even Bill Gates has killed his Facebook page just a few months after Microsoft dumped $ 240 million into the company ?

First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton kisses Emina Bicakcic , 8 , from Sarajevo who dedicated a poem to her shortly after her arrival at the Tuzla Air Base , Monday March 25 , 1996 .
Click the Play Button to see what Jack and our viewers had to say .
( PHOTO CREDIT : AP )
FROM CNN's Jack Cafferty :
On two different occasions , Senator Hillary Clinton has described a trip she took as first lady to Bosnia in March of 1996 .
To hear her tell it , she was lucky to escape with her life , landing in a hail of sniper fire .
She said they were forced to cut short the greeting ceremony at the airport and , " run with our heads down to get into the vehicles to get to our base . "
But apparently there was time to stop and visit at the airport with an 8 - year - old girl who greeted Mrs. Clinton on the tarmac when she landed and read her a poem .
The military commander on hand to greet Clinton at the time , Major General William Nash , told the Washington Post he was unaware of any sniper threat to Clinton during her 8 - hour stay .
Also traveling with the first lady was her daughter Chelsea , the singer Sheryl Crow and the comedian Sinbad , who said the scariest part of the trip was deciding where to eat .
Hillary Clinton claims that she was sent to places that her husband , President Clinton , could not go because they were " too dangerous . "
Back to Sinbad ...
When commenting on Clinton 's version of events , he said , " What kind of president would say , ' Hey man , I ca n't go because I might get shot … but I 'm gonna send my wife and daughter .
Oh and take a guitar player and a comedian with you . ' "
The Washington Post has awarded Senator Clinton " 4 Pinnochios " for her story about Bosnia , which it gives for major " whoppers . "
Now that all this has come to light , Clinton 's campaign is allowing as how she may have " misspoke " about her 1996 trip .
Here ’s my question to you :
Why would Hillary Clinton not tell the truth about her trip to Bosnia in March of 1996 ?
Interested to know which ones made it on air ?
Marie from Charleston , South Carolina writes :
We know the reason : to bolster her " foreign policy experience " credentials .
The sad thing to me is that she has plenty of legitimate credentials to recommend her .
This type of resume padding makes people question everything else she touts as experience , which is the crux of her campaign .
Bob from Richmond , Virginia writes :
Jack ,
She was just using a common resume - building technique , citing experience if you are in the general vicinity of a job requirement .
She also ignored the number one resume fudging rule : do n't lie if there are witnesses !
Dennis from Spokane , Washington writes :
Misspoke .
Sure , I always imagine sniper fire when my plane lands .
Good that Chelsea survived the trauma of listening to that poem while her mom was getting those scary flowers .
Alexa from Lovettsville , Virginia writes :
For the same reason as Obama lied about being in church when Wright was on one of his rants , and when Obama lied about Rezko , and when Obama lied about his campaign advisor meeting with the Canadians , and when Obama lied about how much money Rezko donated to him , etc. , etc. , etc .
It 's called politics .
Stephen from New Jersey writes :
She would n't lie about that to get elected anymore than she and Bill would look into the cameras of 60 Minutes and lie about extramarital affairs to get him elected president .
Garnet from Corning , Ohio writes :
Jack ,
If she was as qualified as she says she is on day one , she would n't have to stretch the truth .
After this one , I ask America , what else is she stretching the truth about ?
My boys are dying and being injured for life for one lie , do we really want another one ?
One more thing , what about your tax records , Hillary ?
Dan from Texas writes :
Besides dodging sniper fire , Hillary single - handedly saves her fellow travelers by frisking down a suspected suicide bomber dressed as an 8 - year - old girl !
Too funny !
Hillary and Chelsea to the rescue !
At least 27 lawsuits have been filed since 1991 over smoking in multiunit housing , and judges have often sided with the nonsmoker , Mr. Sweda said .
But many in the real estate industry believe that banning smoking in such buildings would be discriminatory and therefore illegal .
When asked by residents to enact a smoke - free policy , property managers often say they cannot because of federal fair housing laws .
In fact , the federal Fair Housing Act protects nonsmokers in cases where people have breathing disabilities aggravated by smoke .
In the summer of 2006 , First Centrum , based in Virginia , adopted a smoke - free policy for more than 5,000 units at its 46 apartment communities for older residents in Illinois , Maryland , Michigan , North Carolina , Tennessee and Virginia , said Robert Couch , president of the company ’s management division .
Over the last seven years , Guardian Management , which is based in Oregon , has banned smoking in units at five properties , and in August extended that policy to 8,000 rental units at 100 properties in Idaho , Montana , Oregon , Texas and Washington , said Tom Brenneke , the company president .
“ It was an easy decision , ” Mr. Brenneke said .
He said Guardian was motivated primarily by health and financial considerations , and he pointed out that a smoker ’s apartment cost $ 1,500 to clean when a tenant vacated , compared with $ 400 for a nonsmoker’s .
Cities in California have taken the lead in adopting smoke - free housing ordinances .
On May 8 , Temecula passed an ordinance that applies to apartment buildings with 10 or more units .
The law requires landlords to designate at least 25 percent of their units , including balconies and patios , as nonsmoking .
The ordinance is being phased in over five years .

This is all I am trying to accomplish with my blog .
When I recount stories from my experience , when I giggle with delight at a new discovery , when I describe a different way to solve problems …
All I am trying to do is share my own yearnings to sail over the horizon and see what there is to discover .
And de Saint - Exupery puts it best when he describes the sea as vast and endless .
It is truly about the journey , not the destination .
It is fascinating precisely because there is no answer , no best way , no way to decide “ we have arrived , we are done . ”
I know with certainty that when I end my journey , when I go to my rest , there will still be unsolved problems of software development .
For me , software development is an activity carried out in our minds .
Our “ sea ” is the human brain .
All of our tools and processes are ways of engineering thought and communication .
The software we build in turn is a way of guiding thought and communication .
I do not say that there is no Engineering in software development .
But I can say with confidence that there is room for considering it a form of Applied Psychology , or perhaps a specialized branch of Cognitive Science .
And what greater journey is there than the exploration of how we think , of how we solve problems , of how we communicate and coördinate our activities ?
Certainly there are practical considerations .
Ships do need wood .
Sailors must work with a purpose .
Software must get built , and it must validate phone numbers or ensure that transactions conform to ACID semantics .
But yet , the allure of our work is the sea and the mysteries it contains .
Thank you for joining me on the voyage .
If there 's one thing the digital revolution has taught us , it 's that we should n't get too attached to anything .
Technology has a way of seizing long - held ideas and entrenched industries and turning them upside - down .
Disruption is rarely the result of a single gadget or innovation , however .
It 's typically when two or more technologies converge that the real changes start to happen .
For this look at the most disruptive high - tech events of the last quarter century , we divided developments into pairs that have formed an effective one - two punch .
On the following pages are our picks for the ten technology duos with the biggest impact .
10 . DVRs + Entertainment on Demand
Remember programming your VCR to record TV shows ?
Of course you do n't , because nobody did it -- the task was too difficult and time - consuming .
Fast - forward to the late 1990s and the introduction of the TiVo and ReplayTV digital video recorders .
Time - shifting programs and fast - forwarding through commercials became as easy as pressing a couple of buttons .
Suddenly people were no longer shackled to the arbitrary schedules of TV programmers and the obnoxious pandering of advertisers .
Cable and satellite providers rushed out their own DVRs , and millions of folks began " TiVo- ing " -- even those who had never touched an actual TiVo .
Like the best disruptive tech , DVRs returned control to users -- and made consumers hungry for even more control over what they watched , when , and where .
In 2005 the Slingbox introduced place - shifting , making it possible to watch your TV ( or your TiVo 's content ) over any broadband connection .
Later that year the video - enabled iPod sealed the deal , and broadcast content was permanently untethered from the tube .
Though iTunes ' video library was far from comprehensive , it proved that if people get an easy alternative to file sharing , they will pay for what they want .
Today , video - on - demand services -- including ad - supported ones like Hulu.com that are owned and operated by the broadcasters themselves -- are booming .
Thanks to TiVo , iTunes , and other similar advances , we now expect our entertainment to be delivered to us wherever we are , whenever we want it , on any device that 's handy .
Disruption :
The whatever / wherever / whenever model of media consumption is turning both Hollywood and the consumer electronics industry on their heads , and forcing advertisers to rethink ways to capture our attention .
Living coelacanths have evolved specialized features that make the fish much different from their primitive , extinct relatives .
A 400 million - year - old fossilized fin from a strange - looking , primitive fish is shedding light on how fins evolved into limbs that enabled animals to walk on land .
The fossil fin comes from a coelacanth , a type of lobe - finned fish , and provides the only skeletal fin remains to date from the extinct relatives of today 's living coelacanths .
Scientists spotted the four - inch - long ( 10 centimeter - long ) specimen at Beartooth Butte in northern Wyoming and have dubbed the fish Shoshinia arctopteryx after the Shoshine people and the Shoshone National Forest .
When alive , the fish would have been about 18 to 24 inches ( 46 to 62 centimeters ) in length .
The finding , detailed in the July / August issue of the journal Evolution & Development , shows the arrangement of bones within the fossil fin match the fin patterns found in primitive , living ray - finned fishes , such as sturgeons , paddlefishes and sharks .
Surprisingly , however , the patterns do n't match the lobe - finned fish 's living relative .
Until now , scientists had assumed the living coelacanths and their relatives , the lungfish , served as accurate models of their ancestors dating back hundreds of millions of years ago .
" Two living fossils , coelacanths and lungfishes , are in fact not primitive , " said lead author Matt Friedman of the University of Chicago .
" They are specialized , and they are not particularly good models for understanding the origin of limbs . "
In fact , living coelacanths are adapted for deep - water habitats off the coasts of Africa and Indonesia where they use a specialized organ in their noses to detect weak electrical signals from prey hidden in the mud along the seafloor .
Unlike fins on living coelacanths and lungfishes , the fossil fin has an asymmetrical pattern in which there are more bones on the front of the central shaft than the back .
It has more in common with the anatomy of four - limbed vertebrates , called tetrapods , and even humans than it does with the anatomy of living coelacanths .
The discovery of the new fossil means scientists can no longer make inferences about the evolution of limbs based on living coelacanths and lungfishes .
“ To understand the developmental evolution of the limbs of tetrapods , we should n’t be looking at the fins of our nearest living fish relatives — lungfishes and coelacanths — because they ’re far too specialized , ” said co-author Michael Coates , a University of Chicago biologist .
A dangerous new fungus with the ability to destroy entire wheat fields has been detected in Iran , the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO ) reported today .
The wheat stem rust , whose spores are carried by wind across continents , was previously found in East Africa and Yemen and has moved to Iran , which said that laboratory tests have confirmed its presence in some localities in Broujerd and Hamedan in the country ’s west .
Up to 80 per cent of all Asian and African wheat varieties are susceptible to the fungus , and major wheat - producing nations to Iran ’s east – such as Afghanistan , India , Pakistan , Turkmenistan , Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan – should be on high alert , FAO warned .
“ The fungus is spreading rapidly and could seriously lower wheat production in countries at direct risk , ” said Shivaji Pandey , Director of FAO ’s Plant Production and Protection Division .
He urged the control of the rust ’s spread to lower the risk to countries already impacted by high food prices .
Iran has said that it will bolster its research capacity to tackle the new fungus and develop wheat varieties that are rust - resistant .
Called Ug99 , the disease first surfaced in Uganda and subsequently spread to Kenya and Ethiopia , with both countries experiencing serious crop yield losses due to a serious rust epidemic last year .
Also in 2007 , FAO confirmed that a more virulent strain was found in Yemen .
The agency appealed to countries to bolster disease surveillance and step up efforts to control it .
The Borlaug Global Rust Initiative ( BGRI ) – founded by Norman Borlaug , Cornell University , the International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas ( ICARDA ) , the Internatioanl Maize and Wheat Improvement Center ( CIMMYT ) and FAO – will continue its work in assisting countries develop drug - resistant wheat varieties , upgrading their plant protection measures and creating contingency plans .
A 1993 MORI poll in Scotland estimated that there were over 90,000 latent , or would - be , entrepreneurs and business owners in Scotland , who were frustrated in their ability to act on their aspirations by a range of factors , including the absence of role models , difficulties ( actual and perceived ) in accessing resources , particularly finance , and lack of knowledge about the process of business formation .
Based on figures from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitoring ( GEM ) research programme around 5 % of the Scottish adult population is actively engaged in business ownership or in activities being undertaken with a view to entering business ownership .
This is around one half of the level experienced in the US and around one - third the level in other small open dynamic economies such as New Zealand .
Actually achieving this increased level of entrepreneurial activity will require a quantum shift in culture and attitudes in Scotland , which may only be achievable over a generation : as the experience of the business birth rate strategy in Scotland has demonstrated , this is not a ‘ quick fix ’ option .
Specifically , access to finance is consistently cited as the prime obstacle to entrepreneurial activity in the GEM reports , and also in our research and contact with potential entrepreneurs .
As it is , at present Scotland is working at perhaps 20 % of its entrepreneurial potential .
Our view is that the 90,000 “ frustrated entrepreneurs ” identified by a 1993 MORI poll ( a figure consistent with the GEM data for Scotland a decade later ) do not become active entrepreneurs largely because the funding landscape is not only too empty , but is also perceived as empty by those looking to enter it .
While market participants respond ( with some accuracy ) that it is in fact not empty , and that sensible ideas well advised can usually find a funder , this accurate opinion is not helpful to an individual who is in full - time employment during normal working hours , has few or no contacts with the market , has little understanding of how it works , has little spare time to find out , and has a perception that entrepreneurial success relies on unique and specific skills that they may not have and may not be able to acquire .
A Darwinian approach to entrepreneurship would demand that these 90,000 aspiring entrepreneurs be left to live or die on their merits – let the fit survive and the rest remain in employment .
Such Darwinism is , however , founded on the false premise ( a ) that this process will ‘ weed out ’ weak ideas and businesses , which is economically efficient , and ( b ) that entrepreneurship ought by definition to be hard and difficult , not least because today ’s successful entrepreneurs and investors did indeed have to face harsh and difficult environments , and associate success with difficulty .
This Darwinian approach to the creation of an entrepreneurial economy is flawed , as can be seen from the failure of the Scottish economy to significantly raise the level of new business starts and the rate of formation and growth of high - potential companies over the past decade .
A funding landscape that was visibly and obviously rich in sources of risk capital for businesses of every kind would remove a major constraint ( real and perceived ) on the formation of new entrepreneurial ventures .
As such , it would provide an environment for the successful transformation of the culture of the Scottish economy into one in which entrepreneurial activity is seen as a legitimate career option and economic role .
I came across this interesting report from 2004 covering the Scottish investment scene and it goes a long way to explain why Scotland is n't home to as many successful startups as it deserves .
Not much has changed in 4 years and to put some figures on it , we are apparently we are only working at 20 % of our economy 's potential :
Next time I have a decent idea , I 'm off down to London .
We have some of the brightest ideas in Scotland , some of the best graduates and even some of the world 's largest banks .
Yet we struggle at 20 % of our potential .
Why should I as an entrepreneur waste my time with a funding sector that is n't fit for purpose ?

The outbreak of violence in Tibet last week and the protests by Tibetan refugees in India have highlighted Delhi 's delicately - balanced policy of keeping China unruffled while respecting the rights of the Dalai Lama .
India has not allowed large - scale public protests
It is a tightrope walk at the best of times .
But when Tibetan anger is exploding around the world to protest Chinese policies , the Indian government 's job gets tougher in managing the anger of more than 150,000 refugees and their supporters .
The government arrested 100 Tibetans attempting to cross the border into China , earning words of appreciation from Premier Wen Jiabao .
It also arrested but quickly released some Delhi University students who tried to march to the Chinese Embassy , which remains secured by a thick police cordon .
' Solidarity and support '
India 's Foreign Minister Pranab Mukherjee expressed " distress " at the " unsettled situation and violence " in Tibet in parliament , while opposition members and some from the ruling Congress Party condemned the Chinese crackdown .
More than 45 members of the All Party Indian Parliamentary Forum for Tibet issued a strong statement expressing " solidarity and support to the Tibetans peacefully protesting inside Tibet " .
They asked the United Nations and the international community to send a special mission to Lhasa to investigate the situation and urged India to persuade the Chinese authorities to conduct " meaningful negotiations " .
But the Indian government 's official position is squarely that Tibet is an internal problem of China 's and any comment on how it should be resolved would be deemed as interference by Beijing .
The Dalai Lama maintains a government in exile in India
India 's relations with China have grown significantly in recent years , covering many more areas than the border question and the presence of the Dalai Lama on Indian soil .
China has emerged as India 's largest trading partner , with two - way trade crossing $ 38 billion , an increase of 56 % over the past year .
The world 's two fastest growing economies are enhancing their economic engagement at a rapid pace , despite little progress on the lingering border dispute .
Tourism too is on the rise with Indians travelling increasingly to newer destinations like China and other Asian countries .
The demands of the Indian business community and the tourists have added new policy compulsions , which were absent earlier , officials say .
Water concerns
India is also careful about stepping on Chinese toes because hundreds of thousands of its people depend on the River Brahmaputra , that originates in China .
There is concern that China is diverting water from the Brahmaputra to feed the Yellow River , an issue that India is trying address through a mechanism to share hydrological data .
Given the more complex relationship between two giant neighbours , the Indian government feels it has fewer levers to push as far as the Tibet issue is concerned .
India recognised Tibet as part of China way back in 1954 , before the Dalai Lama sought refuge in India along with his followers .
India 's first Prime Minister , Jawaharlal Nehru , granted the Dalai Lama asylum but on the condition the Tibetans would not engage in " subversive activities " against friendly countries .
The community maintains a government - in - exile in Dharamsala in northern India , which has come to be known as the Little Lhasa .
The two countries are becoming Asian and world superpowers
Indian officials stress that while India has treated the Dalai Lama with utmost respect , several western leaders have shied away from granting him a meeting on his travels .
The very fact that he lives in India is a " political act " which annoys the Chinese .
But critics say India 's policy is too cautious and borders on appeasement .
They say India could use the Tibet issue to its advantage , especially because China uses it repeatedly to its own advantage .
China claims the north - east Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh based on its ancient ecclesiastical links with Tibet .
While Indian members of parliament from the state are vocal against China , New Delhi remains shy of articulating anything that might ruffle Beijing 's feathers .
Kanwal Sibal , a former Indian foreign secretary , wrote recently that " Tibet is at the head of our border dispute with China " .
" It plays the Tibet card against us without compunction , " he said , " undeterred by the fact that its own position on Tibet is contested by the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan people . "
And , he concluded , " we let China patronise us . "

Some deaf activists contend they do not have a disability
For a long time , the debate about the genetic testing of embryos has focused on whether we should stop people creating the " perfect " person : blonde , blue - eyed , with athletic prowess and a high IQ .
The Nazi spectre of eugenics has frequently been invoked .
Now a deaf couple have turned this on its head : far from wanting a flawless child they actively want a baby which suffers the same hearing difficulties as they themselves .
The couple have become icons in a deaf movement which sees this impairment not as a disability but as the key to a rich culture which has its own language , history and traditions : a world deaf parents would naturally want to share with any offspring .
Moreover , they argue that to prefer a hearing embryo over a deaf one is tantamount to discrimination .
But to others - both those who can hear and those who cannot - deliberately bringing a child with a disability into the world when one without could be born verges on the morally repugnant .
Slippery slope ?
Tomato Lichy and his partner already have one deaf child , for which they are profoundly grateful .
Despite the fact that over time we have seen more and more rights for disabled people they are now seeking to establish a legal principle that deaf people are inferior
Tomato Lichy
But they may eventually like another - and IVF , given the mother 's age , may be the only option .
Yet if the Human Embryology and Fertilisation Bill goes through as it stands , their chances of having a deaf child would be small .
If they produced only deaf embryos , they would be allowed to implant one of these .
However it would be highly unlikely that there would not be one without one of the deaf genes .
If they chose to have their embryos screened , they would be obliged to to pick the embryo without the abnormality over the others .
The screening would not however be obligatory , and they could take their chances in the hope that a deaf one is chosen .
But the fact that they cannot give the deaf child preference over the hearing , Mr Lichy contends , suggests that his life as a deaf person is not one worth living .
HAVE YOUR SAY
How would the child react when they found out that their parents actively sought to deprive them of a sense ?
Martin , London
" The core issue is that the government is saying deaf people are not equal to hearing people , " he told the BBC via an interpreter .
" Despite the fact that over time we have seen more and more rights for disabled people they are now seeking to establish a legal principle that deaf people are inferior - and there may be more laws once this gap opens . "
What message does it send to their deaf daughter , he asks , whom later they will have to tell : " We had a deaf embryo but the government said we were not allowed to have it " .
Rich world
One of the beliefs he holds most dear is that deafness is any event not a disability .
It is certainly not a slight to the deaf to say it is better to bring a child who will face the least difficulty into the world , when there is a choice to be made
Jackie Ballard
RNID
From his perspective , the inability to hear is an integral part of his identity , and it is those who are able to hear who are at a disadvantage in a world of deaf plays , deaf poetry , and deaf jokes .
But his argument that he is not disabled is not one accepted by some of those who campaign on behalf of those who cannot hear .
The Royal National Institute for Deaf People does not support the choice of deaf embryos over those who would not be born with hearing problems .
" No - one should be forced into having genetic testing if they do n't want it .
But if they do , we would want the embryos without the gene to be implanted , " says its chief executive Jackie Ballard .
" Deafness is a disability and we have spent a long time campaigning to improve the lives of people who live with it .
But it is certainly not a slight to the deaf to say it is better to bring a child who will face the least difficulty into the world , when there is a choice to be made . "
Storm in a teacup ?
Only a tiny minority of deaf or hard - of - hearing people in the UK see themselves as part of a community with a distinct identity in the way that Mr Lichy sees himself .
Where someone has an inherited genetic condition but did not wish their embryos to be tested for it , they would not be obliged to do so
Department of Health
Moreover , the current , increasingly febrile debate is about an action which has never taken place in the UK and is based on a couple who have yet even to seek IVF treatment .
Research carried out at Leeds University found the vast majority of deaf people polled expressed no preference - and would be happy with either a deaf or a hearing child .
In addition , IVF births - which are those at issue - make up just 1 % of all deliveries in this country .
Combined with the tiny proportion of these parents who would be both deaf and strongly desire a child who could not hear , we may not even be looking at a case a decade , experts say .
" Given that we are looking at such at a very small number of people , I think we can afford to be quite liberal about this , " says Julian Savulescu , director of the Oxford Centre for Applied Ethics .
" Deafness is a disability , but it is not one that stops people having a life that 's worth living - and if there are a handful of people out there who want a deaf child , they can find a doctor who will help them , and they are prepared to pay for it , then so be it . "
But regardless of how rare it would be , the government is thought unlikely to change its mind on this particular clause .
If they do opt for IVF , Mr Lichy and his partner may end up with what they see as a " disabled " child : one that can hear .
Brad Pitt and Pax Go Four Wheeling ( Photos )
and sonwere captured on New Years Day riding an ATV in New Orleans .
It looks like they may be on the site of his home rebuilding project in the Lower 9th Ward - which is part of his .
Our only concern is that Pax is n't wearing a helmet .
Brad will undoubtedly take some flack .
We know the kids have helmets because we 've seen them when the family has been out on their bicycle treks through New Orleans .
We 've got more pictures of Brad , Angelina Jolie , and the rest of the family , taken during their extended stay in New Orleans .
The couple bought a home there last year and Pitt has donated a large sum of money and resources to help with the rebuilding process .
A male European starling sits on a statue and sings in San Francisco , with the Golden Gate Bridge in the background .
Pollution can actually lead male birds to change their tune , singing better than before .
This could lead to birds that prefer pollution , to their ultimate detriment .
Scientists focused on wild European starlings ( Sturnus vulgaris ) that were foraging for earthworms at a number of sewage treatment plants .
These areas were contaminated with pollutants that mimicked estrogen .
After determining what pollutants the birds were exposed to , behavioral ecologist Shai Markman at Cardiff University in Wales and his colleagues fed starlings mealworms that either were clean or were dosed with the same pollutants .
The researchers found the pollutants markedly enlarged the area of the brain that controls song complexity in the male birds .
The males sang more often and developed longer and more complex songs that females preferred .
[ 10 Things You Didn't Know About the Brain ]
" This is the first evidence that environmental pollutants not only affect , but paradoxically enhance a signal of male quality such as song , " said researcher Katherine Buchanan , a behavioral ecologist at Cardiff University .
Unfortunately , the pollutants also debilitated the birds , hampering their immune systems .
The concern now is that females will prefer males that sing well but are in poor shape .
" Our results suggest female birds should prefer to mate with males that forage on polluted prey , " Buchanan told LiveScience .
" That 's bad because we know the pollution affects immune function .
We do n't know whether it also affects their ability to find food for offspring , or their fertility .
The pollution could have dramatic effects on their population . "
[ 10 Swingers of the Animal Kingdom ]
" It 's extremely likely that a whole range of birds will be affected the same way , " Buchanan added .
" We know corvids — magpies and crows , for instance — use these sewage treatment plants as foraging places when food is in short supply . "
The effects of these pollutants on females remain uncertain .
" We could see hypermasculinazation of these females , with females starting to sing when normally they don't , " Buchanan said .
Markman , Buchanan and their colleagues detailed their findings Feb. 27 in the journal PLoS ONE .

La. Woman Admits to Attempting to Leave the Booking Room A woman says officer beat her after he turned off camera .
Feb. 20 , 2008  --
A handcuffed Louisiana woman who emerged from a police holding room with two black eyes and broken teeth said that after the arresting officer turned off a monitoring camera he slammed her against a wooden door and then against a metal locker .
Angela Garbarino also admitted that while the camera was off she tried to leave the room despite orders from Officer Wylie Willis to stay put .
Garbarino spoke to " Good Morning America " for the first time about what happened during those minutes that the camera was turned off .
" It was very painful , " she said .
" Officer Willis came over to me to the chair .
He threw me against the door .
He slammed me against that black file locker [ seen in the video ] . "
Garbarino , who described the incident as " a nightmare , " contends that Willis physically abused her , but Willis ' attorney said she was inebriated and disorderly .
" Although unfortunate , her injuries were caused by her own erratic behavior and her failure to comply with lawful , reasonable and standard instructions for persons under arrest , " said Willis ' attorney Eron Brainard in a statement to ABC News .
" Officer Willis was presented with an intoxicated and extremely belligerent female criminal suspect who had just been arrested by other officers for the highly dangerous offenses of Driving While Intoxicated . "
Though police and Garbarino agree the situation was uneasy , Garbarino said she was not so drunk she could n't recall the incident .
" I remember everything , " she said .
" I wanted to make a phone call and he would n't let me .
I repeatedly asked him why he would n't let me make a phone call .
He just ignored me . "
When pressed on whether she tried to leave the room , Garbarino paused and answered , " Yes . "
Garbarino said her injuries included two black eyes , two broken teeth and bruises on her arm and shoulder .
Her attorney Ron Miciotto said his client also suffered a broken nose and a severe cut on her forehead .
He added that once Willis turned the video camera back on , Garbarino could be seen lying on the floor in a pool of blood .
Viewers can see him checking his hands to see whether blood is on them , Miciotto said .
" On three occasions he looks down on his hands to see if there is any blood on his hands , " Miciotto said .
Authorities fired Willis after the incident and he is contesting his dismissal .
Willis may be bolstered by the support of his police union .
" What we find to be unreasonable was the behavior of the suspect from the point she came in the room , " said Shreveport police union president Michael Carter .
Willis and his attorney 's version of the account do n't mesh with Garbarino 's story of what happened .
" He followed training and standard procedures , but this suspect was out of control and repeatedly tried to leave the testing area , which forced him to have to restrain her .
After her refusal to take the breath test , Officer Willis turned off and saved the videotape , in accordance with normal practice .
The suspect again tried to leave the room .
In the process of stopping her , she fell and injured herself , " the statement continued .
What Happened on the Videotape
What makes Garbarino 's injuries and situation more curious is the fact that Shreveport police Willis turned off the interrogation - room camera after he and Garbarino exchanged words .
" The video can be turned off or on at any time , " Miciotto said of rules governing the recording of police bookings .
However , with a woman , " you would think you want the video running the whole time so that the whole story is told , " he added .
The video shows Garbarino requesting a phone call .
" You 're not going to let me call anybody ? " she asks on the video .
" I have a right to call somebody right now and I know that .
Is this on the record ? "
The footage documents Wiley attempting to read Garbarino her rights , but he runs out of patience and things get tense .
He seems to forcefully put her in a chair .
" Do n't touch me again .
Get away from me , " Garbarino says after a scream .
Then , Wiley walks over to the police camera recording the booking and turns it off .
What happens next is a mystery , but when the video resumes the handcuffed Garbarino is sprawled on the floor and silently lying in a pool of her blood .
Another officer arrives and takes a cursory look before Garbarino is wheeled out on a stretcher .
In addition to her bruised face , Garbarino 's injuries also included two broken teeth .
While Garbarino says
Wiley physically abused her , his attorney said what he did was " in accordance with normal practice . "
" The suspect again tried to leave the room .
In the process of stopping her , she fell and injured herself , " said Eron Brainard in a statement to ABC News .
Wiley is appealing his dismissal and police have not brought charges against him because no one knows for sure what occurred .
Meanwhile , Garbarino faces reckless driving , hit - and - run and DWI charges .
She has denied the charges .
A Shreveport police spokesperson said no specific law about the phone call exists , but typically suspects are processed , booked and then allowed to make a phone call .
But at least one expert said at the very least Wiley should have called for a female backup .
" I think we have a situation where the arrested person is refusing to cooperate and the police officer apparently overreacted , " said Tulane University forensic criminologist Wade S. Schindler .
The federal government has repeatedly pledged to encrypt sensitive information , not to mention stop the practice of storing it on employee laptops , in the wake of several serious security breaches .
But apparently it has yet to make good on its promises .
The U.S. National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) confirmed Monday that a laptop containing unsecured information about 2,500 participants enrolled in a cardiac study by its National Heart , Lung , and Blood Institute ( NHLBI ) was stolen from the trunk of a researcher 's car .
NHLBI director Elizabeth Nabel said in a statement that the theft did not occur on the NIH 's Bethesda , Md. , campus , but she did not provide any other details about the alleged crime .
She said the purloined computer was issued to an employee ( as opposed to a government contractor ) ; it reportedly contained the names , birth dates and hospital medical record numbers of each participant as well as information gleaned about them from cardiac MRIs taken during the study conducted from 2001 to 2007 .
The NHLBI Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) — an independent committee that oversees the conduct of research to protect the rights and welfare of study participants — decided on March 4 that study participants should be informed of the breach , but the panel did not approve a letter to be sent to them until March 20 .
( They were sent via overnight delivery the following day . )
The NHLBI said it " immediately " reported the theft to Montgomery County , Md. , police .
The NHLBI did not respond to phone or e-mail requests for comment , but The Washington Post reported that the laptop was stolen February 23 .
Federal organizations supported by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services ( which administers the NIH ) that conduct research on humans are required to have an IRB consisting of at least five members with varied backgrounds ( both in science and other disciplines ) review their work .
NHLBI conducts research designed to get to the bottom of heart , blood vessel , lung and blood diseases as well as sleep disorders .
It is only one of several government agencies that have had sensitive — and unencrypted — information stolen over the past two years ; others include the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs ( VA ) ( which in May 2006 had a laptop containing the personal information of 26.5 million veterans and their spouses stolen from an employee 's apartment ) ; the U.S. Department of Transportation ( victim of a July 2006 theft from a special agent 's car in Doral , Fla. , of a laptop containing Social Security numbers and other personal information on some 133,000 Florida residents ) ; and the Internal Revenue Service , which in June 2006 lost a laptop containing information on 291 employees and job applicants , including fingerprints , names , Social Security numbers and birth dates .
The private sector has not fared much better .
During the same period , several major corporations including Fidelity Investments and General Electric reported similar security breaches that put as many as 250,000 people at risk for identity theft and financial fraud .
NHLBI clearly did not follow recommendations made by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology ( NIST ) in June 2006 that government departments and agencies encrypt all data on mobile computers and devices unless the information was deemed " nonsensitive " in writing by the department or agency head .
Compliance was voluntary , but the White House Office of Management and Budget the following month issued a memorandum requiring agencies to report all thefts or loss of personally identifiable information to the U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team ( U.S. –CERT ) within an hour of discovering such an incident .
U.S–CERT was established in 2003 to protect the nation 's Internet infrastructure , coordinating defense against and responses to cyber attacks .
In the VA burglary , after the government learned of the crime more than three weeks had elapsed before it notified the public .
The VA was informed on May 3 but did not tell affected veterans until the end of the month .
Nor did the VA act quickly enough to enforce encryption policies .
A few months later , another VA laptop was stolen from the Reston , Va. , offices of government contractor Unisys Corporation .
That computer contained thousands of unsecured records of VA patients that had been treated in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh medical facilities .
Nabel says the stolen NHLBI laptop was turned off and password protected , likely limiting the potential fallout .
But she acknowledged that such information should not have been stored in unencrypted form on a laptop .
" When volunteers enroll in a clinical study , they place great trust in the researchers and study staff , expecting them to act both responsibly and ethically , " she said in the statement .
" We at the NHLBI take that trust very seriously and we deeply regret that this incident may cause those who have participated in one of our studies to feel that we have violated that trust . "
Nabel also said the NIH's Center for Information Technology ( CIT ) staff determined that it is unlikely that study participants ' information was specifically targeted for theft .
CIT agreed that the incident poses a " low likelihood of identity theft or financial implications . "
With a healthy demand on the Internet for stolen personal information that can be bought and sold to commit fraud , only time will tell if the government 's assessment is accurate , or simply wishful thinking .
Clinton camp targets Obama adviser saying neither candidate ready for 3 a.m. call David Edwards and Nick Juliano
Published : Thursday March 6 , 2008

Print This Email This Hillary Clinton's and Barack Obama 's campaigns continued to battle Thursday over national security credentials with Clinton attempting to pin a damaging " You Tube moment " on its opponent .
Clinton distributed a clip of Obama adviser Susan Rice arguing that neither candidate would be ready for the type of 3 a.m. phone call Clinton portrayed in a recent ad .
A cable host asked when Obama had been in the position to handle a similar crisis .
" He has n't .
And he has n't claimed that he 's been in a position to have to answer the phone at three o'clock in the morning in a crisis situation , " Rice said on MSNBC Wednesday night .
" That 's the difference between the two of them .
Hillary Clinton has n't had to answer the phone at three o'clock in the morning , and yet she attacked Barack Obama for not being ready .
They 're both not ready to have that phone call . "
She went on to echo the Obama campaign 's contention that he would exercise better judgement in a crisis than Clinton , who voted in favor of the resolution that authorized the war in Iraq .
The New York Times reported that Clinton 's campaign was distributing an edited clip of the exchange .
And Clinton advisers noted Rice 's comments in a memo sent to reporters Thursday afternoon .
" With one of his top foreign policy advisers acknowledging yesterday that he is not ready to take the 3 am call ...
Senator Obamas time would be better spent making the case for why he can do the most important job in the world just three years out of the state senate , " read the campaign release .
With John McCain securing the Republican presidential nomination , national security and terror fears are likely going to remain on voters ' minds through November .
Both Democrats are trying to convince their party 's voters that they would be better suited to challenge the Vietnam War veteran on these issues .
Rice has previously argued that Obama would have more foreign policy experience when he is sworn in than did President Bush or former Presidents Bill Clinton , Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Cater .
Hillary Clinton 's phone call ad was seen by some as inadvertently aiding McCain by questioning Obama 's experience .
Some say Rice 's comments similarly aided the GOP nominee .
" Did John McCain say that ? "
Commentary magazine 's Jennifer Rubin asked about Rice 's comment .
" Nope . Susan Rice , a top Barack Obama advisor .
That fundamentally is the problem with the Clinton attack and Obamas counterattack . "
Foreign Policy dubbed Rice the " Worst foreign - policy spokesperson ever . "
On a conference call earlier Thursday , Clinton spokesman Howard Wolfson accused Obama 's campaign of relying on negative attacks -- mostly accusing Clinton of having something to hide by not releasing her tax returns -- in the wake of questions over his security credentials .
It created an odd dynamic after a week of calls leading up to Tuesday 's primary during which Clinton advisers launched similar attacks at Obama , raising questions about his relationship with Tony Rezko .
" When Sen . Obama was confronted with questions over whether he was ready to be commander in chief or steward of the economy , he chose not to address those questions and instead to attack Sen. Clinton , " Wolfson said .
" And I do not think that imitating Ken Star is the way to win a Democratic primary election for president , but perhaps that theory will be tested . "
Obama 's top spokesman , Bill Burton , fired back in an e-mail to reporters : " It is absurd that after weeks of badgering the media to vet  Senator Obama , the Clinton campaign believes that they should be held to an entirely different standard .
We dont believe that expecting candidates for the presidency to disclose their tax returns somehow constitutes Ken Starr - tactics , but the kind of transparency and accountability that Americans are looking for and that s been missing in Washington for far too long .
And if Senator Clinton doesnt think that the Republicans will ask these very same questions , then shes not as ready to go toe - to - toe with John McCain as she claims , " he said .
Obama 's camp later pointed to this reminder that Clinton 's campaign , and Wolfson in particular , seemed to be making precisely the opposite argument about releasing its tax returns as it did in 2000 , when Clinton 's campaign for Senate in New York made her opponent 's failure to release his returns an issue .
Wolfson said 20 years of Clinton 's tax returns had been released , and he promised that the former First Lady 's post -2001 returns would be made public " on or about April 15 . "
He promised their release would come before Pennsylvania 's primary a week later .

Some of us progressives have comforted ourselves that after the Bush administration is over , the history books will finally tell the truth .
Not so fast .
History News Network ( George Mason Univ . ) :
The Bush administration ’s Executive Order 13233 underscores the new fact that presidential legacies , once the domain of academic historians and parlor game aficionados , have become a serious business — so much so that a president has mounted a Kremlinesque campaign to stifle the free dissemination of information .
The Bush administration is playing for keeps .
Bush ’s Executive Order 13233 could change history — literally — by restricting historians ’ access to materials that help them document and ultimately judge a president ’s actions , lapses , and principles .
Executive Order 13233 gives ex-presidents nearly unlimited discretionary authority to prohibit the release of their papers , and allows them to name designees who can act in their stead .
Moreover , a sitting president may also prevent the release of a predecessor ’s papers — as Bush has already done with some of Ronald Reagan ’s papers — even when the predecessor has authorized his papers ’ release .
These are radical encroachments on the public ’s access to documents that were produced in the public interest , at public expense , by officials elected by the public .
Citizens can challenge these decisions in court , but the expense and time commitment will discourage most people from trying .
A House - approved bill that would undo this blatant assault on openness has been held up in the Senate .
Even if the measure advances , there is no guarantee that Congress could override Bush ’s expected veto .
First of all , I ’ve got to say that I agree wholeheartedly with Stephen ’s sentiments , expressed here and here , that Elliot Spitzer pretty much deserved everything that has , and will , come to him .
During his time as Attorney General of New York , he was a no-holds - barred zealous prosecutor that cared little for the facts or for the lives that he ruined .
He was , as someone mentioned on the radio today , what Mike Nifong would have been like if he ’d been something much more powerful than a North Carolina District Attorney .
If nothing else , this scandal removes the possibility that he will ever by Attorney General of the United States , or , God forbid , President — positions for which his name was mentioned up until Monday , March 10th .
That said , there are a few things about this case that should have libertarians thinking twice .
The first , as Megan McArdle points out , is that relic of the 19th Century , the Mann Act .
That law makes it a federal offense to transport someone across state lines for “ immoral purposes ” and it is one of the several potential Federal crimes that Spitzer could be charged with .
Throughout it ’s history , the Mann Act was used in a discriminatory manner .
More importantly , though , it ’s simply outdated and beyond the scope of powers granted to Congress under the Constitution .
The second lesson involves the manner in which Spitzer ’s use of prostitutes was uncovered :
Last July , the North Fork Bank raised a red flag about suspicious financial transactions involving Gov. Eliot Spitzer .
But for several months , the electronic report languished unnoticed in a vast Treasury Department database in Detroit .
In early fall , however , a separate report was filed by the HSBC bank about suspicious transactions connected to two shell companies , which drew the attention of investigators .
That touched off an inquiry that led investigators to discover the July report on Mr. Spitzer , which showed he had made several wire transfers to those companies , according to three people briefed on the inquiry .
(…)
Following the bank ’s alert , agents for the Internal Revenue Service in Hauppauge , on Long Island , began examining the shell companies , which are allegedly connected to a Web - based prostitution service named Emperor ’s Club V.I.P .
At that time , the agents had no idea how the QAT front companies had collected hundreds of thousands of dollars in revenue .
“ They still did n’t know what the business was , and they started digging into the account — is it drugs , money laundering ? ” said one of the people briefed on the inquiry .
“ They then start to see money from Spitzer . ”
In other words , the fact that the Governor of New York was uncovered because of reporting requirements placed on banks as part of War on ( Some ) Drugs and the War on Terror which are purportedly aimed at uncovering money laundering , suspicious cash transfers , and illegal payments :
As part of the “ know your customer ” requirements , banks must assess their clients ’ financial patterns and set guidelines to ensure that an alarm is sounded if there are unusual transactions , said Bob Serino , a former deputy chief counsel at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency who now advises banks and individuals on anti-money laundering regulations .
(…)
Once a bank determines that a transaction is suspicious , it is obligated to file a Suspicious Activity Report with FinCEN , the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network , a division of the Treasury Department .
The standard for filing such reports has diminished since 9/11 , with banks erring on the side of caution out of fear that the government will later second - guess its decisions , experts said .
Whether you like it or not , your bank has become an agent of the state and is monitoring your deposits and withdrawals for “ suspicious ” activity , whatever that might be .
As Jack Balkin notes , there is good reason to be concerned about this :
If computing power increases enough , there is no reason why governments might not lower the threshold for reporting of suspicious transactions , or , indeed , require that every transaction over 100 dollars be reported .
All this information could later be sifted through by data mining programs , in order to spot patterns of suspicious activity .
The only limit is the technology and the manpower that law enforcement is willing to devote to analysis of financial transactions .
The Spitzer story shows both the promise and the threat of these developments .
On the one hand , reporting financial transactions makes the job of law enforcement easier , and it uncovers crimes ( and terrorist plots ) that might never be discovered otherwise .
Mandatory disclosure ( or in this case , voluntary disclosure by banks ) of private individual ’s financial transactions , and sharing of data between intelligence services , federal , state and local law enforcement helps the state identify patterns of criminal activity , prevent crimes before they occur , and punish them after the fact .
These techniques and technologies allow governments to do the jobs entrusted to them more powerfully and more efficiently than ever before .
On the other hand , these developments carry all of the potential risks of a powerful National Surveillance State : Governments can make mistakes in assessing levels of criminality and dangerousness ; and their data mining models may characterize innocent activity as suspicious .
Without sufficient oversight and checking functions , government actors may misuse the additional knowledge they gain , for example , by instigating abusive prosecutions , or creating discriminatory systems for access to public and private services ( like banks , airports , government entitlements and so on ) .
And the more powerful government becomes in knowing what its citizens are doing , the easier it becomes for government to control people ’s behavior .
It may not be 1984 , but Big Brother is watching .
A new study ( large PDF ) from the Institute for Policy Innovation takes a different approach to quantifying the cost of music piracy .
Instead of just focusing on what the lost sales cost the record labels , the new study measures the impact of piracy on the US economy .
The total price tag ?
A cool $ 12.5 billion in lost output , if you trust the study 's numbers .
Along with the multibillion - dollar loss , piracy also is hindering job growth , according to the IPI .
The US economy will lose 71,060 jobs due to piracy , with almost 38 percent of those ( 26,860 ) in the recording industry .
That amounts to $ 2.7 billion in lost earnings .
Piracy also hits Uncle Sam — as well as state and local governments — right in the pocketbook , with at least $ 422 million in lost tax revenues .
Problematic assumptions
The study makes for some alarming reading , but it suffers from a few significant flaws .
First and foremost , it appears to fall into the " illicit downloads == lost sales " fallacy , the view that each song obtained over a P2P network is a lost purchase .
" Unfortunately , there is no precise measure of the degree to which consumers of pirated CDs would continue to purchase those CDs at legitimate prices , " according to the study .
" While the degree to which these legitimate purchases would occur differs by market , it appears nevertheless that such purchases would comprise a very significant fraction of the total number of pirated CDs now purchased ...
In this study , the weighted average substitution rate used for the physical piracy of recorded music is 65.7 percent .
It is then assumed that only 20 % ( 1 in 5 ) of these downloaded songs would have been purchased legitimately if piracy did not exist . "
That 's a bit better than the one - to - one argument , but not by much .
It essentially assumes that one of every five downloaded songs would have been purchased , were it not for file - sharing .
Although a 20 percent figure may not look like much , it is still a percentage not justified by our own knowledge of file - sharing trends .
The study needs to make a firm argument for why this percentage is so high .
It 's a flaw similar to that in a 2006 study commissioned by the MPAA .
Note that the assumption cuts both ways .
Not only does it assume many would - be sales , but it also ignores sales that do stem from file - sharing .
P2P users buy a lot of music , after all .
Three out of four P2P users said that they bought music after downloading it online , with 21 percent of the respondents to the survey commissioned by the Canadian Record Industry Association saying that they have bought previously downloaded music on more than 10 occasions .
So here again , we have data which would necessarily lower the study 's estimates not being taken into account .
Another study even goes so far as to argue that the effect of file - sharing on legal music sales is " not statistically distinguishable from zero . "
Published this past February in the Journal of Political Economy , the study tracked the effects of 1.75 million song downloads on 680 albums .
The researchers concluded that the availability — and even increased downloads — of music on P2P networks did not correlate to a negative effect on music sales .
" Even our most negative point estimate implies that a one - standard - deviation increase in file - sharing reduces an album 's weekly sales by a mere 368 copies , an effect that is too small to be statistically distinguishable from zero , " the study 's authors reported .
If there was no such thing as piracy ...
The IPI study also assesses the increased demand for music if piracy did n't exist and assumes the market would remain as " intensely competitive " as it is today .
The problem is that music fans are largely disenchanted with the market .
By and large , music fans think that music is too expensive and that much of what is available is n't very good .
58 percent of those responding to a study commissioned by Rolling Stone magazine and the Associated Press said that music is declining in quality .
And although the DRM situation is looking up these days , it can still be a confusing morass with unanticipated side effects for consumers , as the recently announced closure of the Google Video Store demonstrates .
Consumer apathy aside , there are other factors at work in the music industry .
One of the biggest is the transition from sales of physical media to digital media .
CD sales have dropped sharply since the beginning of the decade , and projections indicate that there 's no end in sight to the decline .
Sure , downloads have picked up since 2004 , but not at a rate that will come close to overcoming the slide in CD sales .
The individual song download angle is largely ignored by the IPI 's study as well , which is fixated on sales of physical media .
The IPI has a history of pushing what it calls a pro-market agenda with its research , including one study asking if open source has reached its limits and another similar to that under discussion here that attempts to quantify the economic impact of movie piracy .
Given its track record ( which includes this gem from the aforementioned open - source study : " Open source will go the way of other IT industry fads that were once trumpeted as the way of the future , like Macintosh computers , business AI , 4GL programming languages and Y2K " ) and ideological bent , the results of this study are rather unsurprising .
When the discussion over dollar figures and economic impact comes to an end , most people will agree that file - sharing is a real issue for the recording industry and that there is a financial cost that goes along with it .
It 's also true that piracy has something of a ripple effect , reaching beyond the artists and record labels .
But studies that overstate the economic effect of piracy do little to further the discussion over issues of copyright , file - sharing , and DRM , and they obscure the fact that the music industry still has some serious work to do on its business model .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- President Bush expressed sympathy Monday for the families of the 4,000 Americans killed in the war in Iraq , promising to make sure their loved ones " were not lost in vain . "
President Bush addresses the press Monday with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice .
" One day , people will look back at this moment in history and say , ' Thank God there were courageous people willing to serve , because they laid the foundations for peace for generations to come , ' " Bush told reporters after a meeting at the State Department .
Military officials reported four U.S. soldiers died Sunday in a roadside bombing in Iraq , bringing the American toll in the war to the milestone of 4,000 deaths , including eight Defense Department civilians .
The war entered its six year last week .
Watch more of Bush 's remarks »
Of the 4,000 U.S. military personnel killed in the war , 3,263 have been killed in attacks and fighting and 737 in nonhostile incidents , such as traffic accidents and suicides .
The numbers are based on Pentagon data counted by CNN .
During a briefing with reporters Monday , White House press secretary Dana Perino said the president " definitely feels the loss . "
" He gets a report about every single soldier who passes away , " she said .
" And he always pauses a moment to think about them and to offer a prayer for their loved ones and their family and friends . "
Bush also held a two - hour National Security Council videoconference Monday with his top commander in Iraq , Gen. David Petraeus , and Ryan Crocker , the U.S. ambassador in Baghdad .
Perino said the meeting focused on upcoming congressional testimony from Petraeus and Crocker , scheduled for April 8 and 9 .
In Baghdad , a U.S. military spokesman said every death is " keenly felt " by American commanders , families and friends .
" No casualty is more or less significant than another ; each soldier , Marine , airman and sailor is equally precious and their loss equally tragic , " Rear Adm. Gregory Smith said .
In a statement issued Monday , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the continued cost of the war in blood and treasure has become " unacceptable . "
" With 4,000 American lives lost and thousands injured , many of them permanently , Americans are asking how much longer must our troops continue to sacrifice for the sake of an Iraqi government that is unwilling or unable to secure its own future , " said Pelosi , D - California .
Earlier in the day , the Democratic presidential candidates commented on the death toll reaching 4,000 .
" I want to take a moment to note yesterday 's heartbreaking news that five years after the start of the war , there have been 4,000 U.S. military deaths in Iraq , " Sen .
Hillary Clinton said at the start of a speech on the economy in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , on Monday .
" Tens of thousands of our brave men and women have also suffered serious wounds , both visible and invisible , to their bodies , their minds and their hearts .
As president , I intend to honor their extraordinary service and the sacrifice of them and their families by ending this war and bringing them home as quickly and responsibly as possible , " she said .
Watch Sens. Clinton and John McCain comment on Iraq »
Her rival for the Democratic nomination , Sen. Barack Obama , also commented on the the " grim " milestone , saying " each death is a tragedy , and we honor every fallen American and send our thoughts and prayers to their families . "
" It is past time to end this war that should never have been waged by bringing our troops home , and finally pushing Iraq 's leaders to take responsibility for their future , " he said .
Republican candidate Sen. John McCain recently returned from the Mideast .
" The central battleground in the battle against al Qaeda is in Iraq today , " McCain said , noting a message allegedly released by Osama bin Laden last week calling Iraq ' a perfect base . '
" My Democrat opponents who want to pull out of Iraq refuse to understand what 's being said and what 's happening , and that is , the central battleground is Iraq in this struggle against radical Islamic extremism , " McCain said .

All About Iraq War • George W. Bush • Barack Obama • Hillary Clinton
Yesterday we reported on AT&T 's controversial Terms of Service , which in broad legal language gives AT&T the right to terminate a customer 's service for activity which AT&T deems " damaging " to its reputation .
As we noted yesterday , the legal language is particularly vague and appears to give AT&T broad discretion in deciding what constitutes " damage . "
To recap , in section 5 of its legal ToS , AT&T stipulates the following :
AT&T may immediately terminate or suspend all or a portion of your Service , any Member ID , electronic mail address , IP address , Universal Resource Locator or domain name used by you , without notice , for conduct that AT&T believes ( a ) violates the Acceptable Use Policy ; ( b ) constitutes a violation of any law , regulation or tariff ( including , without limitation , copyright and intellectual property laws ) or a violation of these TOS , or any applicable policies or guidelines , or ( c ) tends to damage the name or reputation of AT&T , or its parents , affiliates and subsidiaries .
Translation : " conduct " that AT&T " believes " " tends to damage " its name , or the name of its partners , can get you booted off the service .
Note the use of " tends to damage " : the language of the contract does not require any proof of any actual damage .
Interpretation of this section of the ToS has been practically unanimous online : it gives AT&T the power to punish customers that dare criticize the company .
However , an AT&T spokesperson tells Ars Technica that the company has no interest in engaging in censorship but stopped short of saying that AT&T could not in fact exercise its ability to do so .
" AT&T respects its subscribers ' rights to voice their opinions and concerns over any matter they wish .
However , we retain the right to disassociate ourselves from web sites and messages explicitly advocating violence , or any message that poses a threat to children ( e.g. child pornography or exploitation ) , " the spokesperson told Ars Technica .
" We do not terminate customer service solely because a customer speaks negatively about AT&T . "
The language of the contract reflects synchronization between the AT&T Yahoo !
High Speed Internet Terms of Service with the Terms of Service for AT&T's Worldnet and BellSouth customers .
AT&T says that the language is not new , nor is such language unique to AT&T 's contracts .
It does appear to be here to stay .
Some readers who learned of the updated Terms of Service were upset by them , but not surprised .
A reader drew connections to AT&T 's involvement in the recent domestic spying scandal .
" Given the fact that AT&T does n't seem to have been hurt much with the spying case , I really do n't think they will be hurt much if they cut off people that criticize them , " wrote one reader .
Customers will have to take AT&T's word on faith , for the language of the contract is far broader than the spirit of its intent , as described by the AT&T spokesperson .
However , as I noted yesterday , AT&T is clearly aware that using the ToS for censorship could cause considerable uproar .
It 's a cliché , but only time will tell if AT&T sticks to its word .
WE'VE MOVED !

The popularity of broadband services is helping online sales
Some £ 4.5 bn was spent last month , a 75 % rise compared with January last year , said industry body the Interactive Media in Retail Group ( IMRG ) .
Sales were dominated by electrical goods and clothes , which each saw a year - on - year rise of about a third .
But the amount spent fell from the record level seen during the pre-Christmas rush in December .
The equivalent of £ 74 for every person in the UK was spent online in January , the IMRG Capgemini e-Retail Sales Index found .
Bumper sales
" The index shows that January sales are as large a phenomenon online as they are on the high street , with the overall online market continuing to show strong growth , " said Anthoula Madden , vice - president at Capgemini UK 's consumer products and retail team .
" The high growth in electricals and clothing suggests that much of this spending is being driven by shoppers treating themselves to the items missing from their Christmas stockings . "
The growth in sales volume over the last three months was more than double that of the same period last year .
It was at the highest level since January 2003 , the index based on about 60 online retailers found .
Sales from the electrical sector in January 2007 rose by 38 % compared with the same month last year , while clothing was up by 32 % , health and beauty by 18 % , and beers , wines and spirits by 9.8 % .
Bargain drive
In separate research , consumer group Which ?
found that high - value purchases could often be found cheaper online .
Which ?
found savings were available for cars bought online
Its survey of internet car brokers found average savings of 11 % on the list prices of 15 new cars .
Researchers said they found the going tough , claiming sales staff were often unprofessional and inefficient .
But they found savings of £ 2,994 on the list price of a Mercedes C-class , while the Renault Clio 1.5 supermini was £ 2,550 cheaper online .
Richard Headland , editor of Which ?
Car , said : " We found that shopping around online is simpler than negotiating with dealers yourself and , in most cases , we obtained a better price .
" Buying through a broker also means you do n't have to haggle with pushy salesman .
But if you choose to buy from a main dealer , an internet quote can give you the upper hand . "
Authority to conduct warrantless electronic surveillance comes from the Constitution and is vital to stopping foreign terrorist attacks and spies , says a Republican staff assessment of the revised Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act .
“ There is nothing new or aggressive about relying on Article II authority in the context of foreign intelligence surveillance , ” stated the assessment produced by the office of Sen. Christopher S. Bond , Missouri Republican and vice chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence .
The 13 - page assessment counters Democrats and other critics of the Terrorist Surveillance Program ( TSP ) who argued during a Senate filibuster of the legislation last month that electronic spying is illegal , began before the September 11 attacks , and that the program spied improperly on domestic telephone and electronic communications .
“ There is no evidence to substantiate claims about warrantless spying on Americans prior to the 9/11 terrorist attacks , ” the report stated .
“ Nor is there any evidence to substantiate the claim that the TSP covered domestic calls between friends , neighbors and loved ones .
As the president has stated , the TSP involved the collection of international calls involving members of al Qaeda . ”
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy , Massachusetts Democrat , said during the floor debate last month that the surveillance program spied on innocent Americans .
Sen. Christopher J. Dodd , Connecticut Democrat , also said then that any surveillance without a court order undermines “ our democratic society . ”
But the report stated that “ warrantless surveillance for foreign intelligence collection has been an integral part of our nation ’s foreign intelligence gathering .
During World War II , our warrantless surveillance of the German and Japanese militaries and the breaking of their codes preserved our democracy . ”
The Senate is expected to take up legislation as early as tomorrow on extending legislation governing electronic surveillance aimed at stopping foreign terrorists and spies .
A law passed in August , the Protect America Act , revised the 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Act procedures to better deal with modern communications and technology .
That law will expire at the end of this month .
“ Congress will have only eight days to pass a fix before our foreign intelligence surveillance law expires , ” Mr. Bond , ranking member of the Senate intelligence committee , told The Washington Times .
“ To continue to stall legislation needed to help our intelligence community prevent attacks and protect American lives is irresponsible . ”
The staff report said critics of the surveillance program claim it should have been carried out under FISA rules .
However , it stated that a decision by a surveillance court judge last year “ proved that the TSP could not be done under FISA as it existed at that time . ”
“ This decision resulted in significant intelligence gaps and led to the need for , and passage of , the Protect America Act , ” the report said .
The report said negative comments about the Justice Department ’s legal basis for surveillance program by some senators was used to argue against legislation giving private telecommunications companies that support intelligence surveillance needed legal protection from lawsuits .
“ I have reviewed the opinions and found them soundly reasoned , ” Mr. Bond said in the report , noting that because of the highly sensitive sources and methods , the Justice legal opinions are classified and their contents cannot be discussed publicly .
Democratic critics also have said the FISA law is the only permitted basis for conducting electronic surveillance , but the report stated that the Constitution “ trumps any statute . ”
“ It is false to suggest that the president has no inherent constitutional authority to conduct warrantless surveillance for foreign intelligence purposes because Congress tried to limit it in FISA , ” the report stated .

Daily
Show uses strongarm polling tactics to ensure results

In the aftermath of Super Tuesday , questions have been raised about the unreliability of the pre-election polls , leading Jon Stewart to wonder , " Can these polls be made to be more reliable ? "
In pursuit of the answer , the Daily Show 's John Oliver asked pollster Neil Newhouse , " So , after you 've done all that hard work , how is it that I still end up looking like a god - damned idiot on national tv ? "
" Polls are a snapshot in time of people 's attitudes , " Newhouse replied defensively .
" It 's not meant to be predictive . "
" I 'm going to put my own polling team together , " proclaimed Oliver , " and we 're going to crush you ! "
" This Super Tuesday , I 'd make sure that the numbers came out right , " Oliver explained in a voice - over .
" We do n't ask for Super Tuesday results , we take them ! "
Five Daily
Show correspondents then unleashed a reign of terror in midtown Manhattan , leaping out at innocent passersby to demand that they say who they intended to vote for and promising vengeance if they did n't stick by their statements .
Rob Riggle threatened one interviewee , " If you change your mind , it 'll be the worst mistake you ever made in your entire fucking life . "
Samantha
Bee pursued another across an intersection , yelling , " Come back here .
I 'm pregnant .
Jesus . "
" If you change your mind , I will find you and I will kill you , " John Oliver told a third , but he lacked Riggle 's self - assurance and took to his heels when the man coolly replied , " I might have to take you up on that offer . "
When the pollsters met back in the studio after Super Tuesday , Jon Stewart pointed out to them that their numbers still were n't accurate .
" You 're saying that someone lied to us ? " asked Oliver in amazement .
" Who would say a thing like that ? "
The camera then panned around the audience , zooming in on an apprehensive - looking man who was easily identifiable as one of the interviewees .
" You , right there ! " screamed Rob Riggle .
" You die tonight motherfucker . "
This video is from Comedy Central 's A Daily Show , broadcast February 6 , 2008 .
It ’s like they ’re not even trying to hide it anymore .
This is from the current front page of their website advertising a “ Focus On Safety ” Symposium in Florida back in October :
Take a closer look at the three “ hosts ” : ACS , Redflex , and Nestor Traffic Systems .
Those are three of the biggest red - light ticket camera corporations in the country .
The National Campaign to Stop Red Light Running positions itself as a public safety organization when in fact it ’s funded by ticket camera corporations and run by a public relations firm in their employ .
This is an organization that has spearheaded the push for red - light cameras across the country .
This is an organization that stands side - by - side with legislators at their press conferences .
This is an organization that is frequently quoted as an unbiased source by the media .
It ’s clear to anyone who digs a little deeper that The National Campaign to Stop Red Light Running is a sham organization that functions as a lobbying arm for the ticket camera industry .
Spread the word .
How many times have you heard someone say , “ Hindsight is always 20/20 ” ?
If you are like me , you hear it a lot and think it a lot more .
Last year Jay wrote an article listing things he wished he ’d known earlier .
It got me thinking that the most crucial lessons in life and success are n’t taught in books or written on blogs , but they are found by living life itself .
Sure , there may be nuggets of wisdom that we pick up from Dumb Little Man , Zen Habits , or Life Remix , but it is up to us individually to act upon them and learn the lessons .
If it takes a failure for us to learn something important , so be it .
Here are 20 things that I personally came to understand and believe in .
Your 20 could be totally different .
Perhaps you only have 5 , it does n’t matter .
The key is that you learn from your life , your failures and your successes .
Neglect any one of those and you are taking a rocky road to learning and personal development .
You must create and look for opportunities :
Opportunities rarely ever come knocking on the door of someone who ’s not seeking them .
You have to create and seek opportunities for yourself .
You have to take the initiative to get the ball rolling and the doors opening .
Negativity will only bring more of it :
When you focus only on negativity , obviously that ’s all you will see .
You will not seek out positivity , and even when positivity comes into your life , you ’ll look for the negative part of it .
Where you are does not determine where you can go :
It does n’t matter if you ’re homeless or living in a mansion , poor or rich , or if you have a 4.0 grade point average or “ failing ” , it wo n’t make any difference in the future .
There are countless rags to riches stories to back this point up .
If you have the drive and talents , you can go anywhere .
You create your own limitations and horizon .
If you ca n’t help others , you ca n’t help yourself :
Even if it ’s just to hold the door for someone or some other simple gesture , it will do wonders for your life .
You ’ll feel great and you ’ll eventually be returned the favor sometime during your life , whether you realize it or not .
If you do n’t want to help others , then others wo n’t want to help you , and nor should they .
Follow your passion , money will follow :
If you have passion and have fun doing your job , then I would n’t consider it a job .
You can focus on creating even more passion for that subject and money will eventually follow you .
If you focus only on the money , it wo n’t come because you ’re focused on the quantity of your work and not the quality .
Enjoy yourself :
Have fun as much as possible , do n’t take everything so seriously .
Push your worries aside and bring enjoyment closer .
If it were easy everyone would do it :
This is why get rich quick schemes will never be true .
If it was so quick and easy then everyone would be millionaires .
Making money and accomplishing tasks is hard work , but well worth it .
Planning is good but so is being spontaneous :
Planning ahead in business and in life is important but so is being able to quickly change that plan .
Various people and events will get in the way of your plans , so you have to be able to modify or forget your plans at times .
Be spontaneous once and awhile , it makes life interesting .
You have many talents :
You may be a talented athlete or musician but you probably have ten more talents you do n’t even know about .
When people find something they ’re good at , they only focus on that instead of seeing what else they can do .
Do n’t work hard without rewards :
What ’s the point of working hard to follow your dreams if you are n’t going to treat yourself along the way .
Each little or big goal you accomplish should be rewarded with a proportionate treat , maybe a day off or a big slice of cake .
Money does bring happiness :
As I said , you should n’t be chasing money but when you do earn it , you know you ’ve been accomplishing something .
It feels great and brings you happiness because you know you ’ll have more freedom and time to do what you want .
Someone always has it worse :
At times you may be having a bad day , but stop yourself and think about it ; there has to be millions of other people are having a worse day than you .
You ’ll need others :
Make as many friends as you possibly can and never burn bridges .
You will need others for your success .
Being open - minded is the key to more knowledge :
If you want to know more about the world you have to be open - minded .
Give everything a chance .
Failure is great :
One of the most important , if not the most important steps to success is failure .
You have to fail at least once , but it ’s better if you ’ve failed multiple times .
You can learn so much more from your failures than you could any other way .
And when you finally achieve success , you ’ll appreciate it so much more .
Most people are actually nice :
This is something I ’ve only recently realized .
Most people are nice , but not usually to strangers .
Once they get to know you and you get to know them , they will most likely seem like very nice people .
Words and thoughts control everything : What you say and think will ultimately become reality .
If you say you ’re going to fail , then you will because you ’ll find a way to make it happen .
If you say you ’re going to succeed , the same will happen , you ’ll find a way .
Your view is the reality :
How you see an event or situation is how it exists .
If you see something as tragic and negative then that ’s what it means to you .
If you see something as exciting and positive , then that ’s what it is .
Inspiration and motivation are everywhere : I do n’t care where you are , there is something there that can motivate and inspire you .
You can be at war is some far away country , in horrible conditions , but there will be something there to keep you going and strive for something better .
You just have to recognize it and keep it with you .
You can change the world : Every single person has the ability to change the world whether directly or indirectly .
When you change your life and the lives of those around you , you ’ve changed the world .
Small things that you do can make a huge impact on the world .

Just months after Sony hauled its RPTV production business off to the graveyard , the firm is now bidding a fond farewell to the Trinitron CRT .
Believe it or not , the first Trinitron became a reality in 1968 , and here we are some 40 years later shedding a tear as LCDs and OLED displays steal the thunder .
Reportedly , the firm has moved some 280 million units worldwide between televisions and computer monitors , but we suppose all good things must eventually come to an end .
So long , Trinitron -- it 's been a mighty impressive run . [ Via Slashgear

Before publishing your next blog post consider two little words .
Those two words are , “ So what . ”
As a college sophomore , I was handing in a writing essay to one of my writing instructors .
I gleefully said , “ Here ’s my essay . ”
She replied , “ So what ? ”
At the time , her comment made me really upset .
I thought she was being extremely mean .
Honestly though , it ’s one of the best writing tips I ever got .
Later my instructor explained to me that she only said , “ So what ” to writers with potential – which what , was supposed to make me feel better ?
It did n’t .
Not until she told me the following …
“ As a writer we need to take the position of the reader .
We need to think carefully – when a reader reads my words , are they going to feel anything ?
Are your time invested words going to invite people to say , “ So what ? ”
Will your words matter to even one reader – counting yourself ?
If not , you should n’t write those words . ”
My instructor said , “ So what , ” so that I ’d consider my words before handing them over to her or anyone else .
As a blogger , you do n’t want readers saying “ So what . ”
You want readers to say things ( or at least think things ) like :
“ Wow , what an amazing post ! ”
“ This post really changed my life for the better . ”
“ This post moved me .
It was so sad , yet , I ’m glad I read it . ”
“ I love that this post taught me something new . ”
“ You helped me to solve a problem . ”
“ Well , I ’m convinced ! ”
“ I clicked the links because of what you said . ”
“ After reading your post , I ’m going to act on your suggestion . ”
“ You can really relate to my situation . ”
“ This is the news I needed to hear . ”
“ You really know how to share information ; not simply lecture . ”
“ I subscribed so I wo n’t miss another post . ”
Even , “ I can not believe this post !
It made me so angry .
I do n’t agree at all and you suck ! ”
The key is to only publish content that matters .
Are you helping someone , entertaining someone , getting a rant off your chest , moving someone to do something , helping someone to feel a feeling ?
Those are reasons that matter .
If you create posts full of keywords , just to gain hits .
If you pull news and re-post it word for word , with no extra input , I guarantee , your readers are going to say , “ So what . ”
Their lives wo n’t have changed one bit from reading that post you published .
I think it ’s useful to note , that we ca n’t wow everyone all the time .
However , regularly taking your reader ’s position will increase the odds of your posts hitting the wow - factor mark more often .

Mars too salty to sustain life
Life on Mars may have been snuffed out early on because the water there was too salty , a biologist involved in exploring the red planet says .
" Mars has been a very dry place for a very long time , " says Professor Andrew Knoll , a member of a team operating two US robots that are currently exploring Mars .
" The best place to look for life is in the earliest history , " he adds .
" It was really salty and difficult for microorganisms to survive in this water , " he says , citing discoveries by the robots that back up earlier theories that strong concentrations of minerals killed off life .
The Harvard University researcher was speaking on the sidelines of the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science .
But the discoveries by the robots roving the planet , Spirit and Opportunity , cannot confirm whether life ever existed on Mars .
" If there is a habitable niche , it 's underground " on the planet , says the head scientist for the mission , Professor Steven Squyres of Cornell University .
Life anywhere else would leave atmospheric traces of gas produced by organisms .
According to another theory cited by Knoll , " a large meteorite may have sterilised life on Mars " .
In December the US space agency NASA says the Sprint robot had discovered nearly pure silicon on Mars .
Squyres says this silicon forms near natural hot water sources or volcanic outlets , which give off natural gas .
On Earth , living microbes are found in such situations .
A look at lives lost as U.S. deaths in Iraq near 4,000
One in six were too young to buy a beer .
About two dozen were old enough for an AARP card .
Eleven died on Thanksgiving Day , 11 on Christmas , and at least five on their birthdays .
One percent were named Smith .
As the nation approaches its 4,000th Iraq war fatality — on Thursday the toll stood at 3,983 servicemembers plus eight Defense Department civilians — a USA TODAY analysis shows who gave their lives , where they came from and how they fell :
• Ninety - eight percent were male ( compared with 99.9 % of those lost in Vietnam ) .
Three - quarters were non-Hispanic white ( compared with 86 % in Vietnam ) .
The most common age was 21 ( 20 in Vietnam ) .
• Nine percent were officers , including 24 lieutenant colonels and six colonels .
• More of the fallen were based at Fort Hood in Texas than at any other military installation .
• New York City , which has lost 62 residents , had more deaths than any other hometown .
• More than half of the nearly 4,000 ( 52 % ) were killed by bombs , 16 % by enemy gunfire .
Five percent died in aircraft crashes .
Fifty - five people drowned , and 15 were electrocuted .
Almost one in five died from what the military terms " non-hostile " causes .
• Since the war began in March 2003 , the Pentagon has reported double - digit U.S. fatalities on 35 days .
The bloodiest was Jan. 26 , 2005 , when a Marine helicopter crashed in a sandstorm , killing all 31 aboard , and six other servicemembers died in combat .
The bloodiest month was November 2004 , when 137 died ; the least bloody was February 2004 , when 21 were lost .
On 460 days of the war , no servicemember died .
HONORING THE FALLEN : Names mean more than numbers
The nearly 4,000 deaths — not including 482 troops killed in Afghanistan and the wider war on terrorism — are small by the standards of modern warfare .
The total is less than two - thirds the U.S. fatalities during the World War II battle of Iwo Jima , which lasted about a month ; less than U.S. losses on each of the first three days of the Battle of the Bulge ; and less than a fourth of U.S. fatalities in Vietnam in 1968 alone .
Is the upcoming 4,000th death more notable than the 3,999th or 4,001st ?
" Four thousand is a good round number people can grab hold of , " says Morten Ender , a U.S. Military Academy sociologist who studies the military .
" It reminds us of what 's going on with a war that , since the ( military 's troop ) surge , seems to have lost its place in the public mind . "
Whether anyone pays attention to the benchmark is something else .
" People tend not to be numerologists , " says John Mueller , an Ohio State expert on war and public opinion .
" These milestones basically have little effect on public support for a war .
It 's not like the stock market ; people are more affected by events in wars than numbers . "

The Lead Up :
We 're immersed in the movie for a full hour already .
We 've seen the most graphic vision of D - Day ever shown on film .
We 've learned of the mission to save one man and we 've seen the team lose a man in exchange .
Philosophical questions abound when suddenly the soldiers find themselves face to face with a squad of Nazis .
Everyone has their guns pointed at one another , sweat is slowly forming on top of each and every brow .
People are screaming in German and English and the entire theater is quiet with tense anticipation .
And then it happens , the Germans get mowed down by ...

Why it Nearly Ruined the Movie :
Maybe they got the idea to cast an ' 80s sitcom star in a war movie from Casualties of War .
That Vietnam movie answered the question " Who do people want to see in a horrifying movie about cultural and oh so literal rape ? " with the name Alex P. Keaton .
But Sgt. Sam Malone causes even more problems than Private Marty McFly , because his whole comedic persona on Cheers was based around a stone - faced droll delivery .
So when he actually tries to be serious , you just keep waiting for him to crack a joke about how much tail he used to score when he was pitching in the minors .

Think back right now and see if you can remember anything about Ted Danson 's role in the movie .

Sam :
Hey there guys , looks like you 've had a rough day .
Sit down and tell me all about it .
Tom Hanks :
We 're looking for a Ryan .

Sam : Ryan eh ?
Let me go check .
Carla !
Hey Carla !
You know guy named Ryan ?
Sergeant Carla : Yeah , two of my eight kids are named Ryan .
Sam : No , Private James Ryan .
Poor sap lost all his brothers and these guys need to find him .
Sergeant Carla : Have n't seen 'em .
But you can have my boys instead .
They 're already proficient with firearms .

Tom Hanks :
Thanks anyways , we 'll be leaving now .
Lucky for us , Danson 's only on screen for about six minutes , and Spielberg sucks us back into the action with a 10 - minute scene of the guys holed up in a church for the night doing nothing but talking .

A new sharia law controversy erupted last night over Government plans to issue special " Islamic bonds " to pay for Gordon Brown 's public - spending programme by raising money from the Middle East .
Britain is to become the first Western nation to issue bonds approved by Muslim clerics in line with sharia law , which bans conventional loans involving interest payments as " sinful " .
The scheme would mark one of the most significant economic advances of sharia law in the non-Muslim world .
It will lead to the ownership of Government buildings and other assets currently belonging to British taxpayers being switched wholesale to wealthy Middle - Eastern businessmen and banks .
The Government sees sharia - compliant bonds as a way of tapping Middle - East money and building bridges with the Muslim community .
But critics say the scheme would waste money and could undermine Britain 's financial and legal systems .
Senior Conservative MP Edward Leigh , chairman of the Commons Public Accounts Committee , said : " I am concerned about the signal this would send – it could be the thin end of the wedge .
" British Common Law must be supreme and should apply to everyone . "
A spokesman for the National Secular Society said : " There are lots of different ways to arrange financing .
" Constructing financial instruments to be sharia - compliant seems to me to involve a lot of unnecessary complication , which will serve only to make a lot of lawyers very rich . "
The attempt to embrace Islamic financing would also appear to be at odds with Mr Brown 's promise to promote Britishness and British values and institutions .
The Treasury has already faced heavy criticism for removing Britannia from 50 p coins .
Other Western nations have been reluctant to issue Islamic bonds .
In the United States the bonds are banned partly as a result of claims that the money could be linked to terrorism .
Approval : Chancellor Alistair Darling is ready to give the go - ahead to sharia - compliant bonds
The Treasury proposal follows the heated debate over the Archbishop of Canterbury Dr Rowan Williams 's claim that the spread of elements of sharia law in parts of Britain was " inevitable " .
Downing Street distanced Gordon Brown from Dr Williams 's comments .
A spokesman said : " The Prime Minister is very clear that British laws must be based on British values and that religious law , while respecting other cultures , should be subservient to British criminal and civil law . "
However , The Mail on Sunday has established that Chancellor Alistair Darling is ready to give the go - ahead to sharia - compliant bonds – known as " sukuk " , an early Arabic form of cheque .
Treasury officials have been working behind the scenes for months on the plan .
The deadline for responses to Mr Darling 's consultation document setting out how the bonds will work expires on Thursday .
The Islamic bonds proposal was devised by Mr Brown 's former Treasury adviser Ed Balls , now Schools Secretary and the Premier 's most powerful Cabinet ally .
He claims it is a vital way of improving relations with Muslims in Britain as well as helping the UK to obtain vast sums from Middle - East banks in oil - rich nations such as Dubai and Qatar .
Sharia - compliant bonds have been issued by the governments of Pakistan and Malaysia and private banks but never by a Western government .
Treasury officials say the aim is to attract big investors as well as making it easier for British Muslims to invest in National Savings products at banks and post offices .
The Government has already backed Islamic car loans and mortgages .
Sharia - compliant bonds were designed to get round the ban on paying interest – " riba " in Islamic law .
The Koran says it is sinful to make money from money .
Unlike a conventional bond which is debt - based , a " sukuk " is asset - based .
Instead of receiving interest , bond holders receive " rent " on the asset , thereby complying with sharia law .
The Treasury consultation document says Government assets such as " buildings or a piece of infrastructure " would be switched to a " special - purpose vehicle " set up to administer the bond .
This would be carried out by a contract known as an " ijara " .
The asset would then be leased back by the Government , generating rental payments for the Islamic bond holders .
When the " sukuk " matured , the Government would guarantee to buy back the asset , allowing the bond - holders to get their redemption payments .
" Sukuk are akin to Islamic investment certificates , " the document says .
" They are designed to be in compliance with sharia law , the divine law in Islam which is based on the Quran . "
Islamic bonds are slightly more expensive than Western - style bonds , mainly because they require extensive legal and religious advice .
The Treasury initiative has been given added impetus by the worldwide credit squeeze , which is making it harder for all governments to raise money .
The Government says the bonds will also help London retain its position ahead of New York and Frankfurt as the world 's leading financial centre .
Global Islamic finance assets , including private equity and bonds , are now said to be worth up to £ 150 billion .
Sukuk volumes have soared from almost nothing to £ 35 billion in the past ten years .
Maurice Fitzpatrick , a senior tax partner at accountants Grant Thornton , said : " The Treasury wants to borrow money from as wide a range of sources as possible .
" Sharia bonds might well prove to be more expensive , but we would not know for sure until it was put into practice . "
Special rules for Islamic finances have been challenged by Mahmoud El - Gamal , chairman of Islamic economics at Rice University , Houston .
" The main beneficiaries are lawyers , multi-national banks and self - styled religious scholars retained as consultants to certify the Islamicity of re-engineered financial products , " he said .
Muslim Labour peer Lord Ahmed said : " This is a positive step for Muslims in Britain but the main reason for doing it is to attract money to the UK from Middle - East investors .
Claims that it is connected to terrorist funds are absurd . "
The hijacking of Shareaza.com is a complex story with many twists and turns .
Here is the story of Shareaza from its open source GPL roots , to the hostile takeover and where the project is today , directly from those at the heart of the news - the real Shareaza community .
The fight for Shareaza has only just begun .
Beginnings Are a Good Place To Start
In mid 2002 , a lone programmer by the name of Micheal Stokes released the first version of a Gnutella client he had written , dubbed “ Shareaza ” .
Over the next two years Micheal added to his client and coded in support for the eDonkey 2000 network , BitTorrent and a rewritten Gnutella - based protocol which he named Gnutella2 .
Shareaza gradually became more and more popular and Mike started to receive several job offers based on the strength of his work on Shareaza .
He eventually decided that continuing to work on a p2p application in an increasingly hostile legal climate was too risky , but he did the honorable thing and released the Shareaza source code under the GNU GPLv2 on June 1 , 2004 ( which coincided with the release of Shareaza V 2.0 ) .
Mike stopped working on Shareaza and went on to develop a new p2p - based streaming radio project named Mercora .
As part of distancing himself from Shareaza , he transfered the shareaza.com domain to one of his old alpha testers named Jon Nilson , who continued to administer the domain until late 2007 .
The French ( RIAA ) Connection
In late 2007 the Shareaza website went down for several weeks , but eventually came back online .
Not long after that , the Shareaza.com domain began pointing to a different website which several sharp - eyed community members recognized as identical to shareazaweb.com , a known scam site purporting to offer users “ legal p2 p downloads ” .
It emerged that Jon Nilson had been forced to relinquish control of the domain as part of a settlement with La Societe Des Producteurs De Phonogrammes En France ( the French version of the RIAA ) .
Jon ’s name was the only one connected with Shareaza that the SPPF could find and due to Shareaza ’s popularity in France he had been named in a lawsuit along with Azureus and Morpheus .
See here for more .
A Dump for Ill - Gotten Gains
Members of the Shareaza community managed to track the new “ owners ” of the Shareaza.com domain to MusicLab LLC , based in New York .
MusicLab now distribute the “ new and legal ” iMesh p2 p client after the original Gnutella - based iMesh developers were sued by the RIAA , and forced to settle for $ 4.1 million with a promise to turn their app into a paid download service .
A similar legal fate befell another popular Gnutella application called Bearshare which was then rolled into the RIAA - approved iMesh .
Nobody has managed to ascertain whether the original iMesh developers are still involved , but the merging of Bearshare seems to indicate that MusicLab is a vehicle used by the recording industry to dump assets acquired through lawsuits into .
It would seem that since Shareaza is developed by anonymous group of individuals and organized via “ ad - hocracy ” , there was no company to sue , so stealth tactics were employed against the weakest link in the chain : Jon Nilson .
iMesh , Bearshare and the fake Shareaza being distributed from Shareaza.com are all the same application with appropriate re-branding .
Threats of C&D
As you can imagine , the members of the Shareaza community were rather upset about all of this and set up a new website with user forums .
After two users made some offhand remarks about a distributed denial of service attack against the servers in Israel where the hijacked Shareaza.com site is located , our forum administrator received an email from one Jeffrey A. Kimmel of Meister Seelig & Fein , in his capacity as a representative of Discordia Ltd , the new new “ owners ” of Shareaza .
Mr Kimmel stated that DDoS attacks are illegal and any further talk by “ users [ who ] begin to promote the destruction of a legitimate business ” would result in Discordia Ltd “ tak[ing ] all necessary action to vigorously and relentlessly protect its rights . ”
He went on to state that “ if this action is not immediately taken and , as result , our client ’s business is harmed , we will not only pursue , locate and hold fully responsible each and every one of those who have implemented this , or any similar DoS , but also those responsible for maintaining your site and the forums . ”
The posts in question had actually been taken down by forum moderators already ( as per forum rules on objectionable content ) , however this email was cause for great concern : not only were the domain hijackers starting to create a series of shell companies to avoid being identified , but they had engaged lawyers to monitor our forums and threaten anyone making disparaging statements about them .

A Tangled Web
More research by community members revealed that Discordia Ltd is registered in Cyprus , possibly owned by MusicLab but at arm ’s length to avoid as much fallout as possible .
Meister Seelig & Fein ’s Kimmel also appears to have a long history of dealings with the recording industry , notably in the participation of the iMesh and Bearshare lawsuits and an interesting Amicus Curiae brief in the MGM vs Grokster which details how the new iMesh software has all the answers to stopping piracy and creating a wonderful legal download service .
Making The Takeover Official
In what is possibly the most audacious step so far , Discordia Ltd filed for a trademark on “ Shareaza ” with the USPTO on January 10 , 2008 .
( Link )
If granted , our use of the Shareaza name will immediately infringe upon Discordia Ltd ’s official trademark and we will doubtless be subject to legal action until we stop any infringing action i.e. we rename the project , remove all references to “ Shareaza ” and forget about the whole thing .
The Danger Posed To Open Source Software
Unless we are able to prevent the trademark being granted and regain control of the domain , our project will die .
It really is as simple as that .
Seven - odd years worth of brand recognition as “ Open Source , Spyware , Malware and Advertising Free ” will disappear and although we can ( and have ) dealt with “ clones ” who take our OS code base , add some spyware and release a “ new ” client as their own ( breaking the GPL v2 in the process by not releasing the source ) there is no possible way that we can survive having our identity stolen like this .
Unlike a run -of - the - mill copyright violation , we are going to be permanently deprived of something .
Our code is open to whoever wants to see it , we charge no money for the use of the program ; the only thing of value that we have is the name and recognition that goes with it .
The worst of it all is that this “ software identity theft ” could signal the beginning of hostile corporate takeovers of common property – the fact that we are in this predicament proves it to some extent .
What we need to know is if the people who stood up for an open culture by hacking copyright law will help protect that culture where it comes to trademarks and halting the advancement of encroaching corporate interests .
If “ common law ” trademarks ca n’t be protected there is a very real danger that what happened to us will happen again and again and again .
Many of us who work on the Shareaza project can foresee things becoming so that people will stop bothering to work on OS projects : open source software is , by it ’s nature , more useful that closed source software and the more useful something is , the more popular it becomes … and then someone with expensive lawyers will come along and take it all away from the people who actually created it .
We recently asked for donations from our users for a legal defense fund and ( very ) quickly raised $ 2000 .
In our public thank you letter we wrote the following :
“ There is one fundamental right that should never be in dispute : the right to be recognized as a creator .
This moral right transcends arguments on whether copyright should last for 50 years or a hundred , whether software should be patentable or not , or even what a fair price price for an MP3 file is .
Being able to say to the world “ I made this ” and be acknowledged for it is , for many people , the only reward they receive for their work .
To deny that right is an insult to the creative forces flowing through every writer , performer , musician , actor and programmer who brings their work to the world . ”
We have a section dedicated to this whole situation on our new forums which includes full details of all the events that have taken place so far .
Any help you are able to provide would be very , very gratefully accepted .
Any advice , introductions or referrals to others who may be able to help us will be a great help .
Kind regards ,

On haskell - cafe , ajb , aka Pseudonym , laments that many people do n't have enough experience with comonads to recognise them .
So I thought I 'd mention a really simple example of a comonad that nevertheless captures the essence of a large class of comonads .
It 's conceptually not much different to my cellular automaton example ( making this a bit of a rerun ) , but this should be easier to understand .
And if it 's too trivial , I hint at a particle physics connection towards the end .
Firstly , you can skip this paragraph if you do n't want a quick bit of theoretical discussion .
Consider arrays of fixed dimension .
As types , they look something like Xfor some fixed integer N. From a container we construct its zipper by applying X d/dX .
In this case we get XNX=NX .
In other words , the corresponding zipper is an array paired with an index into the array .
We can stretch the meaning of comonad slightly to allow this to relate to arrays whose size is n't fixed .
So here 's some code :
The usual definition of Comonad :
And now a type that is a pair of an array and an index into that array :
Think of it as an array with one of its elements singled out for special attention .
It trivially inherits the functoriality of ordinary arrays :
And now comes the Comonad implementation . serves to pop out the special element from its context - in other words it gives you the special element , whle throwing away the array it lived in . , on the other hand , applies a functionof typeto the entire array .
The function is applied to each element in turn , making each element the special element for long enough to applyCompare withfor arrays .
This walks through each element in turn , applying a function to each element , and return an array of results .
The computation for each element is separate from all the others .
Withhowever , the entire array may be used for the computation of each element of the result , with the index into the array serving to indicate which element it is we should be focussing on .
For example , here 's an array of values :
We want to consider this to be a circular array so that going off one end wraps around to the beginning :
Now here 's a simple operation that ' blurs ' the single ith pixel in the 1 - D image represented by x: We can apply this to the entire image thusly Note the curious way I have to useas an input to .
There seems to be a redundancy here , we want the resulting array and do n't care what the focussed element is .
Butwants us to give it a focal point .
Curiously it 's making explicit something that 's familiar to C programmers , but is slightly hidden in C .
In C , you refer to an array of floats using a .
But the same type points to elements of the array as well .
So when you point to an array , you are , in effect , blurring the distinction between a pointer to an array and a pointer to the first element .
Comonads make that distinction explicit .
Anyway , suppose you wanted to apply a sequence of operations .
Adding , blurring , scaling , nonlinearly transforming and so on .
You could write a pipeline likeNote how .
If you think of fmap as farming out workloads to a SIMD processor with one thread applied to each array element , sequences of fmaps correspond to threads that can continue to work independently .
The comonadic operations , however , correspond to stepswhere the threads must synchronise and talk to each other .
I believe this last statement explains the a cryptic comment in the comments to this blog entry
One final thing going back to my optional paragraph above .
If D means d/dX then we can see the operator XD as a kind of number operator .
When you apply it to an array like Xthe array becomes multiplied by a type corresponding to the array index type .
For ordinary arrays , these are just integers .
So you can see XD as a way of counting how many elements there are in a container .
Also , for any container F , we also have the equations D ( XF ) = XDF+F , which we can write as DX=XD+1 .
At some point , when I have time , I 'll point out how this is closely related to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle and how when we say that differentiation makes holes in a data type , it 's related to the notion of a hole in solid state physics .
Oh , and I sketched this diagram but do n't have time to write an explanation :

With the delegate count still under way , NBC News said Obama appears to have won around 840 delegates in yesterday ’s contests , while Clinton earned about 830 .
Obama claims delegate lead
In a surprise twist after a chaotic Super Tuesday , Sen. Barack Obama ( D - Ill. ) passed Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton ( D - N.Y. ) in network tallies of the number of delegates the candidates racked up last night .
The Obama camp now projects topping Clinton by 13 delegates , 847 to 834 .
Advertisement
NBC News , which is projecting delegates based on the Democratic Party 's complex formula , figures Obama will wind up with 840 to 849 delegates , versus 829 to 838 for Clinton .
Clinton was portrayed in many news accounts as the night ’s big winner , but Obama ’s campaign says he wound up with a higher total where it really counts — the delegates who will choose the party ’s nominee at this summer ’s Democratic convention .
With the delegate count still under way , NBC News said Obama appears to have won around 840 delegates in yesterday ’s contests , while Clinton earned about 830 — “ give or take a few , ” Tim Russert , the network ’s Washington bureau chief , said on the “ Today ” show .
The running totals for the two , which includes previous contests and the party officials known as “ superdelegates , ” are only about 70 delegates apart , Russert said .
The bottom line is that the two are virtually tied .
Obama won 13 states , some of them smaller , and Clinton won eight .
On Wednesday morning , the battle was on to shape public perceptions about Tuesday .
The Clinton campaign said it was crunching its delegate numbers but was not sure it was correct that Obama got more .
The Obama campaign sent an e-mailed statement titled : “ Obama wins Super Tuesday by winning more states and more delegates . ”
Campaign Manager David Plouffe said : “ By winning a majority of delegates and a majority of the states , Barack Obama won an important Super Tuesday victory over Sen. Clinton in the closest thing we have to a national primary . ”
“ From Colorado and Utah in the West to Georgia and Alabama in the South to Sen . Clinton ’s backyard in Connecticut , Obama showed that he can win the support of Americans of every race , gender and political party in every region of the country , ” Plouffe said .
“ That ’s why he’s on track to win Democratic nomination , and that ’s why he ’s the best candidate to defeat John McCain in November . ”
The Obama campaign attached an Excel spreadsheet containing “ state - by - state estimates of the pledged delegates we won last night , which total 845 for Obama and 836 for Clinton — bringing the to - date total of delegates to 908 for Obama , 884 for Clinton . ”
CIA rendition flights resume
Reports of CIA tagged aircraft in multiple countries
CIA aircraft named by a European Union report as participating in the US ' extraordinary rendition ' program have been seen landing in two countries over the last week , raising fresh concerns that the program is not over , as the US contends .
According to a report in an Irish newspaper , four CIA jets identified in the EU report have landed this month .
The planes -- identified by tail numbers -- are operated by Centurion Aviation Services , a shell company for the CIA , and were allegedly used for the illegal detention and transport of prisoners between various countries .
In an extraordinary rendition , US agents pick up a suspected terrorist in one country and transport them to another country with less strict prohibitions on torture for interrogation .

HUNGARY : ( look at this carefully since it seems to be old photo , but its still a report : )
http://www.upi.com/NewsTrack/TopNews/2008/03/12/ciarenditionflightspottedinhungary/3487/
IRELAND : http://www.limerickleader.ie/shannon/Four-suspect-CIA-flights-refuel.3874652.jp
A PLANE believed to be carrying CIA prisoners has stopped over at a small airport in southwestern Norway , local media reported .
The suspected ' rendition ' flight was made from Brno in the Czech Republic to Sola airport near Stavanger .
The plane refueled before flying on to the Keflavik airport in Iceland , local newspaper Stavanger Aftenblad reported , quoting airport officials .
Norwegian newspaper Aftenposten said the aircraft belonged to Aviation Specialities Ing , a company often used by the CIA for its controversial prisoner transport and so - called rendition flights , according to a 2006 European parliament report .
Extraordinary rendition , whereby suspects are transferred covertly to a third country or to US - run detention centres , has been harshly criticised since it began in the aftermath of the September 11 , 2001 attacks in the United States .
Neither the Sola airport authorities nor Norway 's foreign ministry responded to AFP requests for comment , but ministry spokeswoman Kristin Melsom told Stavanger Aftenblad the government had not been informed about Friday 's flight .
`` The only thing I can say is what we have said in the past : US authorities respect Norwegian laws and these planes are not used to illegally transport prisoners , '' she said .
According to the newspaper , as many as 15 flights suspected of transporting CIA prisoners were registered at Sola airport between 2003 and 2007 .
As for independent public - health researchers , they say they ca n’t study the problem without the cooperation of the livestock industry , which , not surprisingly , has not been forthcoming .
For what if these researchers should find proof that one of the hidden costs of cheap meat is an epidemic of drug - resistant infection among young people ?
There would be calls to revolutionize the way we produce meat in this country .
This is not something that the meat and the pharmaceutical industries or their respective regulatory “ watchdogs ”  the Department of Agriculture and F.D.A.  are in any rush to see happen .
he second story is about honeybees , which have endured their own mysterious epidemic this past year .
Colony Collapse Disorder was first identified in 2006 , when a Pennsylvanian beekeeper noticed that his bees were disappearing  going out on foraging expeditions in the morning never to return .
Within months , beekeepers in 24 states were reporting losses of between 20 percent and 80 percent of their bees , in some cases virtually overnight .
Entomologists have yet to identify the culprit , but suspects include a virus , agricultural pesticides and a parasitic mite .
( Media reports that genetically modified crops or cellphone towers might be responsible have been discounted . )
But whatever turns out to be the immediate cause of colony collapse , many entomologists believe some such disaster was waiting to happen : the lifestyle of the modern honeybee leaves the insects so stressed out and their immune systems so compromised that , much like livestock on factory farms , they ’ve become vulnerable to whatever new infectious agent happens to come along .
You need look no farther than a California almond orchard to understand how these bees , which have become indispensable workers in the vast fields of industrial agriculture , could have gotten into such trouble .
Like a great many other food crops , like an estimated one out of every three bites you eat , the almond depends on bees for pollination .
No bees , no almonds .
The problem is that almonds today are grown in such vast monocultures  80 percent of the world ’s crop comes from a 600,000 - acre swath of orchard in California ’s Central Valley  that , when the trees come into bloom for three weeks every February , there are simply not enough bees in the valley to pollinate all those flowers .
For what bee would hang around an orchard where there ’s absolutely nothing to eat for the 49 weeks of the year that the almond trees are n’t in bloom ?
So every February the almond growers must import an army of migrant honeybees to the Central Valley  more than a million hives housing as many as 40 billion bees in all .
They come on the backs of tractor - trailers from as far away as New England .
These days , more than half of all the beehives in America are on the move to California every February , for what has been called the world ’s greatest “ pollination event . ”
( Be there ! )
Bees that have been dormant in the depths of a Minnesota winter are woken up to go to work in the California spring ; to get them in shape to travel cross-country and wade into the vast orgy of almond bloom , their keepers ply them with “ pollen patties ”  which often include ingredients like high - fructose corn syrup and flower pollen imported from China .
Because the pollination is so critical and the bee population so depleted , almond growers will pay up to $ 150 to rent a box of bees for three weeks , creating a multimillion - dollar industry of migrant beekeeping that barely existed a few decades ago .
Thirty - five years ago you could rent a box of bees for $ 10 .
( Pimping bees is the whole of the almond business for these beekeepers since almond honey is so bitter as to be worthless . )
In 2005 the demand for honeybees in California had so far outstripped supply that the U.S.D.A. approved the importation of bees from Australia .
These bees get off a 747 at SFO and travel by truck to the Central Valley , where they get to work pollinating almond flowers  and mingling with bees arriving from every corner of America .
As one beekeeper put it to Singeli Agnew in The San Francisco Chronicle , California ’s almond orchards have become “ one big brothel ”  a place where each February bees swap microbes and parasites from all over the country and the world before returning home bearing whatever pathogens they may have picked up .
Add to this their routine exposure to agricultural pesticides and you have a bee population ripe for an epidemic national in scope .
In October , the journal Science published a study that implicated a virus ( Israeli Acute Paralysis Virus ) in Colony Collapse Disorder  a virus that was found in some of the bees from Australia .
( The following month , the U.S.D.A. questioned the study , pointing out that the virus was present in North America as early as 2002 . )
“ We ’re placing so many demands on bees we ’re forgetting that they ’re a living organism and that they have a seasonal life cycle , ” Marla Spivak , a honeybee entomologist at the University of Minnesota , told The Chronicle .
“ We ’re wanting them to function as a machine .
. . .
We ’re expecting them to get off the truck and be fine . ”
We ’re asking a lot of our bees .
We ’re asking a lot of our pigs too .
That seems to be a hallmark of industrial agriculture : to maximize production and keep food as cheap as possible , it pushes natural systems and organisms to their limit , asking them to function as efficiently as machines .
When the inevitable problems crop up  when bees or pigs remind us they are not machines  the system can be ingenious in finding “ solutions , ” whether in the form of antibiotics to keep pigs healthy or foreign bees to help pollinate the almonds .
But this year ’s solutions have a way of becoming next year ’s problems .
That is to say , they are n’t “ sustainable . ”
From this perspective , the story of Colony Collapse Disorder and the story of drug - resistant staph are the same story .
Both are parables about the precariousness of monocultures .
Whenever we try to rearrange natural systems along the lines of a machine or a factory , whether by raising too many pigs in one place or too many almond trees , whatever we may gain in industrial efficiency , we sacrifice in biological resilience .
The question is not whether systems this brittle will break down , but when and how , and whether when they do , we ’ll be prepared to treat the whole idea of sustainability as something more than a nice word .

How Bush Took Us to the Dark Side
Water is unleashed from Glen Canyon Dam towards the Grand Canyon in the United States - an experiment to mimic natural floods and recharge the ecosystem .
More than 300,000 gallons ( 1.1 m litres ) of water per second gushed from giant steel tubes into the river - the equivalent of turning on 1.3 m garden hoses simultaneously .
US Secretary of the Interior Dirk Kempthorne , in the blue shirt at the railing , released the valves .
He said the volume of water could fill the Empire State Building in 20 minutes .
The manmade flood will carry rich sedimentary residue to nourish the Grand Canyon area , improving the fish habitat in the river and rebuilding beaches .
Water levels along the Colorado river rose quickly after the flood was released .
Since the dam was built in 1963 , 98 % of the sediment carried by the river has been lost .
Before then the river , near the Arizona - Utah border , was muddy , and natural flooding built up sandbars essential to native plant and fish species .
After the flood ends on Friday , it is hoped the water will leave behind sediment , and restore sandbars , as it goes back to normal levels .

Hey , you want to hear the New World whining at Old Europe ?
Here it is , from a press conference Condi Rice gave about Kosovo : " I mean after all , we 're talking about something from 1389 .
1389 !
It 's time to move forward .
And Serbia needs to move forward .
Kosovo needs to move forward . "
Well , I think we can all agree that 1389 was a while back , and that all things considered , " forward " is generally a good way to go .
And not just for Serbia .
No , Ma’am .
It applies just as much to Kosovo .
" But hold on , Gary , " you may be yelling at your computer , " what ’s all this about 1389 anyway ? "
Well , as historical expert types like me and Condi know , that happens to be the date of one of the coolest battles in history .
And since it happened in Kosovo , they decided to call it the Battle of Kosovo .
I ’ll get to the battle in a minute -- it ’s a glorious battle and deserves retelling -- but first I want to talk about Condi ’s tantrum over people caring about stuff that happened long ago .
I ’ve heard this a lot : " Ca n’t they just get over it ? "
There ’s some rule in California , it ’s like a misdemeanor to care about anything that happened more than a week ago .
And Condi , the all - American spinster , picked up that notion and ran with it , because as we all know Condi had to be twice as dull as her rivals .
So here ’s Condi solving the problems of Balkan history in a mall - girl whine : " I mean come ON !
1389 ?
I was n’t even BORN then ! "
Serbs just can't " get over it . "
Well , Condi , have a seat on that mall ottoman , the one between the American Eagle store and the foodcourt , and let Uncle Gary tell you something very important :
You see , L’il Condi , some people actually care about stuff that happened a long time ago .
Yeah , seriously .
Like , for example , me .
I care more about one particular day in 1779 than I do about my whole sophomore year in high school .
Because on September 23 , 1779 a Scottish - American rebel privateer named John Paul Jones maneuvered his soggy old raider , the Bon Homme Richard , next to a much bigger British warship , the Serapis , and lashed the ships together to make sure no quarter could be asked or given .
And even though the Brits blew his little ship apart right under him , Jones refused to surrender and scared his Brit counterparts into surrendering themselves .
That day gave me a reason to live .
All my sophomore year gave me was the strong impression that people were stupid and nasty .
So excuse me , Condi , I ’ll take 1779 .
A lot of people will take any year in the past over a lot of years in the present .
And the year 1389 , the one you want the Serbs to get over ?
Well , 1389 means even more to the Serbs than Jones ’ victory means to me .
The battle they fought against the Turks that year is the main plotline in every song and story the Serbs tell to this day .
It taught generations of Serb boys what was expected of them , how honorable warriors are supposed to act .
I suspect Condi ’s other , deeper problem with the Serbs ’ 1389 - ophilia is that the Serbs did n’t even win that day .
Talk about un-American !
They hang around dreaming of this old battle , and it was a defeat ?
Gawd , get a life !
Well , not everybody wants a life , Condi .
There ’s a lot to be said for glorious death instead .
Ever read the Bible , for example ?
Not that you have to .
A lot of the great old European warrior stories are about defeats .
The Anglo - Saxons sang about getting stomped by the Vikings at Maldon , and the Franks just could n’t get enough of the Song of Roland , which is a whole epic poem about how Roland , Charlemagne ’s Custer , lost his whole command .
They should do a poster of that battle , with Roland as this Conan - the - Barbarian hero battling to the end , surrounded by hacked Saracens , wearing a t - shirt that says , " It ’s a Euro thing , you would n’t understand . "

I listened to the audio .
I recommend listening to the whole thing .
VP at one point was talking about how after working with the CIA 's Publication Review Board for over a year , the CIA informed her that she must not publish over half of her memoirs , because they divulged the dates of her employment with the CIA , and that information was classified .
That got my attention , and so I went to the page she mentioned , and WOW , THAT is interesting : Check it out here :

Valarie and Sibel .
Stay away from GITMO .
Supreme bushie says courts can't stop torture :
Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia rejected the notion that US courts have any control over the actions of American troops at Guantanamo Bay , argued that torture of terror detainees is not banned under the US Constitution and insisted that the high court has no obligation to act as a moral beacon for other nations .
" We do n't pretend to be some Western Mullahs who decide what is right and wrong for the whole world , " Scalia told a BBC interviewer Tuesday , defending narrow interpretation of the reach the US Constitution gives the nine justices on the country 's high court .
Scalia said it was " extraordinary " to suggest that the 8th Amendment , which prohibits the government from engaging in " cruel and unusual punishment , " could be applied to the actions of US interrogators questioning foreign subjects detained overseas .
In his view , Scalia said that while the 8th Amendment would prohibit locking up someone indefinitely as punishment for a crime , for example , the CIA or military would be perfectly justified keeping a suspected insurgent or member of al Qaeda imprisoned forever if the detainee refused to answer questions .
( Scalia wags tongue ) .

There were , and have been in past votes on this issue , some reports of certain Senator 's offices getting 60 % of their calls in favor of immunity .
Now .... either the wingnuts are vastly more popular than the polls would have us believe ... or the wingnuts are vastly more organized than they 've ever given any indication of being before ... or a specialized lobbying campaign is being targeted at legislators ... probably at legislators regarded as weak , vulnerable , or otherwise malleable .
These reports were from Daily Kos commenters and were , perforce , carefully worded to avoid the dkosian headliners reflexive banning of anyone posting anything they even think might even resemble a " conspiracy theory " ... but this much filtered through : someone 's got a fairly organized and probably funded effort going on to lie wholesale to legislators about an imaginary wave of popular support for telecom immunity and warrantless wiretapping .
That they were deceived wo n't save the legislators from the wrath of the voters come primary day ... assuming the voters are allowed any wrath ... but a Noise Machine operation would n't care about that .
The damage will have already been done .
How to check this out ?
How to verify it ?
How to counter it NOW ... when the Bush Dogs in the House are already being given their marching orders and Pelosi is planning a graceful cave - in with Boehner 's help ?

... Dredd wondered ...
" Yep , and " somebody " might have given them free long distance and special phone lines for the exercise ? ? "
Now that 's conspiracy theorizing ... and no evidence for any of your suppositions
But finding out the percentages of calls / faxes / emails to House members that are for / against the Senate bill and comparing those percentages with area and national polls to see if they 're even in the same spacetime continuum seems both reasonable and necessary .
Even a " vocal minority " would seem hard put to get a Democratic Senator 's call ratio up to 60 /40 in favor of this Orwellian nightmare ... which is the kind of range that has been reported in several dkos comments over the past few months .
The input of voters can only be a part of this battle ... but it would be plain stupid to throw away any of our efforts with the trite phrase " The wingnuts have a better phone campaign " ... ... without ever bothering to check out if that was actually the case when the call ratios are so very far off of what Americans have actually stated that they wanted .
First check the possibility .
Then verify any results .
And then make sure that the ... " moderate " ...
House Dems understand that it wo n't be the wingnut phone calls that will be throwing their asses out of Congress at the next primary if they bend over for Bush again .

Loosely connected 91 - 1 info for those interested .
237 nuke handling deficiencies cited since 2001 now some quotes from article ...
" The response he received went only as far back as June 2001 because the ACC Safety database no longer has any records of Dull Sword incidents from 1992 to 2001 , said Maj .
Thomas Crosson , an ACC spokesman .
Air Force officials could not explain why those incidents got deleted from the database . "
" Dull Sword is a term used by the Defense Department to describe a nuclear incident like Bent Spear , Broken Arrow and Nucflash .
A Nucflash , which is a nuclear weapons accident that could create the risk of war , is the most extreme .
A Broken Arrow is an accident that is not expected to cause war .
A Bent Spear is typified by a “ significant incident ” involving nuclear weapons , according to Air Force Policy Directive 91 - 1 . "
" The 509th Bomb Wing which operates the B - 2 Spirit bomber at Whiteman Air Force Base , Mo. , alone recorded 111 of the 237 safety deficiencies , by far the most for one wing .
Meanwhile , the 5th Bomb Wing , the one responsible for mistakenly loading the six nuclear warheads had 45 incidents and the 2nd Bomb Wing at Barksdale had 50 . "
" Minot airmen with the 5th Bomb Wing loaded a dozen AGM - 129 cruise missiles to the wings of a B - 52 on the morning of Aug. 29 without realizing six of the missiles were loaded with nuclear warheads .
The B - 52 sat on the runway without special nuclear guard until it took off the next morning and landed at Barksdale when an airman with the 2nd Bomb Wing discovered the mistake nearly 36 hours after it was made . "
" The opening statements , along with at least the first round of questions , will be open to the public .
But the rest of the hearing will be closed . " and yes that was " Air Force Policy Directive 91 - 1 " coincidence abound ...

FYI :
“ This , I believe , is the right way to go for the security of the nation , ” said Senator John D. Rockefeller , the West Virginia Democrat who leads the intelligence committee .
His support for the plan , after intense negotiations with the White House and his Republican colleagues , was considered critical to its passage but drew criticism from civil liberties groups because of $ 42,000 in contributions that Mr. Rockefeller received last year from AT&T and Verizon executives .

the zapkitty # 14 Indeed .
Speaking of conspiracy theories , Sibel does not believe the bushie WTC 7 , 1 & 2 conspiracy theory .
A few days ago an engineer who designed and worked on components of the WTC for 35 years joins Sibel in doubting bushie conspiracy theories :
I was Senior Project Design Engineer in charge of the design of the electrical systems for the WTC Complex in NY .
Employed by the consulting and engineering firm , Joseph R. Loring & Associates , Inc. , I was also a licensed Professional Engineer and was directly associated with ongoing projects at WTC for some 35 years before retiring in mid 1997 .
Though an electrical engineer by trade , I was also very familiar with the structures and their conceptual design parameters .
( His Bio ) .
Wow this guy is not a nut , but he does not believe the bushie version of reality .
Here is what he says :
On September 11 , I watched the live TV broadcast of the progressive collapse of the World Trade Towers with disbelief , as the mass and strength of the structure should have survived the localized damage caused by the planes and burning jet fuel .
I viewed the presentation of Richard Gage and other related material , which compels me to believe that the fuel and planes alone did not bring the Towers down .
I , therefore , support the proposal to form an international group of professionals to investigate all plausible causes for the virtual freefall and the almost total destruction of the WTC structures .
( ibid. , emphasis added ) .
Is an infection growing or is the truth growing ?
My opinion is that the bushies are more likely to be lying than hundreds of competent pilots , engineers and architects , professors , military experts , and others .
Keep up the good work Sibel .

( Last FISA interuption ... and my belated apologies to those following the Wilson and Edmonds threads . )
An attempt to hijack the House 's proposed " Protect America Act " extension and ram through the Senate FISA abortion in its stead was foiled tonight by Representative Conyers and House parliamentarians .
In the House Rep . Conyers called non-germane on a " Bush Dog " - led attempt to hijack the House PAA extension bill via an amendment substituting the text of the Senate FISA bill instead .
When the matter was voted on the House found that the amendment was indeed not germane to the bill .
Whereupon a weird combination of Republicans , Bush Dogs , and progressives voted to kill the PAA extension altogether .
The progressives know that the PAA is an atrocious law that was never really needed in the first place ... and the R's and the dogs just want to terrify the House Dems into submission with another " terrorists will eat you " time squeeze .
Therefore ... barring Pelosi , Hoyer , and Rahm egging each other on into another capitulation ... when the PAA expires this weekend the original and still perfectly good FISA law will be in effect again .
Keep calling ... especially the Bush Dogs .
Be firm and polite but do n't let the dogs ' various staff lie to you about " not knowing " where their bosses stand on this issue .
They know ... and so do you .
And when you get an answer one way or the other explain to the staffer that all too many Senators are now on record as having lied to their constituents while simultaneously caving in n FISA ... so gently ask the staffers if they are sure that their principal is n't lying at this time .
When the staffer answers you can politly agree with them ... the question serves to get the point across that you will remember any betrayal .

The blue bush dogs in the House could not get the retroactive telecom immunity into the bill days ago before the Senate began the current FISA vote , so it is not logical yet to think just because they are fascists that they will be able to now .
There is only one less vote since Lantos died yesterday .
The House already voted the retroactive immunity provision down before , and there is every reason to have the audacity of hope that they will again .
Keep hope alive !!!

The revelation of the outing of Brewster Jennings back in 2001 validates many of my postings and op - eds in where I claim that the Wilson Smear story was nothing but Rovian spin to distract from the destruction of Brewster Jennings .
The entire Wilson ' Smear ' angle was a set up from the start to create the excuse of the outing as being an effort to discredit Wilson .
The main stream media ( and most bloggers ) swallowed and regurgitated this bullshit from the start and never once questioned this bogus story and excuse even though it originated from the WH .
From the start Rove / Bush wanted ethical Plame out of there so they could lie with impunity about Iran when the time came ... which is now .

RE # 23 and the republican troll ... Valerie and Sibel , stay away from McPain ...
The preznit blush has threatened to veto any bill that limits or forbids water torture a.k.a. waterboarding .
So the conference committee reviewing the FISA bill ( HR 2082 ) , after it passed the Senate 68 - 29 , attached a provision that forbids water torture .
McCain voted against the provision but the Senate passed it anyway .
If the preznit blush vetoes it he will veto the spy on america act and the retroactive immunity for telecoms provisions in the act .
My guess is that if the conference bill gets thru the House , preznit blush will add a signing statement saying he will obey those parts he wants to and not obey the rest , instead of vetoing it as he promised .
As usual for this " law and order " preznit blush .

According to comments at various blogs last nights victory may have been just for show as well ... because at 4 pm yesterday the House Rules Committee passed a resolution setting up special rules just for Thursday , February 14 , 2008 specific to a " bill addressing foreign intelligence surveillance " ...
It 's a very unusual type of rule and was last seen being used to ram an unamended version of the Senate 's original PAA act through the House ( when the Senate did the cave 'n ' bail and left the House with no time to debate the issue ) .. ... and it could be used to either ram through an unneeded but face - saving PAA extension today ... or to ram through an unamended Senate FISA bill today .

Excellent post .
Sibel Edmonds has snared one tentacle of the octopus that has been dealing in narcotics , nuclear secrets , and illegal weapons sales for decades .
The blog Antifascist Calling has just posted another very detailed piece on this international criminal network , titled Deep State , Corporate Crime .
It 's a must - read .
Also , do n't miss Key Clinton Backer Guilty in Sibel Edmonds Case at the blog Let Sibel Edmonds Speak .
The term " deep state " refers to a political system , composed of high - level elements within the military , security and intelligence services , the judicial branch , and important commanders of organized crime .
Although the term originated to describe Turkey 's political system , it also correctly describes the USA , Great Britain , Pakistan , Israel , and others from roughly the 1970s through today .
A peek at the ATC board members listed in Deep State , Corporate Crime gives one an idea of the numerous players who benefit politically and financially from deep state politics .
Keep in mind the ATC board is one of hundreds of deep state lobbies and CIA cutouts created to carry out ilegal and deadly deep state activities .
Deep state activities during the 1970s and 1980s are well documented , though higly complex .
The now defunct bank BCCI was one of the primary institutions used to launder the money used in this illegal narcotics , nuclear , and weapons trade .
Although it is well - known that BCCI functioned as the CIA 's money - laundering facility , Democratic Senator John Kerry helped whitewash the CIA 's connections to BCCI during the investigations of the failed bank 's criminal activities during poppy Bush ’s presidency .
While the Bush crime family is well - known , with poppy Bush a former CIA chief , and generations of war profiteering and graft , the role of the Clinton crime family in deep state politics is more well - hidden .
Here are a few of Clinton ’s connections to the 1990s deep state .
Support of the terrorist Kosovo Liberation Army , well - known for heroin trafficking , and the war on Serbia to ensure a secure flow of heroin from Turkey to western Europe is one .
Another is the assistance governor Clinton provided to help cover for the CIA ’s cocaine trafficking into Mena , AK .
One of the best summaries of Bill Clinton ’s connections to deep state politics is in this chart ( top of page ) , depicting the relationships various Clinton associate had to BCCI , and this compilation of sales and thefts of weapons techology to China .
To learn more about the USA 's deep state activities prior to 1990 , start with The Politics of Heroin ; CIA Complicity In The Global Drug Trade by Alfred McCoy , The Last Circle by Carolyn Marshall , and books by Peter Dale Scott .
It ’s a steep learning curve to bring oneself up to speed on decades of CIA and deep state criminal activity , but it is crucial to know the context of Sibel Edmonds ’ revelations , 9 - 11 , and the threat posed by unaccountable intelligence agencies that also control much of the world ’s narcotics and illegal weapons trade .
The threat posed to democratic societies , and the world in general , by intelligence agencies run amok makes CIA asset al Qaeda look like a cuddy teddy bear .
The war on terror is a mere cover for the profits and operations of those who control deep state politics .

Following Barack Obama 's speech yesterday the media has been dissecting every syllable and nuance .
Reactions have been mixed and the right is now trying to portray Obama as " the black candidate " who just wants to blame whitey .
That 's why it comes as no surprise that right wing tool , Joe Scarborough , ca n't stop talking about Obama and Reverend Wright and has now picked up the Free Republic line on the speech -- how dare he say ANYTHING bad about his grandmother !
" I really wonder why anybody , why any man would throw his grandmother under the bus during a political speech , regardless of the point he was trying to make . "
Now that Tucker no longer has his own show , Joe has taken on the role of wingnut concern troll and on this morning 's Morning Joe , he was in rare form .
He kept saying over and over how Obama 's speech was one of the greatest speeches on race ever , then can't shut up about how white folk in Ohio and Pennsylvania will never buy into it .
It 's true , some people were n't impressed with the speech , but Joe constantly yammers on about how Obama supporters are all latte - sipping yuppies from midtown Manhattan and Georgetown , which is patently false .
Will Bunch asks if we 're ready for Obama 's post - racial politics v.2.0 .
Given Scarborough 's remarks , I 'm not so sure .
Pam Spaulding hopes so :
The all - electric Lightning GT might just be the world 's first green supercar .
It 's as clean as the Tesla Roadster , as quick as the Porsche 911 GT3 RS and as pricey as the Lamborghini Murcielago LP640 .
The Lightning Motor Co. is Britain 's equivalent to Tesla Motors – a small company that believes electric vehicles are the future and the best way to sell them is to make them as fast as they are sexy .
" Without a significant positive shift in perception , " the company says , " electric motoring will remain a large compromise in the eyes of driving enthusiasts and therefore fail to impress the masses . "
The Lightning is impressive indeed .
The company says four in - wheel motors generate 553 lb- ft of torque – that 's about as much as the tire - shredding Dodge Viper SRT produces – and 120 kilowatts apiece ( for a combined total of about 643
horsepower , putting it in the same ballpark as the Corvette ZR1 ) .
Lightning claims the car will do 0 to 60 in 4.0 seconds and hit a top speed of 130 mph .
Range is 250 miles .
The car features an aluminum honeycomb chassis , carbon - kevlar bodywork , regenerative braking and 36 kilowatt nano lithium titanate battery the company says will charge in just
10 minutes and maintain 85 percent capacity after 15,000 charges .
Look for a full slate of features , from anti-lock braking and traction control to air conditioning and leather .
What 's all this speed and luxury cost ?
Almost $ 300,000 .
Lightning seems serious about building the car .
It 's spent the past two years refining the design and lining up suppliers like Altairnano and PML Flightlink to provide the batteries and motors , respectively .
Altairnano 's Nanosafe batteries power the world 's fastest EV dragster , and Volvo is using PML's Hi-Pa drive wheel motors in its ReCharge plug - in hybrid concept , so there 's no question the hardware works .
But as Tesla has shown , building a car from scratch is no easy feat , and Lightning 's got its work cut out for it .
We 'll keep you posted .
「そんなことは絶対に無理。私が何年も挑戦してきた（のに成しえなかった）のだから」―Sun Microsystems のJonathan Schwartz CEOは、同社のソフトウェア・エグゼクティブ・バイス・プレジデントRich Green氏が最初 にSchwartz CEOに対してMySQLを買収すべきだと主張したとき、こう答えたという。16日の買収発表にコメントする形で19日に自身のブログで告白している。
Schwartz CEO自身、MySQL は「たったひとつだけ許されるなら、是非とも買収したい対象」と考えていたという。同氏はMySQLのMarten Mickos CEO と 「業界事情にキャッチアップし、トレンドやビジネスモデルについて雑談するために」食事を繰り返していた。この席で何となく切り出した「MySQLとSunは共通点も多いし、Sunの一部になるって考えてみないか？」という提案は見事に無視された。「喜んだり光栄だとかいうべきタイミングで、彼はコーヒーにミルクを注ぎ、混ぜ、フィンランドの話を始めた」（フィンランドはMySQLの故郷だ）。
こういう経緯もあっ てSchwartz CEOは絶対に無理と考えていたようだ。しかし、Green氏の意向もあり、12月はじめにもう一度会食をセッティング、また、そのときは前回と同じ流でフィンランドの話になり、「スルー」されている。
しかし、その会食の翌朝 、Mickos CEO側から買収について話し合いたいという電話がかかってきた。―これがMySQL買収の事の起こりとなる。Schwartz氏による多少の脚色はあるだろうが、おもしろいストーリーだ。「
In a Vortex（たつ巻のなかで）」と題されたブログエントリーでは今後MySQL以外のデータベースへのコミットを続けることなども解説されているが、このあたりはbuilderの先日の記事とおおむね同じ内容なので省略させていただく。
I want to sincerely thank the military heroes who -- even right now -- may be thwarting another false flag attack in America .
By way of background , I read with gratitude that the " CENTCOM Commander ’s Veto Sank Bush ’s Threatening Gulf Buildup " .
And I also believe that good people in the military -- who love this country and the Constitution -- have thwarted some of the neocon 's other crazy plans .
someone blew the whistle on
As some have reported ,
And the
.
Thank you to the anonymous hero who blew the whistle and stopped whatever dark deed was being planned .
And the Pentagon put a stop to Cheney 's plans to bomb Iran in summer 2007 .
For example ,
So to the behind - the - scenes heroes who are " just saying no " to senseless war or another false flag attack . . .
Thank You .
I 'm just a civilian , and I do n't know what it is like to stand in your shoes .
But I do know that the people of good faith in the military can save our country from dictatorship , poverty , and despair by preventing " another 9/11 " ; that is , an attack by elements of our very own government .

As the ugly reality of what we had gotten ourselves into in Iraq settled on the national consciousness , like a viral infection settling on the lungs , the conventional wisdom was that the authors of this war  the political tendency known as the neoconservatives  were utterly and completely discredited .
Where were the " weapons of mass destruction " ?
Where were the crowds of Iraqis throwing rose petals in our wake ?
Where was the cakewalk ?
And  most of all  where were the friggin ’ neocons , anyway ?
Most were in hiding , having resigned and slunk back to academia or some neocon " think tank " ; very few were in the line of fire .
They left that one for the troops .
Suddenly , once - ubiquitous figures such as Richard Perle , James Woolsey , and Kenneth Adelman , who had made the television talking - heads circuit pretty regularly in the run-up to war , were nowhere to be seen .
The neocons vanished from the corridors of power or else took cover in unlighted alcoves .
Paul Wolfowitz , Douglas Feith , Perle , and a large number of their retainers left government or  like Scooter Libby and Larry Franklin  were indicted .
The neocons , we were told , had been " marginalized , " and their dreams of " benevolent global hegemony " were pronounced dead .
Yet , not much more than a year later , the beast has reawakened ; the corpse is animate .
Frankenstein lives !
As Jacob Heilbrunn , a senior editor at The National Interest , a former neocon himself , and author of They Knew They Were Right : The Rise of the Neocons , put it the other day , the idea that the neoconservatives are finished " could be the biggest whopper of them all . "
With the " surge " in place , its ostensible success having placated the mainstream media ( if not the American public ) , " the neocons are already claiming vindication , " avers Heilbrunn .
And they ’re flocking to John McCain ’s presidential bid , which seems to have escaped any opprobrium on account of his pro-war position simply because the mainstream media have resumed their love affair with the conductor of the " Straight Talk Express . "
And so have the neocons : Heilbrunn refers to McCain as " the neocons ’ hero , " as well he ought to be .
He is , after all , the perfect exemplar of militarism , American - style .
With McCain in the White House , it will be just like old times again , only better .
Do n’t forget that McCain was one of Ahmed Chalabi ’s biggest backers and openly campaigned , during the Clinton administration , to put the Iraqi fraudster on the American payroll .
During the 1990s , when most Republican politicians were against nation - building and extravagant interventionism  perhaps in reaction to the Clinton administration ’s taste for both  McCain , in the words of John Judis , sought " to differentiate his views from those of other Republican presidential aspirants and from the growing isolationism of House Republicans " from " within a larger ideological framework .
That ideological framework was neoconservatism . "
The Weekly Standard became McCain ’s Pravda , and he began consulting regularly with Bill Kristol , who soon became a close adviser .
Neocons Marshall Wittmann and Daniel McKivergan  two close friends of Kristol ’s  were hired by McCain , and the former became one of his top advisers during the presidential campaign .
The neocons , having destroyed the presidency of George W. Bush , have already found another willing host , and they are primed and ready for another go .
As Heilbrunn knowingly , and somewhat wearily , puts it :
" The truth is that the neocons have been repeatedly declared dead before  and , to the chagrin of their enemies on the left and the right , bounced back .
At the end of the Cold War , the arch - realist George H.W. Bush relegated them to the sidelines ; then the triangulating Bill Clinton seemed to deprive them of their biggest foreign and domestic policy issues .
If they came back from that , they can come back from anything .
Now that Robert Kagan , William Kristol ( who seems not to be discredited in the eyes of the New York Times , which just made him a columnist ) and a host of other neocons have hitched their fortunes to McCain , the neocons are poised for a fresh comeback .
If they make a hash of foreign policy by 2011 , perhaps the familiar cycle of public scorn and rebirth might even start all over again . "
Ah yes , the familiar cycle of public scorn and rebirth : like the panorama of the seasons  winter , spring , summer , and fall .
Heilbrunn makes it all sound so natural .
Yet there is something unnatural and downright creepy about this tale of eternal recurrence : how could it be that a political sect that has wreaked such damage on America ’s national interests , and taken so many lives , manages to get off not only scot - free , but lives to fight another day ?
Two reasons , in my opinion : oodles of money , and an apparent ability to quash investigations that might have put a few more besides Libby and Franklin behind bars .
The financial factor is a major plus for the neocons .
Paul Gottfried and others have already documented how Irving Kristol , Bill ’s father , made the necessary contacts with old conservative money and transformed relatively staid philanthropists of a right - wing disposition into ATM machines for the exclusive use of neoconservative ideologues .
By driving out all their ideological competition on the Right , monopolizing the institutions of the contemporary conservative movement , and transforming those institutions to suit their own purposes , the neocons pulled off a coup d’etat that eventually gave them near total hegemony over the American Right .
A nationwide network of neocon operatives in the media , academia , and government was created by this burgeoning apparatus and soon took on a political dimension , with McCain being one of the most prominent Republican politicians Kristol & Co. acquired during the 1990s .
The immunity factor is harder to explain , yet there it is , staring us in the face .
Of course , this is nothing new : the neocons have always veered toward criminality , as the Iran - Contra scandal showed .
But they mostly managed to stay out of the Big House .
How Michael Ledeen , for example , avoided a jail term for his activities in setting up the arms - for - hostages deal , in clear contravention of American law , is not known .
Equally murky are the more recent shenanigans of this troublesome sect .
To take just one example : the neocons ’
Che Guevara , Chalabi , is known to have passed vital U.S. secrets to the Iranians , most probably with the active collaboration of his American fan club , yet neither Chalabi nor his neocon handlers seem to have suffered any consequences , legal or otherwise , other than some initial embarrassment .
The whole thing soon blew over , as the " investigation " by the FBI into Chalabi ’s activities was quietly killed .
Do n’t imagine for a moment that a changing of the guard in Washington will keep the neocon foxes out of the proverbial hen - house .
You ’ll recall that back when the Republicans controlled Congress , the then - chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee , Pat Roberts , was blamed for stalling the famous " phase two " of the committee ’s investigation into the intelligence that told us Saddam Hussein was harboring " weapons of mass destruction . "
This investigation was supposed to tell us if the administration had deliberately misled Congress and the American people into believing what turned out to be a pack of lies  but the Democrats could always point to GOP control of the process and throw their hands up in despair .
However , now that the Democrats control Congress , has the much - vaunted " phase two " been launched ?
No way , José .
If and when the Democrats take the White House , you can bet your bottom dollar the neocons will have some kind of presence , whether it ’s in the form of a few mid-level bureaucrats placed in sensitive positions or in top spots close to President Hillary or Obama .
They ’re already crawling all over the DLC , and they ’ll find their way into a Democratic White House via the interstices between pure politics and policy wonkery .
If the Republicans manage to overcome the odds , and McCain winds up in the White House , the neocons will be back  and with a vengeance .
Like vampires risen from the dead each night , these creatures who shun the light and feast on pain and suffering , are refreshed and ready to take wing again .
What they seek is what makes them feel alive and energizes them to want more , and that is war .
They are the War Party , and they are Democrats and Republicans .
They are columnists and publishers and academics , as well as politicians and publicists .
They do n’t have much of a mass base : they prefer to work in the shadows , manipulating rather than inspiring .
By such Machiavellian means have they managed to stay viable , in spite of the disasters they have wrought through the years  giving them more scope for fresh disasters yet to be imagined .
NOTES IN THE MARGIN
Please , please , please say it ai n’t so !
What am I talking about ?
I ’m talking about our current fundraising campaign , which is now in full - swing  although " full " and " swing " are not exactly descriptive of what is actually happening on that score .
After two full days of " pledge week , " we ’ve got something like $ 10,000 in contributions  an indication that , just like last time , we ’ll be forced to extend the fundraising campaign for another full week .
Please , please , puh - leeeze do n’t make us do this , or , rather , do n’t make me do this : we hate the interruption , you hate the interruption , and it means a whole lot of extra work for poor little old me , who has been locked up in his office banging away at fundraising copy for a week , and sick as a dog with the worst winter cold in memory .
I have now completely lost my ability to speak  yes , I can hear certain people laughing !
You know who you are !
 and I am literally swooning and covered in sweat even as I write this .
If I have to endure much more of this , they ’ll be carrying me away on a stretcher .
So , c’mon , you guys : stop throwing your money at useless political campaigns that are n’t going to stop the neocons from carrying out their rotten warmongering agenda in any event , and send some cash our way .
Otherwise , we ’ll be hectoring you for weeks on end , and it is n’t going to be pretty .

PRESS RELEASE :
UPDATED 'KNIGHT RIDER ' REVS UP TO RETURN TO NBC FOR SPECIAL TWO - HOUR MOVIE EVENT ON FEBRUARY 17 AS NEW KITT CAR IS REVEALED
BURBANK , Calif . - December 12 , 2007 - As " Knight Rider " -- NBC 's iconic 1980s television classic that became a runaway success , comes roaring back to life on the network with an updated sequel that will air as a two - hour movie event on Sunday , February 17 ( 9- 11 p.m. ET ) -- NBC unveiled the new customized KITT Ford Mustang to be featured in the series in a press event held at NBC's Burbank Studios today .
The movie stars Justin Bruening ( " Cold Case , " " All My Children " ) , Deanna Russo ( " NCIS , " " The Young and the Restless " ) , Sydney Tamiia Poitier ( " Veronica Mars , " " Grindhouse " ) and Bruce Davison ( " Breach , " " Close to Home " ) .
In addition , David Hasselhoff ( NBC's " America 's Got Talent " ) -- who starred in the popular lead role as Michael Knight for four seasons during the original series -- returns as the same character in a special guest - star appearance .
Will Arnett ( NBC 's " 30 Rock , " " Blades of Glory " ) will provide the voice of KITT .
Dave Bartis ( " Heist , " " The O.C. " ) and Doug Liman ( " Mr. and Mrs. Smith , " " The Bourne Identity " ) serve as executive producers .
NBC also has an arrangement with Ford Motor Company that provides for a unique content opportunity that makes the Ford Mustang one of the stars of the movie .
The three cars to be employed in the series include the KITT Hero -- a Ford Mustang Shelby GT500KR that is playing the part of the everyday Hero car with 540 horsepower ; the KITT Attack -- a super high - speed version of the Ford Mustang Shelby GT500KR
Hero car that transforms into Attack mode with the help of air - ride technology and specialized body parts -- and a KITT Remote , which is a driverless Ford Mustang Shelby GT500KR version of the Hero vehicle .
As the original story resumes , the new KITT ( Knight Industries Three Thousand ) is absolutely the coolest car ever created : its supercomputer capable of hacking almost any system ; its weapons systems efficient ; and its body -- thanks to its creator 's work and nanotechnology -- is capable of actually shifting shape and color .
Plus , its artificial intelligence makes it the ideal crime - fighting partner : logical , precise and possessing infinite knowledge .
It is the ultimate car -- and someone will be willing to do anything to obtain it .
Sarah Graiman is a 24 - year old Ph.D candidate at Stanford University , following in her genius father Charles ' ( Davison ) footsteps .
But when men attempt to abduct her , Sarah receives a mysterious call from KITT warning her that he 's a creation of Charles , who also invented the first KITT 25 years ago -- and that her father is in serious danger .
Sarah and KITT track down her best friend from childhood , Mike Tracer ( Bruening ) , a 23 - year - old ex-Army Ranger , whom Sarah has n't seen since he left home at 18 .
Having served in Iraq , Mike is now jaded and lost and initially resistant .
Eventually he agrees to help Sarah and the two set out to discover who 's behind the attempt to procure KITT and find Charles .
Along the way , Carrie Rivai ( Poitier ) plays the agile yet tough FBI agent who has a long - standing friendship with Charles and Sarah .
Due to those ties , she is brought into the mix to help in the search .
David Andron is supervising producer and writer .
Steve Shill ( " Dexter , " " The Tudors " ) , also a co-executive producer , directs the two - hour movie from Universal Media Studios and Dutch Oven Productions .
The speech Senator Barack Obama delivered Tuesday morning has been viewed more than 1.6 million times on YouTube and is being widely e-mailed .
While commentators and politicians debated its political success Wednesday , some around the country were responding to Mr. Obama ’s call for a national conversation about race .
Religious groups and academic bodies , already receptive to Mr. Obama ’s plea for such a dialogue , seemed especially enthusiastic .
Universities were moving to incorporate the issues Mr. Obama raised into classroom discussions and course work , and churches were trying to find ways to do the same in sermons and Bible studies .
The Rev. Joel Hunter , senior pastor of a mostly white evangelical church of about 12,000 in Central Florida , described Mr. Obama ’s speech , in which the Democratic presidential candidate discussed his relationship with the former pastor of his home church in Chicago , as a kind of “ Rorschach inkblot test ” for the nation .
“ It calls out of you what is already in you , ” Dr. Hunter said , predicting that those desiring to address the topic would regard the speech as a spur , while those indifferent to issues of race might pay it little heed .

In spite of all he has endured , Frank Gardner retains his BBC voice - clear , measured , concise , registering on my old tape recorder perfectly through the din of helicopters and passenger jets passing over the cafe where we meet .
His wheelchair is pulled up to the table .
He has put back a little of the weight he lost in hospital .
It 's a glorious early spring day , in a pleasant spot , 10 months after he was shot , but on his face , almost all the time , apart from the occasional smile , is an expression of frowning concentration , such as you see on the face of TV reporters who are first on the scene of a terrible disaster .
It is quite unaffected : Gardner is still reporting from inside himself , from the war which entered him last summer , scene of his grief at the death of his colleague Simon Cumbers , his anger towards the killers , and the physical destruction of his body , which goes on causing him pain - pain that can't be eased without punishing side effects .
" I just think it 's cowardice to shoot somebody who 's defenceless .
That is n't brave , that 's not making a stand for your beliefs , that 's just cowardice .
What kind of a battle is that ?
It 's one thing for them to be taking on the police in a shootout , but taking on a couple of unarmed , defenceless journalists ? "
There were times when Gardner and Cumbers would feel nervous about where they were going , but June 6 2004 , in Riyadh , Saudi Arabia , was n't one of them .
The district of the Saudi capital they were visiting had , it is true , been the scene of a shootout between security forces and Islamist fundamentalist militants six months earlier - that was why the two BBC men were going , to film some general footage of the area - but they did n't feel they were taking a risk .
This was n't Fallujah , or some Taliban stronghold in southern Afghanistan .
This was neat , rich , outwardly modern , usually safe Riyadh .
Gardner , the BBC 's security correspondent , a fluent Arab speaker at home in the Gulf , and Cumbers , an experienced cameraman , had waited for permission from the Saudi ministry of information before going .
They even had a government minder with them , and a government driver in a government van .
It was their last job , on the last day of their assignment to Saudi .
Their flights to London were booked for the next day .
In war zones , journalists on their final day tend to get jumpy but this was n't a war zone .
The only anxiety left was over the story - had they got good material ?
- blending with warm anticipation of going home .
Gardner and Cumbers reached the area in the late afternoon .
" It looked a completely normal Gulf residential suburb ... peachy coloured villas , bougainvillea coming down the walls , very average , a couple of kids playing in the street , nobody suspicious lurking in doorways and whispering or anything like that , " says Gardner .
They filmed for half an hour , and prepared to leave .
Cumbers was taking his camera off its tripod .
They might as well have been on the plane home already .
Gardner registered a car parking a short distance away , but it did n't come to a halt with a screech of tires and brakes .
It parked quietly .
The banal sound of car doors , the two nondescript young men strolling towards them in ordinary white Saudi tunics : at first Gardner assumed they were friends of the driver .
Too late , as the men advanced , Gardner understood .
One of them - a beardless , completely average young man , in Gardner 's description - took out a pistol .
" I shouted , in Arabic , stupidly : ' No , do n't do this ! ' as soon as I saw him pulling out the pistol , " says Gardner .
" He was probably 30 metres from me and I took off at once - and I presume Simon ran at the same time .
We ran in different directions .
We had no time to make a plan . "
Gardner ran from the gunman , deeper into the district .
He heard a shot and something stung his shoulder .
A bullet had passed through him .
He kept running .
There were more shots .
He was hit in the leg , his leg bone was fractured , and he fell , on a patch of waste ground .
" The adrenalin was really pumping so initially the shooting did n't hurt .
It felt like a massive thump .
With each bullet that went in it was like being picked up by a giant hand and slammed on the ground . "
Still , these were not deadly wounds .
He would have made a full recovery .
But the militants were n't finished .
A second vehicle drew up alongside him , a cargo van .
Gardner found himself looking up into the side doorway of the van where three militants crouched , looking at him .
One of them was pointing a pistol .
" I pleaded with them in Arabic not to shoot me , " says Gardner .
" They had a very quick discussion among themselves .
I could n't pick up what they were saying .
Then they emptied the pistol into me at pretty much point - blank range . "
Four 9 mm bullets smashed into Gardner 's spinal nerves , pelvis and abdomen .
Gardner remembers the expression on the face of the man who shot him .
" It was a sneer .
It was a sneer of contempt , of hatred .
Maybe he saw in me President Bush , Tony Blair , Ariel Sharon , Donald Rumsfeld , all rolled into one .
I do n't know .
He did n't see me as a non-partisan reporter who 's simply just trying to report what 's going on .
He saw me as the enemy . "
Gardner found himself lying on his front , amazed to be still alive and conscious .
He closed his eyes and pretended to be dead .
He heard the feet of one of the militants walking around him and prepared to die .
" I thought this is it , this is going to be the execution shot in the back of the head . "
He felt the gunman rooting in his back trouser pockets .
In one , he found Cumbers ' radio mike .
In the other he found a miniature Qur'an of the kind Gardner often gave out as gifts .
That discovery , Gardner believes , may have saved his life , by giving the killer pause for thought .
The militants drove off , leaving him bleeding in the dust .
Gardner rolled over and cried for help .
His legs were paralysed .
" My cries were just a sort of animal pain ... it was almost beyond pain .
I 'm amazed I did n't black out .
Maybe some of the stomach acid had leaked , I do n't know . "
The locals who gathered at the scene astonished Gardner by their behaviour .
It was as if , by being shot , he had put himself in a world beyond them .
" They did n't help at all .
To me this was extraordinary , they offered no reassurance , no glass of water , no blanket , no cushion , nothing .
They were discussing the cartridge cases around .
They were saying , ' Look , I think he 's been shot , has he been shot , yes , he has , look at the bullet cases there , ' as if I was just an exhibit in a museum .
It was bizarre because I 've had so much hospitality in the Middle East , so much kindness . "
Instead of an ambulance , two police cars arrived .
He was manhandled into the back of one of them and driven off , screaming in pain , to hospital .
" It took them a long time to get me out of the police car and on to a hospital trolley , there was pulling and pushing and arguing .
I remember them wheeling me into the operating theatre and me shouting for painkiller and somebody injected me - and then I was out and I did n't come back up for eight days . "
When he woke up , he saw his wife , Amanda .
" It was fantastic to sort of swim up the surface of consciousness and open my eyes and see her there and although I was pretty groggy I asked a number of questions .
I said : ' What 's happened to Simon ? '
And she said : ' He did n't make it . ' "
Cumbers , Gardner found out later , ran at right angles to him .
He managed to run for about a kilometre , carrying his heavy Betacam camera , but could n't find any cover .
The militants shot him in the head .
In his eight days of drug - induced unconsciousness , Gardner himself came close to death .
The first team of surgeons was well - intentioned but inexperienced .
While they tried to patch him up , bullet hole by bullet hole , his life was slipping away .
Two things saved him .
One was that the governor of Riyadh heard what had happened and dispatched an emergency team , with a mobile intensive - care unit , from one of the city 's best hospitals , the King Faisal .
The other was that the team was led by a South African , Peter Bautz , who happened to specialise in gunshot wounds .
Bautz 's team operated on Gardner for the next 40 hours as he went in and out of surgery .
They operated on his stomach so many times - nine - that they did n't even close it up between operations , just kept it covered .
" My intestines were very shot up , they had to take out quite a lot of them , there was internal bleeding , there was pus , fecal matter in there , there were infections , I had acute lead poisoning from one of the bullets .
Dr Bautz told me one bullet went in , out and in again , somehow .
So I was in quite a state . "
This was the beginning of a medical ordeal that continues .
The Saudis paid for Gardner 's air ambulance back to Britain .
Months of operations and recovery followed at the Royal London - where , despite superb care from a constellation of specialists , Gardner endured weeks of fever and vomiting as the result of infection from a feeding tube - and the Chelsea and Westminster .
Incredibly , his major organs - liver , kidney , lungs , liver , stomach , heart - are relatively undamaged , and he now digests his food .
He has lost part of his colon and his intestines , but has been told that he can do without them .
His shoulder and leg wounds have healed .
Even his spine is largely intact .
Yet none of this is much comfort to Gardner and his family , because he still cannot walk , and will never fully recover the use of his legs .
The militant 's bullets severely damaged the cascade of nerves connecting the spine with the legs .
Some were cut , and they do n't grow back .
Gardner has not experienced any of the symptoms of post - traumatic stress as a result of the horror he experienced .
All his troubles now are related to being suddenly thrust into the ranks of Britain 's estimated 40,000 spinal cord injury sufferers .
" The most stressful thing is coping with being disabled .
Spinal injury is a complete life changer , " he says .
" There is life before the injury and life afterwards and in a way that has dwarfed the horror of what happened . "
After the attack , when he was lying in the dirt , says Gardner , " I never reconciled myself to dying , no , absolutely not .
I never , ever thought this is all too difficult , I 'll just give up and die .
Quite the opposite .
It was thoughts of my family that kept me going .
I love my family so much I want to carry on being a father and a husband to them . "
Now the family - Gardner and his wife have two daughters , aged six and seven - are reunited , and it has been hard .
" My wife has just been an amazing support , she has been so understanding .
She married an able - bodied person and she 's now got a disabled husband .
That 's tough for her as well .
Physically , I 've gone from being a runner who 's quite robust to being somebody who's in a wheelchair and quite vulnerable , essentially . "
And the children ?
" The younger one has taken it in her stride , I think she 's fine .
The older one , it 's been quite tough for her .
She was very shocked when it happened , she was wandering round the playground in a daze .
She was asking , ' Why did n't they shoot daddy with a water pistol ?
Why did it have to be bullets ? '
For a six year old , as she was last year , she should n't be having to ask questions like that , she should n't even know what a bullet is .
" They 're much better now that I 'm back home .
I was away in hospital for seven or eight months .
At least now I 'm able to read them their bedtime story every night .
The tough thing is that I was very physical with them before .
Particularly with the older one .
I 'd take her rock climbing and teach her rollerblading and take them swimming every weekend ...
I 'm getting stronger , but when I first came back from my operation in January I would eat a few morsels of food and then have to go and lie down feeling sick .
So I 've not had the same energy and dynamism that I had before .
But I 'm having to find new things to do with them , like chess .
They both love chess . "
Gardner 's fascination with the Arab world , which took him around the Middle East as an investment banker and , since 1995 , as a BBC journalist , began when he was 16 .
His mother took him to meet a friend , the late Wilfred Thesiger , the writer and explorer who had lived among the Arabs of the Empty Quarter in Arabia and the marshes of Iraq .
Sitting in Thesiger 's little flat in Chelsea , drinking tea , the young Gardner was not put off by the veteran 's disgust with the modernisation of the oil - era Middle East .
He was inspired by Thesiger 's pictures and stories from the older Arab milieux of the 1940s and 1950s , and resolved to become an Arabist .
He read Arabic and Islamic studies at Exeter , but found the academic course tough going .
It was only when the university sent him to Cairo for a year that he blossomed .
He stopped going to classes , moved in with an Egyptian family in one of the city 's medieval slums , and acquired fluent Arabic .
A few years later he spent time living with the Bedu in Jordan , in the desert near Aqaba .
" By day I would go out with the shepherds and we 'd wander for miles with the goats and sheep over the dunes , drinking goat 's milk , but then when it was Ramadan we had to fast , and I fasted with them , and at night there would be these huge feasts , tribes would come from all around ... it was a wonderful time .
They would tell stories under the stars and somebody would play a rababo , a stringed instrument that makes a very mournful sound , and then somebody would recite traditional poetry .
" Since then I 've made many Arab friends , mostly Muslim , some Christian .
I 've loved living in the Middle East .
It has been good to us .
I met my wife in the Gulf .
Some of the nicest people I 've ever met were in Bahrain , Oman and Saudi Arabia .
" Would I go back to Saudi Arabia now ?
No .
I would n't put my family , my parents , through that , even if I wanted to .
Also I would n't want to go back and be seeming to thumb my nose at al - Qaida and say ' Na - na - na - na - na , you did n't get me . '
I 'm sure they were n't deliberately targeting me because of the job I do .
If they were , it 's an own goal , because they knocked out almost the only western broadcaster who bothers to explain what al - Qaida 's complaints are , what their motivation is , so taking me off the air for nearly a year would be a pretty stupid thing to do . "
Gardner has just gone back to his old job at the BBC - effectively , the Corporation 's " war on terror " correspondent .
He remains a tough critic of the Iraq war , dismissing the popular US belief that there was a link between Saddam Hussein and al - Qaida .
But would what had happened to him influence his wider reporting ?
By way of an answer , Gardner says he had found inspiration in Daniel Pearl , the Wall Street Journal reporter executed by Islamic radicals in 2002 .
Before his death , he had used his knowledge of these terror groups to explain , not condemn .
Gardner says that having survived a similar execution attempt he wanted to show that , by targeting journalists who sought to explain the reasons behind their actions , the militants were only hurting their cause .
Not that this means forgiving the individuals who shot him and Cumbers .
" I will try very hard to be as objective as I was before .
Do I forgive the people who did this to me ?
No , of course not .
They have n't apologised , they showed no mercy .
I 've had no little note saying , ' Gosh , we feel sorry about what we did . ' "
The Saudis claim that two of the five men who shot Gardner and Cumbers have been killed in subsequent shootouts , but have not made clear how they reached this conclusion .
Nor have they allowed British investigators to talk to the unarmed government minder , whose actions during the attack remain a mystery to Gardner .
" It 's particularly tough for Simon 's widow , because , of course , she 'd like to know that the people who killed her husband have been brought to justice or that there 's some kind of accountability . "
Gardner gets tired easily these days , but seems astonishingly busy .
Besides going back to work , writing a book and spending time with his family , he is doing all he can to start walking again .
He is undergoing physiotherapy at Stanmore hospital .
" By the time this piece comes out I will be starting to walk with calipers , but only for an hour or two a day , because it 's pretty exhausting , and it's not terribly efficient either , which is why a lot of spinally injured patients tend to just stick with a wheelchair , " he says .
" There is still hope , but the prognosis from Stanmore is that I will be a long - term wheelchair user .
The best end point I think I can hope for is that I will only need splints from the knees downwards .
I 've been told I will never get my feet back ; my feet are gone , basically .
They 're still there , but I can't feel anything .
Except for pain .
I have continual nerve pain in my legs .
It keeps me awake at night .
I never thought that nearly a year on from the injuries I 'd still be in so much pain . "
Gardner 's pain specialists have told him they cannot increase medication without giving him side effects such as drowsiness and headaches , which he refuses to countenance .
What he had not realised before about spinal injury , he says , is that feeling sorry for someone in a wheelchair because they can't walk is not the half of it .
" What you do n't see is the internal stuff .
When you 're spinally injured you also usually lose control of your bladder and bowels .
In my case mine were so shot up that I had to have things like catheters and bags anyhow , so it 's irrelevant for me , but for other people , that is one of the hardest things .
They 're having to use suppositories to empty their bowels , they 're having to put these awful catheters up their genitals - it 's really tough .
Which is why I think a lot of spinally injured people have this sort of pained expression on their face .
" Several things have kept me smiling : being back with my family , writing a book and improving with physio .
I think there will come a time when my locomotive improvement will hit the buffers , and I think that will be quite a depressing time .
At which point I 'll start investigating disabled sports such as disabled skiing and scuba diving .
Life 's got to go on .
" I want my life back .
I accept it 's never going to be the same as the life I had before injury but I 'm determined to make the most of it .
And one day I 'll go off and do something completely different . "
To quote Chris Anderson responding to Milton Friedman : “ A free lunch does n’t necessarily mean the food is being given away or that you ’ll pay for it later — it could just mean someone else is picking up the tab . ”
Indeed , Craig in New York offers this example of the negative externalities that can come along with free stuff .
On one hand : free soda .
On the other : notes like these .

Community Art
Put up a community art space and get the public to fill up the blank canvas with drawings and paintings .
Encourage interaction and dialogue about why nature matters !
Tip :
Use neon and glow - in - the - dark paints to let the artwork shine in the night !
Looks like a clown car .
How many can you count ?
WASHINGTON - The US Commission on Civil Rights , the nation 's 50 - year - old watchdog for racism and discrimination , has become a critic of school desegregation efforts and affirmative action ever since the Bush administration used a controversial maneuver to put the agency under conservative control .
Democrats say the move to create a conservative majority on the eight - member panel violated the spirit of a law requiring that no more than half the commission be of one party .
Critics say Bush in effect installed a fifth and sixth Republican on the panel in December 2004 , after two commissioners , both Republicans when appointed , reregistered as independents .
" I do n't believe that [ the law ] was meant to be evaded by conveniently switching your voter registration , " said Commissioner Michael Yaki , one of the two remaining Democrats .
The administration insists that Bush 's appointments were consistent with the law because the two commissioners who reregistered as independents no longer counted as Republicans .
The day before Bush made the appointments , the Department of Justice approved the move in a memo to White House counsel Alberto Gonzales 's office .
Other presidents have been able to create a majority of like - minded commissioners , but no president has done it this way .
The unusual circumstances surrounding the appointments attracted little attention at the time .
But they have had a sweeping effect , shifting the commission 's emphasis from investigating claims of civil rights violations to questioning programs designed to offset the historic effects of discrimination .
Before the changes , the agency had planned to evaluate a White House budget request for civil rights enforcement , the adequacy of college financial aid for minorities , and whether the US Census Bureau undercounts minorities , keeping nonwhite areas from their fair share of political apportionment and spending .
After the appointments , the commission canceled the projects .
Instead , the commission has put out a series of reports concluding that there is little educational benefit to integrating elementary and secondary schools , calling for closer scrutiny of programs that help minorities gain admission to top law schools , and urging the government to look for ways to replace policies that help minority - owned businesses win contracts with race - neutral alternatives .
The conservative bloc has also pushed through retroactive term limits for several of its state advisory committees .
As a result , some longtime traditional civil rights activists have had to leave the advisory panels , and the commission replaced several of them with conservative activists .
The commission has also stopped issuing subpoenas and going on the road to hold lengthy fact - finding hearings , as it previously did about once a year .
The commission had three planned hearings in the works when the conservative bloc took over and canceled them .
Instead , the panel has held only shorter briefings , all but one of which was in Washington , from invited specialists .
Commissioner Abigail Thernstrom , who dropped her GOP registration six weeks before Bush 's appointments , said the selection of conservatives to the state civil rights advisory committees provided " intellectual diversity . "
She also said the commission 's recent briefings and reports have been rigorous .
" They are completely balanced in a way they have n't been for years , " said Thernstrom , a former member of the Massachusetts Board of Education who until recently lived in Lexington .
A core mission of the Civil Rights Commission is to use its bipartisan fact - finding power in racial disputes to " gather facts instead of charges [ and to ] sift out the truth from the fancies , " as Senate majority leader Lyndon Johnson said in August 1957 .
In its early days , the commission 's work of collecting evidence of voter discrimination and police brutality laid the groundwork for major civil rights laws .
But the panel has stayed on the sidelines in recent controversies with civil rights overtones .
For example , the panel did not investigate allegations that black neighborhoods in Ohio received too few voting machines in the 2004 election or the murky circumstances surrounding a racially charged assault case in Jena , La. Kenneth Marcus , the commission 's staff director , said the panel has not issued subpoenas because they are time - consuming and " disrupted " its relations with other government agencies .
Marcus also said that members of the panel considered investigating the 2004 Ohio election dispute , but decided it would not be " the best use of their resources . "
The commission staff , he added , was recently briefed by the Justice Department about the Jena case and is monitoring the situation .
Democrats say Bush 's appointments threw the commission out of balance , violating the bipartisan intent of the law that forbids the panel from having more than four members of one party .
Five commissioners must agree before the agency approves a report or recommendation .
But Marcus , a Bush appointee , said " it 's not true " that the panel has become a party instrument .
" The commission is guided by four Republicans , two independents , and two Democrats , which is consistent with the statute governing the agency , " Marcus said .
" Certainly , we have a majority of conservatives right now , and that majority is taking the commission in a direction that is different than what we 've seen in the past . "
The commission - half appointed by the president and half by congressional leaders - has been under a 6 - to - 2 control by both liberals and conservatives before .
Especially since the 1980s , presidents and lawmakers have tried to tilt the panel by appointing independents who shared their party 's views on civil rights .
But until Bush 's 2004 appointments , no president used reregistrations by sitting commissioners to satisfy the law that forbids presidents from appointing a fifth commissioner of the same party .
Bush 's move , represented an unprecedented " escalation " in hardball politics , said Peter Shane , Ohio State University law professor .

10 Web Trends That Should Die in 2006
Here ’s a new years resolution for the web at large : stop doing silly things to users .
Following are top trends that I just hope will not see 2007 .
1 . “ Our article is too long , let ’s split it up into many pages . ”
You know , I like the Wired site , but they really should n’t split up articles into two different pages .
First of all , the “ continue ” button is n’t user - friendly .
While you might say “ it speeds up loading of the page ” , the truth is , when you ’re finished reading through half the article , the other half could have been quietly finished loading in the background .
In other words , by splicing up the page in halves , Wired actually increased loading time .
But maybe they ’re not doing it for the user , but to get better stats and show off more ads ?
What might be even more annoying about split articles is the fact that you ca n’t link to them in any meaningful way .
If I pull a quote from article page 2 , where should I link to as a blogger ?
To both articles ?
To the article beginning , which would make more sense to the reader who does n’t know the article ... but which does n’t contain the quote ?
I guess that ’s why many bloggers link straight to the print version of some of these articles ( they are less cluttered , too ) .
Last not least , an article that ’s spread out on different pages does n’t bode well with visitors coming from search engines .
Not only will the Google not show the article if the user searched for 1 word appearing only in the first half , and 1 word which appeared only in the second half ; readers may also directly stumble upon page 2 , and then do n’t understand the context well and leave .
2 . “ We have art content , so let ’s create an artistic navigation . ”
You know , sometimes the navigation is the content , for example when you ’re playing an ( online or offline ) adventure game .
Then , a player wants to have a hard time defeating barriers .
An art website , however , is not an adventure game , and artful navigation ( yeah , we get the point , the website is part of the artwork ) can really hurt the experience .
Even when you have drastic , challenging , and unusual content to show off ... there ’s nothing that says you ca n’t simply link to a well - made web video or similar content .
Not long ago , I came across a specific Japanese artist website .
There was so much neon blinking and movement , at first I did n’t even understand that it was completely broken and not showing as intended .
Then I switched to Internet Explorer , and the blinking and movement started to make a little sense ... but still gave me a hard time trying to locate the contact info .
3 . “ Let ’s ignore the rest of the world . ”
There are so many web applications that only work in the US , at times the web can be a boring place if you sit in Germany ( or anywhere else outside the US ) .
If I could get a dime for every web 2.0 release that was n’t localized in 2005 , I ... well , you know the story .
If small - time developers do n’t have the resources to localize , that ’s understandable – but the big ones like Google , Amazon , Yahoo , Apple ?
And often , it ’s not even an issue of resources ; sometimes , there ’s intentional copyright protection to prevent non-US users ( e.g. the iTunes music store , DVD region codes of course , and many more ) , or country - specific censorship ( e.g. the Google results , which , by the way , are very much spammed for German search queries ) .
Even when the sites are localized , translations are often shabby .
Just for fun I read through the German Gmail page yesterday , and one of the sentences was complete grammar garbage .
Would this happen to the English Gmail front - page as well ?
I doubt it .
4 . “ Let ’s spam everything ( blog comments , email accounts , referrer stats , discussion groups etc. ) ! ”
I do n’t think spammers will ever give up , not in 2006 or 2060 ... but hope dies last .
5 . “ Let ’s treat the mobile web as a separate entity . ”
It ’s kind of sad .
First , there was the world wide web and HTML .
One of the reasons Tim Berners - Lee created HTML the way he did ( next to making it be based on SGML , which pleased the SGML crowd , of course ) was to have a platform and media independent format to prevent having to have a certain computer to open a certain document .
That ’s why on the web ’s client - side we have the separation of content , functionality and layout into HTML , JS , and CSS respectively .
I can create a single media - neutral HTML , and offer the browser ( or user agent , as the W3C calls it ) different media - specific style sheets to choose from ... and let the browser ignore the style sheet if nothing fitting can be found ( which results in the naked content ) , which is enough in certain situations .
Now , that being said , you may wonder : why did people ever invent WML , an additional format to serve mobile browsers ?
And I guess the rest of the world asked the same question when WML came out , which is probably why it ’s dead today .
Plain HTML can serve mobile browsers fine already ( at least those mobile browsers that get the web ) !
And yet , many websites ( including Google ) treat the mobile web as a whole different beast .
It ’s great Gmail has a dozen inline frames to speed up loading of the page , but I would give all that back if I could use their service on my Nokia 6600 ( I can ’t ) .
There are ways to use less JavaScript than many online tools do , and to find compatible ways to make the page work even without JavaScript .
You do n’t want to read long texts on a mobile browser ?
Well , you do n’t have to , if you do n’t want to ( actually , you could , if the display is crisp ) .
You do n’t want to have Text to Speech technology read you a link blog ?
Of course not .
We are using the web in a variety of different contexts in our life , and we go to different websites for that .
We might read a news site in the train , we might watch a movie site on our desktop computer , or we might listen to a novel site while jogging .
This all can only be achieved by going back to Tim ’s original version , and creating platform neutral websites ( ideally , with platform neutral media types attached to it ) .
6 . “ Let ’s do a traditional homepage for our company . ”
A stock photo of a smiling phone support lady , surefire way to spot a “ traditional homepage . ”
A traditional homepage typically consists of :
A nested navigational structure with no way to find out which parts have changed ,
A lonely press release corner titled “ News ” ,
Practically no external links unless the site linked to is an official partner in some way ,
A hypothetical “ front - door navigation path ” approach to usability , which is so ’ 94 ,
No signatures or date stamps below articles ,
Advertisement bogus content , which no one cares to read about .
I hope in 2006 , major companies who are still on the web 1.0 train will upgrade to the world of blogs , podcasts , RSS , etc. , and replace their “ homepages ” with it .
The most important part of all of this , next to the technical buzzwords , is really about direct communication from people within the company to the people reading along on the web .
This has all been put down years ago in the Cluetrain Manifesto , which should be on the desk of everyone working at a web agency .
7 . “ Let ’s care about low bandwidth ! ”
You know , it ’s nice when sites like iFilm offer you three different choices to continue playing their videos .
But who wants to see those tiny blurred low - bandwidth videos anyway ?
What I want are even bigger video sizes – I ’ll promise to wait longer for better quality , and maybe those with low bandwidths should stop wanting to download videos all day .
As soon as iFilm and others give me something I can enjoy looking at – and maybe link straight to the video instead of embedding it , so I can download it in the background – I ’ll be back .
Maybe in 2006 ?
8 . “ Let ’s read out loud the URL on TV . ”
I do n’t know , I always think it ’s funny when someone on TV says , “ To find out more about this news magazine go to www.blabla.com.”
Duh , I could also enter the name of the magazine into a search engine instead , that works without you telling me .
9 . “ Let ’s tell everyone Firefox is the better browser . ”
I ’m a user of Firefox .
I like Firefox .
What I do n’t like is hubris .
And the Firefox promotion at times sure shows signs of it .
Firefox is more secure ?
I do n’t know , but I do know that those writing malicious website code have reason to target the one browser with the largest installed user base ( Internet Explorer ) .
If Firefox ever gets to be in that position , let ’s see if it ’s more secure .
Instead of telling people Firefox is better , I hope people more truthfully put the spotlight onto Firefox ’s many bugs ... some of which have been newly introduced in upgrades , and some of which are serious enough to become a daily annoyance .
( The last bug report I filed was before the 1.0 final release , and it has been ignored to this day , so I ’m not very eager to report more bugs . )
Some of the bugs introduced in Firefox 1.5 are so serious , I have to restart the browser to enter a single quote character into form fields ( great feature for a blogger ) .
The better browser ?
10 . “ Let ’s have a tiny font that looks better . ”
I guess that issue needs to be repeated until it ’s solved ( I think Nielsen talks about it once a year ) ... do n’t use tiny fonts , web developers , it ’s the # 1 reason hurting readability of your content !

Why The Web Sucks ( You Just Don't Know It )
by Sean Barrett , the man with no blog
2004-09-10
Once upon a time , the World Wide Web was going to be this awesome democratizing " everyone publishes , everyone reads " medium - - a giant international bulletin board .
Sure , most people just posted pictures of their cat .
The power law meant some Mahirs and dancing hamsters were more popular than others .
But there was something really neat about this idea .
Nowadays , most people seem to consider that web dead , save for blogs .
For a while I 've wanted to rant about the way I think the W3C has killed the web , but I 've been sitting on it for probably a year , because , to be honest , I know nothing about the W3C and the web standardization process ( other than the fact that they did n't seem open to public comment in 1998 — hence , six years later , browsers still lay tables out poorly ) .
However , I just discovered that browser developers started publically griping about the W3C themselves back in June 2004 .
David Baron of Mozilla wrote : " [ I ] believe that the W3C is no longer the primary organization to which we should look for future standardization on the Web . "
Ian Hickson of Opera commented before a W3C workshop ( he does n't seem to have summed it up quite as well afterwards )
I 'm very much at a loss as to what to expect from this workshop .
On the one hand I really can't see us convincing everyone else that the solution is to continue down the HTML path .
After all , it 's not in the interests of most of the other attendees .
Many of them are wanting to sell SVG , XForms , or XHTML products , and most of those who are n't are probably more concerned with developing a good theoretical solution than addressing the unfortunate pragmatic needs of today 's authors .
The W3C is a consortium of the sorts of attendees Hickson describes .
Brendan Eich ( also of Mozilla ) summarized the W3C cleverly with the title of this blog post :
The non -world non -wide non-web .
The sad fact is that the w3c is not concerned with the world wide web , AKA the Internet .
Rather , the focus for a while now seems to be on vertical tool / plugin and service / cellphone markets , where interoperation is not a requirement , content authors are few and paid by the vertical service provider , and new standards provide livelihoods and junkets for a relative handful of academics , standards body employees , and big company implementors .
That should be enough to give you a sense of what the W3C is up to .
Fortunately , these guys are not all talk and no action .
They have turned around and given us the WHAT Working Group , " a loose unofficial collaboration of Web browser manufacturers and interested parties who wish to develop new technologies designed to allow authors to write and deploy Applications over the World Wide Web . "
That seems a pretty clear mandate , right ?
Applications over the WWW , in clear contrast to the W3 C 's vertical intranet model .
Hickson elaborates in his blog ( if you have to skip , read the last paragraph at least , and hover ) :
Then again , I work for a browser vendor , and have been in the browser industry ( both voluntarily and as a job ) for years now .
So it 's not surprise that I think the browser is important as an application platform .
( Obviously , though , as Robert Scoble is eager to tell us , Web apps are n't the answer to everything .
I would n't recommend to anyone that they try to write a graphics manipulation package in HTML . )
The problem with the browser today is that applications based in the browser are constrained to nightmarish UI idioms and a severe lack of polish stemming from the fact that the platform was not really developed as a platform , and that no real progress has been made on this path for several years .
John Gruber points out that users do n't really seem to care about the poor UI , though .
The other advantages — especially the true zero - install cost of Web - based applications — far outweigh the costs .
But that 's why we started WHATWG : we want to make it easier to make nicer the kinds of applications that it makes sense to deploy over the Web .
Mail and news clients .
Cinema ticket sales .
Book stores .
Auction sites .
Multiplayer stategy games .
( Links and markup from original . )
Hickson 's really throwing down the gauntlet here .
Clearly there are two sorts of uses a browser can be put to
Vertical intranet " web " applications World - Wide Web applications -- typically ecommerce or social apps
In a later blog entry he hedges , seemingly believing that they might as well tweak work they do improving # 2 so it helps # 1 as well :
Something I had n't realised until recently is quite how many Web applications are hidden away inside intranet sites .
I always knew that there were some there , but the sheer numbers of such applications is quite surprising .
A few people have sent me confidential screenshots of their intranet applications ( with the sensitive parts censored , of course ) , which has really helped get me an idea of the kinds of features that would be most helpful to people writing such sites .
He does n't really explain this desire , but I do n't think it 's really anything sinister or inconsistent .
Now , all of these posts are about web applications , so technically the fact that they only mention web applications is n't a fault , but there are enough comments about the Web in general and about browsers in general that I pretty much feel justified in asking : what about # 3 ?
You know , the part where people post documents and other people read them , as opposed to web applications of flavors 1 or 2 ?
As C J Silverio observed a long time ago ( in a rant coincidentally titled the same as this one ) , " The net is precious to me because it gives ordinary human beings a way to communicate with other ordinary human beings .
Corporations have too many ways to cram their ads down my throat .
Human beings have the net . "
I get the feeling that browser authors feel it's ok to focus on things like web applications because case # 3 is well in hand , what with CSS to give nice pretty presentation and all .
There 's nothing they can do about the all - important content -- that 's up to the individual authors .
And yes , they can't change the content , ca n't make it suck less .
But there 's a lot they can do about my interaction with that content !
This is why the web sucks , but you just do n't know it .
It sucks because your experience interacting with the web could be vastly better , but browser authors are instead caught up in enhancing the abilities of content creators to enhance your experience , instead of directly enhancing your experience .
Yet very little of the stuff the web browser creators are adding comes into play in most of my interaction with the world wide web ( as opposed to the non- world non - wide non-web ) , especially in case # 3-- plain old documents from average users .
Average users having nothing to do with this stuff ; as ceej 's rant above describes , ability to generate good content has little bearing on ability to generate good presentation .
In fact , individuals writing material for the web these days are probably writing in blogs , posting comments to bulletin boards ( using bbcode instead of HTML ) , and contributing to wikis ( with their own custom markup language ) .
In none of these cases will those users directly use features of , say , CSS , much less Web Forms .
( The indirect use of CSS in templates as presentation separate from content is pretty much irrelevant in all three of those cases , where HTML is constructed dynamically from a content database anyway .
The indirect use of forms for wikis and bulletin boards is obvious , but also not obviously in need of much more than a text area and a submit button . )
Here 's a list of major browser standards introduced roughly after Netscape 3 ( when I started noticing browser devolution ) :
PNG
HTML 4.01
CSS1
DOM / DHTML
XHTML
CSS2
SVG
On the other hand , we can look at major browser innovations independent of the above ( this is based on my experience with Firefox ; I have n't tried Opera in four or five years ) :
tabbed browsing

Now what I want you to think about is the amount of work browser authors have put into implementing the standards above ( which , I claim , primarily improve the ability of content authors to control the appearance and interactivity -- though PNG is a special case involving GIF patents ) , versus the amount of work browser authors put into improving the user - controlled experience of interacting with web pages ( in the form of those last two innovations , the first of which is a small improvement on the Windows MDI model , and the latter of which has been in Emacs forever ) .
Now , you might protest " but they do lots of other work for the user experience besides just adding major features " , and this is somewhat true , but it 's pretty much just about treading water compared to something like NS 3 ( that is , the user experience treads water even if making that user experience the same requires a lot of work due to the new standards ) .
And they 're going to do that work no matter what ; it 's not optional .
However much work they 've put in on such things , I 'm arguing we 've traded off work on major new features for user - controlled experience in favor of new standards for author - control , even though the reality is that most of the websites I ( at least ) visit do not use those new standards , or if they do , use them without enhancing my experience ( e.g. XHTML ) , or without significantly enhancing my experience ( as in most uses of DHTML ; see Appendix A ) .
To give you a hand thinking about this , let 's point out how big the specifications for those standards are .
Since pages and lines can be arbitrarily sized , I 'm just going to use bytecounts of uncompressed HTML - formatted specs to give us a ballpark understanding .
( Some of these are one long file , some are multiple files , which may skew the results somewhat .
Do n't look at me , this is how the W3C distributes them . )
210 KB HTML 2.0 ( RFC 1866 is only 143KB , though ) 128 KB HTML 3.2 187 KB CSS1 1,547 KB HTML 4.01 2,131 KB XHTML 1.0 ( 72KB ) + XML ( 220 KB ) + HTML 4.01 ( 1,839 KB )
and not even counting various other specifications like XML namespaces 1,106 KB CSS2 638 KB DOM Level One ( 2nd ed ) 827 KB DOM Level Two Core + Level Two HTML 313 KB PNG ( 2nd ed ) 3,886 KB SVG 1.1
Let me highlight a few elements of this .
XML , a specification for generic self - delimiting ASCII data files , is nearly twice the size of HTML 3.2 , a fairly full - fledged markup language with tables and fonts and everything .
SVG 1.1 is 10 times the size of PNG ( of course it 's quite different ; perhaps it would be more relevant to compare the size of the SVG specification to the size of the Flash Player DLL ) .
HTML 4.01 is over 10 times as big as HTML 3.2 ; CSS2 is almost as big .
What is all of this good for ?
A lot of what seems to have turned web authors ' cranks about CSS has simply been features entirely unavailable in plain HTML , like positioning .
Positioning is all about abandoning the old model that authors can't have total control over the layout .
It 's all about abandoning the idea that different people access a website in different contexts .
What this means , of course , is a lot of lousy browsing experience going to web sites where your fonts are n't the size they expect or your web browser is narrower than they expected .
( The web browsers naturally honor requests for frames without scrollbars even when they 're needed , since the content creator is always right ! )
I even get to use my handy " zap style sheet " bookmarklet when I reach websites that are theoretically well - designed but in practice unreadable for me simply due to insufficient text contrast .
Yes , Virginia .
There really are people out there with content worth reading but whose presentation sucks , at least for my poor eyes and tiny screen pixels .
( Huh , what ?
User stylesheets ?
I have to learn CSS to view the web ? )
So not only do these new standards get used rarely , but when they do , a lot of the time they seem to just make things worse on category # 3 sites — which makes the effort spent implementing them seem a tad frivolous .
( Especially if what you believe is that it's the content that really matters . )
Now , in part , CSS was developed in the hopes that web authors would be able to stop having to do browser - specific workarounds to display what they want , but apparently IE 's incomplete CSS support hosed this plan .
That this surprises anyone surprises me .
If you keep evolving the standards , nobody is going to be up to spec !
As a result , web designers are basically just as screwed as they were , and people with perfectly functional old web browsers are forced to upgrade to slightly less - functional browsers with better standards support ( I only switched from Netscape Navigator 4.08 within the last year ) .
Is anybody happy ?
I guess the people being paid to implement the new standards .
Some time , a long time ago , the Mozilla developers got it in their head that they were developing an application platform , and they 've never lost that drive , and it seems use # 3 has long since fallen by the wayside .
As a result , real security concerns arise , and we end up with web applications developers from category # 1 ( I guess ) arguing against disallowing ' location=no ' when you have to wonder why we even need to give people in category # 3 -- and even people in category # 2 who are the imitatees of phishing scams -- the ability to download custom XUL .
( In fact , a deeper concern this bug advances is that even without XUL , somebody can spoof a fake window in the middle of the client area just using DHTML .
Somehow I seem to be the only one in the world who sees this as evidence that providing DHTML over the insecure world of the Internet is itself going too far .
Maybe we do n't have to be quite so Turing - complete ?
Does PayPal really prefer to have the option to spiffify their UI at the cost of making life easier for phishers ? )
So , look , obviously if what you care about is # 1 , or even # 2 , I 'm not going to convince you .
You can just wander off now , content in the fact that I do n't understand the business proposition facing browser authors , or whatever .
And sure , I do n't .
You can argue that maybe we need a whole different class of web browsers for # 3 - style web page browsing , or just to make fuck - ups like me happy .
But those # 2 - driven browsers create a market in which all browsers must be standards compliant .
I 'm all for standards compliance in theory , but right now that means all browsers need to implement those 7 + MB of features the W3C spewed out while people still considered the W3C relevant , rather than just , say , the 128KB HTML 3.2 specification .
( Ok , 7 MB includes SVG ; even without that , we 're still talking 20 x the size of HTML 3.2 , and probably more than 20 x the complexity , since most of this stuff is n't modular the way , say , the Flash plugin is . )
This is complicated enough it 's nearly impossible to start a new browser from scratch , and even " new browser " efforts like Firefox that build from an open source base like Mozilla turn out to be hemmed in by the original architecture .
It 's an interesting experience to read through Bugzilla and discover how hard some things are that obviously are only hard because of the architecture , not because of some inherent problem .
For example , some users would like the ability for , say , the file " foo.c " to open in the browser inline , rather than launching out to the OS - configured external application ( in my case , a programming IDE ) : bug # 57342 .
It turns out that Mozilla 's file download " stream converter " model has some limitation ( last discussed in March 2002 ) that makes it difficult for the browser to change its mind in the middle of the download from downloading as a file to downloading to the browser .
( The problem being that once the stream is seen to be not a type the browser handles internally , it is handed off to a system that pops up a ' do you want to save or open with ' , and adding the option ' open with browser ' there is hard .
Yet , clearly , given only that specification and no existing infrastructure , the problem is not at all hard .
Parse the stream ; if it 's not " text / html " or another type handled internally , pause , pop up the window , discover what you should do with it , and go .
Mozilla instead has already bailed on internalizing the stream by the time the window pops up , and it 's too late to go back . )
Sometimes it's hard to see in Bugzilla what exactly the holdup is .
If I want to click an .mp3 link and have the URL be handed to my streaming mp3 player , rather than have it downloaded entirely and then handed over , I am stuck .
( Unless , apparently , I use Opera or IE ) .
For Firefox , this is bug 225882 : " Ability to pass URLs to helper apps ( for streaming ) instead of downloading and then passing the entire file . "
Fixing this bug depends on some " backend work " , marked as a dependency on bug 137339 : " want way to hand URL to helper apps without downloading whole document first " , which I guess is the Mozilla version of this bug -- although it 's marked OS Linux , and it last received a comment in January 2003 .
Meanwhile , that bug is marked as depending on bug 90501 : " Allow sending URL instead of file to helper app based on content type . "
( Sound familiar ? )
Last real comment in January 2003 ( save for a dupe report and a " I really want this " comment ) .
The three bugs only have 10 , 6 , and 2 votes , so they do n't get much love .
And I believe these sorts of things would have gotten fixed faster if standards - compliance was n't so complicated .
I 'd think about fixing these things myself , but Mozilla falls in the realm of code so over - engineered it takes too long to get up to speed to change the tiniest thing .
( Possibly this is necessary over - engineering due to the complexity of the problem and the desire for widely distributed programming .
But it 's an impassable barrier for me to do any casual fixing , and in my estimation it must be a barrier to getting outside contributors . )
Worse yet , Opera and Mozilla and Apple are n't saying , " Goddamn this stuff is just already too complicated .
Let 's just freeze what we 've got and really consider it a standard , so we can just fix all the damn bugs and work on interactivity . "
Instead , it seems they 've bought whole hog into W3 C's " what 's good for the web is constant generation of new standards " , and they 're happily generating more and more !
Yay !
Go content authors , now you can make javascript draw images !
Spoofers of the world unite !
( If nothing else it 's great for Opera , since it raises the barrier to entry for potential competitors .
Since the other browsers are n't developed for profit , though , and they 're just as gung ho , that 's probably not Opera 's reasoning either . )
Meanwhile , when someone mentions something to me and I remember having seen something relevant on the web a little while ago , I get to grovel through thousands of poorly - organized bookmarks ( missed innovation opportunity ) hoping I thought to bookmark it , because if I did n't bookmark it , I get to grovel through my IE - clone " history pane " with less functionality than the Netscape 4 history window ( browser devolution due to Firefox 's anti-featureism ) , but it's not there because I only keep 9 days of history because it 's dog slow if I keep 90 days much less 730 ( 18 - month - old bug ) , and then I have to go to Google and hope I can remember something distinctive enough to locate the page again although its Page Rank is low — even though hard drives these days are enormous and why are n't I just full - text searching the text of all the web pages I 've visited in the last 90 days ( missed innovation opportunity ) ?
1 2 I do n't know , but it seems to be because the blue sky got clouded over by Hurricane WebApp .
1 I actually had to do this while writing this article — except searching on Bugzilla not Google - - because I never end up thinking up the right keywords for finding bugs I 've seen before .
If you 're wondering why the link about XUL spoofing did n't actually have any web app devs arguing against ' location=no ' , it 's because I think I saw that somewhere , but I could n't find the actual bug where I 'd seen it .
2 This is n't a unique scenario .
I 'm constantly bumping into these sorts of bugs ( misfeatures ) and browser devolutions whenever I use Firefox .
Some of these show in Bugzilla as new Firefox bugs ; some show as ancient , unloved bugs in Mozilla .
Many of the obvious possible innovations show up as enhancement requests ; who knows how many non-obvious ones we 're ignoring ?
And then there are the devolutions .
Some of these are hard to judge , since different people approach the browser with different workflow , and I 'm a power user , but I think little issues like this behavior I hate indicate a lack of " big picture " thought about the web - browsing experience in favor of ( in this case ) pursuit of standards and conventional rules - of - thumb .
Appendix A : Data From My Browser History
Looking at the last 25 pages in my browser history ( 25 because that 's when I got bored -- this actually takes a lot of work ) , I find :
40 % are category 3 ; 16 % are web applications
68 % use stylesheets ; 16 % use inline CSS ; 16 % use no CSS
64 % specify no DTD ; 16 % are HTML 4 , 4 % are HTML 3.2 ; 16 % are XHTML 1.0
8 % use DHTML ; 40 % use JavaScript in other significant ways ; ~ 16 % more use JS in trivial ways
Actually , on further reflection , I guess LiveJournal recently added a new " inline comment " feature that 's DHTML , but I was n't looking at a page with comments .
Raw Data
The following table details most of the sites in my browser history from the last few days .
For each site , I indicate the type of HTML : HTML 4.01 , XHTML 1.0 , etc .
( Some pages do n't specify a DTD , especially hand - authored pages . )
Also the use of CSS : CSS , inline CSS ( no separate style sheet ) , CSS ( no style use ) ; the use of SVG : SVG ( ok , guess what , there 's none ) ; the use of DHTML / DOM and JavaScript : DHTML , JS .
( I omit JS if it 's only used for banner ads , e.g. Google AdSense , and trivial things like opening comment windows . )
I probably should have made note of pages that used tables for layout , as almost all of them did ( if they did any layout at all ) .
All sites with XHTML sent it as text / plain .
I also indicate whether it is category 2 ( a web - application sort of site ) or category 3 ( plain documents authored by Joe EndUser ) , or # for professionally - created plain documents .
I only include one page from each site .

Following are excerpts from a Hamas children 's show , " The Pioneers of Tomorrow " , which aired on Al - Aqsa TV on February 22 , 2008 :
Child host Saraa Barhoum : Amani , you 've seen the kind of attack that the West launched against the Prophet Muhammad .
What do you have to say on behalf of the Prophet Muhammad ?
Amani , by phone :
In the name of Allah , the Merciful , the Compassionate , I say to those cowardly infidels ...
Assud the Bunny : Those criminals ...
Amani : Yes , those criminals ...
You mock our Prophet Muhammad , but look , my beloved Prophet Muhammad , how Allah responded to them : " Allah shall pay them back for their mockery , and He leaves them alone in their excess , blindly wandering on . "
My beloved Messenger of Allah , they mocked you with their drawings , because they do not know the mercy in your heart .
My beloved Muhammad , if they had known the mercy in your heart , they would not have done this to you .
Allah knows that we love you , and that we will redeem you with our souls , our blood , and our hearts .
[...]
Assud :
Do you boycott Israeli and Danish products ?
Amani : Yes , Assud .
I do .
Assud :
You 've stopped eating them altogether ?
Amani : I have .
Assud :
That 's great .
Keep it up .
Saraa :
All of us will definitely boycott Danish products , and even before that , we will boycott Israeli products , Amani .
Amani :
With your permission , I 'd like to continue .
Assud and Saraa : Go ahead .
Amani : Finally , I 'd like to apologize to the Messenger of Allah .
May Allah curse these infidels , who have gone astray .
We the soldiers of the pioneers of tomorrow , apologize to you , beloved Messenger of Allah .
Denmark has spoken heresy , but you are a source of pride and mercy for Islam and the Muslims .
Assud : The [ American ] cowboys have spoken heresy as well .
[...]
Amani : Our brothers , the Americans , have affronted the Prophet Muhammad ...
Assud :
They are not our brothers , they are criminals .
Amani : What ?
Assud :
They are infidels , not our brothers .
Amani :
They are enemies of Allah , and they have affronted the Prophet Muhammad .
[...]
Saraa : How did these Danes have the audacity to affront the Messenger of Allah ?
Do you have an answer to that , Assud ?
Assud :
No , I do n't .
Maybe because the Arabs and Muslims keep silent , [ the Danes ] humiliated them and did these things to them .
Saraa :
That 's one reason , but there is an even more important reason , Assud .
Assud : I have no idea .
Saraa :
It 's because the West has seen that we 've moved away from the religion of Allah , and from the Sunna of our Prophet Muhammad .
They have also seen that we have forsaken the religion of Allah , and therefore , they could affront the Prophet , because ...
We have done nothing to redeem the Prophet Muhammad .
But I say to them :
You have n't seen anything yet .
Allah willing , the soldiers of the Pioneers of Tomorrow will redeem the Prophet Muhammad with all that they possess , and even with their blood , Assud .
They will not allow them to do this again .
Assud :
If they do it again , Saraa , we will kill them , right ?
Saraa : Allah willing .
Assud : I will bite them and eat them up .
Saraa : Yes .
[...]
Assud , we are not terrorists .
All we want is to get our beloved homeland , Palestine , back .
We want all of Palestine to be ours .
We are not terrorists ...
Assud : Because it was ours to begin with , right ?
Saraa : Right .
They say we are terrorists merely because we want this , but of course , we 're not terrorists ...,/ p>
Assud :
They are the terrorists .
Saraa : Yes , Assud .
Allah willing , we will regain the cities under Zionist occupation , such as Jaffe , Haifa , Acre , Ashdod , the village of Hoj , and all the Palestinian cities .
Assud : Saraa , do you know what I 'm hoping for ?
I want us to take Jaffe , Acre , Haifa , and all of Palestine , Allah willing , and then we 'll go to Iraq .
All the borders will be opened .
Between Egypt and us , there will be no barriers , and the same goes for Jordan and Saudi Arabia .
We 'll come and go by car .
I hope this comes true .
Do you think this will come true ?
Saraa : Allah willing , this will come true soon .
Assud : Allah willing , when I am martyred , a tiger will take my place ...
Allah willing , I will be the one to fix things , and there wo n't be any tiger .
The " Pioneers of Tomorrow " and I will make this dream come true .
[...]
Who will host this show if you are martyred ?
Will 100,000 Saraas take your place ?
Saraa : Allah willing , Assud .
Assud :
We 'll take them from among the Pioneers of Tomorrow , Allah willing .
Saraa : Allah willing , there are thousands of soldiers of the Pioneers of Tomorrow .
Assud : Martyrdom for the sake of Allah is what we hope for , right ?
Saraa : Right , Assud .
[...]
Saraa :
What do you have to say to the cartoonist who started all this , and affronted the Prophet by drawing him ?
Assud :
He 's a criminal ...
Saraa : Yes , a criminal .
Tasnim , by phone : I say to him , and to all of them , that no matter how much they try to hide him , we will manage to kill him , to assassinate him .
Assud : Allah willing .
Saraa : I pray that Allah makes the earth swallow him up , so that he serves as a lesson to others like him , Tasnim .
[...]
Assud , it appears that our show is coming to an end .
What do you have to say to this criminal , the cartoonist who affronted the Prophet by drawing him ?
Assud : I say to him what you already said :
You criminal , you lowlife , you scum of the earth – right , Saraa ?
Allah willing , the day will come when you will regret what you did .
Prime minister 's questions sketch
By Guto Harri
BBC political correspondent
This can't have been his dream birthday .
Waking up as prime minister - yes .
Having the first pre-dawn coffee in the study of Number 10 - most certainly .
A birthday smile from Mr Brown
But half - an - hour at the despatch box being mocked and hounded by people he hates - I doubt it .
Celebrating 57 years on the planet is no excuse , however , to avoid the House of Commons , and just before noon - Gordon Brown squeezed past cabinet colleagues to take his place at the despatch box .
He did so like a condemned prisoner , clutching a shabby pile of papers , plastered with post - it notes in yellow , orange and green .
Flash of teeth
No leather sheath as a birthday present then .
No organised file like that carried confidently by his predecessor , whose dream birthday probably did involve holding his own in a hostile environment and showing off to the cameras .
Gordon Brown has been around long enough not to expect any generous gift from David Cameron .
And , for a second he looked unnerved when the Conservative leader wished him a happy birthday .
Off they went again - on that familiar pattern - ending with a bizarre exchange of insults .
Grave faces cracked into smiles along the front bench .
There was a flash of teeth from the prime minister , as his colleagues cheered .
Highlighting the anniversary - of course - was the first dig of the day by David Cameron - reminding all of us that there 's a decade and a half between the two leaders .
But there were two other attacks to come today .
Northern Rock
" Enough of that " , said Mr Cameron , before turning into an aggressive inquisitor , seemingly outraged that the government had taken a year to follow up Dutch warnings about dangerous criminals on our shores .
The pattern afterwards , is now well established .
Mr Cameron asked about the " catastrophic " failure to check DNA data
David Cameron poses questions which make Gordon Brown look incompetent and indecisive .
Gordon Brown avoids the question and poses his own to his opponent , as if the Conservative leader 's failure to answer a straight question is more embarrassing that his own .
The only relief on his birthday was not taking a blow over Northern Rock .
The Liberal Democrats did raise that issue , but Mr Brown did n't seem to mind that .
It was then that I witnessed the man - to - man stare across the despatch box .
The prime minister had carelessly suggested Mr Cameron was too embarrassed to raise questions about the Rock .
' Student politics '
Mr Cameron smiled , tapped his notes , and mouthed the menacing words - I 've got some questions here .
Within minutes , he was on his feet .
" He wants a Northern Rock question ... here 's one for him " , and off they went again - on that familiar pattern - ending with a bizarre exchange of insults .
David Cameron said the PM's record on freedom of information would make Fidel Castro proud .
Gordon Brown attacked his opponent for engaging in " student politics " .
There was laughter all round - but who were they laughing at or with ?
After all that , most of us would head off for a good lunch , drowning all memories of another miserable parliamentary session in our favourite wine .
Not this prime minister .
Gordon Brown headed off to deliver a speech on citizenship .
Later on he 'll greet so - called champions of climate change .
And tonight ?
A party ?
Dinner with friends ?
A night out with his wife in one of the world 's best cities .
His subdued spokesman suggests that would be frivolous , and predicted " a quiet evening with the family " .
Katie Vallis is three hours into a 12 - hour shift answering 999 calls at the London Ambulance Service 's emergency operations centre in Waterloo when her 27th call of the day is patched through to her headset .
" I think I 've dislocated my shoulder , " barks a 30 - year - old male caller .
" How ? "
" Dunno , really .
I was just on my sofa .
I think I must have been lying on it wrong .
I need an ambulance . "
Without even glancing at her keyboard , Katie , 20 , calmly starts to take the caller 's details and type them into the system .
As she enters the address , a detailed map of the caller 's area in south - west London flashes up on her screen .
She points to the nearest A&E department , less than a mile from the caller 's home .
" I do n't know why he does n't just walk himself down to A&E , " she says to me with her hand over the microphone , before explaining that , no matter what she thinks of a caller 's predicament , all calls are logged and assessed .
An " allocator " on the other side of the huge operations room will decide whether an ambulance should be diverted to the address and , if so , which one .
Another 999 call comes through - this time an " RTA " ( road traffic accident ) in Islington , north London , involving a motorcyclist , who is unconscious .
Katie receives this kind of call every few minutes .
Months earlier , I had also made a 999 call for an ambulance when my wife went into the advanced stages of labour at home .
Katie was the dispatcher - they dislike being called " operators " - who answered that day and , with the midwives delayed in traffic , she talked me through how to deliver my son over the course of the 11 - minute call .
Naturally , this formed a bond between us - Katie was still new to the job and it was her first - ever " BBA " ( born before arrival ) - and when we finally met face - to - face , I took up Katie 's offer to spend a shift listening in to the huge variety of calls the emergency operations centre deals with each day .
This is the world 's busiest ambulance control room , although you would n't know it from the building 's characterless facade .
Once through security , you can spot clues about its importance to the capital 's wellbeing .
Plaques and award certificates line the corridor , but it is the signed photographs praising the building 's occupants that catch the eye - Tony Blair , Queen ( the band rather than the monarch ) and footballer Rio Ferdinand , to name a few .
Many make direct reference to the LAS 's most testing day in living memory - July 7 2005 .
In the main control room - a second , smaller room for full - scale emergencies lies empty on the opposite side of the corridor - I am shown to Katie 's desk .
She sits with around 25 other dispatchers , with a similar number of allocators on a platform to the right .
Allocators are charged with managing the movements of the service 's 388 ambulances and 142 rapid - response vehicles .
This room handles medical emergency call - outs across the whole of Greater London , a 620 square - mile area with a population of more than seven million .
In 2006 / 7 , the LAS handled 1.2 m calls and attended 865,000 incidents .
( During a busy period , the control centre receives about 250 calls an hour . )
It estimates that every time a call to the service requires a response , it costs the taxpayer £ 165 .
I have arrived mid-afternoon on a cold , clear winter 's day .
Sitting beside Katie , I ask whether she can judge by the time of day , or even the weather , if she is going to be in for a busy shift .
" Rush hour is just getting going now , with the school run in full flow , " she says .
" This can be one of the busiest times .
When people are waking up can be busy , too , as they might have discovered that a relative has died in their sleep .
New Year 's
Eve is the busiest night of the year , plus the Christmas party season , when the volume of calls rises by about 15 % .
Ice and wet weather are always bad for accidents .
Also , if it is really hot , with people out drinking all day , we get a lot of calls .
You also get the elderly collapsing in the heat . "
The LAS estimates that nearly 5 % of all 999 calls it receives concern alcohol - related incidents , although the figure rises to 14 % between 12 am and 1 am on Saturday nights .
To date , the relaxation of licensing hours has n't caused a discernable decrease in the number of alcohol - related " disorder flashpoint " calls , which spike between 11 pm and 2 am on Friday and Saturday nights .
In total , alcohol - related 999 calls have risen by 12 % in the past two years .
Occasionally , the LAS experiences a perfect storm : the weekend that England was knocked out of the World Cup in 2006 also coincided with a heatwave , and the service handled 9,500 calls in two days .
In quick succession , three calls come in .
First , a care worker at a nursing home says an 87 - year - old woman resident has fallen to the ground and is fitting .
Next , a 37 - year - old man has fallen over and cut his eye after the bus he was on braked suddenly .
Then a young woman calls from her mobile to say she thinks a teenage boy has been stabbed outside a shop in north London .
Katie says these are all routine calls for her and she can often deal with them in a matter of seconds .
With the suspected stabbing , she notices other dispatchers in the control room around her also taking calls from witnesses at the scene .
She logs into her system a few minutes later to follow the progress of the incident and notices that the air ambulance has been stood down because paramedics are at the scene .
This call will remain etched into my memory for days afterwards , but Katie says she usually forgets them within a few hours , such is the pace and volume of calls she handles .
The ones that do stick in her mind involve sexual assaults or children who have died .
" We get stress breaks and we can also ask for counselling if we need it , " she says .
" So far , I have only experienced two people dying during the call .
We can also get suicide - related calls , but many are classic calls for help and we just try to distract them with a chat . "
Their frontline position means that the dispatchers deal with more than medical emergencies : they also report suspected cases of abuse of children and vulnerable adults .
In 2006 / 7 , 1,896 adults and 574 children were recommended for " further investigation " by the LAS .
Each call is given a priority code and this determines the response time .
A " red " call is the most medically pressing ; for example , a heart attack or serious head injury .
Medical teams must aim to be on the scene within eight minutes of the moment the dispatcher logs the details .
The target for " amber " calls ( " serious but not immediately life - threatening " , such as strokes and back injuries ) is 19 minutes and for " green " calls ( " neither serious nor life - threatening " , such as hospital - to - hospital transfers ) it is an hour .
From April , new targets mean that the clock will start ticking from the moment the call comes in , which will , in effect , shave two minutes off the current response limits .
( Katie 's tip when calling in an emergency is , if possible , to dial 999 from a landline as the location of the phone immediately flashes up on the dispatcher 's screen .
Calling from a mobile can add seconds , or even minutes , as the dispatcher must first establish the location of the caller . )
" Sometimes I wo n't get any all day , " says Katie .
" Sometimes , four to five a day will come in . "
The LAS estimates that only one in every 10 calls involves someone in a potentially life - threatening situation .
Initially , the control room computer will grade the call by assessing the data typed in by the dispatcher .
The four main factors are " chest pain " , " breathing " , " haemorrhaging " and " consciousness " .
If any of these are entered as a problem by the dispatcher then the call will automatically be graded as a " red " .
It is not a foolproof system .
A drunk who has passed out will be classified " red " if they are deemed to be unconscious .
" This annoys the ambulance crews , " says Katie , " but there 's nothing you can do about it . "
Katie adds that some " frequent fliers " - the nickname for persistent callers - have got wise to this system and now know that if they mention " chest pains " an ambulance will be dispatched automatically .
Many " frequent fliers " are well known to dispatchers and they will often realise who is calling before answering because their number will be recognised by the system and trigger an alert on screen .
This is also true for anyone with a history of violence , as the crew in attendance will require a police escort .
In February , a woman who had called 999 for an ambulance more than 1,000 times in the past three years received a 28 - day suspended prison sentence .
She was also prohibited from making " false and unnecessary calls " .
As Katie 's shift draws to a close , the calls continue : there 's another motorbike accident ; a 35 - year - old woman calling from a tube station says she got off the train after getting " irregular heartbeats " ; a young heroin addict says she thinks she 's pregnant and is worried because she 's started bleeding and has just " seen a rat while eating a melon in the kitchen " .
Most shifts conclude with a team drink at the local pub , but as she is facing a run of four night shifts Katie says she needs an early night .
Before I go , I ask her how long she expects to keep doing such a high - adrenaline , emotionally draining job .
" I love it , but my real aim is to go out on the road , " she says .
" First , though , I have to go to university and study paramedic science . "
Last summer , Katie was working at her local Woolworths when a friend persuaded her to download an application at the LAS website .
Like thousands of others who have been lucky enough to have her answer their 999 call , I can't thank her enough .
A well - meaning , but rushed , journalist named Ben Charny interviewed me this morning about Microsoft ’s interoperability press release .
He made a ridiculous number of mistakes .
That ’s the nature of the wire reporters on deadline .
Here are some corrections .
“ For want of a few key details from Microsoft Corp . ( MSFT ) , Joel Spolsky tried but failed more than 10 years ago to make a better version of Microsoft ’s remote office desktop - computer feature . ”
Not true .
Fog Creek Copilot was developed less than three years ago and has been under continous development since then .
It has been a profitable product and we ’re still developing new versions .
I believe that what we built is better than Microsoft ’s Remote Desktop in many ways ( it works through firewalls , supports Macintosh and Windows , and is easier to set up for ad - hoc tech support ) and it ’s worse in some ways ( it ’s slower , and uses JPG compression as an optimization which can make the screen blurry ) .
So it ’s debatable whether I “ failed . ”
There was no need for “ a few key details from Microsoft ” because we do n’t interoperate with Remote Desktop , we use the open source VNC protocol ( incidentally , the client code for Copilot is freely available under the GPL ) .
“ Now Project Co-Pilot has gotten new life . ”
OK , it ’s not “ Project Co- Pilot ” , it ’s Fog Creek Copilot , and , like I say , we ’ve been working on it continuously for almost three years and are about to release a major new version , so nothing about Microsoft ’s announcement granted it “ new life . ”
That part is just a fabrication .
“ On Thursday Spolsky finally located those elusive lines of code tucked inside 30,000 pages made public Thursday by Microsoft .
Before they were available only under trade - secrets licenses . ”
Huh ?
Lines of code ?
Ok , I understand , tech journalists may not understand the difference between “ lines of code ” and protocol specifications .
When the press release came out , I was curious to see if it included a spec for the Remote Desktop protocol .
We ’ve always known how the protocol works , and how it transmits GDI commands for performance reasons , which is neither rocket science nor a trade secret .
I do n’t know if the concept is patented , but the X Window server worked this way before Windows was even invented , so if there is a patent for this GDI business , it ai n’t Microsoft ’s , but that ’s neither here nor there .
Copilot does n’t use the remote desktop protocol , full stop , and we do n’t plan to .
I just happened to look for that in the spec ( in the 15 minutes between Microsoft ’s press release and the time the journalist called me ) because I was curious to see what kind of stuff was in there , and this was an area I had wondered about .
By sharing more technical information about its key products on Thursday , Microsoft has jump - started a wave of development destined to unleash software that will compete with many more of Microsoft ’s own products .
One of the first appears to be remote desktop software , which uses a secured Internet connection to remotely access files and features stored on office - desktop computers .
Currently , there ’s no third - party version of the software , save for Citrix Systems Inc. ( CTXS ) , which has a cross- licensing deal with Microsoft .
But Microsoft ’s existing product is a very basic one , making it rife for improvements .
Its relative simplicity is demonstrative of how there ’s been no competitive offerings that would have forced Microsoft to make a better widget .
This part is what he got mostly right , and it ’s what I said .
As far as I know , there are no competitive clients for Windows Remote Desktop ( formerly called Terminal Services ) except for Citrix ’s cross-licensed implementation , presumably because the protocol was never publicized .
As a result , if you want to use Windows Remote Desktop , you are stuck with the rudimentary clients Microsoft gives you .
There are LOTS of great competitive remote desktop solutions that include both the client and the server ; besides our own Copilot , there ’s Bomgar , LogMeIn , GotoMyPC , and the granddaddy PCAnywhere , and another dozen or so options .
But I ’m pretty sure none of them interoperate with Remote Desktop because the spec has not been available .
Everybody , including Copilot , has their own protocol , usually a variation of the RFB protocol [ PDF spec ] .
So I thought this was one example of an area where Microsoft actually stood to gain from publicizing their protocols .
It ’s bound to open up lots of opportunities in hundreds of areas ( remote desktop is just a tiny example ) where third - party developers will be able to develop better drop - in versions of various pieces of the Microsoft software stack , which helps the Microsoft ecosystem more than it detracts from their business .
Microsoft is n’t making a dime off of RDC because it ’s free and built into Windows … a few competive options with more features can only help the Windows business in the long run .

The private BitTorrent tracker Moviex has been setup and configured to leech from public BitTorrent users .
Through some clever modifications , their tracker allows non-members to seed to the private tracker , while downloading is forbidden .
Private BitTorrent trackers are supposed to be private and for registered members only .
A non-member that downloads a torrent from a private tracker will usually get a tracker connection failure in their BitTorrent client .
They will not be able to download or upload any data from that torrent , rendering the torrent useless to them .
This is the basis that most private trackers work upon , but not Moviex .
Lately , several people have noticed a sudden rise in torrent files being uploaded to public indexing sites like Newtorrents , Mininova , and The Pirate Bay .
These uploaded torrent files contain two announce URLs , one from The Pirate Bay and a moviex .
info URL that always has the same passkey present , presumably the passkey for an anonymous user .
http://www.moviex.info:2710/...3c73mdqxj31q/announce
http://vip.tracker.thepiratebay.org/announce
To see a pirate bay tracker URL present in a torrent file is nothing out of the ordinary .
So what ’s special about the moviex .
info URL being present in public torrents ?
Well , the message you get when trying to connect to the moviex .
info tracker if you are not a member might give you a hint .
“ Failure : access denied , leeching forbidden , you ’re only allowed to seed ”
Normally you would get something like : “ Failure : unregistered torrent pass . ”
However , moviex .
info allows non-members to seed files , while they are not allowed to download .
This is a huge bonus for MovieX and its members .
Currently , newtorrents .
info provides 1000 ’s of downloads per day to torrent users and reportedly 50 % of the available torrents on that site have the moviex .
info tracker URL present , the actual percentage may even be be higher .
It is not unusual for private trackers to upload files to public sites .
Most of the time this is done to advertise the tracker , so their community grows .
However , we do n’t see torrents like this very often , I ’m not sure if they do this on purpose , but they are definitely leeching bandwidth from people who only use the public tracker .
It ’s a pretty nice system if you want your private tracker to gain external seeds along with faster download speeds for your members ,
It ’s however also a very damaging method for any user who is not a member of MovieX .
info as they will continually upload pieces of the torrent to users who will give very little if anything at all back .
To see exactly what this tracker configuration does and how it works watch the video below .
The video shows two clear examples , one of a non seeded file and one of a seeded file using these rogue torrents , obviously for legal reasons we have renamed the torrents that I used for this demonstration ( HQ download ) .
There is a way to prevent the leeching .
If you download a torrent file from a public tracker check the tracker URL’s and remove the moviex .
info announce URL if it is present .
This will stop you seeding the file on that tracker and in turn not allow members of moviex .
info to leech data from you .
You could also try blocking their IP Address ( 206.53.62.206 ) in your IP filter if you are not a member of the MovieX community .
MovieX have taken the time to code this feature into their tracker and at the moment as far as we can tell they are the only private site exploiting this type of dirty hack to leech from external BitTorrent users .
What moviex .
info should do is configure their tracker not to allow external users without a passkey to connect to their tracker in any way , instead it would seem they have deliberately setup to leech as much data from the public BitTorrent community as possible and boost their own private community speeds .
MovieX deny this is the case and claim these torrents to be no more than simple advertising for the site in an attempt to attract new members ?
Update : MovieX is now blocked by PeerGuardian , a simple solution is to download and install the application .
Thanks Stuart !

Fox & Friends promotes global warming deniers ' conference David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Monday March 3 , 2008
|
Print This Email This Fox News believes the " other side " of the global warming debate has n't received enough attention and is determined to repair the omission .
" Despite it being bitterly cold outside in the northern plains , we hear a lot about global warming , " began Steve Doocy of Fox & Friends .
" Is there another side to this story ?
Many scientists would say yes , but most media outlets -- the mainstream media -- only cover Al Gore 's ' Earth has a fever ' perspective . "
Dan Gainor , director of the Business and Media Institute , joined Doocy and Brian Kilmeade to tell them about the " International Conference on Climate Change " currently being held in New York , which " proves that the consensus theory that Al Gore 's been pushing , that the mainstream media have been pushing for years -- it 's all bogus . "
Doocy suggested that the warming observed over the last century could be just " a big cycle " and that " this is the worst winter in some parts of America and around the world and perhaps we should be worried now about global cooling . "
Gainor went on to note that the New York Times had done a " somewhat sarcastic " piece on the conference .
" Disagreement 's not allowed in the media , " he complained .
" We just did a report looking at how the network news shows have covered climate change .
... 13 to one , the people they put on are on one side saying it 's not a debate .
... On CBS it 's 38 to one . "
The Business and Media Institute ( BMI ) is a project of the Media Research Center ( MRC ) , headed by well - known movement conservative L. Brent Bozell .
MRC has received substantial funding from ExxonMobil , as has the Heartland Institute , sponsor of the conference .
Dan Gainor is both the Director of BMI and MRC's " Boone Pickens Free Market Fellow " a position apparently named for the legendary Texas oilman and corporate raider .
As well as decrying global warming " alarmism , " Gainor makes frequent appearances on Fox to insist that the New York Times is losing revenue because it is too liberal , that media warnings of an oncoming recession are " hype , " that consumer debt is the fault of spendthrift borrowers , or that predictions of four dollar a gallon gasoline are scare - mongering .

The Mena Connection
By Jean Duffey
Question :
What is more important than holding the killers of Kevin Ives and Don Henry accountable ?
Answer : Protecting the legacy of three U.S. Presidents .
Question :
Now that the criminal complicity of these presidents has been exposed and is not disputable , what is the justification for continuing to protect the killers ?
Answer :
There is none , not that there ever was .
Below is a fact sheet of mostly circumstantial evidence that the murders of Kevin and Don are linked to Mena .
According to Paula Casey , Arkansas U.S. Attorney ( 1983 to 2000 ) , circumstantial evidence is good evidence .
PAULA CASEY’S COMMENT : TUESDAY , APRIL 14 , 1998
KARN NEWS -920
REPORTER :
“ Circumstantial evidence is what you brought against Mr. Harmon this time .
That did n’t seem to make a difference to the jury .
They only deliberated for an hour . ”
PAULA CASEY : “ Well there was some direct evidence in the case , but a lot of it was circumstantial evidence .
But , circumstantial evidence is still evidence and it can be very compelling . ”
That ’s what she says , but Paula Casey refuses to even look at , much less consider , the cumulative evidence that connects at least two Saline County murders to the crimes of Mena .
But then , maybe she already knows and is doing her part to thwart justice .
But , remember , there is no statute of limitations on murder .
The Circumstantial Evidence
Reports to authorities of low - flying planes along rural Saline County train tracks late at night were ignored .
Residents around a mile - stretch of tracks described activities of low - flying , small engine planes , coming from the direction of a well - lighted Children ’s Colony , lining up with the tracks , slowing to stall speed with their lights off for a few seconds , then revving back up to fly away .
Witnesses speculated that these occurrences were drug drops , and several reported them to Saline County Sheriff authorities , but no investigator ever followed up even to feign interest .
A reasonable assumption might be that the residents were witnessing illegal drug drops protected by law enforcement .
August 23 , 1987 , Kevin and Don were murdered in the same area of the plane activity , and their bodies were laid across the tracks for a a train to run over .
The cover -ups began immediately .
The initial investigation , conducted by the Saline County Sheriff James Steed was the worst orchestrated sham imaginable .
The murders made for sensational news and there was such a public outcry that Judge John Cole impaneled a county grand jury .
Knowing that attorney Dan Harmon participated in the murders , Cole appointed him to head the investigation in order to control it .
To make it look like he was cleaning up Saline County , Harmon indicted several drug dealers and dirty cops with which he was at odds .
Harmon was hailed a hero , but actually witnesses and informants who had information about the murders of Kevin and Don were murdered themselves .
So far , two investigations went nowhere .
Then a state police investigation went south .
Linda could n’t grasp the incompetency or whatever it was that was happening .
In 1990 , Jean Duffey ’s drug task force began a legitimate investigation but Jean and her investigator , Scott , realized that an investigation of a drug operation using planes was beyond the capability of their small task force .
Jean knew that Assistant U.S. Attorney Bob Govar was leading a federal grand jury investigation of drug trafficking and public official corruption in Saline County , so she made an appointment to visit Govar .
Instead of meeting Govar , Jean and Scott were ushered in to see Govar ’s boss , Chuck Banks .
Scott showed Banks an aerial map of the tracks , the path of the plane activity , and witness statements .
This apparently turned out to be a warning to Banks that the task force might expose Mena , and neither Govar nor the grand jury heard the information .
An orchestrated massive media smear campaign was soon launched against Jean .
John
Cole issued illegal felony warrants for her arrest on bogus charges and said he would deny her to bond out when arrested , so Jean went into hiding .
There was also a purported $ 50,000 on Jean ’s head so even when Cole was forced to withdraw the warrants when confronted with Jean ’s Motion stating the law , Jean chose to stay in hiding to await the imminent indictments promised by Govar .
While in hiding , an Arkansas Gazette reporter , Chris Day , called Jean to tell her what he learned from a high - level informant .
It was too absurd for Jean to believe , but it actually happened the way Chris said it would .
Chuck Banks shut down Govar ’s two - year - long federal grand jury investigation and cleared all Saline County public officials of corruption and any other wrong - doing .
In return , President George H.W. Bush rewarded Banks with a federal judgeship nomination .
Although circumstantial , this evidence is HUGE !
What reason would a sitting U.S. President have for interjecting himself into an investigation of corrupt county officials in Arkansas ?
That would , of course , have to be because an investigation would expose something that had to do with national security , a secret government operation , terrorism , or maybe something like illegal activity at the highest level .
A secret government operation and illegal activity at the highest level both fit the circumstances .
In spite of efforts by Harmon and Cole to put Jean away , Jean was cleared .
Linda had figured out the evils of Harmon , so Linda and Jean finally met and began working together .
The Mena connection was made for them .
For Jean , it was the interjection of President Bush .
For Linda it was a tape she got from Arkansas State Trooper Detective Russell Welch in Mena .
The tape was barely audible then , and is completely inaudible now , but it is an interview with a prison inmate who said that the drug drops in Saline County came from Mena .
Covering up the crimes of Mena is what has always made the most sense .
It is , in fact , the only thing that has ever made sense .
Linda and Jean shared task force files with John Brown , a deputy who worked a short time for Saline County Sheriff Judy Pridgon .
The files contained Scott ’s interviews of residents around the tracks who suspicioned the plane activity was drug drops .
An informant gave John information on a pilot named “ Joe ” who claimed to have dropped cocaine and money at the same stretch of track .
“ Joe ” was located and interviewed by John Brown and corroborated the residents description of the plane activities .
“ Joe ” described how the lights from the nearby “ children ’s colony ” directed him to the tracks .
“ Joe ” said he lined up with the tracks and used railroad lights that hung horizontally on an arm to mark where to kick the packages out of a small sliding door by his feet .
However , when John walked the tracks , there were no such railroad lights .
Chalking it up as disinformation John moved on .
Some time later , John was telling Linda and Larry the story .
Larry , a train engineer , had run those tracks for years and said that the lights did hang horizontally on an arm at the time the boys were killed but had been changed recently to stand vertically .
John Brown later turned against Linda and Jean .
They do n’t know why .
Was he threatened ?
Was he blackmailed ?
They just do n’t know , but they were on their own again .
Jean found “ Joe ” in Amarillo , Texas and drove there to interview him .
“ Joe ” showed Jean copies of paystubs from the U.S. Treasury and several other official - looking documents , but “ Joe ’s “ real name was redacted , and Jean could not verify that “ Joe ” was a “ contract pilot ” for the CIA as he claimed , but she found “ Joe ” to be sincere and appropriately cautious , and she tended to believe him .
Finally , “ Joe ” insisted that the “ packages ” he flew to various locations were driven to Waco in freight trucks and the truck drivers said they were picked up from a small airport in Mena , Arkansas .
There did n’t seem to be much reason for “ Joe ” to make up such a story , but Jean had to leave it at that and move on .
On July 26 , 1998 , Mark Keesee , the original webmaster of ID Files , got three e-mail death threats that were routed through Thailand and bizarrely dated July 26 , 2000 .
This is as direct as evidence can get .
The homepage of idfiles.com stated , “ police officers murdered [ Kevin and Don ] because they witnessed a police - protected drug drop .
The drop was part of a drug smuggling operation based at a small airport in Mena , Arkansas . ”
The logical assumption is that the website might expose the crimes of Mena .
Mark reported the threat to the Little Rock FBI Bureau who , according to FBI Bureaus in Houston and in Sacramento , ignored normal procedure and went to the U.S. Attorney Paula Casey before investigating the threat .
Paula Casey declined to prosecute .
So , did Casey decline to prosecute because the FBI did not investigate and she had no one to prosecute or did Casey tell the FBI not to bother to investigate because she was n’t going to prosecute ?
Either way , it smells of complicity .
There are many parallels between the investigations of Mena and the investigations of Saline County , not the least of which are the 4 legitimate investigators who refused to quit even when ordered .
The thwarted investigations had proximity of time , location , and method .
Both Mena and Saline County had upwards of 7 investigations , from the local to the federal level , shut down by higher authorities .
Each location had two legitimate investigators , who refused to let go , so were discredited , investigated , fired , threatened , and worse .
In Mena : Arkansas State Trooper Investigator , Russel Welch , who refused to back off was send weapons - grade anthrax and very nearly died .
He retired but continued to investigate .
IRS investigator Bill Duncan refused to back off .
His career and personal life were destroyed .
In Saline County : Saline County Drug Task Force Director Jean Duffey ignored directives to turn a blind eye on corruption and was smeared in the media , had $ 50,000 on her head , and had her law license revoked .
FBI Special Agent Phyllis Cournan , had to fight the “ good ol ’ boys ” at every turn .
She was harassed , discredited , and finally fired .
She has been too afraid to talk .
U.S. Attorney Asa Hutchinson thwarted Bill Duncan ’s investigation of Barry Seal for tax crimes .
In August , 2017 , Governor Asa Hutchinson appointed Kirk Lane as Arkansas State Drug Czar .
According to the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals , Lane is a prime suspect in the murders of Kevin and Don .
After Barry Seal was assassinated , his ex-brother - in - law and first pilot , Billy Bottoms , became an internet detractor , calling any illegal activity at Mena a “ hoax ” and any drug activity a “ myth . ”
Bottoms directed most of his communication to Detective Welch and a great deal to Linda and Jean .
One thing was certain .
If Bottoms said something happened at Mena , it did n’t .
If he said something did n’t happen at Mena , it did .
And he ’s still at it .
Just this summer ( 2019 ) Bottoms sent a message to Jean through Barry ’s widow , Debbie Seal , that drugs from Mena never , never went to Saline County .
So which is it ?
No drugs in Mena or no drugs from Mena went to Saline County ?
The above is merely a summary of the cumulative evidence , but the complete story is within these pages of ID Files .
Make up your own mind about whether the evidence is compelling enough to warrant a legitimate investigation , which has never happened .
The Arkansas Bureau of the FBI , the Arkansas U.S. Attorneys , the Arkansas State Police , seven Saline County Sheriffs , and the Benton City Police have all had multiple opportunities to conduct forthright investigations , but have n’t .
We ’re certainly not suggesting a Congressional investigation .
Every American knows those things never produce competent results , although costing millions of dollars .
It appears that there is nowhere to seek justice .
Perhaps the best evidence ( although circumstantial ) is the complete lack of evidence .
Of the 2000 FBI documents obtained through an FOIA request , not one mentions Mena .
This is curious , since Jean and Linda talked to Special Agent Phyllis Cournan at length about their beliefs that the murders are connected to Mena .
It is made clear within those 2000 documents that cops were involved in the murders of Kevin and Don , that public officials participated in cover-ups , that sham investigations were conducted by authorities , and that legitimate investigators were discredited , but not one word about Mena .
There are an admitted 15,000 withheld FBI documents .
What could those documents possibly hold that cannot be released after 32 years since the murders and decades after every investigation has been shut down .
The absence of information is certainly circumstantial evidence but it speaks loudly .
Let ’s speculate for a moment that a high - level connection to the Clinton ’s has come forward .
( IT ’S NOT THE EX - WRESTLER .
LINDA AND JEAN HAVE SET HIM ASIDE , PENDING THE OUTCOME OF A LAWSUIT AGAINST , KEITH ROUNSAVAL , THE PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR WHO FOUND AND FALSELY PROMOTED HIM . )
This would be someone completely unexpected but absolutely legitimate , who knows that money was being dropped on that mile - stretch of tracks and taken to Bill .
Where would Linda and Jean take him / her if they want to assure his / her safety ?
Is there absolutely nowhere ?
Because the murders are connected to Mena , there is not .

Edi­tor ’s Note : Below you have a very insight­ful arti­cle on stress by Gre­go­ry Kel­let , a researcher at UCSF .
Enjoy !
— — — — — — — — ———————-
“ My brain is fried , toast , fraz­zled , burnt out .
How many times have you said or heard one ver­sion or anoth­er of these state­ments .
Most of us think we are being fig­u­ra­tive when we utter such phras­es , but research shows that the bio­log­i­cal con­se­quences of sus­tained high lev­els of stress may have us being more accu­rate than we would like to think .
Crash Course on Stress
Our bod­ies are a com­plex bal­anc­ing act between sys­tems work­ing full time to keep us alive and well .
This bal­anc­ing act is con­stant­ly adapt­ing to the myr­i­ad of changes occur­ring every sec­ond with­in our­selves and our envi­ron­ments .
When it gets dark our pupils dilate , when we get hot we sweat , when we smell food we sali­vate , and so forth .
This con­stant bal­anc­ing act main­tains a range of sta­bil­i­ty in the body via change ; and is often referred to as allosta­sis .
Any change which threat­ens this bal­ance can be referred to as allo­sta­t­ic load or stress .
Allo­sta­t­ic load / stress is part of being alive .
For exam­ple just by get­ting up in the morn­ing , we all expe­ri­ence a very impor­tant need to increase our heart rate and blood pres­sure in order to feed our new­ly ele­vat­ed brain .
Although usu­al­ly man­age­able , this is a change which the body needs to adapt to and , by our def­i­n­i­tion , a stres­sor .
Stress is only a prob­lem when this allo­sta­t­ic load becomes over­load .
When change is exces­sive or our abil­i­ty to adapt is com­pro­mised , things start to go wrong .
We will focus here on what seems to be hap­pen­ing in the brain under such con­di­tions .
Ener­gy Mobi­liza­tion
Whether it ’s get­ting up in the morn­ing , wor­ry­ing about the non-exis­tent past / future , or get­ting angry at your last park­ing tick­et , stress takes ener­gy .
One of the major roles of the infa­mous fight or flight response is to mobi­lize ener­gy , and it does this well .
If you need to run away from a swarm of killer bees or fend off an attack­ing bear , you will be assist­ed by var­i­ous chem­i­cals pro­duced with­in the body .
These include the well - known adrenaline–now more com­mon­ly referred to as epinephrine–and a less­er known group of chem­i­cals known as the glu­co­cor­ti­coids , most notably cor­ti­sol .
Both epi­neph­rine and the glu­co­cor­ti­coids are involved in mak­ing stored ener­gy avail­able for use in the form of fats and sug­ars .
Epi­neph­rine does so over the short term ( with­in sec­onds ) while glu­co­cor­ti­coids act over a longer peri­od ( min­utes to hours ) .
Let ’s look at the effects of the lat­er of the two , the glu­co­cor­ti­coids .
Your Brain on Stress
Cor­ti­sol , the most promi­nent of the glu­co­cor­ti­coids , does an excel­lent job of allow­ing us to adapt to most stres­sors which last more than a cou­ple of min­utes but under an hour .
Short term it will actu­al­ly enhance our immune sys­tem , mem­o­ry and atten­tion .
Long term , past ½ hour to an hour , exces­sive­ly ele­vat­ed cor­ti­sol lev­els start to have detri­men­tal effects .
It seems we were designed more to deal with short spurts of high stress , such as beat­ing back that attack­ing bear , rather than long drawn - out stres­sors such as meet­ing dead­lines .
Our brains appear to be most vul­ner­a­ble to the effects of exces­sive stress in a region called the hip­pocam­pus .
The hip­pocam­pus is a mass of neu­rons each with mul­ti­ple branch - like exten­sions ( den­drites and axons ) which make con­nec­tions ( synaps­es ) with oth­er neu­rons all across the brain .
Among oth­er things , this region is impor­tant in deal­ing with emo­tions and con­sol­i­dat­ing new mem­o­ries .
As with all brain regions , its abil­i­ty to adapt relies upon being able to alter the branch­ing and con­nec­tions of its neu­rons .
The hip­pocam­pus is also one of the only regions of the brain known to be able to pro­duce new neu­rons , a process called neu­ro­ge­n­e­sis .
Brain Dam­age
Endur­ing a high stres­sor for more than 30 min­utes to an hour has been shown to neg­a­tive­ly impact the hip­pocam­pus in var­i­ous ways .
To begin , sus­tained expo­sure to high­er than nor­mal lev­els of cor­ti­sol results in the prun­ing back of the num­ber of branch­es and synap­tic con­nec­tions of hip­pocam­pal neu­rons .
By a vari­ety of mech­a­nisms , these con­di­tions also increase the rate of cell death in this region of the brain .
As if this was ­ n’t bad enough , recent research is also demon­strat­ing that sus­tained increas­es in glu­co­cor­ti­coid lev­els also has neg­a­tive effects , impair­ing the hip­pocam­pus ’s abil­i­ty to cre­ate new neu­rons .
Over a peri­od of time , all of this results in the shrink­ing in size of the hip­pocam­pus with asso­ci­at­ed declines in cog­ni­tive func­tion , includ­ing the abil­i­ty to retain new infor­ma­tion and adapt to nov­el sit­u­a­tions .
Dam­age Con­trol
For­tu­nate­ly the neg­a­tive effects of exces­sive stress can not only be stopped but also reversed once the source ( psy­cho­log­i­cal or phys­i­cal ) is removed or suf­fi­cient­ly reduced .
Next time we will explore tech­niques one can use to pro­tect our brains by man­ag­ing the unavoid­able stres­sors we all face as part of being human .
— Gre­go­ry Kel­lett has a mas­ters in Cog­ni­tive Neurology / Research Psy­chol­o­gy from SFSU and is a researcher at UCSF where he cur­rent­ly inves­ti­gates the psy­chophys­i­ol­o­gy of social stress .
They are among Britain 's wealthiest businessmen , with access to the heart of Downing Street .
Yet little has been known about the elite group of multinational chairmen , or exactly what they talk about during their breakfast meetings with the prime minister .
Until now , that is .
Downing Street documents disclosed to the Guardian reveal how the secretive lobbying group , which consists of the heads of Britain 's most powerful corporations , including BP , Unilever , HSBC , Shell and British American Tobacco ( BAT ) , have used their private access to protect the pensions of the ultra-rich .
The exclusive club , known as the multi-national chairmen 's group , consists of fewer than 10 executives .
Its members are invited to Downing Street to tell the prime minister how they believe government policies are affecting international corporations .
Downing Street has been forced to release the prime ministerial documents after a two - year battle over freedom of information .
They show the executives :
· outmanoeuvred Gordon Brown , then chancellor , to shield " fat cat " pensions from his proposals to tax them more heavily ;
· wanted Tony Blair , then prime minister , to lobby George Bush to treat corporations more favourably in return for supporting the invasion of Iraq ;
· and lobbied for less " burdensome " red tape so multinational corporations would continue basing themselves in Britain .
The behind - the - scenes personal approach to Blair helped persuade the government to back down on Brown 's plans to tax the pensions of super - high earners more punitively .
More " business - friendly " measures were then brought in .
These allow a few highly paid executives to amass tax - free pension funds of up to £ 1.8 m .
Audio , Rob Evans : ' From the very very top multinationals '
Originally Brown proposed a 60 % tax on pension pots above £ 1.4 m .
The Treasury had estimated the new tax would hit only 5,000 wealthy people , although others argued many more would be affected .
Seemingly impervious to the business arguments , Brown was refusing to water down his proposals .
So nine businessmen in the group sought to go over the chancellor 's head at one of the meetings with Blair on September 2 2003 .
Before the meeting , Geoff Norris , Blair 's special adviser on business , had briefed the prime minister .
He wrote : " The group had raised concerns with the Treasury on the £ 1.4 m earnings limit and received a fairly unpromising reply ...
They would like to discuss with the prime minister whether there was any prospect of movement on this issue ... "
He said the group was worried that " recent policy pronouncements on pensions and speculation about possible tax rises have all contributed to a sense that the business - friendly emphasis of the government is fading " .
The executives at the meeting , including Lord Browne , then of BP , Arun Sarin of Vodafone , Sir John Bond , then of HSBC , and Sir Christopher Hogg , then of GlaxoSmithKline , claimed the proposals would drive businessmen away from Britain .
Martin Broughton , one - time head of BAT , told the Guardian : " Tax issues regularly featured in these meetings as being a key issue for international companies determining where to base their business . "
Niall Fitzgerald , head of Unilever at the time , said the proposed tax would have made it " increasingly difficult to attract the best and brightest from around the world to work in the UK with consequent negative effects on the UK's competitiveness and the UK's attractiveness as a location for international companies " .
The lobbying , allied with protests from other business groups , forced Brown to rethink .
Within a few months , he had loosened the proposed cap on their pension pots so that more of their money would escape the tax net .
The extra tax will only be payable on pension savings over £ 1.8 m , not the originally proposed £ 1.4 m , and will not come in until 2010 .
He delayed the start date of the new regime to give the rich more time to re-arrange their finances .
He also reduced the tax rate from 60 % to 55 % .
The super - rich can thus shelter an extra £ 400,000 from the taxman - at Brown 's original proposed 60 % tax , that sum would have incurred a £ 240,000 tax bill .
The executives who attended the meeting say the rule changes do not benefit them personally , as the provisions only applied to future pension pots and their own pensions were already in place .
Downing Street released the heavily censored documents after Richard Thomas , the information commissioner , ruled that the public had a right to know how lobbyists influenced ministers .
The briefing by Norris also shows that in 2003 , the businessmen believed Blair was not extracting as much as he could from Bush 's administration in return for supporting the invasion of Iraq .
They wanted Blair to lobby Bush more vigorously to allay worries about , for instance , tighter regulation of corporations and tax changes .
The executives also wanted to persuade Blair not to bring in tougher rules after the scandals involving Enron and other American corporations .
South Korea ( TGW ) – British tidal power company Lunar Energy has agreed to build the world ’s largest tidal power system in South Korea .
The $ 1 billion project will use power from fast - moving tidal streams , caused by rising and falling tides , to turn a field of 300 60 ft - high tidal turbines on the sea floor .
The project is expected to power 200,000 homes by 2015 .
William Law , chairman of Lunar Energy , said that there was the potential around the British coast for tidal stream turbines to generate up to 20 % of Britain 's energy needs .

Orgasms may work unimaginable miracles with human body
Sexual abstinence is out of fashion nowadays .
Researchers refer to numerous experiments and propagandize regular and even frequent sex life for health and rejuvenation .
Is sex really so wholesome ?
Orgasms may work unimaginable miracles with human body
We addressed this question to Alexander Poleyev , Candidate of Medical Sciences and Professor of the Institute of Psychoanalysis with the Moscow State University .
“ Sex protects and strengthens cardiac muscles .
Experts with the British Royal University proved it after they had examined a group of men leading sexually active lives .
It turned out that they had a much lower risk of having either heart attacks or strokes thanks to hormones which an act of love generates .
Doctors recommend those who suffered an infarction or a stroke to have a regular sex life .
For them hormones act as a medication .
They produce a healing effect on the whole body , improve digestion and expand blood vessels .
Rhythmic motion during sex and delightful cramps improve the muscle tone , especially stomach muscles , ” the scientist said .
Experts with the Royal University of Belfast have recently finished an interesting research .
They examined the interdependence between the general state of health and the frequency of sexual contacts .
Scientists analyzed the death rate data of about 1,000 average - aged men during ten years .
It proved that men who had more orgasms died less frequently than those who did not make love at all .
Regular sex reduces the risk of breast cancer with women and prostate cancer with men .
Scientists from Wilkes University , Pennsylvania , found out that people making love regularly have 30 percent more antibodies called immunoglobulin A that strengthens the immune system .
So they catch cold rarer than those who refrain from sex .
- Can people lose weight making love ?
- Sure , they can .
Even if sex lasts for 4.5 minutes ( the average duration ) , the body burns off the same amount of calories as during 15 minutes of jogging .
But usually people go into the kitchen immediately to restore these calories .
- Is it true that sex relieves pain better than analgin ?
- No doubt .
It is sheer chemistry .
Before orgasm the oxytocin level is five times above the norm .
The brain discharges it in the blood .
As the result , the hormone controls the body temperature , blood pressure and dulls pain .
It was discovered in the 1970s by Doctor Beverly Whipple who also found the so - called G - spot , the erogenous zone in the vagina .
Whipple proved that a certain amount of pressure showed on this spot raises the level of hormones , which subsequently increases the pain barrier by 40 percent .
During orgasm women may experience insufferable tortures .
This is what sadomasochists use when they whip and spank each other .
Doctor Beverly aroused women with the help of porn movies and masturbation .
She simultaneously examined their brain activity through tomography .
It turned out that the hormones that accompany sexual pleasure activate the antipain centre in the middle brain .
The centre sends signals to discharge special substances – corticosteroids that decrease the vulnerability of nerve endings .
Pain stimulates the release of oxytocin , which creates delightful sensations .
The similar processes occur in the male organism .
Thus , sex affects brains and deprives people of any pain – migraine or arthritis .
- Can Kama Sutra heal injuries ?
- No kidding .
Swedish scientists have recently discovered that sex really exerts a healing influence thanks to oxytocin .
Lab mice were injured first and then were injected with this hormone .
The wounds healed twice as fast .
- Why do the French call orgasm ‘ a little death ’ ?
- Because it helps to postpone the real death .
Orgasm causes cramps , thus all the congested cavities get cleaned .
For example , pathogens that cause inflammation in the uterus pouch are eliminated .
- Statistics show that one third of Russian women do not experience orgasms .
So they do not receive their share of health ?
- That is right , but they can partially reduce this loss by moving actively and screaming .
The twitching of the glottis and bronchi gives a powerful wholesome effect : women who scream during sex rarely suffer from lung diseases – bronchitis and pneumonia .
That is why the louder they scream , the better .
But we should not forget that humans may want just hugging at times .
It is a biological need .
Our organs of senses are above five million mechanoreceptors – tactile cells that cover our skin , especially lips and fingertips .
Stroking and pressing cause changes on the biological level .
Impulses are converted from cutaneous receptors to the cortex , then to the hypothalamus that stimulates the release of special hormones ( prolactin that suppresses aggression and endorphin that relieves stress ) .
So love each other tenderly !

Often what is hidden in our world is so simply because no cares or thinks to look .
Yes , a fair amount of attention has recently been given to the staggering new Pentagon budget request , the largest since World War II , that the Bush administration has just submitted to Congress for fiscal year 2009 .
It comes in at $ 515.4 billion  a 7.5 percent hike for an already bloated Pentagon  and that does n’t include all sorts of Defense Department funds that will be stowed away elsewhere ( even if in plain sight ) , nor does it include the couple of hundred billion dollars or more in funds to be appropriated largely via “ supplemental ” requests for the ongoing military disasters in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Even the official budget , however , includes staggering sums for procuring major new weapons systems and for R&D leading to ever more such big - ticket items in the future .
According to Steve Kosiak , vice president of budget studies at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments , “ The fiscal year 2009 budget may be about as good as it gets for defense contractors . ”
When all is said and done , this will probably be a trillion dollar “ defense ” budget .
As it happens , military budgets like this have a multiplier effect globally .
After all , there ’s no such thing as a one - nation arms race .
It ’s just that no one here thinking about what we ’re about to feed the Pentagon pays much attention to such things .
Fortunately , John Feffer , an expert on military policy and Asia , has been doing just that .
He is the co-director of a particularly interesting Web site , Foreign Policy in Focus at the Institute for Policy Studies in Washington , with which TomDispatch hopes to collaborate on projects in the future .
( To subscribe to FPIF ’s e-news service , click here . )
In the following piece , he brings genuine arms - race news to all of us .
Yes , Virginia , there is indeed an arms race underway ; it ’s taking off in Northeast Asia ; and it ’s dangerous .

Asia ’s Hidden Arms Race
Six countries talk peace while preparing for war
by John Feffer
Read all about it !
Diplomats remain upbeat about solving the nuclear standoff with North Korea ; optimists envision a peace treaty to replace the armistice that halted , but failed to formally end , the Korean War 55 years ago .
Some leaders and scholars are even urging the transformation of the Six Party Talks over the Korean nuclear issue , involving the United States , Japan , China , Russia , and the two Koreas , into a permanent peace structure in Northeast Asia .
The countries in the region all seem determined to make nice right now .
Yasuo Fukuda , the new Japanese prime minister , is considerably more pacific than his predecessor , the ultra-nationalist Shinzo Abe .
The new South Korean president , Lee Myung - bak , despite his conservative credentials , is committed to continuing the previous president ’s engagement policy with North Korea and plans to reach out to Japan via his first post - inaugural state visit .
The party that won the recent Taiwanese parliamentary elections , the Kuomintang , wants to rebuild bridges to the Mainland and , when it comes to the Communist Party there , mend fences the ruling Democratic Progressive Party tried to pull down .
Beijing , for its part , is being super - conciliatory toward practically everyone in this Olympic year .
Despite all this peace - talk , something else , quite momentous and hardly noticed , is underway in the region .
The real money in Northeast Asia is going elsewhere .
While in the news sunshine prevails , in the shadows an already massive regional arms race is threatening to shift into overdrive .
Since the dawn of the 21st century , five of the six countries involved in the Six Party Talks have increased their military spending by 50 percent or more .
The sixth , Japan , has maintained a steady , if sizable military budget while nonetheless aspiring to keep pace .
Every country in the region is now eagerly investing staggering amounts of money in new weapons systems and new offensive capabilities .
The arms race in Northeast Asia undercuts all talk of peace in the region .
It also sustains a growing global military - industrial complex .
Northeast Asia is where four of the world ’s largest militaries  those of the United States , China , Russia , and Japan  confront each other .
Together , the countries participating in the Six Party Talks account for approximately 65 percent of world military expenditures , with the United States responsible for roughly half the global total .
Here is the real news that should hit the front pages of papers today : Wars grip Iraq , Afghanistan , and large swathes of Africa , but the heart of the global military - industrial complex lies in Northeast Asia .
Any attempt to drive a stake through this potentially destabilizing monster must start with the militaries that face one another there .
The Japanese Reversal
The Northeast Asian arms buildup  a three - tiered scramble to dominate the seas , beef up air forces , and control the next frontier of space  runs counter to conventional wisdom .
After all , is n’t Japan still operating under a “ peace constitution ” ?
Has n’t South Korea committed to the peaceful reunification of the Korean peninsula ?
Did n’t China recently wake up to the virtues of soft power ?
And how could North Korea and Russia , both of which suffered disastrous economic reversals in the 1990s , have had the wherewithal to compete in an arms race ?
As it turns out , these obstacles have proved little more than speed bumps on the road to regional hyper-militarism .
Perhaps the most paradoxical participant in this new arms race is Japan .
Its famous peace constitution has traditionally been one of the few brakes on arms spending in the region .
The country has long limited its military expenditures to an informal ceiling of 1 percent of its overall budget .
As that budget grew , however , so did military spending .
Japan ’s army is now larger than Britain ’s , and the country spends more on its military than all but four other nations .
( China surpassed Japan in military spending for the first time in 2006 . )
Nonetheless , for decades , the provisions of its peace constitution at least put limits on the offensive capabilities of the Japanese military , which is still referred to as its Self - Defense Forces .
These days , however , even the definition of “ offensive ” is changing .
In 1999 , the country ’s Self - Defense Forces first used offensive force when its naval vessels fired on suspected North Korean spy ships .
Less than a decade later , Japan provides support far from its “ defensive ” zone for U.S. wars , including providing fuel to coalition forces in Afghanistan and transport in Iraq .
Japan was once incapable of bombing other countries largely because its air force did n’t have an in - air refueling capability .
Thanks to Boeing , however , the first KC - 767 tanker aircraft will arrive in Japan later this year , providing government officials , who occasionally assert the country ’s right to launch preemptive strikes , with the means to do so .
This is not happy news for Japan ’s neighbors , who retain vivid memories of the 1930s and 1940s , when its military went on an imperial rampage throughout the region .
Tokyo already has among the best air forces and naval fighting forces in the world , trailing only the United States .
But leading Japanese officials have displayed an even larger appetite .
Some Japanese politicians are lobbying to amend the peace constitution or even scrap it entirely , while sending military spending skyrocketing .
To promote these ideas , they use the thin rationale that Japan should be participating regularly in “ international peacekeeping missions . ”
The Japanese Defense Agency  their Pentagon  which was upgraded to ministry level last year , wants more goodies like an aircraft carrier , nuclear - powered submarines , and long - range missiles .
A light aircraft carrier , which the government has coyly labeled a “ destroyer , ” will be ready in 2009 .
The subs and missiles , however , will have to wait .
So , too , will Tokyo ’s attempt to take a quantum leap forward in air - fighting capabilities by importing advanced U.S. F - 22 stealth planes .
Concerned about releasing latest - generation technology to the outside world , Congress scotched this deal at the last moment in August 2007 .
Washington has been a good deal more accommodating when it comes to missile defense .
Japan has been a far more enthusiastic supporter of missile defense than any of America ’s European allies .
In fact , the United States and Japan are spending billions of dollars to set up an early - warning - and - response prototype of such an advanced missile system .
Part of this missile shield is land - based .
Last month , Japan installed its third Patriot Advanced Capability - 3 ( PAC - 3 ) surface - to - air interceptor and plans on nine more by 2011 .
The more ambitious part of the program , however , is based at sea .
In December , Japan conducted its first sea - based interceptor test .
With Japan and the United States in the lead , a space race is also on in Northeast Asia .
Last year , China tested its own anti-ballistic missile system by shooting down one of its old weather satellites .
While at present this is far from an actual missile - defense system , China effectively served notice that it is up to the technological challenge of hitting a bullet with a bullet in space .
Meanwhile , thanks to U.S. pressure Russia too is upgrading its missile defense systems , while pouring money into the development of new missiles that can bypass any putative shield the U.S. and its allies can develop .
Give Me Peace , but Not Just Yet
The two most recent South Korean presidents , Nobel Peace Prize winner Kim Dae-Jung and the left - leaning Roh Moo -Hyun , have been well - known for their efforts to foster reconciliation with North Korea .
Less well - known have been their programs to beef up South Korea ’s military .
The dark side of their engagement policy has been its unstated quid pro quo of satisfying the security concerns of South Korean hawks by giving their military everything it wants  and then some .
Between 1999 and 2006 , South Korean military spending jumped more than 70 percent .
In 2007 , at the launching ceremony for a new Aegis - equipped destroyer , which brought South Korea into an elite club of just five countries with such technology , President Roh Moo -Hyun declared , “ At the present time , Northeast Asia is still in an arms race , and we can not just sit back and watch . ”
By 2020 , the South Korean navy wants to build three more Aegis destroyers at a cost of $ 1 billion each .
South Korean hawks are not only responding to concerns about North Korea , the traditional threat around which the South has organized its military .
They are concerned about a declining military commitment from the United States , which has reduced the levels of American troops that traditionally garrison the country and pushed hard for greater military “ burden - sharing . ”
South Korea ’s leaders and military officials are anxious that the Pentagon may continue to focus on the Middle East and Central Asia to the exclusion of its Pacific commitments .
To prepare for the contingency of going it alone , South Korea has embarked on an ambitious $ 665 billion Defense Reform 2020 initiative , which will increase the military budget by roughly 10 percent a year until 2020 .
In those years , while troop levels will actually fall , most of the extra money will go to a host of expensive , high - tech systems such as new F - 15 K fighters from Boeing , SM - 6 ship - to - air missiles that can form a low - altitude missile shield , and Global Hawk unmanned aerial vehicles .
If South Korea ’s spending spree remains largely under the radar , China ’s military expenditures have received considerable media scrutiny .
Newspaper accounts have focused on China ’s military spending , which officially rose to $ 45 billion for 2007 .
However , that public figure , according to U.S. intelligence estimates , tells only half the story .
Beijing ’s spending , claim these sources , is really in the $ 100 billion range .
With this money , China is pushing forward with an ambitious naval program that will include the addition to its naval forces of five new nuclear - powered attack subs , a mid-sized aircraft carrier , and  clandestinely  the supposed construction of a huge 93,000 - ton nuclear - powered carrier by 2020 .
Lost in the hype around China ’s apparent quest for a world - class military to match its world - class economy are the gaps in the country ’s offensive capabilities .
It has only a couple of hundred nuclear weapons and fewer than two dozen ICBMs pointed at the United States .
Its navy does n’t have a “ blue - water ” capability , lacking ( as yet ) any aircraft carriers , a large force of nuclear - powered submarines , and the overseas basing infrastructure to support them .
It relies heavily on imports and ca n’t yet build the sort of aircraft that would allow it to project serious force over large distances .
China , however , has been the only modestly credible threat on the horizon that the Pentagon has been able to wield to justify military spending at levels not seen since World War II .
The Pentagon ca n’t use its big naval destroyers against al - Qaeda ; Virginia - class subs ca n’t do much to fight the Taliban or insurgents in Iraq .
Yet these systems figure prominently in the Pentagon ’s long - range plans to build a 313 - ship navy .
Congressman John Murtha ( D - Pa. ) , who made headlines back in 2005 with his newfound opposition to the Iraq War , is typical of congressional hawks when he warns of the need to prepare for a coming conflict with China .
“ We ’ve got to be able to have a military that can deploy to stop China or Russia or any other country that challenges us , ” he recently told Reuters .
“ I ’ve felt we had to be concerned about the direction China was going . ”
To counter China , the United States has pursued a classic containment strategy of strengthening military ties with India , Australia , the Philippines , and Japan .
The Bush administration trumpets its accomplishment of increasing military spending 74 percent since 2001 .
In addition to the $ 12.7 billion for new warships , there ’s $ 17 billion for new aircraft and over $ 10 billion for missile defense .
The administration wants to increase the Army from 482,400 to 547,400 troops by 2012 .
A sizable portion of the administration ’s $ 607 billion Pentagon budget request for 2009 , which does n’t even include massive supplemental funding for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , will go to maintaining and expanding the U.S. military presence in the Pacific .
The Democratic front - runners for the presidential nomination have also called for troop increases and have said nothing about slowing , freezing , or even cutting the military budget .
No matter who is elected , under the next administration , as under the last one , the United States will surely continue to be the chief driver of global arms spending .
The Armies of Austerity
Increased military spending is not always just a function of affluence .
As the Russian economy contracted in the 1990s , the arms export industry became an ever more critical way for the faltering country to earn hard currency .
Today , flush with oil and natural gas revenues , Russia has regained its place as the world ’s second largest arms dealer by almost doubling its arms exports since 2000 .
Washington ’s moves to establish a global missile defense system and encroach on Russian interests in Central Asia have only encouraged Moscow to boost its military spending in an effort to recover its lost superpower status .
With the renewed growth of the Russian economy on the strength of energy sales , Russian arms expenditures began to take off again in the new millennium , increasing nearly fourfold between 2000 and 2006 .
The Russian government , which projected a 29 percent increase in spending for 2007 , plans to replace nearly half its arsenal with new weaponry by 2015 .
Compared to Russia , North Korea has had the full experience of economic collapse with very little subsequent recovery .
Yet , despite its woefully limited means , it has tried to keep up with the great powers that surround it .
By many estimates , Pyongyang devotes as much as a quarter of its budget to the military ( even though prosperous South Korea still spends as much , or more , on its military than the North ’s entire gross domestic product ) .
North Korea ’s failure to match the conventional military spending of South Korea , much less Japan or the United States , was what made the building of a “ nuclear deterrent ” increasingly attractive to its leaders .
In other words , the current nuclear crisis that sucks up so much diplomatic attention in Northeast Asia today is at least partly a result of the region ’s accelerating conventional arms race and North Korea ’s inability to keep pace .
Critics of the North Korean regime often point out that its military spending is ultimately a human rights violation , because the government essentially takes food out of the mouths of its people to spend on armaments .
North Korea is , however , just a particularly gross example of an expanding global problem .
Each of the six countries in the new Pacific arms race has devised a wealth of rationales for its military spending  and each has ignored significant domestic needs in the process .
Given the sums that would be necessary to address the decommissioning of nuclear weapons , the looming crisis of climate change , and the destabilizing gap between rich and poor , such spending priorities are in themselves a threat to humanity .
The world put 37 percent more into military spending in 2006 than in 1997 .
If the “ peace dividend ” that was to follow the end of the Cold War never quite appeared , a decade later the world finds itself burdened with quite the opposite : a genuine peace deficit .

SCI FI Channel is holding an " upfront " event in New York City today , and Battlestar Galactica had its own press conference to share some rather large news with fans .
As everyone knows , this is the series ' final season - and one that had its production delayed by the writers ' strike .
Well , now there 's a lot more to report .
So much , it takes a press conference to do it .
It has been confirmed that the long rumored and scantily reported spin - off , Caprica is in fact a go project .
SCI FI Channel has given the green light to a two - hour " backdoor " pilot for the series – which means it'll air as a TV movie ( not unlike the promotion and rollout for " Razor " ) – and if that 's successful it'll get a series commitment from the network .
The project is currently slated to shoot this spring and air in the fall .
Casting is underway now .
As was originally reported when the series was announced , the show takes place 50 years before the events of Battlestar Galactica .
Ron Moore is being vague on his day - to - day involvement with the new series , but Moore and BSG producer David Eick will serve as producers .
They also said the show will be more " sweeping drama , " and likened it to Dallas .
Not sure that 's the show we'd like to see crossed with Battlestar - but more BSG is more BSG .
We 'll have more updates so keep checking IGN TV for details .

At a busy microbiology lab in San Francisco , bad bugs are brewing inside vials of human blood , or sprouting inside petri dishes , all in preparation for a battery of tests .
These tests will tell doctors at UCSF Medical Center which kinds of bacteria are infecting their patients , and which antibiotics have the best chance to knock those infections down .
[ Podcast : Growing problem of drug - resistant diseases and what you can do about it . ]
With disturbing regularity , the list of available options is short , and it is getting shorter .
Dr. Jeff Brooks has been director of the UCSF lab for 29 years , and has watched with a mixture of fascination and dread how bacteria once tamed by antibiotics evolve rapidly into forms that practically no drug can treat .
" These organisms are very small , " he said , " but they are still smarter than we are . "
Among the most alarming of these is MRSA , or methicillin - resistant Staphylococcus aureus , a bug that used to be confined to vulnerable hospital patients , but now is infecting otherwise healthy people in schools , gymnasiums and the home .
As MRSA continues its natural evolution , even more drug - resistant strains are emerging .
The most aggressive of these is one called USA300 .
Last week , doctors at San Francisco General Hospital reported that a variant of that strain , resistant to six important antibiotics normally used to treat staph , may be transmitted by sexual contact and is spreading among gay men in San Francisco , Boston , New York and Los Angeles .
Yet the problem goes far beyond one bug and a handful of drugs .
Entire classes of mainstay antibiotics are being threatened with obsolescence , and bugs far more dangerous than staph are evolving in ominous ways .
" We are on the verge of losing control of the situation , particularly in the hospitals , " said Dr. Chip Chambers , chief of infectious disease at San Francisco General Hospital .
The reasons for increasing drug resistance are well known :
- Overuse of antibiotics , which speeds the natural evolution of bacteria , promoting new mutant strains resistant to those drugs .
- Careless prescribing of antibiotics that are n't effective for the malady in question , such as a viral infection .
- Patient demand for antibiotics when they are n't needed .
Heavy use of antibiotics in poultry and livestock feed , which can breed resistance to similar drugs for people .
Germ strains that interbreed at hospitals , where infection controls as simple as hand - washing are lax .
All this is happening while the supply of new antibiotics from drug company laboratories is running dry .
Since commercial production of penicillin began in the 1940s , antibiotics have been the miracle drugs of modern medicine , suppressing infectious diseases that have afflicted human beings for thousands of years .
But today , as a generation of Baby Boomers begins to enter a phase of life marked by the ailments of aging , we are running out of miracles .
Top infectious disease doctors are saying that lawmakers and the public at large do not realize the grave implications of this trend .
" Within just a few years , we could be seeing that most of our microorganisms are resistant to most of our antibiotics , " said Dr. Jack Edwards , chief of infectious diseases at Harbor - UCLA Medical Center .
At Brooks ' microbiology laboratory , the evolutionary struggle of bacteria versus antibiotics is on display every day .
He grabbed a clear plastic dish that grew golden - hued MRSA germs taken from a patient a few days earlier .
Inside were seven paper dots , each impregnated with a different drug .
If the antibiotic worked , the dot had a clear ring around it - a zone where no germs could grow .
No ring meant the drug had failed .
This test was typical .
Three drugs worked , four had failed .
The strategy for nearly 70 years has been to stay a step ahead of resistance by developing new antibiotics .
In the past decade , however , major drugmakers have been dropping out of the field .
The number of new antibiotics in development has plummeted .
During the five - year period ended in 1987 , the FDA licensed 16 novel antibiotics .
In the most recent five - year period , only five were approved .
For drugmakers , the economics are simple :
An antibiotic can cure an infection in a matter of days .
There is much more money in finding drugs that must be taken for a lifetime .
Toll of antibiotic resistance
With antibiotic research lagging , the bugs are catching up , and infections are taking a terrible toll .
The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that each year 99,000 Americans die of various bacterial infections that they pick up while hospitalized - more than double the number killed every year in automobile accidents .
Of the 1.7 million hospital - acquired infections that occur each year , studies show , 70 percent are resistant to at least one antibiotic .
Drug - resistant staph is rapidly becoming a major public health menace .
Last fall , the CDC estimated that MRSA alone has killed 19,000 Americans .
Most of these patients picked up the bug in the hospital , but it is now spreading in urban and suburban neighborhoods across the nation .
" MRSA is killing people .
It almost killed me , " said Peg McQueary , whose life was upended when she nicked her leg with a razor three years ago .
Within days , her leg was grotesquely swollen , red from foot to knee .
Her husband wheeled her into a Kaiser medical office , where her doctor took one look and rushed her to an isolation room .
She was placed on intravenous vancomycin , a drug reserved for the most serious cases of MRSA .
Since that frightening week , the 42 - year - old Roseville woman has spent much of her life in and out of hospitals , and she 's learned just how difficult these infections can be to treat .
McQueary has burned through drug after drug , but the staph keeps coming back .
She 's been hooked up at her home to bags of vancomycin and swallowed doses of linezolid , clindamycin and a half a dozen other antibiotics with barely pronounceable names and limited effect .
One of the newest antibiotics , intravenous daptomycin - approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2003 - seems to work the best , but it has not prevented recurrences .
" It 's just a struggle to do everyday things , " she said .
" I am ready to scream about it . "
Today , she moderates a Web site , MRSA Resources Support Forum , swapping stories with other sufferers .
" Giving them a place to vent is some sort of healing for me , " she said .
McQueary 's travails are becoming an all - too - familiar American experience .
As bacteria evolve new ways to sidestep antibiotics , doctors treating infections find themselves with a dwindling list of options .
Old - line drugs are losing their punch , while the newer ones are both costly and laden with side effects .
Drugs ' weakening grip
Dr. Joseph Guglielmo , chairman of the Department of Clinical Pharmacy at UCSF , closely tracks the effectiveness of dozens of antibiotics against different infectious bacteria .
Laminated color - coded cards called antibiograms are printed up for hospital physicians each year .
They chart the success rate of each antibiotic against at least 12 major pathogens .
These charts show how antibiotics , like tires slowly leaking air , are losing strength year by year .
As head of the hospital pharmacy , Guglielmo oversees a small warehouse at the medical center that stores millions of dollars worth of prescription drugs that are used every day to treat patients there .
Strolling down the aisles that houses bins of antibiotics , he reached for a bottle of imipenem , and cradled the little vial in the palm of his hand .
" This one is the last line of defense , " he said .
Imipenem was approved by the FDA in 1985 .
A powerful member of the carbapenem family - the latest in a long line of penicillin - like drugs - it is frequently used in hospitals today because it can still defeat a wide variety of germs that have outwitted the earlier - generation antibiotics .
But at a cost of about $ 60 a day , and with a safety profile that includes risk of seizure , it is a " Big Gun " drug that must be used carefully .
As soon as doctors discover that a lesser antibiotic will work , they will stop prescribing imipenem , like soldiers conserving their last remaining stores of ammunition .
Now , there are signs of trouble .
Imipenem has been the antibiotic of choice for doctors treating Klebsiella , a vigorous microbe that causes pneumonia in hospitalized patients .
But in June 2005 , New York City doctors reported in the journal Archives of Internal Medicine outbreaks of imipenem - resistant Klebsiella .
Fifty - nine such cases were logged at just two hospitals .
The death rate among those whose infections entered their bloodstreams was 47 percent .
Last year , Israeli doctors battled an outbreak of carbapenem - resistant Klebsiella that has killed more than 400 patients .
Cipro's dramatic decline
The antibiotic Cipro , approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1987 , is familiar to millions of Americans because it is widely prescribed for pneumonia , urinary tract infections and sexually transmitted diseases .
It was the drug used to treat victims of the anthrax mailings that followed the Sept. 11 attacks .
Unlike most antibiotics , which originated from natural toxins produced by bacteria , Cipro came from tinkering with a chemical compound used to fight malaria .
The German drug giant Bayer patented Cipro 's active ingredient in 1983 , and it subsequently became the most widely sold antibiotic in the world .
At hospitals across the country , however , clinicians have witnessed a remarkable drop - off in the utility of Cipro against more commonly encountered germs .
Antibiograms from the UCSF lab highlight the alarming erosion :
As recently as 1999 , Cipro was effective against 95 percent of specimens of E. coli - bacteria responsible for the most common hospital - acquired infections in the United States .
By 2006 , Cipro would work against only 60 percent of samples tested .
The bacterial evolution that has so quickly sapped Cipro has also reduced the effectiveness of the entire family of related antibiotics called fluoroquinolones - drugs such as Levaquin , Floxin , and Noroxin .
" If there is ever a group of drugs that has taken a beating , it is these , " said UCSF pharmacy chief Guglielmo .
Against Acinetobacter - a bug responsible for rising numbers of bloodstream and lung infections in intensive care units , as well as among combat casualties in Iraq - Cipro 's effectiveness fell from 80 percent in 1999 to 10 percent just four years later .
Cipro has also lost ground against Pseudomonas aeruginosa , a common cause of pneumonia in hospitalized patients .
Nearly 80 percent of the bugs tested were susceptible to Cipro in 1999 .
That fell to 65 percent by 2004 .
At UCSF , doctors carefully monitor the trends in drug resistance and modify their prescribing patterns accordingly .
As a result , they have been able to nudge some of these resistance levels down .
Cipro's effectiveness against Acinetobacter crept up to 40 percent last year , for example , but the overall trend remains alarming .
Although MRSA infections have been capturing headlines , bugs such as Acinetobacter , Klebsiella and Pseudomonas are keeping doctors awake at night .
They come from a class of pathogens called Gram - negative bacteria , which typically have an extra layer of microbial skin to ward off antibiotics , and internal pumps that literally drive out antibiotics that penetrate .
Gram - negative infections have always been difficult to treat , and few new drugs are in development .
Some researchers believe that the pipeline for new antibiotics is drying up because it is simply getting more difficult to outwit the bugs .
" It may be that we 've already found all the good antibiotics , " warned Chambers , San Francisco General Hospital 's infectious disease chief .
" If that is so , then we 've really got to be careful how we use the ones we have . "
Bacteria 's natural evolution
Terry Hazen , senior scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and director of its ecology program , is not at all surprised by the tenacity of our bacterial foes .
" We are talking about 3.5 billion years of evolution , " he said .
" They are the dominant life on Earth . "
Bacteria have invaded virtually every ecological niche on the planet .
Human explorers of extreme environments such as deep wells and mines are still finding new bacterial species .
" As you go deeper into the subsurface , thousands and thousands of feet , you find bacteria that have been isolated for millions of years - and you find multiple antibiotic resistance , " Hazen said .
In his view , when bacteria develop resistance to modern antibiotics , they are merely rolling out old tricks they mastered eons ago in their struggle to live in harsh environments in competition with similarly resilient species .
Drug industry economics are also a factor .
" It takes a hell of a lot of effort to find the next really good drug , " said Steven Projan , vice president of New Jersey pharmaceutical giant Wyeth Inc .
The costs of bringing a new drug to market are hotly debated .
A Tufts University study estimated $ 802 million ; the consumer group Public Citizen pegs it at $ 110 million .
Either way , the investment is huge .
By 1990 , according to the Infectious Diseases Society of America , half the major drugmakers in Japan and the United States had cut back or halted antibiotic research .
Since 2000 , some of the biggest names in pharmaceutical development - Roche , Bristol - Myers Squibb , Abbott Laboratories , Eli Lilly , Aventis and Procter & Gamble - had joined the exodus .
By common measures used to gauge the profit potential of new drugs , antibiotics fall way behind , Projan explained .
For every $ 100 million that a new antibiotic might yield , after projected revenue and expenses are tallied , a new cancer drug will generate $ 300 million .
A new drug for arthritis , by this same analysis , brings in $ 1.1 billion .
Investors have been placing their bets accordingly .
In 2002 , Wyeth had sharply curtailed its own antibiotic drug discovery programs .
" We tried to get out of the field , but one of the reasons we did not get out altogether is we feel we have a public responsibility to fund more research , " said Projan .
Wyeth 's decision to keep some antibiotic research alive eventually paid off .
In June 2005 , the FDA licensed Tygacil , an intravenous antibiotic for complicated skin diseases such as drug - resistant staph infection .
Only one new antibiotic for oral or intravenous use has won FDA approval since .
Pointing a finger at doctors
The waning of antibiotics in the arsenal of modern medicine has been going on for so long that some doctors fear a kind of complacency has set in .
Increasingly , the medical profession is pointing a finger at itself .
" We have behaved very badly , " said Dr. Louis Rice , a Harvard - educated , Columbia - trained specialist in infectious diseases .
" We have made a lot of stupid choices . "
His words brought a nervous silence to thousands of his colleagues , as he delivered a keynote speech in 2006 for the American Society for Microbiology 's annual conference in San Francisco .
Rice , a professor at Cleveland 's Case Western Reserve University , said doctors and drug companies alike are responsible for breeding resistance by " the indiscriminate dumping of antibiotics into our human patients . "
Drug -resistant germs contaminate the bedrails , the catheter lines , the blood pressure cuffs and even the unwashed hands of doctors , nurses and orderlies .
The germs keep evolving , swapping drug - resistance traits with other microbes .
He likened American intensive - care units - the high - tech enclaves where the most seriously ill patients are treated - to " toxic waste dumps . "
Drug companies , he said , have a responsibility to refill the nation 's depleted medicine chest .
He suggested that a tax - similar to a Superfund tax placed on polluters to clean up toxic waste sites - be imposed on companies that have dropped antibiotic research .
It would support drugmakers that are still in the game .
" Your products that you 've made billions and billions and billions and billions of dollars on have created this problem , and you can't just walk away , " he said .
Rice has stressed that the existing arsenal of antibiotics should be used wisely , and that often means sparingly .
During a half century of antibiotic use , he said , there is scant research on how short a course of drugs is actually needed to cure a patient .
Instead , doctors routinely prescribe a week to 10 - day course of drugs recommended by manufacturers .
If patients are taking antibiotics after their infections are truly gone , they are creating conditions that breed resistance .
Indeed , a Dutch study showed that one kind of pneumonia can be treated just as successfully with three days of amoxicillin as with the traditional eight .
Since drug companies cannot be expected to spend money on research that could trim sales of their products , federally funded agencies such as the National Institutes of Health should do the job , Rice said in a recent interview .
He also took his own specialty to task for failing to protect the most important weapons its arsenal .
Infectious disease experts at hospitals must find the " backbone " to stop other doctors from prescribing antibiotics unnecessarily , Rice said .
He argued they should assert their authority to control antibiotic usage , just as cancer specialists have a say in which chemotherapy drugs are prescribed by surgeons .
And all health care professionals , he added , " have to wash their damn hands . "

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The U.S. military mistakenly shipped four fuses for nuclear missiles to Taiwan in 2006 and never caught the error , the Pentagon said on Tuesday , acknowledging an incident likely to rile China .
The military was supposed to ship helicopter batteries to Taiwan , but instead sent fuses used as part of the trigger mechanism on Minuteman missiles .
Taiwan returned the parts to U.S. custody last week .
No nuclear material was shipped to Taiwan , Pentagon officials said .
The problem went unnoticed until Taiwan realized it did not have the helicopter batteries it ordered and reported the issue to the United States , U.S. officials said .
The United States has notified China , which claims the self - ruled island as its own , and is modernizing its military to close the technology gap with Taiwan ’s mainly U.S. weapons .
The two sides have been run separately since 1949 , and Beijing has never renounced the use of force to bring the island under its control .
“ The secretary of defense is taking this very seriously .
We are all taking this very seriously , ” Air Force Secretary Michael Wynne said .
“ Though this was not and could not be construed as nuclear material ...
I would tell you that we are very concerned about it , ” he told reporters at the Pentagon .
The erroneous fuse shipment was the Pentagon ’s second embarrassing misplacement of nuclear or nuclear - related equipment announced in recent months .
An Air Force bomber mistakenly carried nuclear warheads over the United States in August 2007 .

INVENTORY
The Defense Department has ordered the Navy and Air Force to take inventory of all nuclear and nuclear - associated equipment and material and U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates has ordered an investigation into the fuse incident , said Ryan Henry , principle deputy undersecretary of defense for policy .
Gates wants initial results from the investigation by April 15 and a full report within 60 days .
The United States may have violated international law or international arms agreements with the shipment .
“ That ’s under analysis now , ” Henry said .
“ If there was something that was amiss , it clearly was not intentional . ”
What led to the fuse shipment is still unclear , Henry and Wynne said .
The Pentagon also does not yet know who was responsible .
The fuses , which send an electronic signal to the device that starts the nuclear weapon ’s trigger process , are among a class of sensitive equipment that must be accounted for on a quarterly basis .
Based on the information now known , the four fuses , which do not resemble helicopter batteries , were wrongly placed in an unclassified storage area .
They were then shipped in late 2006 to Taiwan , which placed them in storage .
When Taiwan realized it had received the incorrect shipment , it notified the U.S. military .
Wynne would not say when Taiwan first reported the problem .
But U.S. military officials did not understand the nature of the problem until last week .
“ We on our side thought we were talking about different sorts of batteries .
There was an effort to resolve and reimburse them .
It was n’t until this past week that we became aware that they had something akin to a nose - cone assembly , ” Henry said .
Gates and President George W. Bush were told on Friday , the day the fuses were returned to U.S. custody , officials said .
White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said Bush still had confidence in Air Force leadership .
Henry said there was no indication Taiwan tampered with the fuses before returning them .
Many Israelis and their supporters reject the term , with its implication of racist animus .
“ The basis of separation is not ethnic since Israeli Arabs and Jerusalem residents with Israeli ID cards can use the road , ” argues Dore Gold , president of the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs , a conservative research organization .
“ The basis of the separation is to keep out of secure areas people living in chaotic areas .
If the Palestinian Authority , which has thousands of men under arms , had fought terror , this would n’t have been necessary . ”
The court ’s latest decision is significant because it accepted the idea in principle put forth by the army  that while it had no choice but to ban Palestinian traffic from the road because of anti-Israel attacks on it , some of which it says originated from the surrounding villages , it would build separate roads for the Palestinians .
The court has never ruled on the legality of separate roads , despite a growing network of them around the West Bank .
If this interim decision reflects its view that such a system is legally acceptable , that represents a big new step .
A court spokeswoman said the justices would not comment .
David Kretzmer , an emeritus professor of international law at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem , wrote in an op - ed article in the Israeli newspaper Haaretz of what he called the “ judicial hypocrisy ” of Israel ’s reign over the territories manifest in this case .

He said that while the changed security circumstances of recent years may have forced a change in the road ’s mixed use , “ the unavoidable conclusion is that , as unfortunate as this may be , Israelis should not be allowed to travel on the road that was built , let ’s not forget , for the benefit of the local population .
“ But the military government has , of course , decided otherwise : Israelis will be allowed to travel on the road , while Palestinians  for whom , the court ’s ruling says , the road was paved  cannot use it , and access to the road from local Palestinian villages will be blocked . ”

We are pleased to present an excerpt from Chapter 13 of Luke Wroblewski ’s Web Form Design : Filling in the Blanks ( Rosenfeld Media , 2008 ) .
when you order from the publisher ’s site
I ’ll just come out and say this : sign - up forms must die .
In the introduction to this book I described the process of stumbling upon or being recommended to a web service .
You arrive eager to dive in and start engaging and what ’s the first thing that greets you ?
A form .
Article Continues Below
We can do better .
In fact , I believe we can get people engaged with digital services in a way that tells them how such services work and why they should care enough to use them .
I also believe we can do this without explicitly making them fill out a sign - up form as a first step .
But before we get into the potential of gradual engagement ( your path out of sign - in “ dullery ” ) , let ’s look at how the process of engaging with an online service typically works .
Since 2007 was a breakout year for online video , it ’s safe to assume a lot of people went on the web to post one of their videos .
Perhaps they heard Google Video was a good place to do so .
Upon arriving at the site , they found a link to share their video and what happened next ?
They got the form in Figure 13.1 .
Figure 13.1
A sign - up form greets new customers at Google Video .
You are required to give us your email address , select a password , tell us your name , your location , verify this strange word , agree to our terms of service , and finally , you will get what ’s behind the form .
Now contrast this approach with that of another online video service : Jumpcut .
The primary calls to action on the Jumpcut front page , as seen in Figure 13.2 , are Make a Movie and Try a Demo .
Right out the gate , Jumpcut is interested in telling you how their service works and why it ’s great for you .
So let ’s dive in .
Selecting Make a Movie brings up a single input field for the title of your movie and a few options you can use to upload media files for your movie .
Selecting Upload from this list allows you to add images , audio , and video from your desktop computer .
Once you do , you are put in Jumpcut ’s web - based video editor .
Here you can edit your movie , add styles , coordinate your audio , video , images , and more .
Figure 13.2
The process of adding a video to Jumpcut introduces you to the services the site provides , namely online video editing .
So far , no form .
It ’s only when you want to publish or share your movie that Jumpcut asks for your name and email so you and others can access the movie you just made .
Through this process , you learned what Jumpcut does , and you did it without having to jump through a sign - up form .
That ’s gradual engagement .
Let ’s look at another example .
Geni is a web service that allows anyone to set up a family tree and share it with family and friends .
What ’s the first thing potential customers need to do when they arrive at Geni ?
Fill out a registration form ?
Nope , they make a family tree .
After all , that ’s what ’s Geni is for .
The front page of Geni ( Figure 13.3 ) makes it clear what the site is for .
So get started creating a family tree by entering your name and email address .
Next , you can add your parents , their siblings , or your siblings , and in no time , you have a pretty good family tree going .
While you were at it , Geni sent you an email with your user name and password so you can get back to your family tree anytime you want .
Figure 13.3
Geni ’s process of creating a family tree contains no explicit registration forms and gets people acquainted with Geni ’s service right away .
Once again through the process of gradual engagement , you learned what a web service does , and you did it without an explicit registration form requiring you to fork over a lot of information .
In Geni ’s case , their approach to gradual engagement has given them five million profiles in five months .
Not too shabby .
It ’s worth noting that any web service that automatically sets up an account for its customers may leave some people confused about whether they actually have an account or not .
After all , they did not explicitly create one .
As a result , these services need to ensure they have an easy way for people to access their account information if they did not see or chose to ignore the email they were sent outlining their account information .
Another example of gradual engagement comes from TripIt : a web service that allows people to assemble a trip itinerary , complete with weather and driving directions , using only their flight , hotel , and rental car confirmation emails .
The first step to getting started is emailing TripIt a confirmation email from upcoming or past travel .
TripIt will send you back a note that provides access to an automatically created personal travel itinerary ( see Figure 13.4 ) .
Figure 13.4
Using TripIt starts by forwarding a travel confirmation email — not with a sign - up form .
Once again , your first step in using TripIt is not a sign - up form .
Instead , you learn how the service works by actually using it .
TripIt gets your name and email address from the confirmation emails you send the service .
From there , if you want to edit your name , email , or create a password to access the site , you can do so .
Chances are you will do so now that you know how the service works and how it benefits you .
When exploring if gradual engagement might be right for your web service , it ’s important to consider how a series of interactions can explain how potential customers can use your service and why they should care .
Gradual engagement is n’t well served by simply distributing each of your sign - up form input fields onto separate web pages .
While I applaud Fidelity ’s myplan form ( Figure 13.5 ) for its attempt at making financial planning more enjoyable , I ’m not sure distributing each of their input fields to separate web pages and presenting them as slider inputs is the best way to achieve their goal of getting people to understand what Fidelity can do for them .
Figure 13.5 : Fidelity ’s myplan form divides a series of input into stand - alone slider interactions .
Best Practices#section2
When planning a customer ’s initial experience for your web service , think about how you can avoid sign - up forms in favor of gradual engagement .
If you do opt for a gradual engagement solution , ensure that it gives potential customers an understanding of how they can use your service and why they should care .
If you choose to auto - generate accounts for potential customers , ensure there is a clear way for them to access their account .
Chances are that people will either ignore or not see account creation emails , and may be uncertain if they have an account or not .
Avoid gradual engagement solutions that simply distribute the various input fields in a sign - up form across multiple pages .
It ’s a good possibility that this will reduce efficiency and not delight anyone .
One group of people naively believe that , in the absence of guns , criminal violence would be much reduced .
They are quite wrong about that prediction : to the contrary , the strong would be able to bully the weak and we would be back in the Dark Ages ... or the modern Third World .
Further , thinking that a mature technology such as firearms manufacture can be legislated out of existence is an opium pipe dream .
Guns , in their basic form , are not very complex .
Anyone with basic tools can make them and ammunition for them .
Moreover , roughly 500 million functional firearms already exist .
Guns , propely maintained , last for centuries .
Hi-res Imagine a pack of hyenas stalking a human .
As they close in for the kill , their intended prey repulses them with a rifle .
As the surviving predators retreat , they think : " If only we could separate that human from her gun ! "
People who think as those hyenas are less naive than the idealists who wish to ban guns outright .
" Gun control " is a misnomer for what they have in mind .
They are evil : they wish to control others .
One of the easiest way to control other people is by making them defenseless .
Communists , fascists and other totalitarians world over have rendered their subject defenseless as the first step towards total control .
Then they could imprison or murder millions with complete impunity .
Who wishes others to be defenseless ?
Rapists and muggers prefer unarmed victims .
Politicians and mafia chiefs who want people to depend on them for protection .
Racists who wish to exterminate other peoples : genocide is much easier to perpetrate when the victims are unarmed .
In sum , those who wish to have a monopoly on arms are never well - meaning people .
They might not admit it , but their narcotic of choice is power over others .
Hi-res Hi-res Disarming others is never done for their benefit .
Usually , rendering people defenseless is a prelude to abusing them further .
Was disarmament of the European Jews started in 1938 done for their benefit .
Did it " reduce gun violence in their community " or did it merely make them easier to murder ?
Hi-res Hi-res Did any people armed with rifles end up stuffed into the holds of slave ships ?
When we look at history , a pattern emerges : free people have guns , slaves do n't .
Just having guns does not guarantee freedom , just as having air to breathe does not guarantee survival .
Plenty of armed people are dependent on others for food , decision - making and the like .
Being armed is just one of several essential elements necessary for freedom .
Being unarmed by choice or compulsion guarantees having to exist at the mercy of others .
Hi-res
Hi-res The Klan had much to do with the early gun control laws in America .
Many of the current gun control laws stemmed from the fear of armed and independent minorities .
After all , even a few determined ( and armed ) people can stop a Klan raid or make committing massacres like the 1923 Rosewood events too risky for the perpetrators .
Hi-res Rioting mobs have always picked the path of least resistence .
Taking steps not to look like easy prey could well be enough to avoid actual bloodshed .
With that in mind , is it not ironic that many organizations pretending to fight for the civil rights of their people support keeping their members disarmed and defenseless ?
Hi-res Hi-res Similarly , NAACP is fond of portraying their own members as too irresponsible to own guns .
Many organizations aggressively advocate disarmament of their own members , apparently hoping that the feeling of vulnerability would cause people to rely on their self - proclaimed " community leaders " for security .
Hi-res
The periodic attempts to render Americans defenseless continue in the form of gun buy - ups conducted in the minority and poor neighnorhoods .
Not only do the residents have to depend on a patently inadequate police protection but they are also coaxed into giving up their means of effective self - defense .
For some reason , we do not see Hollywood celebrities or US Congressmen rushing to give up their guns in exchange for a fast food certificate or a pair of sneakers .
Just as racists pre-judge others based on appearances , gun-phobic people pre-judge inanimate objects .
When you hear the phrase " keep guns out of the wrong hands " , who do you think they mean to disarm ?
Hi-res Hi-res Gay - bashing has become a hazardous undertaking lately : Pink Pistols chapters have opened nation - wide .
Originally formed for training GLBT folks in self - defense skills , they have expanded to included many hetero members .
Traditionally , homosexuals have been perceived as weak , easily intimidated , in short , as ideal targets .
The realization that attempted gay - bashing would likely be stopped at gunpoint ought to keep bigots from even trying .
Hi-res Hi-res Chauvinist pigs who think that " slapping the bitch around " is good fun might re-think that idea .
The prospect of facing an armed victim strikes fear into the tiny brains of hostile bigots .
That 's how it should be .
No lawful person would wish to fire on another human .
However , most people would wish to have a choice between being molested and fighting back .
Should they choose to resist , who would begrudge them effective tools for the purpose ?
Hi-res Hi-res
Gun control is never about improving safety for those disarmed by it .
It has only two purposes .
The first is rendering people helpless for extermination or enslavement .
The second purpose , more common among the US perpetrators of the practice , is to deny self - sufficiency to the victims of gun control .
The same technique is used by the mafia in countries where civilian ownership of arms is rare : people must pay for protection , by voting for their " protectors " or by behaving meekly .
Hi-res
The disarming of Americans is being pushed by the means of laws prohibiting ownership or use of effective means of self - protection .
Laws on Federal and local levels prohibit ownership of personal defense weapons ( PDW ) , severely restrict ownership of older types and often prohibit carry of sidearms outright .
Violent criminals are direct beneficiaries of gun control .
When the law - abiding are disarmed , they can rob , rape and murder without worrying that an intended victim would retire them from the business of crime .
Lee Gomes of the Wall Street Journal writes that recent research shows that a brain rewards itself with a squirt of natural opiates when it comes across new information that requires interpretation .
That 's why , he concludes , people stay on the Web for long periods of time .
What is it about a Web site that might make it literally irresistible ?
Clues are offered by research conducted by Irving Biederman , a neuroscientist at the University of Southern California , who is interested in the evolutionary and biological basis of the human need for information .
Dr. Biederman first showed a collection of photographs to volunteer test subjects , and found they said they preferred certain kinds of pictures ( monkeys in a tree or a group of houses along a river ) over others ( an empty parking lot or a pile of old paint cans ) .
The preferred pictures had certain common features , including a good vantage on a landscape and an element of mystery .
In one way or another , said Dr. Biederman , they all presented new information that somehow needed to be interpreted .
When he hooked up volunteers to a brain - scanning machine , the preferred pictures were shown to generate much more brain activity than the unpreferred shots .
While researchers do n't yet know what exactly these brain scans signify , a likely possibility involves increased production of the brain 's pleasure - enhancing neurotransmitters called opioids .

JOHNSTOWN , Pennsylvania ( Reuters ) Democratic presidential hopeful Barack Obama on Saturday said Hillary Clinton can stay in the nominating race as long as she wants and expressed confidence that Democrats will coalesce around the winner despite the often bitter contest .

“ My attitude is that Senator Clinton can run as long as she wants .
Her name is on the ballot and she is a fierce and formidable competitor , ” said Obama , adding that the notion that Democrats have been split by the prolonged nominating contest “ is somewhat overstated . ”
Clinton , a New York senator , on Friday vowed to stay in the White House race , rejecting mounting pressure from some Democratic leaders to bow out and let the party focus on defeating the presumptive Republican nominee , Arizona Sen .
John McCain , in the November general election .
Clinton trails Obama in the race for 2,024 Democratic nominating delegates .
But she says she can still beat the Illinois senator and that all Democrats should get a chance to vote .
At rallies on Saturday in Indiana and Kentucky , crowds objected loudly when Clinton mentioned calls for the Democratic primary contest to conclude .
“ There are some folks saying , ‘ well , we ought to stop these elections , ’ ” she told a rally in Indianapolis .
“ I did n’t think we believed that in America .
I thought we of all people knew how important it was to give everyone a chance to have their voices heard and their votes counted , ” Clinton said .
OLIVE BRANCH
The former first lady who would be the first woman U.S. president also repeated her call to find a way to count votes from Michigan and Florida , which broke party rules by moving up the dates of their contests , disqualifying the results .
Holding out an olive branch to her supporters , Obama said Clinton “ obviously believes that she would make the best nominee and the best president and I think that she should be able to compete and her supporters should be able to support her for as long as they are willing or able . ”
Obama , who would be the first black U.S. president , was on a six - day bus tour through Pennsylvania where Clinton is running well ahead in polls in advance of the April 22 primary .
Obama said the Democratic Party will need to move quickly and decisively to pick its nominee in early June when the state - by - state nominating contests are winding down , and turn its attention to taking on Republicans .
“ I think it is important to pivot as quickly as possible for the superdelegates or others to make a decision as quickly as possible , ” Obama said , to give the nominee time to choose a running mate and plan for the party ’s convention in August .

Obama and Clinton are avidly courting them to try to lock down the nomination .
100 YEARS IN IRAQ
Obama also downplayed fears that the contest will continue to divide Democrats in the election against McCain .
“ You ca n’t tell me that some of my supporters are going to say ‘ well , we ’d rather have the guy who may want to stay in Iraq for 100 years because we are mad that Senator Clinton ran a negative ad about Senator Obama .
And I think the converse is true as well , ” he said .
Obama and Clinton back pulling U.S. combat troops out of Iraq .
McCain has argued they could be needed there for years .
To avoid risking a divided party ahead of the November election , Obama said both campaigns should avoid excessive tactics .
“ I do want to make sure that ... we show some restraint and that we are measured in how we present the contrasts between myself and Senator Clinton , ” he said .
“ And we ’ve been very careful throughout this campaign not to say things that could be used as ammunition for the Republicans if Senator Clinton was the nominee . ”
It seemed like a good idea at the time .
What New York clearly needed was a Society of Independent Artists .
It would hold an annual exhibition , to which any painter or sculptor could submit work , and somehow it would be displayed .
There would n't be any jury or judges ; the artist would simply have to pay a fee of $ 6 , and their work would be displayed in the exhibition hall of the society .
Except , that is , for one unforeseen development .
One day in spring 1917 , the organisers of the forthcoming exhibition stood and gazed in consternation at one of the submissions .
The sculpture – is that what it was ?
– was accompanied by a letter from one Mr Richard Mutt , who enclosed his six dollars .
The object bore the signature of the artist – R Mutt – and it had a title , Fountain .
But the " artist " obviously had n't sculpted the object himself .
It was an industrially produced object .
Not a fountain , but , well , a urinal .
In fact , it was a urinal of the most common variety , in white porcelain , lying on its back .
You can see it , from tomorrow , at Tate Modern 's exhibition Duchamp , Man Ray , Picabia – and it's fair to say that the response to it in 1917 in New York may well be replicated by some visitors , in 2008 , in London .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Ninety - one years ago some discussion took place and , by a small majority , it was decided that the object should be returned to Mr Mutt with the comment that whatever incarnation his object was , it had no darn place in an exhibition of art .
In a very short period , it then emerged that there was no Richard Mutt .
The man behind the bizarre and incredible submission proved to be one of the directors of the society itself , an amusing and audacious French artist , recently arrived in America , called Marcel Duchamp .
He resigned from the society ; and art was never the same again .
Were they complete fools to turn down a great classic of modern art ?
In fairness , the directors could never ( in 1917 ) have been asked to pass judgement on anything that remotely resembled Fountain .
While almost every artist since the beginning of time has adapted , refined and developed art as it was handed down to him , it is not given to very many artists , without resource to the changing means of technology , to invent an entirely new art .
In fact , it might be that , in the long centuries since the invention of easel painting , only Duchamp has carried out the sort of revolution represented by that urinal .
Such is the importance of Fountain that , in December 2004 , it was voted the most influential work of modern art by 500 art - world professionals .
In contemplation , that seems something of an understatement : with this single " readymade " work , Duchamp invented conceptual art and severed for ever the traditional link between the artist 's labour and the merit of the work .
It could n't have happened anywhere but America .
Duchamp , at the height of the furore , declared that " the only works of art America has given are her plumbing and her bridges " .
America , too , was the land of the huckster and the charlatan – one of the meanings of Duchamp 's pseudonym refers to the gambler Mutt in Bud Fisher 's famous Mutt and Jeff cartoon strip .
It would be wrong to neglect the element of the huge practical joke in Fountain and its general air of disconcertingly ridiculing the art world as well as , with complete seriousness , reconfiguring everything it thought it believed about art .
The objections to Fountain began immediately , and have never gone away .
Duchamp , in a brief response in the avant - garde journal The Blind Man in 1917 , summarised them : " Some contended it was immoral , vulgar .
Others , it was plagiarism , a plain piece of plumbing . "
These objections seek to pin down the object and its meanings to the purely functional .
There can be no meaning beyond that , and no artistic merit .
But it 's quite extraordinary how , once the urinal is removed from its customary setting , laid on its back like a turtle and given a signature , its meanings immediately multiply .
For some reason , it has n't been much remarked on that the object must have been an unfamiliar and exotic sight for half the audience .
Although Duchamp defends it against indecency by saying that it is a common sight in plumbers ' show windows , it would only be really familiar to his male audience .
Public lavatories were , indeed , a very recent development in the modern world , and there was little provision for women at all .
It will be remembered that the " furmity woman " in Hardy 's The Mayor of Casterbridge ( 1886 ) is arrested for " committing a public nuisance " in a large market town .
There were , simply , no private alternatives .
So what did women do ?
We have the witness of the English sexologist Havelock Ellis that in the 19th - century fashions of crinolines , ladies simply paused , ideally over a gravel path , and micturated while gazing into the middle distance .
The display of a urinal , then , was not commonplace at all , but extraordinarily modern , and one designed to be highly exotic and unfamiliar to half the audience .
Duchamp had started thinking of the idea of the " readymade " a year or two earlier .
His first was a mounted bicycle - wheel on a stool , which he said he simply liked looking at .
But many of the others contain some element of the exotic alongside their commonplace , manufactured element .
A snow shovel enchanted Duchamp , who had never seen such a thing until he came to America from France .
A bottle - dryer , conversely , must have been an unfamiliar and peculiar sight for his American circle .
Fountain divides its audience immediately along the lines of sex , who will in turn find it banal and familiar , or exotic and forbidden .
Sexual attraction and sexual difference was one of the most enduring obsessions of Duchamp , and often the peculiar conventions of the erotic furnish him with his most dazzling inventions .
His early painting Nude Descending a Staircase gets all its outrageous fun from the convention that a nude is decent and respectably aesthetic if seated or standing .
What nudes can't do without vulgarity is walk down a staircase .
They would pretty soon be walking from the landing to the hallway , from the drawing room to the kitchen ; and there is nothing more convincingly obscene than a cold burst of the everyday , as the " readymades " extensively show .
The work known as The Large Glass , or The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors , Even , made between 1915 and 1923 , similarly divides according to sexual difference .
The bride , in the upper panel , is all fluidity and biomorphous shapes .
The bachelors inhabit a world of arid , mechanical self - gratification , including sexual imagery drawn from an earlier Duchamp painting of a chocolate grinder .
And his last great work , Etant Donnés , an extraordinary peep - show tableau in Philadelphia , throws the viewer back on his own voyeurism in a mysterious display of withdrawn pornographic femininity .
Duchamp liked to move fluidly from one sex 's viewpoint to another , creating some of his best work in the persona of Rrose Sélavy ( there is a hilarious photograph of Duchamp in Rrose drag by Man Ray ) .
But he never confused them with each other .
Fountain , in a way , condenses all those sexual meanings with great concision .
It is a masculine property , but clearly one which has the feminine properties of receiving a man 's fluids .
That does n't sound much like a fountain , however ; and one rather comes to the conclusion that the source of the fountain 's jets , the bouche as it is called in French , are the parts of a speculative masculine observer .
Just as the aesthetics are solidly based in , and rather rely on , the viewer 's reactions , so its meaning depends on his reconstructing the object 's use in his head .
Anyone who thought it obscene would have to supply quite a train of thought to the object 's faux - innocence .
Not everyone has been satisfied to think only of the object 's use .
In recent years , one " artist " has succeeded in urinating into Fountain , and more have claimed to have done so .
Some of Duchamp 's works positively invite ad hoc collaboration with the eager , playful observer , such as the toybox versions of his greatest hits made to fit in a single suitcase .
One early admirer picked up the curiously heavy cage filled with marble sugar - cubes entitled Why Not Sneeze Rrose Sélavy and was told by a bored guard : " Do n't you know , you ai n't supposed to touch that crap ? "
But the great Fountain does n't invite intervention .
We are just supposed to look at it and marvel .
It is , oddly enough , an extraordinarily beautiful object .
Its lovely curves have the warmly shifting shape of many of Duchamp 's renderings of femininity .
In a famous photograph of 1917 by Alfred Stieglitz , Fountain has reminded many people of a grossly oversimplified erect penis and testicles .
In other representations , under bright light and with its shadows clearly outlined , it has been likened to the shape of a modest woman with head covered .
It is difficult to understand why those Americans who delight in discovering likenesses of the Virgin Mary in the most unlikely objects have never turned their attention to Duchamp 's Fountain .
In many photographs , that is exactly what it looks like , and I guess Duchamp turns it on its back to exacerbate this iconic , blasphemous resemblance .
Fountain , as full of meaning as an egg is full of meat , changed art for ever .
It had always been clear to thoughtful observers that the link between an artist 's skill and the merit of his work was a false one .
Some of the greatest painters in the world , such as Watteau or Goya , possess a limited technique , and many of the most brilliantly virtuosic and intricate produce art of no ultimate value .
There has never been any value in the proposal that the harder an artist works , or the more skilfully detailed his craft , the better the work of art in the end .
The link between labour and product was not decisively broken until Duchamp , however .
Perhaps the larger context helps us to understand why this happened in 1917 , and not before .
Tristan Tzara , the founder of Dada and a thinker in tune with Duchamp , said in his 1918 " Dada Manifesto " that " a work of art should not be beautiful in itself , for beauty is dead .
A work of art is never beautiful by decree , objectively and for all .
After the carnage we still retain the hope of a purified mankind . "
Duchamp came from a small town near Rouen , very close to the battlefields of the Great War .
The war was a massive discrediting of the powers of authority , and what men like Tzara and Duchamp were doing was dismantling the shaman - like powers of the virtuoso artist , the powers of judgement of critics and the juries that turned out to rule even the New York Society of Independent Artists .
As the century went on , the power and enchantment of the " readymade " , in the hands of men like Joseph Beuys , would turn out to be precisely its democratic , unambitious scale .
Many German artists , after the Second World War in particular , were uncomfortable with virtuoso artists commanding a mesmerised following .
Beuys 's response , always , to the philistine response of " I could do that – I could find something and put it in an art gallery ; anyone could " was always : " Of course you could ; why on earth do you believe the creation of art to be something beyond your capacities ?
Who taught you that ? "
The liberation of art within Duchamp 's Fountain and the other " readymades " took a long time to appreciate .
The version displayed at Tate Modern from this week is one of half a dozen replicas certified by Duchamp , 50 years after the original was first exhibited , and much of Duchamp has had to be reconstructed in this way .
Most of the original " readymades " were thrown away or misplaced , or perhaps , as in the case of the hatrack , it just started being used for its original purpose .
Duchamp was a paradoxical master ; somebody who made both a complex theoretical contribution , and the most lovable and forgivable of charlatans – anyone who thinks there is no element of the charlatan in Duchamp has understood , frankly , nothing .
He was somebody who opened the way for the slacker , the anti-authoritarian , the Zen contemplator of emptiness and small moments of anonymous poetry , while remaining the most charismatic , disciplined and powerfully individual of artists .
Some people will always maintain that Duchamp 's gesture is not art , perhaps mistaking a statement of factual category for a critical judgement of excellence .
Others go on maintaining that it only needed to be done once , and nothing afterwards would ever have the shock or the fascination of that initial display of 1917 .
That misses the point .
Duchamp knew perfectly well that , with the public display of Fountain , he was taking off a lid that was screwed down tightly , with immediate and explosive effect .
There was never going to be the slightest possibility that it could be screwed down again afterwards .
Art had escaped , and was enveloping the world .

Fountainhead : Duchamp ’s disciples
By Rob Sharp
Richard Hamilton
Hamilton , 86 , has been described as " era-defining " and " Pop Art 's intellectual father " .
He is one of Britain 's most distinguished Pop artists ; a " Pop Daddy " , if you will .
He designed the cover of The Beatles ' White Album and the poster in 1968 .
Hamilton has written extensively about Duchamp .
He says : " Duchamp was iconoclastic .
He questioned anything that happened before , and he clearly tried to create a work which was unique .
I say a work ; I mean , his life work ; his life 's work was something that was completely unique and had never been done before and I think that 's quite deliberate . "
Cai and Xi
The Japanese performance artists achieved fame by romping on Tracey Emin 's My Bed at the Tate Gallery in 1999 .
She was not amused ; they said they were searching for a " new route " in art .
A year later , the duo urinated on Duchamp 's Fountain at the newly opened Tate Modern , but were prevented from soiling the work directly by a Perspex case .
Tate said they were threatening " works of art and our staff " and banned them from the premises .
Asked why they felt they had to " add " to Duchamp 's work , Cai said : " The urinal is there – it's an invitation .
As Duchamp said himself , it 's the artist 's choice .
He chooses what is art .
We just added to it . "
Grayson Perry
The Turner Prize - winning transvestite potter Grayson Perry admits his work is influenced by Duchamp , but is keen to distance himself from him in the cross - dressing department .
Earlier this month , Perry , 47 , said that unlike Duchamp , he does n't have a female alter ego .
For those who were n't quite sure what he meant , he explained : " I'm a transvestite – a man in a dress . "
Perry 's views on Duchamp 's contribution to art are more profound .
" Since Duchamp a century ago , anything an artist chooses can be art .
Now , when judging it , I have to make sure that I am using the specific criteria that measure quality in an art work .
I look at a work now and think : I like this .
But am I drawn to it because the juicy red bits would look great next to my yellow sofa or because I agree with its political statement , or because it is a masterpiece ? "
Richard Wentworth
Wentworth emerged during the 1980s as one of Britain 's most striking sculptors .
He makes direct reference to the subversive Gallic urinal merchant in a recent piece called If Only , in which Duchamp 's 1914 Bottle Rack ( in France , these were used to dry empty wine - bottles ) is spliced by a vertical piece of glass .
The 61 - year - old said recently : " I think Duchamp is like accepting your grand parentage .
It is like [ such artists ] made an enormous space in which you were allowed to be 50 , 60 years later . "
Peter Blake
The pointy - bearded Pop artist once depicted Duchamp travelling around the world on a " rock ' * ' roll tour bus " in a famous collection of paintings .
In this series , which were featured in a retrospective last year , the artist meets the Spice Girls and Elvis Presley , and even plays chess with Tracey Emin .
" Duchamp was very important to me as a young artist , " Blake , 76 , said recently .
" He 's also been very important to the YBAs [ Young British Artists ] .
They could n't have existed without him .
Which is why I put Tracey Emin in .
So in a way I 'm thanking him by sending him on this wonderful world tour in the afterlife . "
Blake has also said : " Thank you to Duchamp .
I am giving him the gift of living forever .
Everybody in the 21st century owes a debt to him . "
Damien Hirst
The world 's most lucrative contemporary artist has paid homage to all and sundry in his various splutterings about contemporary art – but Duchamp was responsible for launching the movement on which his considerable fame and fortune were originally founded .
In one recent interview , Hirst , 42 , declared : " Duchamp and Picasso I 'm interested in ...
What about [ Richard ] Hamilton ?
Do n't you think he should be important ?
It just seems a little weird to me that [ many artists ' influences are ] all Americans .
The big ones .
Throughout history ...
It seems a bit of an imbalance , d'you know what I mean ? "
Jon Stewart : Report provided ' scientific basis for irrational discomfort around gay people ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Wednesday July 18 , 2007 Print This Email
This " I 'm not a fan of personal vendetta gotcha - style politics , " said Jon Stewart on Tuesday 's Daily Show .
" But there can be exceptions .
Take Louisiana Senator David Vitter ... who came to prominence in the 90's demanding President Clinton 's impeachment for the Monica Lewinsky affair .
Well , it seems the condom is on the other foot . "
" Last week , Vitter became the highest profile john implicated in the DC Madam scandal - gate , " Stewart explained .
" Kind of reminds you of the old saying , ' The only thing I trust less than a Louisiana senator sleeping with a hooker is one that is n't . ' "
" But obviously there are bigger fish to fry , " continued Stewart , showing a clip of former Surgeon General Richard Carmona saying , " I was invited to speak at the special Olympics overseas , in Japan .
That was denied .
... I was told , ' Are n't you aware who is behind all of this ?
Why would you help those people ? " '
" Let 's make this clear , " said Stewart .
" He was told he could not help the Special Olympics because the Kennedy 's support the group .
Now , I can understand throwing mentally disabled children under a bus if it were the Clintons .
But the Kennedy's ?
It seems almost petty . "
Stewart finally turned to the man nominated to replace Carmona , James W. Holsinger , author of the report " Pathophysiology of Male Homosexuality , " issued by the Methodist Church in 1991 .
" Apparently , the surgeon general 's report from 1991 was designed to let religious leaders know there was a scientific basis for their irrational discomfort around gay people , " said Stewart .
He then showed Holsinger saying , " The paper does not represent where I am today " and commented mockingly , " I mean , come on , I was a kid , you know , experimenting with homophobia .
I did n't stay with it . "
The following video is from Comedy Central 's The Daily Show , broadcast on July 17 .
How much is inside a can of Dust Off ?
For those of you unfamiliar with " Dust Off " , It is air in a can .
Yes , I know , it seemed like a rip - off to me too , but the marketing secret is that they cram so much air in there that it sprays out with the force of a water cannon , using puffs of air instead of a devastating ramrod of liquid discipline .
It is hard to tell how much is inside because there is never enough dust around to find out , unless you live in the Overlook hotel or something .
In order to accurately quantify a can of Dust Off , I had to fabricate a giant patch of dust .
Thanks to my baking experience , I had the perfect solution : powdered sugar .
With a couple of colanders I set about preparing a fine blanket of dusty powder in the parking lot behind my house .
Dust off was invented by two entrepreneurial nightclub owners in Trenton , New Jersey .
The year was1988 .
They needed a quick way to remove unwanted angel dust from their pure marijuana cigarettes .
One night , A graffiti- artist friend brought in an empty spray - paint can and showed them how the leftover compressed gasses could be used to get incredibly high .
A few weeks later , when they got out of the hospital , a product called " Dust off " was born .
I prefer C& H sugar , it is pure white , disperses easily and settles evenly .
I use it at home , outdoors and in the office .
In the four pound bag there is enough powdered sugar to dust 384 square feet , or fill about 28 envelopes .
I should n't joke about Dust off .
It is a serious product .
It even states that it is a serious product on the can .
How many other products inform you of their serious nature ?
Not radiator fluid , not bleach .
Not shotgun shells , Altoids or even home pregnancy tests tell you how serious they are .
In this respect , Dust off is the opposite of silly string .
Dust Off cannot stand being called " instant party " .
Soon I had created a vast , hot dusty area to perform my wacky experiments .
I dubbed this area " the playa " .
With my proving grounds prepared , I opened up the can of dust off and affixed the complimentary coffee stirrer to the spray nozzle .
The powdered sugar did n't stand a chance as the Dust Off did its work .
I felt like an illegal immigrant at the Willy Wonka chocolate factory , carefully spraying sugar from the blacktop with my little can .
As the can emptied , it got cold .
Very cold .
Ice started to form on the outside of the can and the air flow slowed down quite a bit .
This cooling effect is caused by the change of pressure in the can , but the explanation is really long - winded , so instead I 'm going to blame ....
BLACK MAGIC and VOODOO !
The tiny demons in the can are flying out !
The heat of the can is dropping so fast the can is freezing !
Bad spirits !
Bad Juju !
While I was busy speaking in tongues and shaking my crows foot , Rob J. took over spraying the sugar .
It took longer than I expected .
They really pack the difluoroethane in there !
With a final gasp , the can expired .
It had cleared 41 square feet of dust .
I was genuinely impressed .
We never get snow in Sacramento , so I took this opportunity to make an old style sugar angel .
Most of the three parking spaces were still covered with sugar .
I ran over the cherry - filled donuts in my haste to get into this sweet parking spot .
Rob and Helen wanted a shot at the donuts too , so I moved my car to give them a try .
Rob hit them easily , but regretted it soon afterwards , when he was washing the tart cherry goo off of his paint job .
When we bought our first house last year , funny things started happening to me .
I found myself subscribing to every Martha Stewart - esque magazine I could get my hands on ( and the anti-Martha " ¦I highly recommend ReadyMade ) .
A part of this new , domesticated me included a completely newfound urge to garden .
Guess what ?
My thumb did n't get any greener when we acquired a mortgage .
I 've killed pumpkins , grown a tomato - free tomato plant , and demolished not one , not two , but three hanging baskets of different varieties .
I 'm working on a fourth .
Despite killing everything I touch , I 'm still determined to get some cool plants .
Below are a few that I look forward to brutally massacring sometime in the near future .
Plant : The Sensitive Plant
What Makes it Cool :
When the plant is touched , its leaves immediately fold together .
They do the same thing at night due to the absence of light .
How I Will Eventually Kill it : Probably by letting it stay out on our porch too late in the season .
The Sensitive Plant suffers when temperatures drop below 65 degrees .
( Also known as the TickleMe Plant , the Shame Plant and the Prayer Plant )
Plant : The Bladderwort
What Makes it Cool :
It 's carnivorous .
Any organism that gets too close to the tiny hairs on the bladderwort will trigger the trap and thus be sucked into the bladder chamber of the plant , where it starts to be digested .
Although it sounds like something out of Little Shop of Horrors , the trap is so tiny that it can only catch small insects like mosquito larvae .
How I Will Eventually Kill it :
It 's mainly aquatic , so chances are pretty good that I will try to plant it in soil .
Plant : The Corpse Lily
What Makes it Cool :
It smells like decaying flesh or rotting meat .
And it 's actually kind of ugly .
And it has no leaves or stems .
And it only blooms for a week every year .
OK , it 's just a really strange plant .
How I Will Eventually Kill it : I will never get a shot at this one , actually , because it 's endangered and only grows in the rain forests of Sumatra and in the Malay Archipelago in Borneo .
Plant : The Walking Iris
What Makes it Cool : New plantlets develop where the previous flowers were on the Iris .
The stalk keeps growing , though , so as the plantlet grows , its weight draws the stalk down to the ground .
When the plantlet finally rests on the ground , it roots there .
This makes it look like the Iris is " walking "  across the yard .
How I Will Eventually Kill it :
It grows in clumps up to five feet wide , so I imagine I will mow over it at some point .
Plant : The Money Plant , AKA the Honesty Plant
What Makes it Cool :
It grows flattened pods that look like silver dollars and make cool rustling noises in a breeze .
How I Will Eventually Kill it :
It 's listed as a " beginner "  plant , which means it should be easy to grow .
" Easy to grow "  is pretty much the kiss of death for me .
I killed a philodendron .
Plant : Resurrection Fern
What Makes It Cool :
It knows how to play dead .
During drought periods , the fern goes grey and curls up , appearing to be completely dead .
When it receives even a tiny bit of water , it turns lush and green again .
Some have estimated that it could be resurrected after up to 100 years .
How I Will Eventually Kill it : I think even I can't fully kill something that can resurrect itself .

The recording was made using a phonautograph
Ancient audio
An " ethereal " 10 second clip of a woman singing a French folk song has been played for the first time in 150 years .
The recording of " Au Clair de la Lune " , recorded in 1860 , is thought to be the oldest known recorded human voice .
A phonograph of Thomas Edison singing a children 's song in 1877 was previously thought to be the oldest record .
The new " phonautograph " , created by etching soot - covered paper , has now been played by US scientists using a " virtual stylus " to read the lines .
" When I first heard the recording as you hear it ... it was magical , so ethereal , " audio historian David Giovannoni , who found the recording , told AP .
" The fact is it 's recorded in smoke .
The voice is coming out from behind this screen of aural smoke . "
Sheet music
The short song was captured on April 9 , 1860 by a phonautograph , a device created by a Parisian inventor , Edouard - Leon Scott de Martinville .
The device etched representations of sound waves into paper covered in soot from a burning oil lamp .
Lines were scratched into the soot by a needle moved by a diaphragm that responded to sound .
The recordings were never intended to be played .
It was retrieved from Paris by Mr Giovanni , working with First Sounds , a group of audio historians , recording engineers and sound archivists who aim to make mankind 's earliest sound recordings available to all .
To retrieve the sounds scientists at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory ( LBNL ) in California made very high - resolution digital scans of the paper and used a " virtual stylus " to read the scrawls .
However , because the phonautograph recordings were made using a hand - cranked device , the speed varied throughout , changing the pitch .
" If someone 's singing at middle C and the crank speeds up and slows down , the waves change shape and are shifting , Earl Cornell , a scientist at LBNL , told AP .
" We had a tuning fork side by side with the recording , so you can correct the sound and speed variations . "
Previously , the oldest known recorded voice was thought to be Thomas Edison 's recording of Mary had a little lamb .
The inventor of the light bulb recorded the stanza to test another of his inventions - the phonograph - in 1877 .
" It does n't take anything away from Thomas Edison , in my opinion , " Mr Giovannoni told Reuters .
" But actually , the truth is he was the first person to have recorded [ sound ] and played it back . "
The new recording will be presented on 28 March at a conference of the Association for Recorded Sound Collections at Stanford University in California .

What are these ?
Firstly .
A big thank you to all of you for putting up with the server problems that accompanied the arrival of my first blog essay , or blessay as I quite horribly prefer to call it .
I thank you all for your suggestions , tips , links and comments .
I ca n’t reply to all the points raised , but I will say that ( A ) the Nokia E series iSync plugin just simply does n’t work for me , nor do any third party offerings .
“ Unexpected error ” .
I shall wait till Missing Sync come up with their solution which is due soon and ( B ) no , I do n’t want my iPhone hacked or cracked , thanks very much for the offer .
We may return to the geeky side of my life a little later .
This blessay , while entirely different in other respects , is also unaccountably and inexcusably prolix .
Sorry about that , I do n’t seem to be able to keep things brief .
So my advice is that you read it in bits .
Or print it out and save it for a rainy day or a recalcitrant motion .
I will try to produce more traditional ‘ dear diary ’ style down - and - dirty blogs if that ’s what you would prefer , but I advise you to be prepared to expect a mixture of the long and the short .
My subject this week is Fame … .
Let Fame , that all hunt after in their lives , Live registered upon our brazen tombs …
I have been pondering this business of fame since I was young enough to know Valerie Singleton from the Queen ( for Americans and other non-Britons I should explain : one is a remote , god - like , autocratic woman endowed with powerful charismatic charm and the other is a constitutional monarch recently played on screen by Helen Mirren ) .
Some questions will be addressed in the following blessay :
· Is fame really something that “ all hunt after in their lives ” ?
·
Whose fault is fame ?
· Can we postulate a kind of fame meme ?
·
What ’s it like being famous , Stephen ? ·
What are the bad things about being famous ?
The quotation I opened with is so firmly branded on my memory that I have no need to check it : it ’s from the beginning of Love ’s Labour ’s Lost .
When I was in a student production nearly 30 years ago Hugh Laurie played the King of Navarre and was incapable of delivering those opening lines without giggling ; what set him off was catching the eye of Paul Schlesinger , who played Berowne .
This happens on stage ; I remember having a similar problem with John Gordon Sinclair – the only way we could get through some scenes of The Common Pursuit was by looking away from each other .
It ’s a chemical thing , like a kind of ( mostly ) benign allergy , impossible to explain or predict .
Anyway , Hugh Laurie had the affliction big time with Paul Schlesinger .
So much so that the harassed director , Brigid Larmour , was forced to get the entire company of attendant lords to intone the opening speech tutti , as a kind of chant or oath , to draw attention away from the corpsing .
Brigid Larmour is now artistic director of the Watford Theatre , Paul Schlesinger is the head of BBC Radio Entertainment and Hugh Laurie has disappeared into oblivion .
How the whirligig of time brings in its revenges .
I played Don Armado incidentally , a character with the best description in any of the Shakespearean dramatic personae : he is “ Don Armado , a fantastical Spaniard ” .
Only I was Don Armado , a fantastical Mexican because … oh , it ’s another story altogether .
Intro
For the duration of much of what follows it might be a good idea if you cast yourself as famous .
Much of success in life comes from being able to put yourself in the shoes of another : in the shoes of a prince or a pauper , a dictator or a dick - head , a burgomaster or a burger - flipper , regardless of degree , status or esteem , it ’s what imagination means – the ability to penetrate the consciousness and experience of another .
It ’s perhaps the defining characteristic of the artist .
So , rather than look at fame from the outside which we can all do ( only members of a royal family are born famous after all ) try in the following paragraphs to look at fame from the inside .
I ’m not suggesting this because I think famous people need especial understanding or sympathy , it ’s just that I suspect much of what ’s written below will make more sense that way .
Besides , is n’t it the best way to read anything ?
Only resentful bores and bitter egoists see everything from their own point of view , surely ?
Fame .
It ’s an embarrassing thing to talk about , for all that it is a national / global obsession .
It is one of the few apparently desirable human qualities that … no , what am I talking about … it is not a quality .
It is not like courage , mercy , kindness , strength , beauty or patience ; or laziness , dishonesty , greed or cruelty for that matter .
What is different about fame , I was going to say , is that it is so contingent .
If you are tolerant or strong or wise , you are tolerant and strong and wise wherever you are on the planet that day .
You do n’t become bigoted , feeble and dim - witted the moment you cross a continent .
Famous people however , can become entirely unknown the second they leave their homeland .
Only the World Famous are famous everywhere , and there are precious few of them .
They used to claim Mohammed Ali was about as well - known as a human could be , the same was said of Charlie Chaplin and Elvis .
Who now ?
Osama bin Laden ?
Michael Jackson ?
Robbie Williams can walk around Los Angeles without being recognised and they say Johnny Carson was so surprised / irked / mortified at going unremarked in London whenever he showed up , as he did regularly for Wimbledon Fortnight , that he arranged for British TV to carry his Tonight Show at a reduced rate .
Martha Stewart can travel by Tube unspotted , but not by Subway .
And so on .
As for myself , well , I mean next to nothing in Italy , but seem to strike a chord in Russia .
Do n’t ask .
Fame has this unusual property .
It exists only in the mind of others .
It is not an intrinsic characteristic , feature or achievement .
Fame is wholly an exterior construct and yet , for all that it is defined by other people ’s knowledge of a given person , they cannot dismantle or deactivate the fame that their knowledge engenders .
What an ugly sentence .
I mean this .
We cannot , however much we may want to , make someone unfamous .
We can make them infamous , unfashionable , notorious , despised or derided but the more we do so the more we actually increase their level of fame .
Fame is a function of memory .
I ca n’t impel you to forget Adam Sandler , for example , any more than I can instruct you to forget Jack the Ripper or the Jolly Green Giant .
Indeed , as I ’ve suggested , to urge someone to forget is worse than useless .
It ’s like the well - known procedure of telling someone not to think of something specific and odd , a yellow panda , for example .
Go on , do not think of a yellow panda .
There , the image of such a being is now in your head .
Fame is a great bouncy castle that we have all blown up to its present state by breathing the names of the famous .
Simply in mentioning ‘ Adam Sandler ’
I have inflated his fame by a cubic millimetre .
It will only deflate , over time , if his name is never uttered .
Given his slate of disgustingly maudlin films over the last five years ( with the exception of the wonderful Punch Drunk Love ) , I ca n’t help feeling that would n’t be a bad idea , but this is an entirely separate argument .
For fame is not the same as reputation .
Fame can outstrip reputation , but reputation cannot outstrip fame .
For example , while Kipling ’s fame has been great since his death , his reputation has wavered , one minute down in the cellar , the next back up to almost the height it attained in his lifetime .
Ditto , more or less at random , the pre-Raphaelites , Oliver Wendell Holmes and Bobby Darin .
W. B. Yeats is better known these days than Dornford Yates , and that ’s likely to remain true till the crack of doom : two generations ago for every person who had heard of W. B. there were a hundred who knew and read Dornford .
Am I alone in liking both ?
All of which leads me to this obvious point .
It is no good everyone repeating that tiresome cliché about x , y and z ‘ only being famous for being famous ’ – their fame exists in our heads and it is therefore our fault , not theirs , if fault there is .
I ca n’t blame Jade Goody for the fact that I know her name .
Many famous people may well be guilty of being ambitious for fame , for ‘ hunting after it all their lives ’ as in the quotation above , but while I could be guilty of wanting everyone in Britain to send me ten pounds such an ambition is useless unless others are foolish enough to realise it for me .
It is our curiosity , admiration , idolatry , envy , rage , resentment or obsession that privileges the famous with their fame and the only way we can take it away from them is by forgetting .
Which is hard .
And it ’s no good saying : “ it ’s not my fault Abi Titmus is famous … it ’s other people who have made her so ” – the very act of uttering that sentence has spread the infection , has transmitted the fame meme .
Yes the media institutions , the newspapers , television and indeed internet have a part to play as pipelines , but the energy that drives the fame along those pipelines derives more from the receiver than the transmitter , it is more suck than blow .
The Pheme .
This would combine a resurrection of the Greek notion of Pheme , the spirit or embodiment of fame , ( Roman equivalent Fama ) with the meme proposed by Richard Dawkins ( do visit his site – fine place , intellectually stimulating but non-combative and you can buy a cool atheist A t- shirt ) .
Let the pheme ƒ be the gene of celebrity , the base unit of fame ; its only function is to replicate itself by planting the awareness of a given famous person , x , into the host minds of the masses , m .
The pheme of x , ƒ (x ) does not demand that you like x , respect them , admire them or even know much about them , only that you are conscious of them enough to pass on the pheme in some manner .
In fact , I would suggest that a negative attitude to x actually transmits the pheme more powerfully .
The fame of someone despised or caught with their hand in the till , a straw up their nose or their knob up an inappropriate fleshly passage transmits more rapidly than the fame of one who has invented something useful or created something beautiful .
Interestingly , the collective unconscious of the Greeks ( characteristically as wise , poetic and insightful as their conscious philosophy ) personifies Pheme as a many - tongued gossip , rather like Rumour in 16th and 17th century English allegories .
For a pheme is transmitted by speech , or more properly , by utterance , written or spoken .
I ’ll leave the mathematical modelling and notation to cleverer heads than mine , but I do n’t doubt that some sort of descriptive formula can be produced which will allow us to see how phemes work over time and across populations .
More characteristics of Fame .
A good metaphor for fame is the magnifying glass .
It makes larger ( which is what magnify means ) exposing flaws as well as qualities .
The blackheads and dirty pores are there for all to see .
Like a magnifying glass fame can distort , it can invert and it can ( with the glare of publicity behind it ) focus the light into a terrible heat that burns the subject until they shrivel into nothing .
In some professions fame is a by - product , an incidental , a “ way of keeping score ” .
If you are a brilliant cricketer , one of the best in the world , then as many as two billion people might know who you are .
Even more if you are a successful footballer .
A maximum of a quarter of a billion will know who you are if you are a successful American footballer , but at least 5 billion will know you if you are an American footballer accused of murdering your wife and her lover .
The OJ pheme buried itself deep in all of us and will , one suspects , remain in circulation for a long time .
But then society thought the same of the Roscoe ‘ Fatty ’
Arbuckle scandal which is now , if not an obscure footnote , certainly far from being the cause celebre of the century despite its seismic notoriety at the time .
If you write books , sing songs , act in films , read the news etc etc , fame will come as a consequence of popular success in those fields as surely as a cough will come to a coalminer .
If you murder people on a sufficiently impressive scale , either as an individual or a political leader , your name will get around that way too .
It goes without saying that fame has nothing to do with the quality of your achievement .
Dan
Thingy who wrote the Leonardo Code or whatever it was called , is fairly well known now but will be as unheard of as Rafael Sabatini or James Hilton in fifty years time ( though they deserve more fame than he ever did ) .
Tim Berners - Lee is possibly less well known than Bernard Lee ( M in the early Bond movies ) , but in the future the reverse will be true .
And so on .
Dan Whatsit and his preposterously awful Leonardo book are actually relevant to our theme .
I usually last longer with any best - selling novel , however pathetic , than I did with his .
But in his case I knew from the very first word that this was a writer of absolutely zero interest , insight , wit , understanding or ability .
A blunderer of monumental incompetence .
The first word , can you credit it , is ‘ renowned ’ .
‘ Renowned symbologist Henry Titfeather ….’ or something equally drivelling , that ’s how this dreadful book opens .
How do you begin to explain to someone that you just do n’t start a fictional story by telling your readers that your character is ‘ renowned ’ ?
You show it , you do n’t tell it .
Lord Reith , founder of the BBC , legendarily fired off an angry memo to his staff after a broadcast in which someone or other was described as “ the famous lawyer ” .
The memo went like this : ‘ The word FAMOUS .
If a person is famous it is superfluous to point out the fact , if they are not then it is a lie .
The word is not to be used within the BBC . ’
Way to tell them , Scottish guy .
Of course those for whom money is important will tell me that Dan Doodah is ‘ laughing all the way to the bank ’ and that his sales are all the approbation he needs .
Well those who think money is any more reliable than fame as an index of worth are already beyond help .
Eat shit , a trillion flies ca n’t be wrong .
Or as someone once said , ( Dorothy Parker if you believe the online quotation pages , which I do n’t – I mean do they ever show sources or give chapter and verse ? ) :
‘ If you want to know what God thinks of money , just look at the kind of people he gives it to . ’
Of course Dan Whosit is a success , of course he ’s reasonably famous at the moment .
I do n’t begrudge him a cent of his money or a breath of his ‘ renown ’ .
The awfulness of his book is only of interest because it is so successful , precisely because it has become so ‘ renowned ’ .
There are hundreds of thousands of books a year published that are bad , it says nothing about the authors .
The success of Leonard ’s Code is all about and only about the mass of people who bought it and thought it had a vestige of quality or authenticity and so caused the spread of its pheme .
This is true of all fame : it ’s not about the famous , it ’s about those who make them famous and why .
‘ The fault , dear Brutus , is not in our stars , but in our selves … ’
Cassius ’s observation works with the modern meaning of ‘ star ’ too .
Fame has this in its favour : you ca n’t fake it and it ’s absolutely no good arguing over its existence , it ’s as provable as anything can be .
We could wrangle over whether or not Dan Howdoyoudo can write , but we ca n’t argue about whether or not he ’s famous .
Mind you , he ca n’t be that famous if I ca n’t recall his surname … Brown !
Damn , I suddenly remembered .
I was n’t going to look it up but had planned to rely on it either springing into my head or not and , annoyingly , it just has ( or “ it just did ” , as Americans would say ) .
He is , or rather the phenomenon of his dreadful book is , certainly famous .
Whether or not I have the right to append the adjective “ dreadful ” to his work is however a matter for debate , ultimately a question of taste ( ie , if you have taste you agree with me , if you have n’t you do n’t – no but shush ) .
Dan Brown is famous , but not significant .
Tim Berners - Lee is significant , but not famous .
Mind you , interesting how cold Dan Brown has become recently .
The ‘ phenomenon ’ has dried up and already feels as embarrassingly dated as Bri Nylon shirts or backwards baseball caps , but without the kitsch retro appeal .
My Fame Alright , I ’ve hedged enough .
What does fame really mean to the famous ?
I am pretty well - known in my own country , I ca n’t deny that .
It would be a false modesty weird enough to count as vanity to pretend otherwise .
I get stopped on the street , I get ( occasionally ) hounded by photographers , I get letters from strangers asking for money , sex , advice , approval , time and so on .
Journalists with nothing better to do write descriptions of my personality or offer glancing mentions of me .
People who have never met me know that they loathe me , or that they like me .
I am asked to be patron of this charity and to be on the board of that good cause and so on .
I can get a table at the Ivy restaurant and tickets for premieres and parties .
A medium ranking sleb .
Not A list , but not Z either .
I ’ve been in this position for the best part of a quarter of a century .
Is it fun ?
Or , as student journalists always ask , what ’s it like ?
‘ What ’s it like working with Natalie Portman , what ’s it like doing QI , what ’s it like being famous ? ’
I do n’t know what it is like .
What is being English like ?
What is wearing a hat like ?
What ’s eating Thai red curry like ?
I do n’t believe that I can answer any question formulated that way .
So , student journalists , tyro profilers and rooky reporters out there , seriously , quite seriously never ask a ‘ what ’s it like ’ question , it instantly reveals your crapness .
I used to try getting surreal when asked the question and say things like ‘ being famous is like wearing blue pyjamas at the opera .
It ’s like kissing Neil Young , but only on Wednesdays .
It ’s like a silver disc gummed to the ear of a wolverine .
It ’s like licking crumbs from the belly of a waitress called Eileen .
It ’s like lemon polenta cake but slightly wider .
It ’s like moonrise on the planet Posker . ’
I mean honestly .
What ’s it like ??
Stop it at once .
No , but really Stephen , what is it like , being famous ?
Go on .
Oh , very well then .
I can only tell you what being famous as Stephen Fry is ‘ like ’ , of course .
I suppose there must be some elements to the experience that I have in common with other famous people , but in the end being famous as Stephen Fry is not the same as being famous as Carl Sagan or David Furnish or Vernon Kaye .
I ’ll start with a story that illustrates exactly one aspect of that point .
15 or so years ago I was filming a TV drama called Stalag Luft in Harrogate with Nicholas Lyndhurst .
After a couple of nights sampling the hotel ’s room service menu we decided to totter into town and try our luck in an Indian restaurant .
We were spotted by a group of young Harro … young Harrogaters ?
Harrovians wo n’t do it .
Whatever , a sample of Harrogate youth button - holed us .
They hailed Nicholas in a strange blend of North Yorkshire and attempted South London , punching him playfully but quite forcefully on the arm and saying ‘ Come on Rodney , you fucking plonker , give us your autograph , you daft cunt . ’
They roughhoused him like this as he patiently signed , and then they turned to me , all but doffing their caps , and asked in a very polite tone , ‘ Excuse me , Mr Fry , but can we have your autograph too ? ’
Walking away from this encounter Lyndhurst said in an aggrieved tone as he rubbed his bruised upper arm : ‘ What the hell was that about ?
I get called a cunt and violently punched and you get “ excuse me Mr Fry ” ???’.
‘ Ah , ’ I said , ‘ thing is , you play everyone ’s favourite younger brother and so they treat you like a younger brother , while I play generals and lawyers and bishops and they treat me accordingly . ’
‘ Right , that ’s it , ’ said Nick , ‘ from now on it ’s bishops and generals only . ’
So , being famous - as - me has its advantages .
I am perceived ( and whether this might be right or wrong , accurate or inaccurate , is for the purposes of our discussion neither here not there ) as being authoritative , patrician , benign , knowledgeable etc etc , whatever , whatever .
Therefore I am treated rather differently to those who are adjudged to have other qualities .
On the one hand I am not slapped on the back or punched in the arm much , on the other I am not an object of sexual thrill or a youthful role - model in the way a footballer , musician or soap star might be .
One advantage I have over some is that my fame came pretty slowly .
I left university in 1981 and over the next three or four years did a bit of this and a bit of that – a TV series called Alfresco for Granada that was not exactly a major hit , a stage production of an Alan Bennett play and the second series of Blackadder followed without setting the world on fire .
By about 1986 I was starting to get used to being stopped in the street or supermarket a little .
Say once or twice a week .
The girl who thought she had seen me somewhere before , was it at a History lecture ?
The old lady who told me that my language was a disgrace , the man who thought I was a local newsreader , that kind of thing .
Over the next few years as more television was done , Blackadders , Fry and Lauries and Jeeves and Woosters , the being - recognised - thing became something I had adjusted to .
And over those same years it became more likely that they would know my name as well as my face .
In other words I drip - fed into the public consciousness by a sort of osmotic absorption .
My pheme was a slow attritional one .
I was not like a soap star , teen idol or reality TV participant who , in the ( famous ) words of Lord Byron , wake up to find themselves famous .
Their phemes rage and they are the people who usually find fame hardest to handle .
They are typically very young and , by definition , they have not had four or five years to habituate themselves to the experience of being recognised .
Rudeness , sulky gracelessness , drugs , drink , temper tantrums and so on are often the result .
If they do n’t have the imagination to know how much courage it takes for a member of the public to approach a famous person , then they let themselves down badly with their curt off - hand manner or their whining self - pity .
Of course , it cuts both ways , plenty of members of the public do n’t seem to have the imagination to understand what it ’s like to be approached .
As with all such social interactions therefore , a little from each is what ’s required .
Small sidebar .
I ’m afraid there are plenty of words used by slebs to describe non-slebs .
Here are some I ’ve heard .
Mops / moppets – silly .
It stands for Members Of the Public .
Civilians – reasonable , but a bit John Goodman in The Big Lebowski .
Ordinaries – ouch .
Muggles – obvious and quite sweet I suppose .
Punters – naff .

I ’m sure there are many others .
And now I ’m sensing a certain amount of antagonism from some .
How dare such valueless , vulgar , shallow little people with their adventitious so - called ‘ celebrity ’ develop a contemptuous slang for the decent , hard - working people who pay for these cheap weasels in the first place ?
Hm ?
Hm ?????
Well yes , but we ’re all human beings here .
You would do the same .
It ’s not about being rude and one of the reasons you ’d do the same is SCALE .
Scale matters .
If you ’re accosted on average once a week , it ’s charming .
You can give a little time to the one who stopped you , be delighted by their knowing who you are and the whole thing can be a most pleasant and mutually satisfying interchange .
If you are stopped every ten minutes then it ’s a whole different deal .
You keep your head down , pretend to be on the phone , wear dark glasses and generally hope to pass unnoticed .
Or you get someone else to do your shopping , tube travelling and general street - using for you , sitting in the back of a Lexus most days and never interacting with the rest of the human race except when surrounded by burly security men who place their palms in the faces of anyone who dares to come near .
Which is sad and can engender the reputation of being standoffish , grand and all the rest of it , but if the alternative is not being able to move around very easily , who can blame those afflicted with that level of fame ?
It ’s the same with letters .
Twenty to fifty a week you can just about keep on top of , reply to personally , strike up friendships , establish cordial relationships and so forth .
Ten times that amount and rising and it ’s all your secretary can do to filter the ones you might want to see from the ones that threaten to burn down your house and scratch your car .
You ’re the same person , no ruder , more off - hand or nonchalant than you were , but the scale alters how you can behave .
The scale enforces a kind of distance that may be alien to your natural bonhomie .
The Tom Cruise Eye- Contact Canard Poor old Tom Cruise .
If only I had a euro for everyone who has said to me in tones of wild , almost joyful disapproval , ‘ apparently no one is allowed to look at him on the film set ! ’
( Actually the link I ’ve embedded just there also shows how these ‘ stories ’ can be skewed for the purposes of some raving agenda , in this case a right - wing one ) .
‘ Eye contact is banned !!
I ’m not making it up !!
How mad is that ?!
Extras and crew are actually instructed not to stare at him !!’
In fact , a little imagination of the kind I asked you to summon up earlier and you might be able to picture this scenario : Tom Cruise ( but you actually , because you ’ve put yourself in his shoes ) is about to do an important scene which involves hundreds of extras .
He has to break down / shout / burst into tears / whatever .
He comes on set to finish the camera line - up and get ready to shoot .
Wherever he tries to rest his eyes there is someone staring at him .
He is working , mind you , earning his fantastic salary ( or if not earning it in your opinion , complying at least with its contractual imperatives ) , this is what he does , it takes concentration and skill , you may not value it , but take it from me , it is n’t easy .
He has to prepare himself for whatever is required and then repeat the performance time after time for different camera angles .
Put yourself in his position : you ’re going to have to do something wild and daring in front of the camera and as you try to put yourself in the correct frame of mind there is nowhere to rest your eyes .
Is it unreasonable to say to the Assistant Director , ‘ would you mind asking all the background artists if they would n’t stare at me ?
Actually , knowing Asst. Directors , they would probably foresee the problem and make the announcement without consulting him even before Cruise ever arrived : ‘ no one to stare at Mr Cruise when he ’s on set . ’
This gets repeated , comes to the ear of gossip columnists , mad republicans and others and it soon sounds like insane vain stardom all over again .
When I was playing Wilde I had the same problem getting ready for the scene where Oscar comes out of the courtroom in handcuffs and is jeered and spat at .
As the scene was being lit I could n’t look in any direction without meeting the gaze of an extra , so I spent all the time staring at my boots or into a corner , like a naughty boy at kindergarten .
I did n’t ask the AD if she ’d put out a request for them not to look at me , but if I were in the same position again I might .
Or I would spend the whole time in my trailer until the very , very last minute , which is bad for the director , the crew and the performance , not to mention the reputation of the actor who is forever set down in people ’s minds as a Trailer Queen .
But see how easily rumours of mad egoism get round ?
I ’m not saying there are n’t wild egos amongst the famous , but sometimes it ’s just a lack of imagination amongst the non-famous that sees insanity where all that lies behind it is professionalism and self - preservation .
Many people of course have an ardent desire to want the famous to be deranged , spoiled , stupid and impossible to live with and perhaps some of you reading this will still choose not to believe me , preferring your image of star as pampered idiot child monster .
It ’s too much to bear that they have all the money , adulation and opportunity in the world , so let ’s console ourselves with the thought that they ’re deranged imbeciles so far up themselves it hurts .
It is interesting is n’t it how very , very important money becomes ( even to the most apparently spiritual ) when criticising a famous person .
‘ What are they complaining about ?
They ’re paid enough are n’t they ? ’ as if money compensates for all things .
Maybe it does in some people ’s minds .
‘ I ’d put up with any amount of shit if I was paid that much . ’
Would you indeed , how noble of you .
I ’ve seen enough of the very famous close up , film stars , sportsmen and musicians , to know it ’s a pretty miserable fate .
Happy superstars are a rare sight .
Not many seem to want to believe that , but it ’s true .
Be yourself Plenty of people have said to me in supermarkets in slightly affronted tones ‘ what are you doing here ? ’ as if I had no business being in such a place .
I long ago gave up answering with a silly sarcastic ‘ playing badminton , taking a shower , duh , shopping !’ kind of answer .
The way to respond is with a ‘ gosh , I know !
Is n’t life silly !
Are n’t I daft !’ sort of grin .
‘ Tch , I do n’t know !
Are n’t we barmy just for being !’
For everyone who looks down on a famous person for not shopping in the supermarket or using the bus , there are those outraged to see them doing just that .
Some want our famous people to shop only in a fantasy Famous People Village , to zoom about in limos and use special extra private double - secret VIP lounges – others hate them for doing just that .
The lesson for the sleb is be who you are , not what you think others want you to be .
Otherwise you ’ll get yourself in a pickle by putting on a mockney accent believing that ‘ the people ’ will be impressed by how ‘ real ’ you are , whereas we all know nothing grates more .
Conversely you might give off a false air of dining every night at the Ritz when in fact you ’re happier in the local chippy .
No need .
Be yourself .
Negatives
There are drawbacks to fame , of course there are .
The scaling up and the misinterpretation are two that I ’ve mentioned .
By the way , just as one can have bad hair days , so one can have bad fame days .
There are days when try as I might I can not go unnoticed .
It ’s as if I ’m walking around with a neon sign over my head .
Every cab driver , everyone I pass in the street , every shop assistant stops me and asks for an autograph or photo ( of which more later ) .
I can lower my head , concentrate on looking anonymous , but it ’s no good .
On other days I could lope about in fluorescent clothing meeting everyone ’s gaze and nobody would take any notice .
Seems to defy logic but anyone in the public eye will tell you the same .
‘ Weird , I ’m really famous today , ’ is how one might put it .
Back to drawbacks …
Mood Famous people are not allowed to be in a bad mood in the way that everyone else is .
‘ We made you , we paid you , you will therefore look cheerful and contented ( but not smug ) at all times . ’
This is difficult to live up to .
The day comes to all of us when we ’re not in the best of moods .
It comes to me big time on occasions .
I have made this public by talking about my mood issues , my bipolar disorder , but even if I were n’t so especially afflicted , I would , like any human , have cheerful days and less cheerful days .
But woe betide the famous person who wanders about with a scowl on his face .
Passers - by will read all kinds of things into a sour expression : ‘ what a misery ! ’
‘ I suppose he thinks he should be served first because he ’s famous ! ’
‘ Does he expect us all to bow down and worship him ? ’ etc etc .
All of it incredibly unfair and not something we would presume to read into the facial expressions of a non-famous person , but we ca n’t help it .
They are famous and therefore we can impute all kinds of motives and attitudes .
A daffy smile is therefore at all times de rigueur .
A sort of ‘ tsk , do n’t mind me , I do n’t know , golly is n’t life potty , still must n’t grumble , ho , goodness , I say , do n’t you think , hm ? ” sort of expression that covers all eventualities in an English self - effacing , I ’m - embarrassed - by - my - own - existence sort of way .
Who are you ?
A fair chunk of the population does not care to be reminded that they themselves are not well - known and their default position when it comes to the famous is one of scepticism , contempt , out - of - my - way - I - really - have - no - idea - who - you - are resentment ; expect from them narrow frowning as they stare at you in a way that they really want you to notice : it says , ‘ I think I may have seen you somewhere before , but my life is too busy and my standards too high to know exactly who you might be .
If you care to approach me and tell me who you are I might pay you some attention , but otherwise I find you faintly annoying . ’
“ You must get really fed up … ” A very , very , very popular strategy used by the approacher is to cast themselves in the role of the non-typical fan .
This of course is the most popular method and casts them therefore as utterly typical .
They will say something like ‘ I expect you get really annoyed by people coming up to you …’ as if they are not doing exactly that .
A very , very well known friend of mine once actually called the bluff of this social pretence , which was excessively naughty of him .
It went like this .
Fan :
You must get really annoyed by people coming up to you all the time .
Fameboy : Not at all .
The only thing that really annoys me is people coming up to me and telling me that they expect I get really annoyed …
Fan :
Well , fuck you then !
( exit huffily )
Fan became ex-fan and my friend spent the rest of the decade kicking himself , for he is not usually rude or mean .
It is obvious and wholly understandable that when people approach you they want to present themselves as separate from the herd : they are not aware that the more they attempt to be different the more they are in fact identical .
When I had a crush on Donny Osmond I was convinced that if he could only get to know me he would discover that I was so different from everyone else around him that he would understand how we were meant for each other .
This is Stance A , the Standard Defining Fan Feeling , and covers the beliefs of all fans from obsessive to faint admirer .
Unique Opening Line
As far as I ’m concerned , I really do n’t expect people to be original , and if they were all to say ‘ I expect you get really annoyed …’ ( which they just about do ) I honestly would n’t mind .
Better that than cudgel their brains for some unique opening line .
It ’s common for the Unique Opening Line to be something surreal about biscuits if it ’s a teenage boy or a comment about the shoes / tie one ’s wearing if it ’s a girl .
I do n’t know why , but there we are .
I report as I find .
What I dread most , however , is the Arcane Factoid .
The Arcane Factoid Now that does happen from time to time .
Because of QI I ’m very often asked a trivia question along the lines of ‘ what ’s the name of the plastic thingy at the end of a shoe - lace ? ’ in fact I must have been asked that particular question at least 20 times .
I ’m not exaggerating .
It ’s one of the class of facts that people believe they are the only people in possession of .
Aglet , by the way , is the answer , though as we geeks know , aglet has another meaning too .
As if you did n’t know .
Naturally there are plenty of questions that I do n’t know the answer to , and this allows people to go off happy in the knowledge they have bested me and that I am not the font of all wisdom that I never said I was .
‘ I bumped into that Stephen Fry in Waitrose and he never even knew the name of the dog who found the stolen World Cup ’ or whatever …
If not a factoid a muddle - headed origin .
‘ Did you know that the V - sign comes from the archers at Agincourt ? ’
I have given up replying , ‘ no I did n’t know that , and the reason I did n’t know it is because it is n’t true . ’
People like to believe their derivations and origins , no matter how wrong they are .
Sample dialogue
Now this is all beginning to sound as if I ’m contemptuous of the people who come up to me in the street .
I ’m not .
I ’m genuinely not .
The huge , vast , enormous , colossal , gigantic majority are kind , sweet - natured , friendly , unobtrusive , understanding and delightful .
I ’m merely sharing the experience with you as best I can .
The fact that people say the same kinds of thing does not make them predictable , dull , foolish or uninteresting .
Those who try and come up with something completely original or who fish for some connection ( ‘ my father knew your doctor ’s accountant ’s sister - in - law ’ ) are more tiring and more of an intrusion into one ’s day , certainly .
It would be dishonest of me to deny that and you would n’t trust me if I pretended that I thought all people were equally good company .
You ’d think I was a dick .
Charm should be rewarded .
In the end I it works best when both sides recognise that it ’s a social dance and want to get it over with as quickly as possible .
You : Hello there .
Nice to see you round these parts .
Me : How very kind of you .
Thanks very much .
You :
What brings you to Doncaster ?
Me :
Oh you know , where else would I want to be on a Wednesday ?
You : ( chuckling )
The countryside around is attractive though .
Me : Yes , lovely .
Hope to see more of it .
You : Right , well .
Keep up the good work .
Me : Thanks .
( exit )
End of story .
Compare this to .
You : I know you probably get really annoyed by people coming up to you .
Me : No , no .
Not at all .
You :
No , it must be really irritating .
Me : Oh , well .
Goes with the job …
You :
You probably just want to be left alone .
Me : Well , you know … You :
What makes people bother you all the time ?
Do n’t they know you ’ve got the right to a private life ?
Me : Mm . You : Makes you sick .
Love your work , by the way .
Me : Thank you .
You : I ’m not like some mad fan , you know , but I used to watch that a Bit of Hugh and Laurie … and that IQ thing you do .
Me : … QI … You : Right .
That Alan Davies , what ’s he like ?
No , really .
What ’s he like ?
Me :
He ’s very nice .
You : Yeah , but is he that stupid ?
Me :
He ’s not stupid at all .
You :
No but he is , is n’t he ?
Me : No , no , not at all .
Quite the reverse .
You : Right , thought so .
Do you remember your parents used to shop at a delicatessen in Norwich called Lambert ’s ?
Me : Er … yes , that rings a bell .
You :
My girlfriend ’s mum had a friend who worked there .
Me : Gosh , really ?
You : Amazing , is n’t it ?
Me : Astounding .
Look , I really must …
You : Do you know what C. S. Lewis ’s middle name was ?
Me : Er , Staples I think .
You : Oh .
Someone must have told you that .
Me : Well , yes , a biography of C. S. Lewis .
You : Most people do n’t know that .
Me : Do n’t they ?
Well , well .
Gosh , I must be …
You : Must be very annoying having people just come up to you .
Do n’t know how you put up with it … have you got a pen ?
Me : Excuse me ?
You :
Or a piece of paper ?
Tell you what , can you sign this pack of biscuits .
Oi , darling , lend us a pen , see who I ’m talking to ? … Etc .
Compliments
The entire interaction works better if there ’s a little understanding on each side .
You might be the fortieth person that day to approach your sleb .
They might have just heard that their favourite aunt has been diagnosed with cancer .
On the other hand , the famous person should remember that it takes courage to approach a stranger , especially one you ’ve only seen on TV or at the movies .
They could so easily squash you .
Many newly made slebs fall down especially in the area of compliments .
It ’s perhaps a very English thing to find it hard to accept kind words about oneself .
If anyone praised me in my early days as a comedy performer I would say , “ Oh , nonsense .
Shut up .
No really , I was dreadful . ”
I remember going through this red-faced shuffle in the presence of the mighty John Cleese who upbraided me the moment we were alone .
‘ You genuinely think you ’re being polite and modest , do n’t you ? ’
‘ Well , you know …’ ‘ Do n’t you see that when someone hears their compliments contradicted they naturally assume that you must think them a fool ?
Suppose you went up to a pianist after a recital and told him how much you had enjoyed his performance and he replied , “ rubbish , I was awful ! ”
You would go away thinking you were a poor judge of musicianship and that he thought you an idiot . ’
‘ Yes , but I ca n’t agree with someone if they praise me , that would sound so cocky .
And anyway , suppose I do think I was awful ? ’ ( which most of the time performers do think of themselves , of course . )
‘ It ’s so simple .
You just say thank you .
You just thank them .
How hard is that ?’
You must think me the completest kind of arse to have needed to be told how to take a compliment , but it was an important lesson that I ( clearly ) never forgot .
So bound up with not wanting to look smug and pleased with ourselves are we that we forget how mortifying it is to have compliments thrown back in one ’s face .
Cameras !!
When I wrote my first couple of books back in the late eighties , I found one of the most enjoyable aspects of being an author was the Event .
This is publisher - speak for appearances in bookshops , talks , readings , lectures , literary festival on - stage interviews , plenary sessions , symposia and other such author - related public appearances .
Each event would end with a signing .
The queue would shuffle along , each customer would plonk a book down in front of me , we ’d shoot the breeze for a while , author and reader in merry harmony , then they ’d biff off to be replaced by the next in line .
All very pleasant and genial .
Occasionally , just every now and then , someone in the queue would have a camera and there would follow a rather complicated and painful procedure : the one with the camera , A , would have to find someone , B , willing to take a picture .
Sometimes B would be the next person in the queue , often a member of the bookshop ’s staff .
B would be given the camera , while A would go behind the signing table to put an arm round me or a hand on my shoulder as I signed the book with a flourish while looking up into the lens with grinning soupily .
Of course B would n’t be acquainted with A ’s particular make of camera .
In fact B would give the impression of never having taken a picture before in his or her life .
Wrong buttons would be pressed , extra shots would be taken ‘ just to be sure ’ .
The flash would fail to go off .
A would have to go round the table again to twiddle with knobs and eventually , after much delay the business would be done .
It was n’t too disastrous , at most one or two people in the whole signing queue would be armed a camera .
It was n’t too awful an imposition .
But today …
Today everyone has a camera .
They have a dedicated digital machine or something built into their mobile phone .
As a result of this ubiquity the signing queue has become such a living hell that I do n’t do them any more .
All the pleasure has been sucked out .
No agreeable exchanges and chats with the readers , nothing but the unspeakable horror of having to put up with 200 hundred versions of the awkward and excruciating performance described above .
The agony is especially exquisite given that the type of people who attend literary events and are interested in my books are precisely the type least competent at operating other people ’s cameras .
They may be able to use their own , but that ’s of no importance because the crucial prize ( which has all the point , purpose and value of twitching or train - spotting ) is for the camera owner to be in the picture with the poor sap of an author .
Given that the one thing that actors , writers and performers most hate ( and I ’m an extreme example ) is having their photograph taken , life has now become a kind of living hell .
It ’s bad enough with professional photographers in studios ( and believe me , it really is bad enough , I loathe the experience ) , but to have to freeze the face into something akin to a smile time after time after time while the bewildered operator footles uselessly about with the tiny little tits hat pass for buttons and switches .
The photo software is so diabolically crap on most phones anyway ( I have to say the Apple iPhone is astoundingly good in this respect , even a literary woman could operate it , and it is better quality than cameras with twice the pixel count ) that you can hardly blame people for not being able to use it .
It ’s hardly surprising they switch it off every time they mean to shoot , or that the screen goes black or it ’s in video mode or some other problem .
It ’s hardly surprising because as a piece of kit it ’s bollocks .
In the meantime the frozen smile fades , the queue behind gets restive and all the good vibes turn to bad .
But it does n’t end there …
The camera and all its horrors are by no means confined to the literary events which one can ( as I now do ) decide to leave well alone .
The fact is everybody has a camera whatever the time of day or night .
So you can almost forget everything I wrote above about people ’s conversational gambits , because a conversation is a rarity these days .
Today it ’s the crushing embarrassment of standing in the street like a gibbon while a total stranger accosts other total strangers and asks them to take a photograph .
Crowds gather , what could have been a quick anonymous chat has become a full - on photo - op .
‘ Me too ! ’
‘ Hold still ! ’
‘ Oh , and can you do a General Melchett “ Baaah ! ” so I can use it as a ring tone ?
Hang on , where ’s the recording app ? ’
‘ Say hello to my girlfriend , she does n’t believe I ’m talking to you . ’
‘ Could you say in a Jeeves voice , “ this is Kevin ’s phone , the master is out so would you please be kind enough to leave a message ? ” Blinder !’ etc .
Oh , bring back the days of the simple autograph .
Your Friends
If I were to ask one thing of people in their interaction with the famous it is this : consider the companions .
Imagine what it is like to be in the company of a well - known person , a person who could be your brother , sister , mother , life - partner , school - friend , client , patient .
You ’re chatting away and someone barges in on your conversation .
They completely ignore you , indeed often literally elbow you out of the way , planting their back in your face .
You patiently stare into your soup and watch as your famous friend / lover deals with them charmingly and eventually manages to end the exchange .
Who has suffered most ?
The famous person ?
No , he or she knows perfectly well how to deal with this , has accustomed themselves to these encounters and is , after all , usually the beneficiary , is made to feel important .
But the companion !
They are made to feel the opposite of important .
They are at best ignored and at worst resented for taking up the time and conversation of the famous person in the first place .
“ Who do you think you are , dining with them as if you owned them ? ”
It is awful , awful , awful having to accompany a well - known person in public .
On the first few occasions it might be instructive and interesting to a student of social anthropology , but in the end it ’s a pain , a real pain .
So if you ever do go up to someone well known , consider that point .
Watching fame happen I have grown well - known in my own land , and slightly known in other lands , and I have watched others grow very well known indeed .
When I made Wilde in 1996 I was much better known that my co-star Jude Law who is now internationally famous as a film star in a way I will never be .
When I directed James Mcavoy and David Tennant in Bright Young
Things they were complete newcomers .
I am proud , if that does n’t sound possessive , of the splendid way they have dealt with their very fast leap up the ladder of fame .
They have the advantage of very considerable talent , of course .
To be famous and talentless , that is the curse .
If you are rich and feel uncomfortable with the money , you can give it away in one stroke .
To lose your fame takes time .
The plus side
How graceless I sound , listing all these negatives .
Do forgive me .
I completely understand that to be well - known is to be blessed with all kinds of advantages .
I completely understand that fame is something that many , if not all , hunt after in their lives .
I know that fame usually suggests the accompaniment of money , admiration , opportunity , an easy acquaintanceship with interesting and extraordinary people , tickets to hot events , freebies and all the rest of it .
I know that some people value all these things above rubies and that they yearn for fame and its accoutrements more than they yearn for the talent or achievement that might bring them in the first place .
Nothing I can say about fame ’s drawbacks ( and we have n’t even started on what harm fame may or may not do to one ’s soul ) will sound anything other than curmudgeonly and ungrateful to many people reading this .
Which is why no one usually talks about the experience of fame at all .
It ’s best to shut up about it .
Plenty of people talk about “ the celebrity culture ” but very few discuss fame itself as an experience .
If there are a few wasps at the fame picnic – paparazzi , mean people , those determined to misunderstand you , those who embarrass you , stalk you , plague you – it is still a picnic and it does n’t do to moan .
I hope you ’ll understand that nothing I ’ve written so far is a moan : just a few observations I thought it worth sharing .
I ’ll be misunderstood , misinterpreted , of course I will .
That ’s another of the wasps .
But the pork pies , chicken leg and white wine still make the whole fete champetre entirely worth while .

Yes we do hold comments to be moderated , Producers .
PARIS ( Reuters ) - A junior computer whiz at French bank Societe Generale was accused of racking up a $ 7 billion loss in bad bets on stocks in the biggest trading scandal in banking history .
France ’s central bank and government scrambled to shore up confidence in the banking system after the 144 - year - old SocGen told investors already battered by the credit crisis that it discovered the “ exceptional ” fraud late last week .
The trader had circumvented the bank ’s risk controls through in - depth knowledge of its computer systems , but was caught when he tried to cover up his losses .
The country ’s central bank chief dubbed the trader “ a genius of fraud ” while French police announced a criminal probe .
Richard Fuld , the chief of Wall Street firm Lehman Brothers , called the debacle “ everyone ’s worst nightmare ” at the meeting of policy and business leaders in Davos .
The losses spiraled to 4.9 billion euros ( $ 7.1 billion ) -- nearly its net profit in 2006 -- as the bank tried to close out the rogue trader ’s stock index futures positions in Monday ’s sliding market .
“ We get the feeling that the financial markets have become a big casino which has lost control .
It seems incredible that the Societe Generale can lose 5 billion through one operator , ” said Alain Crouzat , a portfolio manager at Montsegur Finance .
SocGen declined to identify the trader , but three SocGen sources named him as Jerome Kerviel , 31 , a trader on the bank ’s award - winning equity derivatives desk earning less than 100,000 euros a year .
A head shot of Kerviel cut from a trading Web site showed an earnest - looking young man .
When his identity was revealed in the afternoon , he had 11 friends listed on the facebook .com social Web site .
That number later dropped to four .
Kerviel was not available for comment .
“ He is not running away .
He is at the disposal of the police , ” said Elisabeth Meyer , a woman who claimed to be his lawyer , on French TV .
The loss ranks as the biggest caused by a single trader , dwarfing the $ 1.4 billion loss by trader Nick Leeson that broke British bank Barings , and the $ 2.6 billion Sumitomo Corp lost in rogue copper trades in the 1990s .
It also eclipses a $ 6 billion - plus loss racked up by hedge fund Amaranth trader Brian Hunter and his team ahead of the fund ’s collapse in 2006 .
A SHOCKER
News of the fraud hit the company ’s Manhattan office like a bombshell , said a SocGen banker who did n’t want his name used .
“ It makes us look incompetent , which is n’t the case , ” the banker told Reuters .
“ We ’re all wondering if this fraud will wreck the company . ”
Societe Generale Chairman Daniel Bouton offered to resign but was asked to stay on by the board .
Shares in SocGen , which has a market capitalization of about 36 billion euros , fell more than 4 percent to 75.81 euros .
Traders said the shares were cushioned from further falls after the French financial establishment moved quickly to shore up SocGen ’s shattered capital .
Instead of beating a path to cash - rich sovereign wealth funds , as some U.S. banks have done during the recent credit slump , SocGen announced a capital increase of 5.5 billion euros and said this had already been underwritten by other banks .
France ’s prime minister reassured investors that SocGen ’s woes were isolated from the malaise sweeping global financial markets after a meltdown in U.S. sub -prime credit markets .
“ It is a serious case , but at the same time it has nothing to do with the situation on the financial markets , ” Francois Fillon , speaking in Davos , Switzerland .

In addition to the fraud , however , SocGen unveiled a further write - down of 2.05 billion euros related to the credit crunch .
Some investors wondered whether the bank ’s maneuvers had contributed to that day ’s global markets fall , and to the U.S. Federal Reserve ’s decision to cut interest rates .
The Federal Reserve said Thursday it had not been aware of SocGen ’s problems when it decided on a emergency 75 basis point cut this week .
‘ GENIUS OF FRAUD ’
One of France ’s oldest banks but a world leader in free - wheeling modern financial derivatives , SocGen said the losses came to light over the weekend when it found that the junior trader had tried to cover up bad bets on the stock market .
Slideshow ( 8 images )
The Bank of France launched an investigation into the trades .
The central bank ’s governor , Christian Noyer , said SocGen had been able to overcome the crisis because it was solid .
“ Today we have seen that there was a glitch in the system that was exploited by someone who I think got round five successive risk control systems so who was without doubt a genius of fraud , ” Noyer said .
The announcement sent a shiver through the world banking industry , which is suffering from the credit crunch as high - risk U.S. mortgage borrowers default on their loans .
SocGen accused the trader of taking “ massive fraudulent ” positions in 2007 and 2008 on European equity market indexes , meaning he was gambling on broad movements in share prices .
When the bank discovered the hidden trades on January 19 - 20 , it decided to close the positions in the market quickly .
But this coincided with a market rout , and the bank ended up nursing losses of 4.9 billion euros .
The trader has been suspended and faces a formal firing and a legal complaint from Societe Generale , which is in turn already being sued by a group of 100 angry shareholders .
Like Leeson before him , the trader apparently benefited from knowledge of the bank ’s control systems after working in the back office of its trading rooms , according to SocGen .
It said he had used a “ scheme of elaborate fictitious transactions ” to try to cover up his mistakes , but did not accuse him of profiting personally from his actions .
“ He was not one of our stars , ” said a senior board member .
Others said the crisis at SocGen , one of the top 10 banks in the eurozone by market value , could spell trouble elsewhere .
“ The most serious thing is that this puts into doubt the risk - management systems at some banks , ” said Fortis analyst Carlos Garcia .
Analysts said the episode would have a major impact on the reputation of SocGen , which was founded in 1864 .
Several said the bank , which has for years been coveted by larger French rival BNP Paribas SA , could face a battle to remain independent .
Eye - Fi has just announced the release of their new wireless SD memory card for digital cameras .
The card , which they have been beta testing over the last year and a half , connects your local wi-fi network and automatically uploads photos stored on the card to your computer or to one of 17 online photo sharing services and social networks .
The 2GB SD card is now available and is priced at $ 99.99 .
Eye - Fi uses home wireless networks to eliminate the time - consuming chore of dealing with cables , card readers or software plug-ins associated with uploading photos .
Users simply turn on their digital camera and their pictures are wirelessly uploaded .
The Eye - Fi Card works with existing and new SD - compatible digital cameras and stores photos like a conventional SD memory card .
Last year I met with Eye - Fi CEO Yuval Koren who showed me an early prototype of their wireless SD card and I participated in their early beta program .
Here ’s more coverage from Technology Review & Gizmodo .
Mr. Spitzer , who is married with three daughters , appeared briefly with his wife at his Manhattan office on Monday to apologize , but did not specifically address any involvement with the ring .
He said he needed to repair his relationship with his family and decide what was best for the state , but he declined to take questions , leaving after barely a minute .
“ I have acted in a way that violates my obligations to my family and violates my , or any , sense of right and wrong , ” the governor said .
“ I apologize first and most importantly to my family .
I apologize to the public to whom I promised better . ”
“ I have disappointed and failed to live up to the standard I expected of myself .
I must now dedicate some time to regain the trust of my family . ”
The governor then returned to his apartment on Fifth Avenue , where news vans and police cars clogged traffic .
Mr. Spitzer did not emerge overnight and did not appear early Tuesday for his regular morning jog .
Image Eliot Spitzer left his Manhattan apartment with his wife , Silda , on Monday .
He returned home after a brief statement and was said to be consulting with advisers .
Credit ... Tyler Hicks / The New York Times
The New York Times began investigating Mr. Spitzer ’s possible involvement with a prostitution ring on Friday , the day after the prosecutors arrested the four people on charges of helping run the Emperor ’s Club .
After inquiries from The Times over the weekend and on Monday , the governor canceled his public schedule .
An hour after The Times published a report on its Web site saying Mr. Spitzer had been linked to the ring , the governor made his statement .
Mr. Spitzer has not been charged with a crime .
But one law enforcement official who has been briefed on the case said that Mr. Spitzer ’s lawyers would probably meet soon with federal prosecutors to discuss any possible legal exposure .
The official said the discussions were likely to focus not on prostitution , but on how it was paid for :
Whether the payments from Mr. Spitzer to the service were made in a way to conceal their purpose and source .
That could amount to a crime called structuring , which carries a penalty of up to five years in prison .
Smart Moves To Lower Your Health Care Costs
You want to keep fit and stay healthy , but are you making smart moves to lower your health care costs ?
I had something going on for a while — some chronic health issues that bugged me .
I ’ve seen the round of specialists and no cigar .
They could n’t help me .
I looked to relieve strange health symptoms I ’d been experiencing that have stumped the regular medical community I ’ve consulted with .
The symptoms were strange only in the sense that they are n’t standard symptoms that point to any one classic malady , so nobody , in the span of two years , could really provide me with a reasonable diagnosis that I could go home and worry over .
So I turned to homeopathic treatment to try to get myself more “ balanced ” and hopefully get my old self back .
And here ’s the good news : homeopathic and alternative treatments have worked , and together with lifestyle changes , have banished my discomforts .
It turns out that “ stress ” must ’ve triggered the problems I ’ve been having and I ’m in much better shape now .
But the point of this story was for me to discuss the financial implications of going to an alternative doctor .
I ’m not sure what most people think , but my experience with traditional medicine has n’t been all too satisfactory .
From dealing with painful insurance issues , to frustrating visits with a revolving door of specialists , to terribly high out of pocket costs , this experience has been both a time and money pit for me .
As it is , the costs of medical care are ridiculous ( especially in the United States ) , so the fact that it ’s the leading cost of bankruptcy is not a huge surprise to me .
Health problems are a double whammy as they suck to live with , and also suck your finances dry .
What ’s even more unfortunate is that many people who try alternative treatments are already at the end of their rope .
Despite that , these treatments are n’t covered by insurance because of their “ alternative ” or “ natural ” designation — not approved as “ real ” medical solutions .
But by golly if I was n’t going to find a way to make these easier on my pocket !
Enter… Uncle Sam ’s tax breaks .
The Tax Deductibility Of Health Care Costs
Since I itemize my tax deductions , I at first rejoiced when I heard from my homeopath that some of my out of pocket expenses on supplements , tests and prescribed treatments would be tax deductible .
She insisted on it , though I did n’t really believe it ; I ’ve argued this out with my tax guy in the past .
So I consulted with the tax expert yet again about this and other aspects of the tax code that relates to health care costs .
Here ’s a Q & A covering some health care tax issues I have at the moment ( I ’m not a tax expert , so please refer to your CPA , Enrolled Agent or tax software for actual advice ) :
Q : Can I deduct my prescriptions , medications or supplements ?
A : If you ’ve got a diagnosed condition and your pills or other medications are prescribed , your medications and even supplements are tax deductible under certain conditions ( you need to reach a certain limit for the costs ) .
But over - the - counter wo n’t count .
Q : What health care costs are really tax deductible ?
A : All your medical costs including out of pocket costs , co-pays , prescriptions that add up to more than 7.5 % of your annual income for the given tax year can be considered for tax deductibility .
The costs are deductible above that 7.5 % point .
For example , say your AGI is $ 80,000 and you have $ 10,000 of health costs .
Your Schedule A itemized deduction is limited to $ 4,000 ( $ 10,000 minus $ 6,000 , which is 7.5 % of your $ 80,000 AGI ) .
Q : Now that I ’m self - employed , how can I have my business pay for my health insurance ?
A : I ’m a sole proprietor and I found out I could get a tax break from having my business pay for my family ’s health insurance by using a “ healthcare reimbursement arrangement ( also known as a IRC Section 105 ( b ) plan ) ” .
There are some tricky points to this rule , but it ’s something I ’m exploring right now .
It could mean big tax savings !
Sole proprietors , partners in partnerships , and S corporation shareholder - employees can’t participate in HRAs .
But there ’s a loophole in the law : A sole proprietor ’s spouse can be covered .
And that coverage can include both the employee and the employee ’s family .
Even though the spouse - employee ’s family includes the sole proprietor !
Let ’s say that your family pays $ 9,000 a year for health insurance and another $ 9,000 for uncovered medical expenses .
Say a family member has an expensive long - term illness .
Or simply that you ’ve got teenagers with big orthodontia bills .
Because you ’re self - employed , you would get to use the $ 9,000 of health insurance costs as a business income tax deduction in most cases anyway .
( Self - employed individuals can write off medical insurance if their business is profitable . )
However , with an HRA , you ’ll also be able to use the $ 9,000 of health insurance costs as a self - employment tax deduction .
That saves you roughly $ 1350 annually .
In addition , you ’ll be able to fully deduct the other $ 9,000 of uncovered healthcare costs as both an income tax deduction and as a self - employment tax deduction .
This deductibility could easily save you another $ 1350 in self - employment taxes and then another $ 2250 in income taxes .
Total savings : $ 4950 annually .

But as I ’ve mentioned before , better to consult with the tax experts about your specific situation .
Other Ways To Lower Your Health Care Bills
It turns out that despite all the tax breaks that exist out there that try to “ ease the pain ” for those of us with big health bills and medical expenses , these palliatives are just not good enough .
So what CAN we do about this ?
Other than make enough noise and join the health care debate raging on in our country , I can only come up with some tips ( which I ’ve also covered at the Prosper blog ) that can hopefully help stave off the misfortune of dealing with ill health and painful health care costs :
# 1 Maintain your health .
# 2 Have enough savings for emergencies .
# 3 Be prepared and have insurance coverage .
# 4 Have a Plan B. Address your worst case scenarios .
Unfortunately , even performing health - restoring changes may not be entirely free , as witnessed by the fact that I quit my job to alleviate the stress I had been experiencing , which was duly identified as the major cause of my “ hard - to - diagnose ” afflictions .
I lost out on the money , but I ’ve hopefully gained more of my health , sanity and overall happiness back .
In the end , I had a choice to make — pay less for medication ( with requisite side effects ! ) covered by insurance to mask my symptoms , OR pay more — a lot more ( as I ’ve mentioned , the holistic approach is most likely NOT covered by insurance ) — for “ functional treatment ” that would attempt to find the root cause of problems , aiming to address these problems directly .
In some respects , this adds to some of the issues we have with health care in this country .
Do n’t get me wrong : I think traditional medicine is the way to go when you need surgery , are facing a life - threatening condition or have a clearly diagnosable problem .
But health care is not just about making symptoms go away , it ’s also about preventing disease and maintaining well - being .
Now I ’m not so sure that ’s the traditional medical community ’s forte , or even something in their financial interest , for that matter .
Something I ’m not looking forward to : as we grow older , we ’ll be having more and more experiences like this that remind us that health is one of those things that no amount of money may be able to restore once it ’s gone .
So always take care of yourselves !
Be healthy and prosper .

In a series of studies in the 1970s and ’ 80s , psychologists at the University of Washington put more than 300 students into a study room outfitted like a bar with mirrors , music and a stretch of polished pine .
The researchers served alcoholic drinks , most often icy vodka tonics , to some of the students and nonalcoholic ones , usually icy tonic water , to others .
The drinks looked and tasted the same , and the students typically drank five in an hour or two .
The studies found that people who thought they were drinking alcohol behaved exactly as aggressively , or as affectionately , or as merrily as they expected to when drunk .
“ No significant difference between those who got alcohol and those who did n’t , ” Alan Marlatt , the senior author , said .
“ Their behavior was totally determined by their expectations of how they would behave . ”
In a repeat of the session performed for a coming documentary , one participant insisted that she could not have been drinking because alcohol always made her flush .
“ We told her that , yes , in fact she was drinking it , ” Dr. Marlatt said .
“ She immediately flushed . ”
Somewhere between personal preferences and social custom , moreover , the peer group asserts itself .
In a recent study , public health researchers in New Zealand conducted extensive interviews with teenage girls in one of two cliques at a high school .
Both groups associated drinking with uninhibited behavior  and that is what they exhibited .
But one group considered being uninhibited to include making out , and the other considered it to include far more .
In their discussion , Dr. MacAndrew and Dr. Edgerton acknowledged that Western societies , and certainly the United States , send multiple signals on bingeing .
At times , the signals cross , as when movies show spring - break binging as sunburned , sexy fun , while health pronouncements make it look like an orgy of near - criminal behavior .
At other times , cultural expectations and personal preferences reinforce each other .
The hope that a wild session might “ reveal new things about myself ” or “ allow me to act completely out of character ” is widely echoed in literature , pop culture and drinking lore .
If the research is a guide , those hopes should be self - fulfilling at some level .
Unless , that is , the binge goes beyond any reasonable definition of excess .
Then the amount of tequila consumed matters very much  and poison is poison in any culture .
Today , the Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in the case of Heller v. District of Columbia , a suit brought by several D.C. citizens contending that the ban on the possession of operable firearms inside one 's home violates the Second Amendment .
The Circuit Court of Appeals for D.C. agreed and held the ban to be unconstitutional .
However it is decided , Heller is already historic .
For the first time in recent memory , the Supreme Court will consider the original meaning of a significant passage of the Constitution unencumbered by its own prior decisions .
The majority and dissenting opinions in this case will be taught in law schools for years to come .
Here 's a layman 's guide to the significance of the case :
- Heller will be decided on originalist grounds .
Among law professors , enforcing the original meaning of the Constitution is highly controversial .
Critics of originalism deny that we should be ruled by the " dead hand of the past . "
They prefer following Supreme Court precedents that may or may not be consistent with original meaning .
Any justice who today professes a commitment to originalism is branded a radical ; and all Supreme Court nominees are now grilled on their commitment to the doctrine of stare decisis .
But what are old precedents if not the " dead hand " of dead justices ?
Significantly , then , both sides in Heller are making only originalist arguments .
The challengers of the law contend that the original meaning of the Second Amendment protects an individual " right to keep and bear arms " that " shall not be infringed . "
In response , the District does not contend that this right is outmoded and that the Second Amendment should now be reinterpreted in light of changing social conditions .
Not at all .
It contends instead that , because the original intention of the Framers of the Second Amendment was to protect the continued existence of " a well regulated militia , " the right it protects was limited to the militia context .
So one thing is certain .
Whoever prevails , Heller will be an originalist decision .
This shows that originalism remains the proper method of identifying the meaning of the Constitution .
- The Second Amendment protects an individual right .
In the 1960s , gun control advocates dismissed the Second Amendment as protecting the so - called " collective right " of states to preserve their militias -- notwithstanding that , everywhere else in the Constitution , a " right " of " the people " refers to an individual right of persons , and the 10th Amendment expressly distinguishes between " the people " and " the states . "
Now even the District asserts the new theory that , while this right is individual , it is " conditioned " on a citizen being an active participant in an organized militia .
Therefore , whoever wins , Heller wo n't be based on a " collective " right of the states .
Is Obama Or Clinton The Better General Election Candidate ?
The extended battle between Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton raises numerous interesting questions :
Which candidate can better put the Democratic party back together for the general election ?
Is a nomination fight that could last all the way to the convention a negative or positive ?
Which is better going into the general election , the Clinton or Obama primary coalition ?
These questions and others have captured the imagination of many of those closely watching the contest .
Take , for example , William Frey , a Brookings Institution demographer .
On the assumption that the general election will ride on who wins the battleground states , the question then becomes , which are the battlegrounds ?
" In my mind , there are slow - growing battlegrounds , including much of the Great Lakes and Midwest ( e.g. Ohio , Michigan , Pennsylvania , among others ) and fast growing battlegrounds ( e.g. Nevada , Colorado , New Mexico , as well as Florida , among others ) , " Frey says .
If the fight comes down to the slow - growing states , " Hillary should have a strong advantage , because Obama 's post - boomer appeal will turn off the aging baby boomers and seniors who would be more likely to go for McCain than to someone much younger and hipper , not to mention non-white . "
Conversely , Frey argues , " Obama will have the advantage in the more diverse , fast growing battlegrounds .
Not only is he a self proclaimed post - baby - boomer , but in many respects , he leads the way toward a post- ethnic , post - partisan America , which is spreading out to these states . "
Frey suggested that " this election , like the last one , could depend on the ' old white belt ' of the slow growing battlegrounds , in which case Hillary would fare better in perhaps the last battle of aging white presidential candidates . "
Looking at the election on a state - by - state basis , Emory political scientist Alan Abramowitz came to a different conclusion :
" Obama does better in the western states .
She does better in the Northeast , but those states are almost certain to end up in the D column anyway .
So on balance , I 'd say he looks a little stronger because of his ability to generate higher turnout of some Democratic constituencies and his ability to turn some previously red states into battlegrounds : Virginia , North Carolina , Colorado , maybe even Texas . "
American Prospect contributing editor Adele Stan looked at the issue from the vantage point of completing constituencies , contending that the general election advantage falls to Obama :
" Barack Obama stands to inherit most of Hillary Clinton 's coalition , minus the party 's racists .
Clinton will likely lose more of the party 's sexists , plus its new contingent of young voters ( who may just stay home ) ...
Hillary 's strength is among white people over 50 ; Barack 's is among young people of all backgrounds .
McCain could cut into Hillary 's advantage with older whites , but is unlikely to get Obama 's young people .
So , I would say that the Obama coalition has a slight advantage over Clinton 's in the general .
Robert Borosage , co-chair of the Campaign for America 's Future , contended that Obama is the higher risk candidate , but he is also the candidate who could give the Democrats a major payout :
" Race is a powerful force in this society .
Obama has potential , in my view , to have far greater upside than Hillary -- you can imagine him creating a realignment , with young people , Latinos , independent professionals , etc. , joining working people in a new majority coalition .
But Republicans will turn him into an alien , and since folks have n't had a chance to know him , the risks of a real downside are greater also . "
The strongest case for Obama was voiced by a Republican , Alex Castellanos , who was a senior media consultant in both of George W. Bush 's campaigns and in Mitt Romney 's failed bid for the nomination .
" Obama is the hope and future of the Democratic Party , not Hillary , and everyone knows it .
He is the one bringing new energy and voters .
He could be a Democratic Reagan , invigorating the party for 25 years .
If the Clinton people knee - cap Obama , it would be like killing Santa Claus Xmas morning in front of the children .
The children wo n't forget or forgive . "
Castellanos warned , however , that Obama carries his own liabilities :
" He is a weaker , consensus leader , not a strong leader in an uncertain world .
Hillary is the past , polarizing , but a tough , strong leader in uncertain world .
In 50's America terms , it is role reversal :
It might be said that she is the tough , daddy bear candidate , and Obama is the weaker , consensus mommy bear candidate . "
The costs ( and benefits ) of the exceptionally long Democratic nomination fight are not easily agreed upon .
Author Katha Pollitt sees it as pretty much an unmitigated disaster :
" I think it is BAD for the Democrats for the fight to go on , because inevitably Hillary and Obama will have to do their best to tarnish each other in ways that will turn off less - committed voters and will give McCain ammunition .
HRC 's saying she and McCain were ready to be commander - in - chief but Obama has just given speeches is a good example . "
In contrast , Borosage contends that the length of the nomination fight " has been good thus far , getting the country accustomed to a black or woman at the head of ticket , getting both campaigns more ready for prime time .
" I think people overplay the negative effects of a nomination struggle .
This one has helped excite people , kept Democrats in the news , raised masses of new donors and activists etc .
Once over , both candidates have a stake in bringing party together .
And while activists are bruised , low information voters are just getting sense of what 's going on , and are not likely to be dismayed . "
While Borosage anticipates that the contest will soon " get more destructive , " he is sanguine about the detrimental consequences of some of the tough charges the candidates are throwing at each other .
" If Hillary 's peddling Moslem , black church , Farrakhan , inexperience , yada - yada now -- and Obama learns how to respond ( and how to talk to working people ) -- she 's not saying anything the Republicans wo n't say in far harsher terms . "
Castellanos , however , sees virtually no pluses on a long primary fight .
" Look at the land wars across Russia .
It did n't work out too well for Charles XII in 1707 , Napoleon in 1812 or Hitler in 1941 .
In each case , the long campaign was no " victory " since the great armies were obliterated on the way .
In each case near certain victory was turned into defeat by the length of the bloody campaign . "
Thomas B. Edsall is the political editor of the Huffington Post .
The United States has passed an historic and symbolic watershed in its unrelenting , two generations - long quest to incarcerate as many Blacks as humanly possible .
As of January 1 , more than one of every 100 adults is behind bars , about half of them Black .
That ’s not counting Afro-Latinos and other Hispanics .
The U.S. is the unchallenged leader in mass incarceration , with the largest Gulag on the planet , based on raw numbers of inmates – 2,319,258 in federal and state prisons and local jails – and per capita incarceration : 750 inmates for every 100,000 people .
Russia , which led the world back in Soviet times , is number two , with 628 inmates per 100,000 .
The Black and brown U.S. prisoner population , alone , roughly equals that of China ’s – a nation with four times the population of the U.S .
Russia ’s imprisonment practices grew out of the Tsarist Siberian and later , Stalinist model .
America ’s model is directly derived from slavery – the virtual imprisonment of an entire people .
From the post - Emancipation “ Black Codes ” through the 1960s , Blacks have always been locked up in vastly disproportionate numbers .
Still , white inmates were in the majority until at least 1964 .
Then , beginning in the early 70s , the prison population exploded , multiplying seven times .
By 1996 , African Americans comprised 53 percent of all persons admitted to state and federal prisons .
One out of nine Black males between the ages of 20 and 34 now resides behind bars , compared to just one of every 30 whites .
The debate over U.S. prison growth and wildly disparate Black incarceration – to the extent there is a debate – usually centers on draconian and racially - engineered drug sentences .
That ’s descriptive of one modality of prison growth , addressing the “ how ” of the problem , but does n’t address the “ why ” of it , the political intentions of massive imprisonment of African Americans .
Countless studies have shown beyond statistical doubt that the U.S. “ justice ” system is stacked against African Americans at every stage of the process : hyper-surveillance of Black neighborhoods , leading to disproportionate arrests , a nationwide pattern of prosecutorial fervor to charge Blacks with more serious crimes than white defendants , harsher sentences once convicted , and far fewer opportunities for Blacks to avoid hard time through “ diversion ” programs that are skewed to allowing far more whites to escape long term stints in prison .
Once again , these factors explain how Blacks have become majorities in prison , even in states and localities with relatively small Black populations , but do not address why Black mass incarceration began to accelerate at breakneck speed in the early 70s , and continues no matter whether crime is up or down .
“ Mass Black incarceration , ” I wrote in February , 2007 , ” is America ’s answer to the Black Freedom Movement of the Sixties and early Seventies . ”
Just as the “ Black Codes ” were the white South ’s response to Emancipation , and as massive incarceration of Black “ loiterers ” to prison plantations and chain gangs followed the crushing of Reconstruction , whites got revenge against the Black Freedom Movement of the Sixties by throwing as many as possible African Americans in prison .
This “ nigger - caging ” response was near - uniform across the country – North , South , East and West .
It is the Mother of All White Backlashes – no , the Grandmother , showing no signs of diminishing in racist fury after more than 30 years .
“ Reform ” measures are surely needed , such as elimination of mandatory sentencing , broader application of prison “ diversion ” programs , abolition of racist crack cocaine super - sentences , a requirement that “ racial impact ” studies be instituted at all prisons and jails , repeal of state laws depriving convicted felons of the right to vote , and many other proposals .
However , if mass Black incarceration , the “ engine ” of prison growth , is not understood as an ongoing , institutionalized crime whose purpose is wholly racial , the discussion will be limited to reformers who attempt to tinker around the edges of the historical catastrophe and Black clergy who think they can preach successive Black generations out of going to prison .
It is as if Nazis could be convinced to “ rehabilitate ” Jews rather than kill them .
The whole purpose of the death camp was to kill Jews .
The purpose of U.S. prisons is to socially erase masses of Blacks , to subject them to social death .
The demonic project has mutilated two generations of African American youth , and damaged Black America to its very core – just as was planned when masses of whites were traumatized in the 60s at the nightmare sight of Black men , women and youth standing tall , demanding full rights and recognition of their humanity .
OK , you can be human , if you insist , the mass incarcerators conceded , but it will have to be behind bars .
To effectively battle a system , one must understand its nature .
Those states that are attempting to slow or halt the growth of their prisons are doing so only because mass incarceration is becoming too expensive for public coffers to sustain , including the explosive growth of private prisons .
But the nature and purpose of the beast goes largely unchallenged .
Mass Equal Opportunity Lockups
The Pew Center on the States report on prisons was released one day after an ABC News story on the FBI ’s listing of nearly a million persons as “ terrorist threats . ”
The ACLU extrapolated the figure from the Department of Justice Inspector General ’s statement , last September , that FBI watch list then stood at 700,000 names , and growing at 20,000 names per month .
Again , one must understand the nature of the beast .
To believe that the FBI and the National Counterterrorism Center possess a lists of 900,000 genuine “ terror suspects , ” by name or alias , is absurd .
ABC concluded that “ it appears the FBI may be adding tens of thousands of names belonging to U.S. persons it suspects of being domestic terrorists — people who have no known ties to international terrorist organizations . ”
No doubt the feds have many hundreds of thousands of “ names , ” but it is impossible to accept that the U.S. government has identified almost a million people with actual ties to real terrorism , domestically or worldwide .
There are n’t that many on the planet , much less in U.S. “ sleeper ” cells .
The domestic names are clearly a list of people to be picked up .
These “ action lists ” are of people to be arrested when politically possible , whose politics is deemed suspect by the regime in power .
Will a Democratic administration order the lists destroyed ?
Not likely .
Reacting to the FBI ’s arrest of a group of Black Miami men for plotting to blow up the Sears Tower , in Chicago , Barack Obama said :
The men and women of the FBI have done a great job infiltrating and taking down this home - grown terrorist cell .
But this is a stark reminder that landmarks in our nation ’s great cities , like the Sears Tower in Chicago , remain tempting targets for terrorists and would - be terrorists .
The Liberty City Seven trial ended in a mistrial and one acquittal , broadly viewed as a farcical , Keystone FBI attempt at entrapping impoverished African American men who had no capacity to plan or carry out such an attack .
Those who ask only that the federal government shorten its purely political lists of “ terror ” suspects – actually , all the names of progressives they can get their hands on , for convenient mass arrest – refuse to acknowledge the nature of the beast .
The police state that has long existed in Black America may one day soon extend well beyond racial borders .
As a fellow geek , you may wholeheartedly agree with this article .
If you are a non -geek ( do they really exist ? ) , you might take offense .
Regardless … how you feel about the matter is largely irrelevant – the truth is that a geek probably will steal your girlfriend this year ( or steal away the girl you may have designs on ) , and while we hate to be the ones to break it to you , it ’s simply a friendly forewarning .
Without further ado , here are 12 reasons why a geek will steal your girlfriend this year :
1 . Geeks make more money than you .
Claiming that women value money over everything else is not going to fly .
Instead , you must consider the more practical angle – when all other things are considered equal , the guy with more money is simply the better option .
That raises two questions – do geeks have more money , and how does a geek match up at everything else ?
For the former , here ’s a thought :
Remember that pimply faced , awkward , AD&D player who everyone made fun of in high school ?
Chances are he has come up with the concept for the latest gadget the masses have been drooling over ( Steve Jobs with iPhone ) , a social networking site that has taken the world by storm ( Kevin Rose with Digg ) or created the coolest cartoon in history ( Trey Parker and Mark Stone with South Park ) .
The other question ?
That ’s a subject for the rest of this article .
2. Geeks are smarter than you .
They might not have a player ’s social skills and graces but they do hold degrees in anything from literature to nuclear physics .
And even those without a degree ( think Bill Gates ) can converse about more then how much they earn , what kind of car they drive and the latest football scores .
Stimulating conversation goes a long way towards winning her heart – and compared to the average guy , a geek has far more to talk about and is undeniably far more interesting .
3 . Geeks pay attention .
Men in general cannot multitask .
That is why when you are on a date , your eyes glaze over while you stare at woman ’s cleavage and all you hear is bla , bla , bla ( to be fair you ’re probably not missing much , but that ’s not the point here ) .
So how do geeks differ ?
It is not that geeks do not appreciate breasts ( they are men after all ) but what ’s almost universally common in geeks is the presence of old - fashioned chivalry and plain old good manners .
You ’d be surprised at how far that can get you with a girl ( as long as you do n’t roll over and play dead ) .
Given the choice between breasts and listening to the bla bla of their new lady friend , odds are that the geek will be discreet in his stares and learn to multitask ( see # 2 ) .
Hey , you ca n’t avoid great cleavage …
4 . Geeks remember what matters .
I ’m not talking about when the Chicago Bulls won the championship for the third time in a row or how many times Jessica Alba was in Maxim magazine .
Geeks have super powers – they can remember birthdays and anniversaries and all other little nuances women love so much .
In itself , having a good ( nay , excellent ) memory is just a regular trait ( and can be annoying if you feel the overwhelming urge to correct others ) , but combined with # 5 , it is an overwhelming advantage for the geek .
5 . Geeks pick out the best gifts .
Not only will geeks remember when it ’s her birthday , they will remember what her likes and dislikes ( and if she has n’t told him , see # 6 for the kicker ) .
With all this information at their disposal , geeks will also come up with perfect gift .
It really does take minimum effort , regardless of what men might think .
And let ’s face it : when was the last time you remembered your girlfriend ’s birthday in time , let alone found a gift that has made her squeal with delight ?
6 . Geeks put in the extra effort .
Missed her favorite show ?
Ca n’t find that obscure Indian movie her friends have been telling her about ?
Interested in a new underground band that could be the next big thing ?
Leave it to the geek to find it for her .
And if they have n’t been together for long , you can trust the geek to ask her the right questions and find out what she wants and does n’t want – and then give that to her .
You do n’t have to obey her every wish – giving her what she truly needs is often the key to a successful relationship , and not only are geeks ahead of the curve in finding out what she needs , but they ’re also ahead in terms of putting in the extra yards to ensure that she gets it .
7 . Geeks are better lovers .
Before you laugh …actually , go ahead , laugh this one out .
I ’ll wait .
Once you ’re done claiming your superiority , here ’s the harsh truth – men are , on average , unsatisfying .
Experience does n’t do much for a guy if all he ’s doing is trying to hold it in as long as possible – yea , practice makes perfect but you ’re only going to go so far when your limit is 3 minutes .
Notice that I did n’t say geeks were better endowed or lasted longer – but that geeks were better lovers .
Compared to an average guy , a geek is going to be better prepared , knows exactly how to please a lady in bed and will actually pay attention to her needs instead of trying to catch the early train back home .
8 . Geeks get the best gadgets .
Lets face it : diamonds and pearls went out fashion a while back .
Now it ’s all about the latest gadgets – iPods and smartphones , iConnect pillows and singing yoga mats .
And who has the finger on the pulse of what is hot and what is not in the electronics world ?
The geek of course .
Not only she will be hip and cool with her latest gadget , she ’ll also be the envy of her girlfriends .
And that , my non -geeks friends , holds one of the biggest secrets to a relationship – make a woman look good , and she will go through a lot of trouble ( like dumping her current boyfriend ) to be with you .
9 . Geeks will nurture the child within .
What man will not run screaming if she wants to play dress up , admire that doll in the window or suggests an outing to the latest amusement park ?
All these things are normal and accepted in a geek ’s world .
10 .
Geeks are the new handymen – except that they ’re good at what they do .
Geeks can upgrade , maintain , upload or fix anything that is plugged into a wall .
You want your computer to be fast as the speed of light , want the best sound system , TiVo playing , want your tea kettle to whistle a tune while brewing your coffee ?
Ok that last one might be an exaggeration , but you get my drift .
Anything technically related is something geeks can do and if it is not their area of expertise , they have friends who can handle it .
11 . Geeks are trustworthy
Trust is a funny thing .
If a guy is too loyal , he might be seen as clingy and just another burden .
If the same guy plays around and ca n’t keep his toungue in his mouth ( so to speak ) , it ’s going to magnify a lot of other problems that a girl would usually compromise over .
But if you get it right – if a girl can be secure in her relationship while retaining her freedom , she ’s going to be on the moon ( and that means more fun for the geek ) .
If she fancies a night out with the girls , she knows that her geek can be left unattended without any worries .
She knows that the geek is into her for more than just the sex , and is loyal to her ( ok , thats what she thinks , but you ca n’t fault us geeks for playing that card , can you ? ) .
Remove the source of a women ’s insecurity and she becomes a much more fun person to be with – as geeks know .
12 . Geeks are a refreshing and attractive change from the regular stock
They are caring .
They are NOT desperate for sex .
They love sports , but wo n’t lose sanity if their team loses .
And not only do they make the effort to take her out to a nice place , they also take her to places that she ’s probably never been ( all that research and attention comes in handy ) .
In short , geeks are unlike the majority of the men the girl will know in her life – in fact , they ’re probably much better than the guys she knows , at least according to how she rates guys .
If that ’s not an advantage , I do n’t know what is .

THE WORLD'S MOST DANGEROUS BOOK
by Alan Watts ( 1915 - 1973 )
For many centuries the Roman Catholic Church was opposed to translating the Holy Scriptures into the " vulgar tongue . ”
To this day , you can still get rid of a Bible salesman by saying , " But we are Catholics and , of course , do n’t read the Bible . ”
The Catholic hierarchy included subtle theologians and scholars who knew very well that such a difficult and diverse collection of ancient writings , taken as the literal Word of God , would be wildly and dangerously interpreted if put into the hands of ignorant and uneducated peasants .
Likewise , when a missionary boasted to George Bernard Shaw of the numerous converts he had made , Shaw asked , " Can these people use rifles ? ”
" Oh , indeed , yes , ” said the missionary .
" Some of them are very good shots . ”
Whereupon
Shaw scolded him for putting us all in peril in the day when those converts waged holy war against us for not following the Bible in the literal sense they gave to it .
For the Bible says , " What a good thing it is when the Lord putteth into the hands of the righteous invincible might . ”
But today , especially in the United States , there is a taboo against admitting that there are enormous numbers of stupid and ignorant people , in the bookish and literal sense of these words .
They may be highly intelligent in the arts of farming , manufacture , engineering and finance , and even in physics , chemistry or medicine .
But this intelligence does not automatically flow over to the fields of history , archaeology , linguistics , theology , philosophy and mythology which are what one needs to know in order to make any sense out such archaic literature as the books of the Bible .
This may sound snobbish , for there is an assumption that , in the Bible , God gave His message in plain words for plain people .
Once , when I had given a radio broadcast in Canada , the announcer took me aside and said , " Do n’t you think that if there is a truly loving God , He would given us a plain and specific guide as to how to live our lives ? ”
" On the contrary , " I replied , " a truly loving God would not stultify our minds .
He would encourage us to think for ourselves . "
I tried , then , to show him that his belief in the divine authority of the Bible rested on nothing more than his own personal opinion , to which , of course , he was entitled .
This is basic .
The authority of the Bible , the church , the state , or of any spiritual or political leader , is derived from the individual followers and believers , since it is the believers ’ judgment that such leaders and institutions speak with a greater wisdom than there own .
This is , obviously , a paradox , for only the wise can recognize wisdom .
Thus , Catholics criticize Protestants for following their own opinions in understanding the Bible , as distinct from the interpretations of the Church , which originally issued and authorized the Bible .
But Catholics seldom realize that the authority of the Church rests , likewise , on the opinion of its individual members that the Papacy and the councils of the Church are authoritative .
The same is true of the state , for , as a French statesman said , people get the government they deserve .
Why does one come to the opinion that the Bible , literally understood , is the truth , the whole truth , and nothing but the truth ?
Usually because one ’s " elders and betters , " or an impressively large group of ones peers , have this opinion .
But this is to go along with the Bandar - log , or monkey tribe , in Rudyard Kipling ’s Jungle Books , who periodically get together and shout , " We all say so , so it must be true ! "
Having been a grandfather for a number of years , I am not particularly impressed with patriarchal authority .
I am of an age with my own formerly impressive grandfathers ( one of whom was a fervent fundamentalist , or literal believer in the Bible ) and I realize that my opinions are as fallible as theirs .
But many people never grow up .
They stay all their lives with a passionate need for eternal authority and guidance , pretending not to trust their own judgment .
Nevertheless , it is their own judgment , willy - nilly , that there exists some authority greater than their own .
The fervent fundamentalist whether Protestant or Catholic , Jew or Moslem is closed to reason and even communication for fear of losing the security of childish dependence .
He would suffer extreme emotional heebie jeebies if he did n’t have the feeling that there was some external and infallible guide in which he could trust absolutely and without which his very identity would dissolve .
This attitude is not faith .
It is pure idolatry .
The more deceptive idols are not images of wood and stone but are constructed of words and ideas and mental images of God .
Faith is an openness and trusting attitude to truth and reality , whatever it may turn out to be .
This is a risky and adventurous state of mind .
Belief , in the religious sense , is the opposite of faith because it is a fervent wishing or hope , a compulsive clinging to the idea that the universe is arranged and governed in such and such a way .
Belief is holding to a rock ; faith is learning how to swim and this whole universe swims in boundless space .
Thus , in much of the English - speaking world , the King James Bible is a rigid idol , all the more deceptive for being translated into the most melodious English and for being an anthology of ancient literature that contains sublime wisdom along with barbaric histories and the war songs of tribes on the rampage .
All this is taken as the literal Word and counsel of God , as it is by fundamentalist Baptists , Jesus freaks , Jehovah ’s Witnesses and comparable sects , which by and large know nothing of the history of the Bible , of how it was edited and put together .
So we have with us the social menace of a huge population of intellectually and morally irresponsible people .
Take a ruler and measure the listings under " Churches " in the Yellow Pages of the phone directory .
You will find that the fundamentalists have by far the most space .
And under what pressure do most hotels and motels place Gideon Bibles by the bedside Bibles with clearly fundamentalist introductory material , taking their name Gideon from one of the more ferocious military leaders of the ancient Israelites ?
As is well known , the enormous political power of fundamentalists is what makes legislators afraid to take laws against victimless " sins " and crimes off the books , and what corrupts the police by forcing them to be armed preachers enforcing ecclesiastical laws in a country where church and state are supposed to be separate ignoring the basic Christian doctrine that no actions , or abstentions from actions , are of moral import unless undertaken voluntarily .
Freedom is risky and includes the risk that anyone may go to hell in his own way .
Now , the King James Bible did not , as one might gather from listening to fundamentalists , descend with an Angel from heaven A.D. 1611 , when it was first published .
It was an elegant , but often inaccurate , translation of Hebrew and Greek documents composed between 900 B.C. and A.D. 120 .
There is no manuscript of the Old Testament , that is , of the Hebrew Scriptures , written in Hebrew , earlier than the Ninth Century B.C.
But we know that these documents were first put together and recognized as the Holy Scriptures by a convention of rabbis held at Jamnia ( Yavne ) in Palestine shortly before A.D. 100 .
On their say - so .
Likewise , the composition of the Christian Bible , which documents to include and which to drop , was decided by a council of the Catholic Church held in Carthage in the latter part of the Fourth Century .
Several books that had formerly been read in the churches , such as the Shepherd of Hermas and the marvelous Gospel of Saint Thomas , were then excluded .
The point is that the books translated in the King James Bible were declared canonical and divinely inspired by the authority ( A ) of the Synod of Jamnia and ( B ) of the Catholic Church , meeting in Carthage more than 300 years after the time of Jesus .
It is thus that fundamentalist Protestants get the authority of their Bible from Jews who had rejected Jesus and from Catholics whom they abominate as the Scarlet Woman mentioned in Revelation .
The Bible , to repeat , is an anthology of Hebrew and late Greek literature , edited and put forth by a council of Catholic bishops who believed that they were acting under the direction of the Holy Spirit .
Before this time the Bible as we know it did not exist .
There were the Hebrew Scriptures and their translated into Greek the Septuagint , which was made in Alexandria between 250 B.C. and 100 B.C.
There were also various codices , or Greek manuscripts , of various parts of the New Testament , such as the four Gospels .
There were numerous other writings circulating among Christians , including the Epistles of Saint Paul and Saint John , the Apocalypse ( Revelation ) and such documents ( later excluded ) as the Acts of John , the Didache , the Apostolic Constitutions and the various Epistles of Clement , Ignatius and Polycarp .
In those days , and until the Protestant Reformation in the 16th Century , the Scriptures were not understood exclusively in a narrow literal sense .
From Clement of Alexandria ( Second Century ) to Saint Thomas Aquinas ( 13th Century ) , the great theologians , or Fathers of the Church , recognized four ways of interpreting the Scriptures : the literal or historical , the moral , the allegorical and the spiritual and they were overwhelmingly interested in the last three .
Origen ( Second Century ) regarded much of the Old Testament as " puerile " if taken literally , and Jewish theologians were likewise preoccupied with finding hidden meanings in the Scriptures , for the concern of all these theologians was to interpret the Biblical texts in such a way as to make the Bible intellectually respectable and philosophically interesting .
Concern over the historical truth of the Bible is relatively modern , whether in the form of fundamentalism or of scientific research .
But when the Bible was translated and widely distributed as a result of the invention of printing , it fell into the hands of people who , like the Jesus freaks of today , were simply uneducated and who , as the depressed classes of Europe , eventually swarmed over to America .
This is , naturally , a heroic generalization .
There were , and are , fundamentalists learned in languages and sciences ( although the standard translation of the Bible into Chinese is said to be in fearful taste ) , just as there are professors of physics and anthropology who somehow manage to be pious Mormons .
Some people have the peculiar ability to divide their minds into watertight compartments , being critical and rational in matters of science but credulous as children when it comes to religion .
Such superstition would have been relatively harmless if the religion had been something tolerant and pacific , such as Taoism or Buddhism .
But the religion of the literally understood Bible is chauvinistic and militant .
It is on the march to conquer the world and to establish itself as the one and only true belief .
Among its most popular hymns are such battle songs as " Mine eyes have seen the glory " and Onward , Christian Soldiers .
The God of the Hebrews , the Arabs and the Christians is a mental idol fashioned in the image of the great monarchs of Egypt , Chaldea and Persia .
It was possibly Ikhnaton ( Amenhotep IV , 14th Century B.C. ) , Pharaoh of Egypt , who gave Moses the idea of monotheism ( as suggested in Freud ’s Moses and Monotheism ) .
Certainly the veneration of God as " King of kings and Lord of lords " borrows the official title of the Persian emperors .
Thus , the political pattern of tyranny , beneficent or otherwise , of rule by violence , whether physical or moral , stands firmly behind the Biblical idea of Jehovah .
When one considers the architecture and ritual of churches , whether Catholic or Protestant , it is obvious until most recent times that they are based on royal or judicial courts .
A monarch who rules by force sits in the central court of his donjon with his back to the wall , flanked by guards , and those who come to petition him for justice or to offer tribute must kneel or prostrate themselves simply because these are difficult positions from which to start a fight .
Such monarchs are , of course , frightened of their subjects and constantly on the anxious alert for rebellion .
Is this an appropriate image for the inconceivable energy that underlies the universe ?
True , the altar - throne in Catholic churches is occupied by the image of God in the form of one crucified as a common thief , but he hangs there as our leader in subjection to the Almighty Father , King of the universe , propitiating Him for those who have broken
His not always reasonable laws .
And what of the curious resemblances between Protestant churches and courts of law ?
The minister and the judge wear the same black robe and " throw the book " at those assembled in pews and various kinds of boxes , and both ministers and judges have chairs of estate that are still , in effect , thrones .
The crucial question , then , is that if you picture the universe as a monarchy , how can you believe that a republic is the best form of government , and so be a loyal citizen of the United States ?
It is thus that fundamentalists veer to the extreme right wing in politics , being of the personality type that demands strong external and paternalistic authority .
Their " rugged individualism " and their racism are founded on the conviction that they are the elect of God the Father , and their forebears took possession of America as the armies of Joshua took possession of Canaan , treating the Indians as Joshua and Gideon treated the Bedouin of Palestine .
In the same spirit the Protestant British , Dutch and Germans took possession of Africa , India and Indonesia , and the rigid Catholics of Spain and Portugal colonized Latin America .
Such territorial expansion may or may not be practical politics , but to do it in the name of Jesus of Nazareth is an outrage .
The Bible is a dangerous book , though by no means an evil one .
It depends , largely , on how you read it with what prejudices and with what intellectual background .
Regarded as sacred and authoritative , such a complex collection of histories , legends , allegories and images becomes a monstrous Rorschach blot in which you can picture almost anything you want to discover just as one can see cities and mountains in the clouds or faces in the fire .
Fundamentalists " prove " the truth of the Bible by trying to show how the words of the prophets have foretold events that have come to pass in relatively recent times .
But any statistician knows that you can find correlations , if you want to , between almost any two sets of patterns or rhythms between the occurrence of sunspots and fluctuations of the stock market , between the lines and bumps on your hand and the course of your life or between the architecture of the Great Pyramid and the history of Europe .
This is because of eidetic vision , or the brain ’s ability to project visions and forms of its own into any material whatsoever .
But scholars of ancient history find the remarks of the prophets entirely relevant to events of their own time , in the ancient Near East .
The Biblical prophets were not so much predictors as social commentators .
I am not in the position of those liberal Christians who reject fundamentalism but must still insist that Jesus was the one and only incarnation of God , or at least the most perfect human being .
No one is intellectually free who feels that he cannot and must not disagree with Jesus and is therefore forced into the dishonest practice of wangling the words of the Gospels to fit his own opinions .
There is not a scrap of evidence that Jesus was familiar with any other religious tradition than that of the Hebrew Scriptures or that he knew anything of the civilizations of India , China or Peru .
Under these circumstances , he was faced with the virtually impossible problem of expressing himself in the peculiar religious language and imagery of his local culture .
For it is obvious to any student of the psychology of religion that what he needed to express was the relatively common change of consciousness known as mystical experience the vivid and overwhelming sensation that your own being is one with eternal and ultimate reality .
But it was as hard for Jesus to say this as it still is for a native of the American Bible Belt .
It implies the blasphemous , subversive and lunatic claim to be identical with the all - knowing and allruling monarch of the world its Pharaoh or Cyrus .
Jesus would have had no trouble in India , for this experience is the foundation of Hinduism , and the Hindus recognize many people in both ancient and modern times as embodiments of the divine , or sons of God but not , of course , of the kind of God represented by Jehovah .
Buddhists , likewise , teach that anyone can , and finally will , become a Buddha ( an Enlightened One ) , in the same way as the historic Gautama .
If the Gospel of Saint John , in particular , is to be believed , Jesus emphatically identified himself with the Godhead , considering such phrases as " I and the Father are one , " or " He who has seen me has seen the Father , " or " Before Abraham was , I am , " or " I am the way , the truth and the life . "
But this was not an exclusive claim for himself as the man Jesus , for at John 10:31 , just after he has said " I and the Father are one , " the crowd picks up rocks to stone him to death .
He protests :
" Many good works have I shown you from my Father ; for which of those works do you stone me ? "
The Jews answered him , saying , " We do not stone you for a good work , but for blasphemy , and because you , being a man , make yourself God . "
And here it comes :
Jesus answered them , " Is it not written in your law , I said , you are gods [ quoting Psalms 82 ] ?
If He [ i.e. , God ] called those to whom He gave His word gods and you ca n’t contradict the Scriptures how can you say of Him whom the Father has sanctified and sent into the world , ‘ You blaspheme ! ’ because I said , ‘ I am a son of God " [ The original Greek says " a son , " not " the son . " ]
In other words , the Gospel , or " good news " that Jesus was trying to convey , despite the limitations of his tradition , was that we are all sons of God .
When he uses the terms I am ( as in " Before Abraham was , I am " ) or Me ( as in " No one comes to the Father but by Me " ) , he is intending to use them in the same way as Krishna in the Bhagavad - Gita :
He who sees
Me everywhere and sees all in Me ; I am not lost to him , nor is he lost to Me .
The yogi who , established in oneness , worships
Me abiding in all beings , lives in Me , whatever be his outward life .
And by this " Me " Krishna means the atman that is at once the basic self in us and in the universe .
To know this is to enjoy eternal life , to discover that the fundamental " I am " feeling , which you confuse with your superficial ego , is the ultimate reality forever and ever , amen .
In this essential respect , the , the Gospel has been obscured and muffled almost from the beginnings .
For Jesus was presumably trying to say that our consciousness is the divine spirit , " the light which enlightens every one who comes into the world , " and which George Fox , founder of the Quakers , called the Inward Light .
But the Church , still bound to the image of God as the King of kings , could n’t accept this Gospel .
It adopted a religion about Jesus instead of the religion of Jesus .
It kicked him upstairs and put him in the privileged and unique position of being the Boss ’s son , so that , having this unique advantage , his life and example became useless to everyone else .
The individual Christian must not know that his own " I am " is the one that existed before Abraham .
In this way , the Church institutionalized and made a virtue of feeling chronic guilt for not being as good as Jesus .
It only widened the alienation , the colossal difference , that monotheism put between man and God .
When I try to explain this to Jesus freaks and other Bible bangers , they invariably reveal theological ignorance by saying , " But does n’t the Bible say that Jesus was the only - begotten son of God ? "
It does n’t .
Not , at least , according to Catholic , Eastern Orthodox and Anglican interpretations .
The phrase " only - begotten son refers not to Jesus the man but to the Second Person of the Trinity , God the Son , who is said to have become incarnate in the man Jesus .
Nowhere does the Bible , or even the creeds of the Church , say that Jesus was the only incarnation of God the Son in all time and space .
Furthermore , it is not generally known that God the Son is symbolized as both male and female , as Logos - Sophia , the Design and the Wisdom of God , based on the passage in Proverbs 7:9 , where the Wisdom of God speaks as a woman .
" But then , " they go on to argue , " does n’t the Bible say that there is no other name under heaven whereby men may be saved except the name of Jesus ?
But what is the name of Jesus ?
J-E-S - U- S? Iesous ?
Aissa ?
Jehoshua ?
Or however else it may be pronounced ?
It is said that every prayer said in name of Jesus will be granted , and obviously this does n’t mean that " Jesus " is a signature on a blank check .
It means that prayers will be granted when made in the spirit of Jesus , and that spirit is , again , the Second Person of the Trinity , the eternal God the Son , who could just as well have been incarnate in Krishna , Buddha , Lao-tzu or Ramana Maharshi as in Jesus of Nazareth .
It is amazing what both the Bible and the Church are presumed to teach but do n’t teach .
Listening to fundamentalists , one would suppose that if there are living beings on other planets in this or other galaxies .
they must wait for salvation until missionaries from earth arrive on spaceships , bringing the Bible and baptism .
But if " God so loves the world " and means it , He will surely send
His son to wherever he is needed , and there is no difference in principle between a planet circling Alpha Centauri and peoples as remote from Palestine A.D. 30 as the Chinese or the Incas .
It should be understood that the expression " son of " means " of the nature of , " as when we call someone a son of a bitch and as when the Bible uses such phrases as " sons of Belial " ( an alien god ) , or an Arab cusses someone out as e- ben - i - el - homa " son of donkey ! " or simply " stupid " .
Used in this way , " son of " has nothing to do with maleness or being younger than .
Likewise , the Second Person of the Trinity , God the Son , the Logos - Sopia , refers to the basic pattern or design of the Universe , ever emerging from the inconceivable mystery or the Father as the galaxies shine out of space .
This is how the great philosophers of the Church have thought about the imagery of the Bible and as it appears to a modern student of the history and psychology of world religions .
Call it intellectual snobbery if you will , but although the books of the Bible might have been " plain words for plain people " in the days of Isaiah and Jesus , an uneducated and uninformed person who reads them today , and takes them as the literal Word of God , will become a blind and confused bigot .
Let us look at this against the background of the fact that all monotheistic religions have been militant .
Wherever God has been idolized as the King or Boss - Principle of the world , believers are agog to impose both their religion and their political rulership upon others .
Fanatical believers in the Bible , the Koran and the Torah have fought one another for centuries without realizing that they belong to the same pestiferous club , that they have more in common than they have against one another and that there is simply no way of deciding which of their " unique " revelations of God ’s will is the true one .
A committed believer in the Koran trots out the same arguments for his point of view as a Southern Baptist devotee of the Bible , and neither can listen to reason , because their whole sense of personal security and integrity depends absolutely upon pretending to follow an external authority .
The very existence of this authority , as well as the sense of identity of its follower and true believer , requires an excluded class of infidels , heathens and sinners people whom you can punish and bully so as to know that you are strong and alive .
No argument , no reasoning , no contrary evidence can possibly reach the true believer , who , if he is somewhat sophisticated , justifies and even glorifies his invincible stupidity as a " leap of faith " or " sacrifice of the intellect . "
He quotes the Roman lawyer and theologian Tertullian Credo , quia absurdum est , " I believe because it is absurd " as if Tertullian had said something profound .
Such people are , quite literally , idiots originally a Greek word meaning an individual so isolated that you ca n’t communicate with him .
Oddly enough , there are unbelievers who envy them , who wish that they could have the serenity and peace of mind that come from " knowing " beyond doubt that you have the true Word of God and are in the right .
But this overlooks the fact that those who supposedly have this peace within themselves are outwardly obstreperous and violent , standing in dire need of converts and followers to convince themselves of their continuing validity just as much as they need outsiders to punish .
Mindless belief in the literal truth of the Bible and furious zeal to spread the message lead to such widespread follies , in the American Bible Belt , as playing with poisonous snakes and drinking strychnine to prove the truth of Mark 16:18 , where Jesus is reported to have said : " They [ the faithful ] shall take up serpents : and if they drink any deadly , thing , it shall not hurt them . "
As recently as April 1973 , two men ( one a pastor ) in Newport , Tennessee , died in convulsions from taking large amounts of strychnine before a congregation shouting , " Praise God ! Praise God ! "
So they did n't have enough faith ; but such barbarous congregations will go on trying these experiments again and again to test and prove their faith , not realizing that by Christian standards this is arrant spiritual pride .
Meanwhile , the Government persecutes religious groups that use such relatively harmless herbs as peyote and marijuana for sacraments .
What is to be done about the existence of millions of such dangerous people in the world ?
Obviously , they must not be censored or suppressed by their own methods .
Even though it is impossible to persuade or argue with them in a reasonable way , it is just possible that they can be wooed and enchanted by a more attractive style of religion , which will show them that their unbending " faith " in their Bibles is simply an inverse expression of doubt and terror a frantic whistling in the dark .
There have been other images of God than the Father - Monarch : the Cosmic Mother ; the inmost Self ( disguised as all living beings ) , as in Hinduism ; the indefinable Tao , the flowing energy of the universe , as among the Chinese ; or no image at all , as with the Buddhists , who are not strictly atheists but who feel that the ultimate reality cannot be pictured in any way and , what is more , that not picturing it is a positive way of feeling it directly , beyond symbols and images .
I have called this " atheism in the name of God " a paradoxical and catchy phrase pointing out something missed by learned Protestant theologians who have been talking about " death of God " theology and " religionless Christianity , " and asking what of the Gospel of Christ can be saved if life is nothing more than a trip from the maternity ward to the crematorium .
It is weird how such sophisticated Biblical scholars must go on clinging to Jesus even when rejecting the basic principle of his teaching the experience that he was God in the flesh , an experience he unknowingly shared with all the great mystics of the world .
Atheism in the name of God is an abandonment of all religious beliefs , including atheism , which in practice is the stubbornly held idea that the world is a mindless mechanism .
Atheism in the name of God is giving up the attempt to make sense of the world in terms of any fixed idea or intellectual system .
It is becoming again as a child and laying oneself open to reality as it is actually and directly felt , experiencing it without trying to categorize , identify or name it .
This can be most easily begun by listening to the world with closed eyes , in the same way that one can listen to music without asking what it says or means .
This is actually a turn - on a state of consciousness in which the past and future vanish ( because they cannot be heard ) and in which there is no audible difference yourself and what you are hearing .
There is simply universe , an always present happening in which there is no perceptible difference between self and other , or , as in breathing , between what you do and what happens to you .
Without losing command of civilized behavior , you have temporarily " regressed " to what Freud called the oceanic feeling of the baby the feeling that we all lost in learning to make distinctions , but that we should have retained as their necessary background , just as there must be empty white paper under this print if you are to read it .
When you listen to the world in this way , you have begun to practice what Hindus and Buddhists call meditation a re-entry to the real world , as distinct from the abstract world of words and ideas .
If you find that you can't stop naming the various sounds and thinking in words , just listen to yourself doing that as another form of noise , a meaningless murmur like the sound of traffic .
I wo n't argue for this experiment .
Just try it and see what happens , because this is the basic act of faith of being unreservedly open and vulnerable to what is true and real .
Certainly this is what Jesus himself must have had in mind in that famous passage in the Sermon on the Mount upon which one will seldom hear anything from a pulpit : " Which of you by thinking can add a measure to his height ?
And why are you anxious about clothes ?
Look at the flowers of the field , how they grow .
They neither labor nor spin ; and yet I tell you that even Solomon in all his splendor was not arrayed like any one of them .
So if God so clothes the wild grass which lives for today and tomorrow is burned , shall He not much more clothe you , faithless ones ?
. . .
Do n't be anxious for the future , for the future will take care of itself .
Sufficient to the day are its troubles . "
Even the most devout Christians can’t take this .
They feel that such advice was all very well for Jesus , being the Boss 's son , but this is no wisdom for us practical and lesser - born mortals .
You can , of course , take these words in their allegorical and spiritual sense , which is that you stop clinging in terror to a rigid system of ideas about what will happen to you after you die , or as to what , exactly , are the procedures of the court of heaven , whereby the world is supposedly governed .
Curiously , both science and mysticism ( which might be called religion as experienced rather than religion as written ) are based on the experimental attitude of looking directly at what is , of attending to life itself instead of trying to glean it from a book .
The scholastic theologians would not look through Galileo ’s telescope , and Billy Graham will not experiment with a psychedelic chemical or practice yoga .
Two eminent historians of science , Joseph Needham and Lynn White , have pointed out the surprising fact that in both Europe and Asia , science arises from mysticism , because both the mystic and the scientist are types of people who want to know directly , for themselves , rather than be told what to believe .
And in this sense they follow the advice of Jesus to become again " as little children , " to look at the world with open , clear , and unprejudiced eyes , as if they had never seen it before .
It is in this spirit that an astronomer must look at the sky and a yogi must attend to the immediately present moment , as when he concentrates on a prolonged sound .
Years and years of book study may simply fossilize you into fixed habits of thought so that any perceptive person will know in advance how you will react to any situation or idea .
Imagining yourself reliable , you become merely predictable and , alas , boring .
Most sermons are tedious .
One knows in advance what the preacher is going to say , however dressed up on a fancy language .
Going strictly by the book , he will have no original ideas or experiences , for which reason both he and his followers become rigid and easily shocked personalities who cannot swing , wiggle , lilt or dance .
In this connection it should be noted that the blacks of the South swing and wiggle quite admirably , even in church but this is because the preacher , starting from the Bible in deference to his white overlords , very soon reverts to the rhythms and incantations of some old - time African religion , and there is no knowing at all what he is going to say .
This is perhaps one of the principle roots of conflict between whites and blacks in the American South that the former go by the Book and the latter by the spirit , which , like the wind , as Jesus put it , blows where it wills , and you ca n’t tell where it comes from or where it ’s going .
Thus , we reach the seeming paradox that you cannot at once idolize the Bible and embody the spirit of Jesus .
He twitted the Pharisees as today he would twit the fundamentalists : " You search the Scriptures daily , for in them you think you have life . "
The religion of Jesus was to trust life , both as he felt it in himself and as he saw it around him .
Most of us would feel that this was a ridiculous gamble to the Jews a stumbling block and to the Greeks foolishness but , come to think of it , is there any real alternative ?
Basiaclly , no human community can exist that is not founded on mutual trust as distinct from law and its enforcement .
The alternative to mutual trust , which is indeed a risky gamble , is the security of the police state .
CAIRO ( AP )  Pan -Arab
Al - Jazeera television broadcast what it described as excerpts from a new audio tape by Osama bin Laden in which the al - Qaeda leader slammed Palestinian negotiations with Israel and urged holy war for the liberation of Palestine .
The audio — the second by bin Laden in as many days — was the first time bin Laden spoke of the Palestinian question at length since the deteriorating situation in the Hamas - controlled Gaza Strip where Israel imposed a siege in response to heavy rocket fire by Gaza militants .
In the broadcast Thursday by the Doha , Qatar - based television , bin Laden said that " Palestine cannot be retaken by negotiations and dialogue , but with fire and iron . "
Bin Laden also called on Palestinians who are unable to fight in the " land of Al - Quds " — a Muslim reference to Jerusalem — to join the al - Qaeda fight and the holy war , or jihad , in Iraq .
" The nearest field of jihad today to support our people in Palestine is the Iraqi field , " said the voice reported to be bin Laden's .
" We tell our brothers in Palestine who could not join the jihad in the land of Al - Quds , to get rid of illusions of political parties and groups which are mired in trickery of the blasphemous democracy and to take their positions among the ranks of the mujahideen in Iraq . "
Such a Palestinian fight in Iraq should be " supported by all Muslims , specially from neighboring countries , " bin Laden added .
Al - Jazeera TV did not say how it obtained the recording , which was broadcast with an old photograph showing bin Laden in a white headscarf and traditional Arab dress .
As with bin Laden 's earlier audiotape , posted late Wednesday on a militant website that has carried al - Qaeda statements in the past , there was no indication when exactly it was made .
The two messages were bin Laden 's first this year .
In the Thursday audiotape on Al - Jazeera , bin Laden said the sufferings of the Palestinians in Gaza began when treacherous Arab leaders began supporting the U.S. - hosted Mideast peace conference in Annapolis , Maryland , last November , and the " Zionist entity . "
" By their support , they are considered partners to this horrible crime , " bin Laden said of Arab leaders who have backed the Mideast peace talks .
Bin Laden appeared to be seeking to merge the Palestinian cause into the wider al - Qaeda struggle .
Recently , there have been concerns al - Qaeda would try to increase its influence in Palestinian territories and supporters of the terror networks who sign into jihadi websites have called for such action .
Israel has been battling Hamas in Gaza since the Islamic militant group took control of the strip in June from followers of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas .
Israeli air raids are common in Gaza and militants fire rockets into Israeli towns near the strip .
" Palestine will not return to us with the negotiations by the submissive rulers , their conferences nor by demonstrations and elections , " bin Laden said .
" Palestine will come back to us if we awaken from our ignorance and adhere to our religion and sacrifice our lives and means to it . "
" My nation , " bin Laden addressed his followers , " You have a great opportunity to regain your freedom and get out of being a follower of this Zionist - crusade alliance and to do this , you have to free yourself from the chains of humiliation thrown on us by the agents of this alliance , the rulers of our countries . "
Ben Venzke , the head of IntelCenter , a U.S. group that monitors militant messages , said it was n't easy to draw significance from bin Laden 's audio on Al - Jazeera since only excerpts were broadcast and the TV did n't say how long the full recording was .
Although al - Qaeda has previously released two messages in as many days — most recently by bin Laden 's top deputy Ayman al - Zawahri in December — these latest audiotapes appeared to be the closest by bin Laden , Venzke said .
" al - Qaeda has been making a concerted effort to be responsive to developments in news cycle and to respond to current events with their perspective on it , " Venzke said .
" The situation in Gaza and the reprinting of cartoons was something bin Laden felt was important to address . "
Venzke expected a broader release of the statement on Al - Jazeera to surface within 72 hours .
A militant website that frequently carries al - Qaeda postings , said later Thursday it expected bin Laden 's new audio on " The Way to Salvage Palestine " soon .
In Israel , Foreign Ministry spokesman Arye Mekel told The Associated Press that Israel does not comment on bin Laden 's statements .
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said , " We and the international community must prove him wrong , because we have been pursuing peace through negotiations , and I believe the parties involved must make every effort to make the year 2008 a year of peace . "
In Wednesday 's five - minute recording , bin Laden accused Pope Benedict XVI of helping in a " new Crusade " against Islam and warned of a " severe " reaction for Europeans ' publication of cartoons seen by Muslims as insulting Islam 's prophet Mohammed .
That message raised concerns al - Qaeda was plotting new attacks in Europe .
Some experts said bin Laden , believed to be in hiding in the Afghan - Pakistan border area , may be unable to organize such an attack himself and instead was trying to fan anger over the cartoons to inspire violence by supporters .
A U.S. counterterrorism official said Thursday that " CIA analysis assesses with a high degree of confidence it is Osama bin Laden 's voice on the tape " and that there was " no reason to doubt bin Laden is alive . "
The official spoke on condition of anonymity because of intelligence matters involved .
State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said that although the whole of Wednesday 's message had not been received yet , it was clear " the contents ... are filled with hate and encouraging people to murder innocents in the name of a perverted and depraved cause . "
On Feb .
13 , Danish newspapers republished one of the cartoons , which shows Muhammad wearing a bomb - shaped turban , to illustrate their commitment to freedom of speech after police said they had uncovered a plot to kill the artist .
Vatican spokesman , Rev. Federico Lombardi , said Thursday that bin Laden 's accusation the pope had played a role in a worldwide campaign against Islam was " baseless . "
Lombardi said the pope has repeatedly criticized the cartoons , first published in some European newspapers in 2006 and republished by Danish papers in February .

How long until this story hits the national news ?
More from my friend David who is dogging this fight .
The previous link has David ’s back and forth with Facebook on this issue .
And this link is his earlier post giving you more background on the story .
In his beautiful essay , The Art of Lisp & Writing , Richard Gabriel makes a strong case for the use of programming mediums instead of programming languages when either introducing programming to students or starting a new project .
He says :
“ The difference between Lisp and Java , as Paul Graham has pointed out , is that Lisp is for working with computational ideas and expression , whereas Java is for expressing completed programs .
As James [ Gosling ] says , Java requires you to pin down decisions early on .
And once pinned down , the system which is the set of type declarations , the compiler , and the runtime system make it as hard as it can for you to change those assumptions , on the assumption that all such changes are mistakes you ’re inadvertently making .
There are , of course , many situations when making change more difficult is the best thing to do :
Once a program is perfected , for example , or when it is put into light - maintenance mode .
But when we are exploring what to create given a trigger or other impetus — when we are in flow — we need to change things frequently , even while we want the system to be robust in the face of such changes .
In fact , most design problems we face in creating software can be resolved only through experimentation with a partially running system .
Engineering is and always has been fundamentally such an enterprise , no matter how much we would like it to be more like science than like art . ”
[ Highlights mine ]
I too believe that learning and experimenting require a Language like Lisp , Scheme , Smalltalk , Python and Ruby which offer a read - eval - print - loop ( i.e. an interactive shell ) .
Naturally , you ’ll always need the big-iron compilers but only when the program is perfected …
As Frederick Brooks writes in The Mythical Man-Month , plan to throw one away , you will anyhow … .
In most engineering fields , prototypes are routinely built using more malleable materials than the ones that are going to be used in production ( for e.g. airplane prototypes made of wood ) .
It ’s only in our field , Programming , that people build prototypes using production - quality ( but extremely rigid and constraining ) languages like C++ and Java and spend so much time and money in this process that they are forced to ship the prototypes to customers with obvious consequences !
Using a malleable programming language
This semester , I am going to teach Programming Languages to second year university students .
Those students have been exposed to C++ in the first year and Java at the beginning of the second year .
Both programming languages are good for expressing perfected programs but are bad for experimenting .
( By coincidence , there were two interesting discussions on Slashdot ( One Two . ) following an article by some professors criticizing Java .
Joel Spolsky thinks that it is perilous to use Java at school .
I wo n’t even mention C++ as I personally think it ’s the worst ( by far ) language to be used for teaching programming !
Together with Pascal Grosset who will be handling one of the lab sessions , I have been thinking a lot about what paradigms ( and , hence , what programming languages ) to use for my lecture .
I think that I ’ll only have time to introduce three paradigms and , hence , at most three programming languages ( or mediums ) .
This is what we have come up with :
Functional programming with Scheme
Logic programming with Prolog ( or , maybe , Kanren )
Scripting with Ruby
The first lecture
I did my first Programming Languages lecture last Friday and I enjoyed it a lot .
I arrived in the lecture theatre at around 9:00 and I quickly installed OpenOffice.org on the Windows laptop there as I had prepared my presentation using OO Impress .
During the installation , I asked the 180 students how many of them found programming easy and only a few raised their hands ( remember – those are second year students ) .
I was a little surprised because I thought there were more .
Anyway , I told them about my little theory that they should make a lot of effort now to acquire knowledge to be effective when they work so that they can return home early and enjoy life instead of having to stay overtime everyday :-)
I also told them that we were going to focus a lot on the functional , logic and scripting paradigms .
And I also tried to make them understand that becoming a competent programmer require practice like all artistic endeavors .
My first real lecture on Scheme will only begin next Friday as tomorrow is a public holiday .
Why Scheme ?
I have been a fan of the Scheme programming language since I was introduced to it during my first year as a university student in France .
Since then I ’ve found out that Scheme is used at top universities like MIT and Berkeley to teach programming .
Why is that so ?
Because Scheme is easy to learn yet , easy to use yet powerful !
I have decided to use the fantastic DrScheme IDE .
It is multi-platform ( Linux , Mac OS X and Windows ) and is a joy to use .
It ’s , naturally , open source software .
I am currently in the process of installing DrScheme in all the Computer Science labs .
I am still wondering what textbook I ’ll use …
I bought “ How to Design Programs ” by Matthias Felleisen , Robert Bruce Findler , Matthew Flatt , Shriram Krishnamurthi a year ago and it is an excellent book written by some of the makers of DrScheme .
I am a little bit hesitant to use it as it uses slightly customized versions of Scheme instead of the standardized Scheme .
Anyway , I ’m still making my mind .
I have also ordered the Schemer triumvirate through Amazon and I expect to receive them in one or two weeks .
“ The Little Schemer ” is a little book ( how surprising ! ) that covers functions ( closures ) and recursion .
Many of you may feel that recursion is simple but Scheme guarantees that tail - recursive functions are executed without using increasing stack space hence the book goes into a lot of detail .
The second book , “ The Seasoned Schemer ” , talks about mutable state ( i.e. variables ) and about the special control flow constructs based on the continuations found in Scheme .
Continuations allow for coroutines , concurrency , etc. and are important to understand if one really wants to be a Schemer ( a Scheme programmer ) .
The final book is “ The Reasoned Schemer ” which is a book on reasoning ( aha ! ) .
It introduces Kanren , a small library to transform Scheme into a better - than - Prolog programming language for logic and inference .
Why not Lisp ?
I ’ve also ordered “ Practical Common Lisp ” by Peter Siebel from Amazon .
I have decided not to use Lisp because the de-facto IDE , Emacs +
Slime , while extremely powerful , is too intimidating for young students .
Another reason is that Common Lisp is a beast and is tough to learn …
Conclusion
Learning by experimenting is the best way to learn .
Learning programming using Scheme is fun and rewarding as the language is so malleable .
A University is not only a place where people go to get a degree .
Rather it ’s a place where intelligent people ( students + academics ) meet to share knowledge .
Someone wrote on Slashdot :
“ When Plato and Aristotle founded their schools , they did n’t put up a big sign that said “ When you ’re done , you get more money . ”
That was n’t the promise .
The promise was that by teaching you about the world , you would become a better person .
That is to say , the founding concept of the University was that education lead to human excellence . ”
My students will become better persons by experimenting with Scheme :-)
Just about all of the systems I ’ve written about here share quite a few things in common : they are poorly designed , poorly coded , and even more poorly documented .
Today , I ’m happy to share with you a system that does n’t quite fit in with all the rest .
It ’s actually very sound software and , most of all , it ’s well documented .
Very , very well documented .
George Nacht is a software engineer in certain a Post - Communist European country .
In the mid-1990 ’s , his government decided that it was time to replace their foreign , Soviet - era fighter jets with modern , less expensive aircrafts of domestic design .
And since they were modernizing their fleet , they decided to modernize their pilot training as well .
This meant that new , interactive flight - simulator software needed to be developed .
Instead of going with an incredibly expensive , all - encompassing defense contractor , the Air Force decided to try something new .
They awarded the contract to the small game development company that George worked for .
Though it was their first government contract , they were confident that they ’d be able to deliver the project on time and within budget .
After all , the software required was actually less advanced than the flight simulator they had developed earlier : no “ high score ” tables , flashy animations , or anything like that .
Just the basics .
George ’s contact at the Air Force was a gruff , old general with a vast knowledge of aerial warfare and forty years experience in the service .
Naturally , he was very skeptical of the new guys ’ ability to develop a “ military grade ” product .
After all , they had n’t spent a single day in uniform .
But George ’s team quickly won him with a demonstration : one month after being awarded the contract , they had fully replicated the prototype plane ’s specifications in their software .
In less than a year , they completed the adaptation of their flight simulator to work with the fancy training hardware .
And by fancy I mean a full - sized cockpit with six display screens , sixteen force - feedback motors , and an absurd amount of buttons and controls .
Everyone loved it .
Pilots said it flew like the real thing and the general was thrilled to be able to experience flight ( albeit , simulated ) once again .
“ Gentlemen , ” the general started during one of their wrap - up meetings , “ you have done very well .
I am very impressed .
There is , however , one problem .
You did not provide nearly enough documentation . ”
George ’s boss nervously chuckled , unsure whether the general was being sarcastic or not .
After all , they did deliver nearly 500 printed pages of diagrams specifications .
An awkward silence ensued .
“ You see gentlemen , ” the general continued , “ for such expensive program , we require at least eight meters of documentation . ”
He stretched his arms as far as he could to illustrate .
Clearly , he was not joking .
George ’s team had no idea how to meet this requirement , so they just started printing .
Everything .
Source code , screenshots , log files , hexadecimal dumps , emails , resumes .
And they found out that – even with big fonts , think paper , and double spacing – it ’s pretty damn hard to fill eight meters ( that ’s nearly two stories , twenty - six feet , or 320 - inches ) with paper .
After a few weeks of printing and binding , they were finally ready to deliver the documentation .
Arriving at the archive facility with a small truck , they unloaded the boxes of paper and met the general .
With an approving nod and smile , he led them through a labyrinth of shelves and cabinets .
They stopped at one with exactly eight meters of free space and labeled with the name of the flight simulator project .
It was right between the shelves containing “ Section F ” of the T - 72 battle tank specifications and a series of old tomes labeled List of Suitable Locations for Auxiliary Cemeteries .
They loaded box after box onto the free shelf .
Without opening a single book , the general thanked them for creating such extensive documentation .
Although those boxes will never be opened again , George and his team went home happy to have contributed a flight simulator for their country ’s defense program .
And , of course , eight meters of documentation on it .

LONDON , England ( CNN ) --
The UK's Prince Harry has been serving on the frontline in Afghanistan and seen combat , but his deployment will be reviewed after the news was leaked by a U.S. Web site , the UK Ministry of Defense confirmed Thursday .
He was deployed 10 weeks ago and his fellow soldiers were sworn to secrecy .
" At the end of the day I like to sort of be a normal person , and for once I think this is about as normal as I 'm ever going to get , " the 23 - year - old prince said in a recent interview .
Harry is third in line to the British throne and serves with the Blues and Royals .
The information had been kept secret for security reasons , said Gen. Richard Dannatt , the chief of Britain 's General Staff .
Because of the unique circumstances of the deployment .
CNN , as well as other news organizations , chose to honor an embargo requested by the military .
The prince is a member of a group called Joint Tactical Air Control , or JTAC .
He holds the rank of cornet -- equivalent to a second lieutenant -- and serves as a forward air controller .
Watch Prince Harry on the front lines in Afghanistan »
His duties include calling in airstrikes and air support when necessary , guaranteeing the accuracy of bombing on the ground and guarding against incidents of friendly fire .
" As far as I 'm concerned , I 'm out here as a normal JTAC on the ground and not as Prince Harry , " he said .
Do n't Miss TIME.com : Prince Harry deploys to Afghanistan
Harry is the younger son of Prince Charles , the heir to the British throne , and the late Princess Diana , who died in a Paris car crash in 1997 .
The military confirmed his assignment after a U.S. Web site broke the news blackout -- and Dannatt expressed displeasure at the report .
Watch how a top secret operation deployed Prince Harry »
" I am very disappointed that foreign Web sites have decided to run this story without consulting us , " Dannatt said in a written statement .
" It was my judgment that with an understanding with the media not to broadcast his whereabouts , the risk in ( deploying him to Afghanistan ) was manageable .
" Now that the story is in the public domain , the Chief of Defence Staff and I will take advice from the operational commanders about whether his deployment can continue . "
Last year , the military ruled Harry could not be sent to Iraq because publicity about the deployment could put him and his unit at risk .
But Dannatt said the experience has demonstrated " that it is perfectly possible for Prince Harry to be employed just the same as other Army officers of his rank and experience . "
" His conduct on operations in Afghanistan has been exemplary , " the general said .
" He has been fully involved in operations and has run the same risks as everyone else in his battle group .
In common with all of his generation in the army today , he is a credit to the nation . "
Watch Prince Harry on the front lines »
Shortly after the news of the prince 's deployment broke , several Islamist Web sites posted messages alerting their " brethren " in Afghanistan to be on the lookout for the royal soldier .
" O brothers of monotheism , if you find anyone with unusual security in his battalion , know that this could be the Prince Harry .
We ask God that he gets caught on your hands , " one such posting read .
Several members of the British royal family have seen combat over the past century .
Harry 's grandfather , Prince Phillip , served aboard warships in World War II ; his great - grandfather -- King George VI -- took part in the World War I naval battle of Jutland ; and Prince Andrew , Harry 's uncle , flew Navy helicopters during Britain 's 1982 war with Argentina over the Falkand Islands .
Harry 's brother , Prince William , is also an army officer .
But as second in line for the throne , he is specifically barred from combat .
The last sitting British monarch to lead troops in battle was George II , who defeated a French force at the Battle of Dettingen in 1743 .

Canadians who go to Cuba often pack something to help out the locals .
Me ?
I decided to bring my beloved Muffs surfboard as a gift .
Announcements , Events & more from Tyee and select partners John Horton ’s Paintings Preserve History .
His Seamanship Saves Lives
Meet the fascinating Order of BC winner who also happens to be a Tyee supporter .
In Havana , there are about 30 surfers , a small but highly dedicated community .
But surfboards in Cuba are extremely difficult to come by .
Many surfers share one board , and you can't find any for rent or for sale in the country .
So how do surfers there get boards ?
Sometimes by scavenging old refrigerators for their foam cores , and building from there .
Other times visiting surfers like me leave our boards behind , often at the boatyards near the Marina Hemmingway Wharf .
Boarding issues
My Muffs is a longboard built sometime in the late ' 70s and named after an all girl punk band .
The board is old and heavy with fat rails and a lot of meat in it and could use some repair but in a country choc-o - bloc with pre-revolution Chevys and Fords , repairing the board should be a snap .
The Muffs was a popular loaner in Tofino , originating with Ralph Tieleman 's generosity and passing between many surfers including the artist Aaron Marshall who painted the distinct musical note and Muffs logo on the board as Ralph 's message - on - a- surfboard to Kim of the Muffs .
Or as Muffs rider Neil McQueen Facebooked from New Zealand ; " If boards could talk ! "
Getting the Muffs board to Cuba was my first concern .
The maximum length of board that Air Canada allows is 6 ' 8 " ( part of a global war on longboards ) and The Muffs board is 9 ' 6 " and as I mentioned , weighs a lot .
Although I was flying a charter and had made pre-arrangements , I was still nervous that once we got to the airport there would be complications .
At check - in , the Air Transat attendant asked me , " Is this a windsurf board ? "
And that was about it .
Surf , not war
I realized my concerns were nothing compared to those faced by my inspiration for this gesture , Dorian Paskowitz .
" Doc " Paskowitz , an 86 - year - old Jewish surfing guru based in California , is considered the father of Israeli surfing ( as well as nine children many raised in a Winnebago by the sea ) .
Paskowitz donated a dozen surfboards last year to Gaza 's small surfing community , in a gesture he hoped would get Israelis and Palestinians riding for peace .
" God will surf with the devil if the waves are good , " Paskowitz was quoted as saying .
" When a surfer sees another surfer with a board , he can't help but say something that brings them together . "
Inspired by his approach I have informally created the organization Boards Not Bombs ( soon to be formalized , whatever that means . ) .
I hope in the near future to take a Boards Not Bombs crew to the Middle East for another hit of peace ( they could always use it ) .
I have more faith in that than anything Bush could dream of accomplishing .
Breaking the ice
The first surfers I met while schlepping my board through the white - light - white - heat streets of Havana lived under the shadow of the monumental Russian embassy in the western section of Cuba known as Miramar .
Sitting on the steps of a modernist two story apartment ( think beach Bauhaus ) were three young men .
One in Rip Curl shorts .
" Surfista ? "
" Si. Si . "
Yo tengo uno tabla de surf . "
" Si , Si . "
Sitting on the steps were :
Daniel , 30 , a computer programmer and a self - described " surf pioneer ' in Cuba who began surfing the Miramar coast as a mere " chico . "
For a board he used his desktop from school .
He next made a board out of the insulation from refrigerators and heavy boat fiberglass scrounged from the Marina Hemingway Wharf
Angel , 38 , a cook at a four star hotel who took a lot of ribbing for his happy cooking belly and fear of reefs .
David , 27 , a full - time percussionist and surf bum .
" Surfing Libre ! Music libre ! "
We chuckled and agreed how the two are similar in spirit -- especially true in a country alive with music on every corner and calle .
We chatted for a while in the Esperanto of surf slang , and then piled into Daniel 's Lada to go to the beach and check the surf .
" You can surf in Canada ? " asked Daniel on the way to the beach .
" What do you have to do , break through the ice ? "
I explained that five - millimetre wetsuits are necessary for surfing in the frigid water in wintertime .
" That be like surfing in a condom , " said Daniel .
Flotsam and jetsam
We also found ourselves in the age - old surfing discussion of longboard versus short .
As regards sex or surfing , we agreed : why not both ?
During the months of December through early March , northeast trade winds deliver small , warm ( 20 C ) , surf - able swells ( perfect for longboards ) to the northeast shores of Cuba , including areas in and around Havana .
A gnarly , sharp , shallow coral reef made things a bit treacherous but contributed to a well - shaped wave .
The shore was strewn with water bottles , condoms and blue , bloated man of wars .
The detritus contrasted sharply with the inviting azure colours of the Caribbean tossing onto the shore .
' Fidel does n't care '
As we checked the surf , which was too flat that day , I could n't help but notice the number of joggers and exercisers in the parks , beaches and streets of Cuba .
I asked my companions where surfing fit in to this scheme .
" Fidel does n't care about surfing , " Daniel says with a shrug .
" Because it is n't an Olympic sport . "
Is there room in a proletariat revolution for a surf bum ?
Most definitely .
" As long as there are waves . "
Daniel told me there are no surf contests in Cuba but pointed out that Cuban - American surfer Cory Lopez came over a few years ago for a first - of - its kind surf expedition .
" He rips . "
We surfed two days of mushy pinners - with the Muffs boards and a fishtail that one of the guys borrowed from a friend .
And then I left my Muffs board behind with my three amigos .
They hustled it into the house in broad daylight ( its what the Cubans seemed to do with gifts )
Safe sex bakery
No doubt there are deep flaws in aspects of the Cuban political system .
For me the main thing the average Cuban person seems to be missing is freedom to travel .
The spirit of the place is very free .
Speaking of which , we also brought 300 hundred condoms , and delivered them to Café Salud in Downtown Havana , a youth drop - in centre where issues of safe sex are discussed .
We arrive in a taxi to the address , a bakery selling those extra frosty , very sweet and pink Cuban cakes .
A middle - aged woman doing a brisk trade with the cakes greets us .
" Café Salud ? "
" Si ? "
An overheated baker called out to her from the back .
" Café Salud ? " we ask again , confused .
" Si ? "
I opened the box of condoms , some of which are flavoured , to show the woman .
" Oh , si , si ... "
We were relieved to learn that the bakery hosts the youth in their off - hours .
We also gave the woman piles of sealed makeup and mascara , which she seemed especially pleased with .
Adios
Near the end of the trip , my six - year - old son left his beloved boogie board ( it 's got flames on it -- c'mon ! ) with some kids playing on the beach .
Yet , no matter what we brought to give to Cuba , it gave way more back .
Muchas gracias , Muffs .
Muchas gracias , Cuba .

If you 're anything like me , you like to drink beer , but you 're fed up with the lengths you have to go to open the damn things .
Walk ten feet ?
Are you serious ?
Open a drawer ?
It 's too much .
Here are ten very special implements you 'll want to keep directly on your person .
Whenever and wherever festivity presents itself , you 'll be lying in wait like a beer - opening snake , ready to strike .
Eat , Open , Drink
If you 're like me , you hate nothing more than switching utensils while eating .
Putting that fork down in the middle of dinner in order to grab something else is an indignity you should n't be forced to suffer .
That 's why the spork is so popular ( apart from the great name ) .
Ever get frustrated because you wanted a drink but did n't want to stop eating to open it ?
Worry no more !
With this bottle opener / fork combination ( bottle forkener ?
fottle openork ?
borkle fopener ? ) you can dig in , fill your mouth with food and , while chewing , easily open your beer to wash the dinner down .
All it needs now is a slightly more curved face to add spoon - functionality and a sharp blade on the side for dicing your food / enemies .
Do it all .
Never change hands .
Welcome to the future .
It 's What Our Ancestors Did
Nothing says " man " like working with tools and knocking back some cold ones with the other guys .
Now you crack a cold one mid-swing with this combination hammer / bottle opener .
Drive some nails , open a beer , and then laugh as you try to nail wood again only to smash Neil in the face with the hammer .
Now , this bottle opener does diminish the normal nail - removing function of the hammer , but when you can drink and work with the same tool , the alcohol will ensure you do n't even notice those messed up nails .
Not only will this make fixing the leaky roof on a hot day more fun , it 'll turn you into a Jesus - level carpenter at the same time .
“ That 's Not a Bottle Opener .
Now That 's a Bottle Opener . ”
I do n't know who exactly came up with the idea to put a bottle opener on the back - end of a combat knife , but may God bless them .
What better way to show others how manly you are than to kill something with a knife and then -- in the same motion -- open a celebratory beer ?
Just imagine the possibilities !
You can go into a bar , and when they ask if you 're carrying any weapons , you can honestly say , “ Just my bottle opener , ” and get in .
When the angry drunk challenges you to a fight and takes out a tiny switchblade , just think of how badass it will be when you say , “ That 's not fair .
At least let me use my bottle opener , ” and then whip this bad boy out .
Sure , being intoxicated and using a sharpened killing tool may be “ dangerous ” and result in a few “ accidents , ” but at least it will be easier to convince the authorities you were drunk at the time when they witness a demonstration of your bottle opening capabilities down at the station .
Like Superman , But With a Problem
This one makes the list due to the convenience factor and possibilities for showmanship rather than for being downright cool .
You may think there 's nothing flashy about having a bottle opener on your ring , but then you 'd be wrong .
There 's a reason you 're reading this , pal !
Take this scenario , for example : you 're at a party and a hot chick is struggling with a beer .
You walk over and say , “ Let me take care of that for you , ” grabbing the bottle .
“ But ... it 's not a twist cap , " she says .
" Do n't you need an opener ? ” Laughing , you grab the cap with your hand and in one smooth motion rip it right off the bottle .
Handing it back to her , you mumble , “ Nah , I 'm good , ” and walk away .
Of course , 9 out of 10 guys would probably make a complete and utter fool ( or jackass ) out of themselves pulling that stunt .
But for the one guy who can pull it off and look cool , that girl is his for the rest of the night .
Just make sure you do n't wear this ring on your left hand .
( That brings up another interesting idea regarding wedding rings and their practicality ... but that 's neither here nor now . )
Nothing Says “ Drunk ” Like Talking Megalomaniacal Babies
I admit it , this one is just something I personally like .
As a huge fan of Family Guy , having a talking Stewie Bottle Opener just seems like a good idea that I should 've thought of myself .
This bottle opener comes with five Stewie phrases , including , “ Who the hell do you think you are ? ! ” and “ Thank you .
When the world is mine , your death shall be quick and painless ! ”
Not only will you and anyone you drink with be entertained by Stewie 's lovable antics , but it's also a great reminder as to why some guys drink in the first place .
I 'm still not sure if getting drunk while constantly looking at a baby is a wise decision , so I 'd like to have some test subjects volunteers try that out -- just to make sure it would n't make me do something I 'd later regret .
Just Do n't Mistake It For the Ice Dispenser
This bad boy uses a high strength magnet to hook to your fridge , allowing you to pull out a cold one and open it up without wasting a step .
Not only does it have enough sticking power to allow you to rip off a bottle cap , it 's also equipped with the ability to make any cheap fridge from Wal - Mart , Goodwill , Target or K - Mart look fancy and expensive .
It 's practical , and it will make your girlfriend / wife / significant other shut up about getting a nicer looking fridge .
( And if it does n't , just stick this to their back — it should hold due to the large metal rod up her ass . )
Giggity Giggity Goo !
Another combination bottle opener .
This time , though , it 's even better than hammers , knives or rings !
It 's a belt buckle / bottle opener !
I 'm not sure if you 're meant to take off the belt to open bottles or open the bottles while wearing it , but either way makes for a good time .
You 're either using your hip motions to open a beer for a lady or you 've got an excuse to take off your belt .
Win-win ?
Opening Sweet
Soon , everyone will be rushing to merchandise Halo 3 .
There will be sodas , MP3 players , clothing , commercials , billboards and most likely a few random body surfaces ( thanks to eBay ) .
Why not beat them to the punch and use the biggest , baddest Spartan to open your beer for you ?
Nothing says manly like forcing a manlier man to be your bitch .
It 's remedial Prison Theory .
Just be wary of the fact that people might not know this is a bottle opener , so be prepared for 12 year - old Halo fanboys marveling at your kewl keychain .
The First Rule of Fight Club ...
I 'm not an idiot — I know you can't use these as a real pair of knucks ... unless you have no thumb !
For the thumbless out there , this gives you a nice combo brass knuckles / bottle opener , allowing you to knock anyone - who - makes - fun - of - your - unfortunate - fate the fuck out , and then enjoy a cold one .
You can also make up a cool story about how you cut off your thumb just to use this , rather than the true , lame story about getting frostbite after getting locked out of your house while your parents were living it up at Fuddruckers or some such bullshit .
For you two - thumbers out there , this will at least look badass ( more so than a keychain ) , and -- who knows ?
-- maybe you can trick your drunk friend into putting them on .
Who'd be more seriously injured : the guy being punched , or the guy forcing his thumb into a bottle opener by punching someone ?
A Look into the Future ...
This would n't be very practical to carry around to parties or take outside , but I do n't care : I want one anyway .
Honestly , using a traditional bottle opener is n't that much of a chore , but we 're American , damnit !
The easier the better !
If I can open a bottle by just lowering a cylinder over it , I want to not even have to do that !
I want the cylinder to lower itself !
While we 're at it , why are we even spending the time focusing on bottle openers , anyway ?
We should be spending this time doing something more productive , like figuring out a way to hook up beer to an IV and pump it straight into our systems without causing death or some other horrible side effect .
We can get a man to the moon , but we can't inject beer into our systems ?
Disgusting .
Maybe the Commies won after all .

Researchers at the University of British Columbia and the Harvard Business School have found that it ’s possible to buy happiness after all : when you spend money on others .
In a series of studies , UBC Asst. Prof. Elizabeth Dunn found that individuals report significantly greater happiness if they spend money “ pro-socially ” – that is on gifts for others or charitable donations – rather than spending on themselves .
Her findings will appear in the March 21 edition of the journal Science .
“ We wanted to test our theory that how people spend their money is at least as important as how much money they earn , ” says Dunn , who teaches in the UBC Dept. of Psychology and is lead author of the study .
Her co-authors are UBC master ’s student Lara Aknin and Michael Norton , an assistant professor at the Harvard Business School .
The researchers looked at a nationally representative sample of more than 630 Americans , of whom 55 per cent were female .
They asked participants to : rate their general happiness ; report their annual income ; and provide a breakdown of their monthly spending , including bills , gifts for themselves , gifts for others and donations to charity .
“ Regardless of how much income each person made , ” says Dunn , “ those who spent money on others reported greater happiness , while those who spent more on themselves did not ”
The study also measured the happiness levels of employees at a firm in Boston before and after they received their profit - sharing bonus , which ranged between $ 3,000 and $ 8,000 .
What affected the employees ’ happiness , says Dunn , was not so much the size of the bonus but how they spent it .
The employees who devoted more of their bonus to gifts for others or toward charity consistently reported greater benefits than employees who simply spent money on their own needs .
In another experiment , the researchers gave participants a $ 5 or $ 20 bill , asking them to spend the money by 5 p.m. that day .
Half the participants were instructed to spend the money on themselves , and half were assigned to spend the money on others .
Participants who spent the windfall on others reported feeling happier at the end of the day than those who spent the money on themselves .
“ These findings suggest that very minor alterations in spending allocations – as little as $ 5 – may be enough to produce real gains in happiness on a given day , ” says Dunn .

Is being generous the next beauty trend ?
This document describe an approach to SQL queries of hierarchical data using ancestor tables .
Multiple inheritance are allowed but cycles are not allowed for this approach to work .
This approach is most appropriate when recursive SQL is not available and the hierarchies are not too deep .
With ancestor tables , inserts and deletes are slower but selects are very fast and there is no need to update the whole tree with each insert .
We use this hierarchy of objects as an example to illustrate the problem :
ObjectID ParentID 5 3 6 3 6 4 7 4 3 2 4 2 2 1
This table can keep the relationships between the objects but does not allow to search for all the ancestors of an object or all the children of a parent using single SQL queries .
This table can keep the relationships between the objects but does not allow to search for all the ancestors of an object or all the children of a parent using single SQL queries .
Using an ancestor table instead of a parent table has the advantage of flattening the relationships between object and simplifying the queries : ObjectID AncestorID hops 5 3 1 5 2 2 5 1 3 6 3 1 6 2 2 6 1 3 6 4 1 6 2 2 6 1 3 7 4 1 7 2 2 7 1 3 3 2 1 3 1 2 4 2 1 4 1 2 2 1 1
Using an ancestor table instead of a parent table has the advantage of flattening the relationships between object and simplifying the queries :
Modeling the same hierarchy requires more records when ancestors are explicitly recorded but it simplifies the queries .
For example , to get all the children of object - 1 : select distinct object_id from ancestor_table where ancestor_id = 1 ; object_id=======567342
Modeling the same hierarchy requires more records when ancestors are explicitly recorded but it simplifies the queries .
For example , to get all the children of object - 1 : In order to preserve the hierarchical order , a third column called ' hops ' can be added to the table .
This is useful when query results need to be in order of proximity of the object to the ancestor .
Saving the number of hops information in the table also allows to recontruct the table from scratch by first deleting all the records with hops > 1 and then re-inserting all the ancestors .
The records with hops=1 are equivalent to the parent table , hops > 1 are the ancestor records .

It is also important to have the ability to add and delete associations from this graph without having to re-write the complete tree to the database .
This is the general algorithm for inserting and deleting an association in the graph :
To add an association between child1 and parent1 , find all the parents of parent1 and attach them to each children of child1
It is also important to have the ability to add and delete associations from this graph without having to re-write the complete tree to the database .
This is the general algorithm for inserting and deleting an association in the graph : Similarly , for deleting an association :
To remove an association between child1 and parent1 , find all the parents of parent1 and remove them from each child of child1 Similarly , for deleting an association :
For this solution to work , redundant associations need to be recorded in the database .
In our example , there is two associations between object - 6 and object - 2 , one using object - 3 and one using object - 4 .
They both need to be present in the ancestor table .
This allows the delete function to delete only one of the two associations .
In our example , even after removing the object - 3 to object - 2 association , object - 6 can still reach object - 2 .

# oid is a postgres generated sequence_id used to identify each association .
foreach my $o ( @$rc3 ) { sql ( " delete from ancestor_table where oid = $ o - > [ 0 ] " ) ; last ; } }}
A common way to model this hierarchy is with a Parent table :

The Real Record of George W. Bush ( And the Hidden Agenda for His War )
I grant that George W. Bush may actually believe he 's doing the right thing and " doing God 's will , " as he claims .
I also do n’t want to kick a man when he ’s down .
But , since he can’t admit it , and since he is still unrepentant and arrogantly stubborn and self - righteous , I am duty bound to tell you the truth as I know it .
In my view , Bush deludes himself and has in effect deceived those who believe in him .
He is not doing the right thing , and he does not serve God .
He instead serves what Jesus called " Mammon . "
I 'll cover the major reasons why , including facts regarding both his domestic and foreign policies , as well as the hidden agenda and folly of Bush 's War .
But I 'll begin with first things first .
Consider Bush 's original campaign promises to be a " compassionate conservative " and to " put an end to partisanship . "
Those proved to be very false promises , since both his domestic and foreign policies and his initiatives and executive orders have certainly not been compassionate toward all the people in America and in the world who have been harmed by them , and especially since he has proven to be an arrogant , hard right - wing ideologue and an extremely partisan and divisive president .
He has only created more polarized and more bitter partisanship .
That has been demonstrated in nearly everything Bush has done , and it is the main reason he has ignored so much good advice , made so many mistakes and come under so much criticism , not only in America , but in many other countries in the world .
His impact on the whole world has been negative and even devastating , and it just keeps getting worse .
For example , lets 's consider Bush 's Reaganite domestic economic record .
After all , he followed the example of Ronald Reagan , and the initial result was a terrible recession , and ever since then the richest few have gotten even more rich while everyone else has become worse off .
If you wonder why I call Bush a Reaganite who followed Reagan 's example , see the page titled The Real Legacy of Ronald Reagan .
That explains how and why Bush followed Reagan 's example with his recession and his economic policies .
Of course , Bush tried very hard to blame his recession on his predecessor , President Clinton .
However , the Clinton Administration balanced the budget and produced a booming economy .
Furthermore , even though Bush 's recession was partially the result of Federal Reserve interest hikes that were designed to slow the economy down and prevent possible inflation , Bush 's recession did n't really start to get bad until Bush and Dick Cheney used gloom and doom language about the economy .
In fact , they started to do that even before they took office , claiming that Clinton 's economic policies were not really good .
They kept it up even more after they took office , and the more they claimed that the economy was or would be terrible , the worse it got , because the business community and the stock market reacted to their pessimistic and gloomy portrayal and predictions .
That was a Reaganite tactic , and I suspect it was partly to worsen the economy to punish the middle and low income labor force and put them " in their place , " as Reagan so deliberately did .
I also suspect it was to justify their huge Reaganite tax cut proposal --- which was actually a huge windfall for the wealthy but was falsely and deceptively touted as a " tax relief " measure that would create a " trickle down " effect and be economically beneficial for everyone .
The horrendous result of Bush 's recession was that unemployment increased 40 percent in 2001 alone , a year after he gained the power of the presidency , and 2.4 Million jobs were lost between 2001 and 2004 during Bush 's first term .
So , Bush managed to pretty much match Reagan 's terrible deeds with the same results .
He made workers fear losing their jobs , and be more content with unsatisfactory wages and decreasing benefits .
And , while Republicans will vehemently deny that and claim I am simply ignorant of " economic realities , " the historic record and the facts clearly reveal the truth .
Reaganomics greatly benefits the wealthiest few , at the expense of the vast majority , and especially at the expense of the working poor and the poor .
For example , during fiscal years 2002 - 2004 , Bush succeeded in getting his tax cuts enacted , and they delivered about $ 197.3 Billion ( $ 197,300,000,000 ) in new tax breaks for the wealthiest one percent of Americans .
But those wealthiest few certainly did not need " tax relief , " as Bush called it .
Even the least wealthy of that wealthiest one percent had incomes of at least $ 337,000 per year .
Most of them had incomes in the multi-millions , and some even had incomes in the billions .
Therefore , Bush 's claim that they needed " tax relief " to relive their " tax burden " was a blatant lie designed to mislead and deceive 99 percent of the American people .
Bush deceptively claimed that his tax cuts were designed to benefit all of us .
Specifically , he said his tax cuts were to " put more of their own money in the pockets of all Americans . "
But while Bush 's tax cuts did give a few dollars to the majority of tax payers , they were actually designed and certainly served to make the rich much richer by allowing them to pay even far less taxes , when in all fairness they should have been paying and certainly can afford to pay much more , which would only be fair and equitable .
In America , Reaganite / Bushite policies and laws have produced increasing subsidies , tax loopholes , tax shelters and government giveaways which amount to " welfare for the rich , " and consequently the wealthiest few pay about 7 percent of their income in taxes .
In Western Europe the wealthiest few pay about 50 percent , which is only fair .
And it works well .
Most Europeans get from four to six weeks of paid vacation per year , free universal health care , free prenatal care , long maternity leaves , longer parental leave , free child care , and much longer sick leave than in America .
Furthermore , such benefits are guaranteed by the government .
They are not something that had to be fought for by labor unions , and the workers there do n't even have to collectively bargain for a lot of worker benefits .
By contrast , due to Reaganism ( and Bushism ) American businesses and corporations have been enabled to rake in record high profits while they cut workers benefits , health insurance , and even pensions .
America is going way backwards , while many other countries in the world are going forward because they realize that the better workers are treated , the better off everyone is .
And yet , in spite of that , George W. Bush has berated the European models , and said that America " does n't want to be like Europe . "
Apparently not .

HIEROGLYPHICS : AN INTRODUCTION
Special thanks to Neferkiki for this wonderful introduction
So you want to write like an Egyptian , huh ?
Well it took several years for aspiring scribes to learn how to do it , so for the sake of time we 'll just cover the basics .
Hieroglyphic writing is phonetic ...
That means symbols stand for certain sounds ( unlike the English alphabet where some letters have many sounds or can be silent ) .
Let 's start out with an example , the word freight .
While the F , R , and T sound the " normal " way , the G and H are silent and the E and I make one sound ( long A ) .
There are 7 letters in the word , but only 4 sounds ( F , R , long A , and T ) are heard .
So to spell freight with hieroglyphs , you 'd use the symbols for those 4 sounds :
Four different sounds are used to say " freight , " so four symbols -- no more , no less -- are needed to write it the Egyptian way .
Our spelling is more complicated than it needs to be .
Like , why do we spell phone with a PH when we have a perfectly good F just going to waste ?
And why bother with C when we already have K and S ?
Why have double letters ( like the M's in rummy ) when we only pronounce it once ?
And then there are words like knight , technique , and phlegm !
When you use hieroglyphs , you spell your words phonetically ( the way it sounds ) , so you leave out silent letters : height : the E , G , and second H are silent maybe : A and E are long , the Y is silent hey : the EY sounds like a long A Christmas : the CH sounds like K , the T is pretty much silent , and the A sounds more like a short I rogue : the U and E are silent saxophone : the X is really a KS sound , the PH is an F sound , and the E is silent Alone or in pairs , vowels stand for lots of different sounds .
And sometimes they 're silent .
When any English letter ( whether it's a vowel or a consonant ) is silent , do n't include a hieroglyph for it .
Some English sounds were n't spoken in ancient Egypt ...
English and ancient Egyptian are n't from the same language family , so some of the sounds they said do n't exist in our alphabet .
And some of the sounds we make did not exist in Egyptian .
For example , they did n't need a hieroglyph for the TH sound because they did n't say any words containing that sound .
You 'll notice in the chart at the bottom that some sounds ( like F and V ) that are different to us were n't distinguished by the ancient Egyptians , so we have to use the same hieroglyph .
Why F and V ?
Because these two sounds are articulated in roughly the same place in your mouth .
Try saying " ffffff " and then change it to " vvvvvv . "
See how changing the flow of air in your mouth makes a subtle difference in the sound ?
Vowels were often left out ...
The Egyptians often used only hieroglyphs for consonant sounds to write their words .
Thus , you can spell freight like this : F - R - T or But is that freight , fort , or feret ?
You have to look at the word in the context of the rest of the sentence to figure it out .
Or you could use a determinative ...
Q : If you leave out the vowels , what does ( G - S ) mean ?
Gus goose A : Either one .
We can't tell unless a determinative is written with the other hieroglyphs .
A determinative is a hieroglyph that has no sound .
It 's just there to give a clue to the meaning of the word .
Determinatives were tacked on to the ends of words to indicate its general meaning : goose Gus
The two determinatives above and the hieroglyphs listed below are just a few of the thousands that were used by ancient Egyptians .
Now you can understand why it took several years for a scribe to learn how to write !
But now you should be able to at least write your name .

Alternatively , she said , Florida and Michigan should hold new primary elections , probably in early June after the remaining primaries are completed and perhaps by statewide mail - in ballot .
She and her advisers believe she would do well in any revote and gain a major boost in delegates and momentum with two season - ending victories .
Mr. Obama , speaking on MSNBC Tuesday evening , ruled out any solution that accepts the January results .
“ We were told that Michigan and Florida would n’t count , and so we said we would n’t campaign there , ” Mr. Obama said .
“ Senator Clinton said the same thing , that they would n’t count .
Now her campaign is suggesting that they should . ”
Mrs. Clinton said last October that the Michigan primary was meaningless , but she left her name on the ballot .
Mr. Obama and the other major Democratic candidates removed their names from the ballot in a gesture of good faith to early - voting states whose primaries were officially allowed by the Democratic Party .
Neither candidate campaigned in Michigan ; Mrs. Clinton won with 55 percent of the vote over 40 percent for “ uncommitted ”
Mr. Obama ’s did not spell out his Plan B , but he said that any revote would be problematic , particularly if conducted by mail in Michigan and Florida , two states that have never conducted a mail - in election .
He said he would like to see the Michigan and Florida delegations seated in an “ equitable ” way , without spelling out what that would mean .
Obama advisers declined on Wednesday to say what a fair distribution of delegates would look like but have floated a plan to apportion the delegates 50 - 50 , wiping out any advantage that Mrs.
Clinton might have gained from the votes in January and essentially making the two states meaningless in the nomination fight .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The United States , which has the most prisoners of any country in the world , last year recorded the largest increase in the number of people in prisons and jails since 2000 , the Justice Department reported on Wednesday .

It said the nation ’s prison and jail populations increased by more than 62,000 inmates , or 2.8 percent , to about 2,245,000 inmates in the 12 - month period that ended on June 30 , 2006 .
It was the biggest jump in numbers and percentage change in six years .
Criminal justice experts have attributed the record U.S. prison population to tough sentencing laws , record numbers of drug offenders and high crimes rates .
State or federal prisons held two - thirds of the nation ’s incarcerated population while local jails held the rest , according to the report by the department ’s Bureau of Justice Statistics .
The number of inmates in state prisons rose by 3 percent , the report said .
That growth mainly reflected rising prison admissions , which have been going up faster than the number of released prisoners .
Also , more parole violators have returned to prison , the report said .
Forty - two states and the federal system all had more inmates in June last year than the previous year .
The number of jail inmates increased by 2.5 percent during the same 12 - month period , the report said .
The report on U.S. prison numbers is issued every six months .
Jason Ziedenberg of the Justice Policy Institute , a group that seeks alternatives to incarceration , said the new numbers showed an “ alarming growth ” in an already overburdened prison system .
“ Billions of public safety dollars are absorbed by prison expansion and limits the nation ’s ability to focus on more effective strategies to promote public safety , ” he said .
Officials at the Drug Policy Alliance , another group opposed to long prison sentences for drug offenders , said the drug policies of the past 30 years have been a major contributor to the U.S. prison population explosion .
According to the International Centre for Prison Studies at King ’s College in London , the United States has long had the world ’s largest prison population , followed by China at 1.5 million and Russia at 885,670 .
THQ's Michael Fitch places the blame for the closure of Titan Quest developer Iron Lore Entertainment , squarely on the shoulders of game pirates , though he does suggest that they may have had a bit of help from dumb players , hardware vendors , and one particularly stupid reviewer .
Fitch begins a lengthy ( and hopefully somewhat cathartic ) rant on the Quarter to Three forums by taking aim at those who feel justified pirating a PC game :
If even a tiny fraction of the people who pirated the game had actually spent some god - damn money for their 40 + hours of entertainment , things could have been very different today .
You can bitch all you want about how piracy is your god - given right , and none of it matters anyway because you can't change how people behave ... whatever .
Some really good people made a seriously good game , and they might still be in business if piracy were n't so rampant on the PC .
That 's a fact .
Bad enough that they were stealing the game to begin with , but players with cracked copies would sometimes complain that the game was buggy , apparently oblivious to the fact that what was crashing their game was Titan Quest 's copy protection protocols .
" Here we are ... getting bashed to hell and gone by people who can't even be bothered to actually pay for the game , " Fitch laments .
Fitch also takes a shot at hardware vendors who " make it harder all the time " to make a PC game .
The various combinations of components make " innumerable configurations that you can't possibly test against , " but no matter if it 's a CD / DVD drive with bad firmware , a video card issue , or conflicting drivers , " it 's always the game 's fault when something does n't work . "
Which leads us to the stupid players that earn Fitch 's ire .
" Do n't get me wrong , there 's a lot of very savvy people out there , " he says , but there are even more who do n't understand the basics of keeping their PC working , then blame the game when it does n't run properly .
" There are few better examples of the " it ca n't possibly be my fault " culture in the west than gaming forums , " writes Fitch .
One particular reviewer completely missed the teleport option in Titan Quest that would allow you to zap back to town whenever you liked , and was walking all the way back every time his inventory got full .
Naturally , such drudgery was reflected in his review .
" When we - and lots of our fans - pointed out that this was the reviewer 's fault , not the game 's , they amended the review .
But , they did n't change the score .
Do you honestly think that not having to run back to town all the time to sell your stuff would n't have made the game a better experience ? " asks Fitch .
Fitch is clearly very frustrated – and rightly so – by the obstacles and difficulties inherent in making PC games , but it 's difficult to see * Titan Quest ' *s problem as unique .
Given that game piracy and configuration difficulties seem to be particularly problematic for the PC gaming world , we have to wonder , would Iron Lore have survived if Titan Quest had been a console game ?

The Spotted Rose Snapper , which lives off the coast of California , is one of a handful of species of fish that are plagued by one of the strangest parasites in all of nature : Cymothoa exigua , a crustacean about the size of a fish ’s tongue when fully grown .
The young parasites invade their intended host fish by entering the gills .
Within the gills , the C. exigua all mature into males .
But these parasites are protoandritic hermaphrodites , meaning that the adult males can change to females⁠ — and in a fish infected with C. exigua , one of the invading crustaceans does exactly that .
The new female migrates through the innards of the fish into its mouth , and attaches herself to the tongue .
Next , she leeches blood from the fish ’s tongue until the muscle atrophies and falls off⁠ — hence the parasite ’s more commonly known name : the tongue - eating louse .
The parasite then uses its rear legs to clamps itself onto the withered tongue - stump , and effectively takes over as a replacement for the organ .
The parasite will spend the rest of its life there , living off the blood and / or mucus of the host fish , and occasionally mating with a male that visits from the gills .
Cymothoa exigua is the only parasite known to effectively replace an organ in their host ’s body .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The White House on Monday said Iran ’s rocket launch was “ unfortunate ” and would only further isolate Tehran from the international community .
Iran launched a rocket designed to send a research satellite into orbit , Iranian state television said .
The United States suspects Iran of trying to master technology to build nuclear weapons and has been pressing allies to isolate Tehran until it gives up its suspected nuclear ambitions .
Iran says its nuclear program is for civilian energy .
“ It ’s unfortunate Iran continues to test ballistic missiles .
This regime continues to take steps that only further isolate it and the Iranian people from the international community , ” White House spokesman Gordon Johndroe said .
Post columnist jokes :
What was Cheney trying to hide with that office fire ?
Nick Juliano
Published : Friday December 21 , 2007
del.icio.us |
Print This Email This Conspiratorial wheels started spinning in plenty of people 's minds this week when a fire broke out in Dick Cheney 's ceremonial offices .
The vice president is known for his penchant for secrecy , and between destroyed CIA tapes and missing e-mails , the government he helps run hardly lacks precedent for getting rid of potentially incriminating evidence .
For one Washington Post columnist , Wednesday 's fire sparked reminders of an abandoned plot from the Watergate era , when a young Cheney was cutting his teeth of government service .
" Arson might seem a bit far - fetched to folks outside the Beltway , but it would not be the first time a small conflagration was planned by a White House official , " writes Al Kamen Friday in his " In The Loop " column .
" We recall that Watergate burglary mastermind G. Gordon Liddy plotted firebombing the Brookings Institution -- ' as a diversion , ' he writes in his memoirs -- to get into the security vault and steal Daniel Ellsberg 's Vietnam War papers . "
Kamen recounts Liddy 's plan to spark a nighttime fire and then infiltrate Brookings ' headquarters with a crew of Cubans posing as firefighters , complete with their own bogus fire engine .
Liddy , who was then working for Richard Nixon 's re-election committee , wrote that his bosses quickly squashed the idea -- because the decoy fire truck would be too expensive .
As overseer of Nixon 's crew of " Plumbers , " whose goal was preventing damaging leaks , Libby did orchestrate the break - in at the office of Ellsberg 's psychiatrist , after Elsberg leaked the Pentagon Papers to the New York Times .
Most famously , Liddy was a key player in the burglary of Democratic National Committee offices at the Watergate hotel .
" And now we have this curious , possibly successful fire Wednesday .
So the obvious question is : What did they try to burn ? "
Kamen writes , presumably tongue in cheek .
" ( We 'll let the appropriate authorities find the perps . ) "
" Yes , it 's the final In the Loop Contest for 2007 , " he declares .
" Simply guess what documents or other materials the arsonists were trying to destroy .
Could it have been a secret legal opinion from Cheney Chief of Staff David Addington , giving the vice president the inherent authority to set the fire ? "
Contest details are here .
Newswise — Contrary to popular stereotypes assuming that areas undergoing immigration are associated with spiraling crime , a study published in the winter issue of the American Sociological Association 's Contexts magazine reveals that such areas experience lower violence .
Harvard University sociologist Robert Sampson examined crime and immigration in Chicago and around the United States to find the truth behind the popular perception that increasing immigration leads to crime .
Sampson 's article summarizes patterns from seven years ' worth of violent acts in Chicago committed by whites , blacks and Hispanics from 180 neighborhoods of varying levels of integration .
He also analyzed recent data from police records and the U.S. Census for all communities in Chicago .
Based on assumptions that immigrants are more likely to commit crimes and settle in poor , disorganized communities , prevailing wisdom holds that the concentration of immigrants and an influx of foreigners drive up crime rates .
However , Sampson shows that concentrated immigration predicts lower rates of violence across communities in Chicago , with the relationship strongest in poor neighborhoods .
Not only does immigration appear to be " protective " against violence in poverty areas , violence was significantly lower among Mexican - Americans compared to blacks and whites .
Sampson refers to this as the " Latino Paradox , " whereby Hispanic Americans do better on a range of social indicators — including propensity to violence — than one would expect , given their socioeconomic disadvantages .
Sampson 's analysis also revealed that first - generation immigrants were 45 percent less likely to commit violence than third - generation Americans .
Controlling for immigrant generation even narrowed the violence gap between whites and blacks in Chicago by 14 percent .
" The pattern of immigrant generational status and lower crime rates is not restricted to Latinos ; it extends to help explain white " black differences as well , " said Robert Sampson , who is the chair of Harvard 's sociology department .
" We 're so used to thinking about immigrant assimilation that we 've failed to fully appreciate how immigrants themselves shape their host society . "
Immigration is therefore not just a Hispanic issue ; although little noticed , increasing foreign - born diversity among blacks ( e.g. , from the West Indies and Africa ) is associated with lower crime even within segregated black communities .
Sampson 's arguments are supported at the national level as well .
Significant immigration growth — including by illegal aliens — occurred in the mid-1990s , peaking at the end of the decade .
During this time , the national homicide rate plunged .
Crime dropped even in immigration hot spots , such as Los Angeles ( where it dropped 45 percent overall ) , San Jose , Dallas and Phoenix .
Reasons commonly cited for the apparent paradox of first generation immigrants , especially Mexicans , are motivation to work , ambition and a desire not to be deported , characteristics that predispose them to low crime .
Sampson also argues that contemporary immigrants tend to come from a multitude of cultures around the world where violence is n't rewarded as a strategy for establishing reputation or preserving honor , as in American " street culture . "
" In today 's society , " Sampson hypothesizes , " immigration and the increasing cultural diversity that accompanies it generate the sort of conflicts of culture that lead not to increased crime but nearly the opposite . "

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Morgan Stanley MS.N said on Friday that Chairman and Chief Executive John Mack received $ 1.6 million in salary and other compensation last year , a big cut in pay for a disappointing performance marked by massive mortgage trading losses .
Including nearly $ 16.5 million in gains from the exercise last year of previously granted option and stock grants , Mack ’s total compensation was about $ 18 million last year .
According to the annual proxy , Mack received an $ 800,000 salary , but no annual bonus or stock awards for a year when the bank suffered $ 9.4 billion in losses from mortgage trading and other assets .
Profit fell 57 percent and the bank was prompted to sell a $ 5 billion stake to China .
Morgan Stanley first disclosed that Mack would not receive a bonus for 2007 in December , which it said was at his request .
Mack also received $ 399,153 in other compensation , including his use of company aircraft , expenses from repositioning aircraft , use of a company car and meals .
The value of Mack ’s pension and deferred compensation plans , meanwhile , increased by $ 391,844 last year .
The proxy shows that Mack received stock awards valued at $ 36.2 million and options valued at $ 4.02 million , in December 2006 , which is the first month of fiscal 2007 .
These awards plus the annual salary and “ other ” compensation brings Mack ’s total compensation received in fiscal 2007 to $ 41.4 million .
The stock awards and option grants , worth a combined $ 40.2 million , were awarded for his 2006 performance , a strong year for the world ’s second - largest securities firm .
Morgan Stanley reported in December that profit for its fiscal year ending November 30 fell to $ 3.21 billion from $ 7.47 billion a year earlier , hurt by losses tied to subprime mortgages and other debt .
Last year , Mack realized $ 8.02 million in gains from exercising 207,331 options and $ 8.43 million from realizing restricted stock awards .
As of November 30 , Mack also held exercisable options for 941,803 shares , unexercisable options on 210,252 shares and restricted stock units worth $ 59.7 million at the end of November .

Drivers stopped for speeding - or even for failing to wear a seatbelt - could soon be placed on the ' Big Brother ' DNA database for life .
The most trivial offences , such as dropping litter , would also lead to samples being taken under sweeping new powers which police are demanding .
The samples would stay on the database , alongside those of murderers and rapists , even if the people involved were later cleared of any wrongdoing .
Campaigners condemned the plan as a step too far which could affect someone 's job prospects for many years .
Under current rules , a person can have his or her DNA and fingerprints taken only if stopped for a ' recordable ' offence - a crime serious enough to carry a jail term .
Minor offences such as allowing a dog to foul the footpath are excluded .
But police - backed by the Crown Prosecution Service - want to take DNA samples , fingerprints and even imprints of footwear for all offences .
They argue that , just because a person initially commits a low - level misdemeanour such as dog fouling , it does not mean they will not progress to the gravest crimes .
A chance to take their DNA - making any future crime far easier to solve - would be missed without new powers .
Police also want to take samples - usually a mouth swab - at the scene of the " crime " .
They say having to take offenders to the police station , as happens now , is too " bureaucratic " .
The Home Office suggested the new powers to police in a consultation document earlier this year .
Ministers are now under pressure to confirm the change .
There are already four million samples on the database - including those of a million suspects who turned out to be innocent .
Helen Wallace of GeneWatch UK said last night : ' There is significant potential for the loss of public trust in extending the taking and use of biometrics .
They pose a serious threat to individual privacy and are unlikely to be an effective way to tackle crime .
" Any attempt to take DNA samples outside a police station is clearly unworkable . "
Sonia Andrews of the Magistrates ' Association said : ' We would find it difficult to justify extending the ability to take biometric data to cover nonrecordable offences . '
The Information Commissioner 's Office warned of the danger of people being turned down for jobs if checks reveal details of minor offences committed many years ago .
Under the current system records of such offences are deleted after time .
But if they are tagged to a DNA sample on the database they could remain ' active ' .
But the idea is backed by police across the country , according to consultation responses published yesterday .
Inspector Thomas Huntley , of the Ministry of Defence Police , said failing to take samples ' could be seen as giving the impression that an individual who commits a nonrecordable offence could not be a repeat offender .
" While the increase of suspects on the database will lead to an increased cost , this should be considered as preferable to letting a serious offender walk from custody . "
Pete Hutin , of Sussex Police , said the " taking of DNA samples in custody is unnecessarily bureaucratic " .
David Evans , of the CPS , argued that the move would allow a ' more comprehensive database ' .
The Home Office said : ' The DNA database has revolutionised the way the police can protect the public through identifying offenders and securing more convictions .
" The database provides police with , on average , over 3,500 matches each month and in 2005 - 6 alone led to matches against 422 homicides , 645 rapes , 1,974 other violent crimes and over 9,000 domestic burglaries .
" The consultation is about maximising police efficiency and ensuring that appropriate and effective safeguards are in place .
No decisions have yet been made and any detailed proposals will be subject to a further public consultation next year . "
The police demand was revealed as the Human Genetics Commission , the Government 's independent DNA watchdog , launched an inquiry into the database .
Panels across the country will gather evidence on public opinion .
NEW YORK / TOKYO ( Reuters ) - Lehman Brothers LEH.N was fleeced out of more than $ 355 million in a fraud the U.S. investment bank believes was perpetrated by two employees at Japanese trading house Marubeni Corp. 8002.T , according to a person briefed on the matter .
The Lehman Brothers headquarters is seen in New York January 30 , 2008 .

The fraud may have hit other financial institutions as well , according to the source , who spoke on condition of anonymity .
If Lehman ’s arguments are true , the scamsters perpetrated one of the more sophisticated corporate con jobs since Enron set up a fake trading floor to impress analysts .
Lehman believes the scam included forged documents and an imposter .
Lehman is trying to recover a loan to a fund headed by Asclepius Ltd -- a now - bankrupt unit of LTT Bio-Pharma Co 4566.T. Lehman had believed the money , supposedly to be used to finance medical leases , was backed by Marubeni .
The bank believes Marubeni is now shirking its obligations to pay back the partnership between Lehman , Marubeni and the fund , the person told Reuters .
Marubeni , which fired the two employees on March 10 , said the two employees may have been manipulated by the former president of Asclepius , that Marubeni had not approved the leases and that police are working on the case .
The employees were contractors , spokesman Hirokazu Iwashima said , adding that there was “ no involvement by Marubeni as a company . ”
Lehman plans to sue Marubeni , spokesmen in Tokyo and New York said .
They declined to say how much money it had put into the business or elaborate on what exactly the former Marubeni employees did .
“ We are confident in our legal claim which we will pursue until we receive repayment from Marubeni , ” said Matthew Russell , Lehman Brothers head of Corporate Communications , Asia -Pacific , in a statement sent to Reuters .
The person briefed in the matter told Reuters that two former Marubeni employees -- Shingo Yamaura and Takuro Nitahara -- convinced Lehman to help finance what it understood were Marubeni ’s equipment leases and supply contracts with hospitals .
Lehman gave the partnership money in advance to fund initial leases and contracts .
When Lehman sought payment under its deal on Feb 29 , 2008 , Marubeni said the seals on the contracts had been forged , and refused payment , according to the person briefed on the matter .
Marubeni declined comment on Lehman ’s statements , and said it could not give information on people no longer with the trading house or comment on ongoing investigations .
Yamaura and Nitahara were not able to be reached for comment .
Before agreeing to fund the venture , Lehman asked to meet the Marubeni general manager involved .
The man Lehman employees met was an imposter , Lehman believes , the source said .
Lehman said in a statement on Saturday , “ Lehman Brothers Japan Inc. today confirmed that it is working closely with the authorities to seek full recovery of funds it believes to have been fraudulently misappropriated from transactions in which an affiliate provided financing . ”
LTT Bio-Pharma officials were not available for comment .
The company announced on March 19 that bankruptcy proceedings filed by Asclepius were approved by the Tokyo District Court and also announced that Asclepius was suspected of being involved in illegal dealings .
Kyodo News said Asclepius dismissed its then - president on March 7 .
A spokesman at the Metropolitan Police Agency declined to comment on ongoing investigations .

Hey man , I do n't know that stuff
Stevey 's talking aboooooout
If my boss thinks it 's important
I 'm gonna get fiiiiiiiiiired
Oooh yeah baaaby baaaay - beeeeee ....
you 're having an off day one or more of your interviewers is having an off day there were communication issues invisible to you and / or one or more of the interviewers you got unlucky and got an Interview Anti-Loop
I 've been meaning to write up some tips on interviewing at Google for a good long time now .
I keep putting it off , though , because it 's going to make you mad .
Probably .
For some statistical definition of " you " , it 's very likely to upset you .
Why ?
Because ... well , here , I wrote a little ditty about it : I did n't realize this was such a typical reaction back when I first started writing about interviewing , way back at other companies .
Boy - o - howdy did I find out in a hurry .
See , it goes like this : blah blah blah , I like asking question X in interviews , blah blah blah ... Question X ? Oh man , I have n't heard about X since college !
I 've never needed it for my job !
He asks that in interviews ?
But that means someone out there thinks it 's important to know , and , and ... I do n't know it !
If they detect my ignorance , not only will I be summarily fired for incompetence without so much as a thank - you , I will also be unemployable by people who ask question X !
If people listen to Stevey , that will be everyone !
I will become homeless and destitute !
For not knowing something I 've never needed before !
This is horrible !
I would attack X itself , except that I do not want to pick up a book and figure enough out about it to discredit it .
Clearly I must yell a lot about how stupid Stevey is so that nobody will listen to him !
So in conclusion , blah blah ... huh ?
Did you say " fired " ?
" Destitute ? "
What are you talking about ?
Aaaaaaauuuggh !!!
* stab* * stab* * stab * That 's it .
I 'm never talking about interviewing again .
It does n't matter what X is , either .
It 's arbitrary .
I could say : " I really enjoy asking the candidatein interviews " , and people would still freak out , on account of insecurity about either interviewing in general or their knowledge of their own name , hopefully the former .
But THEN , time passes , and interview candidates come and go , and we always wind up saying : " Gosh , we sure wish that obviously smart person had prepared a little better for his or her interviews .
Is there any way we can help future candidates out with some tips ?
" And then nobody actually does anything , because we 're all afraid of getting stabbed violently by People Who Don't Know X.I considered giving out a set of tips in which I actually use variable names like X , rather than real subjects , but decided that in the resultant vacuum , would get upset .
Otherwise that approach seemed pretty good , as long as I published under a pseudonym .
In the end , people really need the tips , regardless of how many feelings get hurt along the way .
So rather than skirt around the issues , I 'm going to give you a few mandatory substitutions for X along with a fair amount of general interview - prep information .
This blog is not endorsed by Google .
Google does n't know I 'm publishing these tips .
It 's just between you and me , OK ?
Do n't tell them I prepped you .
Just go kick ass on your interviews and we 'll be square .
I'm only talking about general software engineering positions , and interviews for those positions .
These tips are actually generic ; there 's nothing specific to Google vs. any other software company .
I could have been writing these tips about my first software job 20 years ago .
That implies that these tips are also timeless , at least for the span of our careers .
These tips obviously wo n't get you a job on their own .
My hope is that by following them you will perform your very best during the interviews .
Oho !
Why Google , you ask ?
Well let 's just have that dialog right up front , shall we ?
Should I work at Google ?
Is it all they say it is , and more ?
Will I be serenely happy there ?
Should I apply immediately ?
Yes .
To which ques ... wait , what do you mean by " Yes ? "
I did n't even say who I am !
Dude , the answer is Yes .
( You may be a woman , but I 'm still calling you Dude . )
But ... but ... I am paralyzed by inertia !
And I feel a certain comfort level at my current company , or at least I have become relatively inured to the discomfort .
I know people here and nobody at Google !
I would have to learn Google 's build system and technology and stuff !
I have no credibility , no reputation there – I would have to start over virtually from scratch !
I waited too long , there 's no upside !
I 'm afraaaaaaid !DUDE .
The answer is Yes already , OK ?
It 's an invariant .
Everyone else who came to Google was in the exact same position as you are , modulo a handful of famous people with beards that put Gandalf 's to shame , but they 're a very tiny minority .
Everyone who applied had the same reasons for not applying as you do .
And everyone here says : " GOSH , I SURE AM HAPPY I CAME HERE ! "
So just apply already .
But prep first .
But what if I get a mistrial ?
I might be smart and qualified , but for some random reason I may do poorly in the interviews and not get an offer !
That would be a huge blow to my ego !
I would rather pass up the opportunity altogether than have a chance of failure !
Yeah , that 's at least partly true .
Heck , I kinda did n't make it in on my first attempt , but I begged like a street dog until they gave me a second round of interviews .
I caught them in a weak moment .
And the second time around , I prepared , and did much better .
The thing is , Google has a well - known false negative rate , which means we sometimes turn away qualified people , because that 's considered better than sometimes hiring unqualified people .
This is actually an industry - wide thing , but the dial gets turned differently at different companies .
At Google the false - negative rate is pretty high .
I do n't know what it is , but I do know a lot of smart , qualified people who 've not made it through our interviews .
It 's a bummer .
But the really important takeaway is this : if you do n't get an offer , you may still be qualified to work here .
So it need n't be a blow to your ego at all !
As far as anyone I know can tell , false negatives are completely random , and are unrelated to your skills or qualifications .
They can happen from a variety of factors , including but not limited to : Yes , I 'm afraid you have to worry about this .
What is it , you ask ?
Well , back when I was at Amazon , we did ( and they undoubtedly still do ) a LOT of soul - searching about this exact problem .
We eventually concluded that every single employee E at Amazon has at least one " Interview Anti-Loop " : a set of other employees S who would not hire E .
The root cause is important for you to understand when you 're going into interviews , so I 'll tell you a little about what I 've found over the years .
First , you can't tell interviewers what 's important .
Not at any company .
Not unless they 're specifically asking you for advice .
You have a very narrow window of perhaps one year after an engineer graduates from college to inculcate them in the art of interviewing , after which the window closes and they believe they are a " good interviewer " and they do n't need to change their questions , their question styles , their interviewing style , or their feedback style , ever again .
It 's a problem .
But I 've had my hand bitten enough times that I just do n't try anymore .
Second problem : every " experienced " interviewer has a set of pet subjects and possibly specific questions that he or she feels is an accurate gauge of a candidate 's abilities .
The question sets for any two interviewers can be widely different and even entirely non-overlapping .
A classic example found everywhere is : Interviewer A always asks about C++ trivia , filesystems , network protocols and discrete math .
Interviewer B always asks about Java trivia , design patterns , unit testing , web frameworks , and software project management .
For any given candidate with both A and B on the interview loop , A and B are likely to give very different votes .
A and B would probably not even hire each other , given a chance , but they both happened to go through interviewer C , who asked them both about data structures , unix utilities , and processes versus threads , and A and B both happened to squeak by .
That 's almost always what happens when you get an offer from a tech company .
You just happened to squeak by .
Because of the inherently flawed nature of the interviewing process , it 's highly likely that someone on the loop will be unimpressed with you , even if you are Alan Turing .
Especially if you 're Alan Turing , in fact , since it means you obviously do n't know C++.
The bottom line is , if you go to an interview at any software company , you should plan for the contingency that you might get genuinely unlucky , and wind up with one or more people from your Interview Anti-Loop on your interview loop .
If this happens , you will struggle , then be told that you were not a fit at this time , and then you will feel bad .
Just as long as you do n't feel meta - bad , everything is OK .
You should feel good that you feel bad after this happens , because hey , it means you 're human .
And then you should wait 6 - 12 months and re-apply .
That 's pretty much the best solution we ( or anyone else I know of ) could come up with for the false - negative problem .
We wipe the slate clean and start over again .
There are lots of people here who got in on their second or third attempt , and they 're kicking butt .
You can too .
Good !
So let 's get on to those tips , then .
If you 've been following along very closely , you 'll have realized that I 'm interviewer D. Meaning that my personal set of pet questions and topics is just my own , and it 's no better or worse than anyone else 's .
So I can't tell you what it is , no matter how much I 'd like to , because I 'll offend interviewers A through X who have slightly different working sets .
Instead , I want to prep you for some general topics that I believe are shared by the majority of tech interviewers at Google - like companies .
Roughly speaking , this means the company builds a lot of their own software and does a lot of distributed computing .
There are other tech - company footprints , the opposite end of the spectrum being companies that outsource everything to consultants and try to use as much third - party software as possible .
My tips will be useful only to the extent that the company resembles Google .
So you might as well make it Google , eh ?
First , let 's talk about non-technical prep .
Nobody goes into a boxing match cold .
Lesson : you should bring your boxing gloves to the interview .
No , wait , sorry , I mean : warm up beforehand !
How do you warm up ?
Basically there is short - term and long - term warming up , and you should do both .
Long - term warming up means : study and practice for a week or two before the interview .
You want your mind to be in the general " mode " of problem solving on whiteboards .
If you can do it on a whiteboard , every other medium ( laptop , shared network document , whatever ) is a cakewalk .
So plan for the whiteboard .
Short - term warming up means : get lots of rest the night before , and then do intense , fast - paced warm - ups the morning of the interview .
The two best long - term warm - ups I know of are : 1 ) .
Why ?
Because it is the most likely to help you beef up on problem identification .
Many interviewers are happy when you understand the broad class of question they 're asking without explanation .
For instance , if they ask you about coloring U.S. states in different colors , you get major bonus points if you recognize it as a graph - coloring problem , even if you do n't actually remember exactly how graph - coloring works .
And if you do remember how it works , then you can probably whip through the answer pretty quickly .
So your best bet , interview - prep wise , is to practice the art of recognizing that certain problem classes are best solved with certain algorithms and data structures .
My absolute favorite for this kind of interview preparation is Steven Skiena 's The Algorithm Design Manual .
More than any other book it helped me understand just how astonishingly commonplace ( and important ) graph problems are – they should be part of every working programmer 's toolkit .
The book also covers basic data structures and sorting algorithms , which is a nice bonus .
But the gold mine is the second half of the book , which is a sort of encyclopedia of 1 - pagers on zillions of useful problems and various ways to solve them , without too much detail .
Almost every 1 - pager has a simple picture , making it easy to remember .
This is a great way to learn how to identify hundreds of problem types .
Other interviewers I know recommend Introduction to Algorithms .
It 's a true classic and an invaluable resource , but it will probably take you more than 2 weeks to get through it .
But if you want to come into your interviews prepped , then consider deferring your application until you 've made your way through that book .
2 ) The friend should ask you a random interview question , and you should go write it on the board .
You should keep going until it is complete , no matter how tired or lazy you feel .
Do this as much as you can possibly tolerate .
I did n't do these two types of preparation before my first Google interview , and I was absolutely shocked at how bad at whiteboard coding I had become since I had last interviewed seven years prior .
It 's hard !
And I also had forgotten a bunch of algorithms and data structures that I used to know , or at least had heard of .
Going through these exercises for a week prepped me mightily for my second round of Google interviews , and I did way , way better .
It made all the difference .
As for short - term preparation , all you can really do is make sure you are as alert and warmed up as possible .
Do n't go in cold .
Solve a few problems and read through your study books .
Drink some coffee : it actually helps you think faster , believe it or not .
Make sure you spend at least an hour practicing immediately before you walk into the interview .
Treat it like a sports game or a music recital , or heck , an exam : if you go in warmed up you 'll give your best performance .
So !
You 're a hotshot programmer with a long list of accomplishments .
Time to forget about all that and focus on interview survival .
You should go in humble , open - minded , and focused .
If you come across as arrogant , then people will question whether they want to work with you .
The best way to appear arrogant is to question the validity of the interviewer 's question – it really ticks them off , as I pointed out earlier on .
Remember how I said you can't tell an interviewer how to interview ?
Well , that 's especially true if you 're a candidate .
So do n't ask : " gosh , are algorithms really all that important ?
do you ever need to do that kind of thing in real life ?
I 've never had to do that kind of stuff . "
You 'll just get rejected , so do n't say that kind of thing .
Treat every question as legitimate , even if you are frustrated that you do n't know the answer .
Feel free to ask for help or hints if you 're stuck .
Some interviewers take points off for that , but occasionally it will get you past some hurdle and give you a good performance on what would have otherwise been a horrible stony half - hour silence .
Do n't say " choo choo choo " when you 're " thinking " .
Do n't try to change the subject and answer a different question .
Do n't try to divert the interviewer from asking you a question by telling war stories .
Do n't try to bluff your interviewer .
You should focus on each problem they 're giving you and make your best effort to answer it fully .
Some interviewers will not ask you to write code , but they will expect you to start writing code on the whiteboard at some point during your answer .
They will give you hints but wo n't necessarily come right out and say : " I want you to write some code on the board now . "
If in doubt , you should ask them if they would like to see code .
Interviewers have vastly different expectations about code .
I personally do n't care about syntax ( unless you write something that could obviously never work in any programming language , at which point I will dive in and verify that you are not , in fact , a circus clown and that it was an honest mistake ) .
But some interviewers are really picky about syntax , and some will even silently mark you down for missing a semicolon or a curly brace , without telling you .
I think of these interviewers as – well , it 's a technical term that rhymes with " bass soles " , but they think of themselves as brilliant technical evaluators , and there 's no way to tell them otherwise .
So ask .
Ask if they care about syntax , and if they do , try to get it right .
Look over your code carefully from different angles and distances .
Pretend it 's someone else 's code and you 're tasked with finding bugs in it .
You'd be amazed at what you can miss when you 're standing 2 feet from a whiteboard with an interviewer staring at your shoulder blades .
It 's OK ( and highly encouraged ) to ask a few clarifying questions , and occasionally verify with the interviewer that you 're on the track they want you to be on .
Some interviewers will mark you down if you just jump up and start coding , even if you get the code right .
They 'll say you did n't think carefully first , and you 're one of those " let 's not do any design " type cowboys .
So even if you think you know the answer to the problem , ask some questions and talk about the approach you 'll take a little before diving in .
On the flip side , do n't take too long before actually solving the problem , or some interviewers will give you a delay - of - game penalty .
Try to move ( and write ) quickly , since often interviewers want to get through more than one question during the interview , and if you solve the first one too slowly then they 'll be out of time .
They 'll mark you down because they could n't get a full picture of your skills .
The benefit of the doubt is rarely given in interviewing .
One last non-technical tip : bring your own whiteboard dry -erase markers .
They sell pencil - thin ones at office supply stores , whereas most companies ( including Google ) tend to stock the fat kind .
The thin ones turn your whiteboard from a 480i standard - definition tube into a 58 - inch 1080 p HD plasma screen .
You need all the help you can get , and free whiteboard space is a real blessing .
You should also practice whiteboard space - management skills , such as not starting on the right and coding down into the lower - right corner in Teeny Unreadable Font .
Your interviewer will not be impressed .
Amusingly , although it always irks me when people do this , I did it during my interviews , too .
Just be aware of it !
Oh , and do n't let the marker dry out while you 're standing there waving it .
I 'm tellin ' ya : you want minimal distractions during the interview , and that one is surprisingly common .
OK , that should be good for non -tech tips .
On to X , for some value of X !
Do n't stab me !
The best tip is : go get a computer science degree .
The more computer science you have , the better .
You do n't have to have a CS degree , but it helps .
It does n't have to be an advanced degree , but that helps too .
However , you 're probably thinking of applying to Google a little sooner than 2 to 8 years from now , so here are some shorter - term tips for you . : you need to know Big - O .
It 's a must .
If you struggle with basic big - O complexity analysis , then you are almost guaranteed not to get hired .
It 's , like , one chapter in the beginning of one theory of computation book , so just go read it .
You can do it . : know how to sort .
Do n't do bubble - sort .
You should know the details of at least one n* log ( n ) sorting algorithm , preferably two ( say , quicksort and merge sort ) .
Merge sort can be highly useful in situations where quicksort is impractical , so take a look at it .
For God 's sake , do n't try sorting a linked list during the interview . : hashtables are arguably the single most important data structure known to mankind .
You absolutely have to know how they work .
Again , it 's like one chapter in one data structures book , so just go read about them .
You should be able to implement one using only arrays in your favorite language , in about the space of one interview . : you should know about trees .
I 'm tellin ' ya : this is basic stuff , and it 's embarrassing to bring it up , but some of you out there do n't know basic tree construction , traversal and manipulation algorithms .
You should be familiar with binary trees , n- ary trees , and trie - trees at the very very least .
Trees are probably the best source of practice problems for your long - term warmup exercises .
You should be familiar with at least one flavor of balanced binary tree , whether it 's a red / black tree , a splay tree or an AVL tree .
You should actually know how it 's implemented .
You should know about tree traversal algorithms : BFS and DFS , and know the difference between inorder , postorder and preorder .
You might not use trees much day - to - day , but if so , it 's because you 're avoiding tree problems .
You wo n't need to do that anymore once you know how they work .
Study up !
Graphs are , like , really really important .
More than you think .
Even if you already think they 're important , it 's probably more than you think .
There are three basic ways to represent a graph in memory ( objects and pointers , matrix , and adjacency list ) , and you should familiarize yourself with each representation and its pros and cons .
You should know the basic graph traversal algorithms : breadth - first search and depth - first search .
You should know their computational complexity , their tradeoffs , and how to implement them in real code .
You should try to study up on fancier algorithms , such as Dijkstra and A* , if you get a chance .
They 're really great for just about anything , from game programming to distributed computing to you name it .
You should know them .
Whenever someone gives you a problem , think graphs .
They are the most fundamental and flexible way of representing any kind of a relationship , so it 's about a 50 - 50 shot that any interesting design problem has a graph involved in it .
Make absolutely sure you can't think of a way to solve it using graphs before moving on to other solution types .
This tip is important !
You should study up on as many other data structures and algorithms as you can fit in that big noggin of yours .
You should especially know about the most famous classes of NP - complete problems , such as traveling salesman and the knapsack problem , and be able to recognize them when an interviewer asks you them in disguise .
You should find out what NP - complete means .
Basically , hit that data structures book hard , and try to retain as much of it as you can , and you can't go wrong .
Some interviewers ask basic discrete math questions .
This is more prevalent at Google than at other places I 've been , and I consider it a Good Thing , even though I 'm not particularly good at discrete math .
We 're surrounded by counting problems , probability problems , and other Discrete Math 101 situations , and those innumerate among us blithely hack around them without knowing what we 're doing .
Do n't get mad if the interviewer asks math questions .
Do your best .
Your best will be a heck of a lot better if you spend some time before the interview refreshing your memory on ( or teaching yourself ) the essentials of combinatorics and probability .
You should be familiar with n- choose - k problems and their ilk – the more the better .
I know , I know , you 're short on time .
But this tip can really help make the difference between a " we 're not sure " and a " let 's hire her " .
And it 's actually not all that bad – discrete math does n't use much of the high - school math you studied and forgot .
It starts back with elementary - school math and builds up from there , so you can probably pick up what you need for interviews in a couple of days of intense study .
Sadly , I do n't have a good recommendation for a Discrete Math book , so if you do , please mention it in the comments .
Thanks .
This is just a plug , from me , for you to know about processes , threads and concurrency issues .
A lot of interviewers ask about that stuff , and it 's pretty fundamental , so you should know it .
Know about locks and mutexes and semaphores and monitors and how they work .
Know about deadlock and livelock and how to avoid them .
Know what resources a processes needs , and a thread needs , and how context switching works , and how it 's initiated by the operating system and underlying hardware .
Know a little about scheduling .
The world is rapidly moving towards multi-core , and you 'll be a dinosaur in a real hurry if you do n't understand the fundamentals of " modern " ( which is to say , " kinda broken " ) concurrency constructs .
The best , most practical book I 've ever personally read on the subject is Doug Lea 's Concurrent Programming in Java .
It got me the most bang per page .
There are obviously lots of other books on concurrency .
I 'd avoid the academic ones and focus on the practical stuff , since it 's most likely to get asked in interviews .
You should know at least one programming language really well , and it should preferably be C++ or Java .
C# is OK too , since it 's pretty similar to Java .
You will be expected to write some code in at least some of your interviews .
You will be expected to know a fair amount of detail about your favorite programming language .
Because of the rules I outlined above , it 's still possible that you 'll get Interviewer A , and none of the stuff you 've studied from these tips will be directly useful ( except being warmed up . )
If so , just do your best .
Worst case , you can always come back in 6 - 12 months , right ?
Might seem like a long time , but I assure you it will go by in a flash .
The stuff I 've covered is actually mostly red-flags : stuff that really worries people if you do n't know it .
The discrete math is potentially optional , but somewhat risky if you do n't know the first thing about it .
Everything else I 've mentioned you should know cold , and then you 'll at least be prepped for the baseline interview level .
It could be a lot harder than that , depending on the interviewer , or it could be easy .
It just depends on how lucky you are .
Are you feeling lucky ?
Then give it a try !
I 'll probably batch up any resume submissions people send me and submit them weekly .
In the meantime , study up !
You have a lot of warming up to do .
Real - world work makes you rusty .
I hope this was helpful .
Let the flames begin , etc .
Yawn .
There 's only one wordtoyour.com domain .
Once purchased , it may never become available again .
Do you check every item you buy to make sure it is green and planet - friendly ?
Do you buy carbon offsets every time you fly ?
Stop .
It is time to be honest : green consumerism is at best a draining distraction , and at worst a con .
While the planet 's fever gets worse by the week , we are guzzling down green - coloured placebos and calling it action .
There is another way .
Our reaction to global warming has gone in waves .
First we were in blank denial : how can releasing an odourless , colourless gas change the climate so dramatically ?
Now we are in a phase of displacement : we assume we can shop our way out of global warming , by shovelling a few new lightbulbs and some carbon offsets into our shopping basket .
This is a self - harming delusion .
It 's hard to give a sense of the contrast today between the magnitude of our problem , and the weediness of our response so far .
But the best way is offered by the Nobel Prize - winning scientist Paul Crutzen .
He explains that until 10,000 years ago , the planet 's climate would fluctuate violently : sometimes it would veer by 12 degrees centigrade in just a decade .
This meant it was impossible to develop agriculture .
Crops could n't be cultivated in this climatic chaos , so human beings were stuck as a tiny smattering of hunter - gatherers .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
But then the climate settled down into safe parameters – and humans could settle down too .
This period is called the Holocene , and it meant that for the first time , we could develop farming and cities .
Everything we know as human civilisation is thanks to this unprecedented period of climatic stability .
Today , we are bringing this era to an end .
By pumping vast amounts of warming gases into the atmosphere , we are creating a new era : the Anthropocene , in which man makes the weather .
There is an imminent danger of it bursting beyond these safe parameters , and bringing about a return to the violent , volatile variations that prevented our ancestors from progressing beyond spears and sticks .
Those are the stakes .
Every week , there is greater evidence that we are nudging further from our safety zone .
The hottest year of the 20th century – 1947 – is now merely the average for the 21st century .
And what are we doing ?
Many good , well - intentioned people are beginning to grasp this problem – and then assuming green consumerism is the only answer to hand .
They shop around for items that have not been freighted thousands of miles to make it to their supermarket shelves .
They change their lightbulbs .
They turn down the thermostat a few degrees .
They make sure they buy products that do n't sit on electricty - burning standby all day .
They buy the more energy - efficient cars , and scorn SUV drivers .
I do n't want to attack these people .
They are an absolutely essential part of any solution .
But we have to be honest .
This is not even the beginning of a solution – and by pouring so much energy into it , we may actually be forestalling the real solution .
I know a huge number of people who are sincerely worried about global warming , but they assume they have Done Their Bit through these shifted consumption patterns .
The truth is : you have n't .
In reality , dispersed consumer choices are not going to keep the climate this side of a disastrous temperature rise .
The only way that can ever happen is by governments legislating to force us all – green and anti-green – to shift towards cleaner behaviour .
Just as the government in the Second World War did not ask people to eat less voluntarily , governments today cannot ask us to burn fewer greenhouse gases voluntarily .
It is not enough for you to change your bulbs .
Everyone has to change their bulbs .
It is not enough for you to eat less meat .
Everyone has to eat less meat .
It is not enough for you to fly less .
Everyone has to fly less .
( And yes , I hate these facts as much as you do .
But I will hate the reality of runaway global warming even more . )
The only way we will get to the situation where we are all required by law to burn fewer greenhouse gases is if enough people pressure the government , demanding it .
Green consumer choices often drain away people 's political energies to do this .
You have a limited amount of time to spend on any political cause .
If you have an hour a week to dedicate to acting on global warming , and you spend it scouring the supermarket shelves for the product shipped the shortest distance , that time and energy is gone ; you feel you 've done what you can .
Part of you might also assume : I 've made these choices ; other people will too ; in time , we 'll all be persuaded .
But we do n't have time .
There is a much better way for you to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere .
Every minute you would have spent shopping around for a greener choice , you should spend volunteering for Greenpeace , or Friends of the Earth , or Plane Stupid , or the Campaign Against Climate Change .
Every hundred - pound premium you would spend to buy a greener product , donate it to them instead .
Why ?
Because by becoming part of this collective action – rather than by clinging to dispersed personal choices – you will help to change the law , so everyone will have to be greener , not just nice people like you .
It works .
Green campaigners from Australia to Canada to Japan have successfully banned the old lightbulbs , so only the energy - saving lightbulbs are on offer there now .
Green campaigners have prompted the Mayor of London to force SUV drivers to pay a punitive £ 6,000 - a- year premium to drive through our city , forcing many of them to shift to greener cars .
These are the first tiny steps towards banning – or massively restricting – the other technologies that are unleashing Weather of Mass Destruction .
Of course , some sincere and well - intentioned people have libertarian concerns about this approach at first glance .
Why should we force people to choose the green option ?
Is n't it better to rely on persuasion and voluntary choice ?
But even the most hardcore libertarians agree that your personal liberty ends where you actively harm the liberty of another person .
Greenhouse gas emissions are undeniably harming tens of millions of people – and endangering the ground on which all human liberty rests : a stable and safe climate .
Just as no libertarian would argue you should have the right to buy and fire a nuclear weapon , no libertarian should argue you have the right to burn unlimited greenhouse gases .
Once confronted with this argument , the only people who cling to a libertarian defence of fossil fuels are people who take money from the fossil fuel industry itself , like Spiked Online .
They have to scrape together any old excuse .
So enough with the placebos .
Enough with the fake - libertarian excuses .
As the climate that sustains human life unravels around us , we are long past the moment when we need real medicine – and the only one we have is hard government legislation .

Rep. Peter King :
There are " too many mosques in this country ”
New York Rep. Peter King , a prominent House Republican , said there are “ too many mosques in this country ” in a recent interview with Politico .
“ There are too many people sympathetic to radical Islam , ” King said .
“ We should be looking at them more carefully and finding out how we can infiltrate them . ”
King is the ranking Republican on the House Homeland Security Committee .
And as an outspoken advocate of strong anti-terror measures , he has been unafraid to ruffle some feathers in his drive to protect the homeland .
When asked to clarify his statement , King did not revise his answer , saying “ I think there has been a lack of full cooperation from too many people in the Muslim community . ”
The interview was for a profile of the committee , as part of Politico ’s Committee Insider Series .
Earlier , King had said in an interview with radio and television host Sean Hannity that 85 percent of the mosques in this country are controlled by “ extremist leadership , ” a comment that prompted strong condemnations from many religious organizations and from the Democratic National Committee .
UPDATE : On Wednesday , the congressman said : “ The quote was taken entirely out of context by Politico .
My position in this interview , as it has been for many years , is that too many mosques in this country do not cooperate with law enforcement .
Unfortunately , Politico was incapable of making this distinction . ”
UPDATE 2 : After Congressman King said his comment was taken out of context , Politico posted a fuller video so readers can decide .

On the Internet , news travels quickly , and when the Asian news site Pacific Epoch posted a small news story about a Chinese Massively Multiplayer Online Role - Playing Game ( MMORPG ) called King of the World freezing the accounts of " male players who chose to play female in - game characters , " the word spread like wildfire .
Gaming sites all over the Internet ran with the story , and online outrage ran wild as gamers everywhere debated the validity of forcing virtual characters to have the same gender as their real - life players .
But was the story even true in the first place ?
Every site that reported on it either linked to other sites that had picked it up or referred to the original Pacific Epoch post .
That post mentioned a company called Aurora Technology , which it claimed was a subsidiary of Chinese media firm Shandra Entertainment .
So far , so good : Shandra did indeed purchase Aurora Technology in July of this year .
According to Pacific Epoch , the game in question is called King of the World .
Thanks to the magic of Google , attempting to search for this game brings up only stories that linked to the original Pacific Epoch post , a dizzying and frustrating exercise in online circular logic .
However , Shandra Entertainment does have a web site , and on that site they helpfully list the MMORPG properties that the company currently owns and operates .
The list is as follows : The Legend of Mir II , The World of Legend , The Sign , The Age , Magical Land , RO , D.O. , and Dungeons & Dragons Online .
Nowhere in the list does King of the World appear .
Could the game be a property of Aurora Technology that for some reason does n't show up in Shandra 's official lists ?
At the time of acquisition two months ago , Aurora operated only two MMORPGs : Feng Yun Online and Legend Online .
However , a little more digging did uncover a post from Chinese gaming news web site 17173.com stating that King of the World Online did in fact enter an open beta on August 22 .
If the number 17173 sounds familiar , it should : the site ( reverse the digits to get the joke ) is listed in the original Pacific Epoch story as being the source for the news about King of the World account freezes .
Oddly , however , neither 17173's English - language site nor a Google - translated version of their Chinese site mentions the gender restrictions issue anywhere .
Could 17173 simply be playing an elaborate joke on the English - speaking Internet , or do they know something that nobody else seems to ?
Going back to the Pacific Epoch news story , it maintained that players in King of the World would have to " prove their biological sex with a webcam . "
This seems rather unlikely given the ease of cheating such a system and the fact that it would require all players to have a web cam installed .
The game 's current beta status also makes the story somewhat questionable : who freezes out accounts during a beta test ?
Still , the idea is not beyond the realm of possibility : other Asian MMORPGs such as MapleSEA ( Maple Story South East Asia ) require players to select their gender when creating an account , and afterwards they can only create characters that are of the same gender .
Ars Technica attempted to contact Shandra Entertainment to either confirm or deny the story , but so far we have received no response .
GLASS : It 's nice to be here ; I do n't get out much any more .
As to my inventiveness ...
The true mastermind of the Federal Reserve banking system was Woodrow Wilson ... , but many others made constructive contributions ...
REGION : ... The Federal Reserve has been dismantling the Glass - Steagall Act 's walls between commercial and investment banks .
As one of the architects of those walls , do you regret the changes ?
GLASS : If you put yourself in my place and time , you would have done as I did .
Our subcommittee did not act out of any prejudice or in a whimsical or inadequate way .
We consulted practical bankers and experts extensively .
We did everything but sleep with experts , and we learned that national banks had created affiliates as a way of doing precisely those things that the National Bank Act prohibited them from doing ... , affiliates were the slippery conjurations of lawyers .
Shrewd men operated them and entwined the parent banks in great difficulties .
Banks lent their names , prestige and tradition of sound banking operations to these affiliates , and on that basis did people invest and transact business with them .
When calamity struck , not all bankers felt a responsibility to the citizens they had enticed .
Not all bankers could afford to .
Our subcommittee heard testimony about many virtuous affiliates , but we also heard of abuses , especially in securities dealings , and the weight of informed opinion was that the affiliate system was riddled with vicious practices .
Two of the country 's most eminent bankers who testified had already got rid of their affiliates without any governmental prompting , but opinion varied about whether affiliates should be liquidated , or whether they should be separated from the commercial banks , or whether their powers should be trimmed and they should be subjected to more or less severe supervision , as banks were .
We could not single out exceptional cases .
Congress must act by general legislation , and in the end we aimed for a happy medium .
We allowed a decent period for banks and their securities affiliates to uncouple , and we subjected other affiliates to greater or lesser safeguards and supervision , depending on their activities .
We hoped those measures would answer the public 's loss of confidence , protect depositors and investors , and help prevent Federal Reserve facilities from being used in support of stock and commodity gambling , which had brought on the Depression and about which I had been warning for 14 years or more ...
REGION : ... The insurance of S&L deposits put the government to great expense not long ago .
...
GLASS : " Great expense " is a tepid description of a catastrophe .
The best reform of government insurance would be to wash the land entirely clean of it , though it take all the waters of Abanah and Pharpar to do it .
If it were not so tragic , it might be amusing how many people discovered the problem of moral hazard only after the savings and loan associations went bust .
When we passed the Federal Reserve Act , we knew all about moral hazard .
One version of our currency bill would have devoted half the Reserve banks ' excess earnings to deposit guaranty , but every plan that experts and politicians devised was either a sham or would have visited the sins of reckless banks either upon the government or upon banks that themselves bore no taint of wickedness or improvidence , and would thus encourage sin .
No one ever proposed a solution to that problem that satisfied me , or has yet .
When I stood before the House of Representatives in 1913 and declared that not one dollar of government funds should ever go toward the guaranty of bank deposits , the welkin rang with applause from both sides of the aisle .
REGION : But surely the government bears a responsibility .
Bank failures impose calamitous losses on individuals who are not well positioned to protect themselves .
GLASS : In my experience , once a man learns that he is at risk , he will find a way to protect himself .
And there is no better learning experience than to see his neighbor lose a portion of his deposits in a panic .
...
President Wilson , the best educated president we have ever had in political philosophy , deplored philanthropic government , but the country has grown accustomed to it .
Protecting citizens against loss is a philanthropic goal , but as we predicted in 1913 , the national government cannot keep bank losses at a tolerable level , once it has shifted risk to itself — or , rather , to its taxpayers — without a mammoth and expensive bureaucracy to dictate banking practices in ever more minute and oppressive detail to experienced and practical bankers .
I am more persuaded than I ever was that the government should not be in this business .
REGION : That confuses me .
Is n't your name on the bill that put the government in this business ?
GLASS : A legislator may sponsor a bill for different reasons ... ; and in emergencies he may support emergency measures that are unsuited to calmer times .
It was clear that the country needed prompter and more orderly arrangements for liquidating banks .
A man wrote me from Missouri , for example , that his bank had been six years in the hands of a manipulative receiver and he had not seen one cent of his money .
I also recall a Montana bank whose affairs could not be wound up in under 28 years .
Those problems deserved legislative correction .
REGION : It 's too bad you needed a banking crisis to get that legislation .
GLASS : It is nearly impossible to get banking reformation in this country without a crippling national emergency , and even then , bankers tell us to wait for better times because their situation is precarious and reform will break them .
But when better times arrive , they tell us to wait yet awhile , because reform will upset their fragile prosperity .
Bankers and their myrmidons and hired pigwidgins always threaten a torrent of disasters .
They think the time is always right to reform others and the time is always wrong to reform them .
Furthermore , if Congress waits as bankers instruct and gives some new villainy time to take hold and become familiar , bankers then defend the practice as if it were a birthright of finance handed down to them from Justinian by way of the Medicis and Alexander Hamilton himself , with which it would be impious and disruptive for the government to interfere .
In this fog of selfish rhetoric , all a poor member of Congress can do is keep a list of needed improvements and bide his time until a financial catastrophe gives him his chance , and then he must legislate at once or wait for the next debacle .
This is a wasteful , unscientific process .
It delays useful remedies until the banking system is racked with infection , and it brings in desperate cure - alls , quack nostrums and overdoses that may be worse than the disease and , though meant to be temporary , often continue for decades after the fever breaks .

Many analysts think US home prices will fall further in 2008
The Mortgage Bankers Association data showed the failing loans rate was led by an increasing number of sub - prime borrowers unable to make payments .
A record 0.83 % of loans entered the foreclosure process .
The delinquency rate , of missed payments , was 5.82 % .
Pending home sales saw no change in January , a small glimmer of stability .
The price decline we have already experienced is helping to restore the housing market towards equilibrium
Richard Dekaser , National City Corporation
The index , compiled by the National Association of Realtors , measures deals where a buyer has signed a contract but the sale is yet to be closed .
It is a key measure of future home sales activity , which is why the unchanged figure - coming after a 1.5 % fall in the previous month - is being seen a potentially positive sign .
' Downward pressure '
" Given the state of the housing market , it 's simply encouraging not to see further deterioration , " said Richard Dekaser , chief economist at National City Corporation of Cleveland , Ohio .
" It 's pretty consistent with home sales bottoming out , but I do n't want to overstate it . "
Meanwhile , the rate of failing loans increased across most mortgage types , particularly in the sub - prime borrowers .
" Foreclosures are adding to the supply of unsold homes and that 's putting downward pressure on prices , " said Mr Dekaser .
" In my view , it portends more price decline in 2008 .
The price decline we have already experienced is helping to restore the housing market towards equilibrium . "
Equity - release
Meanwhile , the Federal Reserve says the percentage of equity Americans have in their homes has fallen below 50 % for the first time since 1945 .
Homeowners ' share of home equity fell to 47.9 % in the in the fourth quarter of 2007 .
The percentage of debt people still own on their properties now represents more than half its value .
This could be because of people taking out large mortgages on more expensive properties , of because of equity - release loans increasing in recent years .
Recession fear
The weakness in the US housing sector has led some analysts to fear that the economy is heading for a recession .
Many analysts have predicted that prices will continue to fall in 2008 as builders struggle to sell a glut of new properties , many of them coming on to the market as a result of foreclosures .
The worry is that falling home prices and higher mortgage repayment costs will lead to an increase in home repossessions .
This in turn could constrain US consumer spending , which in turn could cause the US economy to contract .
The minutes showed policy makers debated last month whether it needed more evidence that the economy had been damaged by the housing slump and market turmoil before deciding to cut rates .
The policy decision was a " close call , " the minutes released Tuesday said .
Still , investors and strategists believe the central bank may have to reduce the benchmark lending rate further from its current 4.50 percent level to prevent the economy from stalling .
" Whether it happens tonight or at the next meeting , the Fed looks set to cut rates , " said Michael Malpede , a senior currency strategist , at Man Global Research in Chicago .
" I think that means the euro is probably headed to $ 1.50 by year end . "
If you 've been to Greece on holiday , you might remember sun-kissed beaches .
But THIS was the scene in the capital Athens at the weekend .
Check out this view of the 2,400 - year - old buildings on Acropolis hill in central Athens .
Temperatures plummeted to minus 15 degrees in some areas .
The country was gripped by a winter storm , which left a blanket of snow in many regions .
About 200 villages in the island of Crete were cut off .
A view of the Acropolis 's famous Parthenon temple .
People are used to visiting these famous sights in blazing sunlight !
Dozens of flights in the capital , Athens , were cancelled and problems with power and water supplies were reported .
Many vehicles remained parked up because the weather conditions made driving too tricky .
But this motorcyclist was determined to make his trip past the Greek Parliament .
Forget shorts and T - shirts .
It was all about wrapping up warm for people who were brave enough to take a walk in the Halandri area of Athens .

Giving a Spammer the run-around
This past February I got an email from a spammer named Peter Wong trying to con me out of money .
I decided to reply and see what would happen .
I pretended to act interested and gave him the run around for almost a full month .
It ended with me sending him dirty pictures that he assumed was my account information .

Updated | 12:30 a.m .
The revolution , it seems , will be televised .
Or at least streamed live over the Web .
On the 234th anniversary of the Boston Tea Party , the Ron Paul revolution — or re-love - ution , as his supporters call it — drew some of Mr. Paul ’s acolytes to a snowy gathering in Boston on Sunday for the real world complement to what was mainly an online fund - raising blitz .
Supporters of Mr. Paul , the Republican congressman from Texas , are hoping to top their fund - raising extravaganza last month , when they took in more than $ 4 million for the campaign .
That effort was pegged to Guy Fawkes Day , which commemorates the attempted assassination of King James I by a British mercenary on Nov. 5 , 1605 .
Though Mr. Paul has said he is not sure how to spend the war chest he has already amassed , his supporters rolled out another fund - raising event , this one linked to America ’s own revolution .
The event was heavily promoted , and by midnight Sunday more than $ 6 million in donations had rolled in , according to The Associated Press .
The goal for the day was $ 10 million .
Hundreds of supporters also braved the weather for a rally at Faneuil Hall , where they heard speeches promoting Mr. Paul ’s libertarian vision , which calls for , among other things , abolishing the income tax .
For those who could not make it in person , the campaign streamed live video of the event , which included a speech by the candidate ’s son , Dr. Rand Paul .
GUANTANAMO BAY U.S. NAVAL BASE , Cuba ( Reuters ) - A Canadian accused of killing a U.S. soldier in Afghanistan should not be tried as a war criminal because he was a child soldier for al Qaeda , too young to voluntarily join its forces , his military defense lawyer told a U.S. war court on Monday .
Undated family photo of Omar Khadr , who is being detained by U.S. forces at Guantanamo Bay .
REUTERS / Handout / Files
Navy Lt. William Kuebler asked a military judge to throw out the charges against Canadian defendant Omar Khadr , who was shot and captured at age 15 in a firefight at a suspected al Qaeda compound in Afghanistan in 2002 .
“ He is a victim of al Qaeda , not a member of al Qaeda , ” Kuebler said .
Khadr is the Toronto - born son of an alleged al Qaeda financier .
He is accused of throwing a grenade that killed U.S. Army Sgt. 1st Class Christopher Speer in the firefight and planting roadside bombs intended to kill other U.S. or coalition soldiers in Afghanistan .
Khadr is charged in the Guantanamo war court with murder , attempted murder , conspiring with al Qaeda , providing material support for terrorism and spying by conducting surveillance of U.S. military convoys in Afghanistan .
He faces life in prison if convicted .
Kuebler argued that U.S. and international law assume that children involved in an armed conflict are not there voluntarily , because they lack the experience and judgment to understand the risk of joining armed forces .
Defense attorneys contend that any charges against Khadr should be pursued in a civilian court in a juvenile system where the goal is rehabilitation rather than punishment .
If the U.S. Congress intended to try children as war criminals , it would have explicitly authorized that in the 2006 law that serves as a framework for the Guantanamo court , Kuebler said .
But a U.S. Department of Justice attorney , arguing for the prosecution , said that if Congress intended to exclude juveniles from the Guantanamo war court , it would have explicitly written that , because lawmakers knew Khadr could face charges .
Instead , Congress wrote the law using the term “ person , ” which legally refers to “ anyone born alive , ” Justice Department attorney Andy Oldham said .
LAST WESTERNER
Khadr is the last citizen of a Western nation among the 275 captives being held at Guantanamo as part of the Bush administration ’s war on terrorism .
Charges are now pending against five of the Guantanamo prisoners .
The Pentagon plans to try about 80 of them .
But six years after the detention camp opened , only one captive has been convicted in Guantanamo ’s widely criticized tribunal system and that was through a plea deal .
Khadr sat quietly during the hearing , clad in a white tunic and trouser uniform signifying that he complies with camp rules .
In his more than five years at Guantanamo , the once pimply faced boy has grown into a 21 - year - old man with a short , bushy beard .
The judge , Army Col .
Peter Brownback , did not indicate when he would rule on the request to drop the charges .
The case is scheduled for trial in May , though Kuebler said it probably would be delayed .
The court released documents describing the battle in which Khadr was captured .
U.S. forces entered the suspected al Qaeda compound after an aerial bombing and were fired upon with a rifle and with the grenade that killed Speer , it said .
An unidentified witness , who is apparently a member of the U.S. armed forces , said he found two wounded people still alive inside -- a man lying near an AK - 47 assault rifle , whom he shot in the head and killed , and Khadr , who was seated on the ground facing away .
The witness said he shot Khadr twice in the back and that Khadr replied repeatedly in English , “ Kill me . ”
Khadr was instead given medical treatment and sent to Guantanamo .
Last week we reported on the release of Steal This Film 2 , a documentary about the past , present and future of filesharing .
The film is free to download , but people are encouraged to donate some money if they want to support future projects .
Surprisingly , the pirates who decided to donate were quite generous .
Steal This Film 2 is produced by “ The League of Noble Peers ” .
Part 2 is already a great success with over 150,000 downloads in the first 4 days .
Interestingly , people are being very generous with their donations , which have already passed $ 5000 .
When Part 1 was released , “ The League of Noble Peers ” asked downloaders to donate $ 1 ( or more ) if they wanted to support the project .
Unsurprisingly , the vast majority donated just that .
However , for the new release the majority donated $ 15 or more .
Why ?
Well it could be that donators were motivated by a mystery gift they were offered when they gave more than $ 15 , but there are alternative explanations as to why pirates may be more generous than people assume .
Jamie King , producer of the film gives the following explanation on his blog : “ Over 90 % of people donating are deciding to go over the artificial $ 15 threshold we set .
But I do n’t think people literally ‘ want that gift ’ ; I think they want an excuse to be generous ! ”
This could be true , the people who donate ( still only a small percentage ) are obviously dedicated to the cause , but there is more .
It could also be that they donate more because they now do n’t have an excuse to donate only $ 1 , even pirates do n’t want to look miserly .
Most importantly perhaps , is that it shows that it can be wise to avoid psychological reactance , and leave the choice about what to donate or spend on a film or a music album up to the consumer .
It is a challenge to build business models around free will and free content , but the Steal This Film project shows that there are opportunities .
Another interesting point raised by Jamie in his post is the need for alternative payment models .
Sure , PayPal works but they take away too much money – it ’s replacing one money sucking middleman with another .
Take the Radiohead release for example , you could get the album virtually for free , but you still had to pay the credit card company nearly $ 1 .
This is probably why most people decided to pirate the album , instead of getting it for “ free ” .
It seems that The Pirate Bay agrees on this , as they are working on a p2 p based payment model that will probably be released by the and of this month .
TorrentFreak briefly talked to Brokep about this upcoming project a while ago , unfortunately we are not allowed to give you any more details , but it ’s certainly an interesting project with a lot of potential .
Brokep did reveal a bit on Jamie ’s blog as he said : “ I think that people will pay if there ’s a simple solution .
The payment solutions of today are not built for the new , network economy â€ ” they ’re built around the old one .
As we move away from the old economy , we ’re here without a new payment solution . ”
We will definitely keep you informed on this upcoming project .
BitTorrent opens up possibilities for independent filmmakers .
Distribution costs are now non-existent , and new business models are slowly starting to emerge .
The future of film making looks bright and will be in part funded and formed by the innovators who were once called pirates .
Masturbation ’s bad rap can be dated with surprising accuracy .
Around 1712 , a short , anonymous pamphlet called Onania began to circulate around the 2,000 - odd coffee houses of London , published by the private press of one P. Varenne .
Little did anyone know it would become history ’s most successful advertorial .
The pamphlet made the sensational claim that masturbation was responsible for a whole range of illnesses — from headaches to rheumatism , short - sightedness , bowel disorders , and gonorrhea — and that , left unrestrained , the habit would inevitably lead to a lonely and agonizing death .
Up until this time , the world had been blissfully indifferent to the health risks of self - pleasuring ; the habit elicited a few tut - tuts from the Church , but it was considered an insignificant and harmless vice .
In fact , doctors since the Roman Galen had argued that the retention of sperm by males was physically dangerous and that females could also avoid hysteria and madness through auto — erotic release .
But thanks to Onania , “ self - abuse ” would now and for centuries afterward be identified as European society ’s most pernicious public health threat , a cancer that was eating away at the bodies of its youth .
In the best tradition of pop medicine , Onania identified both the disease and its instant cure : Concerned parents were advised to buy two miracle drugs from the publisher at the sign of the Seneca ’s Head pub – “ Strengthening Tincture ” and “ Prolific Powder . ”
It comes as no surprise to learn that these medicines , which would deaden any dangerous nocturnal urges , were rapaciously expensive at 10 shillings a bottle and 12 shillings a bag , respectively .
( The price of about 300 cups of coffee at the time . )
The identity of Onania ’s creator remained a mystery until 2002 , when Berkeley scholar Thomas W. Laqueur traced the authors who had worked with the publisher Varenne before and fingered the unsavory London quack John Marten ( 1670 - 1737 ) .
This shadowy figure was a self - educated surgeon and medical huckster who had been clapped in irons for obscenity over a fanciful book on venereal diseases .
Emerging undaunted from prison , he evidently knocked out his magnum opus Onania at the age of 42 .
( Marten took his title from the Biblical figure Onan , who “ spills his seed on the ground ” instead of procreating with his wife and is struck dead by a vengeful God.
Although Onan ’s sin might well have been coitus interruptus , or the withdrawal method , the pamphleteer insisted it was really masturbation . )
Marten must have been a little surprised to find he had penned a bestseller ; London was already flooded with pseudo - scientific claptrap , but his work tapped into 18th - century fears that the unbridled imagination , especially among children , could become a destructive force .
He quickly expanded Onania into an 88 - page tract , padded with soft - porn “ testimonials ” from readers that seemed mostly to involve attractive young women feverishly pleasuring themselves .
Typical was the report from distraught parents of a comely village girl who had taken to self - abuse while alone on the farm at age 14 , fell ill , then turned into a nymphomaniac .
The harlot evidently died in hysterics at age 19 from an infected “ gland ” in her clitoris .
It was a winning formula .
Onania went into 28 editions and was widely translated in Europe .
The first pirated U.S. edition came out in 1724 in Boston , where an enterprising printer named John Philips lifted the text and sold it — no doubt along with the tincture — from a shop in his town house ; a copy worked its way into the Monticello library of Thomas Jefferson , amongst other high places .
In London , Onania stayed in print for 75 years , but its bleak influence would last far longer , provoking guilt and hypochondria for the next two centuries .
In 1760 , the celebrated Swiss doctor Samuel Tissot expanded on Marten ’s ideas in his hugely successful book L’Onanisme , arguing that semen is “ an essential oil ” — one precious ounce is worth 40 ounces of blood , with terrible effects on the body if wasted — and that young women were in just as much danger from the deadly disease of “ vulvovaginitis ” as young men were from “ spermatorrhea . ”
The fear of self - abuse provoked hysteria well into the early 20th century and produced some relics still with us today : Both graham crackers and the cereal Corn Flakes — concocted in 1894 by frenzied anti-masturbation campaigner , John Harvey Kellog ( 1853 - 1943 ) — were invented as a non-stimulating foodstuff to reduce the sex drives of the young .

The continuous fabrication of complex , three - dimensional nanoscale structures and the ability to grow individual nanowires of unlimited length are now possible with a process developed by researchers at the University of Illinois .
Based on the rapid evaporation of solvent from simple “ inks , ” the process has been used to fabricate freestanding nanofibers , stacked arrays of nanofibers and continuously wound spools of nanowires .
Potential applications include electronic interconnects , biocompatible scaffolds and nanofluidic networks .
“ The process is like drawing with a fountain pen – the ink comes out and quickly dries or ‘ solidifies , ’ ” said Min-Feng Yu , a professor of mechanical science and engineering , and an affiliate of the Beckman Institute .
“ But , unlike drawing with a fountain pen , we can draw objects in three dimensions . ”
Yu and graduate students Abhijit Suryavanshi and Jie Hu describe the drawing process in a paper accepted for publication in the journal Advanced Materials , and posted on its Web site .
To use the new process , the researchers begin with a reservoir of ink connected to a glass micropipette that has an aperture as small as 100 nanometers .
The micropipette is brought close to a substrate until a liquid meniscus forms between the two .
As the micropipette is then smoothly pulled away , ink is drawn from the reservoir .
Within the tiny meniscus , the solute nucleates and precipitates as the solvent quickly evaporates .
So far , the scientists have fabricated freestanding nanofibers approximately 25 nanometers in diameter and 20 microns long , and straight nanofibers approximately 100 nanometers in diameter and 16 millimeters long ( limited only by the travel range of the device that moves the micropipette ) .
To draw longer nanowires , the researchers developed a precision spinning process that simultaneously draws and winds a nanofiber on a spool that is millimeters in diameter .
Using this technique , Yu and his students wound a coil of microfiber .
The microfiber was approximately 850 nanometers in diameter and 40 centimeters long .
To further demonstrate the versatility of the drawing process , for which the U. of I. has applied for a patent , the researchers drew nanofibers out of sugar , out of potassium hydroxide ( a major industrial chemical ) and out of densely packed quantum dots .
While the nanofibers are currently fabricated from water - based inks , the process is readily extendable to inks made with volatile organic solvents , Yu said .
“ Our procedure offers an economically viable alternative for the direct - write manufacture of nanofibers made from many materials , ” Yu said .
“ In addition , the process can be used to integrate nanoscale and microscale components . ”

Forty years on , and " My Lai " is synonymous with " massacre " .
504 people were killed by US soldiers in the My Lai massacre
The killing of Iraqi civilians at Haditha has often been referred to as a modern - day My Lai .
The name is shorthand for slaughter of the defenceless , the benchmark of American wartime atrocity .
The murders of 504 men , women , children and babies happened in a northerly province of South Vietnam on 16 March 1968 .
It proved to be a turning point for public opinion about the Vietnam War .
Yet , most of what we know about the event comes from a single , widely publicised court martial in 1970 - 71 .
A young Lieutenant - William Calley - in Charlie Company was tried and convicted of murdering 22 " oriental human beings " in My Lai on that sunny morning in 1968 .
Forgotten tapes
Media attention on Lt Calley 's trial was extensive and the glare of publicity so bright it hid the wider , more awful truth .
Before that trial got under way , the United States army had , behind closed doors , completed an investigation of its own into the events at My Lai , and specifically into the possibility that those in authority had deliberately covered up a massacre .
ARCHIVE HOUR : MY LAI TAPES
Lt General Peers Dennis Bunning testimony
Convened on 1 December 1969 in the basement of the Pentagon , The Department of the Army Review of the Preliminary Investigations into The My Lai Incident , known in abbreviated form as The Peers Inquiry , was chaired by Lt Gen William ' Ray ' Peers .
In just 14 weeks , the Peers Inquiry conducted a comprehensive and wide - ranging investigation into the events of 16 March .
More than 400 witnesses were interviewed , and their testimony was tape - recorded .
When the inquiry concluded on 15 March 1970 , those recordings were boxed - up , stored and forgotten .
That day it was just a massacre .
Just plain right out , wiping out people
Leonard Gonzales
Testimony to the Peers Inquiry
In 1987 , they were shipped to the US National Archives , as one small portion of a massive group of records of US Army activities in Vietnam .
There they remained hidden , never catalogued , never investigated , never uncovered - until last year .
I spent many months trying to track down the tapes .
Again and again , I was told they did not exist , but after much persistence , 48 hours of recordings from the key witnesses were declassified and made available to me .
And on 15 March , on the eve of the 40th anniversary of the massacre , some of the most powerful testimony will be broadcast for the first time , on the Archive Hour on BBC Radio 4 .
Some of the interviewees ' statements reveal the mentality of the soldiers involved in the massacre .
" I would say that most people in our company did n't consider the Vietnamese human ...
A guy would just grab one of the girls there and in one or two incidents they shot the girls when they got done , " said Dennis Bunning .
" That day it was just a massacre .
Just plain right out , wiping out people , " said Leonard Gonzales .
" Kill everything "
The wider , more awful truth that Gen Peers uncovered , was that this was an illegal operation , planned and co-ordinated at Task Force level by Lt Col Frank Barker .
It wiped out not one but three villages : My Lai , Binh Tay and My Khe .
And not one , but two companies were involved : Bravo and Charlie .
Both of these companies were given the same briefing by their respective commanding officers , permitting them " to kill everything and anything . "
" It 's not just the people of Task Force Barker that are on trial ...
It 's the Army , it 's you and it 's me ... and it includes our country and our people in the eyes of the world , " said Gen Peers , during his investigation .
He concluded that 30 senior officers had been negligent in their duty .
After the inquiry , 14 officers were charged with crimes .
Ha Thi Quy , a survivor of the massacre , remembers the dead
But the only participant convicted of anything at My Lai was Lt William Calley .
Gen Peers also proposed new methods of training soldiers , guidelines for the treatment of civilians in wartime and new army leadership criteria .
His recommendations still influence today 's army training manuals .
" The My Lai Tapes " are a record not only of atrocity writ large but also of heroism .
They are a record of how war can bring out not only the worst but also the best in people .
Above all they are a record of lessons learned 40 years ago , in My Lai , Binh Tay and My Khe - lessons that should not be forgotten .
Celina Dunlop is picture editor of the Economist .
The Archive Hour : The My Lai Tapes will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 at 2000 GMT on Saturday , 15 March , 2008 .
You can also listen online for seven days after that at Radio 4 's Listen again page .
biblical prophecy would have no say in public policy .
In our world , Hagee gets a spot on Glenn Beck 's CNN show , talking about whether or not Barack Obama is the anti-Christ .
View the video here .
I thought the " Obama is a closet - Muslim " was the be-all and end - all of stupidity this campaign season .
I guess I 'm still young and na�ve .
Then again , I lived to vote through the " John Kerry is a War Criminal " campaign , so it 's all relative .
Glenn Beck is an entertainer , and has no more credibility than someone like Tom Green , Pauly Shore , or Sean Hannity .
He makes a living the same way George Bush became president , playing the " I 'm stupid , just like you ; do n't you want your average Squidbilly telling you how to think , since they will back up what you 're already thinking ? " card .
Like Bush , he 's an ex-addict who made a 180 degree turn after he found the Lord .
Excuse me for not being impressed .
Beck has consistently called FDR evil , he wrote a book on global warming denial , thinks ugly women are " progressive " , referred to John Edwards as a " communist " .
And so on .
In today 's America , where the dollar is more important than the truth , radio - host Michael Savage can call Barbara Walters a " slut " as long as it ups his ratings .
Rush Limbaugh can call a 13 year old Chelsea Clinton a " dog " as long as he gets a laugh from his 72 - and - under IQ audience .
Because it 's not about the truth .
It 's about perception .
Consider the fact that 20 percent of Americans think the sun revolves around the earth .
We 're being played like never before .
With 24 - hour news cycles , pundits run out of things to talk about , so they resort to repeating administration talking points and reciting rumors if it gets people to tune in .
Everyone on CNN and Fox News and MSNBC is a character with a gimmick .
It 's like watching professional wrestlers with their shirts on .
The made - up female reporters showing off their cleavage seem about as informed as a WWE ring girl .
In a rational world , Reverend Hagee would have no say on public matters , because no one would pay attention to someone who called Hurricane Katrina " the judgment of God against the city of New Orleans [ because ] there was to be a homosexual parade there on the Monday that the Katrina came . "
He has also referred to the Catholic Church as " the great whore . "
Our media culture has become the modern - day circus freakshow .
When people got tired of the bearded lady , they focused their attention on a closeted - drug addict spouting rumors about our ex-president murdering people .
Of course , when Limbaugh was questioned on his antics , the right changed the subject and spawned " the media is unfair to us " self - pity Phony Outrage to expand the boundaries of their lies .
Some people head over to Coney Island to see a guy with facial tattoos swing weights from his nipples .
Some watch John Cena body - slam Mankind .
Others get their fix listening to Sean Hannity talk matter - of - factly about a suicide mission to keep Nancy Pelosi out of power .
And there 's Ann Coulter wishing terrorists had blown up the New York Times building .
It 's hard to believe political appeal and ideas in our pundit media are generated through banality , stupidity , and absurdity .
But look at where we 've come .
Ayn Rand used to top best - seller lists .
Now Dan Brown does .
Video games are marketed toward adults .
FDR used to give 45 - minute Fireside chats , which 75 percent of the country tuned in to .
Now our presidential candidates are reduced to ten - second sound bites and ridiculed for not putting on the same American flag plumage pin worn by such American hypocrites as Tom Delay and Larry Craig .
No wonder they were able to trick us into buying duct tape to fend off the Sesame Street terror alerts .
As per above , when Beck actually asked Reverend Hagee if Barack Obama is the " anti-Christ " � you know , since Hagee is an expert on the subject ... and there is such a subject �
Hagee answered , " No " before reemphasizing his support of John McCain .
In a rational world , this endorsement would sink McCain 's campaign .
Luckily for McCain , 20 percent of America thinks the sun revolves around the earth .

Are people meant to be monogamous or is it an outdated societal expectation ?
News of politicians ' and celebrities ' extramarital affairs never seem to be in short supply .
But if humans were cut from exactly the same cloth as other mammals , a faithful spouse would be an unusual phenomenon .
Only 3 percent to 5 percent of the roughly 5,000 species of mammals ( including humans ) are known to form lifelong , monogamous bonds , with the loyal superstars including beavers , wolves and some bats .
Social monogamy is a term referring to creatures that pair up to mate and raise offspring but still have flings .
Sexually monogamous pairs mate with only with one partner .
So a cheating husband who detours for a romantic romp yet returns home in time to tuck in the kids at night would be considered socially monogamous .
Beyond that , scientists ' definitions for monogamy vary .
Evolutionary psychologists have suggested that men are more likely to have extramarital sex , partially due to the male urge to " spread genes " by broadcasting sperm .
Both males and females , these scientists say , try to up their evolutionary progress by seeking out high - quality mates , albeit in different ways .
The committed partnership between a man and a woman evolved , some say , for the well - being of children .
" The human species has evolved to make commitments between males and females in regards to raising their offspring , so this is a bond , " said Jane Lancaster , an evolutionary anthropologist at the University of New Mexico .
" However that bond can fit into all kinds of marriage patterns – polygyny , single parenthood , monogamy . "
The human species is somewhat unique amongst mammals in that fathers do invest in raising children .
" We do know that in humans we do have this pretty strong pair bond , and there 's more paternal investment than in most other primates , " said Daniel Kruger , a social and evolutionary psychologist at the University of Michigan 's School of Public Health .
" We 're special in this regard , but at the same time like most mammals , we are a polygynous species . "
Kruger said humans are considered " mildly polygynous , " in which a male mates with more than one female .
Whether or not the married or otherwise committed individuals stray for sex depends on the costs and benefits .
" There is plenty of evidence that males have less to lose than females by having extramarital sex , " Lancaster said .
" Having less to lose , it 's easier for them to do it . "
Women , however , could lose " dad 's " resources when it comes to raising their kids .
" For women , the well - being of their children is not improved by promiscuity , " Lancaster told LiveScience .
Some scientists view both social and sexual monogamy in humans as a societal structure rather than a natural state .
" I do n't think we are a monogamous animal , " said Pepper Schwartz , a professor of sociology at the University of Washington in Seattle .
" A really monogamous animal is a goose – which never mates again even if its mate is killed . "
She added , " Monogamy is invented for order and investment – but not necessarily because it's ' natural . ' "

While there is a certain grand mystery to some aspects of human behavior , others can be easily explained .
Just find yourself a garden - variety house cat , along with a $ 10 laser pointer .
Many cat owners know that the lasers are the easiest way to keep the pet amused .
The cats will ceaselessly , maniacally chase it as it's beamed about the room , literally climbing the walls to capture what they surely regard as some form of ultimate prey .
Obviously , cats are hard - wired to hunt down small , bright objects , like birds .
But since nothing in nature is as bright as a laser , they are powerless to resist its charms .
Cats and lasers are useful in explaining some of the more addictive aspects of Web use , including a recent occurrence on the site for Andrew Sullivan , a popular political blogger .
Mr. Sullivan 's blog does n't follow the standard practice of making room for readers to add their own comments after each blog item .
Curious if he should change his policy , he put the question to a vote .
Readers responded 60 - 40 against allowing comments .
Even more striking than the fact that these readers were denying themselves a voice was the reason some of them gave for declining the offer :

And others are so brilliantly envisioned and engineered that it ’s hard to imagine what we did before they came along .
The HYmini looks like a large hand - fan , the kind you keep in the car for those midsummer days stuck in traffic .
However , it ’s not a power - guzzling fan – it ’s a miniature turbine .
Hold it up to the wind , and as long as the air is running through the blades faster than 9 m.p.h. , the rechargeable battery is filling up .
( Say goodbye to the frustration of forgetting your various chargers and adapters . )
Next plug it into your phone , iPod , camera , laptop or other portable device of your choice , and charge that up .
All without going near your wall socket .
Or , if the air is slack and you ’re getting a lot of sunshine , plug the miniSOLAR in .
And if you ’re not getting either , plug in the hand - crank .
Strap it to your arm when you go running or cycling – and yes , HYmini have thought of this already .
The basic HYmini package ( without miniSOLAR or hand - crank ) is available now at the modest price of $ 50 and comes in charcoal , white and neon granny smith .

Q . The general said we have raised the number of trained Iraqi security forces fighting alongside American troops .
Is it a significant rise ?
A. Sixty percent .
From five to eight .
Q. Five to eight brigades ?
Divisions ?
A. No. Troops .
Used to be five guys we could trust .
Now it ’s eight .
Q. What happened to the Democrats holding the general ’s feet to the fire ?
A. Everyone except Moveon.org scampered away like 12 - year - old girls running from a big hairy spider .
Q. What did Moveon.org do ?
A . They ran a full - page ad in The New York Times spotlighting “ General Betray Us . ”
Q. Why ?
A . How often do you get a rhyme like that ?
Once in a lifetime shot ; they took it .
Q. Does n’t the latest national intelligence estimate report Iraq ’s government is paralyzed by internal squabbling and petty personal differences ?
A . Yes , so if you think about it , we have made strides in installing an American - style democracy .

The world 's largest porn studio says that Google and Yahoo ! should " erect stronger barriers " to keep porn away from the world 's children .
Steven Hirsch , the co-chairman and co-founder of Vivid Entertainment , is to deliver this message on Saturday in New Haven , Connecticut as he addresses an army of Yale University MBA candidates .
" Responsible companies in the adult industry such as ours have done a great deal to deter minors from accessing adult material , " Hirsch proclaims from inside a Vivid press release .
" None of the search engines and portals , but particularly Yahoo and Google , has taken any significant steps in this direction .
" Vivid will work with any company that is ready to make it much more difficult for children to be exposed , even inadvertently , to material intended only for adults .
This is not about First Amendment rights , it is about protecting children . "
They are endangered , the porn king says , because the likes Google and Yahoo !
do a poor job of promoting their porn filters and age - verification tools .
And while we are on the subject ...
Hirsch also says that he does his best to convince his porn stars they should n't be porn stars .
" I do interview all of the Vivid Girls personally before we sign them to exclusive contracts , " he continues .
" But , guess what ?
I spend more time trying to talk a new girl OUT of becoming a porn star as I do discussing the deal points of her contract once she 's convinced me that she really does want to go down that path . "
And he wants everyone to understand that he 's a serious businessman .
" In the end , running the world 's biggest adult film studio is n't that much different than running any other studio except that our product is pretty much exclusively about sex , " he rambles on .
" The truth is , Vivid Entertainment is a business like any other .
And my job is concerned as much with cost of goods , margins and EBITDA as it is with trying to come up with the idea for the next ' Debbie Does Dallas ... Again . ' "
Oh , and he knows his tech too .
" We always believed it was important to stay on top of all new technologies , " he insists , before listing all sorts of things that only occasionally involve new technologies .
" But we were also the first adult studio to sign talent to exclusive contracts ; the first to change adult video packaging to make it more appealing to consumers and retailers ; the first to really capitalize on the Internet for branding ; the first to own a cable TV network ; the first to shoot movies in Hi Def and to go after the wireless market in an effective way ; the first to diversify with special interest labels such as Vivid - Alt , Vivid - Ed , Vivid - Celeb and even Vivid - Plus for those who like to watch women of notable stature ; and the first to license our name with a professionally managed program that has included book publishing , comics , condoms , vodka , shoes , apparel and other merchandise .
In publishing , ' How to Have a XXX Sex Life ' by the Vivid Girls , published by HarperCollins , became a best seller and recently went into paperback . " ®
When young American men and women sign up to serve in US military , our government makes a basic promise to them : that if they are wounded in the line of duty they will get the care they need .
Unfortunately , for tens of thousands of veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan , that ’s a promise that only exists on paper .
On Feb. 18 , 2007 , the headline " Soldiers Face Neglect , Frustration at Army ’s Top Medical Facility " splashed across the front page of one of the nation ’s premier newspapers , the Washington Post .
The article , which described unsafe conditions and substandard care at Walter Reed Army Medical Center , began with the story of Army Specialist Jeremy Duncan , who was airlifted out of Iraq in February 2006 with a broken neck and a shredded left ear , " nearly dead from blood loss . "
" Behind the door of Army Spec. Jeremy Duncan ’s room , part of the wall is torn and hangs in the air , weighted down with black mold , " the article read .
" When the wounded combat engineer stands in his shower and looks up , he can see the bathtub on the floor above through a rotted hole .
The entire building , constructed between the world wars , often smells like greasy carry - out .
Signs of neglect are everywhere : mouse droppings , belly - up cockroaches , stained carpets , cheap mattresses . "
The Washington Post ‘s coverage of the Scandal at Walter Reed sparked outrage and finger - pointing across official Washington , but the controversy did not solve the problem of substandard care .
Eight months later , in September , Sergeant GJ Cassidy died while receiving treatment for blast injuries at Fort Knox .
A GAO report released at the time of his death showed half of the military ’s Warrior Transition Units had " significant shortfalls " of doctors , nurses and other caregivers who to treat wounded soldiers .
It ’s not known how many other soldiers have died the way GJ Cassidy did  alone while allegedly seeking medical care from their government .
But what we do know that increasingly veterans of the Iraq war are taking their own lives , when the Pentagon and the VA fail to provide adequate medical care .
A CBS news investigation in November found that 120 veterans kill themselves every week ; or over 6,000 per year .
CBS asked all 50 states for their suicide data , based on death records for veterans and non-veterans , and found that veterans were twice as likely to commit suicide , Among those taking their own lives was Sergeant Brian Jason Rand , who served two tours in Iraq .
On February 20 , 2007 , the Clarksville , Tennessee police department found his body lying facedown under an entertainment pavilion on the banks of the Cumberland River , with a shotgun beside it .
Then there are those who become homeless because of government inaction .
On any given night 200,000 veterans sleep homeless on the street .
Increasingly those veterans are younger folks who served in Iraq and Afghanistan .
People like Specialist James Eggemeyer , who ended up homeless just a few months after returning home from Iraq with a severe case of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder brought on by loading the bodies of dead Iraqis into a Blackhawk helicopter .
The VA took so long to process Eggemeyer ’s disability claim that he had to live out of his truck while he waited .
The average wait time for a veteran ’s disability claim to be decided is now 183 days .
More than 600,000 disabled vets are waiting .
Tens of thousands more veterans are being totally denied medical care and disability benefits they were promised after serving abroad .
The numbers are staggering : 11,407 U.S. soldiers have been discharged for drug abuse after serving in Iraq or Afghanistan ; 6,159 have been kicked out for " discreditable incidents " ; 6,436 have been discharged for " commission of a serious offense " ; 2,246 have been discharged for " the good of the service " ; and 3,365 have been discharged for " personality disorder , " according to Pentagon data I obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request .
Among those dishonorably discharged after honorably serving in Iraq is Specialist Shaun Manuel who returned from a tour in Iraq to find his newborn son dead of a rare genetic disease called Muscular Spinal Atrophy .
Manuel said the situation was made even more painful when his superiors ordered him to begin training for a second tour in Iraq .
" My son passed away , " he told me .
" You gonna ’ send an emotionally distressed soldier to Iraq  who knows what he ’s going to do ?
I ’m ready to just blow the whole world up because I did n’t see my son being born and then he just passed away on me with no warning . "
Manuel never filed paperwork to medically excuse him from the deployment .
Instead , he withdrew and buried himself in alcohol .
He estimates he drank three fifths of liquor a day .
At one point , his wife had to call the police during a domestic disturbance .
So the military expelled him with dishonorable discharge and now bars him from getting health care and disability benefits .
Even those who have n’t seen combat can be in for a fight .
Private Durrell Michael threw out his back loading generators on a US military base in South Korea .
He could barely walk or stand upright , but the Army tried to deploy him to Iraq anyway .
When he fought back , they gave him a dishonorable discharge .
Now , he ’s in another fight : with the VA for medical care .
The Pursuit of Happiness in Perspective
“ You ca n’t move in Britain for people trying to make you happy , ” complained a British journalist recently in the pages of the Guardian .
[ 1 ]
He was drawing attention to his country ’s current , and apparently all - consuming , interest in happiness .
Works of self - help psychology line the shelves of the country ’s bookstores , “ happiness studies ” thrives as an academic discipline , and politicians and policymakers — both Labour and Tory — are pushing to make happiness a central issue of statecraft .
As the noted British economist Lord Richard Layard declared not long ago , “ Happiness should become the goal of policy , and the progress of national happiness should be measured and analyzed as closely as the growth of GNP . ” [ 2 ]
Such aspirations are hardly confined to Great Britain .
In the United States , Europe , and throughout much of the developed world , happiness has emerged in recent years as a subject of intense scrutiny — prodded by psychologists , economists , sociologists , and policy makers in what has been styled a “ new science . ”
The subject of countless cover stories , books , and news documentaries , happiness may be thought of , rightly , as the “ the sole horizon of our democracies . ” [ 3 ]
Seemingly , we can see nothing else .
The question is what this myopia means :
Is our focus on happiness in contemporary culture taking us closer to our coveted end ?
Or does our self - conscious striving and frenetic pursuit signal something else ?
The Recent History of Happiness
In order to get a handle on this question — to have some sense of where we are now , and where we might be going — it helps to appreciate where we have been .
To do that involves coming to terms with the past , and particularly with a dramatic revolution in human expectations carried out in western culture since the second half of the seventeenth century .
[ 4 ]
The case of England is important in this regard .
For although the recent British obsession with happiness may seem surprising to some , and even ironic , given that commentators have long associated the English character with a gloomy penchant for melancholy — the “ English malady ” as George Cheyne described it in a 1733 book of that name — in truth the “ pursuit of happiness ” in England has a long history .
[ 5 ]
Both the precise phrase and the reality it sought to describe have been recurrent features of English culture and politics since the mid-seventeenth century , when men and women first dared to dream that happiness might be something more than a millenarian dream .
Whereas prior to that time people had tended to think of happiness as either the preserve of a virtuous minority or as an otherworldly reward for God ’s elect , seventeenth - century English authors like John Locke presented happiness as something to which all human beings could aspire in this life .
“ The business of man is to be happy in this world , ” Locke affirmed boldly , and in the succeeding century people throughout Europe and the Americas got busy , working in keeping with the new utilitarian current that swept the western world to maximize pleasure and minimize pain , bringing the greatest happiness to the greatest number . [ 6 ]
For the first time in human history , large numbers of men and women were presented with the novel prospect that they might aspire to happiness in this life not as the consequence of extraordinary achievement or special favor , but simply as a result of being human .
That this was in many respects a liberating prospect — one that remains at the heart of our deepest - held humanitarian assumptions — should not be doubted , above all by Americans , whose forefathers embraced the new teaching on happiness with greater enthusiasm than any other people in the world .
If the eighteenth century , according to contemporaries like the Milanese economist Pietro Verri , was the happiest epoch in the history of humanity , then America , its proponents argued , was the world ’s happiest place .
The freedom of its institutions and the general equality of its conditions had created “ the greatest sum of happiness that perhaps any nation ever enjoyed , ” exalted the noted architect Benjamin Latrobe not long after the adoption of the federal constitution .
[ 7 ]
In theory there was no limit to its growth .
As Thomas Paine affirmed in 1776 , borrowing the image of the tabula rasa from Locke , America “ hath a blank sheet to write upon . ”
It could be “ as happy as it pleases . ” [ 8 ]
Freeing individuals from the fatalistic acceptance of the world as a vale of tears , this new attitude , enshrined in the Declaration of Independence , turned ever greater numbers of men and women loose to pursue happiness wherever they might find it .
To be sure , the right of pursuit — like the hope of attainment — was only gradually extended to all , with certain groups ( most obviously African Americans ) forced to struggle inordinately to secure a right that for too long was unjustly denied .
And yet in both Europe and America the logic of the pursuit of happiness , like that of other universal rights , was inexorably in the direction of extension and expansion .
Already in the 1840s , the British critic Thomas Carlyle was moved to observe ( not without dismay ) that “ Every pitifulest whipster that walks within a skin has had his head filled with the notion that he is , shall be , or by all human and divine laws ought to be , ‘ happy . ’ ” [ 9 ]
Since that time , that expectation has only grown .
Who among us today would deny that all should have the right to pursue happiness , even to find it ?
Thus , one of the most striking developments in Western societies over the last several hundred years is the steady expansion of the hope and expectation of happiness in this life .
Concomitant with this expansion has been the steady erosion of other ways of conceiving of life ’s purpose and end .
If other ways of doing so have not been entirely abandoned — there are those who still live for virtue , honor , one ’s homeland , or family name — in a world that places a premium on good feeling and positive emotion , these other ends have nowhere near the power to channel and constrain our choices that they once did .
The same may be said of religion — long considered the ultimate end — but which today , even in places like the United States , where religious observance remains strong , is more often than not treated as a means to a better and happier life .
The American author of the 1767 True Pleasure , Cheerfulness , and Happiness , The Immediate Consequence of Religion was undoubtedly ahead of his time . [ 10 ]
And yet only decades later , that famous observer of the young republic , Alexis de Tocqueville , found it difficult to be sure when listening to American preachers “ whether the main object of religion is to procure eternal felicity in the next world or prosperity in this . ” [ 11 ]
Today , when not only Protestants , but Catholics , Jews , Buddhists , and Muslims regularly offer their faiths in America as effective means to earthly happiness , it is more difficult still to discern religion ’s main object .
In a sense , they too serve the greatest of the modern gods , the most ultimate of ultimate ends : the god of good feeling , who now reigns here below .
So that is how we have come to our present place and horizon , seeing the world in perfect keeping with the injunction of a seventeenth - century Englishman , who once urged that “ We must look through all things upon happiness , and through happiness upon all . ” [ 12 ]
The question , however , remains :
What should we make of this spectacle ?
Putting the Pursuit in Its Place
In the first place , we would probably do well to remind ourselves that worrying about happiness is a luxury — the privilege of peoples whose more pressing needs have been satisfied already .
With longer lifespans and more abundant food supplies , greater security and more creature comforts than ever before , we are free to contemplate what those exposed to the miseries of famine , chaos , and disease can only dream .
On one level , then , we worry about happiness today with such single - minded focus because we can : Inhabitants of the world ’s developed nations are the most fortunate creatures to have walked the face of the earth .
And yet for all our focus on happiness it is by no means clear that we are happier as a result .
Might we not even say that our contemporary concern is something of an inauspicious sign , belying a deep anxiety and doubt about the object of our pursuit ?
Does the fact that we worry so much about being happy suggest that we are not ?
For some influential commentators , the answer to that question is not so much whether we are happy , but whether we are happy enough , and to that they answer resolutely “ no . ” Richard Layard , for example , one of the most influential proponents of using the new science of happiness to guide public policy , concedes that “ In the West we have a society that is probably as happy as any there has ever been . ” [ 13 ]
And yet he and others point to survey data collected since the 1950s that asks citizens whether they are “ very happy , ” “ pretty happy , ” or “ not too happy . ”
Essentially , those numbers have not changed , despite massive increases during the same period of Gross National Product ( GNP ) .
Layard and his colleagues regard this data as indicative of what the journalist Gregg Easterbrook calls the “ progress paradox ” : as people get richer , they do n’t appear to get happier , or at least not very much after a certain minimum threshold has been crossed . [ 14 ]
What Layard and his colleagues conclude from this is that governments promoting wealth - creation have their priorities wrong .
Instead of working to promote GNP , they should strive instead to maximize Gross National Happiness ( GNH ) .
Although that goal may at first sound appealing , there are , I believe , strong reasons for skepticism .
In the first place , history is littered with attempts to establish what Layard ’s colleague , the Nobel laureate in economics , Daniel Kahneman , has called “ objective happiness . ” [ 15 ]
From Jeremy Bentham ’s efforts to apply “ arithmetical calculation to the elements of happiness ” to Marx ’s quest to secure “ real happiness , ” the dream of scientifically managing social welfare has enticed theorists and technocrats alike . [ 16 ]
The fact that all have failed , of course , does not ipso facto mean that present and future attempts will similarly come to naught .
But that knowledge should at the very least give us pause .
Moreover , as the economists Bruno Frey and Alois Stutzer have argued , even if one does grant that psychologists and sociologists have made significant advances in measuring human happiness ( as indeed they have ) , it does not follow that governments should be charged with tracking and securing it for the people . [ 17 ]
Not only would an aggregate gross national happiness indicator be especially susceptible to government manipulation and citizen distortion — thereby calling into question its practical feasibility — but the very idea of a single social welfare function tends to disregard the democratic process , reducing individual sovereignty to self - reports of one ’s well - being .
Though in many respects enthusiastic about the new happiness research , Frey and Stutzer conclude that individuals and intermediary associations — not governments — are the best agents to put its findings to work .
Finally , to reason from the apparent stagnancy of self - reported happiness data to the conclusion that governments should shift their priorities from wealth - creation to happiness - creation is to ignore the simple fact that increased wealth may — and most certainly does — bring all sorts of other benefits regardless of its effect on subjective well - being .
The fact that our diets and healthcare are such that we live , on average , decades longer than men and women at the beginning of the twentieth century ; that travel to most places in the world is now widely accessible and affordable ; that the world ’s literature , film , and art are but a mouse - click away ; that the average inhabitant of a developed nation has more wealth and possibilities at his or her disposal than many of history ’s mightiest kings — none of these or countless other benefits of expanded GNP may actually boost our self - reported happiness .
I am perfectly prepared to grant that they do not .
But then , happiness researchers claim , neither does having children . [ 18 ]
Should we stop producing offspring because they do n’t increase our happiness ?
Clearly , to see the world only in terms of happiness is to see through a narrow lens .
Such arguments could be developed at greater length — as indeed I have tried , in part , to do elsewhere . [ 19 ]
But here let me draw attention to another fact : that the “ progress paradox ” is only a paradox if one assumes that human beings should be getting happier all the time .
That assumption , admittedly , was shared by Paine and Bentham and many others in the eighteenth century .
It follows naturally enough from the revolution in human expectations discussed above .
But whether it is a sound assumption is by no means clear .
Evolutionary psychologists , for example , extrapolating from the theories of Darwin , point out that human beings have a tendency to adapt quickly to pleasures at hand .
To be too happy for too long , apparently , is not an effective adaptive trait .
Better to be a little bit anxious — a little bit unhappy — much of the time , so that we are motivated to continue our pursuits .
The point being that it is by no means clear that humans as a species have a natural capacity for ever - rising levels of happiness .
Might there not be a limit to how happy human beings can reasonably become ?
To speak in this way of natural limits is to argue , in effect , against pursuing happiness too hard .
That may sound like strange advice to American ears , and yet it is counsel that close observers of American society have felt moved to offer before .
Even Thomas Jefferson understood that “ perfect happiness … was never intended by the Deity to be the lot of one of his creatures . ”
John Adams , for his part , observed in his youth that if we sit down late in life to “ make an estimate in our minds of the happiness we have enjoyed , and the misery we have suffered ” we shall find that “ the overbalance of happiness is quite inconsiderable . ”
We shall learn , he cautions , that “ we have been , through the greatest part of our lives , pursuing shadows . ” [ 20 ]
Tocqueville stumbled upon a similar thought in Democracy in America , noting of the inhabitants of the United States that “ No one could work harder to be happy . ”
The American , he observed , will continually change paths “ for fear of missing the shortest cut leading to happiness . ”
Finally , though , “ Death steps in … and stops him before he has grown tired of this futile pursuit of that complete felicity which always escapes him . ”
And that , Tocqueville concluded , in reference to America ’s related quest for an ever - elusive equality , was “ the reason for the strange melancholy often haunting inhabitants of democracies in the midst of abundance , and of that disgust with life sometimes gripping them in calm and easy circumstances . ” [ 21 ]
Perceptive observers of American society , then , have cautioned from the outset about the dangers of pursuing too much .
Perceptive observers of happiness have also arrived at similar conclusions .
As Tocqueville ’s contemporary and friend , John Stuart Mill , realized , “ Ask yourself whether you are happy , and you cease to be so .
The only chance is to treat , not happiness , but some end external to it , as the purpose of life . ” [ 22 ]
Mill , a man who devoted much of his energy to the pursuit of happiness in democratic societies , was speaking in this case of individual lives .
But his insight applies equally well to societies as a whole .
It is noteworthy that Mill ’s tough - minded successor as a defender of liberty and democracy , George Orwell , essentially agreed .
“ Men can only be happy when they do not assume that the object of life is happiness , ” he cautioned in 1944 . [ 23 ]
Orwell ’s words are worth heeding today , as are those of that other great English dystopian writer of the twentieth century , Aldous Huxley .
Indeed , whereas 1984 can now seem a somewhat dated , if no less masterful , reflection on the concerns of the Cold War , Huxley ’s Brave New World remains very much on the horizon of our future .
Its denizens live with unflinching “ faith in happiness as the Sovereign Good , ” consuming in abundance , indulging their desires without guilt or inhibition , distracting themselves with the virtual reality of films with simple plots and the cult of youth .
Forgetting the past and all things unpleasant in an effort to minimize pain , they maximize pleasure with mood - enhancing drugs and genetic manipulation .
Everybody in the Brave New World is “ happy nowadays , ” and yet the world is a nightmare . [ 24 ]
We are , I trust , still very far from that .
But what a shame it would be to dream only of happiness and then wake up in a world in which we are miserable .

An artist 's conception of an Earth - like planet around another star .
Earth may have a twin orbiting one of our nearest stellar neighbors , a new study suggests .
University of California , Santa Cruz graduate student Javiera Guedes used computer simulations of planet formation to show that terrestrial planets are likely to have formed around one of the stars in the Alpha Centauri star system , our closest stellar neighbors .
Guedes ' model showed planets forming around the star Alpha Centauri B ( its sister star , Proxima Centauri , is actually our nearest neighbor ) in what is called the " habitable zone , " or the region around a star where liquid water can exist on a planet 's surface .
The model also showed that if such planets do in fact exist , we should be able to see them with a dedicated telescope .
" If they exist , we can observe them , " Guedes said .
Guedes ' study has been accepted for publication in the Astrophysical Journal .
A likely candidate
Astronomers have for some time pinned the Alpha Centauri system as one that was likely to form planets , said study co-author Gregory Laughlin , a UCSC professor .
" I think that there 's been a good line of evidence over the past decade or so , " Laughlin told SPACE.com .
Several factors mark the system , particularly Alpha Centauri B as friendly to planet formation , Laughlin said .
The metallicity of Alpha Centauri B ( or how much of its matter is made up of elements heavier than hydrogen and helium ) is higher than our Sun's , so there would be plenty of heavier - mass material for planets to form from , he said .
Also , because the planet iwould form in a triple star system , the processes that form large Jupiter - mass gas giants , which account for most of the extrasolar planets found so far , would be suppressed .
So it would be more likely for the system to produce terrestrial planets .
Laughlin also noted that a number of factors make Alpha Centauri B a good candidate for astronomers to actually detect an Earth - sized terrestrial planet .
Training telescopes
The Doppler detection method , which has revealed the majority of the 228 known extrasolar planets , measures shifts in the light from a star to detect the tiny wobble induced by the gravitational tug of an orbiting planet .
Because Alpha Centauri
B is so bright and nearby , detecting a small terrestrial planet 's miniscule wobble would be that much easier .
Also , its position high in the sky of the Southern Hemisphere means it is observable for most of the year , just as the Big Dipper is observable for most of the year in the Northern Hemisphere .
According to Laughlin , five years of observations using a dedicated telescope would be needed to detect an Earth - like planet around Alpha Centauri B .
If astronomers do dedicate substantial resources to detecting an Earth - like planet , this is the star to focus on , he added .
" We 're advocating that there 's a strong possibility a planet could be there , " he said .
Other stars are thought to harbor Earth - like planets , and solar systems like ours are starting to be found .
Astromoners announced last month the discovery of a solar system with striking similarities to ours .
If such a planet is found , spacecraft , such as the proposed Terrestrial Planet Finder , could be launched to find out more information about the world , such as whether or not it had water on its surface , Laughlin said .
Study co-author Debra Fischer of San Francisco State University is leading an observational program to intensively monitor Alpha Centauri A and B using the 1.5 - meter telescope at the Cerro Tololo Inter - American Observatory in Chile .
The researchers hope to detect real planets similar to the ones that emerged in the computer simulations .
" I think the planets are there , and it 's worth a try to have a look , " Laughlin said .
The Open Source Initiative ( OSI ) , the organization responsible for maintaining the definition of open source and evaluating open source licenses , has officially approved the Microsoft Community ( Ms- CL ) and Permissive ( Ms - PL ) licenses .
Microsoft submitted its Shared Source licenses shortly after announcing plans to do so at the O'Reilly Open Source Convention earlier this year .
OSI president Michael Tiemann responded by pointing out that three of Microsoft 's five Shared Source licenses impose restrictions that are clearly inconsistent with the Open Source definition , but acknowledged that the two licenses submitted by Microsoft had merit and would be evaluated .
" The decision to approve was informed by the overwhelming ( though not unanimous ) consensus from the open - source community that these licenses satisfied the 10 criteria of the Open Source definition , and should therefore be approved , " said OSI in a statement .
" Microsoft came to the OSI and submitted their licenses according to the published policies and procedures that dozens of other parties have followed over the years .
Microsoft did n't ask for special treatment , and did n't receive any .
In spite of recent negative interactions between Microsoft and the open - source community , the spirit of the dialog was constructive and we hope that carries forward to a constructive outcome as well . "
OSI 's decision to approve the Ms - PL and Ms- CL ( also known as the Microsoft Reciprocal License ) is unsurprising , since the Free Software Foundation 's European branch has already voiced support for the licenses , publicly congratulated Microsoft for creating them , and expressed appreciation for the similarities between the Ms- CL and the FSF 's own GPL license .
Despite receiving the praise of FSF Europe , Microsoft 's open - source licenses have been widely criticized .
Critics are concerned that Microsoft is trying to muddy the waters by obfuscating the distinction between its open - source licenses and its more restrictive shared - source licenses .
The incompatibility between Microsoft 's open source licenses and other prominent open source licenses is also a point of contention , since critics argue that it contributes to needless license proliferation , which contributes to fragmentation of the open - source ecosystem .
This last criticism is also applicable to open - source licenses created by many other companies , like Sun 's CDDL for instance .
Despite the problematic nature of license proliferation , the open source community would benefit considerably if Microsoft were to release more source code under these licenses .
Microsoft has already released the Dynamic Language Runtime ( DLR ) for .NET under the Ms - PL , which means that it can be included in the open - source Mono .NET runtime and used in Novell 's open source Silverlight implementation .
It should be noted that the source code Microsoft recently released for the .NET Framework Libraries is distributed under the highly restrictive Microsoft Reference License , which is not an open - source license and does n't facilitate redistribution .
Microsoft will hopefully take this opportunity to demonstrate its willingness to promote open source .
NET development by relicensing the .NET Framework Libraries under one of the company 's OSI - approved licenses .
Although OSI validation of Microsoft 's licenses is a very big win for Microsoft and the open - source software community , this victory is overshadowed by Microsoft 's aggressive attitude towards open - source software .
Certain vocal factions of the OSS community will express extreme distrust for Microsoft 's open - source licenses , which will make it difficult for the company to build a bridge with the broader OSS community .
Microsoft 's unsubstantiated patent threats and blatantly dishonest studies do n't help the situation .
The Ghost Whisperer star writes on her blog that she loves her body
It should be the time of her life for Jennifer Love Hewitt , instead the newly engaged actress is taking to the Internet to speak out about unflattering photos of herself snapped by the paparazzi during her Hawaiian getaway with fiancé , Scottish actor Ross McCall .
“ Like all women out there should , I love my body , ” Hewitt , 28 , wrote on her blog after photos of her in a bikini hit the Web .
“ I know what I look like , and so do my friends and family . ”
Get push notifications with news , features and more .
Hewitt , who has modeled for Hanes , explains , “ I ’ve sat by in silence for a long time now about the way women ’s bodies are constantly scrutinized .
To set the record straight , I ’m not upset for me , but for all of the girls out there that are struggling with their body image . ”
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- U.S. Rep. Rick Renzi has been indicted on charges he promised to support legislation in exchange for a land deal that netted the Arizona Republican more than $ 700,000 , the Justice Department said Friday .
In a 35 - count indictment unsealed early Friday , Renzi , 49 , is charged with conspiracy , wire fraud , money laundering , extortion and insurance fraud .
Also named in the indictment is Renzi 's former business partner and real estate investor , James W. Sandlin , 56 , of Sherman , Texas , and Andrew Beardall , 36 , of Rockville , Maryland .
Renzi's attorneys , Reid Weingarten and Kelly Kramer , denied their client had done anything wrong .
" We will fight these charges until he is vindicated and his family 's name is restored , " the attorneys said in a statement .
The attorneys said their client had buried his father , Eugene Renzi , at Arlington National Cemetery on Thursday .
" We are disappointed that the Department of Justice would not allow a decent amount of time to pass to allow a son to mourn the passing of his father , " the statement said .
At a news conference in Phoenix , Arizona , prosecutors said Renzi conspired with Sandlin to conduct a land swap in exchange for the congressman 's push to get a House committee 's approval for the deal .
Federal prosecutors said Renzi received $ 733,000 in the deal but did not disclose the income to Congress in his 2005 financial disclosure statement .
U.S. Attorney Diane Humetewa said that Renzi " used his official authority as a United States representative " to ensure that the 2005 federal land exchange included land owned by Sandlin .
Another goal of the conspiracy was to conceal that Renzi received a portion of the proceeds from the deal , according to the indictment .
Renzi was having financial difficulty in 2005 and " needed a substantial infusion of funds to keep his insurance business solvent and maintain his personal lifestyle , " the indictment said .
The 26 - page indictment outlines a series of transactions involving Renzi and Sandlin , who were co-owners of Fountain Realty and Development , until Renzi ran for a seat in Congress and sold his share of the company to Sandlin .
Sandlin bought out Renzi's interest for $ 200,000 and a note for $ 800,000 , according to a statement from the Justice Department .
In 2005 , when Sandlin still owed him $ 700,000 on the note , " Renzi insisted that two separate entities doing business in Arizona purchase Sandlin 's property in exchange for his support on land exchange legislation , " authorities said .
Renzi and Beardall are charged with insurance fraud , accused of embezzling more than $ 400,000 in insurance premiums from the trust account of the Patriot Insurance Agency , a business owned by the Renzi family in Santa Cruz County , Arizona , to fund his congressional campaign in 2001 and 2002 .
They 're also accused of making false statements to influence state regulatory investigations , a statement said .
" There were concealment efforts , misrepresentations and fraudulent statements made , " Humetewa said .
If convicted , Renzi could face up to 20 years in prison for wire fraud and extortion and 20 years in prison for conspiracy to commit money laundering and concealing money laundering as well as lesser sentences for convictions on the other counts , prosecutors said .
Renzi and the other defendants will be served summonses to appear in U.S. Magistrate Court in Tucson , Arizona , for an arraignment March 6 , Humetewa said .
Renzi has been under an ethical cloud since the FBI raided a family business last year .
The FBI said it was investigating whether the congressman had used his office for personal gain .
He stepped down from the House Intelligence Committee in April after the raid .
Renzi , a three - term member of the House , announced in August that he would not seek re-election .
He represents Arizona 's 1st Congressional District .

Access to ' potable ' water would transform the lives of many people in the developing world .
Nanotechnology is already being used to remove contaminants from drinking water and increase the availability of fresh water , but there is still a long way to go .
Poverty and water are closely linked , and access to water resources has become widely equated with ensuring that basic human needs are met .
It is predominantly the poor of the world who depend directly on water and other natural resources for their livelihoods .
Water resources must therefore be managed in a sustainable manner in order to maintain the economic , social and environmental functions it provides in contributing to the livelihoods of people .
The complex set of issues involved in the lack of access to potable water and sanitation in various parts of the world have been extensively documented .
In 2002 , 1.1 billion people did not have access to a reliable water supply and 2.6 billion people — the majority of them living in Africa and Asia — lacked access to adequate sanitation1 .
The consequences of this situation are overwhelming : cholera and other diarrhoeal diseases are major killers , especially for children , in the developing world .
Moreover , children often miss school because their schools do not have adequate drinking water and / or sanitation facilities .
Nanotechnology could increase the availability of clean water in the developing world , but different approaches to technology transfer will be needed for different countries .

Many organizations are considering the potential of nanoscience to solve technical challenges associated with the removal of water contaminants and provide ' potable ' water to people in developed and developing countries .
A range of water - treatment devices — including some that incorporate nanotechnology — are already on the market and others are in advanced stages of development .
Conventional water - treatment technologies include filtration , ultraviolet radiation , chemical treatment and desalination , whereas the nano - enabled technologies include a variety of different types of membranes and filters based on carbon nanotubes , nanoporous ceramics , magnetic nanoparticles and other nanomaterials .
Ref. 2 contains a comparison between conventional and nano - enabled technologies for water treatment .
Separation membranes with structure at the nanoscale can also be used in low - cost methods to produce potable water .
In a recent study in South Africa , several polymeric nanofiltration and reverse osmosis membranes were tested for the treatment of brackish groundwater ( water that is salty , but less so than sea water ) .
The tests showed that nanofiltration membranes can produce potable water from the brackish groundwater .
As expected , the reverse osmosis membranes removed about 99 % of all the solutes , but the concentrations of essential nutrients , such as calcium and magnesium ions , were reduced to levels that were below the specifications of the World Health Organization standard for drinking water .
The product water therefore had to be spiked with these nutrients to provide drinking water of the required quality .
These studies also underline the importance of making communities aware of the actual quality of their drinking water because it is not possible to detect contaminants , for example , by simply observing the physical properties of the water ( that is , smell , taste and colour ) .
However , it is not enough to develop technical solutions to these problems — the technology must also be transferred to the country that needs it .
In general , direct technology transfer will encounter obstacles and end in failure .
To be effective , technology transfer must be accompanied by technology adaptation and technology adoption to take account of the technical capability , infrastructure and market potential of the developing country that needs the technology .
Different approaches may well be needed for different developing countries with different sets of socioeconomic realities .
Moreover , if technology transfer is not complemented by an effort to develop local capacity , the entire process could prove to be futile .
Finally , all stake holders should be involved from the planning stages of a community water - treatment project right through to implementation to enhance transparency and dispel distrust between the parties .
Although much attention has been focused on the potential benefits of water - treatment devices that incorporate nanotechnology , there is also a need for more research to assess the potential human health and environmental risks of nanotechnologies .
Although only a few studies have been carried out , some of them indicate that the unique properties of nanomaterials ( for example , size , shape , reactivity , conductivity ) may cause them to be toxic .
There have also been calls for a coordinated risk research agenda to ensure that the right questions are being asked and resources are used efficiently3 .
It is imperative that information about potential risks and risk - management approaches is shared widely , although the risks involved also need to be weighed up against the potential benefits .
Nano - enabled technologies for water treatment are already on the market — with nanofiltration currently seeming to be the most mature — and many more are on their way .
Although the current generation of nanofilters may be relatively simple , many researchers believe that future generations of water - treatment devices will capitalize on the new properties of nanoscale materials and may prove to be of interest in both developing and developed countries .
Developing countries are at different levels of scientific advancement and have different priorities , so they cannot be subjected to a general prescription for solving water - related and other developmental problems .
However , access to potable water is a global problem that requires a concerted effort from all those involved .
It needs resources , technology ( nano or otherwise ) and effective adaptation and adoption strategies that are strongly based on knowledge sharing and local capacity development .

OMAHA , Nebraska ( Reuters ) - Democratic U.S. presidential hopeful Barack Obama agreed on Thursday to hold two more debates with rival Hillary Clinton before March 4 , officials from his campaign said .
One debate will take place on February 26 in Cleveland , Ohio .
The other will take place in Texas on a date to be determined .
Ohio , Rhode Island , Texas and Vermont hold nominating contests on March 4 .
Clinton had pushed to hold five debates in that period , but Obama rejected that , saying he needed to spend more time at campaign events with voters .
Candidates usually take time out of their campaign schedules to prepare on the days that debates are held .
If recent history is any guide , this fall ’s presidential election will be marred by vote suppression and cynical dirty tricks .
Congress still has time to stop some of the worst offenses .
The Senate is considering two bills , one to outlaw so - called vote caging and another to rein in duplicitous robo-calls .
Congress should pass both bills well before Election Day .
Vote caging is a little - known but pernicious technique .
Political operatives mail letters to voters , targeting areas where the opposing party is strong .
If a letter is returned as undeliverable , the voter ’s name is put on a list to be challenged at the polls .
The challengers try to persuade election officials not to let the person vote , or only to let them cast a provisional ballot .
Some voters end up disenfranchised .
No matter how the challenges turn out , they often create confusion and long lines , reducing turnout in the targeted precincts .
Minority voters have been especially victimized .
In an infamous case in Louisiana , a Republican political operative boasted that a vote - caging program “ could keep the black vote down considerably . ”
Vote caging is sometimes defended as a way of removing ineligible voters from the rolls .
But there are many reasons letters are returned , including errors in names and addresses , which are common on direct - mail lists .
Senator Sheldon Whitehouse , Democrat of Rhode Island , has sponsored a good bill that would require operatives to present better evidence when they challenge a voter ’s eligibility , such as verifiable proof that a prospective voter has moved or died .
The bill would not deter legitimate efforts to keep ineligible people from voting , but it should greatly reduce the use of voter challenges as an Election Day dirty trick .
" Until IE is reasonably standards - compliant you can expect no quarter from us .
We 've spent too much time designing web sites that will work for CSS and then work for IE .
We 've destroyed budgets , pissed off our bosses , irritated clients and made development more expensive because of your little ( Rosemary 's ) baby .
We web developers [ are ] fully aware that when your sweaty , monkey - boy of a boss was leaping around onstage chanting ' developers !
developers !
developers !' , he most certainly was n't thinking about us . "

Firefox 2.0.0.8 , Opera 9.50 , Safari 3.0.3 , Konqueror 3.5.5 , Seamonkey 1.x , Seamonkey 2.0a1 pre , K-meleon 1.x , Galeon 2 , Epiphany 2 , NS 6.1 , NS 6.2 , NS 7.0 , NS 7.2 , Hv3 TKHTML alpha 16 , Amaya 9.55 all pass this test .
This bug has been reported at connect 's IE beta feedback as bug 339085 .
This IE 5 + bug has been reported many times , in many newsgroup discussion forums on web authoring , in various webpages , blogs from web developers .
It 's really worth mentioning a few of them and quoting some highly relevant testimonials describing accurately the effects of this bug :
" IE gets its text resizing horribly wrong when just using ems . (... ) bump the text size up or down , and you 'll notice that IE scales ems far more drastically than percentages , resulting in too big / too small text . "
from Patrick H. Lauke , May 18th 2004 , Weblog comments :
How to size text using ems
" text sized in ems can be resized across all browsers .
However IE 6 and IE 7 unacceptably exaggerate the smallness and largeness of the resized text "
from Richard Rutter , November 20th 2007 , How to Size Text in CSS
" However , ( gasp ) IE has a problem with ems .
Resizing text from medium ( default ) to large in IE 5/6 would lead to a huge increase in font size rather than the gradual one expected "
from Jon Tan , September 27th 2007 , The Incredible Em & Elastic Layouts with CSS
" If for instance you set the root element ( either < body > or < html > ) to font - size : 1em , then just setting View >
Text Size to ' smaller ' can cause the text to become unreadably small . "
from css-discuss.incutio.com , 2007 , UsingEms , A word of caution concerning Internet Explorer
" When I tried font - size : 1em , my IE 6 browser ' text size ' will toggle from very tiny to very huge .
.... Not acceptable for accessibility ! "
from Krystof , August 29th 2005 , Weblog comments :
How to size text using ems
" Simply put , IE for Windows ' relative font size inheritance cascade is broken . (...)
If you find it necessary to size through cascade , you 'll find % works more reliably than ems . "
from InternetExplorerWinBugs , IE Font Sizing Bugs : Inheritance at css-discuss.incutio.com

" (...) the next incarnation of the [ Internet Explorer ] bug database ?
What makes you think that there is ever going to be a next incarnation ? (...)
It has been ' temporarily ' offline for more than a year .
It is n't coming back .
(...)
I have a solution , openness .
The IE team can start * actually * communicating with people , especially developers , about the content of IE8 , the roadmap of IE 's future , both with IE8 but also beyond that , and how they are going to address the issues that web developers still have with them .
They can recreate ( or create ) a bug database in which developers can log IE issues and they can actually do * something * with the issues logged so that people can see progress .
(...)
How about sitting down with the makers of the other browsers ( like Opera , Apple , Mozilla , not to mention others ) to discuss how they can work together for the common good of the web ?
(...)
There needs to be a way for developers to log real issues , which the IE team then triages and potentially responds to , * at all times * , not just during a beta .
If they have a temporary bug database and then turn it off , I will understand why they do so but that does n't really solve the problem of ' How do you report a serious bug or issue to the IE team ? ' and ' If you do report an issue , how do you know if it will ever be addressed ? '
These are real issues to people . "

81 - Internet Explorer 6 , Internet Explorer 7 and Internet Explorer 8 do not support favicon of type image / png ( or of other types of image like gif ) : favicon of type image / png demo .
A favicon ( or web site icon ) image in png ( PNG is an official W3C web standard ) or in gif image format are not supported by Internet Explorer for specifying favicon ; only the .ico file format for specifying a favicon is supported by Internet Explorer .
This is clearly insufficient .
Jeff Davis , IE project manager in his why does n't the favicon for my site appear in IE7 ?
states
" It must actually be a .ico ( an Icon ) file .
Bitmaps , pngs , gifs , etc , will not work . " .
How to Add a Shortcut Icon to a Web Page at MSDN states " To create the icon , use an icon editor , such as the one included in Microsoft Visual Studio , and save the icon in the .ico file format .
Internet Explorer will ignore icons that are not in .ico format , and will instead display the default Internet Explorer shortcut icon . " .

New Internet Explorer 7 tax On June 13th 2012 , Australian retailer Kogan.com has started to charge an extra 6.8 % " tax " on any goods purchased by customers using Internet Explorer 7 .
" The way we 've been able to keep our prices so low is by using technology to make our business efficient and streamlined .
One of the things stopping that is our web team having to spend a lot of time making our new website look normal on IE7 .
This is an extremely old browser , so from today , anyone buying from the site who uses IE7 will be lumped with a 6.8 % surcharge - that 's 0.1 % for each month IE7 has been on the market :
It 's not only costing us a huge amount , it 's affecting any business with an online presence , and costing the Internet economy millions . "

I author to standards , it takes a few minutes to tweak things to get everything perfect in browsers like Firefox and Safari , and then ages to work around all of Internet Explorer 's bugs and shortcomings .
The time to implement a decent XHTML Strict + CSS 2 design would be shortened by at least a third if Internet Explorer was n't so buggy .
I have measured this personally across a number of projects .
(...) CSS 2 is over six years old , and Microsoft have had employees in the CSS working group the whole time . (...)
Given that Microsoft are the world 's biggest software company , it looks very much like standards are deliberately being sabotaged .
Is it any wonder web developers are starting to get royally pissed off with Microsoft ? "

IE7b2 , is it intentionally this bad ? , Erik Arvidsson , February 1st , 2006
It sounds like something out of Jules Verne or The Jetsons , but in 1870 a " pneumatic subway " ran under Broadway in Manhattan .
Built in secret so as to not to arouse the ire of Tammany Hall , only a block - long segment between Warren and Murray Streets was completed before an enterprising reporter for the New York Tribune exposed its existence .

" Let the reader imagine a cylindrical tube eight feet in the clear , bricked up and whitewashed , neat , clean , dry , and quiet , " explained Scientific American in early 1870 .
The car itself fit snugly within the tube ( there was an inch and a half clearance ) and carried eighteen passengers at a cost of 25 cents each .
" The weirdest thing about the subway project . . . , " opined the New York Times in 1911 , " is that the car was to be blown to and fro . . . by means of a big blowing machine . "
( In 1911 , you could write things like that with a straight face . )
The vacuum created when the air current was reversed pulled the car back in the opposite direction .
Over 400,000 New Yorkers took a joy ride underground during the three years the pneumatic subway was open for demonstration .
But public enthusiasm could n't protect inventor Alfred Beach and his Beach Pneumatic Railway from the wrath of Tammany Hall .
Even though a bill proposing extension of the subway for the entire length of Broadway as originally planned was supported by state lawmakers , Governor Hoffman caved in to Tammany interests and vetoed the project .
( In his exhaustive and fascinating history of the Beach Pneumatic Railway , Joseph Brennan suggests that Beach himself may have started the now - accepted - as - true story that Tammany Hall forced the closure of his railway . )
When Beach finally gained approval in 1873 ( after Tammany Boss Tweed 's death and a new governor 's inauguration ) , a stock market crashed killed financial support and thus the pneumatic subway .

In 1912 , workers on the new BMT subway line reached Broadway and Warren Street , where they found the pneumatic railway tube , intact and well preserved .
According to NYCSubway.org , the tunnel was almost certainly destroyed to make way for progress .
Will domestic real estate rise because the falling dollar creates a sort of hyper inflation ?
Will the broad stock market rise ( because being long stocks is being short dollars ) or will the domestic equity market fall along with the dollar ?
Will local rents rise or fall ?
Gas prices ?
And what about jobs ?
Will unemployment skyrocket or will it fall as domestic mfgs hire ?
For a typical urban American , how will life change ( especially in the little ways one might not think of when reading a classic econ textbook ) ?
I understand that if the dollar collapses prices Americans pay for foreign goods rise , but I am wondering what other little and big consequences of a falling dollar are ?
What will life be like in a collapsing dollar environment ?

If there 's one thing I know in life , it 's that dogs on boats are the greatest thing on God 's green Earth .
You can have one without the other , but once you put them both together you 're going to find out what you 've been missing all this time .
First , let 's talk about boats .
The helpful heading below will let you know when you 're in the boat zone of the article .
The dog zone follows shortly after that .
Boat
Boat ownership is not so much a stupid hobby but a symbol that you 've done something in life .
When someone sees a boat owner they say , " Look at that guy .
Is that John Ratzenburg ? "
" You mean Ratzenberger ? "
" Yeah , that guy .
Look . "
" No , I do n't think that 's him . "
" Damn , I could swear it was him .
HEY CLIFF ! "
" What the hell are you doing ? "
" Eh , it 's not like he does n't get it all the time .
Calm down , Martha . "
" I ca n't go anywhere with you . "
A boat .
Not that exciting .
Few people who own boats lack life experience .
You do n't see babies owning boats .
If you see a baby on a boat chances are there 's an adult around , probably the father .
Women generally despise the ocean and everything in it .
This stems from centuries of the sea swallowing up sailors and making widows out of their wives .
This does n't happen so much anymore .
It was a very hungry sea but it 's stuffed from all the sailors .
Yum - yum .
But my point is if that a baby owns a boat that 's one pimp ass baby .
There are two types of guys who buy boats .
Rich men and men going through their mid-life crisis .
The latter is pretty pathetic , or is that former .
I always forget .
People just use those two terms to pretend they 're smart .
They should just say , THE SECOND ONE .
A guy will buy a boat because he hates his family .
That 's a pretty good reason to do anything , but he probably can't afford it and eventually the bank will foreclose on his boat .
If you want to buy a boat you have to be a rich man .
It 's not so much about the boat than it is about the richness .
I mean , if you have a boat then you must be rich right ?
Right .
A man may buy a boat to prove how rich he is to others .
This may sound vain , but it's hard to prove to people how rich you are by shoving your cash in their face .
It 's not considered polite .
Shove your boat in their face instead .
Count your boats in front of them !
Even if you have one boat .
Just go , ONE , ONE BOAT !
Ha ha ha ha .
Private boats are generally for recreational purposes and are of no real use to anyone .
People have them just to chill out and drink beer on .
A friend of mine once bought a boat because he thought it would cut down on his commute to work .
He said that there 's no traffic in the ocean and if someone is in front of you you just sail around them or ram them into some rocks .
But then he realized his job is 160 miles inland and does n't use his boat anymore .
This is the same guy who bought a PS3 in order to sell it on ebay and we all laughed at him when his auction got zero bids and he had to return it to Target .
Boats are pretty boring by themselves .
Once you get over the thrill of floating it gets really lame really fast .
Many new boat owners find themselves standing on the port bow stroking their beards and muttering under their breath , " Hmm , this is alright , but it 's missing something ... "
Dog
It is said that dog is man 's best friend .
They are a little too friendly if you ask me .
Nothing is more annoying than a dog that wo n't calm the hell down .
Every time this dog I know sees me he jumps on me and practically starts tea bagging me .
They are excited all the time because they are retarded and wo n't stop until you tell them to go outside and stay there .
But then you feel bad because there is nothing worse in life than making a dog sad .
So you 're like , " Goddamnitt . " and let him back in .
At least it 's better than cats who suck and are worthless .
What does a cat even do ?
Nothing .
And why does a cat even exist ?
Do n't ask me !
They can't even share with each other .
There are these two cats on my block that fight every night over the same territory .
They are all messed up and ugly from the fighting but they never learn .
A dog .
Good , not great .
I have two cats because my girlfriend is female and throws her tampons all over the house like all women do so there are cats .
And these two cats fight all the time .
The fatter one gets super pissed and the only thing that will calm him down is putting him on the tall dresser where he 'll proceed to hiss at the other one until you pretend to strangle it so he thinks it 's dead .
Dogs are just plain better than cats .
Cats will fart on your face while you sleep for no reason .
Buying a dog is hard work though .
Women have a saying that there are no good men left .
They should change it to there are no good dogs left .
It seems that every dog is so inbred that it falls apart the second you take it out of the box .
There is no good place to buy a dog .
Everybody says , " No !
Do n't go to the pet store !
They 're evil !
No !
Do n't go to the pound !
Those dogs are are bad !
No !
Do n't go to that breeder !
They are even eviler than the pet store ! "
There is no non-evil place you can go to get a dog apparently .
Everybody says do your research .
I did more research looking for a dog than they do trying to cure AIDS .
Fed up , I went to my best friend in life Pete .
I said , Pete , I 'm looking for a dog and I need some advice .
He says , " Well , what kind of breed are you looking at ? "
Golden retriever , like the one in the hit movie Homeward Bound , I say .
" Nah , those dogs got all sorts of problems . "
Well , what about a collie .
" No sir , those dogs are too uptight . "
Okay , beagles seem cool .
" Don't .
Everybody will think you got it just because of Snoopy . "
Dejected , I walked home and discovered my house had been robbed .
Then you finally get a dog from a place that was somehow approved by everybody you know and it managed to survive the first two weeks in your home .
It 's fun for a while but then you stand around while the dog breaks everything you own and defiles your wife .
You say to yourself , " You know , this is nice , but it 's missing something ... "
Dog and Boat
Dog on a boat .
Now we 're talking .
Now you see where I 'm going with this .
When a dog is on a boat it calms them the hell down for once in your miserable life and they just stand there with a dumb look on their face .
It takes the seemingly limitless majesty of the Earth 's ocean to calm a dog down for one second .
Many people take this time to enjoy a nice moment together with their dog .
Nothing gay though .
It 's not like that .
It 's stimuli overload for a dog .
The dog 's brain is n't fast enough to process the scenery , the sun , the wind , the noise and the incredible amount of ugly , ugly birds and will just sit there stuck in an infinite loop while it 's brain struggles to catch up .
That 's my dream in life .
To have a boat and a dog and combine the two .
No moochy women , no judgmental friends , just me and my dog sailing the open ocean but not too far away from land because there are pirates out there .
Not the eye patch and parrot type but the fucked up rocket launcher type .

Bangalore 's hi-tech enclaves are an oasis of excellence
With its economy growing at more than triple the speed of Britain's , India has become a global leader in information technology and other hi-tech products .
But how has this been possible in a country where poverty is so widespread and where more than a third of people are still illiterate ?
In the words of Nobel laureate economist Amartya Sen , " the danger of India moving in the direction of being half California and half sub-Saharan Africa is a real one . "
The contrast between hi-tech , silicon enclaves such as Bangalore and the primitive conditions of many Indian villages and urban slums strikes even the most casual tourist .
So is the dramatic rise of Indian IT firms just a Californian bubble in the sub-Saharan deserts of Indian poverty ?
Not according to Anand Mahindra , managing director of a family business , Mahindra and Mahindra , that has grown into one of India 's largest conglomerates , producing everything from tractors to telecommunications .
If you want to make a million Barbie dolls , this is not the place to come
Anand Mahindra
" The IT sector was a kicker to growth , " he says .
" Its impact was psychological .
It signalled to the world that India was much more than its old historical stereotypes .
" It suddenly in an exaggerated manner , if you ask me , made the world think that every Indian was smart and could fix their computers .
" But that helped entrepreneurs in India from all industry segments , because it gave them a more receptive environment in which to do business . "
The number of Indian IT professionals has leapt from 56,000 in 1991 to a million today .
That 's still tiny relative to a population of over a billion , but a rare achievement in a global market where IT has traditionally been the preserve of advanced industrial economies .
Reliability costs
But how do hi-tech Indian companies survive and prosper in an environment where even basic infrastructure like transport , power and water is so notoriously unreliable ?
Phiroz Vandrevala , executive director of Tata Consultancy Services , India 's oldest and largest IT firm , says : " What we 've actually done is within our own environments created global circles , oases of excellence .
" So if we build any facility , we create a 24 - hour power back - up , " he says , " or if you employ x number of people , you actually transport everybody from their home to their place of work . "
" But it certainly is a cost to doing business . "
While IT firms are cocooned within their oases of excellence , poor infrastructure can be a crippling cost for other sectors , such as large - scale manufacturing .
Anand Mahindra , whom many consider the sub - continent 's most thoughtful businessman , warns that India cannot live by IT alone .
" Even Bill Gates when he came to India said , 'IT is not the answer for employment .
You 're going to have to emulate China and its manufacturing sector , because that 's where the jobs are and that 's where the multiplier effect is the highest , ' " says Mr Mahindra .
" So it was a nice , sobering thought to come from the Messiah of IT himself .
" If you want to make a million Barbie dolls , this is not the place to come .
Then you go to China .
This is not a widget - making manufacturing economy , and that is largely and possibly only due to our poor infrastructure .
" We simply do n't have the power in terms of energy to meet such high capacities .
We do n't have the port infrastructure and the transportation infrastructure to ship out such a high volume of goods in a reliable and timely manner . "
Education , education
So instead of making widgets , Indian manufacturing is currently building on its comparative advantages in engineering - intensive goods , which require versatility , flexibility and innovation .
One example is carmaking , with domestic and foreign firms now investing an estimated $ 6.6 bn in new Indian factories .
Manufacturing is the backbone of India 's strong economic growth
But growth in these high - value sectors is also running up against a skills shortage fuelled by lack of what 's called social infrastructure - primarily good education .
Although Indian universities churn out three million graduates a year , only 15 % of them are suitable employees for blue - chip companies .
That 's nowhere near enough for Phiroz Vandrevala of Tata Consultancy Services .
" We have a tremendous amount of availability , but the suitability quotient is slightly low .
If you look at about a hundred engineers from different educational institutions , in a company like ours about 20 % make the cut , " says Mr Vandrevala .
" Every industry is going to have to make significant investments in training for their own skills . "
Despite growing investment in education , India still lags way behind its Western competitors .
Thirty - five per cent of its population is still illiterate ; only 15 % of Indian students reach high school , and just 7 % graduate .
Change is messy
Privatisations , or at least public - private partnerships , are now widely seen as the way to open up essential infrastructure like education , transport , power and even water to competition and new investment .
But local delivery depends on the quality of local leadership and its willingness to cut back its own powers .
Indian democracy undoubtedly makes structural change a lot slower and more messy than in China , but there is genuine optimism among Indian economists that the system will eventually deliver .
" Our confidence in rapid growth is quite recent , because rapid growth itself is recent , and so for the state to gear up to provide the infrastructure that 's appropriate for 8 to 9 % growth is taking a while , " says Suman Bery , head of a leading Delhi think - tank called the National Council for Advanced Economic Research .
" We 're not one of these countries like France or China which does things in advance and pre-emptively .
" The shoe has to pinch before we get round to it .
" Infrastructure strikes me as an issue that will solve itself .
It may hold growth back a little bit , but I do n't think it 's fatal . "

Six years ago today the state of Texas executed an FBI agent , a state district judge , the president of Kenya and a war hero who commanded a nuclear - powered submarine during the Civil War .
More aptly put , Texas executed a seriously mental ill inmate named Monty Allen Delk who , at varying times , believed he was all of these things .
Delk was convicted and sentenced to death for the murder of Gene “ Bubba ” Allen of Anderson County in East Texas .
Although the state of Texas maintained that Delk was “ malingering , ” i.e. , pretending to be mentally ill to stave off execution , the prison system ’s former chief mental health officer stated that Delk suffered from a severe mental illness , one that had become progressive in nature since it was first noticed in 1989 –- years after Delk was tried and convicted .
A close examination of the Delk case reveals yet another significant flaw in the capital punishment system :
The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that executing severely mentally ill inmates violates the U.S. Constitution .
The court also has held that a death row inmate must be mentally competent in order to drop his appeals .
But the court has not directly addressed the issue of whether a death row inmate must be mentally competent in order to pursue his state and federal habeas appeals .
In fact , the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals , and the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals , which has jurisdiction over death penalty cases in Texas , have ruled that prisoner competence during state and federal habeas proceedings is not constitutionally required .
The question is fundamental to due process .
Habeas is the first , last and often only avenue of appeal for death row inmates whose sentences have been upheld on direct appeal by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals .
But because Delk was unable to assist his attorney through his habeas appeals , he could not answer simple questions that were key to his case -– questions such as , did he commit the crime ?
Did he think his trial was fair ?
Did he think his trial lawyers adequately represented him ?
Were there circumstances about the crime or about his personal history that mitigated against a death sentence ?
The fact that Delk ’s execution was allowed to proceed represented a three - pronged failure on the part of Texas ’ death penalty system .
The first failure must be attributed to the courts , which failed to order a psychiatric evaluation of Delk , despite repeated requests by Delk ’s very able attorney , John Wright of Huntsville .
The second failure lies with Texas ’ executive clemency system .
Because of his mental illness , Delk ’s sentence should have been commuted to life in prison .
Yet the Board of Pardons and Paroles as well as Texas Gov. Rick Perry did nothing .
( It is important to note that four days before Delk ’s execution , the Georgia Parole Board , acting in a similar case , commuted death row inmate Alexander Williams sentence to life in prison after pleas from human rights activists .
Williams is a chronic paranoid schizophrenic who thinks Sigourney Weaver is God and that little green frogs are in his prison cell , staring at him . )
The third failure rested with the Texas media .
While Williams ’ case attracted comprehensive media coverage in Georgia and beyond , newspapers in Texas largely failed to investigate Delk ’s case .
Government -– including the criminal justice system –- works best under the glare of public scrutiny .
Absent such scrutiny , abuses occur .
In this case , no one outside Texas ’ fervent anti-death penalty community took much notice of Delk ’s execution .
The good news is Texas ’ newspapers are beginning to sit up and take notice .
If I am not mistaken , every major Texas newspaper has called either for abolition of the death penalty or for a moratorium on executions .
The issue of capital punishment has advanced from the margins to the mainstream .
In today ’s climate , one wonders whether Texas officials could get away with executing a person as severely mentally ill as Delk .
Ultimately , the Supreme Court will have to directly confront the issue of whether a death - sentenced prisoner need be mentally competent during his habeas appeals .
Until that happens , we simply will have to ask ourselves a key question :
Is executing someone who is so severely mentally ill he does not know who he is not the very definition of an insane act ?

Background Converge traces its heritage back to languages as diverse as Python , Haskell , Icon and Smalltalk .
It is intended to be an utterly practical , modern programming language , mixing proven elements from different sources into one coherent whole .
Both language and libraries aim for clean design with a firm emphasis on pragmatics .
Common idioms are easily expressed , while still allowing complex concepts to be expressed neatly .
Importantly , Converge does not aim to be merely a minor re-configuration of features from well - known languages : it aims to innovate , and to give to the programmer a new way of looking at programming .
If you 're frustrated by your current language of choice , Converge might be for you .
Hello world !
Converge has a Python - esque indentation syntax .
The minimal hello world !
program in Converge looks as follows : import Sys func main ( ) : Sys : : println ( " Hello world ! " )
Generating code with compile - time meta- programming Converge implements a full Compile - Time Meta - Programming ( CTMP ) facility .
At a simple level , this can be seen as a macro - like facility , although it is more powerful than most existing macro facilities as arbitrary code can be run at compile - time .
Using this , one can interact with the compiler , and generate code safely and easily as ITrees ( a.k.a. abstract syntax trees ) .
As a simple example , one can pre-compute the 30th entry in the Fibonacci sequence ( computationally , a fairly expensive operation ) : func fib( n ) : if n == 0 : return 0 elif n == 1 : return 1 else : return fib(n - 1 ) + fib(n - 2 ) fib30 := $ < CEI :: lift ( fib ( 30 ) ) >
When this program is compiled , the splice $ <...> is evaluated at compile - time .
This particular splice calculates the 30th entry in the Fibonacci sequence , lifts the result into an ITree ( an AST of an integer ) and assigns it to fib30 .
When the resulting binary is run , the required Fibonacci number can be referenced rather than calculated .
How about caching the first n entries of the Fibonacci sequence ?
It 's easily done : func fibs_upto( n ) : fibs := [ ]
i := 0 while i < n : fibs.append ( fib( i ) ) i += 1 return CEI : : lift ( fibs ) cfibs := $ < fibs_upto( 30 ) >
This makes the resulting binary run approximately 400 times faster .
Of course , generating little examples like this is trivial .
But Converge makes building large Abstract Syntax Trees ( ASTs ) easy via quasi-quoting , which allows ASTs to be built using concrete syntax .
Simply surround normal expressions with [ | ... | ] to generate the corresponding AST .
Domain specific language implementation
There 's only so much pre-caching of results one can do .
Converge allows Domain Specific Languages ( DSLs ) of arbitrary syntaxes to be embedded into it .
Would n't it be fun to see how the fib function would look in an idealised assembly language that abstracts away from the specifics of a real - world processor ?
Normally this would involve flex , yacc , head scratching , and an implementation so fragile that it only works under a full moon .
In Converge , a simple layer atop CTMP means that a 10 Kb DSL implementation makes it easy to define our own personal assembly language .
With this we can then define an interactive version of fib which asks the user for a number in the Fibonacci sequence and prints it out : import WSI_Asm func main ( ) : test := $< >: SWI inputi CALL fib SWI printi SWI exit // // fib(n ) reads in an int on R0 and outputs an int on R0 . // fib : //
This routine corrupts R1 and R2 , so push them onto the stack .
PUSH R1 PUSH R2 IF R0 == 0 JMP fib0 // fib(0 ) == 0 IF R0 == 1 JMP fib1 // fib ( 1 ) == 1 // fib(n ) where n > 1 R1 := R0 R0 := R1 - 1 CALL fib R2 := R0 R0 := R1 - 2 CALL fib R0 := R2 + R0 JMP fib_finish fib0 : // fib(0 ) == 0 R0 := 0 JMP fib_finish fib1 : // fib( 1 ) == 1 R0 := 1 fib_finish : POP R2 POP R1 RTN test.new ( ) .exec ()
You can see the full source code for this example in the Converge distribution .
As you can imagine , the only limit to the DSLs you can embed is your imagination .
There 's no requirement that DSLs be related to computing technology as in the above example - DSLs already implemented in Converge have ranged from insurance DSLs to web DSLs .
Converge gives you unparalleled help in all the so - called trivial - but actually vitally important - issues such as parsing and error - checking .
Expression evaluation Converge 's expression evaluation system initially appears to be identical to standard languages .
Scratch a bit deeper and you 'll see that something slightly different is going on .
In Converge virtually everything is an expression .
Unlike most languages , expressions either succeed - in which case they also return a value - or they fail - in which case no value is produced .
Building upon this concept , Converge has full generators - functions which can generate multiple values and which can be involved in a limited form of backtracking .
Generators allow one to naturally redefine the fib function to be a generator producing all Fibonacci numbers from 0 to n : func fib( n ) : i := 0 j := 1 while n > 0 : j_old := j j := i + j i := j_old yield i n -= 1 fail func fibs_upto( n ) : fibs := [ ] for fibs .
append ( fib(n ) ) return CEI : : lift ( fibs ) cfibs := $ < fibs_upto( 30 ) >
Appropriate use of Converge 's expression evaluation semantics can lead to unusually elegant code .

There 's a lot more to find out about Converge .
If your appetite 's been whetted , the documentation contains much more information , including a more gentle introduction , and of course you can see example code when you download Converge .
Sadly , the racist whisper campaign continues .
This time though , an aide to Republican presidential candidate John McCain has been proven to be directly involved .
TPM Election Central has the story :
A McCain campaign aide actively pushed an incendiary , racially - charged video that uses the controversial words of Barack Obama 's pastor to tar Obama as unpatriotic -- despite the fact that McCain himself has suggested that Obama should n't be held accountable for Wright 's views .
The aide , Soren Dayton , who works in McCain 's political department , has been suspended from the campaign , a McCain spokesperson , Jill Hazelbaker , confimed to me .
The move by McCain 's aide could create controversy for the McCain camp , because the video itself is thoroughly reprehensible -- it interweaves footage of Obama explaining why he wo n't wear the American flag pin , Wright saying " God damn America , " Malcolm X , and Obama 's wife saying that his candidacy has made him proud of America for the " first time . "
Suspended ?
Instead of fired ?
Well , that is a maverick move .
I 'd say he should have been fired on the spot .
No , do n't clean out your desk , do n't say your goodbyes .
Put your keys on the desk , get your coat , and head to the door .
It must not be tolerated .
These racist whisper / viral vile video campaigns must be stopped in their tracks .
If any political operatives are involved , I 'd say you are " on notice . "
Update : The Politico reports the video was made by a prominent conservative talk radio producer :
Rather .
the incendiary video — which also includes footage of Malcolm X , the U.S. Olympians who raised their hand in the black power salute and the song " Fight the Power " — is in part the amateur work of Lee Habeeb .
A former producer of " The Laura Ingraham Show , " Habeeb is the director of strategic content at Salem Radio Network , the conservative talk radio powerhouse that airs programs hosted by figures such as Bill Bennett and Hugh Hewitt " I 'm trying to join the YouTube generation and have some fun , " Habeeb explained when asked in a telephone interview why he created the video .
" We wanted to see if we could get [ it ] in circulation . "
He later admitted that he did n't create it by himself :
F RESNO , CALIFORNIA —
Hey , you want to hear the New World whining at Old Europe ?
Here it is , from a press conference Condi Rice gave about Kosovo : " I mean after all , we 're talking about something from 1389 .
1389 !
It 's time to move forward .
And Serbia needs to move forward .
Kosovo needs to move forward .
Browse Column " Well , I think we can all agree that 1389 was a while back , and that all things considered , " forward " is generally a good way to go .
And not just for Serbia .
No , Ma’am .
It applies just as much to Kosovo .
" But hold on , Gary , " you may be yelling at your computer , " what ’s all this about 1389 anyway ? "
Well , as historical expert types like me and Condi know , that happens to be the date of one of the coolest battles in history .
And since it happened in Kosovo , they decided to call it the Battle of Kosovo .
I ’ll get to the battle in a minute -- it ’s a glorious battle and deserves retelling -- but first I want to talk about Condi ’s tantrum over people caring about stuff that happened long ago .
I ’ve heard this a lot : " Ca n’t they just get over it ? "
There ’s some rule in California , it ’s like a misdemeanor to care about anything that happened more than a week ago .
And Condi , the all - American spinster , picked up that notion and ran with it , because as we all know Condi had to be twice as dull as her rivals .
So here ’s Condi solving the problems of Balkan history in a mall - girl whine : " I mean come ON !
1389 ?
I was n’t even BORN then ! "
Serbs just can't " get over it . "
Well , Condi , have a seat on that mall ottoman , the one between the American Eagle store and the foodcourt , and let Uncle Gary tell you something very important :
You see , L’il Condi , some people actually care about stuff that happened a long time ago .
Yeah , seriously .
Like , for example , me .
I care more about one particular day in 1779 than I do about my whole sophomore year in high school .
Because on September 23 , 1779 a Scottish - American rebel privateer named John Paul Jones maneuvered his soggy old raider , the Bon Homme Richard , next to a much bigger British warship , the Serapis , and lashed the ships together to make sure no quarter could be asked or given .
And even though the Brits blew his little ship apart right under him , Jones refused to surrender and scared his Brit counterparts into surrendering themselves .
That day gave me a reason to live .
All my sophomore year gave me was the strong impression that people were stupid and nasty .
So excuse me , Condi , I ’ll take 1779 .
A lot of people will take any year in the past over a lot of years in the present .
And the year 1389 , the one you want the Serbs to get over ?
Well , 1389 means even more to the Serbs than Jones ’ victory means to me .
The battle they fought against the Turks that year is the main plotline in every song and story the Serbs tell to this day .
It taught generations of Serb boys what was expected of them , how honorable warriors are supposed to act .
I suspect Condi ’s other , deeper problem with the Serbs ’ 1389 - ophilia is that the Serbs did n’t even win that day .
Talk about un-American !
They hang around dreaming of this old battle , and it was a defeat ?
Gawd , get a life !
Well , not everybody wants a life , Condi .
There ’s a lot to be said for glorious death instead .
Ever read the Bible , for example ?
Not that you have to .
A lot of the great old European warrior stories are about defeats .
The Anglo - Saxons sang about getting stomped by the Vikings at Maldon , and the Franks just could n’t get enough of the Song of Roland , which is a whole epic poem about how Roland , Charlemagne ’s Custer , lost his whole command .
They should do a poster of that battle , with Roland as this Conan - the - Barbarian hero battling to the end , surrounded by hacked Saracens , wearing a t - shirt that says , " It ’s a Euro thing , you would n’t understand . "
But if you really try , you can see the appeal yourself .
I mean , take Custer .
If he ’d won , wiped out the Sioux at the Little Big Horn , would anybody remember him now ?
It ’d be kind of a bummer , actually .
Much cooler to die fighting , like those old paintings show him , hat off and hair flying in the wind , drawing scalp - hunters from all over the Plains .
If you think about how cool Custer ’s defeat was , it ’s easier to understand the Shia , who whip themselves every year to get into the spirit of Hussein ’s all - time one - sided defeat at Karbala ( " Anguish " ) , where he charged the Caliph ’s entire army with 30 companions .
Makes the charge of the Light Brigade look like a game of touch football at the Kennedy compound .
Nope , there ’s no doubt about it : defeat is sweeter than victory any day , unless it actually happens to you .
Once you ’re safely under the sod and the battle is in the hands of the tribal bards , defeat is the best material around .
Poets love defeat , which makes sense if you remember the kind of people who wrote poetry at school .
The Serbs were a major power in 14th - century Europe .
People forget how much pure geographical luck , good or bad , makes or breaks countries .
Without the good luck of having the English Channel for a front lawn , Britain would have been toast a dozen times over .
And if the poor Hungarians had n’t been stuck guarding Europe ’s back door when the Mongols came calling , they might have ended up the dominant power on the Continent .
Serbia was another up - and - comer until it had the bad luck to run into the Turkish offensive line .
The Serbs were always the best warriors in the Balkans , and under King Dusan the Great , they smashed their way down into Albania , Macedonia and Northern Greece .
Belgrade , their capital today , was back then at the northern edge of Serbia .
The real heartland of Serbia was -- you guessed it -- Kosovo .
The Turks were on a tear of their own .
They still had n’t taken Constantinople , and would n’t for another 60 - odd years , but they ’d long since bypassed it to establish a foothold in Europe , from which they pushed further , year by year , doing deals when it suited them , or just plain crushing anybody who was n’t open to negotiating the Turkish way .
The battle of Kosovo was one of those classic match - ups : Serbs pushing south and east meet Turks pushing north and west .
The Turks were some of your more interesting conquerors : goofy , ruthless and sly .
You never knew which kind of Turk you were going to meet on a given day , the kind who were totally willing to take in a Christian vassal state and offer a friendly exchange of harem boys to seal the deal , or the kind who liked to sit on big pillows and think of new ways to make infidels die more slowly and painfully than any have died before .
The Serb legends say that the Serbs ’ King Lazar could have made a deal with the Turkish sultan Murad I , but Lazar had some wacko dream where the angels told him to take the kingdom in heaven over one on earth .
Like a bad contestant on Let ’s Make A Deal , the idiot chose the kingdom in heaven -- at least , that ’s the way the Serbs tell it .
I just wish the angels would offer me a deal like that , just once .
You ’d see me sign on the dotted line for the earthly kingdom offered to me so fast you ’d hardly have time to pack before my goon squads arrived to throw you in the dungeons .
And my dungeons -- let ’s just say they ’d be very special dungeons , dungeons I ’ve been planning in my head since well before sophomore year .
Okay , enough daydreaming .
Lazar probably was n’t the brightest king on the block .
He should have taken the deal .
But if you look at the paintings of him he looks like one of these ruddy stocky type - A guys with high blood pressure who wake up angry and stay that way all day .
Well , the Turks cured that blood pressure problem in one day .
The reason Lazar should have taken the deal was because the Sultan had a huge army , at least 40,000 men , a massive number for pre-antibiotic days .
And maybe 4,000 of those were the Janissaries , Christian boys grabbed from their mommies as a kind of infidel tax , taken to Istanbul to be brainwashed into Muslim fanatics and turned loose on the Sultan ’s enemies .
You have to admire that , taking the little infidel kiddies and turning them into Muzzie stormtroopers .
I mean , just because you ’re a world conqueror does n’t mean you ca n’t have a sense of humor .
Lazar ’s Serbs had a pretty good force of their own , maybe 20,000 men-- including a few Croats , which is really amazing because if you know anything about the Balkans you know Croats go completely apeshit with hatred when you even mention Serbs , like that big jock in the movie who used to sniff the air and go , " NERDS ! " when some math geek was in smell range .
But the Croats could see the Turks coming their way , and had the sense to fight with the Serbs to try to stop them before they reached Croat - land .
It ’s actually pretty classic gang - war logic : the 12th Street boys may love to fight the 14th Street kids , but if some gang from out of town shows up , they ’re going to unite against it .
Or pretend to .
Because that ’s the other classic element here , treachery : one of the Turks ’ big assets was a traitor Serb noble , Dejanovic , who knew the territory and acted like their Indian scout , hoping to share the spoils .
Serbs having a hard time " getting over " the loss of Kosovo The Serbs were fighting on their home field , but the Turks were professionals , vets with dozens of battles all over the Balkans to their credit .
The Turks also had clear superiority in armor and weapons over the Serbs , who had panic - mustered every stable boy and dirt farmer they could find , even if they had no armor or proper weapons .
One of the coolest features of the Serb force is that they had what European armies never seemed to have : mounted archers .
Even so , most accounts of the battle spend a lot of time talking about the powerful volley of Turkish arrows that started the battle , so reading between the lines -- which you absolutely have to do to make any sense of these old ballads -- it seems like Kosovo started out as the classic encounter between European tactics , shield wall and heavy cavalry , vs. Steppe warfare : long - range arrow bombardment and maneuver .
The Serbs did what European armies always did best : they charged , and smashed right into the Ottoman force .
Eastern armies were always impressed with what those white boys on their big plow horses could do on a flat field , with room to get up speed .
There ’s an Arab saying that dates from the Crusades : " The charge of a Frank ( European ) could knock down the walls of Babylon . "
But there ’s another truism about cavalry charges : unless they were supported by infantry , cavalry battles usually dissolved into " melees , " meaning a bunch of individual duels between sweaty grunting tired guys on sweaty grunting tired horses .
A few bold horsemen can make a big dent in the enemy line , but if the enemy has the discipline to stay in formation and the numbers to plug the dent , then eventually numbers will tell .
That ’s what happened at Kosovo , as the day wore on and everybody ’s hacking arms got tired : the Serb charge was absorbed , stopped and finally reversed as the Turks committed more troops to battle .
There are times in war when courage is a bad idea .
After Stalingrad the Germans should probably have surrendered on the Western Front , applied for admission as the 51st State and hoped for the best .
All they got for the long years of hopeless fighting after that defeat was a few million casualties and a badass rep that got their logo put on a lot of bikers ’ helmets .
Not much of a return on investment .
And when you ’ve lost the battle , like the Serbs had at Kosovo by that point , then the idea of doing the noble thing , sticking around to get wiped out , is n’t a very good idea .
Unless you ’re thinking about all the art that it ’ll inspire : you know , sad songs , sad paintings , sad stories .
The Serbs have lots of those , all about Kosovo , and all about how they got wiped out as the afternoon wore on .
There ’s a famous painting of a dead Serb warrior with this medieval hippie Serb girl weeping over him that kind of sums up the whole necrophilia thing here .
I can see the appeal of it , probably way more than most Americans can , but I have to be honest : if it came to lying dead there and getting a kiss vs. having a Corvette and driving to Malibu with her — you know , both of us alive and all — I ’ll take the Malibu option .
( But since Malibu ai n’t an option for me and for just about everyone else , all we ’ve got is the 1389 option . )
What ’s cooler are the funny lines the Serbs have their heroes saying to each other as they get slaughtered , like : " If every one of us turned into a grain of salt , we would n’t be enough to salt the Sultan ’s dinner ! "
Ho - ho - ho , and now let ’s politely get hacked to death .
The consolation prize in Kosovo was a kiss and a drink
But for a really pro-active , mentally healthy response to defeat , give me my all - time favorite Serb : Milos Obilic .
Milos , a Serb warrior who saw his comrades slaughtered at Kosovo , did n’t just moan and groan in defeat .
No , he took action .
What happened was , when the Sultan , Murad came out of his pavilion to wander over the battlefield and gloat over all the dead Christians , Milos played dead .
When the Sultan got within stabbin ’ range , Milos jumped up and gave Murad the biggest , and last , surprise of his life .
Yes , thanks to a Serb , Murad the First became the first and last Ottoman sultan to die on the battlefield .
Sultans did n’t specialize in leading from the front .
What the Sultans did best , you can see from what happened when the Sultan ’s son Bayezid heard that Daddy had been sliced ’n diced by a bad sport from the losing team .
Bayezid , a born executive — God , I love this bit — Bayezid called his brother Yakub who was leading the other wing of the Ottoman Army : " Oh Yak -ky !
Yak - ky little brother , palsy - walsy … could you just come on over here for a sec ?
Dad left me a message for you ! "
Yakub came galloping over and Bayezid gave him the message : " The Sultan ’s throne is n’t big enough for the two of us , so …
Die you bastard , so I can be Sultan ! "
Of course Bayezid did n’t do the killing himself ; Sultans do n’t lower themselves to manual labor .
He had some eunuch strangle his little bro .
Killing your brothers ; one of the seven habits of successful sultans , an Ottoman business management best seller .
The Serbs lost a huge number of men that day .
So did the Ottomans , but they had a much bigger population to draw from .
That allowed them to keep sending out more and bigger invasion forces .
Even though the Serb nobles cut a deal at last , and stayed in power for another couple of generations , the whole of Serbia was inevitably absorbed into the Ottoman empire just around the time that the Turks finally took Constantinople .
By this time , the Austrians were terrified , and for good reason .
One - hundred - and - fifty years later , the Ottoman armies surged all the way to the walls of Vienna .
So the Austrians , like the cunning little cowards they ’ve always been , established a couple of Serb preserves , like Roosevelt did with the buffalo , to make sure the Serbs did n’t go extinct …
Real reason : so the Serbs could be their human buffer against an Ottoman attack .
You may have heard of the names of those Serb enclaves from the 1990s Balkan wars : Vojvodina and Krajina .
Krajina , a long swathe of ethnic Serb territory within current - day Croatia , was eventually ethnically cleansed by the Croats : thousands of Serbs killed and the rest , hundreds of thousands , burned out of their houses , thanks to a huge dose of U.S. military aid to the Croats , along with NATO jets and intelligence .
All this came after the Serbs beat the shit out of the Croats in their first fair fight in history .
And that ’s the lesson of Kosovo for the Serbs : we always fight better than our miserable enemies , and yet every time we get screwed .
Whether it ’s by the Ottomans in medieval times , or the Clintons in the 1990s , the basic blueprint was set right there on that one day in 1389 , all those years ago .
Just look what happened to Kosovo in 2008 , the wonderful Declaration of Independence that Condi Rice was gushing about .
Kosovo is now a fully independent " country " run by a cowardly Albanian mafia that lasted about five minutes in combat against middle - aged Serb militia units , then hid in the bushes until NATO bombed Serbia into submission , and rode back into power as victors all because the gullible Americans used their Air Force to bomb the Serbs into " getting over it " once and for all .
And now Condi just ca n’t understand how the Serbs have the nerve to be unhappy , just because their ancient homeland has been overrun with Albanians , whose main exports are popping out Muslim babies and running every mafia operation in Southern Europe .
Why do n’t the Serbs just deal , huh ?
Why do n’t they get a life , get over it , already ?
Correction to this article
WHEN the half - American Lieutenant Winston Churchill stood up in a ballroom at the Waldorf Astoria in 1900 to tell New York about the Boer war , Mark Twain was the man who introduced him .
No fan of either Britain 's imperial war in South Africa or America 's against Spain at about the same time , the writer spoke of the links between their two countries .
“ We have always been kin : kin in blood , kin in religion , kin in representative government , kin in ideals , kin in just and lofty purposes ; and now we are kin in sin , the harmony is complete , the blend is perfect , like Mr Churchill himself , whom I now have the honour to present to you . ”
A century and an unpopular joint invasion of Iraq later , George Bush and Gordon Brown spoke in similar vein at a Camp David press conference in July 2007 .
The president said the ties between Britain and America represented his country 's “ most important bilateral relationship ... primarily because we think the same , we believe in freedom and justice as fundamentals of life . ”
Not to be outdone in diplomatic boilerplate , Britain 's new prime minister spoke of “ shared values ... the belief in the dignity of the individual , the freedom and liberty that we can bring to the world ... ”
But are these Anglo - American values really so different from those that Britain shares with other rich democracies ?
On a state visit to London this week , Nicolas Sarkozy , France 's president , sought to rouse his hosts to a sense of their mission within Europe and to a “ nouvelle fraternité franco - britannique ” .
He too spoke of common values , and , perhaps more tellingly , of shared tastes in books and music .
His message was that of course both countries should work with America , but that theirs was a separate , and a shared , calling .
To turn over the supposed Anglo - American common ground more carefully , The Economist commissioned pollsters at YouGov in Britain and Polimetrix in America — supported by additional funds from the Hoover Institution , a California think - tank — to find out what people in both places thought about a number of social , political and economic matters .
A thousand people in each country were consulted between March 7th and 11th .
The full results , published here , present a nuanced picture of attitudes on both sides of the Atlantic .
Broadly , however , the differences between the two countries look more striking than the similarities .
Like most west Europeans , Britons tend to have more left - wing views than Americans , but the first chart shows that this is often by a surprising margin .
( “ Left ” and “ right ” are harder to locate than they were : here “ left ” implies a big - state , secular , socially liberal , internationalist and green outlook ; right , the reverse . )
The data are derived by subtracting left - wing answers from right - wing ones , for each country and for each main political grouping within each country .
A net minus rating suggests predominantly left - wing views and a positive rating suggests a preponderance of right - wing views .
The specific questions underlying this summary are set out in charts on the next two pages .
The gap between Britain and America is widest on religion : no surprise there , as Britain is famously a post - Christian society and Americans are , if anything , rediscovering the faith of their fathers .
But the difference in views is so wide that even British Conservatives are a great deal more secular than American Democrats are .
The two are a bit closer on social values ( abortion , homosexuality and so forth ) , and they overlap on ideology ( mainly , how active the state should be ) , with Britain 's Tories to the right of America 's Democrats .
They overlap again on how free their countries should be to intervene militarily ( both the Tories and Labour are more hawkish than the Democrats ) .
Britons are more international than the Americans , keener on free trade and globalisation .
Views coincide most nearly on climate change — ironically , the area where the two governments have been least in step .
These are , of course , average figures : there are plenty of American atheists and Britons who hate the state .
But the chart shows another thing too .
On five of the six groups of issues selected , American opinion is far more polarised than British ( only nationalism seems to unite America 's left and right ) .
Gone are the days when it was British politics that embraced political extremes and Americans looked on bemused .
The gap between Republicans and Democrats is almost always far greater than that between Tories and ( usually ) Liberal Democrats .
And that is another interesting discovery : Lib Dem supporters are to the left of Labour on every broad category except the role of the state .
Such nuggets abound .
Americans have a wider anti-big - business streak .
Britons are cooler on multiculturalism ( perhaps because they see more of it at home ) .
Britons are more willing than Americans to curb civil liberties in pursuit of security .
Americans are less keen not only on the United Nations ( no surprise ) but also on NATO — and more enthusiastic about the “ special relationship ” with Britain .
If the British could choose their leader from a host of recent Anglo - American greats , they would pick Bill Clinton before Tony Blair .
So would Americans , even if they may turn down his wife .
Of the current presidential candidates , British Tories would vote for Barack Obama ; Labour supporters prefer Hillary Clinton by a narrow margin .
Other questions elicit the more similar views that one would expect .
People in both places are worried about the economic future but still bullish on chances for bright kids from poor families .
They feel much the same about the death penalty : between a quarter and a fifth are opposed , the same proportion are in favour , and around half would support it in some circumstances .
Neither group is conspicuously thrilled by the idea of a Muslim president or prime minister .
Special , but not exclusive
This is all fascinating stuff for policy wonks , and readers are enthusiastically referred to our website for more of the same .
But do the differences we found matter ?
They might , for the world order is changing and its components are up for review .
Few agree on the nature , let alone the future , of the special relationship between Britain and America — a phrase coined by Churchill , sadder and wiser after the second world war had marked the end of one empire and the emergence of a mightier superpower .
To some who expected Britain to be Greece to America 's Rome , a counsellor in the weighty business of keeping order in the world , its former colony 's best friend in Europe and brother in arms around the globe , reality has been a bit of a let - down .
Things have n't happened quite like that , nor could they have done , given the great and growing disparity of military and economic power .
But for much of the past half - century , and certainly for the past quarter , Britain and America have mostly presented a common front on security and foreign affairs and more besides .
No British premier bet more heavily on the special relationship than Mr Brown 's predecessor .
Mr Blair flogged doggedly around the world to advance America 's aims in Afghanistan after terrorists pulled off the worst attack on mainland America since Mr Blair 's political forebears lost the battle for New Orleans in 1815 .
He paid a heavy price for committing British troops to Iraq alongside Mr Bush 's , losing popularity at home and influence in Europe .
But the notion of a distinct Anglo - American community of ideas and values goes beyond the whiff of now - defunct cordite .
Free - market economics and globalisation itself are often seen by others as essentially Anglo - Saxon constructs .
When the French voted against the proposed European Union constitution in 2005 , it was because , some said , it risked enshrining elements of the cut - and - thrust capitalism that is rampant in both Britain and America .
They preferred the continental model of social protection and cohesion , even at the cost of slower growth , to the precariousness and inequality of those countries ' thriving economies .
Walter Russell Mead , an American observer of foreign affairs , maintains that America and Britain act together so often not because they set out deliberately to do so but because they frequently reach similar conclusions on their own .
“ The family resemblance is so strong that even our most casual acquaintances can see that we are related , ” he writes in “ God and Gold ” , a good recent book .
Ronald Reagan confessed to a feeling of “ homecoming ” when he addressed Parliament in 1982 .
Many Britons travelling in America find it more familiar than one would expect just from speaking the same language and bathing from birth in Hollywood 's offerings .
So some sort of Anglo - Saxon particularity appears to exist ; and complacent , even triumphant , America and Britain have urged on the rest of the world their own prescriptions : lightly - regulated capitalism red in tooth and claw at home , and military intervention where needed to promote democracy around the world .
Both seem rather less than winning strategies these days .
War in Iraq and Afghanistan has so far created more problems that it has solved .
America 's current economic woes look likely to find their worst reflection in Britain , thanks to the sophistication of global high finance in which British and American firms dominate .
China and India are coming up fast as economic powers ; resource - rich Russia is throwing its weight around again ; and the EU , with a new operating treaty within its grasp , is emerging as a more coherent force .
Domestic political changes too are altering the old equation .
Labour , in power for over a decade , is trailing the Conservative Party in the polls .
Mr Bush is more likely than not to cede the Oval Office to a Democrat next year .
And Mr Sarkozy is proposing a more active role for himself as partner to both Britain and America .
So what next for the Anglo - Saxon alliance ?
In their fundamental attitudes — regarding religion , society , the role of the state — Britons are more similar to their western European neighbours ( and Canadians ) than they are to the United States .
In foreign affairs and security matters , however , they usually stand somewhere between the two .
Even though use of the term is said to be discouraged at the British Embassy in Washington , it is certainly too soon to write off the special relationship .
Two research outfits in Washington , DC , the Pew Research Centre and the German Marshall Fund , conduct regular surveys on global attitudes .
Andrew Kohut , the president of the Pew Research Centre , points out that , although enthusiasm for America has slipped since 2000 , a majority of people in Britain , unlike those in the rest of the big countries in his survey , still give America a favourable rating overall : 51 % , compared with 39 % of French people and 30 % of Germans .
Americans are far warmer towards Britons ( and Canadians ) than towards their other allies .
In the deep divide over the use of military force that has marked America 's relations with Europe since the start of the Iraq war , Britain , again , is western Europe 's outlier .
In polling for its 2007 Transatlantic Trends report , the German Marshall Fund found that whereas 74 % of Americans believed that war is sometimes necessary to obtain justice , around 66 % of Europeans thought the opposite .
Britain echoed America : 59 % agreed that military action may be justified in such circumstances .
But John K. Glenn , who heads the project , believes that America and Europe are nonetheless converging on some issues , principally on the threats that face them .
Europeans are more alarmed than they were about Islamist fundamentalism , for example , and America is waking up to global warming .
And he notes that on some questions about the use of force France is as close to America as Britain is .
Welcome to London , Mr Sarkozy .
Correction :
We had stated wrongly that both populations are broadly against the death penalty .
In fact , the wording of the most - chosen answer to the survey 's relevant question indicates broad if qualified support for the death penalty , among both Americans and Britons .

The Church of Scientology strikes back !
Online .
Having grown tired of being hounded on the internet by the anonymous cyber - protest group " Anonymous , " Scientology not only filed an injunction in court ( which failed ) , but also posted its own counterattack videos to YouTube .
Under the account name " AnonymousFacts , " the main video charges the group with " hate crimes " against Scientology — characterizing the group as terrorists .
Scientology also made separate videos " exposing " several individual members of Anonymous .
And someone submitted those videos to Digg , and even started Wikipedia entries attacking the Anonymous members .
It 's a significantly different — and more sophisticated — strategy for Scientology , which usually relies on secrecy , intimidation , and litigation to get its way , rather than trawling for internet influence .
The four full videos are below :
First is the main one , " Anonymous - Hate Crimes & Terrorism Directed At Scientology , " followed by three separate videos aimed at exposing specific Anonymous members .
Amnesty International brought the men together in New York before a hearing of the human rights committee of the UN tomorrow that will call for a moratorium on executions around the world as a first step towards abolishing the death penalty .
It is the ultimate argument , the campaign believes - the testimony of individuals who managed to survive the system , but who came close to being killed despite their innocence .
Venezuela became the first country to remove the death penalty in 1853 , and the abolition movement has grown , with 133 states members .
Britain abolished the penalty in 1967 .
As countries drop away , attention focuses on the remaining practitioners .
Last year at least 1,591 people were put to death in 25 nations , but 91 % of those were executed in six countries : China , Iran , Pakistan , Iraq , Sudan and the US .
China is known to have executed more than 1,000 prisoners in 2006 , but the real figure may be closer to 8,000 .
Twelve US states put a total of 53 people to death last year , but the practice has fallen to its lowest level in a decade after the supreme court decided to hear arguments about the humanity of the lethal injection method .
The UN resolution , backed by 72 countries including the 27 - nation EU , has no power to enforce a moratorium , but it is seen by campaigners as a chance to apply pressure for reform on those countries teetering on abolition .
Amnesty 's death row expert , Piers Bannister , said the men's stories " provide graphic evidence that the death penalty is administered by flawed systems that put innocent people at risk " .
Edward Edmary Mpagi
Mpagi spent 18 years on death row in Uganda .
The hardest moments were when fellow inmates were taken away from their cells , leaving him to wonder if it would be his turn next .
He counted 52 men who were taken for execution , often in batches of 10 or 11 at a time .
The first thing prisoners would know would be a feeling in the air , what Mpagi calls " something fishy " .
Then the prison guards would take an inmate away .
The other prisoners would shout " So - and - so is going ! " and the condemned man would cry : " I am going !
I am going to meet my Lord ! "
Then there would be a three - day period while the condemned men were allowed to prepare themselves for death and take their last rites from a priest .
Mpagi would hear the men singing to keep up their spirits .
At the end of the three days , he would hear them being led to the execution chamber , and then the thud of the body as it fell from the gallows .
Finally , the sound of nails being knocked into coffins .
Only then , when all the men had been hanged , would he be able to relax .
" You think , ' It could be me .
Maybe this time I am going ' .
Only when the exercise is over does your heart come back .
Until then , there is great fear . "
He was arrested , aged 27 , in 1981 and sentenced to death the next year for the murder of a neighbour in Masaka .
Mpagi thought he saw the dead man , George William Wandyaka , standing at the back of the court during the trial .
A few years later , further sightings were made of the man in Jinja , in eastern Uganda .
It transpired that Wandyaka 's parents had carried a grudge against Mpagi 's parents , and had staged the murder to hurt them .
In 1989 , the authorities in Masaka confirmed that Wandyaka was alive , and informed the attorney general , though Mpagi remained on death row for a further 11 years .
Since coming off death row he has dedicated himself to campaigning against executions .
A devout Christian , he says he has forgiven all those involved with what happened to him , even Wandyaka who died in 2002 before Mpagi had the chance to meet him .
Ray Krone
In 2002 Ray Krone became the 100th death row prisoner to be freed in the US .
He was your model citizen at the time of his arrest on New Year 's Eve , 1991 , aged 35 .
He had served in the US Air Force for six years and had a spotless criminal record .
" I was the kind of guy who , if you had broken down in your car in the middle of the night , you could call up and I would come . "
Then it all went wrong .
A barmaid was stabbed to death in the CBS Lounge where he used to drink near his home in Phoenix , Arizona .
Someone said that he had been having a relationship with the woman , which was not true , and a medical examiner matched his teeth to a bite mark found on the victim 's arm .
He was put on death row after a trial lasting barely three days .
For the first few months he was in despair .
" You keep thinking , ' Why me ' ? , beating yourself up , you think you can't live through this . "
But over time he came to realise that if he was to fight the system he had to understand how it worked .
He managed to get hold of legal books and study , and he kept pressing his case with the prison authorities .
In 2001 the state of Arizona made it easier for prisoners to gain access to DNA testing , and when the victim 's clothing was analysed , police databases threw up the name of a convicted sex offender who had been on parole at the time of the murder and staying at his mother 's house next to the CBS Lounge .
Krone was released the following year .
Before his arrest he supported the death penalty .
" I saw it as the end of the line , the just deserts for those who commit heinous crimes , " he says .
Now he campaigns against it .
" If they can do it to me , they can do it to anybody . "
Sakae Menda
Thirty - four years after he was sentenced to death for the murder of two people in Kumamoto , the southern Japanese island , Sakae Menda became the first prisoner on death row to be exonerated .
The authorities had the evidence they needed to prove that he was innocent , including a firm alibi and a statement from a witness saying that she had lied under duress , but he had to wait decades for them to act on it .
" Japanese law is very arbitrary , " Menda says .
He was 22 in 1949 when his world caved in .
He was staying at a motel that he discovered to be a brothel and got talking to a working girl who told him that her mother and a corrupt police officer had forced her into prostitution at the illegally young age of 16 .
When the officer found out , he decided to remove Menda as a potential threat by having the unrelated murder of two people pinned on him .
He forced a confession out of him .
Menda expected to be executed within six months .
Under the Japanese system , death row inmates , unless they are involved in legal appeals , can be taken away for execution at any time , with little notice .
He was ready to give up hope , until a Catholic priest encouraged him to seek a retrial .
" It 's harder to live than to die , " the priest told him .
From that day he never felt like giving up again .
" Whenever I saw inmates being taken away for execution - and there were about 35 of them during my time on death row - I would feel even stronger in my fight for my freedom . "
That freedom came in 1983 .
Japan 's death row remains in place and Menda continues to campaign against it .
" So long as people stand in judgment over others , mistakes will be made and innocent men will die , " he says .
How to migrate existing Windows installations to VirtualBox
Disclaimer : Migration of Windows guests from a physical host into a VirtualBox VM is not supported .
These instructions are provided as - is in the hope that they are helpful .
Windows installations , unlike Linux , cannot easily be moved from one hardware to another .
This is not just due to Microsoft 's activation mechanism but the fact that the installed kernel and drivers depend on the actual hardware .
This document explains the common pitfalls and how to workaround these .
We assume that either a physical Windows installation or a VMware image is the source of migration .
It is also assumed that a suitable virtual disk image ( either VDI or VMDK for VirtualBox >= 1.4 ) is already present .
There 's a step by step description below .
HAL
The hardware dependent portion of the Windows kernel is dubbed " Hardware Abstraction Layer " ( HAL ) .
While hardware vendor specific HALs have become very rare , there are still a number of HALs shipped by Microsoft .
Here are the most common HALs ( for more information , refer to this article : http://support.microsoft.com/kb/309283):
Hal.dll ( Standard PC )
( Standard PC ) Halacpi.dll ( ACPI HAL )
( ACPI HAL ) Halaacpi.dll ( ACPI HAL with IO APIC )
If you perform a Windows installation with default settings in VirtualBox , Halacpi.dll will be chosen as VirtualBox enables ACPI by default but disables the IO APIC by default .
A standard installation on a modern physical PC or VMware will usually result in Halaacpi.dll being chosen as most systems nowadays have an IO APIC and VMware chose to virtualize it by default ( VirtualBox disables the IO APIC because it is more expensive to virtualize than a standard PIC ) .
So as a first step , you either have to enable IO APIC support in VirtualBox or replace the HAL .
Replacing the HAL can be done by booting the VM from the Windows CD and performing a repair installation .
Hard Disk Support
For reasons we do n't understand , Windows memorizes which IDE / ATA controller it was installed on and fails to boot in case the controller changes .
This is very annoying because you will run into this problem with basically all migrated images .
The solution here is to perform several modifications to the Windows registry .
This can be done while the installation is still running on the original system because all it does is relax the IDE checks .
Therefore the installation will continue to work on the original system after the modification .
The easiest way is to use the excellent MergeIDE utility from the German c't computer magazine .
Alternatively , instructions in Microsoft 's knowledge base article can be followed : http://support.microsoft.com/kb/314082
agp440.sys / intelppm.sys
There are a few Windows device drivers that does not play nice on VirtualBox ' hardware .
Many physical PC systems ( and VMware ) have a AGP graphics bus which will cause agp440.sys to be installed .
VirtualBox ' virtual graphics card is on the PCI bus and the driver will cause a system crash .
The most correct approach is to boot the recovery console from the Windows installation CD and disable this service .
However , it is also possible to just rename / delete agp440.sys the C : \Windows \SYSTEM32 \drivers directory .
Here is a knowledge base article containing more information : http://support.microsoft.com/kb/324764
A similar problem may exist with intelppm.sys , which can also cause a hang of the guest OS .
Step By Step Instructions For Windows XP
This should work for Win2k Vista and Windows 7 as well , but it 's untested .
Earlier today , as a response to the controversy that has been brewing over Google 's decision to create custom 404 error pages , we asked Mashable readers to weigh in on whether or not they felt that Google was wrong to " hijack " the server error pages .
Overwhelmingly , the readers responded that they felt the practice was completely wrong of Google to pursue .
The comments on the poll , while not exhaustive , did n't do much to illuminate your reasons for picking as you did .
Chris Thomson weighed in on the question :
I think if they split the revenue from AdWords , that 'd be okay .
Seriously though , everyone should change their 404 page .
When I hosted with 1and1 , their default error page was a 1and1 - branded 404 page , equipped with THEIR ads , that THEY got paid for .
You could , of course , change this .
It 's similar with this , because Google does n't share the ad revenue with the site owner , and yet , you could decide to NOT have Google redirect your site ( make a custom 404 page ) .
And Max Roeleveld continued that thought :
Exactly .
Even then , it 's not like Google is visiting your server and making all kinds of changes there ; this only works for people that have the toolbar installed , and have chosen not to disable the feature .
From a user standpoint , Google 's 404 is an improvement over the standard 404 you get with Apache , and only as a last resort , search is offered .
No , I do n't think Google is Wrong .
If web masters do n't like this behaviour , they should do their job and provide some 404 that benefits visitors .
Those that are up in arms over this controversy have n't loudly spoken as to why it is this upsets them so much , and as such , I think that there must be a massive misunderstanding as to what exactly is going on here .
When you change your 404 page to be custom on your server , you can use it to redirect to whatever content you choose , and you can monetize it how you like .
If you leave it as a standard 404 that the server comes with , obviously you do n't really care what happens to that 404 traffic ( or otherwise you 'd be doing something about it ) .
For Google to essentially take that unwanted traffic and try to do something with it for folks that have their custom software installed in their browser is n't the height of evil .
It 's just being smart , and perhaps a bit helpful .
For my serialisation package ( more on that later ; the goals are to maintain sharing / circularity , minimise the number of copies for unboxed data and to support closures ) , I needed a way to quickly map from objects to some bookkeeping information .
At first , that was a hash table .
Unfortunately , there is considerable space overhead ( SBCL uses chained buckets , so there 's the array , the chain , and the key ) , which can easily destroy runtime on large enough data sets .
Finally , I found a rather hacky way to pin the serialised objects in place , which makes it possible to use raw addresses .
For numbers , I stuck to the hash table .
For everything else , however , I was looking for a relatively fast and reasonably space - efficient way to map from integers to objects .
Cuckoo hash tables spend too much time rehashing on grows .
Similarly , sparse vectors as a combination of a bitmask and a dense vector take too much time copying data into larger containers .
To avoid the problem of expensive grows , using some sort of tree structure seemed like a nice solution : each node contains much less data than the complete tree .
Unfortunately , trees often have a low branching factor , so a query ends up reading from many locations .
As soon as the tree becomes larger than cache , things get pretty ugly .
I wanted something with fat nodes , like B - trees .
However , finding the right child in a B - tree node is n't particularly cache - friendly either : a binary search is horrible for locality .
A correct solution would be to use a cache - aware ( ideally cache - oblivious , since I do n't like fiddling with magic constants ) layout , like van Emde Boas trees , or Bender , Demaine and Farach - Colton 's cache - oblivious B - tree .
A lazier solution is to take advantage of the fact that we 're dealing with bits , and not just some abstract set of totally - ordered values , and treat our keys ( addresses ) like strings of bits of constant length ( modulo leading zeros ) .
Tries are then natural ...
But they too tend to have low branching factors .
With an arbitrary length of 40 bits ( that 's 1 TB 's worth of addresses , or , rather , since I shift the 4 least significant bits out first , 16 TB ) , something like using the 20 MSB in the first level , then 10 and 10 in the second and third level seemed natural : an array of 1 million elements is n't that large , as long as there are n't thousands of them , and 1024 elements really is n't that bad either .
Moreover , restricting the trie to 3 levels reduces the number of cache misses .
Obviously , it would n't be feasible to have a dense array of 1024 or 1 M elements for each trie node , when most node will have only a few children , if any .
We need another sparse array , but this time with different goals : space efficiency and fast growth are n't such issues anymore , but read and write speeds are .
I borrowed the concept of ' critical bit ' from PATRICIA tries , and pluralized it to get a class of rather cheap hash functions that should , on typical workloads , do fine .
The idea is to identify bit positions that are identical across all keys , and form an index from the other positions by concatenating them together .
In the best case , it takes lg n bits to index from n keys ( multiples of a power of 2 ) , and , in the worst case , n bits for 2 keys ( no common bit ) .
Fortunately , we 'd expect addresses to be closer to the former than the latter .
A lookup then consists of making sure the searched key corresponds to the identical bits ( mask and compare ) , and then concatenating the variable bits together .
By looping over each byte and using look - up tables for the popcount and partial concatenating , that operation takes on the order of 30 - 100 cycle on my 2.16 GHz Core 2 .
Insertion , is , as always , a bit hairier .
The simple case is when the common bits fit ( again , mask and compare ) .
If so , all that is needed is to concatenate the new key to find its index and write in the dense array .
Otherwise , a new mask must be computed , and elements from the old dense vector reinserted in the new ( at least twice larger ) one with the correct indices .
Computing a new mask is surprisingly simple : ( logandc1 ( logxor new - value common - value ) common - mask ) .
I have n't managed to find a simpler way to do reinsertion than to recurse over the non-common bit positions to generate all the values that fit with the common bit positions ( and their values ) .
At least , that way it 's possible to compute the old concatenated index on the fly ( I have n't found how to do that for the new concatenated index yet , unfortunately ) .
It obviously pays off to add a special case when there is only one key , and store it directly , instead of using a vector of length 1 .
What was surprisingly also important to performance was to explicitly reuse the vectors that are freed on reinsertions .
By glueing these two pieces together , we get an implementation of sparse vectors that should be able to take advantage of locality in keys ( empty or nearly empty spans take very little space ) , and of ( some ) patterns in contiguous keys to save space .
It 's also reasonably performant , since it 's expected to incur very few ( a half dozen ) misses for random access .
Interestingly , it also makes predecessor / successor queries efficient , since the concatenating operation preserves ordering ( bits are concatenated in order ) .
In comparison with SBCL's hash tables ( which are n't the best in the west , but not completely horrible either ) :
Inserting all the integers in [ 0 , 2^20 ) takes 0.12s ( VS 0.83s ) , conses 8.5 MB ( VS 167 MB ) ;
Inserting 2^20 random integers in [ 0 , 2^20 ) takes 0.18s ( VS 0.81 ) conses 8.5 MB ( vs 83 MB )
Inserting all the multiples of 5 in [ 0 , 5 * 2^20 ) takes 0.40s ( VS 0.9s ) conses 42 MB ( VS 167 MB ) ;
Inserting all the multiples of 16 in [ 0 , 16* 2^20 ) takes 0.14s ( VS 0.82 s ) conses 9.6 MB ( VS 167 MB ) ;
Inserting 2^20 random multiples of 256 in [ 0 , 256*2^20 ) takes 0.72s ( VS 1.1s ) conses 25 MB ( VS 83 MB ) ;
Inserting 2^20 random multiples of 256 in [ 0 , 256*2^22 ) takes 0.86s ( VS 0.85s ) conses 49 MB ( VS 83 MB ) ;
Inserting 2^20 random integers in [ 0 , 2^30 ) takes 11s , 8.7 of which in GC , ( VS 0.69s ) conses 364 MB ( VS 83 MB ) .
For truly random keys , a hash table is better .
For my needs , however , the sparse trie is preferable : addresses usually wo n't be scattered all over the heap , so I can expect less space usage , less consing and faster execution times .
Moreover , objects close together will often be traversed together , and the sparse trie can exploit that locality , unlike hash tables .
I only compared insertions because it seems to be much slower ( often by a factor of 2 or more ) than look - ups .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A bill was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday that would overturn the Environmental Protection Agency ’s decision to prevent California from limiting the amount of greenhouse gas emissions spewed by cars .
The EPA last December turned down California ’s request for a waiver from federal law that would have permitted the state to cut vehicle carbon dioxide emissions , which when implemented would have likely have raised the required fuel efficiency of cars and also fought global warming .
A group of 60 House lawmakers introduced legislation that would immediately grant California ’s waiver request and also clear the way for 12 other states to set vehicle tailpipe emissions standards .
“ The Environmental Protection Agency ’s decision defied the science , defied the states , and defied common sense , ” said Rep. Peter Welch of Vermont , who co-sponsored the bill .
“ With consumers feeling the pinch of record fuel prices and the evidence of global warming overwhelming , the Bush administration must lead , follow , or get out of the way , ” he said .
Similar legislation was introduced in the U.S. Senate this year by Barbara Boxer of California .
The 12 states wanting to follow California in regulating tailpipe emissions are Connecticut , Maryland , Maine , Massachusetts , New Jersey , New Mexico , New York , Oregon , Pennsylvania , Rhode Island , Vermont and Washington .
The governors of Arizona , Colorado , Florida and Utah also have committed to implementing similar vehicle emissions standards .
It is his ability to bridge universes that is central to his appeal  particularly to Americans under 40 , a post - baby - boom generation that has intuited how interconnected the globe has become and thirsts for a new American lexicon , a new approach to a transformed world .
“ We first started corresponding after my dad died , ” Auma , who was born the year before her famous brother , tells me .
“ Barack ’s handwriting is exactly the same as my dad’s .
And he wrote to me on this large yellow foolscap paper that Americans use and that my dad used .
It was weird . ”
His words , linking estranged siblings , crossed universes .
Auma ’s Kenyan mother , Grace Kezia , who now lives in Britain , was pregnant with her when her father left in 1959 to study in Hawaii .
There the older Obama would meet Ann Dunham , from Wichita , Kan. , and their son , the Democratic presidential candidate , would be born in 1961 .
Auma stayed behind with an older brother .
Later , after her father ’s return to Kenya in the mid-1960s with degrees from the University of Hawaii and Harvard , Grace had two more sons with him .
Three other boys , half - brothers , were born to two other women , before the older Obama died in a Nairobi car crash .

Both of Obama ’s parents perished young : his father at 46 , his mother at 52 .
His life has been pitched forward .
No wonder , as he describes in his first book , “ Dreams From My Father , ” he quested for a past , in which lay identity .
Auma was the conduit to that .
Saltwater crocodiles have been known to attack small boats
Officials in Nhulunbuy were left with " no other option " after capturing the crocodile late in the evening , Senior Constable Wade Marshall said .
He told the BBC News website that police had placed the reptile in an unused cell in the police station .
In the morning , the male crocodile was taken to a nearby crocodile farm .
Mr Marshall said police had reacted after receiving reports that the crocodile " had a go at some fishermen retrieving their boat at the local boat ramp " .
When officials arrived at the scene the crocodile was about 30 m from the ramp .
They waited until nightfall , when the reptiles are apparently easier to spot , before capturing it .
' Looked after '
" After a couple of attempts and after three hours we managed to catch it and retrieve it , " Mr Marshall said .
" We kept it in one of the cells which is unserviceable at the moment .
" We looked after it .
It was kept on a wet blanket and hosed regularly with water . "
The crocodile 's eyes were also covered to prevent it from becoming agitated .
Mr Marshall said police in the Northern Territory town had so far been unable to speak to the fishermen threatened by the crocodile , so they had posted notices appealing for more information about the incident .
WASHINGTON —
If the truism holds that nothing is certain in politics , then the frantic run-up to the Iowa caucuses is perhaps the least certain indicator of the forces that will shape the national agenda come Jan. 20 , 2009 , Inauguration Day .
In 2000 , also a year when no incumbent president was running , these were the issues that proved successful for the two Iowa winners , Democrat Al Gore and Republican George W. Bush : Gore easily beat Bill Bradley by arguing in part that the former senator from New Jersey would jeopardize the future of Medicare .
Democrats who caucused that night said their most important issues were the meat and potatoes of the party ’s politics — Social Security , Medicare and education .
Bush won handily as the pick of those Republicans who placed moral issues at the top of their agenda , as well as those who based their choice on which Republican seemed most electable in November .
The cliché that everything has changed over the past seven years is not really a cliché .
It is a cold , hard , dangerous reality .
The world is more imperiled .
The assassination of Benazir Bhutto in Pakistan , which touched off a round of campaign bickering in both parties , has again laid bare the disastrous slide into instability in crucial regions , and the failures of American policy in Pakistan , Afghanistan and Iraq .
All have become more threatening to world security from the myopic and incompetent prosecution of the so - called global war on terror as practiced by the Bush administration .
This is why Rudy Giuliani ’s incessant recollections of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 , and his ad promoting the valor of rescue workers ( and by extension , his own ) seem as outdated as a Gore pitch about Medicare .
The deterioration of security abroad — chaotic Pakistan is a nuclear power , the new base of al - Qaida and the presumed hide - out of Osama bin Laden — makes the remembrance of 9/11 , and the Giuliani commercial ’s linkage of it to an even more distant World War II , seem jarring .
The next president ’s most immediate job will be to begin repairing the worldwide damage done to the nation ’s image and its foreign policy interests over the past seven years .
It is the only conceivable way to prevent some other mayor in some other city from having to confront what Giuliani did on 9/11 .
If Giuliani seems passé , the emergence of Mike Huckabee as a top - tier Republican contender is ludicrous .
Huckabee is the choice of many social conservatives disgruntled with a Republican field they suspect of infidelity to their core concerns .
But the former Arkansas governor ’s bizarre linkage of the Bhutto assassination with the issue of illegal immigration from across the Mexican border exposes him as ill - prepared , if not too incompetent , to hold presidency .
Among Democrats , the Barack Obama phenomenon is a replay of the Jimmy Carter experiment .
Carter emerged from obscurity to win the Iowa caucuses — and eventually the White House — in precisely the sort of political moment that Obama attempts to seize now .
The country felt a fundamental disgust at Washington after Watergate .
It looked to the fresh face of an outsider to become its healer , if not its savior .
History tells us how the Carter presidency turned out .
The former Georgia governor was incapable of dealing effectively with a Congress that was controlled by his own party , let alone the dramatic foreign threats that flared on his watch .
Carter has succeeded on a global scale as a former president — proof that experience does indeed count .
It is possible to envision only four potential presidents in the current crop of candidates .
John McCain , with his long experience in military affairs and his well - founded — if too - occasional — pique at business - as - usual , is the sole Republican who could conceivably be trusted in the job .
Bill Richardson and Joe Biden , two Democrats who have languished near the bottom of the Democratic pack , have foreign policy experience and wisdom .
Hillary Clinton , whose unprecedented travels abroad as first lady brought her face to face with the abject poverty , political oppression and historical injustices that roil so much of the world , has a legitimate claim as well .
In 2004 , John Kerry invigorated what had been a moribund campaign by asking Iowans not just to send a message but to “ send them a president . ”
Clinton ’s recent campaign slogan is that it is “ time to pick a president . ”
Kerry was right and Clinton is right .
The rest of us can only hope that Iowa listens .

Subject : Re : Does anyone know the recipe for pcp or lsd ?- urgent

Recently I read an article about making Lsd out of bakingsoda , water , cherries , egg whites , red wine , and sugar .
I promised my friend i would sell him some , but I lost the recipe .
It was in one of these newsgroups , and it got taken off .
Please reply !
> >
Can acid be made at home ?
how ?
> Yes , and it 's very simple ..
> First you will need the following ingredients :
> 2 egg whites
> 1 oz mixture ( 3 parts baking soda , 2 parts water )
> 4 fresh cherries
> a small amount of red wine ( teaspoon )
> First of all , you 'll want to get some good , expensive red wine .
The cheap stuff works , but your trips will be crappier and you 'll get some nausea .
> Ok , now that you have your stuff , put the Egg whites and cherries in a large bowl .
Start stirring until you get a pinkish mass .
Now , Pour in your mixture of baking soda .
As you do this you will notice heat building and a small amount of smoke being let off - this is normal .
Wait about 10 minutes to cool .
Then Pour in the red wine .
Immediately after you do this , steam will gather and after afew seconds you will be left with A clear liquid at the bottom of the bowl .
This is your acid .
> Happy tripping .
You 're sick , you know that !?
Really twisted !
The person who asked for the LSD recipe is probably some newbie to drug use who does n't know much about chemistry .
They 'll try the above recipe and be in for a really nasty shock .
So warning to all newbies :
The above recipe is the well known home - PCP synthesis .
Do not try it unless you 're ready for a PCP experience .
For LSD you need to use only two cherries ( not four ) and add a small amount ( level teaspoon ) of sugar prior to the wine .
If all goes well you should have some pretty mind - blowing acid on your hands ( for best results smoke some banadine during the peak ... man ; what a blast ! )
Hope this clears up some of the irresponsible misinformation spread by Fredeuss .
Ibn Battuta , the famous 14th c. world traveler , spent some time as a judge in the service of Mohammed ibn Tugluq , the fabulously wealthy Sultan of Delhi .
At the end of his description of that part of his life , he has two summary sections , one listing good things about his boss , one bad things .
One of the good things involved an incident where the Sultan slapped a young man under circumstances where he had no legal right to do so .
The young man went to law .
Mohammed ibn Tugluq made no attempt to block the legal procedings .
The court found in the plaintiff 's favor , ruling that he had the right either to monetary compensation from the Sultan or to repay slap for slap .
He took the second option , slapped the Sultan and , Ibn Battuta tells us , he himself saw the Sultan 's turban come off and fall to the ground .
Reading the account , two things are clear .
One is that Ibn Battuta believed that the Sultan acted properly , that rulers ought to be under the law just like other people .
The other is that he did not expect rulers to act that way , hence regarded doing so as particularly creditable .
Some years ago , George Bush confessed to multiple felonies committed both by himself and some of the people who work for him — interceptions of phone communications without the warrants required by FISA , the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , written to regulate just such interceptions .
Under the act , either making such an interception or knowingly using information obtained by such an interception is a felony punishable by up to five years and ten thousand dollars .
By Bush 's own account he had himself committed the latter felony and lots of people at NSA had committed the former .
For some reason , none of them have been charged .
Somewhat later , it came out that U.S. phone companies had turned over to the government massive amounts of customer information in violation of a different federal law .
A few of the customers sued .
The administration is currently attempting to get Congress to pass legislation that will immunize the phone companies from liability .
One can't expect all rulers to live up to the high standards of the 14th century Sultan of Delhi .
WASHINGTON  Screaming sports coaches and cutthroat tycoons have it wrong :
Nice guys do finish first , a new study suggests .
The Harvard University study involved 100 Boston - area college students playing the same game over and over — a punishment - heavy version of the classic one - on - one brinksmanship game of prisoner 's dilemma .
The research appears in Thursday 's edition of the journal Nature .
Common game theory has held that punishment makes two equals cooperate .
But when people compete in repeated games , punishment fails to deliver , said study author Martin Nowak .
He is director of the evolutionary dynamics lab at Harvard where the study was conducted .
" On the individual level , we find that those who use punishments are the losers , " Nowak said his experiments found .
Those who escalate the conflict very often wound up doomed .
" It 's a very positive message , " said study co-author David Rand , a Harvard biology graduate student researcher .
" In general , the thing that is most , sort of , rational and best for your own self - interest is to be nice . "
The study looked at games between equals .
Punishment does seem to have a place in games when one player is dominant and needs to enforce submission , Nowak said .
In Nowak 's experiment , the students played more than 8,000 games of prisoner 's dilemma , using dimes to reward and punish .
The normal game of prisoner 's dilemma gives two players two options : cooperate or defect .
If both cooperate , each ends up winning a dime .
If both defect , each gets nothing .
If one cooperates and the other defects , the cooperative player loses 20 cents and the defector wins 30 cents .
Nowak then added a " costly punishment " component .
A player could choose to punish someone who did n't cooperate .
That penalized the non-cooperative person 40 cents , but the other player had to pay a dime to mete out the punishment .
When Nowak compared how much money people earned or lost in the long run , there was a noticeable correlation between punishment and overall money .
The players who punished their opponents the least , or not at all , made the most money .
Those who punished the most made the least money .
When faced with a nasty opponent , turning the other cheek and continuing to cooperate — or at least not handing out punishment — paid off more in the long run , the study found .
The paper makes sense and is interesting in its look at repeated interaction , said University of Central Florida economics professor Elisabet Rutstrom , who works on game theory but was not part of the Harvard study .
Nowak said he next wants to study chief executives to see if the findings play out in the real world .

It 's Time To Wean Ourselves Off An Unhealthy Addiction To Copyright
from the distorting - the - market dept
Thank you for reading this Techdirt post .
With so many things competing for everyone ’s attention these days , we really appreciate you giving us your time .
We work hard every day to put quality content out there for our community .
Techdirt is one of the few remaining truly independent media outlets .
We do not have a giant corporation behind us , and we rely heavily on our community to support us , in an age when advertisers are increasingly uninterested in sponsoring small , independent sites — especially a site like ours that is unwilling to pull punches in its reporting and analysis .
While other websites have resorted to paywalls , registration requirements , and increasingly annoying / intrusive advertising , we have always kept Techdirt open and available to anyone .
But in order to continue doing so , we need your support .
We offer a variety of ways for our readers to support us , from direct donations to special subscriptions and cool merchandise — and every little bit helps .
Thank you .

Last week we wrote about the totally ridiculous situation where a photographer had a silly fun video taken down because she got upset that a photograph of hers was used briefly without credit or license .
As we pointed out at the time , this was an abuse of the DMCA to take down a creative work .
It was almost definitely fair use , as it's difficult to see how it would hurt the commercial value of the image .
Others who have a lot more experience in copyright law seem to agree .
The group behind the video , Richter Scales , has put up a new version of the video , without the offending photograph , and are now crediting all of the content used in the video .
You can see the new video here .
The debate over whether or not Lane Hartwell is in the right or wrong took off over the weekend and reached ridiculous levels on both sides of the aisle .
Hartwell is now demanding payment for the use of her photo , which is only going to make things worse .
She was upset the photo was in the video , and now she 's upset that it 's not in the new video .
She 's in the wrong here for a variety of reasons .
She misused the DMCA and now she 's demanding payment over what was fair use of her work .
On top of that , she 's probably convinced an awful lot of folks never to hire her -- but that 's a separate issue .
The real issue here , however , is that this is a perfect example of how our addiction to copyright does more harm than good .
Hartwell and her supporters insist that she has to do this because this is " how she makes a living . "
That 's the same claim the RIAA makes as well .
And it 's totally bogus .
For example , if I opened up a restaurant selling pizzas for $ 10 / pizza , that would be how I make my living .
Now , let 's assume that someone else sees how successful my pizza place is and decides to " copy " it and open his own pizza place down the street -- selling identical pizzas for $ 7 .
Suddenly , I go out of business because " how I make my living " is no longer sustainable .
The problem is that people assume that because they 've made their living one way -- they should always be able to do so .
When it comes to copyright , they 're relying on thethat copyright provides .
It allows them to put in place abusiness model that provides a living -- even if it's not the best business model either for the content creator or consumers .
In the pizza example , if I were a smart business person , I would learn to adjust my business model .
I 'd look for more efficient suppliers , so I could lower the cost of my pizza to match the competitor .
Or I 'd look to differentiate myself from the new competitor .
I 'd make the restaurant a nicer place to visit .
I 'd add more options to the menu .
Maybe I 'd install a big screen TV , if that 's what people wanted .
Basically --
I 'd continue to adapt my business model , making everyone benefit .
My restaurant would get better or I 'd go out of business .
Consumers would have more choice and more options that were better than before .
It 's a total win -win .
Yet , when it comes to copyright -- the crutch that copyright provides in that easy business model means that people do n't need to think about how to adapt and how to innovate .
They just scream " piracy " and complain that they 've been cheated and demand that the world change to meetneeds andbusiness model .
And copyright law often allows this to happen .
It slows down innovation and hurts the ability to create win-win situations .
Instead , we get lose - lose .
Lane Hartwell is pissed off and sending invoices that will never get paid .
The world was unable to watch this amusing video for a period of time .
That 's the opposite of everyone becoming better off and it's all because of our addiction to copyright which blinds people to the idea that there are better business models out there .
Now , some will cry about fairness and getting credit for the work that you do -- but that 's a red herring .
It 's a moral argument against an economic argument .
That does n't mean that morals do n't matter ... but the point is that if the economics shows that everyone can be better off , the moral argument fades away .
Most of these moral arguments are for preserving a world where everyone is worse off -- and that hardly seems like a good moral argument .
Others will say that I have no right to speak on this subject , because it was n't my content that was appropriated .
Again , that 's ridiculous .
Techdirt 's content gets appropriated all the time .
Sometimes blatantly in the form of spam blogs -- but as we 've explained , there 's no reason to worry about such things -- as they can only benefit you long term if you pay attention .
However , my work has also been " appropriated " by more legitimate sources as well .
There are two specific examples of this happening recently -- one involving a well known site and another involving a well known person -- both using content from this site unattributed to further their own projects .
In both cases , there is no question that the content came from here ( both admit to it privately , though the circumstances behind each are quite different ) .
In both cases , while it was personallythat these individuals chose not to credit myself or Techdirt , they only drove me to figure out better ways to present the content myself .
Even better , if more people become aware of the ideas we talk about here from other sources , the more likely they 'll be to stop by and visit this site at a later date .
It 's not about who was " first , " but about getting more folks to recognize how these things are important -- and then using that to my advantage as well .
In the short term , it may have hurt my ability to " capitalize " on these ideas -- but in the long term , it will only open up new opportunities .
Yes , I would have liked to received credit -- but why waste time on something like that , when I can put my efforts into doing more interesting things ?
What 's exciting is that these ideas are catching on and finding an audience .
Now that it 's happening , I can focus more on other topics and important things like growing the business side of Techdirt and taking those ideas even further .
If someone else is doing a better job presenting ideas that I 've been talking about , then it 's time for me to focus on something else that I can do even better -- and that 's what I 've been working on .
And , all along , Techdirt 's popularity has continued to grow .
So , even if people are first exposed to these ideas from other sources , eventually some of them will find their way here and join in the conversation as well .
They 'll add their own ideas , and something even better will come of it .
Sure , notwho sees or reads an idea that was discussed here will find out about Techdirt , but who cares ?
Those who care and those who matter will eventually figure it out if they have n't already .
So , can we please stop using copyright as a crutch and demanding " credit " for everything ?
There 's no big scorecard in the sky .
My content is built on the backs of all those who have taught and educated me -- and I 'm sure I do n't give nearly enough credit to everyone who has provided the ideas that are the core of what I do .
I " appropriate " their teachings every day of my life -- and if others appropriate mine ( even if that 's " how I earn my living " ) , it just gives me more reasons to continue to adapt and change and use that to my advantage .
It forces me to work on business models where I can take advantage of a wider distribution of this content , rather than worry about locking it down and demanding credit .
If you make your living by relying on that crutch , then start dealing with the reality that it's not a good way to make a living -- and there are many better ways that can help everyone be better off .
Despite Hartwell 's claims , she does n't really make her living from copyright .
She gets paid upfront to take pictures , and she does so because she 's good at it .
That 's a straight business transaction that has nothing to do with copyright .
She easily could have leveraged the use of the photo in the video as free advertising for her services -- and done so in a way that made everyone happy , not pissed off ( in fact , most of the other 's whose content was used in the video have responded in that manner ) .
Sure , notwould have known it was her photo , but you can't worry about everyone .
The important people figure this stuff out .
