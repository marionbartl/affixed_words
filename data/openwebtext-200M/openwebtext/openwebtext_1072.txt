Responding to what some health officials feared could be the leading edge of a global pandemic emerging from Mexico , American health officials declared a public health emergency on Sunday as 20 cases of swine flu were confirmed in this country , including eight in New York City .
Other nations imposed travel bans or made plans to quarantine air travelers as confirmed cases also appeared in Mexico and Canada and suspect cases emerged elsewhere .
Top global flu experts struggled to predict how dangerous the new A ( H1N1 ) swine flu strain would be as it became clear that they had too little information about Mexico ’s outbreak  in particular how many cases had occurred in what is thought to be a month before the outbreak was detected , and whether the virus was mutating to be more lethal , or less .
“ We ’re in a period in which the picture is evolving , ” said Dr. Keiji Fukuda , deputy director general of the World Health Organization .
“ We need to know the extent to which it causes mild and serious infections . ”

A collision involving two big-rigs and a car Wednesday caused an explosion that sent flames and clouds of smoke billowing and collapsed a highway overpass just north of Detroit , Michigan .
Fire rages at the site of a tanker crash and overpass collapse on I - 75 north of Detroit , Michigan , Wednesday .
One of the tankers was traveling on the Interstate 75 about 8:30 p.m. in Hazel Park , near the Nine - Mile overpass , when the collision caused an explosion , said Lt. Shannon Simms of the Michigan State Police .
It was headed northbound , said Bill Shreck of the Department of Transportation .
Hazel Park is about 10 miles north of downtown Detroit .
The explosion erupted upward , causing the overpass , carrying two lanes in each direction , to collapse , Simms said .

Firefighters put out the blaze late Wednesday and were able to locate all three drivers of the vehicles involved in the crash .
The three suffered minor injuries .
One of the tankers was filled with thousands of gallons of fuel , Simms said .
" I just saw a huge ball of flame go up when I was at the red light , just went up in flame , " said witness Mary Greib .
" I took off running . "

Said another witness , who did not want to be identified : " We had a woman in a light - colored , midsized vehicle of some sort that was hesitant to pass the tanker .
A number of vehicles were attempting to go around her in different directions . "
He said he was one of them , and passed her on the right , after which the explosion occurred .
" We are not sure what happened , " he said .
Vince Brennan said he was on the eighth floor of a nearby building when he heard the explosion coming from where " a vicious curve " exists on the highway .
" I heard a whole bunch of boom , boom , boom , " he said .
He ran to the window and looked down on a McDonald 's restaurant .
" You could n't even see it , it was so black with smoke , " he said .
" The flames had to be 30 , 40 feet in the air . "

Could depression serve a purpose we had n’t thought of ?
Something simple , like thinking ?
That ’s the theory presented by Paul W. Andrews and J. Anderson Thomson , Jr. in a recent article in Scientific American .
The scientists point to a couple of points of evidence to support their theory .
One , they say , ruminations help people figure out their complex problems , breaking them down into smaller , more digestible components .
Such an exercise , they argue , makes a depressed person more able to solve the problems that made them depressed in the first place :
This analytical style of thought , of course , can be very productive .
Each component is not as difficult , so the problem becomes more tractable .
Indeed , when you are faced with a difficult problem , such as a math problem , feeling depressed is often a useful response that may help you analyze and solve it .
The flip side of the coin not examined by the scientists , however , is obvious — ruminations can also be very nonproductive , too .
It ’s fine to describe how when one is an analytical frame of mind , one can tackle even highly complex problems .
But math is n’t life , and a person who suffers from depression may often ruminate with no clear answers forthcoming .
Rumination + lack of energy still = no behavior change .
But thinking about things from a different perspective is the basis of some modern psychotherapies , such as cognitive - behavioral therapy ( CBT ) .
So perhaps there ’s something to this line of thought .
Indeed , the researchers then suggest that many of the so - called symptoms of depression might just be the body ’s evolutionary way of dealing with this need to stay focused on analyzing and solving the problem that caused the depression in the first place :
Many other symptoms of depression make sense in light of the idea that analysis must be uninterrupted .
The desire for social isolation , for instance , helps the depressed person avoid situations that would require thinking about other things .
Similarly , the inability to derive pleasure from sex or other activities prevents the depressed person from engaging in activities that could distract him or her from the problem .
Even the loss of appetite often seen in depression could be viewed as promoting analysis because chewing and other oral activity interferes with the brain ’s ability to process information .
All of which is very logical and makes sense , if ruminating alone usually helped most people resolve their serious depression on their own .
But most people do n’t .
In fact , most people with depression simply suffer for years without treatment or help for it because they either feel it ’s not “ serious ” enough to seek out help , or they ’re afraid ( or too ashamed ) to get help for it .
All those people , and all that time — you ’d think we’d be seeing much higher cure rates simply by people thinking their way out of the problem .
Something unmentioned by the scientists also is worth noting — many people can’t trace their depression back to a specific concern , problem , or life event .
For many people , depression does n’t strike in some sort of logical fashion — it occurs out of the blue , for no reason at all .
All the thinking or ruminating in the world is n’t going to help someone solve a problem that does n’t exist .
For most people , ruminating about things does n’t really seem to help their depression .
So while it ’s an elegant theory on the face of it , I ’m not sure how well it stands up against the reality of most people ’s lives and the depression they face .
If depression was simply nature ’s way of saying , “ Hey , wake up and start thinking about this problem , ” I do n’t understand why most people do n’t cure themselves within a short amount of time .
After all , if nature is giving us all of these symptoms to help us think , surely it has provided us with the natural innate reasoning and analytic skills to actually solve the problem , no ?
Well , no .
It has n’t .
And that ’s the reason I do n’t think this is a theory that makes much sense to anyone who ’s ever actually dealt with depression for months or years on end .

Could Depression Be Nature ’s Way of Saying , “ Think ! ” ?

The financial fields replete with sprouting “ green shoots ” should be viewed with suspicion , if not alarm .
They are not a mirage , but they are ephemeral .
Field Marshall Ben Bernanke and his Green Shoot Brigade have fertilized the economic landscape with trillions of sweat equity dollars extorted from today ’s public and the public of generations to come .
Regardless of how depleted the land , heavy doses of dollars spread so thickly over the financial and government territories , will force “ green shoots ” to grow .
But the fundamentals of the economy remain unsound .
They will not be corrected by forced fertilizing barren acreage .
“ Green shoots " may sprout , but they will not flower .
The economy cannot be coerced back into growth with tons of money manure .
As the ancient parable puts it :
“ A sower went out to sow his seed : and as he sowed , some fell by the way side ; and it was trodden down , and the fowls of the air devoured it .
And some fell upon a rock ; and as soon as it was sprung up , it withered away , because it lacked moisture .
And some fell among thorns ; and the thorns sprang up with it , and choked it .
And other fell on good ground , and sprang up , and bare fruit an hundredfold .
And when he had said these things , he cried , He that hath ears to hear , let him hear . ” — Luke 8:48
Now hear this : it is inconceivable that the “ green shoots ” are signs of sustained economic recovery .
No one could have forecast that the government would not only intervene in the markets by pouring unprecedented trillions into bailout schemes , but that they would commandeer the whole free enterprise system .
The 800 - pound gorilla has ridden the elephant into the Oval Office , and they are there for all to see .
But few will call a spade a spade .
Benito Mussolini described Fascism as " The merger of state and corporate power . "
He suggested that , more appropriately , it should be called " Corporatism . "
By whatever name , Corporatism or Fascism , what it ’s not is Free Market Capitalism , much less Democracy .
“ Green shoots ” can only be brought to harvest through real productivity .
Pumping gigantic sums of money into too - big - to - fail financial institutions to jump - start the lending / borrowing cycle is to perpetuate a failed economic model .
( See “ The Greatest Depression . " )
We can extrapolate creatively from data , but cannot prophesize wild cards , such as acts of God , acts of nature , or acts of man that can only be described as " schemes undreamed of . "
While there have been warnings since the founding of the United States , no one , but no one , could have predicted the mega- merger of Wall Street and Washington that is now a fait accompli .
With so much money being dumped into the system , there will be money to be made … and lost .
The agile and the knowledgeable may be able to reap “ green shoots ” while they ’re sprouted .
But beware !
“ The Greatest Depression ” — that we forecast would begin to set in by the end of this year — may have been postponed , but it has not been averted .
When it does set in , it will do so with enhanced intensity and at a pace accelerated by complex financial finagling … all under the guise of nation - saving action .
Rather than let the failing industries fail and the failed banks go bankrupt , the government is deliberately bankrupting the nation .
The lesson to be learned from the financial crisis that began in the summer of 2007 , is that nothing succeeds like failure .
The greater their failure , the bolder they become .
The more they lose , the more they take .
The greater the chaos , the more control they exact .
The bigger they fail , the harder we fall .
No act is too unthinkable or measure too draconian for the Washington Wall Street Mob to concoct in order to maintain power , make money and cover their losses .
While it is impossible to second - guess what the government will do next , it is absolutely certain that they will stop at nothing .
The “ green shoots ” will wither and conditions will deteriorate .
Those who are prepared for the worst will not have been taken by surprise .

The Best of Gerald Celente
The former treasurer was full of arch , Cheshire Cat - like non sequiturs and half - cloaked accusations that faded immediately to leave only the unmistakable outline of the famous Costello smirk .
" If I 'd wanted to be a threat to Malcolm Turnbull 's leadership , I could have put up my hand on any one of , you know , 100 days and nominated for the leadership , " he said at one point , amid ceaseless book plugs ( the phrase " as I write in the book " , or variations thereof , was used eight times ) .
" The fact that I did n't meant that he was entirely secure .
If I 'd wanted to , I could have . "
This is a brilliant , Wonderland - style explanation of the situation that existed within the Liberal Party from the very moment Turnbull took over as Liberal leader .
Costello could have crushed Turnbull at any time , but chose not to ; in Costello 's eyes , this earns him further credit within the party , to add to the brownie points he generously awards himself for more than a decade of not challenging John Howard .
This year must have been quite a satisfying period for Costello , allowing him as it did to return to the field of cat - and - mouse leadership strategy , this time - for the first time in 12 years - playing the role of the cat .
But you could equally understand why Turnbull did n't share his enthusiasm .
For Turnbull , one of the most psychologically crippling aspects of Costello 's political dance of the seven thousand veils this year has been that he simply cannot understand an adversary who behaves like that .
One who fades in and out of the picture , delivering a wink here , and a quizzical grin there , unwilling to throw a punch but never quite returning to the dressing rooms .
There is nothing in Turnbull 's past to suggest that he has any idea how to tackle the passive - aggressive approach that is Costello 's hallmark .
Turnbull is aggressive - aggressive , and that 's that , and the nebulous threat of Costello drove him to distraction , because it disabled all three of Turnbull 's customary responses to threat : Crush It , Buy It or Sue It .
I mention all this mainly because it 's useful in understanding what was going on that week when Parliament turned into Wonderland .
We all started in on this weird and wondrous chase after the elusive , lippety - loppity form of Godwin Grech , who now is blessedly - if temporarily - safe in the arms of Canberra 's mental health professionals .
Incidentally , it is now reported that Senator Steve Fielding is trying to get in touch with Grech , to seek his counsel over the structure of a possible Senate privileges inquiry into the whole affair .
Poor Grech .
He already has some pretty serious problems - from depression and job security issues to the regular small bowel obstructions which were rather too plentifully mentioned in this week 's audit report to make that document anything like advisable breakfast reading .
To a man such as Grech already so benighted by circumstance , overtures of friendship from Fielding might seem like the latest of fate 's cruel blows .
Still , he started it , I guess .
Back to Turnbull , and the mind games of the Cheshire Cat .
It 's entirely relevant that the Grech affair came to a head in the same week that Costello finally climbed out of the ring and headed for the showers .
The effect on Turnbull was immediate , and visible .
He was like a man who had had a large Bulldog clip removed from his brain .
He could not keep from smiling , even in Parliament as he delivered the obligatory lament about the loss of such a talented Coalition asset .
Imagine how bulletproof Turnbull must have felt .
His enemies , falling before him unsmitten !
The promise of a prime ministerial scalp hovering - unseen by all except Turnbull himself - just around the next bend !
All of a sudden , he was once more the Turnbull of old , before whom in happier times
Fate itself seemed to doff its cap .
Costello made his announcement on the Monday of that week .
It 's no wonder that , in such a mood , Turnbull took it upon himself on that Wednesday night to deliver a fatherly word of advice to the Rudd staffer Andrew Charlton , in whose precocious intelligence Turnbull would doubtless recognise an echo of himself at 30 .
And no wonder at all that Turnbull , having thus thoroughly tipped off the PM 's office , would then overplay in lordly fashion his accusations against Rudd and Swan on the Friday .
One cannot blame the Cheshire Cat directly for all this , of course .
One simply notes the imprimatur of his grin .
Costello was quick to point out this week that he would have been more cautious than Turnbull in transacting the OzCar affair , and that he would never have allowed the film crew from Australian Story into his office , as Turnbull did , to capture the inner workings of the debacle for posterity .
He is free to make these remarks .
The net effect of his own decisions is that he will never have to prove empirically that he would be less hopeless as Liberal leader than any of the poor boobs who have actually had a shot at it .
Just what would it take , at this stage , for Costello to quell the talk among Coalition fantasists about his triumphal return ?
That 's a very tough question .
Even if Costello arranged to be run over by a bus on Commonwealth Avenue , than have his body burnt on a funeral pyre of old budget papers out the front of Parliament House , there 's nothing surer than that within days senior party sources would be quoted around the place with cautious messages of hope .
Loading " Sure , on the face of it you have to take him at his word , " you can almost hear them saying .
" But as anyone who saw the 1990 Jerry Zucker film Ghost knows , there is absolutely nothing that would prevent Peter Costello 's spirit from returning to Earth and leading the Liberal Party with the help of a wisecracking psychic played by Whoopi Goldberg . "
I would n't rule out the whole staged - death thing , by the way - there 's bound to be a further update to the memoirs at some point and Costello will need another gimmick for that , so save your old budgets , folks , just in case .
Late one night , a beautiful and well - dressed young woman , Grace ( Nicole Kidman ) , arrives in the mountainous old mining town of Dogville as a fugitive ; following the sound of gunshots in the distance which have been heard by Tom ( Paul Bettany ) , the self - appointed moral spokesman for the town .
Persuaded by Tom , the town agree to hide Grace , and in return she freely helps the locals .
However , when the Sheriff from a neighbouring town posts a Missing notice , advertising a reward for revealing her whereabouts , the townsfolk require a better deal from Grace , in return for their silence ; and when the Sheriff returns some weeks later with a Wanted poster , even though the citizens know her to be innocent of the false charges against her , the town 's sense of goodness takes a sinister turn and the price of Grace 's freedom becomes a workload and treatment akin to that of a slave .
But Grace has a deadly secret that the townsfolk will eventually encounter .

When it comes to health care costs , the United States is far and away No. 1 in the world .
Left as it is , our system will destroy the nation ’s fiscal as well as physical well - being — and nowhere is that more obvious than in the Golden State .
Skyrocketing health care costs are a major contributor to California ’s budget disaster .
If the governor ’s proposed cuts are accepted , 2 million more Californians will join the ranks of the uninsured , bringing the total to about 8.5 million , or more than 20 percent of the population .
The damage to the economy will be felt in many ways , not the least of which is the soaring cost to the public of emergency room visits , the only care left to families who ca n’t otherwise see a doctor .
California cannot afford to have President Barack Obama ’s comprehensive reform initiative go down in defeat this year .
Obama will take his case directly to the American Medical Association on Monday as part of a major national push for reforms .
The president no doubt will mention that the U.S. spent $ 2.4 trillion last year on health care , far more per capita than other industrialized nations , which also manage to provide health insurance to all their citizens .
Obama says he ’s flexible on the final outline of a plan , but he continues to favor a government - backed insurance option that would provide competition for private insurers .
The AMA announced its opposition to a public option last week .
But given the amount of money now lost to middlemen in private plans , the president is persuasive .
It seems counterintuitive that the government would be capable of outperforming private industry in the world of health care .
But Medicare has lower costs , far lower overhead and higher consumer satisfaction than private insurers .
The contrast is most obvious in overhead — basically paperwork and salaries of middlemen and executives .
Private insurers consume 30 percent of health care dollars on overhead .
Medicare uses just 3 percent .
The AMA and others fear that the public option would eventually drive private insurers out of business , leaving government with no competition .
But that wo n’t happen if private companies become more efficient .
The current margins are ridiculous .
Besides , Medicare has its own weaknesses , including an ineffective fee system that underpays hospitals and doctors for services and ends up rewarding volume more than quality of care .
Providing universal coverage will deal with the health care crisis on a personal level , but from the standpoint of the national economy , cutting costs is even more important .
A brilliant article by Atul Gawande in the June 1 New Yorker makes the challenge clear by looking at one community with high health care costs .
Gawande argues that the U.S. system must focus first on effectiveness of treatments , while “ discouraging overtreatment , undertreatment and sheer profiteering . ”
If we can accomplish that goal , Americans wo n’t care whether the system is public , private or , most likely , a combination .
But it ’s hard to see how to get the cost savings without some competitive pressure .

Tropical Comeback Can New Growth Save the Amazon Rainforest ?
Is the Amazon rainforest recovering ?
New studies suggest that the long - term consequences of deforestation may not be as bad as predicted , as vegetation makes a comeback on abandoned agricultural land .
OpEd News has published an open letter from attorney Dana Jill Simpson ( 8/20/09 ) to “ Mr. Murdoch and all the editors at the Wall Street Journal , ” in which she expresses her wish to “ thank you from the very bottom of my heart for running Karl Rove ’s delusional article , ‘ Closing In on Rove , ’ on August 20 , 2009 ″ :
The reason I want to thank you is that Mr. Rove has clearly lied about me in this article .
You have captured and printed it without even checking to see if it is so or not .
The lie he has told is and I quote , “ Judiciary Democrats did n’t get testimony from either Mr. Siegelman or Dana Jill Simpson , the eccentric Alabama lawyer , who drew attention by publicly supporting the allegations . ”
In case you are unaware , I testified on September 14 , 2007 , before the House Judiciary Committee lawyers that were selected to question me .
I most definitely gave sworn testimony to the House Judiciary Democrats .
In fact , I gave over 143 pages of testimony before the Judiciary Democratic and Republican lawyers .
It is unfortunate that your paper does not give a rip about the truth or you would have checked out the bold - faced lie that Karl Rove put in his article before you printed it .
The OpEd News mini-bio of Simpson notes that she “ has appeared on 60 Minutes and Dan Abrams MSNBC , ” and that “ stories were written in Time magazine , Harper ’s magazine , and the New York Times about her being a witness in the Don Siegelman case on corruption at the Justice Department . ”
Still , in closing , Simpson tells the Journal she ’s actually “ happy today to call Mr. Rove a liar and you have provided the cold hard proof .
You , Mr. Murdoch , gave me that opportunity .
I am thankful that you run a paper that apparently does not check for the truth . ”
Investment markets got you down , Bunkie ?
Been blown away by derivative stun guns ?
When will portfolio market values move back to 2007 levels — and then what will you do about it ?
It ’s time to overthrow the evil Masters of the Universe and deactivate their weapons of financial destruction .
Let ’s outlaw the brainwashing that has changed how average investors look at and value their investment portfolios .
It ’s time to exorcize the Wall Street demons and return to stocks and bonds — and to QDI , “ the Force ” for long - term investment portfolio security .
Speculating is complicated , even for financial rocket scientists .
What most of us want ( or would certainly settle for ) is simplicity , stability , and reasonable growth in our productive working capital .
A return to plain vanilla investing strategies with operating procedures that minimize risk and encourage understanding of the financial markets needs to become part of our financial force field .
As bad as things have been since this black hole appeared , investment models true to fundamental concepts , simple strategies , and disciplined operating rules have probably bettered the market numbers in at least six important ways :
Read
One – Higher lows during market downturns : Equity portfolios managed using basic principles of quality , diversification , and income ( the QDI ) and disciplined profit taking rules should not fall as much in market value as most mutual funds or poorly diversified portfolios .
Constant cash flow , even if not reinvested , places a floor under market values , and investors feel better when their values fall less than the market averages .
In soundly managed programs , buying activity slows as prices rise — increasing “ smart cash ” for buying at lower levels later .
Two – Moves to cash or other sectors before bubbles burst : Disciplined profit taking automatically moves dollars from overheated sectors to cash or undervalued sectors during rising markets .
This process creates capital that can be used to lower the average cost of remaining positions or to take advantage of new opportunities .
Investors feel better when no profits have been left on the table .
Three – Maintenance of planned income streams during financial crises :
Most financial plans focus so strongly on growing market values that they lose touch with the need for planning a dependable retirement income .
They rely on selling equity fund units or inflated indices for cash flow , instead of generating stable income with less exciting cash producing staples .
Steadily increasing annual income can be placed on “ cruise control ” through the use of the cost basis asset allocation methods contained in the WCM ( Working Capital Model ) .
How many would - be retirees are searching for jobs because of improper income planning ?
Four – Faster movement to new all time market value highs :
When investors have a reasonable understanding of the various cycles impacting their investment portfolios , they develop valid expectations about the market value “ performance ” of their portfolios .
They are less likely to initiate knee - jerk or panic driven transactions and more likely to take advantage of the new opportunities that lower security prices always create .
Additionally , higher quality securities invariably are in the first group to regain popularity with investors as good news reports begin to dominate .
Five – Steady growth in working capital in all market environments :
Working capital is measured in terms of cost basis instead of market price .
As a result , all income generated from interest , dividends , and realized gains grow working capital regardless of the direction of market prices .
A treasury bond generates the same income at $ 85 as at $ 115 .
Most closed - end municipal bond funds ( CEFs ) maintained their 5 % to 7 % tax - free cash flow throughout the financial crisis — in spite of their reduced market values .
Similarly , short - term profits on high quality securities have been growing working capital since the current rally took hold in March .
Six – Annual growth in realized “ base income ” in standard portfolios : WCM portfolios are income machines by design .
No security is ever purchased if it does not produce regular dividend or interest payments ; at least 30 % of all base income should be reallocated to income - objective securities .
Similarly , every dollar of capital gains income , and net portfolio additions are partially allocated to income producers — and the use of a cost based asset allocation formula insures annual income growth .
Few financial professionals begin their careers with any encouragement to become comfortable with individual equity securities and the surprisingly large variety of individual , relatively uncomplicated , and generally safe ( r ) income producers available for their clients .
Financial products are far more lucrative for their institutional employers and , as a result , the incentives for brokers and advisors to sell products is pretty much irresistible .
Few pros can afford to be one with “ The Force ” .
The Dark Side of investing beckons like a Siren ’s song , luring the majority of professional advisors away from the safety and simplicity of QDI .
Institutional propaganda , projections , predictions , and hype have the same affect on unsuspecting boatloads of speculators who most often become shipwrecked on the derivative rocks .
Investors and their professionals need to re-evaluate their product orientation and plot a global escape from the Dark Side of investing .
Contact the “ Skywalker ” foundation for emotional and financial support while making the transition — and may the force be with you .

In the markets of Kilju , a city of 100,000 near North Korea ’s eastern seacoast , the ruling Korean Workers ’ Party has ordered the removal of Chinese - made cookies , candies and pharmaceuticals .
Even soybeans , many articles of clothing and shoes are now forbidden .
It is all part of a great leap backward taking place in the secretive autocracy .
North Koreans interviewed in China in recent weeks say that the regime of Kim Jong
Il has made a concerted effort to roll back reforms that had over the last decade liberalized the most strictly controlled economy in the world .
“ They ’re telling us that we do n’t need markets and that socialism provides everything we need , ” said an unemployed factory worker in her 50s , who gave her name as Lee Myong Hee .
( North Koreans outside their country often give fake names because speaking to foreigners can be considered treason under North Korean law . )

Lee sneaked across the border last month into China , hoping she could make some money for her family .
Thin and nervous , her body sculpted by a diet of two bowls of porridge each day , she said the party ’s unbending ideology has squeezed the life out of the city ’s economy .
“ If they do n’t give us food and clothing and we ’re not allowed to buy things , how can we survive ? ”
Lee said , tears rolling down hollowed cheeks .
The Korean Workers ’ Party has banned the sale and swapping of apartments , practices that were widespread for more than a decade .
The open - air markets where people do most of their buying and selling are now open only from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m .
The only people permitted to sell at the markets are women older than 50 ; everybody else is required to spend their days at their official jobs at government - run businesses .
So many Chinese goods are now taboo that markets stock only about 35 % of the merchandise previously available , some say .

“ They want to promote our own products made in North Korea , but since everything is ‘ made in China , ’ there is nothing to buy , ” said Kim Young Chul , a civilian working for the North Korean military who had come to China to sell wild ginseng on behalf of his employer .
The economic restrictions reflect the rising power of the hard - liners within the staunchly communist regime and go hand in hand with the belligerent mood that led to North Korea ’s May 25 nuclear test .
Those jostling for power in the scramble created by the failing health of 68 - year - old North Korean leader Kim Jong
Il are raising the banner of juche , the term coined by his father , Kim Il Sung , the country ’s founder , for an ideology emphasizing self - sufficiency .
North Korea has in effect scuttled dialogue with the United States , South Korea and Japan , shut down South Korean business interests within its borders and evicted many humanitarian aid operations .
“ The North Koreans want to close off their country so they will not be hurt by sanctions .
They think everybody is out to ruin their country and they are getting rid of anything that could be a threat , ” said Cho Myong - chol , a former economics professor at Pyongyang ’s Kim Il Sung University who defected to South Korea in 1994 .

Kilju is an agricultural and industrial city in North Hamgyong province , known to the outside world for its proximity to North Korea ’s Musudan - ri missile base and to the underground site of the May nuclear test , about 30 miles to the northwest .
Like other remote North Korean cities , it was decimated by famine in the mid-1990s when the public distribution system for food broke down .
As a consequence , the government was forced to loosen its grip on the economy .
Farmers markets that had been permitted to sell homegrown vegetables , usually laid out on tarpaulins on the ground , gradually expanded .
Traders ( many crossing the border illegally ) started importing Chinese goods , including children ’s sneakers , bananas and DVD players .
North Koreans brightened up their famously drab landscape a bit by wearing pinks , polka dots and paisleys , occasionally sporting T - shirts with English writing .
In 2002 , the North Korean regime belatedly legalized the markets and in many cities built stalls and enclosures to rent out to vendors .

The dismal state - owned stores closed their doors and mysterious North Korea began to look a little more like other countries .
But then , the pendulum started to swing backward .
In ideological sessions compulsory for all North Koreans , the Workers ’ Party railed against markets as “ hotbeds of anti-socialism . ”
In recent months , the North Korean government has become as strict about what is exported as what comes in .
The sale of soybeans -- a staple in the North Korean diet -- has been banned , with the explanation that they might be taken out of the country for re-sale in China .
“ They tell us the army needs the soybeans and that our soldiers wo n’t be strong enough to lift their guns , ” said Lee , the unemployed factory worker .

Kim Chol
Hee , a trader from Yanji , a Chinese city near the border with a large ethnic Korean population , said it was harder now than at any time in the 10 years he ’s been in business to import from North Korea .
“ I used to bring in squid , crab , steel parts from Chongjin .
We can still buy seafood , but the North Korean government wo n’t let us buy steel , ” he said Kim .
“ They say they need to keep all their resources for themselves . ”
Along the Tumen River , which runs along the border and which traders and defectors used to cross freely , North Korean guards are now posted every 10 yards instead of every 100 yards as they were a few years ago , residents say .
The crackdown has mainly targeted North Hamgyong province , which has had the most vibrant markets in the country because of its proximity to the Chinese border and its distance from Pyongyang , the capital .

Edicts from Pyongyang often have been met with resistance .
In the province ’s main city , Chongjin , vendors held a rare public protest in March 2008 outside the main Sunnam market after officials tried to ban younger women from trading , according to Good Friends , a Seoul - based Buddhist charity .
“ Give us food or let us trade , ” hundreds of woman reportedly chanted .
The protests forced Chongjin officials to reverse the order .
But this year , Pyongyang has become more insistent .
“ The controls are very strict right now , ” said Lee .
“ If they find clothing with a South Korean label , the police will take it away .
They ’ll confiscate Chinese clothing too unless it ’s old and ugly . ”

“ They tell us we ca n’t use Chinese makeup because it will give you blisters .
. . .
Chinese cookies will make you sick , they tell us . ”
Kilju residents have not dared to hold public protests against the restriction .
But the Korean Workers Party nonetheless might be fighting a losing battle .
Much of the trading is done by people with powerful connections in the provincial government and the military .
Many state - owned enterprises do illegal trading to raise cash for their operations .
For example , trader Kim Young Chul says he is responsible for raising about $ 900 each year for his work unit by selling ginseng , while he and his partners keep any additional profits .
“ I have a lot of freedom .
They do n’t dare ask me too many questions in North Korea , because I work for the ministry , ” said Kim .

Just as quickly as the Korean Workers ’
Party issues a decree , people find a way to circumvent it .
Vendors banned from the market bring out their mothers and grandmothers , while secretly running the businesses from behind the scenes .
Others sell banned good from their homes , or simply stash it behind other merchandise .
“ If you want to buy cosmetics in Kilju , you still can find them , but they are usually hidden underneath the table , ” Lee said .
Once a loyal member of the Workers ’ Party , Lee said she had remained devoted to Kim Jong
Il up to her departure from North Korea in May , vowing that she would return home as soon as she got money for her family .
“ Even the day I left , I was singing songs about Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong
Il in my house , ” said Lee .
“ Now that I ’ve come to China , I ’m not so sure .

“ I begin to think is n’t it a waste to be spending money on a nuclear weapon when people are starving . ”

In its continuing effort to reduce graffiti , the Los Angeles City Council is considering expanding restrictions on the sale of aerosol spraypaint cans and other materials to people under 21 .
At the request of Councilmen Dennis Zine , Greig Smith and Eric Garcetti , the public safety committee today asked city lawyers to work on a possible ordinance that would outlaw sales to anyone under 21 , after seeking recommendations from the Los Angeles Police Department and the city ’s legislative analysts .
“ We need to make it as tough as possible if we ’re going to get serious on the eradication of graffiti in the city of Los Angeles .
Otherwise it ’s cosmetic , it does no good and people continually look at us to say ‘ What are you doing to fix this problem that is terrorizing neighborhoods ? ’ ” Zine said Monday during the public safety committee meeting .
Lawyers said there is already a state law prohibiting the sale of spraypaint cans and etching cream to those under 18 .
Zine said he hoped the council would raise that age limit to 21 , and consider other options such as requiring spraypaint purchasers to show identification or making it a crime for a minor to carry spray paint .
The city already requires retailers to keep the paint cans in a locked container .
“ As we can see by driving down any freeway , " Zine said , " the current laws are n’t working .
They are absolutely being ignored and the consequences are n’t severe enough to have an impact . ”

The events that transpire in the game connect a 1950 ’s Russian disaster , to the year 2010 .
Think of this disaster as comparable to Chernobyl , the backdrop is a new Russian politician has entered the scene and the US is interested in investigating this long hidden mystery .
While FPS ‘ featuring time manipulation are nothing new , Singularity takes things in a bit different direction .
This title takes time mechanics in a new direction .
Time is controlled via the TMD , Time Manipulation Device .
The device can control anything that contains element E99 .
Which allows you to damage , destroy enemies , reconstruct buildings and control E99 bullets .
The story progresses through several different time events .
Echoes are flashbacks and allow you to see events that took place in the 1950s .
These help you to piece the story together and unravel the conspiracy .
The null zone can change the entire environment by changing it to its 1950s ’ form .
As the game progresses , null zone items will be available for use in combat and to progress through the game .
Singularity was recently delayed until 2010 .
A NEW home - testing kit that detects drug use through hair samples has been branded an invasion of privacy by civil liberties and health groups .
One spokesman said the tests would ruin trust between parents and their children .
HairConfirm , produced by American biotech company Confirm BioSciences and launched in Australia this month , is marketed to those concerned their children are using drugs .
Parents who buy the $ 65 kit can collect a lock of their child 's hair and send it to the US to be analysed for drugs including marijuana , cocaine , heroin , ecstasy , amphetamine and methamphetamine .
The results , claimed to be 99.9 per cent accurate , are available online within 48 hours .
Peter Menedis - a consultant to the kit 's international distributor , Instant Drug Testing - said people had a right to know if their child was using drugs .
'' The parent is responsible for the child .
No parent wants to see their child descend into addiction .
Every parent wants to be the best parent they can be and they want to do what 's best for their children . ''
This report was written by a witness to events in Tehran this weekend .
CNN is not identifying this witness and others who have filed accounts or photos of the protests and violence in Iran and requested anonymity for fear of reprisals .
An eyewitness says the hatred is palpable on both sides in the streets of Tehran .

TEHRAN , Iran ( CNN ) --
He was surrounded and pleading for them to stop but six men with clubs , batons and metal rods kept battering a young Iranian man with ruthless force .
The swing that keeps replaying in my head was the black baton that smashed the man in the skull behind his left ear .
Seconds earlier the man had dared to stand up to the baton wielding men because they had shoved a 14 - year - old girl .
For his chivalry he got one of the most savage beatings I have ever seen at the hands of four Iranian riot policemen and members of the Baseej , Iran 's plain clothed volunteer militia .
" To hell with Iran , " he said as he sat beaten and battered along the sidewalk .
" This is not my government .
This is not my country . "
A grown man who watched the beating burst into tears .
This was a glimpse of the ugly aftermath of Iran 's presidential elections , which sparked outrage among supporters of candidate Mir Hossein Moussavi .
Moussavi's backers are calling President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's landslide victory a sham .
They 're demanding the vote be annulled .
The government 's response has been a ruthless and violent crackdown .
For eight chaotic hours I saw the two sides clash throughout the streets of Tehran .
These were Iranians versus Iranians , but the two sides were worlds apart in appearance , ideology and brute force .
Moussavi 's supporters were mostly young 20 - something men and women .
They were college students , young professionals with degrees demanding social freedom , a better way of life , and better relations with the West .
Two teenage girls carrying bricks had French manicured fingernails and designer sunglasses .
The protesters threw objects , burned trash bins , honked their horns and chanted " death to the dictator ! "
They were loud , until they heard the roar of the motorcycles .
The motorcycles belonged to two groups of Ahmadinejad supporters : Iran 's riot police and the Baseej .
The riot police looked like modern gladiators , muscular and menacing with camouflaged uniforms , black boots , black bulletproof vests and black shielded helmets .
They rode in pairs .
One drove while the other wielded a club or a baton .
They swarmed crowds of rowdy protesters in packs of about 20 , beating anyone who got in their way .
On several occasions I saw female Moussavi supporters plead with their male counterparts not to run away .
But they almost always did .
They were clearly intimidated by the brutal show of force .
The Baseejis were just as ruthless .
Those who did n't ride on motorcycles walked the streets in large packs carrying clubs .
They did n't wear uniforms , so they could easily ambush protesters .
They beat one protester so badly that he collapsed in the middle of an intersection and trembled uncontrollably .
I saw one battered young man crawl into the lobby of an apartment building , curl up under the stairwell and sob .
He had welts on his forehead and bruises up and down his arms .
" They hit me with everything , " he said as he gasped for air .
" They hit with clubs .
They hit me with chains . "
When the two sides were n't throwing objects at one another , they were hurling insults .
I heard and felt the hatred on both sides .
During a Saturday afternoon news conference Ahmadinejad compared the violent crackdown against the protesters to a citation after a traffic ticket .
A few hours later thousands gathered in midtown Tehran to hear Ahmadinejad deliver a victory speech .
The re-elected president said the elections belonged to Iran 's people .
Never since the Islamic Revolution of 1979 have Iran 's people appeared this divided .

Chinese officials are investigating the case of a teenager who was allegedly beaten to death at a camp designed to treat internet addiction .
Fifteen - year - old Deng Senshan died on Sunday less than 24 hours after arrival at the Qihang Salvation Training Camp .
Four members of staff at the facility in Nanning have been arrested over the death , according to local reports .
China is increasingly taking action to treat what it sees as a pandemic of web addiction amongst teenagers .
Some estimates suggest up to 10 % of the country 's 100 million web users under 20 could be addicted , and a growing number of rehabilitation services exist .
However , there is little consensus on how to treat the addiction .
Tao Ran , director of the country 's first internet addiction treatment clinic in Beijing , told The Associated Press ( AP ) that most camps chose to use military - style discipline over scientific methods .
He said this was a particular problem for many of the children because they suffered from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder .
" Once you put these kids to the training camps or schools , they are bound to have problems with the teachers , because ... they can't be still , while the training is all about keeping still , " he told AP .
In July , China 's Ministry of Health formally banned the use of electroshock therapy as a treatment option .
Deng 's father told the Xinhua news agency that his son spent all his time on the internet and had decided to send his son to the camp in southern Guangxi province after seeing an advertisement on television .
According to the China Daily newspaper , an agreement the teenagers ' parents signed with the camp said : " The centre can take necessary approaches including punishment to educate the teenager , as long as the approaches will not abuse the child or impair his health . "
Camp staff are alleged to have put the teenager in solitary confinement on Saturday and then beaten him that evening .
Xinhua reported that Deng was found vomiting and was taken to a clinic where he died .
The report also said that local government officials had found several marks on his body .

With sci- fi reboots all the rage , ABC is updating the 1984 miniseries V about an alien invasion of Earth .
In the show , which debuts Nov. 3 , Lost star Elizabeth Mitchell will play an FBI agent trying to figure out what weird mysteries lie beneath the skin of the " Visitors , " aliens that have thrown earthlings for a loop by promising peace , love and understanding of advanced technologies .
" I really fell in love with this character , " said Mitchell at a Saturday press conference in Hollywood .
" I like playing a traditional hero . "
V producer Jeffrey Bell said the new show will pay homage to the original series with references to the Visitors ' rat-eating diet .
He also hopes to hook viewers with a multi-season story arc and detail - rich fan bait reminiscent of television 's recent sci- fi successes .
" On Lost or Battlestar or any other awesome shows out there , " Bell said , " people are live - blogging and die - hard fans are freezing frames and TiVo-ing and finding Easter eggs to see what happened .
It 's our job to build that into V for those people but to also keep the story simple .
It 's a show about spaceships . "
It 's a calculated move at a time when sci - fi reboots have a mixed track record on television .
The recently completed Battlestar Galactica won fan and critical accolades for its gritty update of the cheesy ' 70s series , while even rabid fans could n't save Terminator : The Sarah Connor Chronicles .
ABC 's updated V will debut the same month that AMC rolls out its 21st - century remake of ' 60s spy - fi show The Prisoner .
The new version of V ( trailer embedded above ) expands on the original show 's propaganda theme as market - savvy aliens take brainwashing to a new level .
" Propaganda has just become advertising " in modern society , Bell said .
" Everything is branded , everything is turned into a product , so the Visitors are going to do that .
The Vs are going to brand themselves .
The Vs are going to advertise and promote , and we are all going to want to , like , love the Vs . "
Mitchell , the Lost star who said she watched the original V when she was a kid , referred to her recent appearance on the " Wonder Women : Female Power Icons in Pop Culture " panel at Comic - Con International in San Diego last month when talking about the alien - fighting FBI agent she plays in V .
Morena Baccarin , left , plays alien leader Anna in V .

" I did a panel with Sigourney Weaver and she said she always chooses male roles because she felt like they are meatier , " Mitchell said .
" In the previous version of V , I believe my character was a man , so I 'm excited and hoping to step up to it . "
V also features Morena Baccarin ( Serenity ) as Anna , leader of the Visitors , along with Scott Wolf , Morris Chestnut , Logan Huffman , Joel Gretsch and Laura Vandervoort .
Will Mitchell fall victim to the Visitors ' charms ?
First she has to finish her gig on Lost .
When last seen , her character Juliet Burke was presumably getting blown to bits during the Season 5 finale .
" I am going to be traveling to Hawaii more than once , " Mitchell said .
" We 'll see how that plays out .
I will actually be back on Lost .
I can't say whether I 'm dead or not , but as in all things in Lost , it will be fairly tricky . "
V debuts Nov. 3 at 8 p.m. EST on ABC .

Sun 's OpenSolaris platform aims to supply a user - friendly desktop distribution of the open source Solaris operating system .
The third major OpenSolaris release , version 2009.06 , was made available last week .
It introduces support for SPARC hardware and also brings improved Windows interoperability and advanced virtualization capabilities .
Along with 2009.06 , Sun is also announcing the first - ever release of the OpenSolaris ARM port , which could bring the operating system to mobile devices .
Sun first began a serious community - building effort around OpenSolaris with the emergence of the Project Indiana initiative in 2007 .
Indiana was established to help grow OpenSolaris mindshare and make the underlying technology more accessible to regular end users and developers .
During the early development stages a very strong emphasis was placed on ease of installation and delivering a strong package management experience .
Sun recruited Debian founder Ian Murdock to get the job done .
We reviewed the first official release in 2008 and found an impressively solid out - of - the - box experience with a high - quality installer that rivals Ubuntu for ease of use .
There were a lot of pieces missing , however , particularly hardware compatibility and graphical configuration tools .
The second release , 2008.11 , addressed the most significant early problems and brought some really impressive features like the ZFS time slider .
Our biggest complaint with the 2008.11 release was the lack of prepackaged software .
Software availability has improved modestly according to the numbers provided by the package management tool .
The 2008.11 release offered 1,500 packages and the new version bumps it up to 1,700 .
This an improvement , but it 's still dwarfed by Ubuntu 's 26,000 packages .
In practice , the repository has got most of what you will need to do software development , especially if you are working within the boundaries of Sun 's ecosystem .
As we noted in our 2008.11 review , you can get a project up and running with NetBeans in a matter of minutes after you install OpenSolaris .
The most glaring omission from the 2008.11 repository was GVim , which I 'm pleased to report is now included .
One of the most significant improvements in the new version of OpenSolaris is the introduction of Project Crossbow , a powerful framework for network virtualization and resource control .
It lets you compartmentalize Web services in separate virtualized network stacks , making it possible to get extremely fine - grained control over the network resources allocated to individual Web services .
Sun suggests that this technology is extremely effective for configuring specialized QoS behaviors and ensuring that high load on one service wo n't impact others running on an individual box .
Multimedia also got a boost in this release with the addition of Codeina , a tool for obtaining GStreamer codecs .
It provides users with the ability to legally obtain patent - encumbered codecs by buying licensed copies from Fluendo .
The time slider , which is probably my favorite OpenSolaris feature , got several enhancements in 2009.06 .
The new version has a button for manually initiating a snapshot and has support for deleting snapshots .
There is also a new tool for exploring the version history of an individual file .
OpenSolaris ARM port
Another intriguing announcement is the availability of an OpenSolaris port for the ARM architecture .
Sun first started talking about bringing OpenSolaris into the mobile space in 2007 when Project Indiana was beginning to heat up .
The new ARM port could soon make this a reality .
" The OpenSolaris Operating System has many features well suited for embedded systems now and in the future .
The kernel is fully preemptable and multithreaded , it provides real - time capabilities , and the modular architecture is highly configurable , " the OpenSolaris ARM project page says .
" Because of these advanced capabilities , we feel there are interesting opportunities to extend OpenSolaris to new platforms , such as the ARM architecture . "
The initial release for ARM is based on version 2008.05 of OpenSolaris , so it does n't include the latest stuff .
It is built to run on NEC's NaviEngine 1 , a multicore ARM11 SoC that is primarily designed for car computers and portable navigation devices .
Although the OpenSolaris ARM port is still at an early stage of development , it 's likely that some of the folks at Sun are already salivating at the prospect of eventually being able to provide an end - to - end open source mobile platform built entirely with Sun 's own technologies , ranging from an OpenSolaris kernel to a JavaFX user interface .
The OpenSolaris 2009.06 release is another step forward for the project and its new feature set reflects its growing viability as an end - user platform .
The OpenSolaris ARM port is also a promising development that illustrates the growing versatility of the operating system .
To get more details about OpenSolaris 2009.06 and to download the release , see the project 's official website .
EA : Expect PlayStation 3.5 before PS4
Console manufacturers in no rush to establish new hardware due to changing markets , says COO
Matt Martin Friday 28th August 2009
Share this article Share
Companies in this article Electronic Arts
Chief creative officer of Electronic Arts , Rich Hilleman , has said that he expects format holders Sony and Microsoft will continue to work on incremental hardware updates before they reveal brand new home consoles .
Speaking at the Hot Chips conference in Stanford , Hilleman said that both company 's have pushed all their resources to establish the current consoles on the market , and will not be in any rush to develop brand new hardware in a market that is rapidly changing .
" I expected well see a PlayStation 3.5 before we see a PlayStation 4 and an Xbox 560 before we see an Xbox 720 , " said Hilleman , reports Venturebeat .
" The biggest shift is how fast packaged goods games are changing and going away . "
His comments echo those of EEDAR 's Jesse Divnich , who said last week that Sony and Microsoft 's race to win the home console wars this generations have left both company 's financially exhausted .
Hilleman noted that portable hardware , such as the DS , iPhone and PSP now outnumber home consoles by 2 - to - 1 , and the price of developing traditional console games has sky - rocketed , with marketing budgets up to three times more than the cost of developing a game .
According to the report , EA makes USD 35 on a USD 60 title , which means the game has to sell 1.1 million units just to break even .
Due to piracy and second hand sales , the sales window for a new game is at most six weeks , with long - tail sales lost to a publisher .
Burnout Paradise has twice as many users as it has units sold , due to piracy and second hand sales , said Hilleman .
Sony has always maintained the PlayStation 3 will have a 10 year lifecycle , while Microsoft has batted away any rumours of a new Xbox , with both currently focusing on varied motion control systems to re-energise the platforms from 2010 and beyond .
Tau causes tangles in brain tissue Scientists have shown a rogue protein thought to cause Alzheimer 's can spread through the brain , turning healthy tissue bad .
They believe the tau protein may share characteristics with the prion proteins which cause vCJD .
When injected into the brains of healthy mice it triggered formation of protein tangles linked to Alzheimer's .
However , experts stressed the Nature Cell Biology study did not mean tau could be passed from person to person .
This does not mean that these diseases are infectious in the same way as mad cow disease and human CJD
Professor David Allsop
Lancaster University
Tau is a protein present in all nerve cells , where it plays a key role in keeping them functioning properly .
But a rogue form of the protein can trigger the formation of protein clumps within nerve cells known as neurofibrillary tangles .
It is thought that these tangles are likely to be a major cause of Alzheimer 's disease .
In the latest study researchers , led by a team from University Hospital , Basel , extracted sections of brain from mice expressing a mutant form of human tau protein .
These extracts were injected into specific regions in the brains of healthy mice .
New tangles Analysis showed that this induced normal human tau proteins in the healthy mice to clump together to form neurofibrillary tangles .
These newly - formed tangles were also able to spread to nearby regions in the brain .
Another type of rogue protein - the prions - which cause diseases such as vCJD , are thought to be able to twist themselves into a shape which gives them the ability to " infect " nearby healthy tissue .
But until now it had not been thought that tau proteins had the same contagious property .
Dr Michel Goedert of the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge , worked on the study .
He said : " This opens new avenues in dementia research that will aim to understand how abnormal tau can spread .
" We can also investigate how diseases caused by tau aggregates and prions are similar . "
Disease progression Professor David Allsop , an expert in neuroscience at Lancaster University , said the study might help explain how tangles spread from one region of the brain to another during the course of Alzheimer's .
However , he said : " This does not mean that these diseases are infectious in the same way as mad cow disease and human CJD .
" There is no evidence that diseases like Alzheimer 's disease and Parkinson 's disease can be transmitted from one person to another . "
Rebecca Wood , chief executive of the Alzheimer 's Research Trust , said : " This greater understanding of how tangles spread in Alzheimer 's may lead to new ways of stopping them and defeating the disease . "
However , Dr Susanne Sorensen , head of research at the Alzheimer 's Society , stressed that work was carried out in genetically modified mice , and there was a lot of work to be done before the implications were fully understood .
" There is still so much we do not understand about the changes in tau that lead to tangle formation in humans and , eventually , widespread brain cell death , " she said .

BPSDB“ ExxonMobil has manufactured uncertainty about the human causes of global warming just as tobacco companies denied their product caused lung cancer , ” said Alden Meyer , the Union of Concerned Scientists ’ Director of Strategy & Policy .
“ A modest but effective investment has allowed the oil giant to fuel doubt about global warming to delay government action just as Big Tobacco did for over 40 years . ”
Scientists ’ Report Documents ExxonMobil ’s Tobacco - like Disinformation Campaign on Global Warming Science
Quiz : which of these two is actual tobacco industry denial , and which is climate change denial with “ tobacco ” and related terms substituted :
1 “ The claim that cigarette smoking causes lung cancer has not been scientifically proven ……….. it is a reductionist error and not keeping with the current theories of cancer causation to attempt to assign each cancer to an exclusive single cause ………… the use of results from flawed population studies to frighten people by attributing large numbers of death yearly to smoking may be misleading and is most regrettable ……… 2
“ There is no experimental data to support the hypothesis that smoking causes lung cancer , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , emphysema , or chronic bronchitis ……… any number of things can influence the onset of a disease .
The list includes genetics , diet , workplace environment , and stress ……. we understand public anxiety about smoking causing disease , but are concerned that many of these much - publicized associations are ill - informed and misleading
Hard to tell ?
That ’s not surprising since they are so similar .
It been two and a half years since the Union of Concerned Scientists released their report Smoke , Mirrors & Hot Air : How ExxonMobil Uses Big Tobacco ’s Tactics to Manufacture Uncertainty on Climate Science ( 68 page pdf ) and the lobbyists are still at it .
For those who are not familiar with the history of tobacco denial Lightbucket did a wonderful and very readable analysis of the tobacco industries misinformation campaigns , underscoring the tactics that we now see being used for climate change denial :
The tactics and campaigns are carbon copies ( 😉 ) and almost shocking in that only the names have been changed .
For example :
If you take TIRC ’s four - point “ distinguished authorities point out ” argument and strip out the references to tobacco , you ’re left with a template for many of the pseudoscience - based corporate disinformation campaigns that followed .
It has become a standard denialist manifesto : … research indicates many possible causes of [ …… ] ; … there is no agreement among the authorities regarding the cause of [ …… ] ; … there is no proof that [ …… ] is one of the causes ; … the validity of the statistics is questioned by numerous scientists .
Action plan :
Set up a PR front organisation masquerading as a research institute .
Tobacco , part 2 : “ A Frank Statement ”
The tactics worked for the tobacco industry for 40 years , so are we really so surprised to see them being used again ?
Particularly since it is some of the same organizations that as handling the Public Relations .
Kevin Grandia looked at the involvement of the Heartland Institute in both tobacco and climate denial in A Climate Deniers take on Tobacco Smoke , The Heartland Institute and the Academy of Tobacco Studies as did the Center for Public Integrity in Global Warming : Heated Denials , The Organized Effort to Cast Doubt on Climate Change .
And not just the same organizations , but the same people :
Read this before your start your global warming “ research ” …
And
Global warming skeptic Steven J. Milloy , for example , once headed the now - defunct Advancement of Sound Science Coalition , established in 1993 with money from cigarette maker Phillip Morris to help the company fight smoking restrictions .
Today , Milloy is the founder of junkscience.com , a website that claims to debunk climate change science , and writes a column for FoxNews.com .
Global Warming : Heated Denials
Had enough dejas vu ?
I hope not , because “ Libertarism , climate change and the tobacco lobby ” looks at how the ‘ freedoom ’ and ‘ rights ’ memes are used to create political resistance to action on climate change .
Just as health science was re-cast as an attack on individual liberties , so climate science is cast as an attack on the “ right ” to engage in environmentally destructive behaviours .
Predictably absolutely no mentions is made of the rights of the victims of climate change .
With hundreds or thousands dying , hundreds of millions being affected ( here ) and many more at risk it ’s an odd omission for those “ concerned ” with human rights .
Global warming skepticism cannot be understood without understanding the background of the skeptics , that much is sure .
The skepticism in my opinion results from a dogmatic , quasi- religious , belief in the libertarian dogma of free market capitalism without any interference .
The fallacies used in climate change discussions remind me to the fallacies made by creationists .
Anything is possible , except the dogma to be wrong .
If it requires attacking science to save the dogma , science gets attacked … “ Libertarism , climate change and the tobacco lobby ”

This warming trend has been particularly pronounced during the pre-monsoon month of May , which is now on average 4.9 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than it was in the late 1970 ’s .
The Indian Ocean warmed to a much lesser extent during this period , enhancing the temperature gradient between the ocean and the land .

“ The Cove ” is a powerful and effective piece of advocacy filmmaking , but it ’s difficult to watch it without thinking of subtitles like “ The Place Where Evil Dwells ” or “ The Little Town With the Really Big Secret . ”
Which is no accident .
“ The Cove ’s ” story of a quiet village in Japan that specializes in clandestine dolphin slaughter is quite consciously structured as a thriller by director Louie Psihoyos who won an audience award for it at Sundance .
The film follows a group of determined environmental commandos as it attempts to document what goes on in a deceptively tranquil lagoon .
The leader of the group , and hands down the most compelling person in the film , is Ric O’Barry , who became famous decades ago as the man who both captured and trained the five dolphins who collectively became TV’s Flipper and so helped start the multimillion - dollar seaquarium industry .
But after Kathy , the main “ Flipper ” dolphin , died in his arms , O’Barry had a major change of heart and became an uncompromising free - the - dolphins zealot .
“ I was as ignorant as I could be for as long as I could be , ” he explains .
“ I spent 10 years building , and the next 35 trying to tear down . ”

First - time director Psihoyos , a National Geographic photographer who is one of the founders of the Oceanic Preservation Society , got interested in O’Barry when the man was barred from speaking at a marine conference .
O’Barry told him about the town of Taiji , which masquerades as a dolphin - friendly spot but is quite the opposite .
For as “ The Cove ” takes pains to document , Taiji is , as O’Barry puts it with typical drama , “ a dolphin ’s worst nightmare . ”
Local fisherman drive the dolphins to that cove , an area that ’s protected from the prying eyes of outsiders by high fences and razor wire .
Then trainers , who have flown in from seaquariums all over the world , line up and take their pick of the candidates for $ 150,000 per animal .
Finally , those dolphins not selected as future performers are simply butchered as part of a clandestine market for dolphin meat , so secret that even most Japanese do n’t know of it .
Given the controversial nature of all this , Taiji ’s city government is hardly eager for a Western crew to get it all down on camera .
Police shadow the filmmakers everywhere , and the local fishermen , who fear the loss of revenue , aggressively confront the visitors , hoping to provoke actions that will get the foreigners expelled from the country .

Undaunted , O’Barry and Psihoyos put together a kind of dream team of environmental activists with counter - insurgency skills .
Cameras are secreted in realistic fake rocks created by George Lucas ’ ILM , and world - class free - divers place other cameras under water .
The object , says the director , is “ not just to capture the slaughter but to make people want to change . ”
The footage that results is graphic and bloody enough to make the sea run bright red , but because it has an activist slant , “ The Cove ” makes points that do n’t depend on those shots for their effectiveness .
We learn a lot about dolphin intelligence , witness the ineffectiveness of the International Whaling Commission in the face of Japanese lobbying , and learn how the high mercury levels in dolphin meat bring to mind the earlier mercury poisoning scandal at Minamata .
The small town of Taiji is far from the only place where the 23,000 dolphins that are killed worldwide per year meet their end , but what the town does has symbolic value for all concerned .
“ If we ca n’t fix that , ” O’Barry says flatly , “ forget about the bigger issues .
There ’s no hope . ”

In debates on health care , one number seems to pop up repeatedly : the claim that 45 million Americans are uninsured .
Proponents of government controlled health care argue that it is immoral to allow approximately 15 % of our fellow citizens to be left without health care .
But , there is something that they arent telling you : many ( if not most ) of those without health care in this country choose to not have health care .
Yes , at least 45 million Americans are not currently insured ( according to most studies , but Ill get back to that later ) , but a closer look at the numbers tells a different story than the one that you have probably been told in the past .
I recently read John C. Goodman ’s paper titled “ Solving the Problem of the Uninsured , ” and although I do not support the same solution that he does , I found his paper to be quite interesting .
Dr. Goodman took a hard look at the numbers and facts about the uninsured in this country and found some surprising information .
He wrote that the lack of health insurance can be compared to an experience like unemployment–many people experience it at one time or another , but it rarely is a long term problem .
For example , “ 75 % of uninsured spells are over within 12 months .
Less than 10 % last longer than 2 years . ”
Many of the uninsured are actually eligible for government or job related health care , but chose not to that advantage of it : “ there are between 10 and 14 million people who are theoretically eligible for Medicaid and SCHIP ( for low income families who do not qualify for Medicaid ) but do not bother to sign up .
This is almost one in every four uninsured persons in the country . ”
“ Furthermore , in most places people are able to enroll in Medicaid up to 3 months after they receive medical treatment .
Because these people can enroll at the drop of a hat , even after they have incurred medical expenses , are they not de facto insured even without the necessity of formal enrollment ? ”
“ A lot of other people are also voluntarily uninsured .
For example , about 9 million people ( more than one in five of the uninsured ) are eligible for employer insurance and decline to enroll even though the employer share of the premium is usually nominal . ”
Many of the uninsured in America actually have the money to purchase insurance , but for one reason or another chose not to :
“ The largest increase in the number of uninsured in recent years has occurred among higher - income families . ”
“ Further , over the past decade , the number of uninsured increased by 54 % in households earning between $ 50,000 and $ 75,000 and by 130 % among households earning $ 75,000 or more .
By contrast , in households earning less than $ 50,000 the number of uninsured decreased approximately 3 % . ”
“ Some information about middle - class families who are voluntarily uninsured is provided by a California survey of uninsured with incomes of more than 200 % of poverty .
Forty percent owned their own homes and more than half owned a personal computer .
Twenty percent worked for an employer that offered health benefits , but half of those declined coverage for which they were eligible .
This group was not opposed to insurance in general , however , because 90 % had purchased auto , home , or life insurance in the past . ”
Now , lets add all of this up : we have 10 - 14 million who are eligible for Medicaid or SCHIP , but do not enroll , and an additional 9 million that are eligible for benefits at work but do not sign up and we have between 19 and 23 million people in these two situations alone who are eligible for health insurance , but decline ( or choose not to sign up for ) it .
This takes a huge chunk out of the original 45 million number , bringing it down to a range between 22 and 26 million people who are uninsured and do not have the option to become insured .
This is a much smaller number , especially when you remember the above statistics that the vast majority of people who are uninsured are uninsured for less than a year .
But , there are also several reasons to doubt the 45 million number itself .
Dr. Goodman ’s study cites a study by the CBO which “ estimated the actual number of uninsured may be as low as 21 million . ”
He also cites “ another report [ which ] finds that , even using Census Bureau methods , the 45 million number is about 25 % too high , or off by 9 million people . ”
So , if those studies are correct , we have reduced the number of uninsured to 21 - 36 million .
And , if ( and this is THE BIG IF ) those two studies that he cited are correct and the number of uninsured is actually between 21 - 36 million , then it is safe to say that there is no major “ insurance crisis ” going on in this country .
Why ?
Well , at least 19 - 23 million Americans are eligible for health insurance or coverage but do not take advantage of it .
Combining these numbers and the above numbers from the two studies ( one of which came from the CBO ) , we are left with a range of anywhere from - 2 million to 13 million uninsured .
13 million might seem like a huge number , but it is only around 4 % of our population ( and remember 13 million was the maximum ) .
There has got to be a way to take care of this small percentage of Americans that will cost less than President Obama ’s $ 1,000,000,000,000 [ $ 1 trillion ] health care initiative .

The state 's alcoholic beverage regulators have deemed a wine label -- featuring a vintage 1895 bicycle advertising poster with a nude nymph flying alongside a winged bike -- has been rejected by the state as " immodest , " and it must be removed from grocery store and bar shelves .
Bob Martin , staff attorney with the Alabama Alcoholic Beverage Control Board , said the ABC 's licensing bureau deemed the label inappropriate last year .
" It was submitted twice last year , and it was rejected both times , " Martin said .
Early this month , however , a citizen sent a bottle of the wine to the ABC board to show it was still being sold in stores , he said .
So , the board 's enforcement bureau sent a letter to stores and restaurants statewide , reminding them that its sale was prohibited , Martin said .
The wine is produced by Hahn Family Wines in Soledad , Calif .
Efforts to contact officials with that company were unsuccessful Thursday .
A page on the company 's Web site devoted to the Cycles Gladiator wine states that :
" Americans then might have been shocked by the thought of a woman wearing pantaloons or bloomers pedaling a bicycle , but the French understood what sold products -- thus the ' uninhibited ' appearance of the Cycles Gladiator advertising poster . "
The Parisian painter G. Massias produced the advertising poster in 1895 , according to the Web site .
Title 20 of Alabama 's administrative code , which pertains to the ABC board , states that :
" No advertisement may include any illustration (s ) of any person (s ) consuming alcoholic beverages or any person (s ) posed in an immodest or sensuous manner , nor shall any advertising contain profanity or offensive language . "
Several restaurant owners , retailers and distributors declined comment when contacted Thursday by the Press - Register .
Licenses to sell or serve alcoholic beverages are renewed yearly , with applications due by Aug .

BOISE -- Boise State University is suing grocery chain Fred Meyer , alleging trademark infringements on merchandise being sold in advance of next week 's football showdown against Oregon .
The lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Boise Thursday accuses the Portland - based grocer of selling blue and orange shirts at several stores close to the BSU campus and adjacent to officially sanctioned apparel .
The shirts include statements like " Buck the Ducks " and feature pictures of a bronco kicking a duck .
University lawyers contend the shirts were not officially licensed through the school 's licensing agent and infringe on name and color scheme trademarks .
School officials tell the Idaho Business Review they 've been working to resolve the matter out of court , and the grocery chain has been cooperative .

On Friday a significant decision was handed down regarding the personal accountability of a member of the Bush administration for torture .
A U.S. District Court judge ruled that John
Yoo could be held accountable in a civil law suit for his role in drafting the Bush era policy on torture .
According to a story by staff writer Warren Richey of the Christian Science Monitor , a decision was rendered by U. S. District Court judge Jeffery White that allows former Assistant Deputy Attorney General John
Yoo to be held personally responsible in a civil lawsuit for the memos he produced that were part of authorizing the harsh interrogation techniques that many consider to be torture that was used on alleged enemy combatant Jose Padilla .
Judge
White , who I understand to have been a Bush appointee , issued a 42 page decision in which he is quoted “ Like any other government official , government lawyers are responsible for the foreseeable consequences of their conduct . ”
The full decision can be read or downloaded at the Constitutional Law Prof Blog along with a further comment on the ruling , to which I will defer as I am not a lawyer , much less a professor of Constitutional Law .
In the comment on that blog , it is noted that Judge White finds the legal cover of the memos was an unconstitutional exercise of power , and also denies Yoo ’s claim of qualified immunity .
Advertisements
This is a significant ruling in view of the recent Supreme Court decision that threw out a similar case against former AG Ashcroft , and FBI director Mueller who continues to head the FBI under the Obama administration .
These cases have been defended on behalf of Yoo , Ashcroft and Mueller , by the Department of Justice .
It has been the position of President Obama that individuals who were operating in good faith on behalf of the government should not be held acountable , investigated or prosecuted for their actions or their legal opinions .
Given the decision in this suit , and the new interest expressed by Attorney General Holder in addressing the issues involving possible illegal actions , including torture and other illegalities , we can only hope that in future the Department of Justice will find itself on the prosecuting rather than the defending side of these individuals .
As I have slogged through the 38 page document that is the part of the report by the five Inspector Generals that is not classified , allow me to share for those who do n’t have the time or inclination that it was significant who refused to be interviewed by the Inspector Generals who were performing the investigation at the direction of Congress : Yoo , former A.G. Ashcroft , former head of the CIA Tenet , and aide to former Vice President Cheney , Addision .
In view of the extremely poor quality of the legal work provided by Yoo , including the criticism for which Yoo was singled out by the five Inspectors General relating to the PSP , the President ’s Surveillance Program , among other criticism , I can only say I am surprised that Yoo continues to hold a position as a law professor at Berkely .
Being a bad government lawyer , even if you are a high profile bad lawyer , would not seem to be a very adequate recommendation for teaching .
Former A.G. Gonzales , after a period of time apparently having difficulty finding work , also turned up as a professor at Texas Tech for the fall schedule , but in political science , not law .
I would have thought , given how things worked out , that he would n’t be considered very good at either .
IT investment in security is incommensurate with the emerging threats .
Most organizations continue to approach security as if the enemy is the former Soviet Union instead of Al Qaeda .
During the cold war our defense posture relied heavily on nuclear deterrence , which meant building deadlier bombs and putting them on payload systems that could incinerate entire cities in a flash .
On 9/11 it took only a handful of Islamic crazies to bypass our entire security apparatus , shaking our foundation and nearly bringing the entire country to its knees .
firewalls and anti-virus software .
These are the equivalent of ICBMS swallowing up more and more of the security budget .
Both are needed but they do n't come close to addressing the new generation of risks .

There it was , in The Arizona Republic .
It had to be true : Real - estate cycles still mysterious .
The article started with the timeworn cliché , “ This real - estate downturn has entered uncharted territory . ”
Obviously , the writer had not read Meltdown by Thomas E. Woods Jr .
The third paragraph provided still more evidence that the writer had not read Wood ’s bestseller .
“ Much less is known about housing boom and bust cycles than , say , historic performance patterns for the stock or bond markets . ”
To support his position , the writer cited an unnamed report released in June by the Federal Housing Finance Agency .
The report asserted that “ Most of the larger historical downturns were caused by sharp increases in unemployment rates and shocks to personal income . ”
But , as the writer admitted , these factors were not in play when housing “ started into its tailspin for other reasons . ”
Although the author went on with statistics about the housing bust and offered opinions about recovery , he did not discuss the “ other reasons ” for the bust .
He could have , though , had he read only chapter four of Meltdown :
How government causes the boom - bust business cycle .
Citing the work of F.A. Hayek , the 1974 Nobel Prize winner in economics for his theory of the business cycle and the work of the esteemed free - market economist Ludwig von Mises , Woods lays the blame for our housing bust at the feet of the Federal Reserve , the central bank for the United States .
Although posturing as the “ protector of the economy and the source of relief from business cycles , ” the Fed is the cause of the business cycle as it distorts the business community ’s perception as to the availability and the cost of money .
“ As with all goods , ” Woods notes , “ the supply of loanable funds sometimes goes up and down , and on the other hand demand for loanable funds goes up and down .
The supply and demand determine the price ( of money ) . ”
When people are saving more , the supply of money is up and interest rates are down .
“ From a business ’s perspective , low interest rates provide an opportunity to engage in long - term projects that would not pay off under higher interest rates . ”
. . .
But then the Fed steps in
End the Fed Ron Paul Best Price : $ 1.12 Buy New $ 8.53 ( as of 10:10 EST - Details )
Using several mechanisms at its disposal ( Woods explains the Fed ’s workings in chapter six . ) , the Fed artificially manipulates interest rates , distorting the business community ’s perception of the real cost of money and the real availability of money .
And , because the economy “ can support only so many investment projects at once , ” many business ventures turn into busts when not enough funds are available .
This scenario plays out most often when the Fed drives down interest rates , as it did under Alan Greenspan in 2001 with eleven consecutive rate cuts .
From June 2003 to June 2004 , the discount rate ( the rate at which banks lend to each other and an important benchmark for interest rates ) stood at a 1 % .
Although the Fed ’s efforts did not reignite a faltering stock market , as the Fed had hoped , they did kick off a housing boom , which , of course , brought us the housing bust when it became evident that not enough funds were available to continue lending .
And the rest , as they say , is history .
Boom - bust cycles are neither mysterious nor unexplainable .
Grasping boom - bust cycles takes only a rudimentary understanding of Austrian economic theory , and Meltdown goes a long way in providing that understanding .
It is must read for persons seeking an understanding to what is happening in our economy and what we can expect if the government continues to interfere in the marketplace .

Need I repeat myself ?
Greentech will succeed when and where it ’s profitable .
The oil giant Exxon Mobil , whose chief executive once mocked alternative energy by referring to ethanol as “ moonshine , ” is about to venture into biofuels .
On Tuesday , Exxon plans to announce an investment of $ 600 million in producing liquid transportation fuels from algae — organisms in water that range from pond scum to seaweed .
The biofuel effort involves a partnership with Synthetic Genomics , a biotechnology company founded by the genomics pioneer J. Craig Venter .
Another venture founded in science and technology that papier - mache pundits lampooned as unrealistic and too far ahead of its time .
Despite the widely publicized “ moonshine ” remark a few years ago by Exxon ’s chairman and chief executive , Rex W. Tillerson , the company has spent several years exploring various fuel alternatives , according to one of its top research officials .
“ We literally looked at every option we could think of , with several key parameters in mind , ” said Emil Jacobs , vice president for research and development at Exxon ’s research and engineering unit .
“ Scale was the first .
For transportation fuels , if you ca n’t see whether you can scale a technology up , then you have to question whether you need to be involved at all . ”
He added , “ I am not going to sugarcoat this — this is not going to be easy . ”
Any large - scale commercial plants to produce algae - based fuels are at least 5 to 10 years away , Dr. Jacobs said .
Oilgae - powered Mercedes at the Sundance Festival
But if it proves a bona fide effort , Exxon ’s move into biofuels , long the preserve of venture capital firms and biotech start - ups , could provide a big push to the Obama administration ’s policy of encouraging more renewable energy …
Exxon ’s partnership with Synthetic Genomics is also a vote of confidence in the work of Dr. Venter , a maverick scientist best known for decoding the human genome in the 1990s .
In recent years , he has focused his attention on a search for micro-organisms that could be turned into fuel …
Algal biofuel , sometimes nicknamed oilgae by environmentalists , is a promising technology .
Fuels derived from algae have molecular structures that are similar to petroleum products , including gasoline , diesel and jet fuel , and would be compatible with the existing transportation infrastructure , according to Exxon .
It has n’t been long since Venter just smiled and said something like , “ you ’ll be hearing about genomic designs in biofuel ” .
The analysts who sit back on their rusty - dustys and prattle reactionary crap about digital this can’t succeed ; computer modeling achieves nothing ;
Green alternatives will never be profitable – should think about getting an honest job .
Part of the commercial equation is the task of developing a means to make a process or product profitable .

High Dynamic Range ( HDR ) images can really take your photography to the next level .
But creating compelling HDR images , whether through fake HDR techniques in Photoshop or multiple exposures and tone - mapping , can be tricky .
Creating portraits can be even trickier , because human subjects are often less forgiving in HDR photos .
But you can do a few different things to get better results with your HDR portraits every time .
Below are 20 examples of excellent portraits representing a variety of HDR techniques .
For great HDR portraits , first make sure the skin of your subjects does n’t take on gray tones , which can make them look like zombies and is n’t exactly attractive .
This is a common problem with fake HDR images .
Make sure your subjects are n’t moving in the image , either .
Blurring from hand and arm movement is the most common , because keeping these limbs perfectly still for more than a few seconds is difficult .
You can fix blurring in the processing stage if you watch out for it .
This generally is n’t an issue with fake HDR images ( unless the image is blurry to begin with ) , but it can be a big problem with real HDRs done with tone - mapping and multiple images .
Do n’t make your images too flat .
Again , this is more common with fake HDR , but spoiling a tone - mapped image is possible , too , if you process it too much .
Flat images , especially of people , tend to look fake and lifeless .
Remember that the original purpose of HDR photography was to make images more accurately show the colors and shadows that the human eye perceives .
Keep this in mind when creating your own images and you ’ll likely get better results .
Producing great HDR images that are artistic and creative , without looking strange , is still possible .
Which ones are your favorites ?
Feel free to share your own HDR portraits with us in the comments ’ area below …
With its trout stream , village cricket pitch and sedate tearoom , Abinger Hammer is a quintessential slice of village England .
Recently , this jewel of the Surrey stockbroker belt has added a more unconventional element to its list of attractions – a 6ft transvestite squatter called Delores Kane who believes he is the Messiah and happens to be Britain 's best - known renegade former spy .
A short distance from the home of the novelist E M Forster , David Shayler and his miniskirt - clad alter ego have taken up residence in a 17th - century National Trust farmhouse after a decade of spiritual contemplation which has led the one - time MI5 officer to the conclusion that he is the reincarnation of Jesus Christ and that all of humanity 's ills can be cured by a four - year programme of hemp cultivation .
For the man who came to public attention in spectacular fashion 12 years ago by lifting the lid on a catalogue of dark deeds allegedly carried out in the name of Queen and Country by the intelligence services , it is a reinvention every bit as dramatic as his claims that MI6 funded Islamist fighters to assassinate Libya 's Colonel Gaddafi and that MI5 failed to keep track of an IRA bombing cell – revelations that ultimately forced him into exile and earned him two spells in prison .

But as he came to the door of the salubrious squat close to Guildford dressed as Delores in a blonde wig , sheer black tights , a leopard skin skirt and a cropped top with prosthetic breasts , before explaining that the world as it is known will end of 23 December 2012 , it is perhaps clear why some of his former friends are concerned that he has suffered some form of mental collapse .
Sat on a floor cushion in a fug of joss stick smoke in the sitting room of Hackhurst Farm , a 400 - year - old rural idyll at the end of a country lane which he has occupied since last month with a group of eco-campaigners , the 43 - year - old former spy outlined his journey from an atheist in charge of MI5's Libya desk to the stiletto - heeled messianic proclaimer of a crusade to dismantle a " Zionist empire " , whose control is apparently exerted over the planet by nefarious means from vaccines to mortgages .
Far from being unwell , Mr Shayler insisted he was merely following the same instincts that persuaded him to blow the whistle on the alleged misdeeds of MI5 and MI6 in 1997 – and illegally print extracts from Spycatcher while a student – by bringing into the open unpalatable " facts " about the state of humanity .
He said : " I am absolutely well .
I have not had a breakdown .
My job in MI5 was to stop terrorism and violence .
What I saw within the service showed that was not always the case and I had the courage to stand up and tell the difficult truths about what was going on .
" I have spent my life telling difficult truths and now I am in the same situation again .
I am the latest reincarnation of the Christ and live a life of unconditional love .
Suddenly my whole life makes sense .
By exercising the common law right of free will , we can all break out of the system that has enslaved us , started wars and left us mired in debt . "
Looking much thinner than the rotund spy who spent four months in a French prison without charge in 1998 and was then later sentenced to six months ' imprisonment in Britain for breaching the Official Secrets Act , Mr Shayler is fond of expounding on the many " signs " ( from biblical codes to the film The Da Vinci Code ) which he says have proved him that he is the current incarnation of the Messiah – a role he says was previously performed by King Arthur , Mark Antony , Macbeth , Lawrence of Arabia and his immediate predecessor as the embodiment of Christ , Che Guevara .
Between drags on a roll - up cigarette , he explained how the engravings on the Rod of Aaron , the staff carried by Moses ' older brother in the Old Testament , contained an anagram of " David Shayler , Righteous King " .

Referring to the moment on 29 June 2007 when he said he realised his divinity after a premonition that he had stopped a bomb attack on a London nightclub , he said : " It was a deeply , deeply humbling experience .
I felt this incredible energy , way beyond any sexual or physical experience .
It was way , way beyond where I had been before .
" What do you do in those circumstances ?
I fell to my knees and prostrated myself .
I had become the spirit of Jesus . "
Some 12 years after he first revealed the details of intelligence service operations to the Mail on Sunday for £ 40,000 – including claims that MI5 kept files on senior Labour Party figures in the early 1990s and ignored warnings of an attack on the Israeli embassy which subsequently took place – Mr Shayler 's transformation has revived suggestions that he is as much a showman as an earthly cipher for " difficult truths " .
One former counter - terrorism official told The Independent : " It would not be right to form any opinion about his current state of mind .
But [ David Shayler ] chose to go public in 1997 and he made it clear that he was going to make the most of it .
I suppose the question is whether that was underpinned by some inner need for spectacle . "
Whatever his motivation , the result is a bewildering mishmash of conspiracy , practicality and spirituality that wanders from the well - trodden hypothesis that 9/11 was " an inside job " to the idea that widespread planting of hemp as a source of food , drugs and building materials would provide a sustainable basis for all human life within four years .
Alongside disarming frankness about his transvestism ( Delores is the manifestation of a clothes - swapping habit that dates back to his teenage years and his conviction that " Jesus is a tranny " ) , Mr Shayler outlines how Castrol GTX adverts are a subliminal reference to God , and Gaia , the spirit linking all life , will rise up in December 2012 and reshape the cosmos .
He is also complimentary about David Icke , the former BBC sports presenter who has gone before him in revealing himself as Jesus 's reincarnation before suggesting the world is controlled by shape - shifting lizards .
Mr Shayler said : " David has done some enormously important work .
I see him as the John the Baptist to my Christ .
I have spoken to him on the phone and suggested we meet . "
Those who know the former MI5 operative , a fanatic Middlesbrough FC fan who also believes his channelling of " unconditional love " propelled his side into the 2006 Uefa Cup Final , believe he is paying the psychological price for the years of media pressure and pursuit by the authorities .
Annie Machon , his former girlfriend , said : " I believe David is a good and honorable man but he has had some form of severe breakdown .
I do blame the Government and the intelligence agencies for what he had become . "
Psychologists warned that the espousal of unusual beliefs should not be interpreted as proof of mental illness .
Simon Gelsthorpe , a clinical psychologist based in Bradford , said : " A lot of research over the last decade has looked into the occurrence in the normal population of traits that society has traditionally seen as a mental illness .
Hearing voices is way more common than we had thought , as is the holding of unusual beliefs .
A lot of these so - called indicators of mental illness are in fact relatively common and part of normal life . "
For his part , the former spy and self - confessed user of cannabis and magic mushrooms is unapologetic in his certainty that he is now the subject of a higher calling : " I do n't give a fuck what other people think of me .
A bloke in a frock is whole lot less offensive than blowing up innocent people in Iraq and Afghanistan . "
Whistleblowers :
The intelligence service renegades
* Peter Wright
The former principal science officer of MI5 , pictured right , provoked a crisis in intelligence circles with the publication in 1987 of Spycatcher , his incendiary memoir outlining claims that the Security Service plotted to remove Harold Wilson from office and its Director General , Roger Hollis , was a Soviet spy .
Margaret
Thatcher 's government fought a long and ultimately pointless legal battle to prevent publication , propelling worldwide sales beyond 2 million copies .
* Richard Tomlinson
The New Zealand - born MI6 agent , far right , was a star recruit to Britain 's overseas intelligence agency , serving in Bosnia and infiltrating Iranian intelligence .
But a glittering career was abruptly ended in 1995 when he was sacked for reasons that remain unexplained and prevented from taking his case to an employment tribunal .
He was arrested in 1997 for breaching the Official Secrets
Act on the basis of a four - page synopsis of a tell - all book on his service and jailed for 12 months .
He told the Princess Diana inquest that MI6 trained its officers in the use of strobe lights to cause traffic accidents .
* Cathy Massiter
Middle - ranking MI5 officer lifted the lid on its surveillance of trade unions and organisations such as CND in the 1980s .
She revealed in a documentary that the service bugged the phones of Patricia Hewitt , former health secretary , and Harriet Harman , deputy Labour leader , because they were suspected Communist sympathisers .
Party to host its first gay pride event at Manchester conference in October
This article is more than 11 years old

The Conservatives will promote a gay - friendly logo at their annual conference this autumn in a bid to attract new voters .
The rainbow symbol – widely used to signify pride in the gay community – has been co-opted by the Tories in a makeover of the party 's green and blue tree emblem .
The multicoloured version will be used to signify the party as a " broad church " when it hosts its first gay pride event at the annual Tory conference , taking place in Manchester in October .
Ben Summerskill , the chief executive of the gay rights lobby group Stonewall , has been invited to give an address as David Cameron seeks to shed the party 's old image and present it as more tolerant and inclusive .
The Tory leader used an interview in the gay press in the run-up to last month 's London gay pride event to apologise for section 28 , the notorious legislation , brought in by the Thatcher government , which banned the " promotion " of homosexuality in schools .
Cameron voted against the repeal of section 28 as recently as 2003 , when it was taken off the statute books .
Three years later , in his first speech as party leader , he sought to adopt a new stance when he hailed the introduction of civil partnerships .
In October , the Conservatives will invite conference delegates to celebrate gay pride .
More than 700 are expected to attend a £ 15 - a - head event at the Spirit Bar in Canal Street – the centre of Manchester 's gay scene – which will have " surprise special guests " and a speech from an as yet unidentified senior shadow cabinet member .
I 've had my GF for 2 years now ( practically lives with me ) - small white , petite thing , cooks for me , always been good to me .
I go away on holiday for a week , come back and something just does n't seem right .
I asked my dad if he had seen anything happen with my GF and he acts clueless .
So fast forward to 3 weeks later ...
I 'm coming home from work when BAM clear as day , right in my Kitchen I catch my father red handed with his meat in my GF .
I was PISSED , told him to get his meat out of GF and GTFO , needless to say my GF got turned off .
I just could n't get over it and that night kicked my GF to the curb .
Now it 's been 2 weeks since the incident and that I 've been without my GF and about 10 minutes ago my dad had the audacity to ask my how my GF has been , when he 's the damn reason we ain't together no more .
Should I get off the computer and start swinging at him ?
OR
Pack my stuff and be on my way .
Here 's pics of my GF for you lot as I know you 'll ask .

CULIACAN , Mexico —
The colossal water cistern set in a clearing in a hilly , heavily forested area can hold 25,000 liters of water — enough to irrigate a major food farm .
But follow the pipes down and there , beneath a corrugated iron roof and resting on hay bales , and its real , more sinister purpose is revealed .
Here in the heat of northern Mexico , the factory churned out record amounts of methamphetamine — known on the American streets as crystal meth , or ice — a drug that has torn through the United States and become the biggest growth area for cartels south of the border .
U.S. police have known for several years that the cartels were gaining strength in the meth trade , taking over a business that used to be run by American biker gangs that cooked up crystal in buckets and bath tubs .
But a recent series of raids by the Mexican military revealed that the cartel meth factories have become even bigger and more sophisticated than previously thought .
Busted in June , the factory in the clearing near this unwieldy Mexican city is estimated to have produced 40 metric tons of meth , worth some $ 1.4 billion on American streets , in just two months before it was shut down — making it the largest operation of its kind to be exposed in the continent .
Huge barrels with the precursor chemical pseudoephedrine also fill the factory , unleashing a foul smell throughout the clearing .
Next to the vats and barrels stand rows of towering mobile gas tanks and a tangle of electric cables sprawling from a large generator .
“ Mexico now has some massive and very sophisticated operations .
We call them super labs , ” said the Drug Enforcement Agency ’s Elizabeth Kempshall , special agent in charge of the Phoenix Division .
Kempshall follows the meth production in Mexico because tons of the produce are trafficked through her jurisdiction in Arizona .
This vast supply has helped boost consumption of the drug — which looks like a white flaky crystal and can be smoked in pipes as well as injected or snorted .
Meth is now the most popular hard drug in America ’s Midwest and West , ahead of cocaine and heroin , according to the DEA .
This surge has come about as gangsters have developed new , concentrated forms of meth that are more potent than any other drugs on the market .
“ You smoke meth and it can give you a high twice as long as crack cocaine , ” Kempshall said .
“ While crack cocaine focused on the inner cities , meth has swept the whole nation , especially the suburbs . ”
The euphoric effect of crystal can allow people to work for days without rest , fuel hectic parties and give users unstoppable libidos .
But addicts soon fall foul of the drug ’s longer lasting effects , suffering chronic paranoia , violent tendencies and tooth loss — known as meth mouth .
“ Meth can make you rob and fight without thinking about it .
It just amplifies the real evil side of people , ” said Craig Stuart , a stocky 25 - year old addict , recovering in a rehab center in Phoenix .
The dollars spent by junkies such as Stuart provide immense wealth south of the border .
In 2007 , police swept on a Mexico City mansion to find $ 207 million piled up in huge mountains of notes in what the DEA said was the biggest cash bust in world history .
The homeowner Zhenli Ye Gon , a Chinese national , was later arrested in the United States , where he is now standing trial for selling raw chemicals to cartels for the production of meth .
Such immense profits lead to bloody turf battles in a country where the minumum wage is just $ 5 a day .
Nearly 4,000 people have been killed in drug - related violence in Mexico this year despite the army patrolling the streets to keep order .
The meth trade has also helped spawn new ultra-violent gangs such as La Familia Michoacana , a crime syndicate based in the lush highlands of western Mexico .
Emerging in 2006 , La Familia is alleged to have produced hundreds of tons of crystal in its rolling hills and used the money to finance an army of killers to protect its trade .
After the federal police this year busted 39 meth labs belonging to La Familia and nabbed some of its kingpins , the group hit back hard , its gunmen attacked police bases across the region with grenades and assault rifles .
They then kidnapped 12 police off - duty officers , tortured and shot them , and lined up their corpses on a road .
“ Try and arrest another one of us , ” said a note in scrawling handwriting next to the bodies .
“ We are waiting for you here . ”

絵文字の収録をめぐって、国際規格で大論争--「Google提案」を振り返る
皆さんこんにちは、面白くてタメになる（？）文字コード漫談の時間がやってまいりました。2月からとびとびで書いてきた絵文字の報告も、いよいよ今回が最終回。どうかよろしくお付き合いください。
さて、前回はどこまでお話ししたのでしたっけ。日本の絵文字をUnicodeに収録しようとするGoogleとAppleによる提案（以下、主導者の名をとりGoogle提案と略）ですが、去年の12月にパブリックレビューが開始されると、Unicode-MLで時ならぬ非難の嵐が吹き荒れたこと。そこでの反発を一言で言い表すなら、日本の文化に強く依存する絵文字を単純に国際規格に収録しようとした点にあったこと。
なぜなら国際規格の審議は参加各国の総意で成り立っており、特定の国しか便利に使えない文字を収録することは、当然強い反対をうけるからです。さらに言えば、Google提案とはそういう絵文字に対し「ソース分離」という手法をつかい、重複を除き1文字の漏れもなく収録しようとするものであったこと。Unicodeの原則では似た字は統合されますから、これは破格の優遇策と言えます。
そんな強引とも言え るGoogle提案ではあったけれど、その社員で、かつUnicodeコンソーシアム理事長であるマーク・デイビス自らが主導することもあってか、無事にUnicodeの最高議決機関、UTC会議で承認され、今度はいよいよ国際規格ISO/IEC
10646への収録を目指して4月20〜24日に開かれたWG2ダブリン会議に提案が持ち込まれたこと（UnicodeとISO/IEC
10646の関係については第3回の冒頭をご参照ください）。
ところがよせばいいのに、デイビスがUnicode-MLでWG2参加国を刺激するようなことを書いてしまい、それをプライベートに参加していたナショナルボディ（代表団。以下、NBと略）メンバーが見とがめたものだからさあ大変、ダブリン会議はUnicode-MLでの大論争の第2ラウンドとなる予感をはらみつつ、幕を開けることになってしまった……。とまあ、こんなところでしょうか。
Google提案の審議はどんな流れになるのか
通 常WG2では、本番となる会議が開催される前に、各NBは色々な文書を提出し合います。追加したい文字の提案、懸案事項へのコメント、あるいは他国が寄せた文書に反対する意見もあります。こうしてあらかじめ審議するテーマとそれへの各々の立場を、あらかじめ明確にすることで本番の会議が効率の良いものとなります（実際にはなかなか思い通りにならないのは、いずこも同じ）。
これらの文書 はWG2のサイトで基本的に公開されることになっています。つまり、どこの国から、いつ、どのような文書が提出されたかを追っていけば、会議での対立軸がある程度分かることになります。もちろん絵文字をめぐる提案の場合も同じです。
まずGoogle提案がUTC会議で承認された約1カ月後の3月5日、一部を修正の上WG2に提出され、サイトで公開されました。これは以下の3つの書類からなっています。
N3582（PDF ） 『Proposal for encoding Emoji symbols ( includes proposal summary form ) 』（絵文字シンボル符号化の提案／提案書式をふくむ）［提案者による和訳（PDF）］
N3583 （PDF ） 『Emoji Symbols Proposed for New Encoding For the Proposal for Encoding Emoji Symbols 』（「 絵文字シンボル符号化の提案」のための絵文字シンボル新規符号化の提案）
N3585 （PDF ） 『Emoji Sources』（絵文字の原規格）
このうちN3582は提案書そのもの、N3583は1文字ずつのデザインや名前を記したいリスト、そしてN3585は3キャリアとのマッピング表です。その具体的な内容については、今までさんざん述べてきたからよいでしょう。興味深いのは、ほとんど同時に以下の文書にGoogle提案の絵文字がそっくり追加されていることです。
N3580 （PDF ） 『Pre-meeting 54 charts showing characters in the pipeline - Charts for new repertoire , including PDAM7』（第54回会議以前の新レパートリ一覧表／PDAM7をふくむ）
PDAM7 とは「 Proposed Draft Amendment 7」の略で、和訳すると 「追補7提案書草案」ということになりましょうか。ISO/IEC
10646は1300ページを越える大部の規格です。文字を追加するたびに出版し直したりすると効率が悪いので、「Amendment（追補）」という形で変更分だけ出版し、それ等が一定程度たまると新しい版を出すことにしています。現在の2003年版では追補5まで出版されていて、追補6と7が審議中。その片方がこのPDAM7というわけです。Google提案は、このPDAM7に入れるかどうかをダブリン会議で審議されることになりました（※2）。
ところで追補の草案は、何度も投票を繰り返しながらチェックと修正を重ねるごとに以下のように名前を変え、完成度を高めていきます。

Next time you ’re at a baseball or football game in a stadium with 40,000 fans , consider this :
More than 4,000 of them are on antidepressants .
One of every 10 Americans are now on medication for depression , according to a new study in the August Archives of General Psychiatry .
That ’s a doubling of the rate over 10 years , from 1996 through 2005 .
Actual figures were 5.85 percent of the population ( 13 million ) in 1996 and 10.2 percent ( 27 million ) in 2005 .
Use of antidepressants increased across all sociodemographic groups except African Americans .
Two other interesting tidbits emerged from the study .
One is that , while the number of people taking antidepressants soared , the number of patients on medication who were also getting psychotherapy ( talk therapy ) dropped .
Studies have shown that a combination of talk therapy and medication may be most effective for treatment of depression , but apparently more people are getting antidepressants from their primary care physician and leaving it at that .
But perhaps more disturbing is the reason behind the trend .
True , taking meds for depression has become more socially acceptable .
But the authors of the study — Mark Olfson of Columbia University in New York and Steven Marcus of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia – wrote that :
“ Although there was little change in total promotional spending for antidepressants between 1999 ( $ 0.98 billion ) and 2005 ( $ 1.02 billion ) , there was a marked increase in the percentage of this spending that was devoted to direct - to consumer advertising , from 3.3 percent ( $ 32 million ) to 12 percent ( $ 122.00 million ) . ”
In other words , the relentless bombardment on TV commercials is paying off for the big pharmaceutical companies .
It was a $ 9.6 billion industry in 1998 .
There are plenty of critics unhappy with the antidepressant drug boom .
One is Eric Caine , psychiatrist at the University of Rochester in New York , He told Reuters : “ There are no data to say that the population is healthier ” because of the upward trend in antidepressant use .
“ Indeed , the suicide rate in the middle years of life has been climbing . ”

Israel is planning to remove 23 " illegal outposts " from the West Bank in the course of a single day in response to mounting US demands that it halt all settlement activity , it was reported today .
These outposts are defined as illegal by the Israeli government because they have not received planning permission .
But under international law all settlements built on occupied territory are illegal .
According to the Ha'aretz newspaper the outposts , housing 1,200 people , will all be evacuated and dismantled simultaneously following a decision by the Likud prime minister , Benjamin Netanyahu .
The Israeli army denied receiving any orders for a " lightning evacuation " .
Settler spokesmen warned of a furious response if any such move took place .
Israel has only twice evacuated Jewish settlements since the 1967 war : in 1981 when the Sinai desert was returned to Egypt , and in 2005 , when Israel unilaterally withdrew troops and settlers from the Gaza Strip .
Removing settlers from the West Bank will be far more controversial .
Israel has told the US it would remove " illegal " outposts built after March 2001 .
The current activity is in response to unprecedented pressure from Washington , where President Barack Obama has departed sharply from the informal acquiescence of the Bush administration .
Dan Meridor , a deputy prime minister with a reputation for moderation , insisted that tacit " understandings " with Bush still bound the Obama administration .
Netanyahu has insisted that construction must be permitted in existing settlements to accommodate what he calls " natural growth " in their populations .
In all , nearly 500,000 Israelis now live in the West Bank and East Jerusalem , both claimed by the Palestinians as part of their future independent state .
Tensions have flared in recent days since Netanyahu said the US had no right to demand that Israel halt plans to develop 20 apartments in the East Jerusalem neighbourhood of Sheikh Jarrah .
On Monday , campaigners protesting at the planned eviction of Palestinian families to make way for it appealed to Obama to stop the settlement .
Mahmoud Abbas , the Palestinian president , said today : " What is required from Israel is to freeze all settlement activity .
When Israel meets these demands , we will be ready to go to the final negotiations . "
France 's foreign minister , Bernard Kouchner , meanwhile summoned the Israeli ambassador to Paris to complain about Jewish settlements .
" These activities must be stopped , " warned Kouchner , " otherwise there will be no chance to found an independent Palestinian state that administers itself and also guarantees Israel 's security . "
Britain 's foreign office minister , Ivan Lewis , told MPs : " Israel should freeze all settlement activity , including the natural growth of existing settlements , and dismantle all outposts erected since March 2001 . "
Sweden , current president of the EU , also urged Israel " to refrain from provocative actions in East Jerusalem , including home demolitions and evictions . "
It added : " Such actions are illegal under international law . "

The Booklet has 3G , Bluetooth , and wi-fi connectivity
The world 's largest manufacturer of mobile phones will join the PC market with its Booklet 3G netbook .
The Windows - based device is about 2 cm thick and will offer 3G connectivity as well as wi-fi .
Analysts said the laptop was a " natural extension " of the company 's product range but the firm would face stiff competition .
Nokia will release price and availability information at an event in Stuttgart on 2 September .
The Booklet has an aluminium case , weighs 1.25 kilograms ( 2.75 lbs ) and its 10 - inch screen is HD - ready .
Nokia has released a number of small , " tablet " - style internet - enabled devices in the past to mixed reviews , but this is the first effort which is claimed to be a full - function PC .
" A growing number of people want the computing power of a PC with the full benefits of mobility , " said Kai Oistamo , Nokia 's executive vice president for devices .
" We are in the business of connecting people and the Nokia Booklet 3G is a natural evolution for us . "
Crowded market
The Booklet also has integrated Bluetooth , GPS , a webcam and an SD card reader .
Nokia claims it has a 12 - hour battery life .
But if the Booklet has an edge in the crowded netbook market , it may lie in the device 's heritage .
" Nokia now faces new and different competitors for the Booklet that are strong in the laptop PC space such as Dell , HP and Sony that are weak or non-existent players in mobile phones , " wrote Forrester analyst Ian Fogg on his blog .
Mr Fogg said the Booklet 's unique selling point was an " internal mobile broadband card with a SIM slot . "
" Other netbooks rely on external USB mobile broadband modems for Internet access , " he wrote on his blog .
" The presence of this internal wireless modem is why the Booklet 3G is a natural extension to Nokia 's traditional phone handset product range . "
I like to think of my mental awesome - o- meter , that is , the gauge I use to determine how awesome a game is as something similar to one of those really old analog pressure gauges you might find on a submarine somewhere .
Every so often a game comes along that is just so terrible that the ol ’ awesome - o- meter goes so far in to the red that it comes back up on the other side .
Enviro - Bear 2010 [ App Store ] , my friends , is a game which causes this phenomenon .
Yes , Enviro - Bear 2010 is a bear driving a car simulator where you have five minutes to fatten yourself up and drive to your cave in preparation for winter .
The controls are hilariously awful , and while the iPhone may be capable of multi - touch gestures , as a bear driving a car you only have one free paw which is what you use to drive around and scarf down food .
You can use your single paw to do all kinds of things , from putting the car in to drive or reverse , throwing just about anything ( including the clock tracking your remaining time ) out the window , and defending yourself from badgers .
The driving controls provide as realistic of an experience as I can imagine if I were a bear driving a car , since you can either steer or use the pedals .
With only one paw , how could you both at the same time ?
It was n’t until I played the game through a few cycles of winter that I started to realize the depth of how much you can interact with the world .
Such a seemingly terrible game at first glance really has a odd level of detail , especially when you start thinking outside the box , or rather –
Thinking like a bear , driving a car .
For instance , the horrid combination of constantly switching between the gas and steering is completely remedied by something so simple that it had n’t even crossed my mind until I saw someone mention it in the thread on our forums .
If you ram your car in to a boulder , a piece of rock will fall off , and you can use that rock to hold the gas pedal down .
Enviro - Bear 2010 is filled with all kinds of really weird functionality of interaction between objects that you never would expect .
This realization transformed the game for me from a comically bad driving game to a clever , imaginative , and strangely enjoyable experience .
( And I ’m not the only one ) .
If you are looking for a completely ridiculous game with graphics so bad that they ’re good and really awkward bear - inspired controls , look no further than Enviro - Bear 2010 .
Sure , you could buy better things for a dollar , but do those things involve a world where bears drive cars ?
I did n’t think so .

MIT professor Missy Cummings used to fly F / A - 18 Hornet fighters for the Navy .
" I spent whole time complaining – who was the moron who designed this thing ? " she recalled .
If you 've ever peeked inside a fighter cockpit , you 'll understand her gripe .
Dials , displays and controls pack every nook and cranny .
It 's the farthest thing from ergonomic .
The problem stuck with Cummings , after she got out of the Navy .
She went on to get a Ph.D. in " cognitive systems engineering " before getting hired at MIT , where she heads the Humans and Automation Lab , or HAL .
" There 's a joke in the name , " she pointed out .
Her crew of 30 grad students and undergrads is chasing a number of new ideas and technologies , all aimed at easing the sometimes unwieldy interactions between machines and their human masters .
As an example , she refers to the complex , suitcase - sized controller that soldiers must haul around to control hand - thrown Raven unmanned aerial vehicles , or UAVs .
Cummings wants something simpler .
And what could be simpler than an iPhone ?
Actually , using an iPhone was her undergrads ' idea – because experimenting with it as a basis for a new robot controller meant she'd have to buy them all iPhones of their own .
" We had the idea in June , " Cummings told Danger Room .
" In six weeks , we went from the idea to a real flight test , " using MIT 's indoor robot range .
( See video . )
The total cost ?
$ 5,000 for a new , commercially available , quad - rotor robot – plus the cost of iPhones for her crew .
The iPhone bot controller is basically just an app , like any other .
It relies on only the iPhone 's existing gear , and the phone can still be used for regular calls , web - browsing , texting , etc. HAL 's bot - wrangling app sends GPS coordinates to the robot , which navigates around using its own , built - in " sense- and - avoid " capabilities .
Along the way , the bot can stream video or snapshots back to the iPhone .
" Our philosophy of control in my lab is humans should never do tele - operating , " Cummings said .
In other words , no steering .
" Our philosophy is that humans have important jobs they need to do , and should not worry about low - level housekeeping , telling a UAV to go from point to point .
UAVs are smart , and can do that on their own these days . "
The kind of ( somewhat - detached ) relationship she has in mind is called " supervisory control . "

A day in the life of Ingushetia
ON JULY 7th , as Barack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev discussed world security in the Kremlin , people charged with security in Chechnya kidnapped a local man and his son .
Twelve hours later the man was dragged from a car in his underwear and executed before a few villagers .
And this was but one of many punitive actions taken by Chechen authorities against relatives of alleged rebels .
It was brought to light by Natalia Estemirova , a human - rights activist who has chronicled kidnappings , torture and killings for a decade on behalf of Memorial , Russia 's oldest human - rights group .
Ms Estemirova received prizes in Europe , but no thanks from her government .
On July 15th , as she left home in Chechnya , she herself was kidnapped .
A few hours later she was found dead in neighbouring Ingushetia .
Her hands were tied and she had two bullets in her head and chest .
Ms Estemirova 's murder topped the headlines of foreign television networks , but was mentioned only in passing by Russian channels , despite a prompt condemnation from Mr Medvedev .
Her colleagues say that her work had outraged Ramzan Kadyrov , Chechnya 's president .
They blame him for her murder ( though Mr Kadyrov pledged to lead the investigation into her murder himself ) .
Chechnya is no longer considered a “ zone of a counter - terrorist operation ” .
This status was removed a few months ago at the request of Mr Kadyrov .
Since then the number of disappearances , house burnings and killings has risen .
Even before Ms Estemirova 's murder , Ekaterina Sokiryanskaya , a colleague , talked of escalating fear in the region and pressure on human - rights activists .
“ Natalia [ Estemirova ] , who tried to fight the victims ' cases , was braver than many of the relatives , ” she said after the murder .
Fear and force have been Mr Kadyrov 's main tools of governance .
As a former rebel , he has coerced those who fought alongside him and got rid of those who opposed him .
He has turned Chechnya into his fief , more Russia 's ally than its subject .
Across the region , killings and kidnappings have become common .
Ingushetia has descended into what amounts to a civil war , says Grigory Shvedov of Caucasian Knot , an independent news service .
The killing of policemen has become systematic .
In an especially daring attack on June 22nd , rebels used a suicide - bomber to try to kill Yunus - Bek Yevkurov , Ingushetia 's president .
His driver and a bodyguard were killed ; he is still in hospital .
A Chechen group involved in the Beslan school siege in 2004 took responsibility and its leader promised more attacks .
Nobody knows how many rebels there are in Ingushetia or neighbouring Dagestan .
Many are local and young , born when Russia first went to war in Chechnya in 1994 , says Mr Shvedov .
Russia 's brutal repression and lawlessness have pushed people towards Islamic fundamentalism .
The rebels are now driven not by ideas of independence but by revenge or the vision of an Islamist state .
Their influence has become especially visible in Ingushetia .
“ People are afraid to go out in the evening , cafés are closed , there are fire exchanges almost every night , ” says Ms Sokiryanskaya .
Mr Yevkurov , a paratrooper , inherited a corrupt and weak government from his predecessor , a KGB general named Murat Zyazikov .
His first steps were encouraging : he unearthed corruption , engaged with opposition leaders and began to fight against armed rebels .
He also insisted that Russia 's federal forces should not carry out “ special operations ” in Ingushetia without his knowledge .
But this has had little effect , says Ms Sokiryanskaya .
“ They simply do not know any other way , ” she explains .
The Kremlin likes to blame Western security services for destabilising the region .
Some Russian security men also blame Georgia 's president , Mikheil Saakashvili .
“ For as long as people like Saakashvili — the neo -Nazis and neo -Führers — lead neighbouring states , we will not be in peace , ” Arkady Yedelev , Russia 's deputy interior minister , said recently .
Russia 's large - scale “ Caucasus 2009 ” military manoeuvres were held under the banner of fighting terrorism .
Mr Medvedev , who inspected the Russian units , explicitly linked the exercises to last year 's war in Georgia .
“ The main lesson for us from these events is the necessity to hold fully fledged , ongoing and highly effective exercises , ” he said this week , a day after visiting South Ossetia , which Russia ( almost alone ) recognises as independent .
This came only a few days after Mr Obama said that America recognises Georgia 's territorial integrity and does not want a renewal of military conflict .
To ram that message home , an American warship arrived in Georgia this week to hold the first joint exercise since the end of last August 's war .
Joe Biden , America 's vice - president , is expected to visit Tbilisi shortly .
The south Caucasus remains so tense that the European Union has delayed its report into the origins of the Georgia war , which was to have been published at the end of July .
But even as the world 's attention is fixed on Georgia , Russian citizens keep dying in the north Caucasus .
Vladimir Putin , Russia 's prime minister , once promised to hang Mr Saakashvili “ by the balls ” .
Sadly he seems to have no such feeling for those who killed Ms Estemirova .

Crazy From The Heat
An overcrowded California is running out of water and leadership
By Mark Cromer
As California heads into high summer , those sweltering weeks that burn like a fever from mid-July well into September , there is no indication that our state or federal leadership has yet to truly grasp the environmental catastrophe the Golden State now faces .
Perhaps , as the saying goes , they are “ crazy from the heat . ”
Consider that less than two months ago , Sen. Dianne Feinstein took to the Senate floor and introduced a so - called farm bill — known as AgJOBS — that would legalize millions of illegal immigrant field workers and their families and , even more amazingly , set the stage to import millions more exploitable laborers to work in grueling conditions .
“ There is a farm emergency in this country , ” Feinstein said in May .
“ Some of it is caused by drought , including out West where California has had , for three years , a very serious drought .
But most of it is caused by an absence of farm labor . ”
Yet just six weeks later , detailed news reports from California ’s fertile Central Valley have confirmed that thousands of farm workers are now unemployed and driving hundreds of miles each day as they crisscross the state desperately looking for jobs in fields that are simply drying up .
A shortage of water has led to an abundance — not an absence — of cheap labor .
California ’s severe drought — a water shortage that has loomed large across the American Southwest for far more than three years — has turned farmers ’ fields into a dusty tundra that may foreshadow a West Coast dustbowl .
Ominously , hydrologists reported that this spring layers of dust coated the upper reaches of the Sierra snowpack which accelerated its rate of melt and increased the pace of runoff — leading water managers to either release water early or risk flooding .
That ’s hardly a problem based on an abundance of water arriving in our reservoirs too early , but rather the prospect of losing precious little runoff too soon .
“ It creates a high - pressured game of Twister for water managers , ” Thomas Painter , director of the Snow Optics Lab at the University of Utah , told the Los Angeles Times just two weeks after Feinstein introduced her bill .
“ They ’re having to make decisions quickly to hold on to water [ and risk flooding ] or release water . ”
Either way it is a loss — and one we cannot afford .
California ’s water supplies continue to dwindle even as its population grows , with only half of the expected runoff from the Sierra snowpack materializing in 2007 .
By last year , just as Los Angeles County closed in on 10 million people , the Sierra runoff was only 40 % of normal .
Yet as our critical water supplies in California literally evaporate before our eyes , our elected officials tout more growth , increased immigration and an expanded consumer - driven economy with all the zeal of men and women cocktailing at a Prozac party .
It is so politically incorrect to candidly assess the link between population growth ( and the runaway development it fuels ) and our water crisis that even much of academia has not only joined the party , but has actually cried for the band to play on .
Harvard economics professor Edward Glaeser unleashed his figurative pen to declare the solution to America ’s environmental problems was not less people , but more — moving to California .
Glaeser tore into the few Californian environmentalists that have dared to speak against further population growth in the face of a shrinking water supply .
“ They …emphasize that California ’s water crisis makes further expansion impossible , ” Glaeser wrote .
“ But today , the overwhelming majority of water in California is directed to farms , not people .
Using 10 % of the state ’s agricultural water for new households could address the water needs of a massive increase in state population . ”
Written like a true Harvard wonk ensconced in an ivy - covered tower that ’s safely removed from the hard realities of an overcrowded California ; its crumbling infrastructure , gridlocked traffic and bankrupt treasury .
This summer California stands at 40 million people and is on track to hit 60 million water - drinking bodies by mid-century , possibly sooner .
We have progressively less water , but we ’re growing people like there ’s no tomorrow .
There will indeed be a tomorrow .
But thanks to Sen.
Feinstein , Professor Glaeser and every other bon vivant whistling Dixie past our dry well , we may not wish it so .

When Google released its Chrome web browser for Windows , Linux and Mac OS X users were left out in the rain , without the ability to enjoy all the goodness that is Chrome .
Thanks to the relentless porting efforts of the Chromium team , we now have daily builds of the Chrome / Chromium web browser , and I decided to take a look where the Linux version stands .
Installing Chrome / Chromium is easy , but it starts with the decision which variant you want : Google ’s Chrome , or the brandless Chromium .
Chromium builds are updated daily , while Google Chrome builds are more irregular .
I opted for Google ’s Chrome , but installing either of them is as easy as 1 - 2 - 3 ; Google offers a .deb package which will not only install Chrome ( you can pick either 32 bit or 64 bit ) , but which will also add a repository so Chrome gets updated automatically .
Both Google Chrome and Chromium do not yet have Flash support enabled by default , but it ’s quite easy to enable said support with minor CLI magic ; you need to create a plugin directory in Chrome ’s directory , and then create a symbolic link to libflashplayer .
so within this directory .
sudo mkdir /opt/ google /chrome/ plugins /<br />
cd /opt/google/chrome/plugins /<br />
ln -s /usr/lib/ flashplugin-installer/libflashplayer.so
All you need to do now is add the -- enable - plugins argument to the Chrome command .
If you ’re an idiot like me , do n’t forget to add this argument to all your shortcuts , including any possible ones in your panel , or you ’ll be left wondering why the argument works from a terminal but not from the panel , and waste 10 minutes of your life trying to hunt down what ’s going on .
In any case , after all is set and done , you ’ll get the full Chrome experience on your Linux box , and I must say , the browser has made tremendous strides forward lately .
Not only has the browser become a lot less crash - prone ( no crashes yet , in fact ) , the browser itself also feels a lot snappier than the last time I tried it ( a few months ago ) .
Rendering is considerably faster , but the user interface responsiveness has also been kicked up a few notches , and the subtle animations have been improved too .
Support for themes is a very welcome addition , especially the magic button which will set Chrome to use your Gtk + theme ’s colours and icons , making Chrome feel much more like a part of your desktop .
In my case , Chrome did pick the wrong window border colour ; for some reason , it picked my highlight and icon colour ( red ) instead of my window border ’s colour ( black ) .
Also , the main Chrome window lacks the Compiz shadow , even though its dialogs do have the shadow .
A minor niggle , but annoying nonetheless .
Overall , development is continuing at a very brisk pace , and because of it , I can finally start using Linux more often again .
Ever since I switched to Chrome ( the day of the first release , actually ) , I missed Chrome dearly on other operating systems , so much even that I started using them less and less often .
With Chrome shaping up on Linux , I can finally start giving it some more time .
On a Boston radio program this morning , Bill Cosby suggested that President Obama spoke too soon on the controversial arrest of Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates .
" I 've heard about five different reports [ on the details of the arrest ] , " Cosby said on Boston 's WZLX .
" If I 'm the president of the United States , I do n't care how much pressure people want to put on it about race , I 'm keeping my mouth shut . "
" I was shocked to hear the president making this kind of statement , " Cosby said referring to the president 's remarks during last night 's press conference .
The comedian appeared to have dialed his comments back a bit in a later interview on Boston 's FOX 25 television station .
Cosby cautioned those from coming up with their own conclusions , but gave the president some leeway .
“ People who have not been there , people who do n’t know are beginning to have their own personal feelings , but they were n’t there , ” Cosby said .
“ Does this include the president ? ” asked the FOX25 reporter .
“ It includes everybody , ” Cosby said . “ [ But ]
I would have to take into consideration that he lived in Cambridge for some time so he may know more than he ’s saying about situations of that sort , ” Cosby said .

The W. Edwards Deming Institute has posted Dr. Deming ’s 1984 video on the 5 deadly diseases of western management .
Lack of constancy of purpose
Emphasis on short term profits – “ creative ” accounting , focus on quarterly profits
Annual Performance Appraisals – management by objective , management by fear
Mobility of management – [ see Toyota for a great example of a company that operates on different principles – where the leadership has been with Toyota for decades ]
Running a company on visible figures alone – many important factors are “ unknown and unknowable . ”
Dr. Deming added 2 diseases to reach his famous 7 deadly diseases : excessive medical care costs and excessive legal damage awards swelled by lawyers working on contingency fees .
Personally I believe all 7 of those diseases are still prevalent and causing damage .
I do think some progress has been made on longer term thinking but far too many organizations still are extremely short term focused .
And I would add two new deadly diseases of management : excessive executive compensation and an outdated intellectual property system .

The Wizard of Oz is a 1939 American musical - fantasy film mainly directed by Victor Fleming and based on the 1900 childrenâ€™s novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz by L. Frank Baum .
In the film , Dorothy , a schoolgirl living in Kansas , is struck unconsicious during a tornado .
She dreams about how she and her dog Toto , with the help of a Scarecrow , a Tin man and a Cowardly Lion , find their way home from the magical world of Oz .
Many people like these four characters very much : sweet Dorothy , smart Scarecrow , brave Tin man and sensetive Lion .
Many artists like them as well , and they have created various artworks featuring the four to show their fondness .
We have selected 25 of the best illustrations , which might remind you of that magical world and that famous song “ Over the Rainbow ” .

When some people think of bikers they most often think of the stereotypical of dirty , leather clad men with shaggy beards covered in road dust riding around the country wreaking havoc and getting into barroom brawls .
The truth is that most bikers are not rowdy trouble - makers and are in fact honest , law - abiding , hard working people .
However , there are small numbers of bikers who refer to themselves as “ 1%ers ” .
“ One percenter ” motorcycle gangs have been given this label because it is purported within motorcycle club circles that 99 % of all bikers live within the boundaries of the law .
Then there is the other 1 % who rejects main - stream norms and live outside of the law , often engaging in highly criminal activity .
This list takes a look at 10 American “ 1 % er ” biker gangs and highlights some of each gang ’s alleged criminal activity .
It is important to note that although some of the members of these motorcycle clubs / gangs have been arrested , tried and convicted of various crimes not every member of the following clubs engage in criminal acts .
10 Vagos
The Vagos Motorcycle Club was started in San Bernardino , CA in the 1960’s .
Members of the club often wear green and bear a patch of the Norse god Loki riding a motorcycle .
The club has approximately 24 chapters spread across the western United States in states such as Arizona and Nevada and also 3 in Mexico .
The Vagos have been the subject of several investigations by the FBI and the ATF for illegal activity such as the production and distribution of methamphetamine , murder , money laundering and weapons violations .
A highly coordinated investigation in March of 2006 led to the arrests of 25 Vagos members and their associates in what has been labeled as the largest investigation in Southern California ’s history .

9 Free Souls
This particular motorcycle gang was started in the state of Oregon in the late 1960’s .
Their patch consists of an ankh , an ancient Egyptian symbol in the shape of a cross , in the center of a motorcycle rim and tire .
All of their chapters , with the exception of one in Vancouver , Canada , are located within the state of Oregon .
On May 2 , 2007 , three members of The Free Souls Motorcycle Club were arrested and charged with various crimes .
Amongst the evidence were illegal drugs , weapons and stolen motorcycles all of which were seized as part of the investigation and arrests .
8 Bandidos
Founded in San Antonio , TX in 1966
The Bandidos are among the more notorious of American Motorcycle Clubs .
The gang ’s patch bears a cartoon - ishly obese Mexican wearing a large sombrero and carrying a machete in one hand and a pistol in the other .
The colors of gold and red were adopted as the club ’s colors due to the fact that their founder was a former Vietnam Marine veteran .
The Bandidos have around 90 chapters spread across the U.S. alone , but they have also branched out as far as Asia , Germany and Australia .
The Bandidos gang has a long and brutal history of illegal activity .
A member of The Bandidos was arrested , tried and convicted of the 2006 murder of a well known flyweight boxer and a member of the rival Hell ’s Angels Motorcycle Club was sniped while leaving a restaurant in March of that same year during The Bandidos 40th Anniversary of the clubs annual birthday celebration .
Police suspect that members of The Bandidos are responsible for the murder .
Other members have been arrested from anything from murder to drugs and illegal weapons possession as well as assault and racketeering charges .
7 Highwaymen
The Highwaymen were formed in Detroit , MI in 1954 .
Their chapters have spread across the state of Michigan as well as other U.S. states and have reached as far as Norway and England .
Their club colors are black and silver and their insignia is a winged skeleton wearing a motorcycle cap and a leather jacket .
The Highwaymen also have their own mottos which are : “ Highwaymen Forever , Forever Highwaymen ” and “ Yea , though we ride the highways in the shadows of death , we fear no evil , for we are the most evil mother fuckers on the highway . ”
Despite being the largest motorcycle club in the city of Detroit , they are not acknowledged in the Detroit Federation of Motorcycle Clubs due to their violent and criminal reputation .
In May 2007 , after a two year investigation into the gang ’s activities , the FBI raided homes and chapter clubhouses resulting in the arrests of 40 Highwaymen and associates .
The charges included insurance and mortgage frauds , murder for hire , cocaine trafficking , police corruption and racketeering .
6 Warlocks
The Warlocks were founded in 1967 in Philadelphia , PA and gained a large number of members after the end of the Vietnam War .
Consisting only of white males ,
The Warlocks have spread through the state of Pennsylvania and a good portion of the northeastern United States and also have chapters in the southeast United States as well as overseas in Germany and England .
Their club colors are red and white and they use the Greek mythological figure of a winged Harpy as their insignia .
Members often adorn themselves and their vests with white supremacy insignia as well .
In 2008 , Tommy Zaroff , a former President of the Bucks County , PA chapter was arrested on suspicion of possessing 10 pounds of methamphetamine .
In October of the same year four members of The Warlocks were arrested and charged with producing , transporting and distributing methamphetamine throughout Berks and Montgomery Counties in Pennsylvania .
It is alleged that they sold over 500 lbs. of methamphetamine worth approximately $ 9 million .
5 Sons of Silence
The Sons of Silence are another “ 1 % er ” motorcycle gang that was founded in Niwot , Colorado in 1966 and featured in a 2009 episode of Gangland on The History Channel .
Since 1966
The Sons of Silence have spread across the United States , with concentrations in the eastern U.S.
They also have several chapters spread throughout Germany .
The Sons of Silence have adopted the motto “ Donec Mors Non Seperat ” , which is Latin for “ Until Death Separates Us ” .
The club patch has been adopted from the American Eagle logo used by the Budweiser beer company and bears an eagle superimposed over the letter A with their motto underneath .
In October of 1999 , 37 members of the Sons of Silence were arrested on drug trafficking and illegal weapons charges during one of Denver ’s largest federal undercover operations .
During the raids ,
The ATF seized 20 lbs. of methamphetamine , 35 firearms , four hand grenades , 2 silencers as well as cash and motorcycles .
4 Outlaws
The Outlaw Motorcycle Club is one of the more notorious and oldest clubs on this list .
The gang started in Matilda ’s Bar on old Route 66 in McCook , IL in 1935 .
Using the insignia on Marlon Brando ’s leather jacket in The Wild One as inspiration , the club adopted the skull with cross pistons as their official club patch .
Since the club began over 70 years ago their chapters have spread widely across the United States and have been well established in Australia , Asia , Europe and North and South America .
Harry Joseph Bowman , The World Leader of The American Outlaw Association ( A.O.A. ) , was the international president of The Outlaws Motorcycle Club and presided over 30 chapters in the U.S. and 20 chapters in 4 other countries until he was sent to prison for 3 murders in 1999 after being on the F.B.I ’s Top 10 Most Wanted Fugitive list in 1998 .
Across the globe members of The Outlaws have been suspected , arrested , tried and convicted of countless crimes from prostitution , trafficking in narcotics and stolen goods , arms dealing , extortion and murder .
3 Pagans
The Pagans formed in Maryland in 1959 and by 1965 had expanded rapidly .
Their patch depicts the Norse fire giant Surtr sitting on the sun wielding a sword with the word Pagans in red , white and blue .
Members are known to wear their patches on cut - off denim jackets with accompanying white supremacist and Nazi insignia patches .
The club ’s members have also been seen with tattoos of ARGO ( Ar Go Fuck Yourself ) and NUNYA ( Nun’Ya Fuckin ’ Business ) .
Their territory seems to be confined strictly to the eastern coast in the United States .
Aside from their history of violent rivalry with the notorious Hell ’s Angels Motorcycle Club , The Pagans have been associated with numerous crimes including murder , arson , drug smuggling and have been linked to organized crime in the upper northeastern United States .
In February of 2002 , seventy - three members of The Pagans Motorcycle Club were arrested in Long Island , NY after violence erupted at a motorcycle and tattoo ball .
The Pagans allegedly went to the ball specifically to confront members of The Hell ’s Angels MC resulting in 10 wounded bikers and one murdered Pagan member .
Then in 2005 , members of The Pagans allegedly shot and killed the Vice - President of the Philadelphia Chapter of The Hell ’s Angels .
2 Mongols
The Mongols , also known as Mongol Nation or Mongol Brotherhood , were formed in 1969 in Montebello , California from Hispanic bikers who were refused entry into The Hell ’s Angels MC due to their race .
Their colors are black and white and their insignia bears the name Mongols in large black letters above a pony - tail sporting man riding a motorcycle wearing a leather vest and sunglasses while carrying a scimitar or cutlass .
Mongol chapters are concentrated in the western United States , but have also opened in Canada , Mexico and Italy .
In 2008 , the ATF coordinated a sting against The Mongols MC where 4 agents went undercover to become fully patched members while gaining intelligence about the gang ’s activities .
This operation resulted in 38 arrests including the arrest of the club ’s president , Ruben “ Doc ” Cavazos .
As part of the operation 160 search warrants were served and 110 arrest warrants were carried out .
As part of the operation , members of The Mongols MC are now prohibited by law from the use of the Mongol MC logo and insignia including wearing the patches on vests or any other garb .
1 Hell ’s Angels
Probably the most well known American biker gang , The Hell ’s Angels have a long and thorough history on American highways .
Much information concerning their origins is hazy due to their long - standing code of secrecy .
Sometime within the 1940’s or 1950 ’s in California Hell ’s Angels MC was formed .
Their insignia is the “ death ’s head ” logo which is copied from the insignia of the 85th Fighter Squadron and the 552nd Medium Bomber Squadron .
Red lettering over white backgrounds stands for the club ’s colors .
With so much popularity , Hell ’s Angels chapters have sprung up across the Untied States as well as Russia and New Zealand and the continents of North America , South America , Europe and Australia .
The Hell ’s Angels MC have gained mass notoriety in the U.S. due to their involvement in many highly publicized run-ins with the law and rival biker gangs .
The most note - worthy of publicized events happened during the Altamont Free Concert at Altamont Speedway in December of 1969 where it is alleged that The Rolling Stones hired members of The Hell ’s Angels to stand - in as bodyguards for the band .
Violence erupted in the crowd and also onto the performance stage and as a result one male was stabbed to death after brandishing a pistol .
Another publicized incident occurred in Laughlin , Nevada in Harrah ’s Casino and Hotel .
A violent confrontation in the casino between rival Mongols MC resulted in one fatally stabbed Mongol gang member and two fatally shot Hell ’s Angels members .
Those who wish to keep the internet free and open had best dust off their legal arguments .
One of America 's most influential conservative judges , Richard Posner , has proposed a ban on linking to online content without permission .
The idea , he said in a blog post last week , is to prevent aggregators and bloggers from linking to newspaper websites without paying :
Expanding copyright law to bar online access to copyrighted materials without the copyright holder 's consent , or to bar linking to or paraphrasing copyrighted materials without the copyright holder 's consent , might be necessary to keep free riding on content financed by online newspapers from so impairing the incentive to create costly news - gathering operations that news services like Reuters and the Associated Press would become the only professional , nongovernmental sources of news and opinion .
Posner 's notion set off an eruption from the likes of Jeff Jarvis , Matt Welch and Erick Schonfeld , among others .
And they are right to be furious .
Not only would Posner stop online media dead in their tracks , but he would also overturn long - established rules of fair use , which , among others things , allow for the reproduction of short excerpts of copyrighted material for the purposes of commentary , parody and the like – precisely what bloggers and aggregators do all the time .
And Posner , who sits on the seventh circuit court of appeals in Chicago , has a way of getting his way .
A brilliant , provocative thinker and a frighteningly prolific writer , he was described in a 2001 New Yorker profile as " the most mercilessly seditious legal theorist of his generation " .
And if , at 70 , Posner and his generation are not quite so influential as they once were , he is still a formidable presence on the legal scene .
In something of an irony for journalists who might be inclined to cheer Posner 's latest , it was a 2003 opinion he wrote that helped cement journalists ' modern status as cultural and social pariahs .
Posner 's decision in the case of McKevitt v Pallasch did more than any other to vanquish the idea that journalists called into court had some protection under the first amendment from having to reveal their confidential sources .
For a generation , journalists and their lawyers had relied upon the hazy wording of a 1972 supreme court case called Branzburg v Hayes , in which a bare majority ruled there was no reporter 's privilege .
One of the majority , Lewis Powell , wrote what his fellow justice Potter Stewart called " an enigmatic concurring opinion " suggesting that maybe , in some cases , there was a privilege .
As retired New York Times lawyer James Goodale explained in the Frontline documentary News Wars several years ago , media lawyers used Powell 's opinion to keep the reporter 's privilege on life support for more than 30 years until Posner , finally , pulled the plug .
As an appeals court judge , Posner could not , of course , overrule the supreme court .
In McKevitt , though , he did n't have to : he wrote that he had reread Branzburg and had come to the conclusion that , lo and behold , it meant what it said .
No more reporter 's privilege , although the states were free to create their own through shield laws and state court precedents .
( All except Wyoming have done so , many of them long before McKevitt .
And Congress may create a federal shield law later this year . )
Posner 's opinion on copyright – expressed , thankfully , in a blog post rather than a ruling from the bench – has its roots in a celebrated essay he wrote for the New York Times Book Review in 2005 called Bad News .
Although Posner was complimentary toward bloggers , and even asserted that their swarm - like verification system was superior in some ways to that of the traditional media , he nevertheless offered a few withering observations about where they get their material .
" The bloggers are parasitical on the conventional media , " Posner wrote .
" They copy the news and opinion generated by the conventional media , often at considerable expense , without picking up any of the tab .
The degree of parasitism is striking in the case of those blogs that provide their readers with links to newspaper articles .
The links enable the audience to read the articles without buying the newspaper . "
Posner comes across as willfully blind to the ways in which bloggers and aggregators actually drive traffic to news sites , resulting in more readers seeing their content and , thus , their advertising .
Yes , there are ways not to do it – the Boston Globe 's wholesale , automated aggregation of a competitor 's local content in a case settled out of court earlier this year comes to mind .
But normal linking practices benefit everyone .
The news business may be cratering , but it 's not the fault of those who link to newspaper content .
Fortunately , Posner this time can't transform his desires into a judicial decree – his proposal would have to enacted in the form of an amendment to the copyright law .
Unfortunately , such an idea is already making the rounds .
Not to go all Kevin Bacon here , but Cleveland Plain Dealer columnist Connie Schultz , who supports it , is married to Democratic senator Sherrod Brown , which led Jeff Jarvis to demand that Schultz register as a federal lobbyist .
The thing is , Congress has been known to act with great alacrity on copyright matters when they affect corporate interests .
And newspaper owners have been remarkably successful in calling attention to their plight .
But though tax breaks , special non-profit status and other federal goodies will likely go nowhere , a law aimed squarely at the linking practices of sites such as Google News and the Huffington Post would probably prove popular , the facts be damned .
It 's ominous that those would push for such a law now have an ally as brilliant and influential as Posner .
Keep a close eye on this one .
This is a speech by Tim Ryan back in 2005 .
It was pretty powerful and I had some dealings with him after this because he spoke up against the war and highlighted the insane amounts of money we were pouring into it .
Billions of dollars a month .
That was then and this is now .
I 'm sure most of us have been amazed at how disingenuous pro-life groups are when it comes to contraception .
They scream " life " is sacred , but then try to prevent all ways that are available to our society when it comes to pregnancy prevention .
We 've seen insane protests against the Plan B pill which would actually prevent unwanted pregnancies .
What many pro-lifers really want to do is control the sex lives of every American .
I know it 's hard to picture , it creeps me out just thinking about it , but the James Dobsons and Richard Lands of the religious right just want to decide when and how people can have sex .
There 's a Democratic group devoted to the pro-life movement that 's called Democrats For Life of America and Rep .
Tim Ryan learned why they are so full of shit and can never be taken seriously .
U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan ( D - Ohio ) has been , in his words , " booted " from the national advisory board of Democrats For Life of America .
The group 's mission is to elect and support pro-life Democrats ; Ryan served on the board for four years but the relationship had recently soured when he co-sponsored the " Preventing Unintended Pregnancies , Reducing the Need for Abortion and Supporting Parents Act " : Ryan said he tried to convince officials with Democrats For Life of America , which he referred to Monday as a " fringe group , " that the use of contraception is needed as part of any plan to reduce unintended pregnancies but that failed .
Kristen Day , Democrats For Life 's executive director , was ready to move on .
" DFLA gave Congressman Ryan ample opportunities to prove he 's committed to protecting life , but he has turned his back on the community at every turn . "
Ryan insists he 's still a strong pro-life advocate .
The proposed bill includes funding for comprehensive " teen pregnancy prevention " sex education and expanded coverage of " family planning " for low - income women .
" We 're working in Congress with groups that agree with preventative options while [ the DFLA ] is getting left behind , " Ryan said .
" I can't figure out for the life of me how to stop pregnancies without contraception .
Do n't be mad at me for wanting to solve the problem . "
Say goodbye , Mr. Ryan .
No sex for you .
Digby linked to this article in the NY Times from 2006 and it spells out their views on contraception .
We must never forget what they really believe .
Many Christians who are active in the evolving anti-birth - control arena state frankly that what links their efforts is a religious commitment to altering the moral landscape of the country .
In particular , and not to put too fine a point on it , they want to change the way Americans have sex .
Dr. Stanford , the F.D.A. adviser on reproductive - health drugs , proclaimed himself " fully committed to promoting an understanding of human sexuality and procreation radically at odds with the prevailing views and practices of our contemporary culture . "
Focus on the Family posts a kind of contraceptive warning label on its Web site : " Modern contraceptive inventions have given many an exaggerated sense of safety and prompted more people than ever before to move sexual expression outside the marriage boundary . "
Contraception , by this logic , encourages sexual promiscuity , sexual deviance ( like homosexuality ) and a preoccupation with sex that is unhealthful even within marriage .
This is why the " common ground " movement is such crap .
The social conservatives do n't care about " life " they care about sex .
In fact , they are the ones who are obsessed with it .
And until they can establish social and legal sanctions against other people having unapproved sex , they will not stop .
That is what moves them .
Tim Ryan says that he can't think of a way to stop unwanted pregnancies without contraception .
But that 's because he knows that human have sex regardless of whether it 's sanctioned by some busy bodies down at the corner mega-church .
These social conservatives do not accept that .
They think that sex must be controlled and that they should be the ones to control it .
Perhaps they think they need this in order to control themselves .
I 'll never forget that freak of nature Bill Frist , who embarrassed himself on THIS WEEK when he did n't know how HIV was transmitted and that condoms fail 15 % of the time .
He 's a man who backed the phony abstinence programs that was being taught to our kids .
then he self diagnosed Terri Schiavo from a video tape .
He embodies the " social conservative " sex movement .
Yuck .

State and local spending are on the rise ( annual rate , change from previous quarter ) : 2008 , First quarter 5 % 2008 , Second quarter 7.70 % 2008 , Third quarter 4.80 % 2008 , Fourth quarter - 8.30 % 2009 , First quarter - 2.60 % 2009 , Second quarter 4.80 % Source : Bureau of Economic Analysis
A huge influx of federal stimulus money to state and local governments more than offset a sharp drop in tax collections , helping to put the brakes on the nation 's economic decline , new government data show .
The stimulus funds helped reverse six months of spending declines , pushing state and local government expenditures up 4.8 % in the second quarter , reports the Bureau of Economic Analysis .
" The money has caused a very sharp change in the path of the economy , which had been in steep decline , " said Chad Stone , chief economist at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities in Washington , D.C. Federal cash is now the No. 1 revenue source for state and local governments , surpassing sales and property taxes , the government data show .
The flood of federal money lifted total revenues by 7.5 % , overcoming an 8 % drop in tax collections .
State and local governments are adding new workers andraising pay : • Employment .
State and local governments added 12,000 workers , a 0.1 % increase , in the quarter , reports the Bureau of Labor Statistics .
The private sector cut 1.3 million jobs , a 1.2 % reduction , during this time .
Federal employment was flat .
• Compensation .
Pay and benefits rose at a 4 % annual rate in the second quarter for state and local workers , BLS reports .
For private workers , compensation was up at a 0.8 % annual rate , the lowest since the government started keeping track in 1980 .
The jump in government spending — federal , state and local — was the key reason that the nation 's gross domestic product declined just 1 % in the quarter , a sharp improvement from a 6.4 % first - quarter drop .
" The stimulus is working as intended , " said Stone .
Economist Randall Pozdena said the temporary boost will hurt the economy in the long run because taxes will rise .
" The question is , are you spending money productively ? " said Pozdena , managing director of ECONorthwest , a consulting firm in Portland , Ore .
Most of the extra spending in the second quarter went for buildings , highways and other capital projects , said Donald Boyd , a senior fellow at the Rockefeller Institute of Government in Albany , N.Y .
Other state and local spending was flat , after adjusting for inflation .
The stimulus funds let states avoid cuts , rather than increase spending , Boyd said .

The battle for comprehensive healthcare does not exist between Left and Right .
The Republicans have shown themselves unwilling to negotiate in good faith , and have thus removed themselves from the debate on healthcare reform in America .
They do not have the votes or the leverage to affect the outcome , and they must now consign themselves to the sideline while the Democratic Party fights with itself .
The battle exists between the Left and Center , between those who believe a public plan is necessary to reform healthcare , and those who would appease the rabid Right and leave healthcare in the hands of private profit centers .
The Centrist 's apathy towards a public plan has done immeasurable damage to the debate .
There are few in the center who hate the idea of a socialized insurance scheme , but do n't think it necessary to bring down costs and provide more universal coverage .
Writes Conor Clark on the Daily Dish :

I have decently warm feelings about a public option , but I do n't think it 's a good site for an all - consuming pitched battle over the fate of American health - care reform .
So it 's nice to see that some members of the Obama administration think this ....
If we get over the public option , perhaps we can get back to the rest of health - care reform .

Clark provides reasoning for his position , namely that the ' signal ' argument ( whether Obama is truly a progressive or not ) " hinges only on the intensity of support for the abstract proposition
that the government should get more involved in the insurance industry . "
According to Conor , this is n't necessary for real reform , whereas increased competition and regulation are .
But Conor is missing the point .
The point is not just to bring down costs , but to create a healthcare system that values people 's health , not profit .
A public insurance scheme signals to Americans that their government gives a damn about them , that it will not leave them to the real Death Panels that decided whether people live or die according to their ability to pay .
A public insurance scheme wo n't be perfect .
It will certainly force private companies to lower costs , and it will provide relief to millions of people who have not had access to affordable care .
But above all , it will strike a blow to the insidious notion that free market capitalism should decide whether we live or die .
And for that , everyone should be lining up behind the public plan .
A focus on psychological wealth rather than financial wealth can help people get through today 's tough times , according to two of the world 's leading psychological experts on happiness .
More money makes people feel better about their lives , but it wo n't necessarily improve their quality of life , they said Saturday .
Ed Diener , PhD , of the University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign , and Robert Biswas - Diener , PhD , of the Centre for Applied Positive Psychology in Milwaukee , presented their findings at the 117th Annual Convention of the American Psychological Association on Saturday .
" People should avoid the trap of over - emphasizing financial matters and consider a complete portfolio of resources .
This will help them cope when hard times are imminent , " said Diener .
Diener also referred to a recent poll conducted by the Gallup Organization that surveyed more than 136,000 people in 132 countries from 2005 to 2006 .
The poll looked at several economic factors , such as income and the wealth of the respondents ' countries , in connection with each person 's psychological needs , such as respect , happiness , personal life evaluation and support from family and friends .
The average person in the survey was relatively happy and satisfied with his or her life .
But a larger income was more directly related to a stronger sense of happiness than with any other factor .
Overall , people who said they had a great life reported higher income , but that larger salary did not mean they felt happier on a day - to - day basis .
Diener said this may surprise some people who have long heard that money can't buy happiness .
" Money is an object that many or most people highly desire and pursue during most of their waking hours , " said Diener .
" It would be surprising if making more money had no influence whatsoever when people are asked to evaluate their lives . "
But the survey also showed that a larger income did n't necessarily contribute to a person 's day - to - day feelings of happiness , stronger social relationships or feeling of respect .
" Essentially , we have two forms of prosperity : economic and psychological , " said Diener .
" I do n't know if one is better than the other .
But what we 've found is that while money may be able to make people lead more comfortable lives , it wo n't necessarily contribute to life 's pleasant moments that come from engaging with people and activities rather than from material goods and luxuries . "
Talking about the recent financial downturn , Biswas - Diener said it's this kind of " psychological wealth " that can help people get through the worst .
Some scientifically proven coping methods include learning a new skill , meeting new people , using humor and prayer , and having supportive friends .
" Adaptation to both good and bad events is part of our psychological wealth because it helps us to move forward in life , " said Biswas - Diener .

Welcome to our Amsterdam - Expats webportal .
Our aim is to provide practical information about moving to , and living in Amsterdam , capital of The Netherlands .
Topics range from housing and education , shopping and leisure , to culture and arts .
Even health and legal issues are covered .
The information about living in Amsterdam is divided in practical subjects : Orientation , Organisation and Settled ( Please see a short description below ) .
We wish you a great stay in Amsterdam , and hope our Amsterdam - Expats website will provide all the information you 're looking for .
The Amsterdam - Expats team .
A reader recently applied for a job at Urban Outfitters , and tipped us off to a survey the company requires as part of the application process .
Did we make up a fake name and take the online questionnaire ?
Yes .

The survey has 68 questions ( all posed as statements ) and is supposed to take 20 minutes .
You 're instructed to respond on a scale , with choices like " Totally Disagree , " " Very Slightly Disagree , " " Strongly Agree " and " Totally Agree . "
But :
However loosely your moral compass is wound , it 's pretty easy to cheat this test , since with many of the questions , it 's so obvious how you should respond , if you want to get hired .
Advertisement
For instance , Question 13 :
I have problems with long hours at work .
Who in their right mind — who really wants a job — is going to admit this ?
Question 14 :
Most employees get high on the job at one time or another .
Question 41 :
Smoking a marijuana cigarette is the same as having a drink .
Question 5 :
In previous jobs I 've had problems getting to work on time , but that 's behind me now .
Question 30 :
Some people work as well slightly high as they do sober .
You know what ?
Some people do .
Some people work better high .
Are you going to say so when you want to work at Urban Outfitters ?
No .
No , you are not .

Even more amusing are the questions about stealing .
As you may know , Urban Outfitters has quite frequently been accused of ripping off other designers .
( More here , here , here , here ; and then there 's an entire site called Urban Counterfeiters . )
But there were several questions hinting that prospective employees had better not even think about stealing from UO .

Question 32 :
In some instances an employee who steals small items should be overlooked if he / she does an otherwise outstanding job .
Advertisement
Hey , I 'm gonna work super hard and only walk out of here with some earrings .
Or a purse .
Hire me ?
Question 55 :
Most employees steal at one time or another .
Psst. Everybody 's doing it .
Hire me ?
Question 44 :
A person who takes $ 5.00 a year from his / her employer is a thief .
I steal , but only a little .
Hire me ?
Question 20 :
In previous jobs I 've stolen small items , but I will never do it again .
Unless I go back on crack .
Hire me ?
It would be really interesting to see how the creative types at Urban Outfitters — who knock off T - shirts , shoes and jewelry — and whose sister company , Anthropologie , does n't like black people — would reply to these questions :
Anthropologie Does n't Care About Black People Working retail sucks ; this is a given .

Question 24 :
A company 's policies and procedures should be followed without deviation .
Question 38 :
Cheating is the way a majority of individuals succeed in business .
Question 23 :
An employee should criticize his / her company when he / she believes it to be wrong .

But maybe the answers lie here :
Question 4 :
A good employee should always support the organization when outsiders criticize it .

Question 7 :
Some rules should be altered to fit the specific situation .

Arsene Wenger has admitted there have been occasions where he has strayed from the truth .
Gunners boss admits he protected players
Connections
Arsene Wenger has admitted there have been occasions where he has strayed from the truth in a bid to protect his players .
The Arsenal manager very rarely publicly criticises members of his own squad , preferring to gloss over controversial incidents by claiming he did not see what occurred .
But the Frenchman has now confirmed that his supposed myopia is often due to the fact that he is unable to explain a player 's actions .
Asked if he had ever been economical with the truth , the Frenchman told the : " Yes , because you are thinking , ' Why has he ( a player ) done that ? ' and you know you cannot explain it .
" At times I saw it , and I said I did n't to protect the player , because I could not find any rational explanation to defend him .
" This is a job where you have to have an optimistic view of human nature or you become paranoid .
You always have to think that a guy wants to do well .
" A coach is there to help .
He must think that if he helps in the correct way the players will respond .
You can not be suspicious .
" Wenger also spoke about his long - term project at Arsenal and admitted he would have been " betraying his beliefs " if he had abandoned it to go and work for Real Madrid .
" I want to go to the end of my job here .
I built this team , I want to deliver with this team and I feel that if I left I would in some way have betrayed my beliefs , " he said .
" It is nothing to do with what Real Madrid have done .
I just could n't see leaving this team at this stage of their development . "
Wenger stressed the main objective for him is to create a coherent team , rather than to try and build a side around a handful of key individuals .
" I believe in working in our job , creating connections between the players .
I believe in what makes football great , " Wenger said .
" It is a team sport , a collective sport .
You can win because you are more a team , or because you have more individual talent .
What is interesting for me is the team ethic .
" I love the Davis Cup , but I am not a big fan of individual tennis .
It is when sport is about the team that I like it .
I like the Ryder Cup . "
This post is part of a series on face recognition , I have been posting on face recognition for a while .
There would be at least 7 - 8 more posts in the near future on the topic .
Though I can not promise a time frame within which all would be up .

3. A Huge Collection of Datasets ( Post links to a number of face image databases )
4 . Why are Support Vector Machines called so ?
This post would reference two of my posts .
One on SVMs and the other on Face Recognition using Eigenfaces .
Note :
This post focuses on the idea behind using SVMs for face recognition and authentication .
In future posts I will cover the various packages that can be used to implement SVMs and how to go about using them , and specifically for face recognition .
The same can be easily extended to other similar problems such as content based retrieval systems , speech recognition , character or signature verification systems as well .

Difference between Face Authentication ( Verification ) and Face Recognition ( also called identification ) :
This might seem like a silly thing to start with .
But for the sake of completeness ,
It is a good point to start with .
Face Authentication can be considered a subset of face recognition .
Though due to the small difference there are a few non-concurrent parts in both the systems .
Face Authentication ( also called verification ) involves a one to one check that compares an input image ( also called a query image , probe image or simply probe ) with only the image ( or class ) that the user claims to be .
In simple words , if you stand in front of a face authentication system and claim to be a certain user , the system will ONLY check if you are that user or not .
Face Recognition ( or Identification ) is another thing , though ofcourse related .
It involves a one to many comparison of the input image ( or probe or query image ) with a template library .
In simple words , in a face recognition system the input image will be compared with ALL the classes and then a decision will be made so as to identify to WHO the the input image belongs to .
Or if it does not belong to the database at all .
Like I just said before , though both Authentication and Recognition are related there are some differences in the method involved , which are obvious due to the different nature of both .

A Touch - Up of Support Vector Machines :
A few posts ago I wrote a post on why Support Vector Machines had this rather “ seemingly ” un-intuitive name .
It had a brief introduction to SVMs as well .
For those completely new to Support Vector Machines this post should help .
I ’ll still add a little for this post .
Support Vector Machine is a binary classification method that finds the optimal linear decision surface between two classes .
The decision surface is nothing but a weighted combination of the support vectors .
In other words , the support vectors decide the nature of the boundary between the two classes .
Take a look at the image below :
The SVM takes in labeled training examples , where represents the features and the class label , that could be either 1 or - 1 .
On training we obtain a set of Support Vectors , multipliers , and the term .
To understand what does , look at the above figure .
It is somewhat like the intercept term in the equation of a straight line , .
The terms and determine the orientation of the hyperplane while determines the actual position of the hyperplane .
As is indicated in the diagram , the linear decision surface is :
where
where are the support vectors .
The above holds when the data ( classes ) is linearly separable .
Sometimes however , that ’s not the case .
Take the following example :
The two classes are indicated by the two different colors .
The data is clearly not LINEARLY separable .
However when mapped onto two dimensions , a linear decision surface between them can be made with ease .
Take another example .
In this example the data is not linearly separable in 2 - D , so they are mapped onto three dimensions where a linear decision surface between the classes can be made .
By Cover ’s
Theorem it is more likely that a data - set not linearly separable in some dimension would be linearly separable in a higher dimension .
The above two examples are simple , sometimes the data might be linearly separable at very high dimensions , maybe at infinite dimensions .
But how do we realize it ?
This done by employing the beautiful Kernel Trick .
In place of the inner products we use a suitable Mercer Kernel .
I do n’t believe it is a good idea to discuss kernels here , or it will be a needless digression from face recognition .
I promise to discuss it some time later .
Thus the non-linear decision surface changes from to :
Where represents a Kernel .
It could be a Radial Basis ( Gaussian ) Kernel , A linear Kernel , A polynomial Kernel or a custom Kernel . :)
_____
Face Authentication is a two class problem .
As I have mentioned earlier , here the system is presented with a claimed identity and it has to make a decision whether the claimant is really that person or not .
The SVM in such applications will have to be fed with the images of one person , which will constitute one class and the other class will consist of images of other people other than that person .
The SVM will then generate a linear decision surface .
For a input / probe image , the identity is accepted if :
Or it is rejected .
We can parameterize the decision surface by modifying the above as :
Then , a claim will be accepted if for a probe ,
_____
Now face recognition is a class problem .
Where is the number of classes ( or individuals ) .
Whereas the traditional Support Vector Machine is a binary classifier .
So we ’ll make a few changes to the way we are representing the faces to suit our classifier .
I will come back to this in a while .
Feature Extraction :
The faces will have to be represented by some appropriate features , these could be weights obtained using the Eigenfaces method , or using gabor features or anything else .
I have written a post earlier that talked of a face recognition system based on Eigenfaces .
I would direct the reader to check face representation using Eigenfaces there .
Using Eigenfaces , each probe could be represented as a vector of weights :
After obtaining such a weight vector for the input or probe image and for all the other images stored in the library , we were simply finding the Euclidean or the Mahalanobis distance of the weight vector of the probe image with those of the images in the template library .
And then were recognizing the probe as a face that gave the minimum score provided it was below a certain threshold .
I have discussed this is much detail there .
And since I have , I would not discuss this again here .
_____
Representation in Difference Space :
SVMs are binary classifiers , that is – they give the class which might be 1 or - 1 , so we would have to modify the representation of faces a little bit than what we were doing in that previous post to make it somewhat more desirable .
In the previous approach that is “ a view based or face space approach ” , each image was encoded separately .
Here , we would change the representation and encode faces into a difference space .
The difference space takes into account the dissimilarities between faces .
In the difference space there can be two different classes .
1 . The class that encodes the dissimilarities between different images of the same person ,
2 . The other class encodes the dissimilarities between images of other people .
These two classes are then given to a SVM which then generates a decision surface .
As I wrote earlier , Face recognition traditionally can be thought of as a class problem and face authentication can be thought of as a instances two class problem .
To reduce it to a two class problem we formulate the problem into a difference space as I have already mentioned .
Now consider a training set having training images belonging to individuals .
Each individual can have more than one image , that means ofcourse .
It is from that we generate the two classes I mentioned above .
1 . The within class differences set .
This set takes into account the differences in the images of the same class or individual .
In more formal terms :
Where and are images and indicates that they belong to the same person .
This set contains the differences not just for one individual but for all individuals .
2 . The between class differences set .
This set gives the dissimilarities of different images of different individually .
In more formal terms :
Where and are images and indicates that they do not belong to the same person .
_____
Face Authentication :
For Authentication the incoming probe and a claimed identity is presented .
Using this , we first find out the similarity score :
We then accept this claim if it lies below a certain threshold or else reject it .
I have discussed the need for a threshold at the end of this post , please have a look .
is to be found heuristically .
_____
Face Recognition :
Consider a set of images , and a probe which is to be indentified .
We take and score it with every image in the set :
The image with the lowest score but below a threshold is recognized .
I have written at the end of this post explaining why this threshold is important .
This threshold is mostly chose heuristically .

Jerry was n't the sort of guy who would normally vent frustration out loud at work , yet here he was - cursing into the air at two individuals in particular - the first round of explitives being directed at the toolbag , somewhere , who had botched months of server backups by reusing the same set of tapes for months and the other being a long ago departed developer whose name he was continually being subjected to in the comments of the rotten shell script he was now stepping through .
What had started out as a 7:30 am ticket from an early - bird user getting a error message when trying to open a spreadsheet test plan from the week before had turned into a full - on , corporate - wide DEFCON 1 .
To make matters worse , Jerry had just delivered his two - week notice a few days prior which meant that in every meeting Jerry was getting " thanked " for the company 's current nuclear crisis and that he should have set his little " time bomb " to go off AFTER he was gone .
Naturally , while his being " blamed " helped to improve the morale of everyone else , it did n't do much to help Jerry 's outlook - especially since it appeared as if this was someone else 's " parting gift " .
Questions ?
Please Refer to the Scriptonomicon
For as long as anyone could remember , everyone just kind of just coped with the Bourne shell script that was the framework to a test environment .
It was originally designed to run automated tests for a single product , but management was so thrilled at how well it worked that they got other projects to adapt the framework .
Over the next few years , it became the de-facto test framework used by applications throughout the corporation .
However , in order to make " one size fit all " , it had morphed into something ... different .
It became one of those gnarly applications that everybody acknowledged was a bit sketchy behind the scenes , but it worked .
So long as you stuck to the S.O.P. and knew the different locations where the same value had to be defined and accepted that P_OPERATOR_ID was a unique network identifier that is NOT a normal network ID that you had to get from Chuck in the Infrastructure Group , you 'd be ok .
However , recently , the developer who had originally created the framework had left the company in search of greener pastures and , rather than handing off the task of running the scripts to a developer , it was given to a co-op student .
After all , running the script was like checking off steps on a list , right ?
The co-op set up the configuration , scheduled it to run over the weekend , and merrily left it to return the following week .
As it turned out , he missed a few details .
Cleaning Up
From a high level , the Bourne script would essentially ssh into each target machine , do its thing , and then exit .
As part of its " thing " , the designer of the framework wanted to make sure the script cleaned up after itself so subsequent runs of the framework would not re-process old data .
To accomplish this , one of the enhancements after the initial release was to add two cryptic variables that ( redundantly ) contained the project name and the version being tested .
Utilizing an unpatched flaw in sudo 's setup to gain real root access , the script would then do the following as part of the clean up :
rm - rf $ var1/$var2
Ordinarily , this worked just fine , but the co-op student was unaware these SPECIFIC variables needed to be set .
With them being left blank , the following was the end result upon execution of the script :
rm - rf /
With the script running as root on a setup with NFS ( which , in turn , granted access to everything on the entire UNIX / Linux network and a few Windows Servers via SAMBA ) , the script had a chance to do a good bit of damage ... and it did .
Home directories , file repositories , customer data , test results , all seemingly evaporated into nothingness .
All told , it took 6 hours to wipe out the entire network .
It took 4 hours to figure out what happened ( turns out the script ssh'd onto its own server and the rm - rf wiped out the scripts which did the rm - rf and most the evidence of what happened ) and it only took 10 seconds to realize that the latest backups were completely SNAFU'd .
So , as his parting gift , while the most critical drives were being sent off for possible forensic recovery , Jerry was asked to review the test framework and look for any possible flaws where something similar could re-occur .
After hitting the 10th instance where deviating from the normal routine would result in some degree of disaster , Jerry knew one thing - even though he had less than two weeks to go , this is one script that would be haunting his nightmares for a long time to come .
The decision by the high court yesterday not to prevent the extradition of Gary McKinnon is disappointing yet sadly not surprising .
The problem is not that the courts are making bad decisions but that we have a bad law that removes important safeguards and largely ties the hands of our judges .
The Extradition Act 2003 , enacted after 9/11 for the express intention of fast - tracking extradition , removed many fundamental safeguards that traditionally formed part of the extradition process .
These safeguards were built up over time to guard against the real risk that someone could be sent to a country on the basis of politically motivated charges or on the flimsiest of evidence .
As has been shown in Gary McKinnon 's case , the 2003 act makes no provision for a court to bar extradition even if the UK would be the most appropriate forum in which to prosecute .
The act also removes the requirement to make out a basic case against a person before they can be extradited in respect of over 50 countries , including the US .
It also dispensed with the requirement of dual criminality for certain offences for extradition within Europe .
When these safeguards were whittled away in 2003 many believed this was a necessary consequence of the " war on terror " .
Few would have thought it would apply to computer hackers with Aspergers , searching for UFOs or – as we have also recently seen – to a young student extradited on the basis of deeply flawed evidence .
It is , after all , always easier to trade away the rights of others .
But in truth fast - track extradition could apply to any one of us .
Liberty certainly does not argue there is no need for extradition : fugitives from justice should not be afforded blanket protection from prosecution .
However , as with all aspects of the criminal justice process , there is a need for safeguards to ensure that injustice is not committed in the name of expediency .
Extradition is a trauma in and of itself .
It involves forcible removal to a foreign country away from family , friends and legal advisors .
You may not know the language or legal system and you almost inevitably face imprisonment pending trial because being a foreigner ensures you are considered a flight risk .
Gary McKinnon is likely to face pre-trial imprisonment and a long jail sentence if found guilty .
Many argue " do n't do the crime if you can't do the time " but Gary McKinnon was sitting in his home in North London using his mother 's computer and our parliament has not imposed such severe sanctions for the conduct alleged .
This does not mean he should avoid prosecution altogether , but it does raise the question as to where is the most appropriate place for him to be tried .
Arguably it is in the UK – all of the actions constituting the alleged offence took place here .
In these circumstances Liberty believes a UK court should be given the opportunity to bar extradition if it would be in the interests of justice to do so .
In fact in 2006 our parliament passed legislation that would allow a court to do just that – but neither the government nor our parliamentarians have yet brought this into force .
If it had been when the court initially considered Gary McKinnon 's case it is likely that his extradition would have been refused .
This tragic case highlights the urgent need for this provision .
Earlier this year Liberty suggested an amendment ( pdf ) to a bill currently before parliament which would do just that .
The amendment has now been laid by the Conservatives in the House of Lords .
When parliamentarians return from their summer break we hope that they will support this amendment and stand up for future Gary McKinnons by giving our courts the discretion to refuse extradition when the public interest so clearly would n't be served .
NCIS : Los Angeles - NCIS : LOS ANGELES is a drama about the high stakes world of undercover surveillance at the Office of Special Projects ( OSP ) , a division of NCIS that is charged with apprehending dangerous and elusive criminals that pose a threat to the nation 's security .
By assuming false identities and utilizing the most advanced technology , this team of highly trained agents goes deep undercover , putting their lives on the line in the field to bring down their targets .
Special Agent " G " Callen ( Chris O'Donnell ) is a chameleon who transforms himself into whomever he needs to be to infiltrate the criminal underworld .
His partner is Special Agent Sam Hanna ( LL COOL J ) , a former U.S. Navy SEAL who has seen action in both Afghanistan and Iraq , and a surveillance expert who uses state of the art monitoring equipment to look out for those in the field and feed them crucial information .
Both Callen and Hanna report to Special Agent Lara Macy ( Louise Lombard ) , the OSP team leader responsible for directing the operations and making life - or - death decisions .
Assisting the team is Special Agent Kensi Lo ( Daniela Ruah ) , the exceptionally bright daughter of a slain Marine who lives for the adrenalin rush that comes with undercover work , and Operational Psychologist Nate Getz ( Peter Cambor ) , adept at getting into anybody 's head , profiling the target and monitoring agents ' states of mind before , during and after missions .
Armed with the latest in high tech gear and sent regularly into life - threatening situations , this tight - knit team relies on each other to do what is necessary to protect national interests .
Shane Brennan ( NCIS ) is the executive producer for CBS Television Studios .
Among the series picked up by CBS and included on their fall 2009 lineup is .
Not to be confused by the original and still chugging along , .
Set to air on Tuesday nights , the drama series will follow the world of undercover surveillance at the Office of Special Projects based in L.A.
Below is CBS ’ description for the series :
Are you thinking the same thing I am ?
Chris O’Donnell and LL Cool J are finally working together !
Ok , maybe not but as both of them were on my list of major crushes back in the ‘ 90 ’s , it is pretty cool that they ’re both starring in this new series .
As there ’s a pretty sizable audience for the original , I ’m sure there are plenty of people planning to check this show out along with all the LL and O’Donnell fans out there .
br>will air Tuesdays on CBS ( 9 - 10 p.m. ET ) starting fall 2009 .
Welcome to the latest update !
I spent a total of about an hour on the “ Social Code Sharing ” application in the 2nd edition of “ Practical Django Projects ” , and I ’m not completely finished with it , but I ’ve got syntax highlighting and the basics covered .
I can add , edit , and delete snippets , list snippets , and show a particular snippet , complete with syntax highlighting .
In an hour .
That ’s pretty ok , considering I spent a lot of that time debugging what I would call , at best , an unexplained inconsistency in the book that caused me to run into a series of errors before finally figuring out the right way to do it ( it ’ll all be in the book review – stay tuned for that ) .
I do n’t have links or user contribution set up yet .
I only have a quick example up right now , which you can see here , which brings me to the design question : I want my navigation sidebar on the right , but I really do n’t want the code to overlap it in any way .
I ’m kinda wondering if there ’s an elegant way to fix that .
I considered moving the sidebar to the left , but did n’t want to do that .
I considered just making the main content area bigger , but then I ’m just guessing , and praying that it fixes the problem for all future code snippets .
What ’s there now is just a CSS - based solution that creates a scrollable area for the code if it ’s too long .
Maybe this will suffice ( though I have some CSSing to do to refine what ’s currently there — the entire content area scrolls right now ! )
Since there ’s no example template for dealing with code highlighting in the book , and the downloadable code only goes through the first app in the book ( the CMS app ) , here ’s the template I ’m using for the snippet_detail .hml file :
{ % block title %}{{block .super}} | Random hacks{ % endblock %} { % block extrahead %} < link rel= " stylesheet " type =" text/css " href= " / static_media/llo_main/css/pygments.css " /> { % endblock %} { % block content %} < ul > < li>{{ object.
title }}</li > < li>Published : {{ object.pub_date }} Updated : {{ object.updated_date }}</li > < li>Language : {{ object.language }}</li > < li>Author : {{ object.author }}</li > { % load markup %} < li>Description : {{ object.description_html|markdown }}</li> </ul > < p > {{ object.highlighted_code|markdown }} { % endblock %}
Your CSS path will be different , in all likelihood , and there are some touches missing , like use of a variable to make the title bar dynamic and stuff , but right now I ’m shooting for function — the form will come later .
For the snippet_list .
html file , I found that what ’s in the book just does n’t work at all .
It uses pagination using Django ’s built - in pagination capabilities , but the small subset of a template that ’s provided references a {{ page }} variable , which does nothing .
The Paginator class appears to make individual pages available to templates in a variable you ’d reference as {{ page_obj }} , not {{ page }} .
Referencing {{ page_obj }} by itself ( without referencing any attribute of it ) results in output that says something like “ < Page 1 of 1 > ” .
It ’s not necessarily pretty to have those “ < > ” around the edges of the output , and it ’s not necessary to use this method of getting the page number and the page count .
The page number is available as an attribute of the page class , and the total number of pages is available from the associated paginator object ’s ‘ num_pages ’ method , which you can grab via {{ page_obj.paginator.num_pages }} .
You can see my snippets_list .
html output here , and here ’s my template ( at time of writing – note that my site is a work in progress and can change without warning ) :
{ % block content %} < p > Page {{ page_obj.number }} of {{ page_obj.paginator.num_pages
}}</p> < p > { % if page_obj.has_previous %} < a href= " ?page={{page_obj.previous_page_number}} " >Previous page </a> { % endif %} { % if page_obj.has_next_page %} < a href= " ?page={{ page_obj.next_page_number }} " >
Next page </a> { % endif %}</p> { % for snippet in object_list %} < ul > < li >< a href= " {{snippet.get_absolute_url}} " > Title : {{ snippet .
title }}</a></li>
< li>Published : {{ snippet .
pub_date }} Updated : {{ snippet.updated_date }}</li > < li>Language : {{ snippet.language }}</li > < li>Author : {{ snippet.author }}</li > < li>Description : {{ snippet.description_html }}</li > </ul > { % endfor %} { % endblock %}
In the interest of full disclosure , I should also say that , at time of writing , I have n’t added enough snippets to fully test the previous and next page links .
I ’ll get there , I ’m sure — especially when I get user contributions in place , which will happen when I feel a little more confident that this is going to happen in a secure manner .
Having been to PHP land , it ’s a little unnatural for me to trust the code that comes with a framework to do things properly , which my sysadmin brain always parses as “ securely , and in a functionally correct manner ” .
Please share tips in the comments !

Update
As the story goes , a Kotaku reader just received these PS3 posters ( now posted after the break ) into the FYE shop where he works .
You 'll notice that the " new low price " is augmented with a " while supplies last " disclaimer indicating what could be a close - out on the 80GB ( soon $ 300 , reduced from $ 400 ) and 160 GB ( $ 400 , reduced from $ 500 ) PlayStation 3 models .
More evidence , perhaps , that a PS3 Slim announcement is imminent -- even as soon as today 's Sony presser at the Cologne Gamescom Expo that kicks off at 12 noon ET or 1800 for those of you on Central Europe time . :
Kmart is now in on the action with a front - page ad ( pictured above ) that says the " rumors are reality " and then promises linked details about " new low price and a new exciting Playstation 3 . "
Unfortunately , the link is n't populated with the new prices or the new model yet but we 'll keep digging .

TEHRAN ( Reuters ) - Iranian opposition leader Mirhossein Mousavi urged supporters to continue protests over the re-election of hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , in a direct challenge to the Islamic Republic ’s leadership .
EDITORS ’ NOTE : Reuters and other foreign media are subject to Iranian restrictions on their ability to report , film or take pictures in Tehran .
Mousavi made a veiled appeal to the security forces to show restraint in handling demonstrations -- a move likely to be viewed with deep suspicion by a conservative leadership that has vowed to use force wherever necessary to quell opposition .
Helicopters buzzed through the evening sky over Tehran and gunfire was heard in the north of the city , a bastion of support for the reformist former prime minister .
“ Protesting against lies and fraud ( in the election ) is your right , ” Mousavi , who came a distant second to Ahmadinejad in the poll , said in a statement on his website on Sunday .
“ In your protests , continue to show restraint .
I am expecting armed forces to avoid irreversible damage , ” he added .
Iranian state television said 10 people were killed and more than 100 others injured in protests in Tehran on Saturday held in defiance of a warning from Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .
A separate report put the number of deaths at 13 .
Mousavi said the mass arrest of his supporters “ will create a rift between society and the country ’s armed forces . ”
A product of the Islamic establishment himself , Mousavi said on Saturday he was not questioning the fundaments of the Islamic Republic but sought to renew it and purge it of what he called deceit and lies .
The June 12 election which returned the anti-Western Ahmadinejad to power has sparked the most violent unrest since the 1979 Islamic Revolution which ousted the U.S. - backed shah .
The authorities have branded the protesters as “ terrorists ” and rioters .
Tehran ’s police commander Azizullah Rajabzadeh warned police would “ confront all gatherings and unrest with all its strength , ” the official IRNA news agency reported .
U.S. President Barack Obama , in the forefront of diplomatic efforts to halt an Iranian nuclear program the West fears could yield atomic weapons , has urged Iran to stop violence against protestors .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the authorities should conduct a recount .
Ahmadinejad has rejected such calls as western interference .

The tensions in Iran , a major gas and oil producer , assumed broader significance on Sunday with Jean - Claude Trichet , president of the European Central Bank , telling French radio they had added to risks facing the world economy and underlined the need for strengthening the global financial system .
GUNFIRE AND CHANTS
In pro-Mousavi districts of northern Tehran , supporters took to the rooftops after dusk to chant their defiance , witnesses said , an echo of tactics used in the 1979 Islamic revolution .
Slideshow ( 23 images )
“ I heard repeated shootings while people were chanting Allahu Akbar ( God is greatest ) in Niavaran area , ” said a witness , who asked not to be named .
There were no immediate reports of casualties and the shooting appeared an attempt to break up unsanctioned protests .
Government restrictions prevent correspondents working for foreign media from attending protests to report .
Iran ordered BBC correspondent , Jon Leyne , out of the country .
Pro-reform clerics meanwhile increased pressure on Iran ’s conservative leadership .
Mohammad Khatami , a Mousavi ally and a moderate former president , warned of “ dangerous consequences ” if the people were prevented from expressing their demands in peaceful ways .
His comments , carried by the semi-official Mehr news agency , were implicit criticism of Khamenei , who has backed a ban on protests and defended the outcome of the election .
An analysis of official statistics from Iran ’s Interior Ministry by Britain ’s Chatham House think - tank suggested that in the conservative Mazandaran and Yazd provinces , turnout was more than 100 percent .
It said that in a third of all provinces , official results would have required Ahmadinejad to take all former conservative , centrist and all new voters , and up to 44 percent of reformist voters , “ despite a decade of conflict between these two groups . ”
The authorities reject charges of election fraud .
But the highest legislative body has said it is ready to recount a random 10 percent of votes cast .
Since it was introduced in February , Representative Ron Paul 's " Audit the Fed " bill ( H.R. 1207 ) has gained 282 congressional cosponsors .
If adopted , the bill would allow the Government Accountability Office to review , not only the Federal Reserve 's balance sheet , but its recent monetary policy deliberations and transactions .
Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke opposes the plan , saying it would undermine the Fed 's hallowed independence .
But Mr. Paul , a noted libertarian who ran for president last year , also wants to keep the Fed out of Congress 's clutches – by scrapping it altogether .
That 's the goal of his follow - up Federal Reserve Board Abolition Act ( H.R. 833 ) .
Although that measure has yet to gain a single cosponsor , it has plenty of grass - roots support , and Paul hopes that members of Congress will jump on the bandwagon once their eyes are opened by a no-holds - barred audit .
Wacky stuff ?
Well , if not having a ghost of a chance is enough to make a bill bonkers , Paul 's measure probably qualifies .
But that does n't mean you 've got to be crazy to believe that the US economy would be better off without the Fed .
The Fed 's apologists suggest otherwise , of course .
They note that the US spent nearly half the years between 1854 to 1913 in recession , as opposed to just 21 percent of the time since the Fed 's establishment in 1913 .
Who would want to go back to those bad old days ?
But consider : the US economy has actually grown less rapidly since 1914 than it did before .
And inflation has been much worse , despite both the Civil War , which featured the nation 's worst inflation , and the Great Depression , which featured its severest deflation !
What 's more , the frequent downturns before 1914 were due , not to the lack of a central bank , but to foolish government regulations .
Topping the list were bans on branch banking , initiated by state governments and then incorporated into federal banking law .
The bans propped up thousands of undercapitalized and under - diversified banks – banks unfit to survive major local shocks , let alone macroeconomics ones .
They also caused bank notes – competitively supplied counterparts of today 's Federal Reserve notes – to trade at discounts whenever they traveled far from the solitary offices of banks that issued them .
During the Civil War , state bank notes were taxed out of existence to make way for those of new national banks .
Because national banks had to accept one another 's notes at full value , their currency was uniform .
But national bank notes had to be backed by government bonds .
That requirement , designed to bolster the Union 's finances while the war raged on , proved disastrous afterward , when government surpluses led to a halving of the federal debt , and to a corresponding shortage of bonds for securing bank notes .
The resulting currency panics – in 1873 , 1884 , 1893 , and 1907 – prompted the Fed 's establishment .
But they did n't have to .
Until 1907 , prominent reformers favored simply abolishing Civil War-era restrictions on banks ' freedom to issue notes and allowing all banks to branch nationwide to ease the mopping - up of unwanted paper money .
They drew inspiration from Canada , where a similar " asset currency " arrangement had been working smoothly for decades .
Between the panic of 1893 and that of 1907 , Congress considered more than a dozen " asset currency " measures
But none got anywhere , thanks to local bankers ' determination to block any proposal for branch banking that would threaten their cozy monopolies .
It was only once these deregulatory efforts failed that reformers fell back on the plan of establishing a " central reserve bank . "
The resulting Federal Reserve Act was , in essence , merely a plan to allow 12 new banks to do what other banks were prevented from doing themselves , namely , establish branch networks and issue currency backed by commercial assets .
But the Federal Reserve plan proved to be a poor substitute for deregulation .
By granting monopoly privileges to the Federal Reserve banks , it allowed them to inflate recklessly :
By 1919 , the US inflation rate , which had cleaved close to zero ever since the Civil War , was close to 20 percent !
Yet the Fed was also capable of failing to supply enough money to avert crises .
The first downturn over which it presided – that of 1921 – was among the sharpest in US history .
Still it was nothing compared to the unprecedented monetary contraction of 1929 - 1933 .
Would asset currency have been any better ?
Canada 's was : Between 1929 and 1933 , for instance , 6,000 US banks failed , and a third of the US money stock was wiped out .
In contrast , and despite a fixed Canadian - US dollar exchange rate , Canada 's money stock shrank by just 13 percent , and no Canadian bank failed .
Notwithstanding this superior outcome , the Canadian government itself abandoned asset currency in favor of central banking in 1935 , to placate a growing Canadian movement for easy money .
So a call to end the Fed would have been anything but crazy in 1934 .
Three - quarters of a century and a dozen crises later , there are plenty of grounds for insisting that it has n't gotten any crazier .

Introduction
Hashing normally makes people think of cryptographic hashing often used to store passwords .
Understandable considering this is what users might more familiar with .
However , the principles of hashing are used for more than simply preventing retrieval of certain data .
What I 'm referring to is hashing for the purposes of efficient data referencing .
This is better known to developers rather than users .
Big-O
Let me explain a bit about how efficiency is measured .
Algorithm analysts use what we call Big - O notation .
In simple terms it represents the worst case runtime taken to process data of size N and the trends that the algorithm exhibits as N gets larger .
It is notated by O(x ) where x is the ' order of ' the algorithm in terms of the above definition .
The order of an algorithm is the type of growth rate over time required to complete execution as the volume of input data increases .
For example , any algorithm which takes the same time regardless of how much data it is required to process we notate this as O ( 1 ) .
Code - wise , an O ( 1 ) statement is generally a very simple one , such as :
int i = 5 ;
For an algorithm which takes the same time to process per element of data , that is to say that if we say T ( time ) is directly proportional to N , where N is the size of the input data , we can say it has O ( N ) efficiency .
A code example demonstrating this order is often :
for ( i = 0 ; i < N ; i ++ ) { puts ( " . " ) ; }
As you can see , it executes the puts ( ) function N times and so has a run-time efficiency of O ( N ) .
Let 's take one last example .
for ( i = 0 ; i < N ; i ++ ) { for ( j = 0 ; j < N ; j ++ ) { puts ( " . " ) ; } }
In this example we see that there are two nested loops , and it will call puts ( ) NÂ² times , and so is considered O ( NÂ² ) .
I 'm not going to go into any more detail about this , so long as you understand basically what big - O notation is and that the slower the graph of the growth rate ( the order ) is , the more ' efficient ' the code is considered .
For more information on Big - O notation check out the wikipedia article on the subject
Primitive data structures
Now let 's consider how we can handle a variable N element list of data , and things we might want to do to that data .
There are two commonly useful models of organising .
There are
Arrays ( sequential lists )
Linked - lists ( non sequential lists )
Arrays are allocated in one lump in memory and are accessed by the program by memory offsets .
Consider this block of memory .
In C , if you wanted to get the value at offset 5 then set it with another , we simply do the following :
int value = offset [ 5 ] ; // retrieve the value offset [ 5 ] = 111 ; // set a new value
Simple enough right ?
This is obviously of the order , O ( 1 ) for both read and write operations .
How about if we did n't really know the offset a value we 're after is at ?
Consider an array which contains multiple pieces of data , such as an object or a struct ( C structure ) might .
Let 's say we have this structure :
struct country_code { char * code ; char * name ; } ;
Say this is our new array :
This can be initialised as follows :
struct country_code codes [ ] = { { " au " , " Australia " } , { " de " , " Germany " } , { " uk " , " United Kingdom " } , { " fr " , " France " } } ;
Now imagine you wanted to figure out what country ' de ' stood for .
This is how you 'd need to accomplish it :
# define N 4 int i ; for ( i = 0 ; i < N ; i ++ ) { if ( strcmp ( codes [ i ] . code , " de " ) == 0 ) { printf ( " The country is ' %s '
" , codes [ i ] . name ) ; } }
You can see here that this algorithm is of O ( N ) .
N here is the length of our array which in this case we already knew to be 4 .
So to read or to write to any element in our new array based on the country code to locate the structure we have lost efficiency from our original approach of directly accessing memory locations .
On to hashing
You can see here that this algorithm is of O ( N ) .
N here is the length of our array which in this case we already knew to be 4 .
So to read or to write to any element in our new array based on the country code to locate the structure we have lost efficiency from our original approach of directly accessing memory locations .
# define N 10 int hash_code = 7362138 ; int index = hash_code % N ;
The hash code production function is allowed to return negatives if the hash algorithm is designed in such a way to permit that , we should always take the positive form .
In C we can use the abs ( ) function to ensure our hash code is positive .
int index = abs ( hash_code ) % N ;
For the remainder of this article the array we 're managing with hashing will be referred to as a hash table and an array element will be referred to as a " bucket " .
Collisions
An observant reader will notice straight away , that this is going to be highly prone to collisions for different keys .
What if hash code was 326438 or - 318 ?
When either of these are integer - divided by 10 , returning the remainder they will produce 8 .
Hashing algorithms , like password hashing , are often non-injective .
Due to constraints of a finite memory and a limited hash table width ( the size of the table ) , it is very likely that you will end up with a " collision " where two different inputs produce the same output .
So computer scientists and mathematicians decide not to care too much about creating a true injective hash function .
Collisions become more frequent as the hash table size is reduced and if we blindly ignore the possibility of a collision we can accident overwrite an element of the hash table array .
To resolve collisions we take a few steps to make them harder to produce and if we get a collision then we resolve it in an efficient and safe way .
First off we attempt to make our hash ( ) function produce results more uniformly distributed over the output range .
This means that for every possible input key the probability of a particular output hash are equal to every other possible input key .
So if we knew our keys were only ever going to be n characters in length ( such as ID codes for employees , or car registration numbers ) , then we try to distribute the hash codes of the keys evenly over the output range .
Knowing the that the keys will be fixed length makes building a hash function that much easier .
Unfortunately most useful hashing needs to make use of variable length keys .
We should also take a prime number as the size of our array , hopefully reducing the number of common factors the hash code has for n although there is some debate over whether we should keep our table width as a prime number or whether we should use table widths that are powers of 2 and use bit logic to calculate keys rather than modulo .
This argument comes about because of the speed of modulo can be rather slow when given lots of hash keys to calculate .
In a previous example I showed how to calculate a key using the modulus operator this should be used if the width of a hash table is a prime .
For completeness if you choose to implement hash tables whose widths are a power of 2 then you can do the following :
int hash_code = 7362138 ; int width = 8 ; int mask = width - 1 ; int index = hash_code & mask ; // index will become 2
This is considerably faster than the modulus method but will result in greater possible frequency of collisions .
Given that our hash function produces codes of equal probability and if we choose to implement our hash table widths as prime numbers then we have reduced the likelihood of collisions , but not prevented them .
In fact , its impractical to prevent collisions , instead we design a way to handle them .
This takes two forms .
Chained hashing and Open Addressing .
Chained Hashing
With chained hashing each bucket of our hash table ( the array where our actual data is stored in ) we consider to be a linked list .
When inserting new data into the hash table we simply look at the resulting index .
If it is null ( I.e. there is no list here ) we create a list item and insert it at that index .
If it is not null we iterate through the linked list until we find the end , then link our data value on the end .
Retrieval from a hash table using this collision resolution technique requires that the original hash keys themselves are stored along with the data values .
A retrieval operation will first find the elements index using the hash code , then iterate through the linked list and evaluates whether the stored key within each list item is equal to our search key .
Let M be the length of our hash table and N be the number of elements within the table .
If our hash function is uniformly distributed then the average length of our linked lists will be N/M .
This is called the load factor .
So our search efficiency will become O ( N / M ) .
Since we will never know for sure what keys are being used it is improbable but possible for all of the elements to end up in the same bucket attached on the same list .
If this occurs then our search efficiency is back to where we started at O ( N ) .
This is precisely why the choice of hash function is crucial .
Since we are trying to improve things we introduced the concept of load factors .
The load factor of a chained hash table is the theoretical average length of each list .
If our hash function produces uniformly distributed hash codes then our load factor should always be N/M .
We decide on a reasonable threshold load factor , say 1 , and when our load factor is reached we create a new table , approximately twice the size and rehash all the elements .
If you are using a prime number as the table width then you will need to generate a new prime number , this adds a small overhead on the resize and rehashing operation .
If you are using a table width that is a power of 2 then this will simply be a case of doubling the existing size with no extra overhead .
Resizing and rehashing will reduce the current load factor to 0.5 because M has doubled .
The factor by which the table size increases by is implementation specific , but should result in the length of the table being at least approximately double .
The load factor of this will always range between our minimal load factor ( in the above implementation description this would be approximately 0.5 ) to our threshold load factor ( in the above example this was 1.0 ) .
As a rule low load factors result in too much memory not being used ( but items being retrieved faster ) and high load factors indicate the risk of long bucket chains which reduces the efficiency of collision resolution .
A lot of sources recommend an optimal load factor is approximately 0.7 .
To demonstrate why this is important let 's look at the resulting hash table using a table width of 7 with 10 items .
The load factor for this is ~ 1.429 .
As you can see the hash table is overloaded , with all but one index 's containing values and 3 of those indexes containing one or more collisions .
Now if we set M to be approximately 2N to the nearest prime , let 's say 17 our hash table will look more like this .
There are now 8 empty indexes and only one collision .
The load is now ~ 0.588 .
Open Addressing
The second way to resolve solutions is called Open Addressing .
Instead of appending elements to a list at the index calculated from the hash functions result we simply insert our elements elsewhere if a particular index is already occupied .
The way in which we locate where to insert the element depends on some collision resolution algorithm .
This algorithm is used to retrieve items that are not found at their calculated index as well .
With chained hashing we also monitor the load factor and at a particular threshold we once again create a new table and rehash all the elements .
Linear probing
Linear probing is the simplest open addressing locator algorithm .
To insert an item we take our resulting " natural " index ( often called the home address ) produced by the hashing function scaled down by the table width and if its occupied by an element with a different key we move linearly over the table picking the next bucket to investigate by some fixed offset .
For ease of explanation , for now let 's just assume we move up by one element at a time starting from the home address .
When we reach the end of the array we wrap around and begin at the start .
We do this until we find an unoccupied index , then we insert the data element here .
If we never find an unoccupied index then the hash table is full and no further items can be added .
In a good implementation of open addressed hashing this should never happen because the table should be resized and rehashed after surpassing a load factor threshold .
The same process is used later to find the original item by beginning at the home address and iterating over the array , checking the keys of every element as it goes .
If it reaches an unoccupied index or has visited every element of the table then the item does n't exist .
To remove an item we overwrite the item in a bucket with a unique identifier to label the element as removed .
We do this instead of deleting the item completely because if we did then the linear probing would find the empty index and assume it had found the first available unoccupied index already and that the element it is searching for does not exist when actually there could be elements with the same hash code further down the list after the removed item .
A length of continuous items is called a cluster .
When several different keys hash to a near but not identical home address they contribute to the length of the cluster which makes the search time for any element whose home address exists within the cluster longer .
To demonstrate clusters let 's look at a diagram that contains a combined - cluster , imagine the following hash table .
Each item contains its key and for demonstration purposes its home address too .
The last bucket there is unoccupied .
We do n't really care about the key .
What I wish to show you here is that the home address of an element in a bucket can be mixed .
Here we see 4 different home addresses merged into one cluster of items .
So if we were looking to find the item with the key " Seven " our home address is calculated to be 0x03 but 0x03 is occupied by an item with the key " Four " .
So we work rightwards checking each key until we find " Seven " .
As more and more items are added to the table and the load factor increases clustering becomes a serious performance issue .
There is also an example in that diagram of cluster collisions .
The element with the key " Six " could have been the first item inserted into the table and the others afterwards .
The clusters then over time have merged together ( called colliding ) .
If a very long cluster at 0x05 had developed before our cluster starting at 0x00 had became long enough to merge with it then when the two clusters do eventually merge the number of operations required to insert an item with the home address of 0x00 would become the length of both clusters combined together .
Avoiding clustering tends to be handled from two angles .
The first is to alter the hashing function to produce hashes at intervals further away from one another .
This gives a little room for clusters to expand before becoming a problem but as a result in order to implement this sections of memory are considered redundant buffers between clusters .
This leads to greater memory consumption .
Non-Linear probing
The second angle this can be tackled from is called non-linear probing .
I 'm not going to go into detail on this but the jist is that instead of checking each index consecutively you probe in a larger non-linear offset .
For instance you could probe in intervals of 1Â² , 2Â² , 3Â² , etc or using triangular intervals such as 1 , 1+2 , 1+2+3 , etc .
These approaches are called quadratic and triangular probing respectively and apply to the insert , search and removal operations in place of a fixed increment .
These approaches only work if the hash table width is a prime and the load factor is below 0.5 .
Otherwise it becomes possible that an unoccupied location will never be found .
This avoids the clustering effect described above but now suffers from a different form of clustering whereby items with the same home address still probe the same sequence of bucket locations .
This second form of clustering can be avoided by using a technique called double hashing .
Double hashing uses the hash code in addition to calculating the home address to calculate an offset from the home address .
An example of how this might be calculated in C :
int hash_code = 7362138 ; int width = 16 ; int offset_factor = 1 + abs ( hash_code ) % ( width - 2 ) ;
This works because even if two hash codes result in the same home address , it is still unlikely that the offset_factor is the same for two items with the same hash code .
The probing sequence then becomes something like 1 * offset_factor , 2 * offset_factor , 3 * offset_factor , etc .
Efficiency of hashing
Some very bright people went ahead and calculated the efficiency of each of these three distinct collision resolution algorithms as load factor increases that I 've decided to include here .
Load Factor 0.10 0.25 0.50 0.75 0.90 2.00 INSERT
Chained hashing 0.10 0.25 0.50 0.75 0.90 2.00 Linear probing 1.12 1.39 2.50 8.50 50.50 N/ A Double hashing 1.11 1.33 2.00 4.00 10.00 N/A FIND / REMOVE Chained hashing 1.05 1.12 1.25 1.37 1.45 2.00 Linear probing 1.06 1.17 1.50 2.50 5.50 N/ A Double hashing 1.05 1.15 1.39 1.85 2.56 N/
A
You 'll notice that both probing approaches cannot cope when the load factor is over 1.0 .
This is obvious when you think about what the load factor means .
Especially it means how many items exist in each bucket , since the buckets are finite it is impossible to have a higher load factor than 1.0 !
Conclusions
As shown in the table in the previous section I can safely give the following conclusions .
Use chained hashing , select an appropriate hash function for your keys and make a suitable choice regarding the width of your table and you shall be the king of efficient hashing .
Remember that probing methodologies require a lower load factor than chained hashing for efficient access and this means a wider table with more redundancy than chained hashing which not only is faster , and not only can carry an infinite load factor ( although obviously the efficiency nose dives as the load factor increases ) but it operates with higher load factors much better than probing methods .
Finally be aware that although it 's not obvious whether a prime table width or a power of 2 width is superior as with most things in engineering identify the advantages and disadvantages of each approach and select the approach that is best for the likely data that will be managed by your hashing implementation .

Oxfam raises much of its funding through its network of bookshops Booksellers have complained that Oxfam is damaging independent bookshops by taking away their business .
The Provincial Booksellers Fairs Association ( PBFA ) says there is ill - feeling among second - hand booksellers towards the charity .
The PBFA 's John Bonham said Oxfam had " a very good start on us " and had many advantages over bookshops .
But Suzy Smith , Oxfam books project manager , said it was not operating for private gain , but to eradicate poverty .
The PBFA represents almost 600 bookshops , which Mr Bonham said did not have the kinds of advantages afforded to Oxfam .
" Their books are donated by the public , they get very advantageous rates for their property , their volunteers - except for their managers - are unpaid , and they get charitable status as far as tax is concerned , which of course is a great help when you 're running a business , " he said .
I would be grateful if Oxfam would n't position their shops very close to any of our second hand bookshops
John Bonham , PBFA Mr Bonham said internet book sales had also " caused a lot of book dealers a fair amount of grief " and stressed he was " all in favour of Oxfam " .
He added : " But on the other hand I do feel there 's no level playing field here .
If only there could be one , I think that booksellers would n't whine about it .
" There 's two things that could possibly happen .
One , I would be grateful if Oxfam would n't position their shops very close to any of our second hand bookshops .
Try to choose towns where there are no bookshops .
" Second thing , it would be nice if there would some possibility of rate relief or tax relief for second - hand booksellers ... because the government has made it quite clear that they'd like to see the literacy level higher , and second - hand bookshops are one of the greatest ways of doing it . "

More from Today programme Jeff Towns , owner of Dylan 's book store in Swansea , said he and his colleagues in the book trade cared about relieving hunger and poverty , but they " also care about our profession " .
He said Oxfam 's shops were " smart , rather bland and soulless compared to the sort of bookshops I 've always enjoyed going into .
" But they 're going to change the townscape that we have , and Oxfam will be the only bookshops we 'll see , and the great eccentric buildings that used to litter our provincial cities will disappear , " he added .
Contributing factors
Ms Smith said Oxfam needed to raise funds in order for it to help people who were living in extreme poverty .
" There are a billion people living in poverty around the world , living on less than a dollar a day , no basic water and sanitation , no access to education and obviously that 's Oxfam 's main priority , " she said .
Ms Smith admitted the recession was making things " very , very tough " for businesses such as independent booksellers .
" But there are other factors which have a greater effect than Oxfam that are involved in the change in the market for second - hand books .
" Online retailing , for example , grocers such as ...
Tesco , other things such as the increase in private rents and energy bills , that we also have to pay .
" Also we 're in a market and in a business where it 's high volume for low profit , so the recession 's making that very , very difficult , " she said .

As the Minnesota Vikings went through training camp this month , Brett Favre remained in Mississippi , beginning to feel the twinge of doubt he had dreaded with his first two retirements .
So when Vikings Coach Brad Childress , whom Favre had spurned just three weeks ago , called out of the blue Monday to ask , once and for all , if he wanted to return , Favre ’s response was simple : “ Can I play Friday ? ”
And so Favre , serial retirer , unretired for the second time in less than two years Tuesday , joining the Vikings for a contract that ESPN reported was worth $ 12 million this season and $ 13 million in 2010  if he does not retire again .
The Vikings had courted Favre , a three - time league most valuable player , throughout the off - season but were left empty - handed on the eve of training camp when Favre said he would not play .
When Favre initially said he would not come back , Childress said he thought the Vikings ’ interest in him was finished .
That did not last long , and on Tuesday , perhaps to make sure Favre would not change his mind again , Childress picked him up at a small airport in St. Paul .

Paris , le 27 mai 2009 – La loi LOPPSI vient d’être déposée au Conseil des Ministres pour un examen prochain au parlement .
Elle contient entre autres la mise en place d’une infrastructure extrêmement inquiétante de filtrage des contenus sur Internet .
Ce dispositif , inefficace dans la lutte ô combien légitime contre la pédopornographie , ouvre en réalité la porte à la censure d’Internet et constitue une grave atteinte à la neutralité du réseau .
Les citoyens doivent refuser ce contrôle du Net dicté par le président Sarkozy .
Michèle Alliot - Marie vient de présenter son projet de loi pour la performance de la sécurité intérieure ( LOPPSI ) en Conseil des Ministres .
Il sera donc examiné au parlement dans les prochains mois , dans le cadre d’une procédure d’urgence .
Cette loi contient un article 4 extrêmement inquiétant qui prévoit d’imposer aux fournisseurs d’accès à Internet ( FAI ) de filtrer une liste de sites qui lui serait régulièrement transmise par le ministère de l’intérieur .
Si l’objectif de lutter contre la pédopornographie est évidemment louable et partagé pour tous , le filtrage des sites ne peut en aucun cas représenter une solution efficace à ces pratiques criminelles :
Toutes les technologies de filtrage sont inefficaces et facilement contournables .
La mise en place du filtrage poussera ces pratiques dans plus de clandestinité , ce qui rendra la répression efficace plus difficile .

Le filtrage des contenus sur Internet par voie administrative est la porte ouverte à des erreurs et à la censure , comme le démontrent les expériences catastrophiques en Finlande et en Australie .
Le gouvernement australien vient finalement de renoncer à un tel dispositif où moins de 32 % des sites filtrés étaient en réalité des contenus à caractère pédopornographique .
Les 68 % restant comprenaient notamment des sites anti-filtrage et anti-censure .
« L’instrumentalisation de la pédopornographie pour justifier la mise en œuvre de dispositifs de contrôle du Net ouvrant la porte à la censure est intolérable .
L’examen de la LOPPSI doit être l’occasion d’un débat public sur l’inefficacité des dispositifs de filtrage et les menaces qu’ils font planer sur les libertés individuelles , ainsi que sur les moyens réels , humains et financiers , de lutte contre la pédopornographie .
Les citoyens doivent se mobiliser pour que le filtrage soit abandonné à tout prix , comme en Australie où il a été un échec cuisant .

Had I READ the Health Care Plan ?
I mean had I even READ it .
I have to admit I had not .
I already know that it mandates sex changes for all , forces abortion for non -gay babies , and sets up crematoria for old people , but as a liberal , these are all policies I welcome .
However , what might I be trading away in return for all these beneficial policies ?
But there 's one thing that is very suspicious about all this .
For some reason I can't put my finger on , I find I 'm angry all the time , especially after listening to my favorite radio talk shows .
I do n't know what I 'm angry about exactly , it could be my failed marriages , my tenuous finances , my life not turning out the way I had hoped .
All I know for sure is that all my problems are the fault of someone other than myself .
Someone most likely a lot darker than I am .
And now I find out that Obama 's Health Care plan includes a provision to annex the Sudetenland , JUST LIKE HITLER !
I 'm so scared , not just about this , of course , but about all the other things in this modern world I do n't understand .
I look to the Bible for guidance in all things .
When it says to exclude the Moabites , I start excluding them wherever I find them .
You wo n't see me including any damned Moabites , not on your life !
By the way , if you spell Obama backwards and leave out some of the letters , is n't it pretty strange that it spells Moab ?
That 's pretty scary , too .
With evidence mounting that Obama is hiding his real birth certificate because it will show he is actually cloned from a hair follicle extracted from Hitler 's nose , why does it not also seem reasonable that he plans to follow in Hitler 's footsteps by annexing Sudetenland ?
And DON'T forget about POLAND !.
It 's just too much .
He must be stopped .
I want my country back !
But not the Sudetenland .

“ Are seniors going to be in front of a death panel ?

If you use a cell phone , chances are you ’re aware of “ text messaging ” — brief messages limited to 160 characters that can be sent or received on all modern mobile phones .
Texting , also known as SMS ( for short message service ) , is on the rise , up from 9.8 billion messages a month in December ’05 to 110.4 billion in December ’08 .
Undoubtedly , more than a few of those messages are being sent by people driving cars .
Is texting while driving a dangerous idea ?
We decided to conduct a test .
Previous academic studies — much more scientific than ours — conducted in vehicle simulators have shown that texting while driving impairs the driver ’s abilities .
But as far as we know , no study has been conducted in a real vehicle that is being driven .
Also , we decided to compare the results of texting to the effects of drunk driving , on the same day and under the exact same conditions .
Not surprisingly , Car and Driver does n’t receive a lot of research grants .
To keep things simple , we would focus solely on the driver ’s reaction times to a light mounted on the windshield at eye level , meant to simulate a lead car ’s brake lights .
Wary of the potential damage to man and machine , all of the driving would be done in a straight line .
We rented the taxiway of the Oscoda - Wurtsmith Airport in Oscoda , Michigan , adjacent to an 11,800 - foot runway that used to be home to a squadron of B - 52 bombers .
Given the prevalence of the BlackBerry , the iPhone , and other text - friendly mobile phones , the test subjects would have devices with full “ qwerty ” keypads and would be using text - messaging phones familiar to them .
Web intern Jordan Brown , 22 , armed with an iPhone , would represent the younger crowd .
The older demographic would be covered by head honcho Eddie Alterman , 37 ( or 259 in dog years ) , using a Samsung Alias .
( Alterman also uses a BlackBerry for e-mail .
We did n’t use it in the test . )
Our long - term Honda Pilot served as the test vehicle .
When the red light on the windshield lit up , the driver was to hit the brakes .
The author , riding shotgun , would use a hand - held switch to trigger the red light and monitor the driver ’s results .
A Racelogic VBOX III data logger combined and recorded the test data from three areas : vehicle speed via the VBOX ’s GPS antenna ; brake - pedal position and steering angle via the Pilot ’s OBD II port ; and the red light ’s on / off status through an analog input .
Each trial would have the driver respond five times to the light , and the slowest reaction time ( the amount of time between the activation of the light and the driver hitting the brakes ) was dropped .

Brown ignores it .
AARON KILEY
First , we tested both drivers ’ reaction times at 35 mph and 70 mph to get baseline readings .
Then we repeated the driving procedure while they read a text message aloud ( a series of Caddyshack quotes ) .
This was followed by a trial with the drivers typing the same message they had just received .
Both of our lab rats were instructed to use their phones exactly as they would on a public road , which , if Jordan ’s mom or Eddie ’s wife are reading this , they never do .
Our test subjects then got out of the vehicle and concentrated on getting slightly intoxicated .
They wanted something that would work quickly : screwdrivers ( vodka and orange juice ) .
Between the two of them , they knocked back all but three ounces of a fifth of Smirnoff .
Soon they were laughing at all our jokes , asking for cigarettes , and telling us about some previous time they got drunk that was totally awesome .
We had them blow into a Lifeloc FC10 breath - alcohol analyzer until they reached the legal driving limit of 0.08 percent blood - alcohol content .
We then put them behind the wheel and ran the light - and - brake test without any texting distraction .
The Results
The results , though not surprising , were eye - opening .
Intern Brown ’s baseline reaction time at 35 mph of 0.45 second worsened to 0.57 while reading a text , improved to 0.52 while writing a text , and returned almost to the baseline while impaired by alcohol , at 0.46 .
At 70 mph , his baseline reaction was 0.39 second , while the reading ( 0.50 ) , texting ( 0.48 ) , and drinking ( 0.50 ) numbers were similar .
But the averages do n’t tell the whole story .
Looking at Jordan ’s slowest reaction time at 35 mph , he traveled an extra 21 feet ( more than a car length ) before hitting the brakes while reading and went 16 feet longer while texting .
At 70 mph , a vehicle travels 103 feet every second , and Brown ’s worst reaction time while reading at that speed put him about 30 feet ( 31 while typing ) farther down the road versus 15 feet while drunk .
Alterman fared much , much worse .
While reading a text and driving at 35 mph , his average baseline reaction time of 0.57 second nearly tripled , to 1.44 seconds .
While texting , his response time was 1.36 seconds .
These figures correspond to an extra 45 and 41 feet , respectively , before hitting the brakes .
His reaction time after drinking averaged 0.64 second and , by comparison , added only seven feet .
The results at 70 mph were similar : Alterman ’s response time while reading a text was 0.35 second longer than his base performance of 0.56 second , and writing a text added 0.68 second to his reaction time .
But his intoxicated number increased only 0.04 second over the base score , to a total of 0.60 second .
As with the younger driver , Alterman ’s slowest reaction times were a grim scenario .
He went more than four seconds before looking up while reading a text message at 35 mph and over three and a half seconds while texting at 70 mph .
Even in the best of his bad reaction times while reading or texting , Alterman traveled an extra 90 feet past his baseline performance ; in the worst case , he went 319 feet farther down the road .
Moreover , his two - hands - on - the - phone technique resulted in some serious lane drifting .
AARON KILEY
AARON KILEY
The prognosis does n’t improve when you look at the limitations of our test .
We were using a straight road without any traffic , road signals , or pedestrians , and we were only looking at reaction times .
Even though our young driver fared better than the balding Alterman , Brown ’s method of holding the phone up above the dashboard and typing with one hand would make it difficult to do anything except hit the brakes .
And if anything in the periphery required a response , well , both drivers would probably be screwed .
Also , do n’t take the intoxicated results to be acceptable just because they ’re an improvement over the texting numbers .
They only look better because the texting results are so horrendously bad .
The buzzed Jordan had to be told twice which lane to drive in , and in the real world , that mistake could mean a head - on crash .
And we remind again that we only measured response to a light — the reduction in motor skills and cognitive power associated with impaired driving were n’t really exposed here .
Both socially and legally , drunk driving is completely unacceptable .
Texting , on the other hand , is still in its formative period with respect to laws and opinion .
A few jurisdictions have passed ordinances against texting while driving .
But even if sweeping legislation were passed to outlaw any typing behind the wheel , it would still be difficult to enforce the law .
AARON KILEY
In our test , neither subject had any idea that using his phone would slow down his reaction time so much .
Like most folks , they think they ’re pretty good drivers .
Our results prove otherwise , at both city and highway speeds .
The key element to driving safely is keeping your eyes and your mind on the road .
Text messaging distracts any driver from that primary task .
So the next time you ’re tempted to text , tweet , e-mail , or otherwise type while driving , either ignore the urge or pull over .
We do n’t want you rear - ending us .

Forget taxing the rich , the obese or your employer ’s health benefits .
Here ’s an even better way to turn health reform financing into a wedge issue .
Some members of Congress are reportedly considering a cosmetic surgery tax to help pay for health reform ( a.k.a. the “ Botax ” ) .
Such a tax could be a big revenue - raiser , since Americans spend billions of dollars on cosmetic surgeries each year .
It may also discourage more people from getting plastic surgery ( which mothers of teenage girls everywhere might consider a good thing , I suppose ) .
It might also lead to a slippery slope — and a tax on a significantly more controversial medical procedure .
If Congress can tax cosmetic surgeries , asks the libertarian law professor Glenn Reynolds , what about abortion ?
Both are performed by doctors , and both are often done on an elective basis .
Taxes on both types of procedures have been proposed before , as Paul L. Caron , a tax professor at the University of Cincinnati College of Law , notes on his TaxProf blog .
Professor Caron cites several tax cases with similar constitutional undertones .
In 1983 , for example , the Supreme Court ruled that a Minnesota use - tax on paper and ink products violated a newspaper ’s first amendment rights .
Jonathan Adler , a professor at the Case Western Reserve University School of Law , has also weighed in on the constitutionality of an abortion tax .
On the Volokh Conspiracy , a legal blog , he writes that such a tax likely would not hold up under scrutiny :
Legal Handbook for Animal Rights and Environmental Activists
The National Lawyers Guild has created a great new resource , “ Operation Backfire : a Survival Guide for Environmental and Animal Rights Activists . ”
It ’s a booklet on how environmental and animal rights activists have been targeted by the government and branded as the top domestic terrorism threat .
It also has a great “ know your rights ” section that offers information on :
handling encounters with the police and FBI in various situations
suggestions for how to respond when questioned or presented with a warrant
information about your rights when asked for identification or a DNA sample
a discussion of grand juries , subpoenas , and FBI attempts to turn activists into informants .
To request free copies , call the National Lawyers Guild office at ( 212 ) 679-5100 .
You can also download the booklet at nlg.org ( I also uploaded “ Operation Backfire ” here on GreenIsTheNewRed , as a backup ) .

" The fact that honey can be toxic and / or psychoactive - in other words , inebriating - has long been known and has been demonstrated throughout the world .... "
In the district on the Pontus , among the people of the Sanni , there is a kind of honey that is known as maenomenon [ " mad maker " ] because of the insanity it induces .
It is thought that this is caused by the flowers of the oleanders [ Rhododendron ] , which abound in the woods .
( Pliny 21.77 )

Cab , honig , kab , ksandra ( Sanskrit ) , mel , mella , mielHoney is a substance produced by the domestic honeybee [ ( ) ] and by wild bees ( spp. , spp. ) from the nectar and pollen of various plants .
" Honey is perhaps the only predigested food that humans know " ( Root 1996 , 127 ) .
Honey has been used to makesince the Stone Age .
The fact that honey can be toxic and / or psychoactive - in other words , inebriating - has long been known and has been demonstrated throughout the world ( Palmer - Jones 1965 ) .
Honey also has a long history of use as a healing remedy or a " heavenly medicine . "
In Hippocratic medicine , honey was used as " a kind of psychopharmacological agent to treat depression and melancholia , and as a geriatric medicine . "
It was also used as an antidote for opium overdoses ( Uccusic 1987 , 38 f. ; see ) .
There are three categories of plants that are associated with toxic honey : 1 ) plants whose nectar or pollen kills bees before they can transform it into honey ( e.g. locoweed [ ] , spp. ) ; 2 ) plants whose nectar is harmless to bees but when turned into honey becomes toxic / inebriating to humans ( e.g. oleander [ ] , thorn apple [ spp . ] .
angel 's trumpet [ spp. ] , mountain laurel [ spp. ] , false jasmine [ ] , ) ; and 3 ) known poisonous plants that are harmless to bees and yield edible and often exquisite honey ( e.g. , ) ( Morton 1964 , 415 ) .
Xenophon ( ca. 430-355 B.C.E. ) reported in his Anabis that soldiers became inebriated and poisoned by the honey that had been produced from the Pontic rhododendron ( L. ) and apparently from a red- flowering oleander ( L. : cf. Rätsch 1995 , 267 f. ) ( Roth et al. 1994 , 615 ) .
" In modern terms , they ' got high . ' . . .
This condition did not last long amongst the Greeks and quickly abated " ( Rüdiger 1974 , 93 ) .
The toxicological literature refers to this Pontic ( Turkish ) honey as " mad honey " or " toxic honey of Asia Minor " ( Fühner 1943 , 203 ) .
This inebriating honey was well known in ancient times ( Krause 1926 ; Plugge 1891 ) , and it may have been involved with the Dionysian frenzies :
In ancient times , it was believed that oleander first came from the land of Colchis ( on the Black Sea ) ; it was regarded as a plant of the " witch " Medea ( who may have been a Scythian shamaness ) .
Apparently , oleander also had something to do with the wines that were drunk during the Dionysian orgies .
Oleander was a popular subject in the wall frescos of Pompeii , a city known for its Bacchic mysteries .
Oleander leaves contain the powerful cardiac poison oleandrin , which can be life - threatening for humans and animals because it can paralyze the heart .
Also present are digitalis - like glycosides ( neriine , nerianthine , adyrin , cotenerin ) .
The milky latex contains salacin and other alkaloids .
Although oleander is frequently said to be toxic , the toxicological literature contains no observations of dangerous intoxications resulting from the consumption of the flowers and leaves ( Frohne and Pfander 1983 , 47 ) .
An alchemical papyrus dated from the late ancient times contains a puzzling recipe made with " mad honey " : " Preparation of emerald .
1 part burned copper , 2 parts verdigris , and a corresponding amount of Pontic honey , cook for one hour " ( in Hengstl 1978 , 272 ) .
Like all later alchemical recipes , this recipe appears to contain secret instructions for a consciousness process associated with the transmutation of matter .
The inclusion of psychoactive honey is particularly interesting .
In ancient times , honey was mixed with ground medicinal herbs ( such as wormwood [ cf. ] ) and other pharmaceutical substances to produce what were know as " lick agents , " a kind of pharmaceutical " hard candy . "
Some of these may have had psychoactive effects , for example : " A remedy to cool the uterus : hemp is pounded in honey and administered to the vagina .
This is a contraction [ of the uterus ] " ( 821 [ 1550 B.C.E. ] ; in Manniche 1989 , 82 ) .
The Mayans regard honey ( ) as a gift of the bee gods ( ) , a food from the heavens ( Tozzer and Allen 1910 , 298 ff . ) .
An indigenous form of apiculture was practiced in the Yucatan in pre-Columbian times ( Brunius 1995 ) .
In the Yucatan and Selva Lacandona regions ( Chiapas ) , several species of native stingless bees ( Family Meliponidae ) make their honey from the nectar of specific flowers .
The Lacandon know that at certain times of the year ( the flowering periods ) , bees produce types of honey that have psychoactive or inebriating effects , even when consumed in small amounts .
As little as one tablespoon is sufficient to produce noticeable effects .
I once tried two tablespoons of such honey dissolved in ( a maize drink ) and experienced rather strong feelings of inebriation and extreme good cheer .
The Yucatec Maya have domesticatedand now keep these bees in special hives ( hollowed - out tree trunks ) to produce honey ( Buchmann and Nabhan 1996 ) .
The significance of this honey is more religious and ritual than culinary .
It is offered at various planting rites and also is fermented to make , which is thus a type of ( Brunius 1995 ) .
In the Yucatan , the honey made from certain vines ( spp. and ) is called of ( Souza Novelo et al. 1981 , 32 ) .
Such honey has psychoactive effects and is preferred for making balche ' .
A liquor known by the same name is produced in the region of Valladolid .
This honey is usually harvested in November and December ( Brunius 1995 , 20 ) .
Certain active constituents in plants can pass into the nectar of the flowers , and the bees metabolize these either not at all or only a little when they produce the honey .
For example , the toxic grayanotoxins present in rhododendrons and the tropane alkaloids ( especially atropine ) found in belladonna flowers can both pass into the honey that is derived from their flowers .
Some species of rhododendron , for example azaleas , contain the toxic terpene andromedotoxin ( = grayanotoxin , rhodotoxin ) .

The decline of America ’s car industry has hurt the Canadian economy too .
Revival depends on making it easier to cross the border — or on seeking markets elsewhere
Illustration by David Simonds
FOR almost a century the fate and fortune of Windsor , Ontario , have been intertwined with those of Detroit , Michigan .
General Motors ( GM ) , Ford and Chrysler made cars on both sides of the Detroit River , sending parts and vehicles back and forth at will .
Windsorites worked in the car plants , loyally bought the cars , followed American sports teams , and thought nothing of driving over the Ambassador Bridge or popping through the Detroit - Windsor tunnel for a night on the town .
So the collapse into bankruptcy of GM and Chrysler has brought Windsor down along with Detroit .
A blue - collar city of 273,000 people , Windsor now has the highest jobless rate in Canada ( 14.4 % ) and faces an uncertain future .
Its decline is visible on Ouellette Avenue , the main commercial artery .
On some blocks , more shops have shut down than are still open .
The brightest sign on the street announces the grand opening of Dollarama , a deep discount store .
On the riverside promenade the headquarters of Chrysler Canada , opened with much hoopla in 2002 , stands partly empty , a “ For Rent ” sign on the plate - glass window of its showroom .
Truck traffic between Windsor and Detroit — the busiest crossing - point on the Canadian border — fell by a third in the first six months of this year compared with the same period in 2008 .
Windsor 's woes are echoed across southern Ontario , the heartland of industrial Canada , which depends on exporting to the United States .
Tighter security at the border after the terrorist attacks of September 2001 and a stronger Canadian dollar constrained the region 's economy even before the American economy plunged into recession in late 2007 , with Detroit leading the decline .
Between them , Canada 's federal government and Ontario 's provincial administration contributed C$ 14.5 billion ( $ 13.4 billion ) to the bail - outs of GM and Chrysler .
That was enough to deter them from pulling out of the country .
But they will cut a slimmer figure .
Output and employment in Canada 's car industry will end up at least a third below the 1999 peak of 3 m vehicles and 160,000 workers at assembly plants and parts - makers , says Dennis DesRosiers , an industry analyst .
It helps that Toyota and Honda , with factories in Ontario , are keeping most of their workers .
Ontario's problems go wider than cars .
Recession has curbed demand for its minerals and forest products .
Nortel , a telecoms firm that was once Canada 's leading high - tech company , recently entered bankruptcy .
Bits of it are being sold off piecemeal .
Two - thirds of the 370,000 jobs lost in Canada between October 2008 and June 2009 were in Ontario , most of them in manufacturing .
Ontario's economy is still the biggest in Canada .
But it is no longer the richest .
Indeed Ontario is now classified as a have - not province , making it eligible for handouts from a federal fund to equalise public spending across the country .
It has even been granted its own federally funded economic development agency .
Some pundits reckon that rather than bailing out industrial dinosaurs government should be encouraging new technologies .
Supporters of Dalton McGuinty , the province 's premier , say that he had no choice but to help to bail out the car industry because of its size .
( He also offered a subsidy of C$ 10,000 to each purchaser of an electric car . )
Critics contrast this largesse with the government 's failure to help Nortel .
Stephen Harper , Canada 's Conservative prime minister , faces nationalist pressure to veto a bid of $ 1.1 billion from Sweden 's Ericsson for its wireless technology division and find a Canadian buyer .
Even in car - mad Windsor people are starting to realise that change is inevitable .
Eddie Francis , the mayor , says he hopes to make the municipal airport a processing centre for perishable cargo .
He says that some of the city 's car - parts makers have started supplying oil companies and Quebec 's aerospace industry .
But diversification is not easy .
Caesars Windsor , a massive casino , convention centre and hotel aimed at the 17 m
Americans who live within a three - hour drive , is suffering along with the car industry .
Its workforce has shrunk from a peak of 5,400 before 2001 to 3,800 today .
“ It 's not true that casinos are recession - proof , ” says Keith Andrews , the casino 's spokesman .
He is sitting in the hotel 's 10,000 square - foot ( 930 square - metre ) lobby , where statues of Roman gods and goddesses outnumber guests .
Canada 's economy , like that of the United States , shows signs of recovery .
Though weakened , the car industry will survive .
The biggest headache for places like Windsor may be the thickening border .
Since June 1st those returning to the United States from Canada have been required to show a passport ( or another approved identity document ) , where a driving licence was always sufficient .
Janet Napolitano , the secretary for homeland security , talks of treating America 's northern border more like its southern one with Mexico ( where the building of a fence on long stretches continues ) .
Security measures are not the only impediment to travel between Detroit and Windsor .
The privately owned Ambassador Bridge and the public road and rail tunnels that link the two cities are old and narrow .
Plans to build a new bridge , or add a span to the existing one , have bogged down in lawsuits .
The owner of the Ambassador Bridge wants to protect his near - monopoly .
Like it or not , Canada is uncomfortably dependent on the United States as a market , with 76 % of its exports going to its southern neighbour .
Mr Harper 's government has tried to open new markets .
It is now negotiating a free - trade agreement with the European Union , for example .
But places like Windsor , just a short stretch of water from the flickering beacon that is Detroit , can only hope that the American economy is quickly restored to health .
BEIJING ( Reuters ) - Three Chinese miners were rescued after being trapped in a coal mine for 25 days , while 12 more remain underground , state media reported on Sunday .
The Xinqiao mine , in southwestern China ’s Guizhou province , was flooded on June 17 .
At least one miner died .
The three miners were in a stable condition when they were lifted from the mine , and could communicate in simple sentences , CCTV said .
It did not explain how they had survived .
The mine is licensed to produce 150,000 tonnes of coal a year .
It was in violation of safety regulations , Xinhua said .
China ’s coal mining industry is the world ’s most dangerous , killing about 3,000 people in 2008 .
This is part of my RPG series of entries here at SOB .
See the inaugural entry in the series for more details .
Years ago , in AD&D 2E — in the early ’90s , in fact — when the world was young and dinosaurs roamed the earth , a campaign world called Dark Sun was published .
This campaign world was deadly enough that first level characters were pretty much chowder , so it was recommended that all characters start at third level .
In those days , multiclassing was ( according to the published rules ) a pretty hairy , annoying thing , and nobody I knew liked to do it .
It was better , when you needed a multitalented character , to make either a Bard ( Bards were jacks of all trades in 2E rather than imbeciles who sat around playing Cat ’s in the Cradle while everyone else was fighting and dying ) or a new character class to suit the concept .
Somewhat more recently , roughly the Dark Ages , 3E came out and multiclassing changed dramatically .
It became something useful now , something that actually worked well for fleshing out character concepts .
All was rejoicing .
Then , merely a year ago ( but still using that colonial era game , D&D 3.5 , despite the availability of “ modern ” 4E ) , the SigO and I were invited to play a game with a few people with whom we ’ve never played before .
One of them was a friend of mine who had basically never played an RPG in his life , and the others were friends of his .
We showed up and were told we’d be making characters of a somewhat higher than normal level , though I do n’t remember the exact level .
Maybe fifth ?
The Baran Cole Problem
Out of that experience , which lasted for all of one actual session of play ( we were n’t a fan of the GM ’s style , and he apparently did n’t like all that “ roleplaying ” we were doing either ) , came my character concept Baran Cole .
He ’s a multiclassed Fighter / Rogue , a bit of a scoundrel , a solitary mercenary ( after his mercenary company was betrayed by its employer and slaughtered down to a few scattered survivors ) , and a gambling addict with a bit of a deathwish .
We started out with some magical gear , of course , being higher than first ( or even third ) level characters , and I basically blew all my magic item budget on some good armor — good enough to suit a single - class fighter — whose best characteristics were its silence and lack of penalties for roguish skills or mobility .
Well , after only getting to play the guy once — and after the SigO only got to play her character , Vettig the greasy underworld enforcer ( a single - class half - elven rogue with something like a 17 or 18 Strength score ) , once as well — we discovered we really liked the character concepts .
We just needed a campaign in which to play them together .
Alas , since that time , nobody has started running an appropriately D&D - like ( or PRPG - like ) game other than the SigO and me .
As a result , we still have n’t gotten a chance to slot them into a game anywhere .
Even once we find someone to run a Pathfinder game , it ’ll need to be someone willing to run a campaign where they ’d fit in , and where we could make characters of higher than first level .
I ’m not saying we ’d necessarily have to play them at the levels at which we originally made them .
When I hashed out the background for my character , however , I did so only based on his current skill set , without thinking about things in terms of how characters progress according to the rules .
As such , in his background , I had Baran Cole essentially a Fighter / Rogue starting at level 0 ( just a really weak one at that point ) .
Worse , I had him getting his special armor at something like first or second level — but , more to the point , at a stage in his background that should be in his past when I start playing him .
After all , background is a huge chunk of what makes the character interesting to me .
Some Partial Solutions
In the process of thinking this stuff through , I started coming up with ideas for some house rules that could be used to help ease the pain of coming up with good character concepts with rich backgrounds and having to figure out how to fit them into the rules .
I also started combining these thoughts with other thoughts about how to house - rule the game into a better state of affairs for verisimilitude of an ongoing campaign and similar issues not specifically related to the Baran Cole “ problem ” .
One such result of these ponderations was Special Item Advancement , an idea for a set of rules designed for adjudicating customized special items — magic items , for instance — that grow with the character rather than just being traded in on newer models in a typical treasure churn .
Another major outcome of thinking about this stuff , partially inspired by Dark Sun , partially by the problem of Baran Cole , and partly just by my laziness in wanting to avoid creating custom classes all the time ( though I ’ll still do so sometimes ) , is to just decide that in future games characters who would otherwise start at first level should always start at second .
That way , you can have two levels of one class if you like or one level each of two classes , or maybe even mix in some NPC classes from the DMG ( in D&D ) or the GM ’s resources in the PRPG core book if you like — with an exchange rate that allows one to have NPC classes more cheaply than PC classes .
This allows for greater richness of character background at character creation , as well as allowing one to hybridize the character archetypes a bit for a starting character .
The Case for Second Level
Treating second ( rather than first ) level as “ starting level ” or “ entry level ” is n’t really an earth - shattering “ new ” idea that ’ll revolutionize gaming everywhere .
I do think it ’s something most gamers do n’t consider , however — especially for those who have n’t played Dark Sun , I guess .
I also think it ’s important to make a case for it , so that those who ’ve encountered the idea but rejected it out of hand might be inclined to revisit the notion .
After all , “ second level ” according to the rules is n’t exactly the same as making high - level characters in the game ; it ’s still pretty much in the category of “ weak ” and “ beginner ” .
Even when gamers have considered starting characters at higher than first level , they probably skipped over second in their considerations , because the concern was probably more over playing a higher - level campaign or playing characters who are already established heroes .
In my experience , though , most players creating first - level characters have some ideas in mind for a character who has some background and experience in the world that makes him or her something of a professional quality practitioner of whatever the character does best .
Sometimes , it can be difficult to justify this in light of the relative weakness of first level characters in the world .
Second seems to be the point where competence is starting to be something characters can claim , where more than one fight a day is n’t a recipe for severe danger of losing a party member under pretty much any conditions .
It ’s the point where you ’re playing the character you wanted to make , rather than the character for which the rules said you had to settle .
It ’s not the same as the 4E approach of making people walking murder machines , dealing death as easily as dealing a hand of Old Maid .
It ’s also not the same as making a supposedly professional swordsman and having him fall in battle to an average farmer , though .
It seems like the ideal place to start , particularly where an entry level adventurer who nonetheless has enough experience under his belt to be something more than just a farm kid who left home yesterday is concerned — but it is still weak enough that for the most part , farm kids who left home yesterday are still within reach of the character creation standards , if only just .
. . .
But Not Only Second Level
There will always be room for games that start at first level .
I just tend to think that should n’t be the default , any more than requiring all players to start with only one level and making them choose an NPC class for that level should be the default .
In fact , I think for games that start out weaker than second level , next time I have the motivation to run one , I ’ll actually make the players choose NPC classes instead of PC classes — and grow into their PC classes .
Ever wonder why projector systems and televisions does n't use laser illumination ?
It is n't for safety reasons , and it is n't for efficiency reasons — laser diodes have efficiencies ranging from 30 to 50 percent .
No , the problem is green light .
We have red laser diodes , and blue laser diodes turned up nearly 15 years ago .
But green — where the heck is the green laser diode ?
A group of Japanese researchers have answered that question : in our lab .
Yes , they have the first " true green " laser diode .
It does n't work that well yet but , based on past history , expect rapid progress from here and commercial laser diodes before the end of next year .
I guess the big question is " what took them so long ? "
And the answer to that question is a little bit complicated .
First , lets take a look at " normal " lasers .
The color of light generated by a normal laser , such as the red of a helium - neon laser or the blue - green of an Argon ion laser , is not under our control .
Lasers require a rather special set of conditions to be met before they will work , and , nature only satisfies these with certain material / color combinations .
This was , and continues to be , an immense source of frustration to scientists .
Laser diodes , which are made using the junction between two or more semiconductor materials , are slightly different .
In this case , the color of the light is determined by the energy difference between the conducting electrons and the lowest available states in the nonconducting valence band .
This gap can be adjusted by combining different materials and making sandwich structures , called quantum wells .
So , you end up with complicated materials , like alloys of aluminum , indium , gallium , and arsenide , combined with careful layering .
One layer might have gallium , arsenide , and aluminum , while the next will have gallium , indium , and aluminum , and so on .
To adjust the gap , one changes the ratios between the different components .
In principle , one can get any color , from blue right through to the mid-infrared , by combining the appropriate semiconductor materials .
But the world had to wait about 20 years for the blue laser diode and another 15 years for green , so what went wrong ?
Pooling indium and other difficulties
The general problem is that certain combinations of materials do n't alloy very well .
For instance , blue laser diodes use a gallium nitride system , and figuring out how to get nitride to mix through the gallium evenly turned out to be quite difficult .
Green , it turns out , requires a high level of indium in certain layers of the quantum well structures .
Unfortunately , the indium diffuses and pools together , and that messes up the whole structure .
The other problem is that gallium nitride has a natural electric field associated with it .
Good gallium nitride substrates are typically grown in such a way that this field acts on electrons passing through the quantum well structures , preventing them from losing energy and emitting light .
In other words , the electric field quenches emission in the blue - green and green part of the spectrum .
The new researchers , from Semiconductor Technologies R&D Laboratories at Sumitomo Electric Industries , got around the electric field problem by changing the orientation of the gallium nitride substrate .
That is a story in itself , but , briefly , they found an appropriate template that encouraged the gallium nitride to grow so that it presents a different surface to the world , one that is electrically neutral .
On to this , they grew the various layers required for a green laser diode .
However , what they do n't tell us is how they prevented the indium from diffusing .
I would guess that the orientation of the substrate somehow slows the diffusion down .
In any case , the structure worked .
They report laser emission for colors between 520 and 531nm , which is pretty much dead center on the green color required for display technology .
Of course , the laser was n't very good : it was operated in pulsed mode ( all lasers operate in pulsed mode when they are first switched on ) .
The efficiency was also shockingly bad at 0.1 percent , mostly due to the pulsed nature — if we ignore the off time , the efficiency goes up to about 20 percent .
The authors observe that the electrical contacts were n't optimized , leading to high resistive losses ; the laser operated at about 20V , while a normal laser diode operates between 1 and 3V .
You can guarantee that those problems will be solved pretty quickly now that the researchers know they are on the right track .
Once volume production starts , prices will fall into line with red and blue laser diodes , and then the cost of projection display systems should fall dramatically .
In the end , what many researchers are aiming for are hand - held projection display systems .
For those of you wondering why green laser pointers exist , here is the short answer : take an infrared diode laser , use it to power another laser that is deep into the infrared .
Use an optical nonlinear crystal to double the frequency and half the wavelength of that laser .
You get 530nm light and profit from a complicated little device .
The overall efficiency of this process , however , is something like 6 percent .

More evidence that Apple ( AAPL ) will be adding cameras to the iPod touch and iPod nano :
In China , accessories manufacturers are already building sample cases for the new iPod specs .
Culf Of Mac has landed a bunch of pictures of new iPod touch and iPod nano sample cases with holes for cameras .
The iPod touch camera is in the center of the device , not the corner like on the iPhone .
We 're guessing here , but it might be helpful for image stabilization -- less movement ?
What 's the point ?
For the iPod touch , a video camera makes the device a stronger competitor to cheap camcorders like Cisco's ( CSCO ) Flip , and it makes games and apps that use the camera and video camera easier to sell .
( iPod touch owners -- a lot of kids -- buy a lot of games . )
For the iPod nano , it lengthens the life on a product Apple already knows is going to head toward zero .

Introduction
This 24 year old woman was the belted driver of a car travelling at 100 km /h on the highway .
She had her left arm outside the driver 's door window when she lost control of her car .
With her arm still outside the car flipped onto its side and travelled 20 - 30 metres in this position .
Paramedics found this patient with her hand trapped between the car door and the asphalt .
She was evaluated according to ATLS protocols and this was found to be an isolated injury .
Pictures From the Trauma Room :
Trauma Room Radiographs :
How would you manage this patient now ?
Tetanus status was unknown , but the patient recalled that she had her series of tetanus toxoid when she was a child .
She had no allergies , no history of renal dysfunction , and did not take any medication .
A detailed hand examination was carried out as part of the secondary survey .
Sensation was found to be intact in the Median , and Ulnar nerve distribution .
Motor function for all three nerves was intact .
There was no sensation to the radial side of the thumb which ( see picture ) had a hemi- degloving type injury .
Radial and Ulnar pulses were present , and there was no evidence of an acute Carpal Tunnel syndrome .
There were no injuries to the left upper extremity proximal to the forearm .
What is the appropriate management now ?
0.5 cc of Tetanus Toxoid was given , and the patient was also given 1g of Ancef , 40 mg of Gentamycin , and 1.5 milion units of Penicillin .
After informed consent was obtained , the operating room was booked for an urgent irrigation & debridement of this patient 's hand .
Limb salvage was considered to be possible given the intact perfusion and neurological function .
A staged procedure was felt to be the best option
What would the best management be for the second stage ?
There was extensive degloving of the distal thumb , with most of the distal phalanx missing ( see trauma room pictures ) .
Clinical and radiographic examination revealed that almost 1/2 of the total depth of the carpus was missing ( including articular cartilage ) and that there was massive bone loss from the distal ulna .
Finally , there was a large amount of soft tissue loss .
Therefore , the second stage procedure consisted of :
Repeat Irrigation and debridement
What would the postoperative plan be ?
Postoperatively , the arm was placed in a full - length splint .
Perfusion to the free flap was monitored for one week using continuous Laser Doppler Flow ( LDF ) readings .
The hand and elbow were immobilized for four weeks at which time sutures and the proximal radioulnar pin was removed .
The wrist remained splinted but active ROM was begun at the MCP , PIP and DIP joints of the fingers and at the elbow .
At the six week mark the pin across the MP joint of the thumb was removed , and a removable thermoplastic splint was applied .
Aggressive physiotherapy of the elbow ( flexion / extension / pronation / supination ) was begun , as was active and passive ROM of the fingers .
Two months postoperatively , the patient was doing well , had regained - 15 to 90 degrees of flexion at the MCP joints of her fingers , full ROM of the PIP / DIP joints , and could pro/supinate 60 degrees each direction .
The free flap remained viable and this young woman is scheduled for debulking of the free flap approiximately six months from her last surgery .
Videos of German tourists taking part in sex orgies are finding their way onto the internet - is a nightclub in Mallorca laying a porn trap ?
Holidaymakers are invited onto the stage to have sex with the club ’s dancers but in the heat of the moment they are unaware that they are being secretly filmed on mobile phones , with the footage then uploaded onto websites like ‘ Youporn ’ and ‘ Pornhub ’ .
And the videos can be embarrassing - particularly if partners , colleagues or the boss sees it !
The owners of the ' Paradies ' nightclub have told BILD that they do not distribute or use any of the footage for commercial gain , but if people in the crowd do then they ca n’t stop them .
After BILD revealed the orgies , the venue is being closely monitored and the wild nights investigated by the Spanish police .
On Monday a police spokesman said : “ The nightclub ’s license does not cover sex parties , for that the owners need a pornography license .
We will investigate it with our special department . ”
BILD ’s investigation shows that the club in Playa de Palma has been promoting its sex parties since the beginning of the summer .
Flyers boast of the ‘ Super Erotic Show ’ .
Hundreds of partygoers turn up to drink , dance and watch live sex all for € 15 .
Around 3.30 am six young women dressed in sexy underwear come on stage while a compere shouts : “ Welcome to the orgy in Paradies !
Who wants some ?
Who wants to come on stage ? ”
Many want to , but only six are chosen .
The crowd then watches them have sex .
One male participant said : “ I wanted to try something new , but my one bit me .
It was painful rather than pleasurable … ”

It 's sex IN the city in Barcelona as tourists drop their pants with prostitutes in the streets .
When she set out to write about the crow — the black sheep of the avian world — the naturalist Lyanda Lynn Haupt did n’t relish the task .
“ I never meant to watch crows especially , ” she admits in her curiously personal and thought - provoking meditation , “ Crow Planet . ”
“ Whenever I ask someone about chickadees or robins or flickers or other common birds . . . the response is almost always lackluster , noncommittal or at best blandly cheerful . ”
Crows , however , sometimes elicit raves ( “ They are so intelligent !
And beautiful ! ” ) , but far more often insults ( “ loud , ” “ poopy , ” “ evil , ” “ menacingly bold , ” “ harbingers of death ” ) .
Haupt knew the dark history that fed this distaste .
During the plague years in medieval Europe , crows “ scavenged the bodies lying uncovered in the streets . ”
In 1666 , she writes , after the great fire of London , so many crows descended on the victims that Charles II ordered a campaign against them to calm a horrified populace .
And yet , as she trained her binoculars on the familiar but spooky creatures in her yard , Haupt found aspects of the corvid family that argued for more respect .
Did you know that crows recognize human faces ?
To prove this , she writes , a researcher at the University of Washington conducted an experiment .
Volunteers who had captured and banded crows ( something crows resent ) while wearing caveman masks were cawed at and dive - bombed whenever they re-entered crow precincts .
When the same volunteers walked through the crow zone with their faces hidden by Dick Cheney masks , “ the crows left them entirely alone . ”
( Presumably , this reflected no political bias . )
Affectingly , Haupt describes “ crow funerals ” in which a “ stillness ” settles around a deceased bird as other crows “ cluster about the crow in perfect silence , ” and records evidence of crows at play — basking in the sun , “ sprawled on one side with their wings hanging open . . . like black - feathered Madame Bovarys ” or catching falling cherry blossoms .
She knows that by publishing such observations , she risks criticism from the scientific community : studies “ must not resort to anecdote ” or “ anthropomorphize their subject , ” she scolds herself .
And yet , she maintains , she can’t faithfully portray the interlaced world of man and crow without sharing such stories .
She prefers the more open - minded , questing inquiry of earlier students of the natural world like Thoreau and Louis Agassiz , and patterns her own research technique on St. Benedict ’s thoughtful reading practice , allowing a “ contemplative flow ” to settle upon her watching .
Like human beings ,
Haupt explains , crows are one of the “ few prominent , dominant , successful species ” that prosper in the modern world .
Their hardiness means they will outlast more fragile ­species .
Before we revile them , she suggests , we ought to understand that there are so many of them because there are so many of us .
Because we have built , they have come , and crows and humans today must coexist in the “ zoöpolis , ” the “ overlap of human and animal geographies . ”

Rick�s Picks Thursday , August 27 , 2009 � Phenomenally accurate forecasts �
There was discouraging news yesterday for anyone hoping that Rep. Ron Paul�s bill to abolish the Federal Reserve might make it to the floor during the current Congressional session .
The way things look right now , H.R. 2755 may not come up for a vote for quite a while � at least for the duration of Mr. Obama�s presidency .
By nominating � Helicopter Ben� Bernanke to a second term , the President made clear that the political champions of a so - far catastrophically unsuccessful status quo will continue to rule our economic lives , at least for the foreseeable future .
If that weren�t bad enough , Mr. Bernanke�s �success � is likely to be judged on the basis of how well he sustains the flow of easy credit in an economy on the verge of being crushed to death by debt .
The reasoning behind Mr. Obama�s choice was made clear in the lead story in yesterday�s Wall Street Journal .
The headline , � Calm in Crisis Won Fed Job , � suggests that the President was understandably reluctant to rock the boat , presumably by appointing Larry Summers , the only other guy who had been mentioned as a serious contender for the job .
A second headline was more telling , however : � Next Term Could Be Tense if Rates Rise� .
Imagine being appointed to the most powerful position in the banking world , only to be told that your main responsibility would be to hold interest rates down .
It is a benighted political class that would demand such a thing , of course , and an economically unenlightened populace that would come to rely on it , as we surely have .
Crazy Eddy
If holding rates down is Bernanke�s main job , perhaps a separate czar should be appointed to goad us into borrowing and spending the excess cash that lower rates could produce .
That would spare the Fed chairman the unseemliness of having to tell us that buying cars , refrigerators and big - screen television sets , and bidding up home prices , is going to restore America to economic health , never mind greatness .
We can think of a few candidates for the job : Crazy Eddy , of consumer electronics notoriety ; George Zimmer , CEO of The Men�s Wearhouse ; and John Elway , Denver�s # 1 used - car salesman .
In another era , the government might have exhorted us to buy the equivalent of war bonds .
Now , though , the idea of forced saving is unthinkable , since nothing could be more deflationary .
Not that anyone would actually buy a low - coupon bond these days as an investment in America �s future .
That is not what is selling Treasury paper any more , although we are hard - pressed to say exactly what is .

The Advocate a premiere LGBT news magazine has come under pressure from trans activists and allies after it referred to a couple who were legally married in New York as a " same - sex " couple .
In the article N.Y. Unwittingly Marries " Same - Sex " Couple , the couple Hakim Nelson and Jason Stenson were given a marriage license because the clerk was unaware of the birth gender of Nelson who now goes by Kimah .
The Advocate referred to this historic story as " New York 's first legal same - sex marriage " but the problem is that neither Kimah nor Jason identify as gay .
Jason identifies as straight and Kimah is a trans woman .
Kimah hopes to undergo sex re-assignment surgery in the future , but regardless of her current status as pre , post or non-op we must be sensitive to the gender pronouns she chooses for herself .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A U.S. Senate panel dismissed ethics charges against two powerful Democrats Friday but said the lawmakers should have exercised greater care in their personal dealings with Countrywide Financial Corp .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
Senators Chris Dodd and Kent Conrad committed no ethical violations in obtaining loans from the troubled mortgage lender , the Ethics Committee said after a year - long probe .
But in letters to the two , the committee -- composed of three Democrats and three Republicans -- added that they should have “ exercised more vigilance in order to avoid the appearance that you were receiving preferential treatment . ”
Dodd , chairman of the Banking Committee , and Conrad , chairman of the Budget Committee , refinanced properties as members of Countrywide ’s VIP program .
Dodd led an effort this year to win Senate approval of a $ 300 billion housing rescue bill to help thousands of American homeowners facing foreclosure on their home loans .
Dodd told reporters earlier this year he did not think he was getting any special deal when told in 2003 that he had been placed in a VIP program while refinancing two home mortgages with Countrywide .
Countrywide , which became a symbol of some of the worst excesses of the subprime mortgage crisis , was bought by Bank of America last year for $ 2.5 billion .
Conrad also had denied any wrongdoing and said he welcomed the ethics investigation prompted by a complaint from a citizens watchdog group .
In a statement Friday after being cleared , Conrad said : “ This is most welcome news .
The Ethics Committee ’s exhaustive inquiry confirms what I have said all along : I did not ask for or receive any preferential pricing on my loans . ”
“ While I should have shown more vigilance in the appearance of these transactions , the committee has concluded I did nothing unethical , and that is the truth , ” Conrad said .
Dodd , who polls show has been hurt politically by the matter in his bid for re-election next year , scheduled a news conference for later in the day to offer his response .
Citizens For Responsibility and Ethics in Washington , which filed the complaint , mocked the panel ’s conclusions .
“ The Senate Ethics Committee has cleared the senators of any wrongdoing despite the fact that the senators participated in a program the committee found ‘ offered quicker , more efficient loan processing and some discounts , ’ ” said Melanie Sloan , head of the group .
“ Like a battered woman who explains she brought the beating on herself , the committee faulted itself for failing to ‘ provide more guidance to the Senate community about issues surrounding mortgage negotiations , ’ ” Sloan said .
“ Now would be a good time for the committee to start proactively providing its promised advice , ” she said .
The first sign of trouble came when the Eagle was five minutes into its descent , 33,500 ft above the Moon 's surface .
A shrill alarm rang through the cramped , seatless cabin in which two astronauts stood facing the stars .
An error message flashed up on their primitive computer 's tiny read - out : " 1202 " .
Neither Neil Armstrong nor Buzz Aldrin knew what it meant .
It was left to Steve Bales , a 26 - year - old technician at Mission Control in Houston to decide they should keep going .
The error , he was fairly sure , would fix itself , and he repeatedly called " Go ! " as the alarm sounded four more times .
Armstrong later said it was the computer glitch that kept him from dealing with a much more serious problem : when the descent had begun , before they rolled so they were face up , the Apollo 11 astronauts had noticed they were passing landmarks four seconds early .
After the lunar module rocked forward , to point the engine nozzle straight down to feather their descent , they should have been able to see their smooth , flat landing site in the Sea of Tranquillity below .
But Armstrong recognised nothing when he looked out of his window ; the autopilot had taken them four miles beyond their target .
" We were landing just short of a large crater with very large rocks covering a high percentage of the surface , " he recalled .
Ten minutes after beginning their descent from orbit , at an altitude of 500ft , Armstrong switched to manual control .
His heart rate leapt from 77 bpm to 156 bpm as he set the engine to hover and sought a safe place to touch down .
To his right , Aldrin called out their altitude , rate of descent and forward speed , his hand never far from the button that would explosively abort the landing .
Then he added a number : " 90 seconds " – the time until their landing fuel ran out .
Finally , among the rubble ejected from the crater by a meteor impact millions of years ago , the mission commander saw a gap .
Tilting the lunar module , they drifted to port .

At Mission Control , Gene Kranz , the flight director , turned to Charlie Duke , the astronaut charged with communicating with the crew .
" Better remind them there ain't no damn gas stations on the Moon , " he said .
Duke 's warning was more concise : " 30 seconds . "
Aldrin 's tense voice crackled back : " Light 's on , " referring to the low fuel signal .
" Thirty feet ...
Kicking up some dust ...
Faint shadow ... Contact light . "
They were down , with just enough fuel left for 16 seconds of flight – less than the time it took you to read this paragraph .
For a 10 - year - old boy , nervously fidgeting around his living - room , confirmation came from Armstrong : " Houston , Tranquillity Base here .
The Eagle has landed . "
It was 8.17 pm GMT on 20 July 1969 .
I remember whooping and jumping on and off the sofa in a scene much like the one at Mission Control .
The 12 - minute descent had been an agony of suspense .
There had been no pictures of the descent to watch , and between the distortion of the communications and the technical jargon , the astronaut 's funny accents had conveyed no meaning .
I knew nothing then about how close my heroes had come to disaster .
The computer alarm was later blamed on a radar dish which had been left switched on , overloading the tiny computer .
( Your mobile phone is about a million times more powerful . )
The navigational error was caused by " masscons " – the Moon , like the Earth , is less than perfectly spherical , so its gravity fluctuates as you fly over it .
Mass concentrations had pulled the Eagle into a slightly lower orbit , speeding it up , and it was already going at more than one mile a second .
What I did know about Apollo 11 was still pretty impressive for a 10 - year - old .
I knew , for example , that the 363ft Saturn V rocket was one foot shorter than the dome on St Paul 's Cathedral .
I knew the velocity required to escape the Earth 's gravity ( seven miles per second ) , the distance to the Moon ( 239,000 miles ) and the time lag as radio signals travelled there and back ( three seconds ) .
Years before the word was invented , I was a geek – a space geek .
I knew that the age I was growing up in was neither Modern nor Atomic , nor Post - War .
It was the Space Age , and the arrival of men on the Moon , even if they were , disappointingly , not British , was its defining moment .
By the time I was an adult , I knew lunar trips would be as routine as taking a jumbo jet from London to New York .
So the past 40 years have been a bit of a letdown , a point I tactfully made to David Scott , commander of Apollo 15 , when he visited London last month to open a new ride at the Science Museum .
Where was Moon Base One , I demanded .
Why could n't I just buy a ticket on the internet for a discount break on a space station ?
" We made it look too easy , " said Scott , the seventh of 12 men to walk on the Moon .
" Put it in perspective , " he said , comparing the Apollo missions to the gradual discovery of the Americas .
" Columbus has just returned but Cabot and Magellan have not yet made their voyages .
And Cook has n't even been born . "
He 's right about Captain James Cook , but John Cabot and Ferdinand Magellan both sailed within 40 years of Columbus .
I 'm not about to argue .
Aged 77 , Scott is still a commanding figure , tall with a distinguished head of grey hair .
He flew with Armstrong in Gemini 8 and was the command module pilot in Apollo 9 .
On his lapel he wears a gold astronaut 's pin , a shooting star rising to orbit on three streaks .
He must have heard the same questions 1,000 times , yet he answers patiently .
Moon rocks feel as though they 're made from Styrofoam , he tells one young lad .
To me , he describes flying the lunar module as " like trying to run on an ice - covered pond and turn without skates .
It 's more difficult than any plane I ever flew , " he says .
" You ' zone ' like an Olympic athlete .
You 're totally focused . "
Then the former test pilot thinks of a better metaphor : " It 's like riding a pogo stick on a trampoline . "

Our nearest neighbour was hurtling around Earth once every 27 days , seven hours and 43 minutes long before man evolved .
It governs the tides , illuminates the night and provides a convenient measure of time between the day and the year .
The Greeks believed in Hecate , a three - faced goddess who transformed into Artemis as the satellite waxed and then into Selene when it was full .
Plutarch told of cave - dwelling Moon demons .
Johannes Kepler wrote that its craters were built by Moon creatures .
And as recently as the 1920s , the American astronomer William Pickering thought it might have insects .
The superstitious believed sleeping in moonbeams would drive one crazy and werewolves transformed from men into monsters by its light .
In A Midsummer Night 's Dream , Shakespeare called the crescent moon " a silver bow new - bent in heaven " ; Shelley described it in " The Cloud " as " that orbed maiden with white fire laden " .
So enamoured were poets and lyricists , particularly bad ones , that by the early 20th century , rhymes with " spoon " and " June " were the worst of clichés .
The first recorded story of a trip to the Moon was a satirical piece by the Syrian writer Lucian of Samosata during the 2nd century AD , who had his hero sucked up in a water spout .
In the 1600s , Cyrano de Bergerac imagined being lifted to the Moon by bottles of dew .
Two centuries later , Jules Verne fired his crew off from a huge cannon , while in 1901 HG Wells invented anti-gravity .
And in 1950 , Hergé , Tintin 's author , launched the young reporter and Captain Haddock in a ship that looked suspiciously like a German V2 rocket .
They were all wrong – but Hergé came closest .
Wernher von Braun conducted his first rocket experiment in 1924 by attaching fireworks to his sister 's red wagon and setting it off in a busy Berlin street .
The police arrested him .
By the time he reached university , his love of astronomy and things that go bang was firmly established .
He joined the Verein für Raumschiffahrt , an amateur spaceflight society , and was writing his doctorate when the Nazis came to power in 1933 .
Von Braun 's connection with the Nazis is controversial .
He built weapons for Hitler , notably the V2 , joined the SS and employed slave labourers at his factories .
( More people died building the V2s than were killed when they landed on London . )
But he was also suspected of being a Communist and was arrested for defeatism .
He was one of those obsessed people who believe their work is more important than anything around them .
His comment when the first V2 exploded in London is revealing : " The rocket worked perfectly except for landing on the wrong planet . "
At the end of the Second World War , Von Braun and his team arranged to be captured by the Americans and were sent to the US under Operation Paperclip .
Eventually , he would build every major US rocket up to the Saturn V . But at first , Washington was uninterested .
Then the Soviet space programme scored a series of triumphs : the first artificial satellite ( 1957 ) , the first animal in space ( 1957 ) , the first unmanned Moon mission ( 1959 ) , the first man in space ( 1961 ) and the first woman ( 1963 ) .
The space race had begun , and America was losing .
It does n't take a cynic to appreciate the significance of Cold War politics on the Apollo programme .
The ascendancy of the free market is clear now , but in the 1960s , central planning still seemed viable .
The space race looked like a reasonable way to determine which system , capitalist or Communist , was superior , though so many factors were involved , including blind luck , that it could have gone either way .
President Dwight Eisenhower had been caught napping by Sputnik , a fact John Kennedy used in his 1960 campaign .
But once in power , Kennedy seemed distracted by the Communist threat .
Influential advisers argued that the US should cede space to the Soviets and get on with earthly business .
Many space scientists wanted to concentrate on unmanned exploration , which offered richer rewards at lower cost .
Yet Kennedy 's hand was forced by the April 1961 flight of Yuri Gagarin in Vostok 1 and the Bay of Pigs fiasco five days later .
The president had promised an army of Cuban exiles air support for their invasion , but failed to deliver .
Survivors bitterly denounced his treachery , and his standing with the American public hit a record low .
Desperate for a distraction , he called on vice president Lyndon Johnson .
" Do we have a chance of beating the Soviets by putting up a laboratory in space ? " he asked .
" Or by a trip around the Moon , or by a rocket to go to the Moon and back with a man ? "
The mission did n't matter ; all that counted was beating the Russians .
In a speech to Congress a month later , Kennedy announced : " This nation should commit itself to achieving the goal , before this decade is out , of landing a man on the Moon and returning him back safely to the Earth . "
America was back in the running .
' Apollo 1 ' sat atop a Saturn 1B rocket at Cape Kennedy on 27 January 1967 while its three member - crew went through a tedious five - hour systems check .
The atmosphere inside the command module was pressurised pure oxygen .
Political pressure was also high ; president Johnson wanted an Apollo success to boost his re-election chances .
But the command module had been plagued by 20,000 failures , and condemned as " sloppy and unsafe " by a quality - control inspector .
Early in the test , the astronauts complained of a sour odour , and static was breaking into their communications .
At 6.31 pm , something sparked .
" I 've got a fire in the cockpit , " reported mission commander Gus Grissom .
" Fire ! " shouted Roger Chafee .
Then came a garbled , " Get us out ! " possibly from Ed White .
In the pure - oxygen atmosphere , almost everything was inflammable .
Metal pipes bubbled and dripped , joints melted , cooling lines burst , spraying burning fluid like a blowtorch .
The foam cushions on the floor burst into a wall of flame between the crew and the exit .
The hatch took 90 seconds to open in ideal circumstances .
The crew of Apollo 1 died in 8.5 seconds .
The fatal fire could have brought the programme to a halt , or slowed it so much that the Soviets won .
For the first time , public debate turned to whether the huge sums ( $ 25 bn in 1965 dollars , about £ 100 bn today ) being spent on a Moon shot were worthwhile .
An internal investigation was never able to find the point of ignition , listing 10 possible sources .
Poor management , carelessness , negligence and failure to consider safety were highlighted .
Management at Nasa and the command - module contractor , North American , now part of Boeing , were overhauled .
Half - a- billion dollars was spent on redesigning Apollo .
Chris Kraft , one of the flight directors , said later : " It was unforgiveable that we allowed that accident to happen .
[ But ] had it not happened , we probably would not have got to the Moon when we did . "
The Russians had not been idle meanwhile , but they had been unlucky .
Their first plan was to launch a " direct ascent " mission , with a single vehicle going all the way to the Moon and back .
But their massive N - 1 rocket was delayed .
Under a second plan , " Earth orbit rendezvous " , several smaller rockets would dock in orbit , then head to the Moon .
But the first ship in the flotilla , Soyuz 1 , crashed , killing cosmonaut Vladimir Komarov .
A compromise mission , Zond , was devised to send a reduced crew to orbit the Moon and return without landing .
Moscow dithered , however , and Nasa swapped its mission plans for Apollos 8 and 9 , getting a crew into lunar orbit first .
In 1968 , Americans were treated to a Christmas Eve broadcast from the Moon .
Mission commander Frank Borman looked back at the Earth , calling it " a grand oasis in the vastness of space " .
Nasa 's plan was to employ a technique known as " lunar orbit rendezvous " , in which a two - part lunar module goes to the surface , and the top section blasts off to rejoin the orbiting command module , transferring the astronauts and samples .
The command module then heads for Earth .
After Apollo 9 practised docking manoeuvres between lander and command module above the Earth , Apollo 10 returned to the Moon , dropping its lander to within nine miles of the surface .
( That command module is in the Science Museum in London . )
In February 1969 , the Soviet N - 1 rocket was at last ready , but it exploded on its first unmanned flight .
The Russians were all but beaten .
They made one last attempt – a smaller , unmanned mission that would return rock samples to Earth – but it , too , crashed .
Only the Americans were left in the race .
Half - a- million people crowded the roads and waterways around Cape Kennedy to watch the launch on 16 July of Apollo 11 and an estimated half - a- billion saw it on television .
" It was awe - inspiring , " recalls Dr Allan Needell , curator of the space - history division at the Smithsonian 's National Air and Space Museum in Washington .
" There was a lot of tension in the US over civil rights and the war in Vietnam back then .
Apollo 11 overcame some of that strife and conflict .
There was a great sense of human accomplishment . "
Even a small band of protesters who felt Nasa 's money could be better spent reducing poverty ended up appreciating Nasa 's point of view after being given ringside seats to the launch of Armstrong , Aldrin and the command - module pilot , Michael Collins .
Neil Armstrong never quite matched the image of the first man to walk on the Moon .
" How long must it take , " he demanded in 1976 , " before I cease to be known as a spaceman ? "
Unlike many other astronauts , he never jumped on Nasa 's publicity bandwagon .
" He was a bit of a recluse even before the mission , " says Dr Needell .
" He 's a respected member of the astronaut corps , very knowledgeable .
But he has never readily accepted the role of public icon . "
If Armstrong were to be remembered for anything else , it would be as an aeronautical engineer .
The son of a state civil servant posted to Wapakoneta , Ohio , he enrolled in the Navy to fund his education at Purdue University .
His experience as a pilot in the Korean War helped further his understanding of aircraft , but only after he graduated did he think of becoming a test pilot , and from there of joining the astronaut programme .
Nasa is said to have been divided about whether Armstrong or Aldrin should be the first to set foot on the Moon .
In the end , the mission commander got the honour ... then flubbed his lines .
He intended to say , " One small step for [ a ] man , one giant leap for mankind , " but left out the definite article , turning it into a tautology .
Aldrin 's most memorable quote came shortly after he joined Armstrong on the surface : " Magnificent desolation . "
For the two spacemen , the point of the mission was to get to the Moon and return safely .
Science was not their top priority , nor was putting up flags or taking pictures .
But they did collect samples , and more were added on the five subsequent missions .
In all , some 382 kg of Moon rocks were returned to Earth .
Two fragments are housed in the Natural History Museum in London : a blackened chunk of anorthosite breccia , a calcium - rich feldspar , brought back by Apollo 16 , and a volcanic basalt gathered by the Apollo 17 astronauts .
What started out as a political , Cold War race ended up adding substantially to human knowledge , says Tom Watters , senior scientist at the Center for Earth and Planetary Studies at the National Air and Space Museum .
Before Apollo , the Moon was thought to have originated either as a passing planetoid captured by Earth 's gravity or by condensing out of the same primordial dust cloud as the Earth .
Thanks to evidence including the Apollo rocks , the consensus today is that a Mars - size planet slammed into the early Earth , throwing up a cloud of debris that coalesced into the Moon .
A new space race is shaping up , though the competition will be far less intense than it was 40 years ago .
The US plans a return to the Moon , while China , India and Japan are each preparing for manned missions .
If they succeed , they will add substantially to our knowledge .
Dr Watters is hopeful , for example , that additional seismometers will help locate the sources of the small quakes detected by instruments left by the Apollo missions .
It is not yet clear whether these are from unseen impacts or tectonic processes .
And little is known about the far side of the Moon .
For the 10 - year - old space geek in me , this flurry of activity also holds out hope .
One day , probably too late for me admittedly , someone will build a permanent Moon Base One .
And then the Space Age will really start to reach for the stars .
Buzz Aldrin 's memoir ' Magnificent Desolation ' ( Bloomsbury , £ 16.99 ) is out now .

At least 219 people have been executed in the Islamic republic so far this year , nearly as many as the 246 who faced the death penalty in 2008 .
China executed some 5,000 people last year , according to some estimates , more than the rest of the world combined .
The wonder years
The golden age of baseball ?
It 's not when you think .
This column appears in the June 29 issue of ESPN The Magazine .
We 're going with a one - question mailbag this week , courtesy of Phil D. from Montclair , N.J. : " What was the purest baseball era , from a statistical perspective ? "
Honestly , Phil ?
That 's like asking , " Who 's the purest actress in an X - rated movie ? "
Every baseball era has been tainted to some degree .
But if there is no era , maybe we can find a window .
A four - or five - year stretch will do .
Two years , even .
Hell , I 'll settle for an All - Star break .
Okay , let 's begin .
I 'm dismissing the following eras for being either impure , antiquated or uniquely ludicrous :
The 1800s : Please .
They would n't even let those guys play in Ray Kinsella 's cornfield .
1900 - 1919 : Pitchers threw 300 to 400 innings a season .
Some outfields did n't have fences .
They used the same ball over and over ; by the seventh inning , it looked like Mickey Rourke 's face .
Teams hit a home run every five or six games .
Fielders left their gloves on the field between innings .
Minorities could n't play .
Come on .
Courtesy Topps
The Red Sox were n't integrated until 1959 , with the arrival of Pumpsie Green .
1920 - 1946 : Once Babe Ruth ushered in the long ball era , teams averaged five - plus runs a game , and ERAs soared to Chien - Ming Wangesque heights .
Also , the concept of the bullpen had n't been thought through .
And WWII hijacked so many players that the 1945 Browns started a one - armed outfielder , leading to 45,000 " old Pete Gray is just lending them a hand " jokes that summer .
Minorities were still banned .
No thanks .
1947 -1959 : Jackie Robinson finally integrated baseball … but it did n't exactly become the U.N.
Most teams had one or two minority players , tops .
The Red Sox did n't start their first black guy until 1959 -- and his name was Pumpsie .
Still not buying it .
1960 - 1968 : The pitching era kicked in , and it was not good .
Both leagues ' ERAs dropped below 3.00 by 1968 , the year Bob Gibson gave up 38 earned runs total in 304 2/3 innings .
The mound was lowered to 10 inches in 1969 to generate offense .
It 's hard to think " pure " when the sport is still tinkering with basic rules , right ?
1969 - 1976 : The sport began to assume its current form -- all kinds of ethnicities and offensive players ( speed guys , power guys , you name it ) ; the dawn of semimodern closers , like Rollie Fingers ; teams , like the Big Red Machine , that valued OBP as much as power and speed ; even a first taste of overpaid stars mailing in seasons with Bobby Bonds and Richie ( a.k.a. Dick ) Allen .
But I have issues with this time , too .
Managers foolishly affected games with too much hit - and - run and too many reckless steals .
Leadoff hitters were chosen for speed , not an ability to get on base .
There was still no real bullpen specialization , and the power numbers were n't quite there either .
Starters threw too many innings ( poor Catfish Hunter 's arm ) .
Closers were routinely burned out by pitching 125 to 150 innings .
Too many artificial turf stadiums rewarded double / triple guys and slap hitters and wore down everyday players .
This is not a polished enough era for my taste -- although the Afros and sideburns were sublime .
1977 - 1987 : All those manager / park / bullpen / style issues from the previous era were still in play ( although to a lesser extent ) , but you could have convinced me about this span if not for a cocaine craze that affected Hollywood , music , arts , sports and any other industry in which people had disposable cash and nostrils .
I 'd say we were operating at 74 % capacity of creative / athletic excellence then .
I mean , it took nine years for guys to realize that maybe freebasing right before a doubleheader was n't the best idea .
You should n't have to rob that many convenience stores for coke money before you know you need to cut back a little .
How many careers were affected or compromised ?
And how do we know there were n't PEDs back then ?
Bodybuilders , Eastern European Olympians and even some NFL players were ' roiding as far back as the late '60s .
Some of our favorite action heroes were using PEDs by the early ' 80s ( most famously , Sly and Arnold ) .
Even professional wrestling ( I know , I know , it 's hard to believe ) was compromised .
Are we so sure this crap did n't needle its way into baseball sooner than the Canseco era ?
In the American League , homers jumped from 0.58 to 0.89 per game ( per team ) in 1977 and topped 1.0 in ' 86 and ' 87 .
And it 's not like a few weird things did n't happen .
For instance , Darrell Evans topped 20 homers just once from 1976 to 1984 ; then , at age 38 , he belted 40 .
Is that less strange than Brady Anderson 's famous 50 ?
And let us not forget that when offense jumped so dramatically in ' 87 we all came to the same conclusion : " The ball is juiced . "
How else could Wade Boggs hit 24 homers ?
Why else would the AL's OPS reach a postwar / pre-PEDs peak of .759 ?
Did they juice balls to distract everyone from an ugly winter of owner collusion ?
I say yes , absolutely .
Just a little too much weirdness in this era for my liking .
1993 -2009 : No need to cry over spilled testosterone .
That leaves a five - year period , 1988 - 1992 , that now seems Jonas - level pure , after the fact .
Cocaine had become passé , and the number of suspicious statistical guys -- we could create the word " ' roidy " here , just for kicks -- was a handful , at best .
Er , worst .
They clearly did n't damage the game any more than the spitballers , scuffers and corked - bat guys of earlier eras .

A one - legged Kirk Gibson defines what could be baseball 's purest era .
Combined , both leagues averaged a .702 OPS , a 3.79 ERA and 4.19 runs per game .
There had been only 15 36 - plus home run performances in the five seasons prior to 1993 ; by 1999 , I think everyone in the majors had at least 36 , except Luis Sojo .
Quality starters threw between 220 and 260 innings , only 24 pitchers won 20 - plus games , and Dennis Eckersley and Bobby Thigpen ushered in the reign of one - inning closers .
Maybe recklessness on the basepaths had n't slowed , and maybe every team had n't fully embraced OPS and defense .
But everything else was in place .
It certainly was an unpredictable group of seasons .
In a good way .
The 1988 Dodgers were the worst on - paper champs of my lifetime : Basically , they won with Orel Hershiser , a one - legged Kirk Gibson and a couple of decent pitchers named Tim .
It remains amazing .
The scrappy 1990 Reds shocked Canseco and the heavily favored A's .
The 1991 World Series ranks among the best ever , Kirby Puckett and Jack Morris willing the Twins to a crown .
And the ' 92 playoffs feature one of my favorite rewatchable baseball moments : Atlanta 's Francisco Cabrera slapping a do - or - die single into left field in the climactic NLCS game , Sid Bream chugging around third like an 18 - wheeler , Pirate Barry Bonds whipping a slightly off - the - mark throw home , pudgy Mike LaValliere blocking the plate and almost making the tag and CBS '
Sean McDonough yelping , " Saaaaaafe ! "
It 's fantastic .
It 's the best .
I would argue it 's the last great , completely untainted I - ca n 't - come - up - with - a - single - way - to - denigrate - this baseball moment .
That it includes a spindly , normal - headed Bonds almost seems fitting .
So that 's my answer , Phil : 1988 - 1992 .
And for even more symbolism than Bonds ' head , remember this : Game 3 of the 1989 World Series was postponed by a frightening earthquake just after batting practice .
One of the Bay Area 's deadliest quakes in years interrupting the only Bay Area World Series ever ?
The odds are unfathomable .
On the other hand , can you think of a more logical time for a natural disaster to hit than the purest era in baseball history ?
I rest my case .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The Obama administration will raise its 10 - year budget deficit projection to approximately $ 9 trillion from $ 7.108 trillion in a report next week , a senior administration official told Reuters on Friday .

The higher deficit figure , based on updated economic data , brings the White House budget office into line with outside estimates and gives further fuel to President Barack Obama ’s opponents , who say his spending plans are too expensive in light of budget shortfalls .
The White House took heat for sticking with its $ 7.108 trillion forecast earlier this year after the Congressional Budget Office forecast that deficits between 2010 and 2019 would total $ 9.1 trillion .
“ The new forecasts are based on new data that reflect how severe the economic downturn was in the late fall of last year and the winter of this year , ” said the administration official , who is familiar with the budget mid-session review that is slated to be released next week .
“ Our budget projections are now in line with the spring and summer projections that the Congressional Budget Office put out . ”
The White House budget office will also lower its deficit forecast for this fiscal year , which ends September 30 , to $ 1.58 trillion from $ 1.84 trillion next week after removing $ 250 billion set aside for bank bailouts .
Record - breaking deficits have raised concerns about America ’s ability to finance its debt and whether the United States can maintain its top - tier AAA credit rating .
Politically , the deficit has been an albatross for Obama , a Democrat who is pushing forward with plans to overhaul the U.S. healthcare industry -- an initiative that could cost up to $ 1 trillion over 10 years -- and other promises , including reforming education and how the country handles energy .
DEFICIT WORRIES
Republicans have pounced on Obama for planning to spend too much when deficits are so high , and the issue is likely to loom large in next year ’s Congressional elections .
Obama , who has promised to halve the deficit by the end of his four - year term and likes to remind constituents he inherited a $ 1.3 trillion deficit from former President George W. Bush , says bringing down healthcare costs is critical to long - term deficit reduction .
Treasury markets have been worried all year about the mounting deficit .
The United States relies on large foreign buyers such as China and Japan to cheaply finance its debt , and they may demand higher interest rates if they begin to doubt that the government can control its deficits .
“ It ’s one of those underlying pieces of news that is liable to haunt the bond market at some point in the future , ” said Kim Rupert , managing director of global fixed income analysis at Action Economics LLC in San Francisco , referring to the revised 10 - year deficit projection .
Many economists think it is unlikely the government can curtail spending , which means taxes would have to go up to cover the rising costs of providing retirement and healthcare benefits to aging Americans .
Higher taxes , which could slow economic growth , are also a major concern of voters on both sides of the political divide .
Obama has promised not to raise taxes on Americans making less than $ 250,000 a year .
PSP Gets You Mysty Eyed
by David ' Hades ' Becker [ Tuesday , 14th of July 2009 - 10:13 PM ]
Some interesting news for this week 's PSN releases .
It looks like this week PSP owners will have a chance to download and play the popular PC puzzler Myst on their PSPs .
Play it with out having to mod or hack the system to get it on there to boot .
If you have n't already or picked up the title for your iPhone or other application ready system .
Something interesting about this is that it is slated to be the original game as the PC , except that it will include the stuff that was cut from the original release .
Yes that sounds backwards .
But they did n't want to go the Resident Evil route and place Director 's Cut on the title I guess .
But I guess that 's acceptable .
No word on price for the game yet .
But we can assume $ 9.99 for it as that seems the standard .
But we can sit well knowing that this sleeper has been confirmed for download this Thursday .
Oh , and below are a few shots of the game on the system in all it 's nostalgic glory .
“ Cash for Clunkers ” is being called a great success .
Politicians are scrambling to fund an expansion of this program .
Let 's do a little math and see if we can agree .
The reports have been rolling in and we have heard repeatedly that showrooms were filled with people looking for new cars because of the “ Cash for Clunkers ” program .
The Senate is working hard to fund this program for a whole month .
They desperately need to tie themselves to a successful , popular program .
My non-scientific drive by of the dealerships near my home last weekend left me a bit suspicious .
I saw no unusual activity .
They did not even look busy .
I saw few customers walking around the lots .
So , let 's look at the numbers .
According to government reports 157,000 rebate applications for the “ Cash for Clunkers ” program have been received .
To most folks that would seem like a large number .
Showrooms must be standing room only , right ?
Consider this :
There are 3,140 counties and parishes in the United States .
If this program has been going for 14 days , then that works out to an amazing 3.57 cars per county per day .
Wow .
Can you feel how much cleaner the air is ?
Have you seen all the “ License Applied For ” tags on your daily commute ?
Perhaps some counties have no dealerships at all .
Certainly a possibility .
But right down the street from where I live there are at least 8 .
There are at least 15 in the county that I can think of off the top of my head .
Suffice it to say I am having a difficult time buying the hype on what a grand and successful program this is .
Frankly , this is BS .
We have lost touch with reality in this country when it comes to numbers , impacts , and outcomes .
We need more people to start doing a little math before we call something a success .
We have a large country , people .
What seems like a large number at first is generally not so large when you break it down by county , something most of us can relate to .
Would you even notice the new cars in your county ?
Were “ Cash for Clunkers ” to be really successful as it has been described to us , perhaps 30 cars per county per day would be a starting point to describe success .
But we cannot afford such a plan can we ?
That would be 10 times what we have spent so far .
The Wall Street Journal is now reporting that lean inventories imperil car sales .
Sorry , I am not buying it .
This seems more like an attempt to create panic buying before your model is gone .
Three and 1 /2 cars per day per county and there is no more inventory ?
I know salesmen that used to sell that many cars per day .
That 's my opinion .
So do the math , and then tell me yours .

The so - called pro-life movement in a nutshell :
Supporters of the right to legal abortion worried Monday that the killing of George Tiller in his Wichita church could foretell fresh protests and violence even as many abortion opponents fretted that his death could hurt their image and cause .
Advertisements
On his MSNBC program Countdown host Keith Olbermann laid the responsibility for the murder of Dr. George Tiller at the feet of Bill O’Reilly and Fox News .
Olbermann said that Fox News incites murder and terrorism , and must be stopped .
Here is the video :
Advertisements
Olbermann proposed an indirect boycott of Fox News , “ If there is a solution it is perhaps an indirect boycott .
It is probably your experience as it has been mine that stores , bars , restaurants , waiting rooms often show Fox News on their televisions .
Do n’t write a letter , make a threat , just get up and explain if they will not change the channel leave the place and say calmly why it is you are taking your business elsewhere . ”
Olberman later claimed that FNC incites murder and terrorism , “ Fox News Channel will never restrain itself from incitement of murder and terrorism not until its profits begin to decline , when its growth stops , so not so much a boycott here as a quarantine , because this has got to stop …
The goal here is to get this blindly irresponsible man and his ilk off the air .
We are only in the television news business , a profession that is at times about two inches up from carnival barking .
We must again separate it , television , from terrorism , and we must again make the world safe for people condemned by the Fox News Channel . ”
I think that Keith Olbermann has finally lost his mind .
He is so caught up in his war with Bill O’Reilly and Fox News that he is missing the big picture here .
This is not about Keith Olbermann vs. Fox News .
I think that his rhetoric about FNC inciting murder and terrorism was way over the top .
Olbermann complains about how O’Reilly tries to censor free speech , but is n’t he doing the same thing by trying to get O’Reilly taken off of the air ?
The problem is that there are people in our society who murder in the name of life , not that an idiot on FNC plays to the extremist crowd .
Olbermann is attributing responsibility when he does n’t have any proof .
If I watch MSNBC , then go shoot a Republican , does this mean that Keith Olbermann is to blame ?
I think that Olbermann has become what he claims to hate the most .
In my opinion , Keith Olbermann has become the left wing version of Bill O’Reilly .
He is the liberal Coyote to the O’Reilly ’s conservative Road Runner .
Both of them are cartoon characters who have descended into self parody , and both of them are ignoring the real reason why we all should be appalled over the murder of Dr. George Tiller .
On 2 August 2009 , after cordoning off part of the Arab neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah in east Jerusalem , Israeli police evicted two Palestinian families ( more than 50 people ) from their homes ; Jewish settlers immediately moved into the emptied houses .
Although Israeli police cited a ruling by the country 's supreme court , the evicted Arab families had been living there for more than 50 years .
The event – which , rather exceptionally , did attract the attention of the world media – is part of a much larger and mostly ignored ongoing process .
Five months earlier , on 1 March , it had been reported that the Israeli government had drafted plans to build more than 70,000 new homes in Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank ; if implemented , the plans could increase the number of settlers in the Palestinian territories by about 300,000
Such a move would not only severely undermine the chances of a viable Palestinian state , but also hamper the everyday life of Palestinians .
A government spokesman dismissed the report , arguing that the plans were of limited relevance – the construction of homes in the settlements required the approval of the defence minister and the prime minister .
However , 15,000 have already been fully approved , and 20,000 of the proposed housing units lie in settlements that Israel cannot expect to retain in any future peace deal with the Palestinians .
The conclusion is obvious : while paying lip - service to the two - state solution , Israel is busy creating a situation on the ground that will render such a solution impossible .
The dream underlying Israel 's plans is encapsulated by a wall that separates a settler 's town from the Palestinian town on a nearby West Bank hill .
The Israeli side of the wall is painted with the image of the countryside beyond the wall – but without the Palestinian town , depicting just nature , grass and trees .
Is this not ethnic cleansing at its purest , imagining the outside beyond the wall as empty , virginal and waiting to be settled ?
On the very day that reports of the government 's 70,000 - home plan emerged , Hillary Clinton criticised the rocket fire from Gaza as " cynical " , claiming : " There is no doubt that any nation , including Israel , cannot stand idly by while its territory and people are subjected to rocket attacks . "
But should the Palestinians stand idly while the West Bank land is taken from them day by day ?
When peace - loving Israeli liberals present their conflict with Palestinians in neutral , symmetrical terms – admitting that there are extremists on both sides who reject peace – one should ask a simple question : what goes on in the Middle East when nothing is happening there at the direct politico - military level ( ie , when there are no tensions , attacks or negotiations ) ?
What goes on is the slow work of taking the land from the Palestinians on the West Bank : the gradual strangling of the Palestinian economy , the parcelling up of their land , the building of new settlements , the pressure on Palestinian farmers to make them abandon their land ( which goes from crop - burning and religious desecration to targeted killings ) – all this supported by a Kafkaesque network of legal regulations .
Saree Makdisi , in Palestine Inside Out : An Everyday Occupation , describes how , although the Israeli occupation of the West Bank is ultimately enforced by the armed forces , it is an " occupation by bureaucracy " : it works primarily through application forms , title deeds , residency papers and other permits .
It is this micro-management of the daily life that does the job of securing slow but steady Israeli expansion : one has to ask for a permit in order to leave with one 's family , to farm one 's own land , to dig a well , or to go to work , to school , or to hospital .
One by one , Palestinians born in Jerusalem are thus stripped of the right to live there , prevented from earning a living , denied housing permits , etc .
Palestinians often use the problematic cliche of the Gaza strip as " the greatest concentration camp in the world " .
However , in the past year , this designation has come dangerously close to truth .
This is the fundamental reality that makes all abstract " prayers for peace " obscene and hypocritical .
The state of Israel is clearly engaged in a slow , invisible process , ignored by the media ; one day , the world will awake and discover that there is no more Palestinian West Bank , that the land is Palestinian - free , and that we must accept the fact .
The map of the Palestinian West Bank already looks like a fragmented archipelago .
In the last months of 2008 , when the attacks of illegal West Bank settlers on Palestinian farmers became a regular daily occurrence , the state of Israel tried to contain these excesses ( the supreme court ordered the evacuation of some settlements ) but , as many observers have noted , such measures are half - hearted , countered by the long - term politics of Israel , which violates the international treaties it has signed .
The response of the illegal settlers to the Israeli authorities is " We are doing the same thing as you , just more openly , so what right do you have to condemn us ? "
And the state 's reply is basically " Be patient , and do n't rush too much .
We are doing what you want , just in a more moderate and acceptable way . "
The same story has been repeated since 1949 : Israel accepts the peace conditions proposed by the international community , counting on the fact that the peace plan will not work .
The illegal settlers sometimes sound like Brunhilde from the last act of Wagner 's Walküre – reproaching Wotan and saying that , by counteracting his explicit order and protecting Siegmund , she was only realising Wotan 's own true desire , which he was forced to renounce under external pressure .
In the same way the settlers know they are realising their own state 's true desire .
While condemning the violent excesses of " illegal " settlements , the state of Israel promotes new " legal " building on the West Bank , and continues to strangle the Palestinian economy .
A look at the changing map of East Jerusalem , where the Palestinians are gradually encircled and their living area sliced , tells it all .
The condemnation of anti-Palestinian violence not carried out by the state blurs the true problem of state violence ; the condemnation of illegal settlements blurs the illegality of the legal ones .
Therein resides the two - facedness of the much - praised non-biased " honesty " of the Israeli supreme court : by occasionally passing judgment in favour of the dispossessed Palestinians , proclaiming their eviction illegal , it guarantees the legality of the remaining majority of cases .
Taking all this into account in no way implies sympathy for inexcusable terrorist acts .
On the contrary , it provides the only ground from which one can condemn the terrorist attacks without hypocrisy .

• This article was amended on 20 August 2009 .
The online version originally referred to " Palestinian - frei " , while the print version had been edited to say " Palestinian - free " .
This editing change should have been applied to the online version .
This has now been done .
Just off the heels of a report that 45 % of employers now screen social media profiles during the hiring process is more research on corporate social media behavior .
It turns out that more and more companies are doing more than just screening - they 're also actively blocking employee access to social networking sites .
According to ScanSafe , a web security software provider , there has been a 20 % increase in the number of companies blocking social networking sites — ie .
Facebook and Twitter — in the past six months .
That research is based on more than a billion of the processed web requests that the company receives each month .
ScanSafe 's research found that , " Currently , 76 % of companies are choosing to block social networking and it is now a more popular category to block than online shopping ( 52 % ) , weapons ( 75 % ) , alcohol ( 64 % ) , sports ( 51 % ) and Webmail ( 58 % ) .
Surprisingly , employers do n’t take the same stern approach to online banking and less than half ( 47 % ) of our customers block this category . "
It 's quite possible that the rise of malicious activities , like Facebook and Twitter phishing and spam attacks , are frightening employers who may fear security breaches .
Plus , there 's always the age - old concern that allowing access to social media sites decreases workforce productivity .
Whatever the reason , it appears that even though many big brands and small businesses alike are seeing social media success , there 's still plenty of fear to go around when it comes to employers and social networking sites .

Are Your Initials Holding You Back ?
“ What ’s in a name ?
That which we call a rose
By any other name would smell as sweet . ” ~ Romeo and Juliet
In these lines from Shakespeare ’s famous play , Juliet is trying to persuade Romeo that the bitter feud between their respective families does n’t matter , that he and his surname are easily divisible , and so they can be together .
While she speaks truthfully of her own love , in questioning the power of names she is intentionally dissembling .
Clearly they do matter , a very great deal , as the tragic ending of Romeo and Juliet bears out .
In fact we are so sensitive to what things are called and the unconscious associations these generate , that our performance in a variety of arenas may be marred by something as seemingly insignificant as our own initials .
Initial problems
To test whether initials can really scupper our best intentions , psychologists Leif Nelson and Joseph Simmons went on a hunt through baseball records , grade point averages and law school admissions — even carrying out their own experiment — to search for evidence .
Publishing their results in Psychological Science , Nelson and Simmons ( 2007 ) unearthed some suggestive findings :
Baseball .
Strikeouts are recorded with the letter K in baseball ( for the sports impaired : a strikeout is a bad thing for a batter ) .
Nelson and Simmons found that across 90 years of professional baseball , players whose names — whether first or last — began with a K have been slightly more likely to strikeout than anyone else .
Academic performance .
Nelson and Simmons then looked at MBA applicants over 15 years to a large US university .
They hypothesised that people whose names began with C or D would find these grades less aversive and so strive less hard to avoid them .
And that ’s what they found : applicants whose first or last name began with a C or D had lower GPAs .
It was only a small effect , but significant across 14,000 applicants .
Law school .
The same pattern was seen in law schools : lawyers with initials of A or B were found to have attended better law schools than those with initials of C or D .
These are all correlations , though , which might be explained in all sorts of different ways .
To give us evidence that initials have a causative role in performance what we really need is an experiment .
Implicit egotism
Nelson and Simmons , therefore , gave 284 participants the chance to win a prize in an anagram competition .
The way the prizes were labelled was manipulated so that sometimes they coincided with the participants ’ initials , and sometimes not .
The experimenters predicted that participants would be unconsciously drawn towards the lesser , consolation prize , if one of their initials coincided with the prize ’s label .
Consequently they would complete fewer anagrams .
Surprisingly this is exactly what they found : people completed less anagrams ( on average 1 fewer ) when the consolation prize happened to be labelled with the first letter of their own name .
In effect , because of a simple alphabetical association , participants tried to fail .
Theorists argue there is a kind of implicit egoism at work .
We unconsciously prefer our own names because they are associated with ourselves and most people like themselves .
That this effect is n’t down to a kind of novelty - seeking is borne out by the fact that people are choosing worse outcomes .
The vast majority of people would n’t consciously choose to get a ‘ D’ , go to a poor law school , or only win the consolation prize .
This effect may well have a small but measurable influence in all sorts of situations .
One that has been investigated recently is the association between people ’s initials and their tendency to work for companies that start with the same letter .
Anseel and Duyck ( 2008 ) obtained a database containing one - third of all private sector employees in Belgium , over half a million names , then they looked at their employers ’ names .
They found as predicted that people were more likely to work for companies with initials matching their own , especially if their initials and the company ’s were unusual such as Q or Y .
Implicit egotism could well be working both ways here : not only are employees more likely to apply for jobs with companies with the same initial but employers prefer applicants that share their organisation ’s initial letter .
What ’s in an initial ?
So the answer to Juliet ’s question , “ What ’s in a name ? ” is : quite a lot .
This research suggests there ’s more than we might imagine in only an initial .
Perhaps Juliet , if she ’d lived longer than her 13 years , would have been well advised to change her family name of ‘ Capulet ’ to something more aspirational to help her application for that MBA or to get her into a decent Italian law school .

Mr Wiedeking became Porsche chief executive in 1993 German luxury car maker Porsche has said chief executive Wendelin Wiedeking and financial director Holger Haerter have resigned " with immediate effect " .
Mr Wiedeking leaves with a 50 m euros ( $ 70 m ; £ 43 m ) payoff package .
Earlier this year , Mr Wiedeking failed in his attempt for Porsche to take over larger German rival Volkswagen ( VW ) , despite building a 51 % holding in VW .
Now the way is open for VW , Europe 's biggest carmaker , to take over Porsche and add it to its brands .
The news comes as the boards of Porsche and VW hold separate meetings on the way forward .
' Reverse bid '
" The news that the Porsche chief executive is resigning is not really unexpected , " Credit Suisse automotive analyst Arndt Ellinghorst told the BBC .
He leaves a quarter of a century later a much richer man - but with the manner of his departure casting a shadow over his otherwise hugely successful career
Life and legacy of Wendelin Wiedeking " He has ... failed to take over Volkswagen , now Volkswagen is going for a reverse bid of the Porsche car business .
I think ultimately this is going to be a good outcome . "
Mr Ellinghorst pointed out that Porsche and VW have had close links since they were both founded by Ferdinand Porsche in the 1930s .
" The two companies will merge their operations and I think that this is key for their performance .
We are seeing all over the world in the auto industry the need for consolidation . "

And he said , despite the seeming diversity between Porsche and VW cars , that the two firms would be able to work together on platforms and components .
Earlier , Porsche said it would increase its capital by at least 5 bn euros ( $ 7.10 bn ; £ 4.3 bn ) .
It said that this new sum would " create the foundation of building an integrated car manufacturing group with Porsche and Volkswagen " .
Porsche 's board also endorsed negotiations for the sale of a stake to Qatar to bolster its balance sheet .
' Strategic development '
The statements came after an all - night meeting on the future of the company .
It follows a power battle between Mr Wiedeking and the head of VW 's supervisory board , Ferdinand Piech .
Wiedeking and Haerter came to the conclusion in the last week that the further strategic development of Porsche ... would be better when they were no longer the responsible people on the board
Porsche statement
Half of that money will go to a " social foundation " .
Meanwhile , Mr Haertner will get a payoff of 12.5 m euros .
Mr Wiedeking will be replaced by Michael Macht , the management board member responsible for production , while personnel chief Thomas Edig will serve as his deputy .
" Wiedeking and Haerter came to the conclusion in the last week that the further strategic development of [ parent firm ]
Porsche SE and Porsche AG would be better when they were no longer the responsible people on the board , " the statement said .
Porsche would not say if the 5bn euros capital increase would come from Qatar .
Mr Wiedeking , 56 , joined Porsche in 1983 .
He left in 1988 , but returned to Porsche in 1991 and became chief executive in 1993 .
In June , Porsche said demand for its cars had been hit by the worldwide recession .
Global sales at the German carmaker declined 28 % to 53,635 vehicles between August 2008 and the end of April , compared with a year earlier .
Mr Wiedeking was credited with turning around the automaker in the 1990s , but it now has some 9bn euros in debt , following his attempts to acquire more shares in Volkswagen .

A special thank you to Bible Money Matters for letting me tell this story of our journey .
Hopefully , it will help others as they seek to do God ’s will with finances .
August 10 , 2009 is a date that we will remember in our family for quite some time .
It ’s a day that some will think is n’t any big deal , but it ’s a huge day in our family .
Taking Stock , And Making A Plan To Be Debt Free
In May 2007 , we sat down and added up all our debt .
It included a bank loan for the adoption of our daughter ( good reason for some debt ! ) , some medical debt from the birth of our son ( another good thing ) , and our car ( yuck ) .
All told , it was just shy of $ 30,000 .
We had been firm believers in Dave Ramsey ’s Baby Steps for quite some time , and we decided to use those steps to snowball our debt away as quickly as possible .
As a preacher ’s family , we knew that the Bible clearly teaches that having debt is n’t a wise decision ( cf. Proverbs 22:7 ) .
We wanted to give more , help others more , and ( yes ) do some fun things in the future .
On August 10 , 2009 , the final debt of that original amount was paid off !
Along the way , we added about $ 4500 in medical debt , of which we still owe about $ 2100 .
We are disputing that amount with insurance , so we are continuing to pay , but we really think we will get to stop soon ( and even get some money back ! ) .
Along the way , we just decided to live on less than we make .
We sold a few smaller items ( totaling about $ 400 ) , but our major way of paying off debt was living below our means .
I drive a car that cost $ 800 .
We turned off our DirecTV package and we go “ TV - less ” , saving us about $ 75 each month )
Our budget for eating out is very tiny ( less than $ 50 each month ) , and we do n’t splurge on presents at all .
Most of all , we are thankful that God has continued to bless us with employment and with a family that has supported us through the process .
While they did n’t always understand our total focus on this , they supported us .
Other young people at church also were behind us ( and we will be going through Financial Peace University with many of them starting in a few weeks ) .
You Can Dump Your Debt Too !
Our journey has not taken as long as some others , but we are thankful to God for what He has done in our lives .
We are happier in our marriage because we have done this as a team .
As a preacher , I often mention money ( since Jesus did ) , and am thankful that I was at least trying to live what I preached in that area .
We are grateful that one reason it took us as long as it did to pay off our debt is that we were able to give no less than 13 % of our income at any time during the journey .
Friend , you can do this !
The feeling is amazing , because it ’s a feeling of freedom .
My wife and I have already listed our next goals , and now we know those goals are attainable .

NEA Attacks Administration 's Education Reform Plan
By Nick Anderson
The nation 's largest teachers union sharply attacked President Obama 's most significant school improvement initiative on Friday evening , saying that it puts too much emphasis on a " narrow agenda " centered on charter schools and echoes the Bush administration 's " top - down approach " to reform .
The National Education Association 's criticism of Obama 's $ 4.35 billion " Race to the Top " initiative came nearly a month after the president unveiled the competitive grant program , meant to spur states to move toward teacher performance pay ; lift caps on independently operated , publicly funded charter schools ; and take other steps to shake up school systems .
The NEA 's statement to the Department of Education came a week before the end of the public - comment period on the administration 's proposal , and it reflected deep divisions over the White House 's education agenda within a constituency largely loyal to the Democratic Party .
The union , which boasts 3.2 million members , charged that Race to the Top contradicted administration pledges to give states more flexibility in how they improve schools .
" We find this top - down approach disturbing ; we have been down that road before with the failures of No Child Left Behind , " the union wrote in its comments , " and we can not support yet another layer of federal mandates that have little or no research base of success and that usurp state and local government 's responsibilities for public education . "
It added : " Despite growing evidence to the contrary , it appears that the administration has decided that charter schools are the only answer to what ails America 's public schools -- urban , suburban , exurban and rural -- and all must comply with that silver bullet . "
An Education Department spokesman had no immediate comment .
Education Secretary Arne Duncan has said repeatedly he wants to work with unions and not foist reforms on teachers without consultation .
When Obama announced the initiative July 24 , Dennis Van Roekel , president of the National Education Association , praised the administration 's intentions to lift standards , raise teacher quality and turn around low - performing schools .
But he said performance pay , charter schools and links between student and teacher data raise difficult issues for his union .
That last issue prompted an NEA objection earlier this year , after Obama expressed his desire to grade teachers through the test scores of their students .
Van Roekel told the New York Times that his members were unhappy with such comments .
'' When he equates teachers with test scores , that 's when we part company , '' Mr. Van Roekel told the Times .

NEW ULM , Minn . —
An arrest warrant was issued today for Colleen Hauser , who failed to bring her 13 - year - old son , Daniel , to a court hearing on whether he should receive chemotherapy against his wishes .
The mother and son have been missing since Monday evening , after they went to a medical appointment that suggested Daniel ’s cancer is getting worse .
Only the father , Anthony , was in court today .
He said he did n’t know their whereabouts , nor had he read the judge ’s order requiring him to get treatment for Daniel or lose custody of the boy .
The attorneys in the case and Brown County District Judge John Rodenberg attempted to locate the missing Hausers during the hearing by calling Colleen ’s cell phone , her mother and Daniel ’s family doctor .
They also questioned Daniel ’s 16 - year - old sister on the stand .
“ The court ’s primary objective at this point , ” Rodenberg said during the hearing , “ is to get to Daniel Hauser . ”
Anthony testified that he had last seen his wife leaving their Sleepy Eye farm on Monday evening .
He said his wife only told him “ she was going to leave ” and “ that ’s all you need to know . ”
Rodenberg ruled last week that Daniel must receive chemotherapy for his cancer , a former of Hodgkin ’s lymphoma , even though it is against the family ’s spiritual beliefs and wishes .
The Hausers belong to the Nemenhah , a quasi-American Indian group that favors natural remedies and opposes any medicine that attacks or harms the body .
The Hausers had been ordered to come to court today with X - ray results showing whether Daniel ’s cancer had gotten worse .
The Hausers were also supposed to select a pediatric oncologist to treat Daniel .
Testifying by phone at the hearing , Dr. James Joyce said he examined Daniel on Monday and found that the 13 - year - old was suffering chest pain and had a new lump under his right collarbone .
Joyce said he recommended that Daniel be transferred immediately for further evaluation by an oncologist and he recommended doctors from Children ’s Hospitals and Clinics of Minnesota , the University of Minnesota and the Mayo Clinic .
Instead , he testified , Daniel and his mother left in a hurry along with a woman who was advising them .
Much of today ’s hearing focused on the apparent influence of this mystery woman , Susan Daya ( also known as Susan Hamwi ) , who apparently is an attorney from California but is n’t formally representing the Hausers in the case .
“ With Susan Daya ’s urging ” at the examination , Joyce testified , “ they indicated they had other places to go and did n’t want any ( oncologist ) referrals right now . ”
A key question for attorneys in the case has been whether Daniel is refusing chemotherapy on his own , or whether his parents have been influencing his judgment .
The next question may be who is influencing the parents .
Attorneys on both sides were stunned by the disappearance .
Daniel ’s court - appointed attorney , Philip Elbert , said he was angry that the parents did n’t bring his client to court .
During the trial over whether Daniel should be forced into chemotherapy , Elbert argued that the judge should listen to the Hausers and allow them to treat Daniel with alternatives , including vitamins , herbs and ionized water .
Now that the judge has ruled , he said it is unfortunate that Colleen Hauser has chosen not to listen to him .
“ The resolution , ” he said , “ is not to flee . ”
Brown County Attorney James Olson called Colleen Hauser ’s actions “ absolutely crazy . ”
The warrant was issued so that police nationwide can apprehend her .
While she could be arrested for failing to appear in court or violating a court order , Olson said the goal of the warrant is to find Daniel rather than to punish the mother .
She “ holds the keys to the jail , ” Olson said .
If Daniel is found , the judge ordered that he be placed in foster care and receive immediate evaluation by a cancer specialist .
During the trial , doctors testified that Daniel had as much as a 90 percent chance of survival with the treatment and a 95 percent chance of death without it .
Daniel received one of seven recommended rounds of chemotherapy after his cancer was diagnosed in January , but did n’t show up for the rest .
Joyce ’s testimony and medical records at today ’s hearing suggested the initial chemotherapy had reduced the size of the tumors in Daniel ’s body .
However , the latest X - ray results showed “ significant worsening . ”
Joyce also said that Daniel has extreme chest pain , probably due to a growing tumor that is pushing a catheter in his body out of place .
Rodenberg ’s order regarding the chemotherapy was conditional on Daniel still being able to benefit from the treatment after the months of delays .
Joyce said the mere X - ray is n’t enough to determine whether the existing plan of chemotherapy and radiation will still work .
He said a cancer specialist needs to evaluate him quickly .
The attorney for the Hauser parents , Calvin Johnson , said the father had been ready to send Daniel to a doctor at the University of Minnesota for further testing .
Anthony Hauser repeatedly stated “ I do n’t know ” when asked about the location of Colleen and Daniel , and about Daya ’s role .
Olson , the county attorney , said he did n’t believe that Anthony Hauser was so forgetful .
The Hausers are a tight - knit family , he said , and unlikely to lose track of one another .
“ Maybe I ’m getting kind of cynical at my old age , ” he said , “ but I find that hard to believe . ”

The end of the Pirate Bay is nearing .
Even if the deal with GGF does n't go through the current owners are likely to sell to one of the other interested parties .
For many BitTorrent fans this means that they have to find an alternative .
Luckily there are plenty of good ones out there .
Replacing The Pirate Bay is easier said then done .
The tracker is currently responsible for approximately half of all public torrent transfers , which represents a significant percentage of global Internet traffic .
However , history has shown that BitTorrent users are an adaptive species that simply migrates to the next site when their home bases become uninhabitable .
While private trackers certainly have their place and will accommodate those lucky enough to get an invite , for this article we are interested in sites that are open to everyone , ranging from full Pirate Bay replacements to a do - it - yourself setup .
If you ’re looking for high speed downloads you could also consider to try Usenet instead ( our Usenet guide ) .
Full Pirate Bay Alternatives
The only full Pirate Bay alternatives are sites that index torrent files , are open to everyone and also have a working tracker .
Unfortunately , there are only a few sites out there that offer this full package - there are four of them below .
We decided to include Demonoid here because it tracks many public torrents .
Torrent Indexers
Torrent indexers are sites that have a searchable directory of torrent files , but do n’t host a ( public ) tracker of their own .
Mininova has a tracker , but they only allow ‘ featured ’ torrents uploaded through their content distribution service .
The most used torrent indexers are :
Torrent Meta -Seach Engines
BitTorrent meta - search engines are yet another brand of torrent sites .
They do n’t have a tracker and do n’t host any torrent files on their servers .
Instead they search for and link to torrents hosted on third party sites .
Private Trackers ( open signup )
Most of the larger private trackers require an invite to join , but there are always a few that allow new members .
Below are four of these ( open ) private trackers and more can be found on Btracs .
Standalone BitTorrent Trackers
Torrent indexers and meta - search engines can be used to find torrents , but none of them will be of much use without a stable BitTorrent tracker .
Standalone BitTorrent trackers are much needed , they handle the communication between downloaders but do n’t index any torrents themselves .
DIY Pirate Bay Alternatives
The last category of Pirate Bay alternatives are the do - it - yourself projects .
By using the three ingredients below The Pirate Bay can be easily rebuilt .
It might take a few hours , but then the path to world domination is clear .
Last but not Least
Google , the mother of all search engines has a filetype : torrent search command that allows you to find torrent files scattered across the Internet .
Also , Google ’s custom search allows everyone to create their own torrent search engine .
Do n’t tell the MPAA and RIAA .
If you think we missed any good alternatives , please feel free to add your own in the comment section below , while clearly noting which category they fit into .
Psystar , the company Apple ’s suing for illegally selling non-Apple hardware running OS X , issued a statement yesterday announcing that it had hired a new law firm , and that they ’re looking forward to answering Apple ’s legal challenges head on .
Included in the statement is an attempt by Psystar to defend its actions .
Everyone here values openness .
And that ’s how we ’re going to fight Apple : in public .
We have nothing to hide .
We buy hundreds of copies of OS X legally , from retailers like Amazon and Apple itself .
We ’re probably one of Apple ’s biggest customers .
Then we install these copies of OS X , along with kernel extensions that we wrote in - house , on computers that we buy and build .
Then we resell the package to people like you .
That ’s it .
Well when you put it that way , it does n’t really seem like Psystar is doing anything wrong at all .
But Psystar ’s telling of the story is overly simplistic , if not purposefully misleading .
Psystar supporters argue that software purchasers have the right to do anything they want with legally purchased programs .
So if someone wants to put OS X on a PC , or sell the install disc on eBay , or even use use the OS X install disc as a coaster for a Steve Ballmer mug , there ’s nothing Apple can legally do to stop them .
And you know what , that ’s 100 % true .
The difference is that Psystar is n’t a 16 year old kid toying around in his basement with OS X and a Dell Mini 9 – it ’s a corporation intent on making a profit by selling modified versions of OS X on PC’s .
Psystar is n’t a “ user ” , it ’s a re-seller , and as such , it ’s roped in by certain laws that simply do n’t apply to a guy off the street who picks up a copy of Leopard at Best Buy .
Psystar ’s actions damage Apple ’s brand , and is essentially false advertising
Imagine going into a bookstore and buying a copy of Harry Potter .
After finishing the book a few hours later , you realize that you were n’t that big a fan of the ending .
So being the creative type , you write up and print out an entirely new ending , take out the last 50 pages from the original and replace them with your newly written prose .
Now imagine setting up a website and selling the new copy by touting the fact that it provides the full Harry Potter experience , but with more action than the original .
Now imagine purchasing 10,000 copies of Harry Potter from surrounding bookstores , changing the ending on all of them , and selling them nationwide in order to make an easy profit .
That ’s essentially what Psystar is doing with OS X , so you ca n’t really argue that they can do whatever they want with purchased software when they ’re modifying it to their own liking , and selling the new product on a massive scale as an Apple OS X experience .
The fact is that it is n’t an Apple OS X experience , a fact evidenced in a number of hands - on reviews of Psystar ’s systems .
The Mac OS is tightly integrated with Apple ’s hardware in order to produce an optimal user experience .
Psystar ’s modified version of OS X might run on a PC , but it just does n’t provide the same polish and user experience as Apple products .
Just because Psystar claims it does does n’t make it true .
A Psystar computer is essentially a modified version of Harry Potter .
It might say Harry Potter on the cover , and the first few chapters may indeed be spot on , but taken as a whole , it ’s a subpar version of the original .
Admittedly , the above synopsis does n’t take into account the full - breadth of legal arguments that will arise when litigation begins in a few months , but it serves to illustrate how misleading and simplistic Psystar ’s statements truly are .
Psystar likes to advertise itself as the little guy taking on a big evil corporation , but the truth is that it ’s a corporation looking to make a quick buck off of the hard work of others .
It ’s as simple as that .

Nothing more needs to be said , at this point , ACTION IS NEEDED ....
A team of researchers from the University of Haifa have stumbled upon a rare desert plant living in Israel ’s mountainous Negev desert , which can irrigate itself .
The plant , the desert rhubarb , Rheum palaestinum , was first classified by a local Israeli botanist about 70 years ago .
It has adapted to harsh desert climates by developing specially designed leaves — broad and with grooves and channels — to funnel even the slightest bit of rainwater directly to its roots .
It is the only known plant of its kind in the world , and could teach science — and people — new ways for maximizing water distribution in agriculture , especially in extremely arid regions .
Locals say it is found only in Israel and nearby Jordan .
ISRAEL21c asked one of the Israeli researchers , Prof. Simcha Lev-Yadun , a botanist , who recently measured the water intake capabilities of the desert rhubarb , if it could lead to new water - collecting devices ( like the ones we ’ve written about here — see the story on Tal - Ya Water ) based on bio-mimicry .
“ You are 2,000 years too late , ” he says .
“ This same type of typography that we see on the plant ’s 1/3 square meter surface was done on the scale of hundreds of meters , if not kilometres , by ancient people who lived in the Negev Desert until the first millennium CE .
I am sure that people found this simple physical rule and exploited it , ” he adds .
No leaves unturned
Aside from being a botanist , Lev-Yadun is also an archeologist , with a first and second degree in the field .
He explains that Nabatean people living in the Negev Desert after the second Temple Period and the late Byzantine period , would pile stones in mounds that the local Arabs call “ mounds for grapes ” .
These stones were set up to funnel water down a hill for irrigation purposes , before the water “ infiltrated the hill , ” says Lev - Yadun , and resembled the surface of the rhubarb .
With his research partners Gadi Katzir and Gidi Ne’eman , also from the University of Haifa , Lev-Yadun ascertained that the reason the rare rhubarb flourishes in hostile areas in the desert , is because it can collect up to 16 times more water than other plants growing in the same region .
They findings were published recently in the journal Naturwissenschaften .
Characterized by large rosette leaves with deep grooves , Lev-Yadun — also an avid hobby photographer — says that the leaves when photographed up close starkly resemble the mountainous regions in which they grow .
Like rainwater through a valley
And the water on the leaves of the rhubarb travel off its surface , in much the same way that rainwater flows through the valleys and slopes of the mountains in the Negev Desert , but on a very different scale .
According to the recent study , the desert rhubarb can harvest 4.2 liters of water each year , with the largest of its kind collecting an astounding 43.8 liters .
Compared to an average rainfall of 75 mm a year , the rhubarb has found a way to make the most of its limited environment .
Additional research into the mechanics of the plant finds that the plant not only funnels the water to its roots , but the water is able to penetrate 10 cm into the soil , 10 times deeper than if the rain landed by itself on the desert sand .
A tough waxy surface on the leaves , lends additional support in funneling the water to the roots where it is needed .
Can scientists take home a message from this plant and create the ultimate irrigation machine ?
Lev -Yadun has no designs on such an invention , but does n’t rule out the possibility .
“ It ’s a rare plant .
We ca n’t plant them by the billions and irrigate with them . ”
But , he adds : “ theoretically one could do the same with plastic and collect the water .
This is already done on a small scale here and there , ” adds Lev-Yadun .

Rise like lions after slumber
in unvanquishable number !
Shake your chains to earth , like dew
Which in sleep had fallen on you —
Ye are many , they are few ! — Percy Bysshe Shelley “ Mask of Anarchy ”
If you do n’t know your history it ’s as if you were born yesterday .
— Howard Zinn
In a recent article , famed trend forecaster , Gerald Celente , wrote :
The natives are restless .
The third shot of the “ Second American Revolution ” has been fired .
History is being made .
But just as with the first two shots , the third shot is not being heard .
America is seething .
Not since the Civil War has anything like this happened .
But the protests are either being intentionally downplayed or ignorantly misinterpreted .
He cites the more than 700 anti-tax rallies and “ Tea Parties ” as evidence of a burgeoning period of passion .
In a nation bearing arms , the power of the first amendment is waning , the power of a chaotic government is encroaching , and the people are growing restless after four decades of declining wages , the prospect of total economic and societal collapse , and a government that must lie in order to perpetuate itself .
In the status quo Machiavellian world of the corporate media , the protests have either been ignored or bastardized , oft in sophomoric light , as references to “ tea bagging ” attest .
The media , by and large , operates at a third grade level .
Upon the election of Barack H. Obama many well - meaning Americans congratulated themselves for the eradication of racism in their country .
However , persons protesting the presidents policies — either by way of demonstrating or what Alex Jones terms “ the Poster Revolution — have been labelled racists .
In August many Senators and House members have hinted at the cancellation of their town hall meetings , as incensed citizens use these forums to voice — rather , shout — their myriad concerns about the direction of the Empire .
A strong presence of police and bodyguards were needed to quell the fervor of the natives .
An increasing number of congressmen speak out against rumors of possible martial law this fall .
Meanwhile , the corporate media slowly integrates such coverage into their programs .
According to Brian Wilson on Fox news , “ Northcom has a proposal sitting on the desk of Secretary of Defense Robert Gates that would authorize the military to backup FEMA should their be an H1N1 pandemic …
One assumes this might be necessary should there be mass quarantines . ” ( according to WHO there already is a level 6 pandemic , organizing all UN nations under effective UN control )
Protestors have been derided as racist , gun-owning militia members of the conservative variety .
In actuality , the irate citizens hail from all facets of the American experience .
Outrage over the issue of healthcare — though few grasp the complex 1000 page health care reform document , legislators included — is “ clearly real and un-staged . ”
The healthcare legislation is piled atop a maelstrom of adventurously genocidal White House policies : “ a series of gigantic , unpopular , government - imposed ( but taxpayer - financed ) bailouts , buyouts , rescue and stimulus packages have been stuffed down the gullet of Americans .
With no public platform to voice their oppositions , options for citizens have been limited to fruitless petitions , e-mails and phone calls to Congress … all fielded by anonymous staff underlings , ” Celente states .
The eugenics approach to science under John Holdren , White House Science Czar , has also stirred many to anger .
Congress is in recess , which means that elected representatives are back in their districts .
The public is partially active .
Celente , who predicted the crash of 1987 and the fall of the Soviet Union , contends , “ Though in its early stages , the ‘ Second American Revolution ’ is underway .
Yet , what we forecast will become the most profound political trend of the century — the trend that will change the world — is still invisible to the same experts , authorities and pundits who did n’t see the financial crisis coming until the bottom fell out of the economy . ”
Trend Forecast : Conditions will continue to deteriorate .
The global economy is terminally ill .
The recession is in a brief remission , not the early stages of recovery .
Cheap money , easy credit and unrestrained borrowing brought on an economic crisis that cannot be cured by monetary and fiscal policies that promote more cheap money , easy credit and unrestrained borrowing .
Nevertheless , Washington will continue to intervene , tax and exert control .
Protests will escalate and riots will follow .
Fourth Shot of the “ Second American Revolution ” :
While there are many wild cards that could light the fuse , The Trends Research Institute forecasts that if the threat of government - forced Swine Flu vaccinations is realized , it will be the fourth shot .
Tens of millions will fight for their right to remain free and unvaccinated .
Celente cites new technologies such as the internet , camera - equipped cell phones , access to YouTube , and twitter , as means rendering the revolutionary spirit nearly impossible to control .
It “ will prove contagious . ”
He does acknowledge that the “ Second American Revolution ” could be “ derailed through some false flag event designed to deceive the public , or a genuine event or crisis capable of rallying the entire nation behind the President …
Given the pattern of governments to parlay egregious failures into mega - failures , the classic trend they follow , when all else fails , is to take their nation to war …
A false flag attempt , a genuine crisis , or a declaration of war , may slow the momentum of the “ Second American Revolution , ” but nothing will stop it . ”
While Celente outlines admirably the multitude of circumstances aligning in the United States , he does miss some key points in his report , such as the U.S. military ’s mobilization on domestic soil .
As Mathew Rothschild from the Progressive details in the article , “ The Pentagon Wants Authority to Post Almost 400,000 Military Personnel in U.S. , ” the Pentagon has requested congress to grant the Secretary of Defense the authority to post almost 400,000 military personnel all over the United States in times of emergency or major disaster .
Mike German , the ACLU ’s national security policy counsel , articulated condemnation “ that the military would propose such a broad set of authorities and potentially undermine a 100 - year - old prohibition against the military in domestic law enforcement with no public debate and seemingly little understanding of the threat to democracy . ”
Further , other various legislation lays groundwork which enables the state , in the event of a national emergency , to vertically align power so as to better concentrate certain citizens from the rest .
For example , the National Emergency Centers Establishment Act allows Homeland Security to use KBR , a subdivision of Haliburton , to establish at least six national facilities for the concenration of civilians , not criminals , on military installations .
In the Field Manual 3- 19 - 40 Military Police Internment / Resettlement Field Operations , a civilian internee is labeled as such : “ CIVILIAN INTERNEE 1 - 7 .
A CI is a person who is interned during armed conflict or occupation if he is considered a security risk or if he needs protection because he committed an offense ( insurgent , criminal ) against the detaining power .
A CI is protected according to the Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War ( GC ) , 12 August 1949 . ”
The REX 84 Program outlines procedures for the continuity of government and the internment and processing of internment of dissidents in the event of civil unrest .
In the United States of America there are federal plans , geared towards events or non-events of unrest or pandemic , for the implementation of martial law and military dictatorship .
The evidence is staggering .
For two - thirds of the citizenry in the U.S. , the Constitution has already been suspended by “ Constitution Free Zones , ” set up two hundred miles from all borders and coasts .
In a recent Huffington Post article , Larry Flynt called for an agreement on a date on which a general strike would be orchestrated .
Music to many of our ears such civil disobedience would be .
He also had this to say :
The American government — which we once called our government — has been taken over by Wall Street , the mega - corporations and the super - rich .
They are the ones who decide our fate .
It is this group of powerful elites , the people President Franklin D. Roosevelt called “ economic royalists , ” who choose our elected officials — indeed , our very form of government .
Both Democrats and Republicans dance to the tune of their corporate masters .
In America , corporations do not control the government .
In America , corporations are the government .
In order to avert senseless bloodshed , starvation , the utilization of an already implemented police state , the United States public must organize and accomplish thousands of large - scale regional switches to partially self - sustainable economies in order to organize a successful and fluid general strike .
This is not the revolution of reform , only the beginning thereof .
Crisis precipitates change through which power is consolidated .
Through the usurpation of power resistance is fomented .
Through resistance and crisis the common forum of ideas is expanded ; people think .
Through thought imagination is realized .
A general strike is but the first action , and the realization of community will mark the onset of the revolutionary reform we all desire : an intellectual and emotional revolution .
LASER Spacecraft
Summary
Change is the only constant in the arena of space and rocket science .
Dr. Lake Mirobo from New Mexico , USA imagines spacecrafts propelled by powerful laser beams .
He has created a prototype of a laser propelled space craft .
A high powered pulse laser beam comes from the backside and reflects off the parabolic shape of the space craft and focuses inside the engine .
The laser beam breaks out the air and blasts out a very strong shock wave and hence propels the spacecraft forward .
The advantage of this technology is that vast amounts of fuel need not be carried into space .
Higher rocket efficiency leads to less fuel being carried in the space craft and also to smaller design of space crafts .
Flash SSDs + RAID = Mind -Blowing Storage Performance
Some months ago , we were informed by A&R Edelman , Samsung ’s PR agency in the US , about a YouTube video showing 24 Samsung PB22 - J flash SSDs configured in a RAID array using a high - end PC .
The guys who produced the video did a great job and reached just beyond 2 GB/s using one Adaptec 5 - series controller card and an Areca 1680 ix board on an Intel dual - CPU " Skulltrail " system .
We felt intrigued by the project and decided to see if we could beat their results .
Why So Much Storage Performance ?
The project makes sense if you look at it from one of two ways .
You can take it as a fun exercise where money is no object , or you can view it with a longer - term outlook to see what future storage products could have in store .
The promotional Samsung video shows what the impact of a super - fast SSD array could be .
The array is capable of loading applications in a fraction of the time required today , and it effectively eliminates all storage - related performance bottlenecks .
But it remains obvious that using 24 ( or even 16 drives , as we did ) , is an impractical scenario on the desktop .
Drive Selection
However , the situation is different on higher - end servers , where a maximum amount of I/O operations per second ( IOPS ) may be imperative for mission - critical applications .
We decided not only to use a large number of flash SSDs , but we also wanted to use the best flash SSDs to trounce Samsung ’s throughput numbers while also providing sensationally high IOPS numbers .
Our choice was Intel ’s X25 - E flash SSD , which is based on more expensive single - level cell ( SLC ) flash memory .
Compared to Samsung ’s multi - level cell ( MLC ) flash , SLC can provide shorter latencies and higher throughput for both reads and writes .
One drawback remains : while Samsung ’s PB22 - J provides a massive 256 GB capacity , Intel ’s X25 - E professional SSDs still max out at 64 GB .
Fortunately , the capacity difference did n’t matter in our race for performance , as only 16 of Intel ’s flash SSDs were enough to beat the 24 drives used in Samsung ’s video .
Let ’s Get It On !
Intel was interested to take on the challenge and provided sixteen 64 GB X25 - E drives for this article .
Meanwhile , we asked Adaptec to provide two 5805 PCI Express RAID cards .
With these , we created a nested array consisting of two RAID 0 hardware RAIDs , which we then used to create a Windows - powered software RAID 0 array across them .
Our approach worked very well , as you ’ll soon see .

LAST year , as Kenya slid into mayhem , the words that sputtered forth from crude transmitters were cryptic but , to those in the know , horrifying .
“ People of the milk ” , a reference to the cattle - owning Kalenjin people , were urged to “ take out the weeds in our midst ” — in other words , the Kikuyus .
Meanwhile Kikuyu broadcasters inveighed against the peril posed by “ animals from the west ” : this meant the rival Luo ( from which Barack Obama originates ) and Kalenjins .
In East Africa this use of radio to incite ethnic slaughter recalled an even darker episode : the Rwandan genocide of 1994 , in which a station called Radio Mille Collines ( Thousand Hills Radio ) seemed to be directing the massacres .
It not only poisoned the general atmosphere but urged on the killers , with phrases like “ cutting the tall trees ” and “ killing the cockroaches ” .
In an era of drones and spy satellites , it may seem odd that crude simple radio transmitters can still make huge mischief .
But the scale and sophistication of broadcasting has mutated downwards as well as upwards .
In the mid-20th century , totalitarian dictators found national radio stations were a handy way to foment hate and fear ; and non-state actors ( from communist guerrillas to churches ) have been using radio for almost as long .
In recent years the medium has been exploited in ever darker ways by petty warlords as well as by big - time tyrants .
Take the war zone on Pakistan 's north - western frontier , where radio's sinister side has been on stark display .
Scores of small FM transmitters —used to propagate extremist ideas and to terrorise local foes — have played a part in shoring up the Taliban 's power .
One notorious user of the air waves is Mullah Fazlullah , a Taliban leader in the Swat valley who is known as the “ Mullah Radio ” because of the threats he issues from an FM transmitter .
After claims that he had been wounded , his voice was heard in mid-July for the first time in several months , albeit more subdued in tone than before .
Peacekeeping pundits agree that more must be done to pre-empt and counter the effects of “ hate radio ” .
Nipping conflict in the bud by silencing dark propaganda would do a lot of good .
If the problem were simply technical , it would presumably be soluble ; an army bristling with space - age gadgetry must be capable of jamming a crude FM transmitter .
But as anybody with experience of the problem confirms , neutralising nasty broadcasts is not so simple .
In Pakistan 's war zones , a policy based purely on jamming , and confiscating kit , would upset local Pushtuns , for whom radio is a vital medium .
Transmitters , often using batteries from cars or motorcycles , are easy to re-establish , says Mukhtar Khan , an analyst with the Jamestown Foundation , a think - tank in Washington , DC .
He thinks the only antidote to hate radio is rival FM transmissions , run by locals who speak familiar dialects and cater to local interests , from farming to music .
A similar point is made by Eric Rosenbach , a veteran of American military intelligence ( with knowledge of the Balkans and Iraq ) who is now research director at Harvard University 's Belfer Centre .
“ You can even further alienate a population if you take away their only source of information — but if you offer something new that 's not obviously artificial , they may grab on to [ it ] . ”
American forces in Afghanistan already seem to be following that advice .
They are making broadcasts of local interest and handing out wind - up radios .
In the world of journalism , meanwhile , some hard thinking is going on about how to stop abuse of the air waves .
Radio Netherlands and Amsterdam University are refining a proposal for an early - warning system that would pick up hate - speech broadcasts , including cryptic ones , and at least mitigate their effects .
But Jan Hoek , who runs the global arm of Radio Netherlands , says he has grown cautious about lavish Western efforts to promote “ good ” media in places like Rwanda where radio was used for evil ends .
It only works , he says , when locals are in the lead ; otherwise the whole effort stops as soon as funds dry up .
Despite these reservations , some fine courageous stations do now serve the region — such as Radio Okapi , broadcasting from Congo ; two of its journalists have been killed .
For analysts of hate radio and its antidotes , the Balkans provide evidence of what works .
The “ ring around Serbia ” , consisting of Serbian - language broadcasts from neighbouring states , which America helped establish , probably helped topple Slobodan Milosevic in 2000 .
And in 1997 , soon after arriving in Bosnia , NATO troops took swift action to seize transmitters and stop broadcasts by hard - line Serbs opposed to the Dayton peace deal .
By contrast , during the bombing of Serbia in 1999 , NATO lost support when it heavy - handedly hit the state broadcasting building in Belgrade , killing 16 staff .
( A Serbian broadcasting boss was later jailed for not passing on NATO 's warnings that the building was a target . )
Richard Holbrooke , the broker of the Dayton accord who is now America 's envoy to Afghanistan and Pakistan , has named broadcasting as one area where lessons learned in one war zone must be transferred to others .
In the Swat valley , he noted in March , “ Fazlullah is going round every night broadcasting the names of people they 're going to behead or have beheaded .
Any of you who have a recent sense of history will know that that 's exactly what happened with Radio Mille Collines in Rwanda . ”
100 Most Essential Words In Anime
100 Most Essential Words in Anime
A couple of years ago when I first started to read manga in Japanese , I really wish I had access to a list like this .
Watching anime over the years had allowed me to pick up at least a partial vocabulary of common expressions .
Having subtitles helped , but by the time I started learning Japanese formally and practicing with manga , I ran across a problem .
Most Japanese classes focus on formal , " proper " language and tend to discourage colloquialisms .
This is for good reason .
The " polite " forms in Japanese are necessary in learning grammar and word order , especially for beginners where more plain forms of the language can be confusing .
Intellectually I knew this , but I still had a problem .
For example , my first attempt at manga had me reading Mitsuru Adachi's " Short Program " .
I kept finding that everyone in the manga was named " omae " .
A little while later , I found out that " omae " is one of several informal ways of aying " you .
" Prior to that , my only word for " you " was " anata . "
See what I mean now ?
So about a year ago I thought about making a list of similar phrases that all anime fans should know , but are n't usually covered in the Basic Japanese Series .
Unfortunately I did n't move fast enough .
Reproduced below is the Yale Anime Society 's Page of 100 Most Essential Words in Anime in all its glory .
I have not changed any of the text , although I have organized the code a bit and cleaned things up .
It 's a pretty good selection ... just about all the choices I would have made .
In the future I will come up with some additions , but for now I am leaving the document itself untouched for your interest .
Everything between the double - rainbow bars is the property of the Yale Anime Society and David Soler .
At the end of the document is contact information for yours truly .
Please feel free to send comments , questions and whatnot .
Thanks for coming by , and enjoy the list .
Remember , this list is for you the fan , made by fans .

THE 100 MOST ESSENTIAL WORDS IN ANIME
by David Soler
Note : Since I want this to be readable in programs with no formatting ability , I 'm employing a modified romanization system .
Instead of putting a diacritical marking above an " o " to indicate a doubled length , I 'll write out " ou . "
I 'm assuming that readers will be familiar with the standard romanization system .
If not , any pocket Japanese - English dictionary will provide a complete explanation of Japanese romanization .
Disclaimers :
This glossary contains my choice of the 100 words which I deem to be most common and / or essential in anime .
Obviously , my opinion is different from that of others .
Students of Japanese should also be cautioned against using this vocabulary without regard to proper context .
To choose an obvious example , do n't attempt curses outside of you close circle of friends .
My friend Akihiko Watanabe has graciously consented to proofread my work .
Of course , any errors which remain are strictly my own .
1. abunai- dangerous .
The term has a broader application in Japanese than a direct translation would suggest , being employed in situations where an English speaker would say " Duck ! " or " Look out ! "
Another common usage is as a euphemism for " deviant , " i.e. a " dangerous " relationship ( abunai kankei ) .
2 . ai- love .
If a native speaker wanted to specify romantic love , he would use the character pronounced koi ( or ren , depending on the context ) .
3 . aite - opponent .
Be careful , the word has many applications that are counter - intuitive .
A more literal reading of the characters would be " the one whom I must face . "
As a result , the word can also refer to one 's dancing partner or the person whom you are addressing in a two - person conversation .
4 . akuma- Satan , Devil .
As with it 's English counterparts , this word can be used figuratively .
5 . arigatou- Thanks .
The full formula is arigatou gozaimasu .
6 . baka- an all - purpose insult denigrating the subject 's intelligence .
Depending on tone of voice and other factors , it can range in severity from " silly " to " retard . "
Other similar insults are aho and manuke , although manuke is more specifically " dolt , buffoon . "
7 . bakemono- monster .
8 . be -da !- the sound made by Japanese when they perform akanbe , a gesture of contempt made by sticking out the tongue and bringing down one lower eyelid .
The gesture is analogous to a Bronx cheer or " Nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah . "
9 . bijin- a beautiful woman .
In terms of frequency and usage , it 's best likened to " babe . "
However , it 's still acceptable in formal speech registers , so is not inherently disrespectful .
10 . chigau - a verb meaning " to deviate , be different . "
In standard Japanese , it 's used to declare that someone is wrong .
When shouted as an explanation , it 's meaning is closer to " No way ! " or " Do n't be ridiculous ! / You are SO off - base ! " 11 . chikara - strength , power .
12 . chikusho- an exclamation of frustration , equivalent to " Damn ! " or " Shit ! "
Comparable exclamations are kuso ( literally " shit " ) and shimatta .
13 . chotto- a little .
Differs from its English counterpart in that it can only be used as an adverb .
( The adjectival form is chiisai . )
When exclaimed , it means " Hold it ! " or " Cut it out ! " 14 . daijoubu- O.K .
Most often encountered in anime when one character inquires as to another 's health .
15 . damaru - be still , silent .
Most often found in its imperative form , Damare ! , meaning " Shut up !/ Silence ! " 16 . damasu- to deceive .
Often encountered in its passive form , damasareru , " to be tricked . " 17 . dame - bad , no good ; no can do .
One very common usage is dame desu / dame da , uttered when refusing permission or indicating that something is a bad idea .
18 . dare - who .
Note that certain particles placed after the word will alter its meaning , i.e. dareka - someone , anyone daremo - no one daredemo - everyone .
19 . doko- where .
20 . fuzakeru - to play games , fool around .
It can also be shaded by tone of voice to assume a harsher meaning , like " bullshitting " or " screw / fuck around . "
21 . gaki- young , immature person .
Often translated as " brat " or " punk . " 22 . gambaru- a literal reading of the characters would be " to adhere to something with tenacity . "
A very popular term used when encouraging someone is a difficult task .
Some English translations are " Hang in there ! , " " Do n't give up ! , " " Do your best ! , " and " Give it your all ! "
Note : the verb phrase shikkari suru has an overlapping meaning , but slightly different connotations .
Apparently , the latter term implies use of innate abilities as opposed to a conscious act of willpower .
The two are generally interchangeable , though .
The command forms of " gambaru " are " gambatte " and " gambare . " 23 . hayai- quick , fast , early .
The adverbial form hayaku means " Hurry up ! " when exclaimed .
24 . hen- strange , weird .
In compound noun phrases , it assumes an older meaning of " change , transformation . "
One such compound that 's especially popular in anime is henshin , meaning " physical transformation " a la Sailor Moon and Voltron .
25 . hentai- although a hen compound , it merits a separate entry .
Its classical meaning is " metamorphosis , transformation . "
It later came to mean " abnormality , " and in modern colloquial Japanese is used almost exclusively to mean " pervert " or " perversion . "
When a woman insults a man in anime , she generally uses on of three terms : hentai , sukebe , and etchi .
Sukebe implies " oversexed " rather than " deviant . "
Etchi can be quite mild in some contexts , comparable to " lewd " or " Fresh ! "
These three terms are often used interchangeably , especially when someone is stringing together insults .
Though not as frequent , the word ( o -) kama refers specifically to transvestitism and other gender - bending actions associated with homosexuality .
26 . hidoi- severe , harsh .
As an exclamation , it means " How terrible ! " or " That 's harsh / cold ! "
A spoken variant is " Hide-e ! " 27 .
hime - princess .
28 . ii- good .
An older variant , still current , is yoi .
Yoku is the abverbial form .
Yokatta is the familiar past tense .
When used as an exclamation , it can mean " That 's great ! , " but is usually better translated as " I 'm so glad ! " 29 .
iku- to go .
Common conjugated forms are ikimashou , ikou , ( Shall we go ? / Let 's go ) , ike and ikinasai ( Go!/ Begone ! ) .
30 . inochi- life .
There are a couple of words in Japanese which can be translated as " life , " but inochi is the proper term in the more dramatic situations common in anime , such as " to stake one 's life , " " to take a life " and " more important than life . "
31 . itai- hurt , pain ; painful .
A common explanation , it 's equivalent to " Ouch ! " A frequent spoken variant is Ite - e! 32 . jigoku- Hell .
Hades .
33 . joshikousei- a female high school student .
That 's the literal meaning , anyway .
In Japan , it invariably refers specifically to a cute high school girl in a sailor uniform .
That Japanese has such a compact , productive phrase for this image implies that it's an important archetype in the Japanese psyche .
34 . kamawanai- regardless of .
When uttered as an exclamation , it means " I do n't care ! "
Kamawan is a more brusque spoken variant .
35 . kami- God , god .
This term can also be applied to any supernatural being with a specific domain / charge / sphere .
36 . kanarazu - an adverbial prefix indicating something will happen surely and / or inevitably .
As an exclamation , it means " I swear it ! " or " No matter the cost ! " 37 . kareshi- boyfriend .
Kanojo is the equivalent word for " girlfriend . "
Koibito can be applied to both sexes , but it implies a more serious relationship .
38 . kawaii- cute .
More than a mere adjective , kawaii qualifies as an aesthetic and an obsession in Japan .
A less common , secondary meaning is " cherished , beloved . "
Note : kawai sou means " How sad " or " How pitiful . " 39 . kedo - but , but still .
More formal variants are keredo and keredomo .
The latter form is generally restricted to writing Japanese nowadays .
40 . kega - wound , injury .
It 's also possible to use this term to refer to a spiritual violation or defilement .
41 . keisatsu- Police .
42 . ki- this term is used in countless compounds and idioms .
Although there are too many to describe in detail , " ki " is generally used in two senses .
One is its literal meaning of " air . "
The other is its figurative meaning of " spiritual essence . "
Many English speakers know this concept through the Chinese loan word " chi . "
One common compound is kimochi , the chi one bears , hence " mood . " 43 . kokoro- heart .
Common extensions of this meaning are " sincerity " and " spirit / willpower . " 44 . korosu- to kill .
Often occurring in the passive past tense ( korosareta ) and imperative tense ( Korose ) .
45 . kowai- to be frightful , afraid .
The exclamation Kowaii !
Can be translated as either " Scary thought ! " or " I 'm scared ! , " depending on the context .
46 . kuru- to come .
It 's command form , Koi ! , can mean either " Come here ! " or " Come on ! " 47 . mahou- magic , magic spell .
48 . makaseru - to place one 's trust in someone or something , to count on .
49 . makeru- to lose .
The phrase Makeru mon ka !
Means " I can 't / wo n't give up ! " or " I 'll never give up ! " 50 . mamoru- to protect , guard .
The inflected form most commonly found in anime is mamotte ageru , " I 'll protect you . "
51 . masaka-
Can it be ? ;
It ca n't be ! , No! 52 . matsu- to wait .
The shouted command " Wait " is " Matte ( kudasai ) ! " or " Machinasai ! "
Mate ! is an abbreviated form of Matte! 53 . mochiron - of course , without a doubt .
54 . mou- already .
As an exclamation of frustration , it means " Enough ! " or " Geez ! " 55 .
musume - young woman .
As an epithet , ko musume is stronger than a literal translation of " little girl " would suggest .
When used in this sense , " girlie " or " bitch " come closer to capturing the meaning .
56 . naka- a word referring to one 's relations , both familial and platonic .
Nakayoku suru means " to get along . "
" Nakama " means " close friend (s ) " or " trusted ally ( - ies ) . "
57 . nani- what .
58 . naruhodo - I see . ; So. 59 . nigeru- to flee .
Often used in the imperative form , Nigete ! or Nigero ! , in which case it 's best translated as " Run ! " or " Get away ! " 60 . ningen - human ; humanity .
Refers to mankind as a species , especially when contrasted with alien races , demons , elves , etc. 61 . ohayou- abbreviated form of ohayou gozaimasu , " good morning . "
Men have the option of using the reduced form ossu in casual speech .
62 . okoru- to get angry .
63 . onegai- truncated form of onegai shimasu , " I beg of you , " " Please " or " Pretty please . "
Without the o- prefix , it means " wish . " 64 . oni- demon , ogre , or any other supernatural life form inimical to mankind .
65 . Ryoukai !- message received and understood - " Roger ! " 66 .
Saa - a noncommittal reply indicating that one has understood a statement and given it serious thought .
Some possible translations are " So ! , " " Well ! , " and " Beats me ! " ( A good English equivalent might be the British " Innit ? " ) 67 . sasuga - a person is living up to his reputation or the speaker 's personal expectations .
Yahari , on the other hand , refers to situations proceeding as expected or dreaded .
( Yahari is often translated as " I knew it ! " when used in exclamatory mode . )
Yappari is a more casual variant of yahari .
Other like terms are aikawarazu , " the same as always , " and Sono touri , which means just so when employed as a response to a question .
68 . sempai- anyone who is one 's senior in a hierarchical organization .
The term cuts across all classes and occupations , and must be translated according to context .
69 . shikashi- however , but , nevertheless .
70 . shikata ga nai- an expression meaning " No help for it , " " No way to avoid it , " " Nothing left but to deal with it . "
Shou ga nai is an abbreviated form .
71 . shinjiru- to believe in .
The inflected form most frequently encountered in anime is shinjirarenai , " I can't believe it ! " 72 . shinu - to die .
The most common inflected forms are Shinda , " Dead . " , Shinanaide ! , " Do n't die ! " , and Shi'ne ! , " Die ! " 73 .
shitsukoi- persistent , relentless , tenacious - at the very least a constant pain in the ass .
74 . sugoi- one of three common superlatives that all happen to begin with su- .
The other two are suteki and subarashii .
The three are generally interchangeable .
However , sugoi often expresses an admiration for someone else 's power or talent , and may be mixed with a sense of dread .
It can straddle the line between " awesome " and " awful . "
Suteki is most often applied to physical appearance .
It 's used most often by women , but it can be applied to both genders .
Subarashii is more neutral and can be translated as " great . "
Although lacking the su- beginning , kakkoi is a superlative used mostly in describing people - " Cool ! "
Note : A spoken variant of sugoi is Suge - e! 75 . suki - affection , liking .
Also used to signify " love . "
If anything , the phrase " Suki da . " is even more ambiguous than the English " I like you . " 76 . suru- to do .
A frequently occurring phrase is " Dou shiyou ? , " meaning " ( Oh , ) What shall I do ! " 77 . taihen - when modifying an adjective , it means " extremely . "
When it describes a situation without any other adjectives , it means " terrible . " 78 . tasukeru- to aid .
The exclamation " Tasukete kure ! " =
" Help me !/ Save me ! " 79 . tatakau - to fight , do battle .
80 . teki- enemy .
81 . tomodachi- friend .
82 . totemo- very , extremely .
It can be pronounced tottemo to indicate extra enthusiasm .
83 . unmei- fate , destiny .
84 . uragirimono- traitor .
85 . ureshii- happy .
As an exclamation , Ureshii !
Can be translated as " I 'm so happy ! " or even " Whee ! " 86 . urusai- noisy .
When used as an exclamation , it 's best translated as " Be quiet ! " and occasionally " Shut up ! " Usse-e ! is a spoken variant .
87 . uso- a lie .
As an exclamation , it can mean " You must be kidding ! , " " You lie ! , " or " No way ! "
Spoken variants are Usso! and Ussou .
The word usotsuki means " liar . " 88 . uwasa- rumor .
89 . wakaru- to understand .
Common inflections are wakatta ( understood ) and wakaranai ( do n't understand ) .
Note that the abbreviated forms of wakaranai are gender specific , with women favoring wakannai and men likely to say wakaran or wakanne - e. 90 .
wana- trap , snare .
91 . yabai- miserable , wretched ( situation ) .
As an exclamation , this can be translated as " This is bad ! " or an emphatic " Uh- oh . " 92 . yakusoku- promise , oath .
93 . yameru- to stop , quit , terminate .
The exclamation Yamero ! can be translated as " Stop ( it ) ! " or " Enough ! " 94 . yaru - this verb has several meanings .
It 's a deferential form of the verb " to do . "
It 's also a form of the verb " to give " reserved for gifts made to social inferiors ( and plants and animals ) .
Finally , it can mean " to try , attempt . " 95 . yasashii- although pronounced the same as the Japanese word for " easy , " in anime it 's more likely to refer to the character for " splendid , exceptional . "
For example , yasashii seikaku means " good - natured " and yasashii hito means " a great guy . " 96 . yatta- probably originated as the past tense of yaru , but has long since taken on an independent meaning .
Used to proclaim victory or good fortune .
Possible translations include " Hooray ! , " " Banzai ! , " " I did it ! , " and " Yay ! " 97 . yoshi- an exclamation used when readying oneself to take an important action .
Possible translations include " Here I come ! , " " All right ( , then ) ! "
Spoken variants are yosshi and yo- oshi !
98 . youkai- an occult monster .
Sometimes used as a general term for occult phenomena .
99 . yume - dream .
100 . yurusu- to forgive , pardon .
Forms of this verb commonly found in anime are O - yurushi kudasai or Yurushite kudasai , meaning " Forgive me ! "
Even more common is yurusanai / yurusenai .
This phrase can be literally translated as " I wo n't / ca n't forgive you ! , " but an idiomatic translation generally requires that attention be paid to the specific circumstances in which the exclamation is shouted or growled .
" I will grant no quarter ! " might work in some historical periods , but " You 're finished ! " would work better in most contemporary settings .
Other possibilities which work in certain circumstances are " Your day is done ! , " " It 's curtains for you ! , " " You 're through ! " ... you get the idea .
A Word on Pronouns :
I was going to avoid discussing larger questions of syntax and usage altogether .
Unfortunately , the pronouns a character reveal so much about personality and background that I feel obligated to try and explain them .
This aspect of Japanese is easily lost in translation , since in English they can only be translated as " I " or " you . "
I 'm including some personal conjectures in my explanations , so please forgive any errors that may occur .
When using the first person , the Japanese speaker can choose among the following words : watashi , watakushi , atashi , boku , ore , sessha , washi , and atai .
This list is by no means complete , also .
All of these terms are translated " I " even though each word has different connotations .
Watashi is polite without indicating deference or formality .
Boku is used by young men ( and young women actively emulating male behavior ) .
Ore is even more overtly masculine , and implies either that a man is speaking among intimates ( at the least that there are no women present ) or that he is aggressively macho .
Atashi is strictly feminine speech .
Watakushi is an older form of watashi .
Today it 's considered slightly more formal , and its use indicates that the speaker is paying conscious attention to decorum .
Watakushi is favored by women , but might also be used by men , especially in the service industry .
Sessha is an older form , and implies courtliness and modesty .
Washi is used by older men in positions of authority .
Atai is associated with the lower class .
Japanese second - person pronouns include omae , onore , kisama , anata , anta , kimi , onushi , and temee .
In practice , second - person pronouns are usually avoided - something possible because the Japanese language does n't demand that the subject be included in a sentence .
There are signs that Japanese teenagers and young adults are starting to use omae as an all - purpose pronoun analogous to the English " you . "
This practice is not entrenched in the language yet , and older usages still survive , so use omae with caution .
Omae is traditionally used in conversation with someone dear to the speaker , and to many Japanese it is this romantic connotation that is the truest sense of the word .
Finally omae is used as a familiar form of address , signaling that the speaker is brash , casual , and does n't respect convention .
This assumption of familiarity can be taken as insulting .
Since omae has so many different ( and sometimes clashing ) connotations , use it with caution .
Kisama is a masculine form of address which can be openly insulting .
It seems that in anime the brash , defiant hero can use omae while his villainous counterpart will use kisama to indicate his distaste for the person he is addressing .
Onore was once formal usage , but is now considered rude and offensive .
Anata is generally used when speaking with social inferiors , and can be made insulting by tone of voice , BUT it also functions as an endearment when a woman uses it to speak with her husband .
Anta is a variant of anata used by women , and is not necessarily rude .
Kimi is male speech , used when speaking to people you have direct authority over , i.e. a vice - president speaking to the secretary , or a teacher addressing a student .
Kimi is also how a boy refers to his girlfriend .
Onushi is archaic polite usage , and sounds quaint when used in modern speech .
Third person is easier because Japanese speech favors using title and / or surname .
Aitsu and yatsu are the two third - person pronouns that come to mind .
Both are extremely casual , and generally slightly insulting .
( It appears that yatsu may be preferred when referring to people outside of one 's social class .
An absolutely neutral way of referring to some one else is ano hito , " that person . "
Complicating things further is that Japanese speakers actually have a good deal of flexibility in choosing which pronouns they use .
The extreme situations found in anime also lead to unorthodox usage .
When Ranma changes into a woman , do his speech patterns change ?
Let 's take Pai from 3x3 Eyes as a specific example .
In her normal personality , she refers to herself as " Pai " instead of using a first person pronoun .
She may be mirroring the practice of her race 's native language .
However , using first - name instead of a first - person pronoun is common practice in Japan among children and child - like people .
That 's why Pai's speech seems natural and appropriate to a Japanese speaker .
Conversely , in her " Sanjiyan " mode , Pai refers to herself as washi .
That 's because the Sanjiyan personality is inhumanly old and powerful .
Some less fantastic examples of unorthodox speech include a male homosexual using feminine speech , and a female juvenile delinquent using masculine pronouns .
Pronouns are an especially complex and frustrating part of the Japanese language , but they can impart a lot of information in a rapid and subtle fashion .
This versatility in responding to different situations is one of the Japanese language 's defining characteristic , adding much to the richness and character of its speech .

Plane beautiful : The day the Red Arrows were upstaged by Mother Nature
Advertisement
Their twisting aerial manoeuvres with coloured smoke trailing in the wake is not normally upstaged .
But the Red Arrows 's display was not the only thing to light up the sky yesterday .
A rainbow cast itself across the coast of Fowey in Cornwall just as the RAF acrobatic team were about to perform its stunts .
Plane brilliant :
The usually spectacular Red Arrows display was given a helping hand by Mother Nature
The burst of colour brought to life the spectacle that is normally reserved only for the tiny red aircraft .
The team of five planes were performing at the town 's annual Royal Regatta in front of thousands of people .
It is the 32nd year - in - a- row that the Red Arrows have taken to the skies above the town at speeds of more than 400mph .
Crowd pleaser :
The display brightened up the grey skies above the Fowey estuary
But the colourful display could have not happened if RAF chiefs had got their way .
Three years ago , senior officers who were ordered to cut millions from their budgets proposed saving £ 500,000 a year by restricting ' The Reds ' to cheaper white smoke .
But ministers realised the plans would be a public relations disaster and ordered a rethink in 2006 .
Double the fun :
As the Red Arrows race through the rainbow , a second can be seen
Coloured trails have been a Red Arrows trademark since they formed in 1965 .
People all over the world watch their breathtaking stunts as the nine jets criss - cross the sky 6ft apart at 400 mph , trailing Union Jack colours .
To create the smoke , diesel is sprayed into the Hawk jets ' exhaust plumes , where it vaporises into white gas .
This is vital for safety as it helps pilots pick out other planes quickly .
But the red and blue smoke uses costly specialist dyes , extra tanks and hydraulic nozzles .

Despite President Obama ’s prediction that it will create new jobs , the global warming bill passed by the House of Representatives will mean fewer jobs by 2030 than if Congress did not act at all , according to the first comprehensive study of the measure by the federal government .
The Energy Information Administration report , requested by the two Democrats who wrote the House bill , says the short - term economic consequences are small , but “ after 2025 , the rapid increase in energy prices causes the economy to contract ” as more rigid requirements kick in .
The House passed its bill June 26 on a 219 - 212 vote , and a week later Mr. Obama said the legislation “ holds the promise of millions of new jobs — jobs , by the way , that ca n’t be outsourced . ”
The Senate still is drafting its version of the climate bill .
But the EIA report , in a chart examining employment , reports that if the bill were implemented , employment actually would be a quarter of a percent lower in 2030 than would otherwise be the case , with the manufacturing sector suffering a 2.5 percent drop in jobs .
The House bill imposes a limit on overall U.S. greenhouse gas emissions and tightens that cap as time goes on , requiring polluters to either reduce their emissions or offset their pollution by paying others to reduce their emissions .
The system is known as “ cap - and - trade . ”
The study by the EIA , an Energy Department agency that is the government ’s official analyst for energy issues , does not say how effective the bill would be in reducing global temperatures or in lessening U.S. reliance on foreign sources of energy — two other primary goals its Democratic sponsors have laid out .
The Democratic authors of the global warming bill — Rep. Henry A. Waxman of California , chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee , and Rep. Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts , a subcommittee chairman — requested the EIA study to look at the consequences of their bill .
EIA says the bill will hurt the economy .
The climate measure “ increases the cost of using energy , which reduces real economic output , reduces purchasing power and lowers aggregate demand for goods and services .
The result is that projected real gross domestic product ( GDP ) generally falls relative to the reference case , ” according to the EIA study .
Mr. Waxman and Mr. Markey insisted that the report shows their bill is an affordable way to cut greenhouse gases .
One section of the EIA analysis forecast there would be only minimal impact on energy prices by the carbon cap plan , at least in the first decade after cap - and - trade is implemented .
“ The evidence is now overwhelming that this clean - energy legislation is both affordable and effective .
American clean energy will grow substantially , and so will clean - energy jobs that ca n’t be shipped overseas , ” they said .
EIA analysts said there is a lot of uncertainty about how the program will play out , and looked at six different possible scenarios for how quickly technological advances will bring reductions in greenhouse gas levels and how easily U.S. companies will be able to pay those overseas to offset U.S. emissions .
According to the worst - case scenario — if technology does n’t materialize and other countries refuse to cooperate on offsets — consumer prices could be 14 percent higher in 2030 than they would otherwise be without the global warming bill .

As you shove your way through the crowd in a baseball stadium , the lenses of your digital glasses display the names , hometowns and favorite hobbies of the strangers surrounding you .
Then you claim a seat and fix your attention on the batter , and his player statistics pop up in a transparent box in the corner of your field of vision .
It 's not possible today , but the emergence of more powerful , media - centric cellphones is accelerating humanity toward this vision of " augmented reality , " where data from the network overlays your view of the real world .
Already , developers are creating augmented reality applications and games for a variety of smartphones , so your phone 's screen shows the real world overlaid with additional information such as the location of subway entrances , the price of houses , or Twitter messages that have been posted nearby .
And publishers , moviemakers and toymakers have embraced a version of the technology to enhance their products and advertising campaigns .
" Augmented reality is the ultimate interface to a computer because our lives are becoming more mobile , " said Tobias Höllerer , an associate professor of computer science at UC Santa Barbara , who is leading the university 's augmented reality program .
" We 're getting more and more away from a desktop , but the information the computer possesses is applicable in the physical world . "
Tom Caudell , a researcher at aircraft manufacturer Boeing , coined the term " augmented reality " in 1990 .
He applied the term to a head - mounted digital display that guided workers through assembling electrical wires in aircrafts .
The early definition of augmented reality , then , was an intersection between virtual and physical reality , where digital visuals are blended in to the real world to enhance our perceptions .
Augmented Reality Today Total Immersion is one of the most successful augmented reality providers today , having created interactive baseball cards , a 3 - D tour of the Star Trek Enterprise , and now , a new line of Mattel actions figures based on the upcoming sci- fi- flick , Avatar .
Here 's a quick look at how their augmented reality technology works .
Take the baseball cards .
Users have to first log on to a URL ( www.toppstown.com) and enter a 3 - D section where they enter an interactive code found on their baseball card to activate the software .
Then , they can hold the card under a webcam and Total Immersion 's software goes to work .
continue reading ...
Futurists and computer scientists continue to raise their standards for a perfectly augmented world .
Höllerer 's dream for augmented reality is for it to reach a state in which it does not rely on a pre-downloaded model to generate information .
That is , he wants to be able to point a phone at a city it 's completely unfamiliar with , download the surroundings and output information on the fly .
He and his peers at UCSB call this idea " Anywhere Augmentation . "
But we have a long way to go — perhaps several years — before achieving Anywhere Augmentation , Höllerer said .
Augmented reality is stifled by limitations in software and hardware , he explained .
Cellphones require superb battery life , computational power , cameras and tracking sensors .
For software , augmented reality requires a much more sophisticated artificial intelligence and 3 - D modeling applications .
And above all , this technology must become affordable to consumers .
The best possible technology that is available today would nearly cost $ 100,000 for a solid augmented - reality device , Höllerer said .
Given the cost of creating decent augmented - reality technology , early attempts have focused on two areas .
One , augmented reality for your computer is prominently appearing in attention - grabbing , big - budget advertisements .
And a few consumer applications of the technology are just beginning to surface in smartphones .

A recent example of augmented reality appeared in the marketing campaign for the sci- fi blockbuster District 9 .
On the movie 's official website was a " training simulator " game , which asked computer users to print a postcard containing the District 9 logo and hold it in front of a webcam .
The postcard contains a marker ; when the game detects that marker in the webcam video , it overlays a 3 - D hologram of a District 9 character on the computer screen .
From there , players can click buttons to fire a gun , jump up and down or throw a human against a wall in the game .
( See video above . )
Mattel is using the same type of 3 - D imaging augmented reality in " i- Tag " action figures for James Cameron 's new movie Avatar .
The toy includes a card containing a marker , which is projected as a 3 - D action figure on a computer .
This way , children can battle each other 's virtual characters on a computer screen .
But augmented reality is n't truly useful in a static desktop environment , Höllerer said , because people 's day - to - day realities involve more than sitting around all day ( outside of work , at least ) .
And that 's why smartphones , which include GPS hardware and cameras , are crucial to driving the evolution of augmented reality .
Brian Selzer , co-founder of Ogmento , a company that creates augmented reality products for games and marketing , recognizes the need for augmented reality to go mobile .
He said his company is working on several projects coming in the near future to help market mainstream movies with augmented reality smartphone apps .
For example , movie posters will trigger interactive experiences on an iPhone , such as a trailer or even a virtual treasure hunt to promote the film .
" The smartphone is bringing AR into the masses right now , " Selzer said .
" In 2010 every blockbuster movie is going to have a mobile AR campaign tied to it . "

On the consumer end of the spectrum , developers have recently released augmented reality apps for the Google Android - powered HTC G1 handset .
Layar , a company based in Amsterdam , released an augmented reality browser for Android smartphones in June .
The Layar browser ( video above ) looks at an environment through the phone 's camera , and the app displays houses for sale , popular restaurants and shops , and tourist attractions .
The software relies on downloading " layers " of data provided by developers coding for the platform .
Thus , while the information appears to display in real time , it 's not truly real - time :
The app can't analyze data it has n't downloaded ahead of time .
" This is the first time media , internet and digital information is being combined with reality , " said Martin Lens - FitzGerald , co-founder of Layar .
" You know more , you find more , or you see something you have n't seen before .
Some people are even saying that it might be even bigger than the web . "
Cellphone giant Nokia is currently testing an AR app called Point & Find , which involves pointing your camera phone at real - world objects and planting virtual information tags on them ( above ) .
Users of the app can view each other 's tags on the phone screen , essentially crowdsourcing an augmented reality .
" This year we 're feeling a real urgency to work on augmented reality because the hardware is finally catching up to our needs , " said Rebecca Allen , director of Nokia 's research center in Hollywood .
Georgia Tech 's Augmented Environments Lab has been researching augmented reality for a decade and recently shifted its focus onto handhelds .
The video demo above , which the lab created in collaboration with the Savannah College of Art and Design , demonstrates an augmented - reality zombie shooter called ARhrrrr .
The smartphone in use is a prototype containing an Nvidia Tegra , a powerful chip specializing in high - end graphics for mobile devices .
How do you play ?
Point the phone camera at a map containing markers , and a 3D hologram of a town overrun by zombies appears on the phone 's screen .
Using the phone , you can shoot the zombies from the perspective of a helicopter pilot .
And you can even place ( real ) Skittles on the physical map and shoot them to set off ( virtual ) bombs .
As for the iPhone , officially there are no augmented reality apps in the App Store yet — because Apple does n't provide an open API to access live video from the phone 's camera .
This barrier prompted augmented reality enthusiasts and professionals to write an Open Letter to Apple pleading for access to this API to make augmented reality apps possible in the App Store .
Brad Foxhoven , Selzer 's partner at Ogmento , said Apple has told him the next version of the iPhone OS ( 3.1 ) " would make [ AR developers ] happy , " implying the live - video API will become open , and AR apps will become available very soon .
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Vbh7nHalCc
Meanwhile , some augmented reality developers have already hacked away at the iPhone 's software development kit to code proof - of - concept augmented reality apps .
The video above demonstrates an app called Twittaround , an augmented reality Twitter viewer on the iPhone .
The app shows live tweets of mobile Twitter users around your location .
" We 're doing as much as we can with the current technology , " Selzer said regarding the overall augmented - reality developer community .
" This industry is just getting started , and as processing speeds speed up , and as more creative individuals get involved , our belief is this is going to become a platform that becomes massively adopted and immersed in the next few years . "

MRE stands for Meal Ready to Eat , and was introduced in 1981 .
An MRE is a complete meal and are used primarily for military personnel .
Each MRE contains an entree , side dish , carbohydrate , dessert or candy , seasoning or sauce , utensils for eating , and a beverage .
MRE 's can be purchased by the general public , but are often somewhat expensive .
Gather the foods you wish to use in your MRE .
Choose any foods you like , but do not use any foods which will require refrigeration or dairy products for their preparation .
A typical MRE will contain items from all the basic food groups .
If anything will require seasoning or eating utensils , include those as well .
Arrange your food choices into meals .
Try to make balanced meals for nutritional reasons .
Most store - bought or military - provided MRE 's contain roughly 1200 calories .
Base your meals on your own nutritional needs .
Dehydrate the arranged food items for your MRE .
If a food has water in it , it needs to be dehydrated for preservation .
When it comes to fruits and vegetables , you can choose canned goods or fresh goods .
Follow the instructions included with the food dehydrator to successfully dehydrate all items .
Puncture any pre-packaged items ( crackers , ramen noodles , etc ) .
This will prevent the packages from causing your final product to be bulky .

This is for every man and woman out there who is n't a bartender , but likes to play one when at home entertaining guests .
I have bartended for a few years ( too many , but I do n't feel like aging myself ) .
I built my own bar at home , in my kitchen .
It has hanging glass racks and room for all of my supplies .
First you need to set up your bar .
This is going to be set up how you like it and visually what you want , but above your bar there should be hanging glass racks where the glasses slide in by the bottom .
Go to any bar and look at how they have theirs hung and that will give you an idea of how to build yours .
Mine are made of wood and I built them in a wall recess , shelf area .
Each rack is made of one L shaped rack and one reverse L rack to make one rack .
Glassware : 6 of each
Margarita glasses
Martini glasses
Wine glasses
Shot glasses
Rocks glasses
Tumblers
Chimneys
Wet bar supplies
S&S ( Sweet and Sour )
Triple Sec
Rose 's Lime and grenadine
Tomato Juice
OJ
Cranberry juice
Bottle of Coke
Bottle of 7 up
1/2 and 1/2
grapefruit juice
Well Liquors ( generic or choice )
Vodka
Gin
Tequila
Rum
Whiskey
Scotch
Khalua
Garnishes
Sliced Limes
Sliced Lemons
Olives
Cherries
Other miscellaneous Supplies
Crushed ice
Bar towel
Shaker with strainer
Margarita salt spinner
Toothpicks
Worcestershire
S&P
Tabasco
Celery Salt
Bartender 's Bible ( recipe book )
various sized straws
blender
You are basically ready to open up your home bar .
Here 's a couple of recipes to get you started :
Screwdriver
1 1/2 oz Vodka
Fill with OJ
Greyhound
1 1/2 oz vodka
fill grapefruit juice
( for salty dog simply salt rim )
Tequila sunrise
1 1/2 oz tequila
roses lime
triple sec
fill with OJ
splash roses grenadine and cherry for garnish
Now you are ready with a few basics , only buy juices and fresh fruit for as much as you need that night ( obviously they will spoil ) .
You can get as fancy as you want , that 's what being a mixologist is all about .
You can show off a little with your garnishes by making lime and lemon twists .
Making fancy garnishes is n't all that hard , just use your imagination .
Think about color and presentation .
If you have a friend who bartends have them give you a couple of lessons before striking out on your own .
Any questions feel free to e-mail me .
Did a charity fundraiser get throttled ?
Filmmaker Brad
Fox told the CRTC Wednesday that he believes an online fundraiser for the Toronto Sick Kids ' Hospital may have been throttled by Bell because it resembled peer - to - peer traffic .
The 30 - hour online " telethon " put on by Fox and a group of Canadian comedians in November 2008 was streamed online using Bell internet services , but was forced to reset four or five times because its connection speed was so slow around 3 a.m. and 4 a.m. , Fox said .
Each time , he told CBC News , he lost up to 10 per cent of his audience .
Fox suggested that perhaps the telethon was mistaken for a peer - to - peer file transfer , and was therefore throttled .
After all , he said , like a P2P transfer , it involved small packets sent at a regular rate over a long period of time .
He added that Bell did not explain the situation , but said it would have been able to ensure better service had it known about the event in advance .
A Bell spokeswoman confirmed Wednesday that only " P2P traffic that uses up a large amount of bandwidth is slowed down … and only during peak hours . "
The company has long said the practice is needed to reduce internet congestion by putting the brakes on a few " bandwidth hogs , " improving service for everyone .
The company did not respond directly when asked how it ensures that other types of traffic are n't throttled by accident , but did specify that it " does not look at content . "
Interestingly ,
Fox was n't the only person to complain of inexplicably slow internet speeds , including non -P2P traffic while using Bell 's service .
Advocates for people with disabilities also told the CRTC Wednesday that some of their peer - to - peer traffic was being throttled even during low - traffic times - like during early morning hours .
Meanwhile , internet service for some of their non-P2P applications for people with disabilities was also inexplicably slow , they said .
( I should note that they also reported throttling during non-peak hours by Rogers ) .
After hearing several similar stories on the same day , some people may suspect that Bell has a funny definition of " peak hours . "
But even if its definition is the conventional one , it appears two conclusions can be drawn :
Bell offers no guarantees that it throttles only P2P traffic .
Bell 's internet service does n't consistently approach its advertised speeds even during non-peak hours .
I should mention that a number of people have made the latter complaint about ISPs in general throughout theCRTC hearings this week .
The hearings are looking into how ISPs manage internet traffic and congestion , and whether practices such as throttling should be allowed .
At first the question of real speed versus advertised speed does n't seem within the scope of the hearings , but IT consultant Jean François Mezei suggested Tuesday that forcing ISPs to disclose their true speeds could do a lot to improve congestion and internet traffic management practices .
" If they were forced to advertise that , " he said , " you might find throttled speed would go up and the congestion problem would disappear . "

The talk has been pulled from the BlackHat conference :
Barnaby Jack , a researcher with Juniper Networks , was to present a demonstration showing how he could jackpot a popular ATM brand by exploiting a vulnerability in its software .
Jack was scheduled to present his talk at the upcoming Black Hat security conference being held in Las Vegas at the end of July .
But on Monday evening , his employer released a statement saying it was canceling the talk due to the vendor ’s intervention .
McCulloh and Carley used metanetwork analysis to analyze 1500 videos made by insurgents in Iraq .
" The insurgents would videotape most of their attacks as propaganda , " says McCulloh .
" As of March 2006 , we had something like almost three out of every four U.S. deaths [ on tape ] . "
Carley extracted data from these videos , he says , " made a big network out of it , and ran a fragmentation algorithm which clustered them into little groups .
And when you go back and look at the videos in those groups , you see forensic clues that identify who some of the insurgent cells were . "
The details extracted from the videos are classified , " because we worry that the insurgents will learn what we 're using , " McCulloh says .
He and Carley worked with the U.S. military to " operationalize " the technique in Iraq .
U.S. commanders there are faced with too much information and too little time to act on it .
McCulloh says that Carley 's metanetwork software helps them find clues and patterns — boosting the chances of catching or killing insurgents .
McCulloh claims that the technique has yielded dramatic results .
" Sniper activity in Iraq is down by 70 % , " he says , and he 's confident that IED deaths also dropped because of the insights provided by Carley 's programs , although he can't cite data .
" It 's a simple application of metanetwork analysis , " he says .
But Sageman is skeptical that military progress in Iraq can be chalked up to network analysis .
" I 'm not convinced [ metanetworks ] have helped at all , " he says .
" An easier explanation [ for the drop in sniper attacks ] might be the tribal uprising " against the insurgency in Iraq .
" There 's no way to know , and that 's a big problem with this field in general . "
Carley counters that Sageman " does n't understand the methods . "
There is also a more subtle problem .
When you have put a lot of ideas together to make an elaborate theory , you want to make sure , when explaining what it fits , that those things it fits are not just the things that gave you the idea for the theory ; but that the finished theory makes something else come out right , in addition .
Complex - systems experts have also made contributions in epidemiology .
In 2001 , Vespignani and colleagues showed that in certain types of highly connected networks called " scale - free , " it 's impossible to stop the spread of an epidemic no matter how many people are inoculated .
Conversely , in 2003 , Shlomo Havlin , a physicist at Bar - Ilan University in Ramat Gan , Israel , and colleagues found a simple strategy for inoculating against a disease that beats picking random individuals .
By going a step further and picking randomly chosen friends of those individuals , health officials can , on average , inoculate people with more social ties through which to spread the disease .
Here 's a little exercise in scientific thinking .
What 's wrong the approach to science described in the following passage ?
( This passage , about applying network analysis to counterterrorism , is taken from the complex systems special feature in the July 24th issue of Science . ) This passage captures what is wrong with much of econophysics , systems biology , sociophysics , and almost any field that been tackled by heavily computational complex systems approaches .
Many of these researchers do n't understand what it means to test a theory .
They build these complex models , which involves making important assumptions that could easily be wrong , and then if their models fit existing data , they think the model is right .
Hence you get this McColloh guy claiming that his network analysis model was responsible for a big drop in sniper attacks , ignoring the much more obvious and plausible causes for the drop in violence : the addition of 30,000 troops and the US Military 's major new approach to counterinsurgency implemented by Petraeus .
The network researchers can't justify ruling out the more obvious explanation ; their only retort is to say that their critics do n't understand their fancy methods .
( Which is not true in many cases - there are plenty physicists , biologists , and economists who understand the mathematical / statistical / computational techniques , who are bothered by the scientific culture of complex systems research . ) This a dangerous mindset to have in science .
What these researchers are doing is practicing a sham form of science called by Feynman Cargo Cult Science
And no , that does not mean simply training your model on half of your data set and showing that you can effectively explain the other half of your data .
You need to be proactive about probing your model for problems .
So your model explains one situation well , now go find another very different situation and see how well you can explain that .
Look for predictions made by your model that have not been noted in the real - world system before , and see if your prediction is borne out .
Another example from the same issue of Science : Nowhere in the article do you read about any real - world tests of this model .
And you do n't see any real world tests in the actual research paper either .
But simply having an untested model is a ' contribution in epidemiology ' apparently worth writing about in a news feature .
At the heart of scientific thinking has to be a strong desire not to fool yourself , coupled by an understanding of how to actually put that desire into practice .
Complex systems are an important and relevant topic , but they 've been so difficult to tackle because they are messy and hard to study .
It 's difficult to find the right simplifying assumptions , and to make sure that you 've considered all of the important factors that go into the behavior of the system .
It 's so easy to be wrong .
And so it 's sad to see this emerging scientific culture that bizarrely believes that if you can produce a model that fits the data that inspired you to build the model , you 've actually shown that your model accurately captures the system .
This culture floods the scientific literature with zero-impact papers , dazzles the computationally naïve , captures a lot of air time in the news .
Here 's a prediction of my own , one that I 'm willing to put to the test : if complex systems researchers do n't get serious about the scientific method , their field is going to fizzle out , if not crash and burn .
Because in the end you have to move the field forward .
The computer models can be dazzling , but unless they produce a demonstrated string of successes that end up changing the way everyone in the field thinks - the molecular biologists , the sociologists , the economists , then the sciences of complexity will be dismissed as unfruitful .
In the end , your model has to inspire a someone to pick up a pipette and design an experiment .
I recently decided to risk life and limb by sawing open my Urban Decay Primer Potion .
Kids , do n’t try this sh*t at home !
The bright idea to try this stemmed from my desperation for Primer Potion .
My sister is out of town this week and I know I wo n’t have much time to head to Sephora to nab a new bottle and ordering online is n’t an option considering that it ’ll take days to get here !
My schedule is booked solid this week with work , life , and everything else so yesterday morning I realized I was most definately out of primer !
My god the horror of it all !
My shadow creases in a sincerely major way be it Summer or Winter but its particularly bad in the humid weather that we are having .
So as I pumped , pumped , pumped away this morning ( you know what I mean if you ’re a UD primer user ) I realized that the good old tube of primer has reached it ’s cash in date and was headed towards the rubbish bin !
My unsuspecting tube of Urban Decay Primer Potion !
When I came home later that night the bright idea to SAW open the tube came to me !
It was a like a bright light bulb going off in my head !
Of course !
I ’d just saw open the tube easily like I ’ve seen performed on other blogs and mounds of primer would await me .
Yea…right .
My ass .
Excuse my french 🙂
This is not a matter of simply sawing open the tube !
This takes some sincere sweat , blood , and tears to do !
Holy crap it was like a cardio work out just to get the bloody thing apart !
I swear I must have been there 10 minutes at least sawing away with my dull kitchen knife !
I could n’t help but think how proud freaking Michael Myers would be of me !
All yur primers are belongs to me biatch !
Tools of the trade !
Yes , this is what I used to hack the thing apart !
After narrowly missing slicing my thumb off and just grazing it enough to spurt blood all over the place I finally got the tube sliced open !
Starting to saw !
Slowing getting there !
And low and behold inside laid nirvana .
You can watch videos , you can view pictures but nothing prepares you for the first time you saw open your very own tube of Urban Decay Primer Potion .
Angels sung , birds chirped , all was right with the world again .
Holy COW !
[ email protected ] @K at all that primer !
And some more ……….
After some major scoopage !
Sincerely , there was at least enough in the upper part of the tube to last me the rest of the month if not more !
Sadly , after the workout of cutting the top half open I was n’t prepared for doing the bottom half .
It was suggested on a video tutorial to slice not only the top but the bottom as well but the Muse has an attachment to her fingers and since she survived the first round of hacking she decided it was best to call it a day !
Do I recommend slicing your tube open ?
Hells no !
This is sincerely hard , dangerous work !
I ’m thinking that $ 25 USD for a dual package of primers is n’t too bad a price to pay to keep all my fingers on one hand !
If you value your limbs I say do n’t try it !
It ’s seriously a chore and I was just desperate !
Have you ever cracked open your tube of UDPP ?
Considering it ?
Love your fingers as much as the Muse loves hers ?
Tell me all about it !
I ’m thinking next time it would be easier to get a straw , stick it in , and suck the remaining potion out !
Better ideas anyone ?
A most happy ending !

Find your blind spot
Legend has it that before an execution , King Charles II of England closed one eye and aimed his blind spot on the head of the condemned man .
This allowed Charles ’ brain to decapitate the prisoner before the axe took its turn .
In the video above , you can take advantage of this ability by “ decapitating ” author and psychologist Richard Wiseman , just as Charles II did to his victims .
When Wiseman ’s head falls into our blind spot , our brain makes sense of the mismatch by replacing his head with the yellow background .
When Wiseman raises a black bar across his body , our brain jettisons the background to avoid splitting the bar into two discontinuous halves .
Blind spots occur because of design quirk in the architecture of our eyes .
Cells at the back of the eye , in a layer called the retina , gather light focused through our lens from everything that ’s in front of us .
Advertisement
However , where a bundle of nerves connects our eyes to our brain these light - sensitive cells cannot grow .
Hence , light that hits this bundle is not sensed and a blind spot is the result .
Fortunately , our brain is good at filling in gaps in our field of vision , so even with one eye shut , we rarely notice our blind spot .

HIV is adept at evading attack by the immune system Experts believe women are naturally programmed to be the weaker sex when it comes to fighting off HIV .
It is well known that HIV progresses faster in women than in men with similar levels of HIV in the blood .
Now a US research team has found that a receptor molecule involved in the first - line recognition of HIV responds differently in women .
The findings in Nature Medicine might provide new ways to treat HIV and slow or stop the progression to Aids .
The Massachusetts General Hospital team explored whether known gender differences in the immune system might explain why HIV progresses faster in women .
They focused on immune cells called plasmacytoid dendritic cells or pDCs which are among the first cells to recognise and fight HIV .
Lab studies showed that a higher percentage of these cells from healthy , uninfected women became activated when presented with HIV - 1 as compared with pDCs from healthy men .
Next they studied whether a woman 's hormone levels might be involved .
Hormonal link
They found that pDCs from older women who had gone through the menopause had similar activity to that observed in men .
But premenopausal women with higher levels of the hormone progesterone had increased activation of pDCs in response to HIV - 1 .
Armed with this knowledge they then tested whether this increased activation of pDCs , in turn , led to activation of other immune cells called T cells .
Whilst there are some genetic differences based on sex , access to treatment remains the single most important factor in preventing HIV from progressing to Aids
Jo Robinson from Terrence Higgins Trust
When they tested the blood of men and women with HIV - 1 they found the women did have higher levels of activated CD8 - positive T cells than men with identical blood levels of HIV - 1 .
Lead researcher Dr Marcus Altfeld said : " While stronger activation of the immune system might be beneficial in the early stages of infection , resulting in lower levels of HIV - 1 replication , persistent viral replication and stronger chronic immune activation can lead to the faster progression of Aids that has been seen in women . "
Ultimately , drugs that work to modify this pathway might help patients with HIV , he said .
His team is beginning preliminary laboratory studies into this .
Jo Robinson from Terrence Higgins
Trust said : " This is an interesting piece of research exploring whether HIV progresses faster in women than in men .
" Whilst there are some genetic differences based on sex , access to treatment remains the single most important factor in preventing HIV from progressing to Aids .
" Unfortunately women are most likely to be affected by the virus in places like sub-Saharan Africa , where they are also least likely to be able to access HIV treatment . "

Matt Taibbi ’s vampire - squid piece has apparently lit a bonfire under the asses of Goldman Sachs bashers everywhere .
Not - so - flattering pieces on GS are popping up everywhere .
Outlets like Huffington Post , True Slant , and Mother Jones are officially all - over this topic .
Even the smallest slip - ups and conflicts of interest are getting in - depth coverage ( at least in non-traditional media ) .
A welcome change , to say the least .
For example : On Friday I counted 8 Goldman - critical pieces on Huff Po ’s biz home page simultaneously .
A blog - search for “ goldman sachs ” on google will provide hundreds more examples .
Mainstream outlets like Time are even getting in on it ( in a more restrained way ) , with pieces like this one , which was featured on Yahoo ’s homepage yesterday , “ Goldman Sachs ’ Financial Boom : A Political Mess for Obama ? ”
I think Bearish News has published some decent dirt on Goldman in our day , done our share of muckraking .
So in the spirit of a good old - fashioned dogpile , I present our finest Goldman Sachs material in chronological order .
Skip the first few if you follow this stuff obsessively .
But # 4 and # 6 might surprise even veteran GS conspiracy - theorists .
# 1 ( 1/28/09 ) – Geithner ’s Chief of Staff is Ex-Goldman – “ No conflict of interest there .
Mr. Geithner ’s pick , Mark Patterson , just left Goldman in April .
I had hoped for a more unbiased team from Mr. Obama .
But this seems like a blatant departure from his pledge to exclude lobbyists from areas where they would be biased . ”
# 2 ( 3/03/09 ) – Goldman Sachs ’ Mysterious 2008 Tax Rate – “ If they are dodging taxes , the testicular fortitude of these guys is truly impressive .
They ’re taking taxpayer dollars via the bailouts , shifting profits overseas to avoid paying any taxes , then awarding themselves generous bonuses . ”
# 3 ( 3/03/09 ) – Fox News : “ Goldman Sachs Executives Gifted with Public Purpose ” – That ’s the real title of a 2006 Fox News article praising the revolving door between GS and high - government office .
# 4 ( 4/17/09 ) – Goldman Squeezes SPG Shorts – Angry rant after GS squeezed a stock I was short ( Simon Property ) .
I found some dirt on previous SEC wrist - slaps for similar actions in the past ( all alleged , I have no proof of course ) .
# 5 ( 4/21/09 ) – Selected History of GS Conviction Buy List – Some of the horrible conviction buy calls made by GS , with price at time of the call .
# 6 ( 5/09/09 ) – Henry Paulson ’s $ 200 m Tax Shelter – Paulson used a little - known rule to unload his $ 700 m in Goldman stock with zero capital gains when he became Treasury Secretary .
This was to ensure that Paulson was free from conflicts of interest .
Hah . ha .
Ugh .
I ’m trying not to get my hopes up for any meaningful justice taking place .
But the public outrage is really reaching a fever - pitch .
Max Kaiser was just on French TV openly calling GS execs scum and calling for them ( the whole bunch , I presume ? ) to be thrown in jail .
Ray Kurzweil has a surrealist 's eye for disorientation .
The lobby of his offices outside Boston have the quality of a Dadaist art gallery : nothing is quite what it seems .
Immediately inside the door is an old metal box that turns out to be a dictation machine built by Thomas Edison .
An old man is sitting next to it , with a badge on his lapel that reads : " I'm an inventor " .
He is George , the receptionist tells me , and he is made of wax .
A cabinet along the hall is covered entirely in boxes of vitamin pills , hundreds of them , from acai berry , red yeast rice and milk thistle to a very large jar marked " Anti-ageing multi- pack " .
The sensation of strangeness intensifies inside Kurzweil 's personal office .
Several handwritten placards are stacked against the wall .
" NO RIGHTS FOR BOTS ! " says one .
An oil painting of a white rabbit and a drawing of Jerry Garcia of the Grateful Dead are propped up against the desk , which is lined with dozens of volumes of the Tom Swift children 's adventure series .
Then Kurzweil himself flurries into the room , half an hour late , looking flustered .
He starts an instant banter with the photographer , informing him that the white rabbit is a representation of virtual reality and an allusion to the psychedelic song by Jefferson Airplane .
The Tom Swift books , he adds , were his favourite reading when he was seven .
It 's all getting a little too weird , and the interview has n't even begun yet .
Let 's begin with the uncontested facts .
Ray Kurzweil is an inventor of considerable repute , an expert on the information technology revolution and the future of artificial intelligence .
As a young man he put together some of the earliest electronic keyboards and created a machine that can scan and read printed literature to blind people - the first customer was Stevie Wonder , who has become a lifelong friend .
He boasts countless awards , is in the US inventors hall of fame , has written several New York Times bestsellers , and sits on the board of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
He is the subject of a documentary , Transcendent Man , that will be released this year and is completing his own film , The Singularity is Near .
And lest any doubt about his standing remains , Bill Gates regards him as the " best person I know at predicting the future of artificial intelligence " .
To cap all that , a new university opening next month will be named after one of his key theories .
Sponsored by Google , the Singularity University will be housed on the Silicon Valley campus of Nasa .
It will bring together some of the biggest names in frontier disciplines such as bio- and nano - technology , neuroscience and artificial intelligence .
The university will open its doors in July to 40 students paying $ 25,000 ( £ 17,000 ) each for a nine - week course .
Their challenge will be to come up with new ideas addressing some of the world 's most pressing problems .
On the agenda : climate change , world poverty and hunger .
Were the story of Ray Kurzweil to end at this point , we would be left with an impressive though not wildly out of the ordinary technology pioneer .
But Kurzweil is anything but ordinary .
Take what he tells me about the prospects for medical intervention .
With the completion of the human genome , he says , health and medicine have become a branch of information technology .
" We have now the software of life - the code that underlines it .
We have tools now to change the software .
How often do you go without updating the software on your cellphone ?
Probably not more than a couple of weeks as it updates automatically .
When was the last time you updated the software running in your body ?
It is out of date . "
In the land of Kurzweil , the possibility of reprogramming the body is not a dry academic theory , it is a blueprint for how to lead your life .
That 's why he has a cabinet covered in vitamin boxes , including those anti-ageing packs .
He has turned himself into a living medical experiment with the hope - more than that , the expectation - that it will allow him to live far into the distant future and perhaps forever .
Every day he takes about 150 supplements with the aim of reprogramming his biochemistry .
Once a week he spends a day at a health clinic having particular compounds fed into him intravenously .
What on earth does he do that for ?
The answer is that though he turned 61 on Thursday , he believes that physically he is preserving himself to be much younger .
" How old am I really ?
I 've stayed around 40 .
I was 38 biologically when I was 40 , and I 'm 40 or 41 today .
There is a biological ageing test and that 's what it registers for me . "
White rabbits , Grateful Dead , 61 - year - olds with the biology of someone two decades their junior .
Is now the time to terminate the interview and run screaming out of the office ?
He calmly insists that his pursuit of youth is quite logical .
" People ask me whether I think taking all these supplements will allow me to live hundreds of years .
No .
The point is only to stay in good shape another 15 years or so before we have developed the ability to reprogram our biology through nanotechnology using nanobots - blood - cell sized devices in our bloodstream that will keep us healthy . "
Does he really want to live forever ?
Would n't the thrill of life start to fade after a few thousand years or so ?
" If the future remained the same and no new ideas or experiences happened then ultimately we'd grow weary .
But that is not the case .
The future is going to be a very exciting place , and that 's why I 'd like to stick around to see it . "
The burning sense of the future 's potential has been with him since a very early age .
He decided to be an inventor when he was five , he says .
" My parents provided me with all these erector sets and construction toys , and I had the idea that if you put these parts together you could create transcendent effects .
I did n't have that vocabulary , but I did have the feeling that you could do magical things and solve problems . "
From the age of seven he began reading those Tom Swift books , devouring one after another .
Each book , with titles like Tom Swift and His Airship and Tom Swift and His Wireless Message , has an identical plot : the world is faced with an existential crisis ;
Tom goes into the basement of his house and tinkers with some gadgets ;
Tom emerges with an invention that will save the day .
For Tom Swift read Ray Kurzweil .
By the age of 13 he was designing software .
While still a teenager he was setting up companies to exploit his ideas , and selling them for large sums .
His urge to invent was insatiable , and it led him to an obsession with futurology .
It began mundanely .
To maximise the profit from his inventions he started to study technology trends in an attempt to divine the best moment to launch any new product .
In the process , he made what he considers an extraordinary discovery : that the trajectory of new technologies was astonishingly predictable .
More importantly , the graph they followed was not linear , as most people thought , but exponential .
" Most people 's expectation of the future is that the current pace will continue , despite the fact that the power of technology is doubling every year . "
This was his eureka moment , and in his view it revolutionises everything .
He uses the example of a person walking a certain distance .
If the person takes 30 linear steps - 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 - they travel 30 units .
But if those steps are exponential - 2 , 4 , 8 , 16 , 32 - they reach 1 billion .
So it is with technology .
" When I was an undergraduate at MIT we shared one computer that took up a whole building .
The cellphone in your pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times more powerful .
That 's a billion times the sales performance - and we 'll do it again in the next 25 years . "
This identification of the exponential growth in technological firepower , coupled with a fervent belief that there is no problem that cannot be solved through its application , is the key to Kurzweil .
It unlocked his predictions of the coming of the internet , the fall of the Soviet Union partly as a result of the spread of communications , and the defeat of the world chess champion by a computer ( he was a year out - in the 1980s he predicted 1998 ; Garry Kasparov lost to Deep Blue in 1997 ) .
Exponential growth also lies at the heart of his aspirations for the new Singularity University .
Through it he wants to pursue solar energy as a solution to climate change .
" Right now about half a percent of the world 's energy needs are from solar , so people say ' Oh , that 's not a big deal ' .
But solar has doubled every two years - and it's only eight doublings away from 100 % .
In 20 years it could meet all the world 's energy needs . "
Similarly , Kurzweil detects in the explosion of cellphone use across Africa the opportunity to combat illness and hunger .
He wants to design software that could be downloaded on to all African cellphones that would easily diagnose and provide remedial directions for leading local diseases .
Listening to Kurzweil 's high - velocity monologue , it 's almost shocking how optimistic he is .
After the 20th century 's disasters with centralised planning , and this century 's disasters involving terrorism and the black hole of the financial system , it 's not fashionable to talk about the inevitable march of progress .
But Kurzweil is unwavering .
" People very often do n't realise how far we 've come .
Think of the improvements that we 've seen : human life expectancy was 37 in 1800 , 48 in 1900 ... "
And in 2035 ?
His prediction in that regard is that by 2029 computers will be able to pass the Turing test - that is , pass themselves off as human in conversation .
Soon after that the " singularity " will have been reached , the point at which artificial intelligence will so far exceed the human brain that ordinary mortals will no longer be able to keep up .
By 2035 the human brain and computers will begin to merge - literally .
Those nanobots will be used to vastly extend the reach of human intelligence .
They will allow us to control all our senses by computer and enter a full virtual reality in which we could become other people .
( Ray tells me that since the age of eight his fantasy has been to become a female rock singer called Ramona . )
Kurzweil predicts looming human protests against the granting of legal rights to human - computer mergers , which explains the " NO RIGHTS FOR BOTS ! " placard in his office : it was a prop used in his forthcoming film .
The problem with the more outlandish side of his thinking is that it has earned him a reputation for crankiness that in turn casts a shadow over his genuinely important work .
As one critic put it : " It 's as if you took a lot of very good food and some dog excrement and blended it all up so that you can't possibly figure out what 's good or bad . "
Surely he resents such comments , and the damage to his overall standing ?
" I'm not uncomfortable with the controversy , " he replies .
" It 's part of the process new ideas have to go through . "
I leave Kurzweil 's cluttered office carrying enough food for thought to last me , oh , at least a couple of hundred years .
Is it time to start popping those pills ?
On the plane back to New York I open one of his books and read the inscription he has written inside .
" To Ed , to a ( very ) long and healthy life .
Ray . "
The eureka moments
1963 Aged 15 , Kurzweil wrote his first computer program to help alleviate boredom .
It was picked up by IBM
1965 Developed a program that wrote music in the style of famous composers
1974 - 6 Designed the first computer program that could understand letter shapes in any font , wrote a program that converted scanned text into synthesised speech , and then combined the two inventions to create the Kurzweil reading machine .
This " read " printed text aloud through a voice synthesiser , for the use of blind people .
First customer : Stevie Wonder .
The machine was as big as a table ; now it fits in the pocket
1984 Perfected the electronic keyboard .
Used sampling of the sounds of instruments to produce rich authentic reproductions of the entire orchestra .
His Kurzweil K250 is used by Keith Emerson , Herbie Hancock , Eric Clapton and others
1987 Invented a program that does the reverse of his reading machine - converting a person 's spoken voice into type
Cameron is the offspring of father Michael and his first wife Diandra Luker Actor Michael Douglas says his family is " devastated " by the arrest of his son on drugs charges .
Cameron Douglas , 30 , was arrested in Manhattan on 28 July and accused of selling methamphetamine .
" The family is devastated and very disappointed in Cameron 's recent behaviour , " said Michael and his former wife Diandra Luker in a statement .
" Any family who has dealt with substance abuse knows how devastating it can be , " they added .
The statement was released to US magazine People .
Smuggling arrest Cameron Douglas faces a minimum 10 - year jail sentence and a maximum of life if convicted of charges that he sold thousands of dollars worth of methamphetamine , also known as Crystal Meth .
He was arrested at a Manhattan hotel , and prosecutors allege he shipped large quantities of the drug from California to New York using the courier service Federal Express .
The 30 - year - old , who had been confined to an apartment after his arrest , was transferred to jail this week after his girlfriend , Kelly Sott , allegedly tried to smuggle heroin to him .
According to court documents , a security guard overheard Douglas ask for a toothbrush on Monday , which his girlfriend delivered to him later that day .
A guard opened the battery compartment of the toothbrush and found " a brownish substance that appeared to be heroin , " the federal complaint said .
A field test showed it was about seven grams of the drug .
Sott was subsequently arrested .
Cameron Douglas appeared with his father Michael and grandfather Kirk in the film It Runs in the Family in 2003 , a comedy showing three generations of a dysfunctional family .
His other films are Adam and Eve , The Perfect Beat and Loaded , with Jesse Metcalfe and Chace Crawford .
His most recent project , the crime drama Beautiful Outsiders with Corey Feldman , sees Douglas both in front of and behind the camera as associate producer .
The film is still in production .

I spent a little time earlier today clarifying the Fedora project ‘s support for the Haskell Platform .
You can read the details here ; the summary is that we ’re currently four packages short of complete support for the current release of the Haskell Platform .
You can install the whole lot with a single copy - and - paste to your command line , no manual build or dependency installation required .
With any luck , if we can get things complete , this will spur the Debian ( and by extension , Ubuntu ) Haskell team into finishing off their support for the Platform , in the spirit of friendly competition .
That would leave us in the delicious situation of being able to tell curious people that almost any major Linux distro will make a good basis for developing and deploying Haskell applications .
Sweet !
In July of 1981 , a group of individuals who would later be known as ‘ gamers ’ began funneling quarters into arcade machines to play what would be the first true platforming game called Donkey Kong .
Over the years , the genre for this type of game would boom , spawning new franchises and characters trademarked by their abilities to run , jump , climb and float .
The 2D platformer was what most early gamers think of when they hark back to old school gaming and the memories it brings .
From this genre stemmed action games , sidescrollers and other variations of interactions the game character could perform .
Super Mario , Contra , Ninja Gaiden – all two - dimensional titles featuring obstacles and enemies that involved movement .
When home consoles reached a point where creators could take their platformers into the 3D realm , titles like Super Mario 64 , Crash Bandicoot , and Sonic Adventure allowed gamers to employ similar tactics to achieve common goals .
But then , at the turn of the new millennium , this once prominent game genre started to decline , all but disappearing on the next generation of powerful consoles .
The video games industry has since boomed adapting into a new markets and channels reserved for other forms of entertainment .
So what happened ?
Something must have taken their place .
The early platformers were restricted to two - dimensions for simple hardware constraints .
It was a new genre on an unprecedented technology .
No one had done this before .
Same goes for the style of gameplay .
Movement , timing , skill – all learned not instilled .
In the early 80 ’s , there were few hardcore gamers .
No one was a master of a genre that had just been created .
Everyone started at level one .
The video games taught players these skills , and soon people were capable of building upon past experience when translating to newer games .
1993 saw the evolution of the game industry with the first - person shooter Doom .
A genre previously monopolized by PC gamers , it soon spread to consoles with the influential release of Rare ’s Golden Eye for the N64 .
Building upon gamers ’ already adapted timing and hand eye coordination , the FPS provided a more involving experience .
Moving in the 3D space was fluid and natural to gamers because of its realism .
The idea of holding a gun was arguably the most basic sense to any adolescent boy .
The genre was able to capitalize on where the platformer was unfamiliar – familiarity .
Gamers might not be able to associate their experiences to trampeling Goombas or spinning through turtles , but the act of holding a gun , firing , and dodging oncoming fire was one that was easy to pick up .
More than just their ease of playability , gamers could create their own styles of play .
One individual could be more skilled at headshots , another strafing .
Mixing together skills took more creativity than mere timing alone .
Movement was as paramount as aiming .
A player dead center in a room could have the greatest aim in the world and still wind up dead surrounded by enemies .
This was the key factor that lead to their success .
Coupled with humanity ’s natural desire to destroy , maim and watch stuff go boom , the FPS genre overtook the platformer as evident today .
The most influential games in our modern day are shooters .
From 1997 to 2008 , as voted by secret ballot from the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences , 7 of the 12 Game of the Year winners have been shooters .
Today , more and more genres are adopting the shooter ’s mechanics to attract new gamers .
Mass Effect and Fallout 3 – two role - playing games from well respected developers both feature prominent shooter elements .
No matter your playing style , there ’s always an option to just go the traditional shooter route .
Ratchet & Clank , a series that features gratuitous amounts of platforming also employs a wide variety of guns and projectiles with which to dispatch enemies .
Naughty Dog , developer of Crash Bandicoot , a popular 3D platformer , later created Jak & Daxter which was a more advanced game in the same vein .
Its second and third iterations however saw the series adopt gunplay , arguably to capitalize on some of the success Ratchet & Clank garnered from its usage .
Now the company creates acclaimed title Uncharted , a hybrid of platformer , but more or less a shooter from the third person .
It ’s clear that hardware limitations were not the driving force behind the dispatch of the common platformer .
Gamers decided which titles they wanted to see more of and the developers agreed .
Although not everyone may be happy with the way things have turned out .
More and more titles with shooter elements are released year after year , but how can you really complain when some of the best games employ this mechanic ?
Gamers from the previous era will undoubtedly hold the memory of the jumping man in their hearts .
Tomorrow is another day , and the next great game mechanic is waiting to be found .

Fuzzyeyes Studio was recently threatened with legal action by colossal asshat , Tim Langdell of Edge Games , because he was n’t pleased with a certain word being present in the title of their upcoming game , Edge of Twilight .
See , Mr. Langdell has n’t actually made a game for decades , but he delights in antagonizing and threatening honest developers who use any form of “ Edge ” in the titles of their games .
Even though Edge of Twilight has been in development since 2007 , that did n’t stop ol ’
Tim from rushing to trademark the phrase “ Edge of Twilight ” this year , presumably so he could throw a cease - and - desist their way .
Earlier today , Fuzzyeyes Studio CEO Wei -Yao
Lu let us know that they were going ahead with the original title .
Said Lu :
Through amicable negotiations , Fuzzyeyes and Edge Games have arrived at a satisfactory arrangement that addresses the concerns of both parties .
This arrangement allows the highly anticipated Edge of Twilight to proceed with its title unchanged , and without infringement on any trademarks held by Edge Games .
I just hope “ amicable negotiations ” is code for “ 45 minutes of punching Tim Langdell in the balls . ”

* WHO says pointless to count individual cases
* But countries should track deaths , unusual patterns
GENEVA ( Reuters ) - The World Health Organization ( WHO ) said on Thursday that the H1N1 flu pandemic was the fastest - moving pandemic ever and that it was now pointless to count every case .
The United Nations agency , which declared an influenza pandemic on June 11 , revised its requirements so that national health authorities need only report clusters of severe cases or deaths caused by the new virus or unusual clinical patterns .
“ The 2009 influenza pandemic has spread internationally with unprecedented speed .
In past pandemics , influenza viruses have needed more than six months to spread as widely as the new H1N1 virus has spread in less than six weeks , ” it said in a statement on the new strain , commonly known as swine flu .
It has become nearly impossible for health authorities and laboratories to keep count of individual cases -- which have mostly been mild -- as the virus spreads , according to the 193 member - state agency .
The new flu strain can be treated by antivirals such as Roche Holding ’s Tamiflu or GlaxoSmithKline ’s Relenza , but many patients recover without medical treatment .
Flu experts say at least a million people are infected in the United States alone , and the WHO says the pandemic is unstoppable .
“ It is very much agreed that trying to register and report every single case is a huge waste of resources , ” WHO spokesman Gregory Hartl said .
Such tracking has limited authorities ’ capacity to investigate serious cases and is no longer essential to monitor the level or nature of the risk posed by the virus , WHO said .
However , all countries should still closely monitor unusual clusters of severe or fatal infections from the pandemic virus , clusters of respiratory illness requiring hospitalization or unexplained or unusual clinical patterns .
“ Signals to be vigilant for include spikes in rates of absenteeism from schools or workplaces , or a more severe disease pattern , as suggested by , for example , a surge in emergency department visits , ” it said .
Britain reported on Thursday that 29 people had died to date after contracting the virus .
Health Minister Andy Burnham said this month the government was projecting more than 100,000 new cases a day of the flu in the country by the end of August .
The WHO will no longer issue global tables showing the numbers of confirmed cases for all countries -- which stood at 94,512 cases with 429 deaths as of its last update on July 6 .
Instead , it will issue regular updates on the situation in newly affected countries , which should report the first confirmed cases , weekly figures and epidemiological details .
Countries should still test a limited number of virus samples weekly to confirm that disease is actually due to the pandemic virus and to monitor any virological changes that may be important for the development of vaccines , it said .
At least 50 governments have placed orders for vaccines against the new H1N1 strain or negotiating with drug makers , WHO vaccine chief Marie - Paule Kieny told Reuters .
The WHO does not report figures for cases of seasonal influenza , which it says is linked to 250,000 to 500,000 deaths a year globally .

Americans at Risk : One in Three Uninsured
Copies of reports for each state , in pdf format , can be found here .
Every year , the U.S. Census Bureau — in its Current Population Survey ( CPS ) — reports the number of people who are uninsured .
This widely quoted number is intended to offer an estimate of how many people did not have any type of health insurance at any point in time during the previous calendar year .
There are many people , however , who are uninsured for a portion of a year but not for the entire year .
Though these individuals may suffer severe consequences to their health and their economic well - being as a result of being uninsured , they are not included in the Census Bureau ’s number .
In March 2009 , Families USA released a new report , Americans at Risk : One in Three Uninsured , which was designed to provide a comprehensive picture of how many Americans were directly affected by the lack of health coverage in 2007 - 2008 .
That report contains national data , as well as a detailed discussion of the methodology .
The following is a spreadsheet I put together with data from each state report :
* Number & percent refer to people under the age of 65 ( i.e. , those not eligible for Medicare ) who were uninsured for part or all of the period 2007 - 2008 .
Massachusetts is not included due to its state law mandating all citizens purchase insurance .
More information on Massachusetts can be found here .
The totals are startling : 86.7 million people under the age of 65 went without health insurance for all or part of 2007 - 2008 .
This represents 33.1 % of the population under the age of 65 .
Of this 86.7 million , 74.5 % went without coverage for at least six months .
Too Great a Burden : Americans Face Rising Health Care Costs
Key findings and report can be found here .
State - by - state reports can be found by scrolling down through the Families USA archives .
Long before the current economic crisis began , Americans were already straining under the burden of two related trends : shrinking coverage and rising health care costs .
Over the last decade , millions of Americans have joined the ranks of the uninsured , and millions more have become underinsured as the value of their coverage has declined .
At the same time , health insurance premiums and out - of - pocket costs have risen steadily , and the number of families who are facing unmanageably high health care costs has grown .
Left unchecked , health care costs will keep going up , forcing more and more American families into debt — and even into bankruptcy and foreclosure .
To better understand the magnitude of the health care cost crisis , Families USA commissioned The Lewin Group to analyze data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the U.S. Census Bureau that reveal how many Americans face very high health care costs .
This analysis allowed us to determine how many non-elderly people are in families that will spend more than 10 percent of their pre-tax income , and more than 25 percent of their pre-tax income , on health care in 2009 .
Our analysis paints a stark picture : Nearly one in four Americans under the age of 65 — some 64.4 million people — will spend more than 10 percent of their family income on health care in 2009 .
The vast majority of these people ( 82.6 percent ) have health insurance .
And 18.7 million non-elderly Americans — more than three - quarters of whom have health insurance — are in families that will spend more than 25 percent of their income on health care in 2009 .
This report has findings both on people belonging to families who do n't have insurance and people belonging to families that do have insurance .
For each group , Families USA has compiled data on how many families are spending more than 10 % of their pre-tax income on health care costs and how many families are spending more than 25 % of their pre-tax income on health care costs .
While the numbers are unsurprisingly more dire for those without insurance , I 'm going to include here charts regarding those who have insurance for the following reasons :
A ) Because nobody wants me to include 8 bazillion charts ( or , most people do n't - if you want more charts follow my links ) .
B ) It is critical that we inform people who have insurance in this country how much their situation is on thin ice , and that their out - of - pocket costs are going to continue to rise while the comprehensiveness of their coverage drops .
C ) People who do n't have insurance know how awful their situation is , and for the most part want a public option .
Further , the key findings of this report , in addition to the findings of other reports I mention here , speak to the situation of those who are ( like myself ) uninsured .
This first chart has numbers on insured people in families spending more than 10 % of their pre-tax income on health care in 2000 and in 2009 :
This second chart has numbers on insured people in families spending more than 25 % of their pre-tax income on health care in 2000 and 2009 :
The reports in this group offer a wealth of information and are worth looking through .
Data is provided for a variety of demographics , including families that do and do not have elderly members .
No matter the demographic , the result is clear : health care costs continue to rise substantially , eating up a larger and larger portion of family income , even for those who have insurance .
One state that jumps out at me here is Montana .
Only five other states are above the 30 % mark for families with insurance paying more than 10 % of pre-tax income for health care , and only one other state is above the 10 % mark for families with insurance paying more than 25 % of pre-tax income for health care .
In other words : Montana is the worst off state in terms of how much of their income insured families are paying for health care .
And yet Max Baucus is more interested in helping his insurance company campaign donors than the people of his state who are suffering so greatly .
The Clock Is Ticking : More Americans Losing Health Coverage
This report is only available via direct download , and
provides the first ever state - by - state data on the number of people who may lose health coverage between the beginning of 2008 and the end of 2010 .
Numbers are broken down per week , per month , and per year .
And yet we 're told by Republicans that it 's only illegal immigrants , homeless people who have n't signed up to get the assistance available to them , or people who have plenty of money around but decide they do n't want to pay for insurance , who are going without insurance these days .
All the rest of us who have been laid off , or who work hourly wage jobs with no benefits and who get paid just barely enough that we do n't qualify for Medicaid , or who work temp jobs when we can get it , or who work part time , we 're all apparently non-existent .
My own situation ?
I work 24 hours a week .
I make just enough that I do n't qualify for Medicaid .
Over the last year I 've been unemployed almost half the time and have had temp jobs a little more than half the time .
This is all the work I 've been able to find .
I can't possibly afford insurance , yet I get zero help .
Are Republicans willing to acknowledge that I deserve health care ?
Or are they supposing that I should n't have bothered working at all ?
I 'm fortunate to have found the work that I 've found , but I am still without insurance .
What is it that they would have me do ?
Conjure jobs out of thin air ?
Would that I could !
Alas , Albus Dumbledore I am not .
Costly Coverage : Premiums Outpace Paychecks
Copies of reports for each state , in pdf format , can be found here .
These reports specifically look at premiums for families , and compare the increase in those family premiums with the rise in median income .
And , surprise surprise , health insurance rates have skyrocketed compared to average wage increases .
On average , for the 18 states reported on so far , family premiums increased 4.4 times as much as median wages between 2000 and 2009 .
The following is a spreadsheet I put together to summarize the results of each report :
[ ratio is how many times faster premiums have risen compared to wages ]
As has been pointed out briefly , though not nearly enough , by the president , the average worker who gets health insurance through their employer might not realize that the skyrocketing costs of insurance are having an effect on them because they think , " Oh , well who cares ?
I 'm paid for . "
Yet that same worker has not seen the kinds of raises that they would have otherwise earned without their employer having to continually front more and more money for health care .
Additionally , many workers have seen their co-pays and deductibles rise with the perpetual increase in premium costs , and still others have had the comprehensiveness of their plan reduced in order for their employer to be able to afford the coverage .
It should be fairly obvious that this trend is nowhere near sustainable .
The American small business owner is going to find it near impossible in coming years to provide health coverage to their employees , if they already do n't .
And America 's larger employers are not going to be as competitive in the marketplace as foreign firms because of the incredibly high cost of providing health insurance to their employees .
Beyond the already widely made arguments for a public option ( choice ) , those who are currently covered by their employer should realize the benefits a public plan will have to their own future , and the future their children and grandchildren :
Increased wages as businesses become more profitable .
The ability of small businesses to provide for their people .
Increased competitiveness of American businesses in the global marketplace .
Consistently comprehensive coverage provided by their employer , with low deductibles and co-pays .
It is imperative to the prosperity of the American economy as a whole , and to the average American worker , that a public option ( choice ) be introduced to make businesses more competitive and to provide a better livelihood for employees .
Without a public plan our economy is going to continue to suffer in the long - run under the weight of a gigantic health care burden .
Honduras Coup : A Template
for Hemispheric Assault on Democracy
By Felipe Stuart Cournoyer
August 7 , 2009
The people of Honduras have now suffered more than 40 days of military rule .
The generals ’
June 28 coup , crudely re-packaged in constitutional guise , ousted the country ’s elected government and unleashed severe , targeted , and relentless repression .
The grassroots protests have matched the regime in endurance and outmatched it in political support within the country and internationally .
Its scope and duration is unprecedented in Honduras history .
Popular resistance is the main factor affecting the international forces attempting to shape the outcome of the governmental crisis .
It weighs heavy on the minds of the coup ’s authors and their international backers .
As Eva Golinger has convincingly documented , the United States took part in conceiving , planning , and staging the coup .
( See www.chavezcode.com/ . )
The U.S. ambassador in Tegucigalpa , Hugo Llorens , coordinates a team of high - ranking U.S. and Honduran military officials , and creatures from the old Bush administration , using the Soto Cano ( Palmerola ) U.S. air force base .
But when the army assaulted President Zelaya ’s house , machine guns blazing , kidnapped him , and dumped him – still in pajamas – in Costa Rica , this forged unprecedented unity in Latin America and the Caribbean against the coup regime , and enraged hundreds of thousands within the country .
Latin American unity
In the first days after the coup , it appeared that the whole world was coming out against the Honduran generals and their civilian front men .
ALBA – the nine - nation Bolivarian alliance initiated by Venezuela and Cuba – took the initiative in uniting Latin American governments around a common stand .
Nicaragua ’s capital , Managua , became the temporary capital of Our America .
Many Latin American presidents knew only too - well that they could soon suffer Zelaya ’s fate .
Argentina ’s Cristina Fermandez devoted her entire speech to this theme at the OAS general assembly , which took a unanimous stand against the golpistas ( coupsters ) .
That was followed quickly by a UN General Assembly meeting , convened by its president Father Miguel d’Escoto ( a veteran Nicaraguan Sandinista leader ) , which also passed a unanimous resolution repudiating the coup and recognizing Zelaya as the legitimate president of Honduras .
Faced with this reality , the U.S. government hastened to portray itself as a key opponent of the military take - over and a supporter of Zelaya ’s return .
It was politically urgent for the Obama regime , not only in Latin America but domestically , to disclaim involvement in the coup .
There has been much speculation that Obama may disagree with his government ’s duplicitous policy on the coup .
That can of course not be excluded .
But what counts for the people of Honduras and their supporters is not Obama ’s possible private opinions but his government ’s actions .
Its walk betrayed its pronouncements .
The U.S. has not acted to cut the legs out from under the coup regime .
It could topple the coup through a five - minute phone call that included a few bottom - line dollar figures .
Its words , as time has shown , were mainly those of deceit and of manipulation of different forces acting on the Honduran crisis .
Main aims of the coup
Washington staged the coup to promote a number of closely interacting aims :
To strike a blow at the ALBA alliance , by taking out its assumed “ weakest link ” – Honduras , and its member government headed by Zelaya .
To prepare for an assault on revolutionary Venezuela , prefaced through the announcement of new U.S. military basis that will convert Colombia into a gigantic aircraft carrier and platform for staging hostile operations against ALBA countries , with Ecuador and Bolivia also high up on the list .
To “ take back ” Honduras , and again use it as a platform to strike out against leftwing presidencies and mass movements in Guatemala , El Salvador , and Nicaragua , and to demoralize and discourage the grassroots support for those disobedient or defiant regimes .
To test Latin America ’s turbulent waters for a revival of coup - making in Latin America and the Caribbean .
And , to use it as a laboratory for coup - making under present 21st - Century conditions .
This involves attempting to re-inspire and regroup rightwing supporters in both political and military spheres across the hemisphere .
It also took a measure of where the powerful Catholic Church would fall .
A free Bible if you guess right .
To probe South America ’s “ soft underbelly ” – mainly Brazil and Chile – to see if they were amenable to a deal , or at least if their silence could be purchased .
This involves an effort to drive a wedge between the ALBA Alliance and so - called centre - left regimes ( Argentina , Brazil , Paraguay , Uruguay , and Chile ) .
Since then , a lot of water has gone down the Rio Coco ( between Honduras and Nicaragua ) .
The coup regime threatened to become a millstone around Washington ’s neck and hinder its renewed drive to find leverage and points of support , especially in South America .
Hence Washington ’s efforts for plausible denial with no qualms about letting the golpistas hang out to dry if necessary .
Events over the past months show some success for Washington , but mainly on the international level .
Latin American unity , for example is now being sorely tested by the provocative decision to place U.S. military air and naval bases in Colombia .
While both Brazil and Chile have reluctantly bowed down with the argument the issue is a " sovereign " decision for Colombia , others like Bolivia , Nicaragua , Ecuador , Uruguay , Venezuela , and Cuba have denounced the measure .
An effective resistance
Meanwhile , the Honduran resistance has had immense impact on the population , the regime , the national and regional economy , and international opinion .
This outcome is horrifying to the local ruling class and to Washington .
The Honduran economy is in tatters .
Estimates indicate that import - export activity is down by 60 per cent .
Zelaya reported in a press conference in Mexico City that over 200 road barricades had been erected , most of them heavily repressed by the army in an attempt to keep produce moving .
Public schools have not functioned since the coup because of teachers ’ strikes and student boycotts .
Health workers have maintained a long strike , and many other work centres have been hit by shorter strikes and slowdowns .
The de facto government has been unable to meet payrolls , and profits of the ten ruling families are starting to dry up .
ADIDAS , NIKE , and GAP – flagships of the maquila sector – have urged the U.S. government to accelerate Zelaya ’s return because its products are not being exported .
They are suffering losses in the millions .
The crisis is also hitting hard Nicaraguan and El Salvadoran import - export enterprises that depend on the northern Honduran port of Cortés for commerce with the eastern and southern U.S. and with Europe .
Yet despite stiff resistance and surprises on the international front , de facto President Roberto Micheletti’s “ government ” has not collapsed .
Its main weapon , aside from Catholic Church sermons and virtual monopoly control over media , has been targeted killings and arrests of unarmed protesters , who take nothing into their actions but conviction , courage , and picket signs .
Disappearances and torture are selectively carried out , the right to free circulation permanently violated , curfews often lengthened .
The regime has now moved to close down Globo Radio , the only station that has dared to oppose the coup , support Zelaya as the country ’s legitimate president , and give the resistance a voice .
It is still on the air as of August 6 .
Hundreds of supporters have surrounded it with defense guards .
If the regime hangs on , it will likely also close down TV Cholusat Sur ( Channel 36/34 ) which works hand - in - glove with Globo .
The Arias Plan
The plan of Costa Rican President Oscar Arias for surmounting the coup and restoring “ stability ” to Honduras is misnamed .
It should be called the “ Obama - Clinton - Lula Plan . ” Santiago O'Donnell , regular journalist for the Argentine Pagina 12 , wrote on July 26 that the Arias Plan was traced out in a Moscow meeting between Lula and Obama .
" Lula wanted Zelaya to return but Obama did n't want him to stay on , so they agreed in Moscow that Zelaya should return but remain " [ with any real power ] -- see Made in Washington , http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/elmundo/4-128866-2009-07-26.html .
The plan 's evident , but unstated intent was to marginalize Zelaya from any real power and block any possible return to office in the future .
And , above all to debilitate the mass resistance movement .
The two presidents met again at the G - 8 summit in Italy .
U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton chose Arias , whose skills in serving imperialism won him a Nobel Peace prize , to host talks between the Zelaya government ( in - exile ) and the coup leaders .
He " mediated " in San José between representatives of " both sides . "
With the OAS pushed out of the picture , the talks moved away from the demand for the immediate and unconditional return of Zelaya , to a framework of conditional and delayed return ( and ipso facto , the conditioned and delayed retirement of the de facto regime ! ) .
The talks began as a means to delay Zelaya ’s return and to buy time for the coup regime , in the hope it could stabilize its rule within the country .
Zelaya accepted the Plan as a basis for discussion .
But talks soon collapsed , because the coup regime categorically rejected Zelaya ’s return as President .
A second attempt by Arias failed for the same reason .
Zelaya then turned away from the Arias exercise and began again to refocus on building the resistance and on diplomatic outreach .
His government in exile operates mainly on the Honduran - Nicaraguan border ( Ocotal ) , and at the Honduran embassy in Managua .
Impact of resistance
Mass opposition resurged , inspired by Zelaya ’s attempts to return via the Nicaraguan border , and by the effective work done by his wife ( Xiamara Castro de Zelaya ) within the country .
This had its effect .
Obama then came out with another more pointed reiteration of the U.S. stand that the coup regime had to accept Zelaya ’s return through the San José - Arias path .
Brazil and Mexico backed this stance , as did OAS General Secretary Insulza .
The coup regime has continued to defy this course .
On the heels of Obama 's statement , Jose Miguel Insulza , Oscar Arias , and Spanish vice - president Maria Teresa Fernandez de la Vega proposed sending an OAS ministerial - level delegation to Honduras to try to convince the military regime to accept Zelaya 's return , and perhaps try to extract more teeth from Zelaya .
Coup leader Micheletti says he would accept such a delegation only if no ministers from ALBA countries are included .
The mission will arrive on Aug 11 .
It is made up of foreign ministers of Argentina , Mexivo , Canada , Costa Rica , Jaimaica , and the Dominican Republic , accompanied by José Miguel Insulza of the OAS .
Meanwhile , Zelaya has agreed to major concessions .
He has accepted the principle of a national unity government , whose main task would be to stabilize the country , get the economy moving again , restore services such as education and health , and organize the November national elections .
In essence , Zelaya ’s team feels it has no choice but to accept returning as a debilitated and hand - tied regime with involvement of major figures of the coup .
The author's of the Arias Plan hope this would leave the ruling class and the army with significant leverage to politically defeat the mass movement and the Zelaya current in the coming elections .
That is not certain .
In a press conference in Mexico during his state visit this week , Zelaya sent a message to Washington and other hemispheric governments – either golpismo ( coup making ) by the extreme right will be contained , or Latin America ’s left - wing guerrillas will be reborn .
He again asserted the people ’s right and possibility of insurrection under conditions of military dictatorship .
To the grassroots
Anyone who leaves the mass movement out of their calculations may come up short .
The resistance movement has emerged as a new force , much more sophisticated and powerful than before June 28 .
Greater unity between mestizo , indigenous , and Afro-Honduran peoples augurs well .
Their international ties are more varied and stronger .
Activists have been through a great school of class struggle of the most acute nature and brutal form .
The Zelaya current itself is not the same as it was before the coup .
There is every possibility that the interim period , with or without Zelaya ’s return , can be used to mature and consolidate this movement and to build its capacity to take on the ruling class in the electoral process and the ongoing battle of for the hearts and minds of the great majority of the nation .
The next Day of Action is Aug 11 , when feeder marches from all over Honduras will converge on the industrial centre San Pedro Sula and the capital Tegucigalpa .
Hondura 's National Resistance Front has appealed for simultaneous solidarity protests around the world on that day .
The outcome depends , above all , on the capacities of the grassroots to remain on guard and active in political struggle .
Their activity will likely unfold under the twin banners of an election campaign and building support for convoking a Constituent Assembly .
Anti-imperialist fighters will do well to keep their focus on defending the mass movement and its leaders in Honduras , and the goal of continental unity of Our America against imperial domination .
The Honduran coup of June 28 was an imperial dress rehearsal , a harsh school for the coup instigators and for all of Latin America .
Above all , the coup is a school for the Honduran grassroots .
Hondurans , no matter the short term twists and turns among contending forces , will never be the same .

James Murdoch , the heir to his father Rupert 's global News Corporation empire , last night accused the BBC of undertaking a " chilling " land - grab of the media that posed a " serious and imminent " threat to the future provision of news in Britain .
Murdoch Jnr , who is News Corp 's chairman and chief executive for Europe and Asia , warned that the dominance of the BBC risked creating the type of news media which George Orwell described in the novel 1984 .
" As Orwell foretold , to let the state enjoy a near - monopoly of information is to guarantee manipulation and distortion , " he said .
Delivering the prestigious James MacTaggart Memorial Lecture at the Edinburgh Television Festival , he railed against the " authoritarianism " of the Government and its watchdog Ofcom .
He criticised rules designed to uphold impartiality in broadcast news and advocated the system of self - regulation which applied to the press .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The speech , which shocked the television executives , echoed the sentiments of his father , who delivered an outspoken attack on broadcasting establishment in the same venue two decades earlier .
Whereas Murdoch Snr's MacTaggart Lecture of 1989 had predicted the digital future , James Murdoch talked of the " digital present " and compared the media industry 's conservatives to the creationists who rejected Charles Darwin 's theory of evolution .
In powerful language , he remonstrated against the growth of the BBC 's news provision on the internet .
" Dumping free , state - sponsored news on the market makes it incredibly difficult for journalism to flourish on the internet , " he said .
" We seem to have decided as a society to let independence and plurality wither .
To let the BBC throttle the news market and then get bigger to compensate . "
The criticisms reflected his father 's comments earlier this month that News Corp 's newspapers must begin charging for their online content , a strategy undermined by the BBC website 's presence as a vast source of free news .
" It is essential for the future of independent digital journalism that a fair price can be charged for news , " James Murdoch said last night .
He claimed that " the threat to independent news provision is serious and imminent " .
The corporation 's governing body , The BBC Trust , had an " abysmal record " in overseeing the organisation 's activities , he said , citing examples of the BBC 's expansionism .
" The scale and scope of its [ the BBC's ] current activities and future ambitions is chilling .
Being funded by a universal hypothecated tax , the BBC feels empowered and obliged to try to offer something for everyone , even in areas well served by the market . "
The growth of BBC Radio 2 , he said , had damaged the radio industry by taking listeners already well - served by the commercial sector .
" Performers like Jonathan Ross were recruited on salaries no commercial competitor could afford , and audiences for Radio 2 have grown steadily as a result , " he said .
" No doubt the BBC celebrates the fact that it now has well over half of all radio listening .
But the consequent impoverishment of the once - successful commercial sector is testament to the corporation 's inability to distinguish between what is good for it and what is good for the country . "
Broadcasting , Murdoch complained , was constrained by an " authoritarian " degree of intervention by Ofcom .
He compared British media regulation unfavourably with systems in Germany , India and France .
" The problem with the UK is that it is unhappy in every way : it is the Addams Family of world media . "

He contrasted the regulation in broadcasting with the self - regulation of the press , praising British newspapers for being " fearless and independent " and suggesting that the aim of achieving impartiality in broadcast news by balancing opinions was unattainable .
" The mere selection of stories and their place in the running order is itself a process full of unacknowledged partiality . "
Murdoch , 36 , is non-executive chairman of BSkyB , whose Sky News service is subject to tight controls on impartiality , unlike the unashamedly right - wing American channel Fox News , also part of the News Corp portfolio .
Twenty years ago , Rupert Murdoch 's MacTaggart Lecture was characterised by his claim that television was a business and should not be the preserve of a publicly - supported duopoly of the BBC and ITV .
Yesterday his son , ended his own speech with a similar homage to capitalism in the media .
" There is an inescapable conclusion that we must reach if we are to have a better society , " he said .
" The only reliable , durable , and perpetual guarantor of independence is profit . "
What Rupert said – and did it come true ?
By Chris Green
" The arguments which have recently dominated British broadcasting , such as multi-channel choice versus public service duopoly , will soon sound as if they belong to the Stone Age . "
Murdoch saw television as a business and believed it could only thrive in a competitive environment – he was right in predicting that the duopoly of the BBC and ITV would not last .
" [ TVs will be ] linked by fibre optic cable to a global cornucopia of programming and nearly infinite libraries of data , education and entertainment .
All with full interactivity . "
Very accurate .
He predicted the birth of " on- demand " television – something which has only emerged recently – made fully interactive by the internet .
The BBC will find it hard to justify the " compulsory poll tax that finances it " in " the multi- channel world of the mid-1990s " .
Only partially correct .
Although the licence fee is far from popular , it still survives and has increased in price .
" Is it really healthy for British society to be served up a diet of television which constantly looks backward ? "
This debate still continues .
Many argue that broadcasters do not show enough innovation , and are incensed by the number of repeats shown .
It 's the news that fans of the original Alien film have longed to hear – Variety reports that Ridley Scott is to return to the franchise he launched in 1979 , taking the director 's chair for a prequel .
Twentieth Century Fox 's announcement is unfortunate news for Carl Rinsch , a TV adverts director who was Scott 's original choice to take the reins on the new film .
Some reports had suggested Fox was unhappy with the idea of an untried film - maker resurrecting the slasher - in - space series , and wanted Scott to step up from his original role as producer .
It now looks like Fox has got its man .
The new film will be set before the events of Scott 's 1979 film , in which the crew of a commercial towing ship respond to a distress signal from the empty ship , only to discover too late that the signal was meant to warn them .
The prequel will be Scott 's first science fiction project since Blade Runner in 1982 and will be based on a script by Jon Spaihts , who seems to be Hollywood 's sci- fi writer of the moment .
Apart from the Alien prequel , Spaihts is also working on Shadow 19 , which has Keanu Reeves attached ; Reeves in turn has hired him to write " space journey epic " Passengers .
Spaihts is also reportedly scripting Children of Mars for Disney .
Scott , 71 , is currently filming Robin Hood , which appears to have dropped its original name , Nottingham – it stars Russell Crowe as the outlaw , with Cate Blanchett as Maid Marian .
There have been four films in the Alien series , plus two spin - off Aliens vs Predator films , which brought Scott 's xenomorphs together with the extraterrestrial hunters spawned by John McTiernan in 1987 .
The prequel looks like it will be the first Alien film proper not to feature the iconic figure of Ellen Ripley , played by Sigourney Weaver .

In his book , “ The Depression Cure : The 6 - Step Program to Beat Depression without Drugs , ” author Stephen Ilardi argues that the rate of depression among Americans is roughly ten times higher today than it was just two generations ago , and he points the blame to our modern life - style .
Everything is so much easier today than it was back when we had to hunt and gather .
Why does n’t the convenience translate into happiness ?
His book concentrates on six ways we ’ve turned our back on the things that fight depression .
I concur with him that the modern lifestyles contributes to the rise of depression , and I wholeheartedly support all six steps he offers .
In fact , each one is included in my 12 - step program for beating depression .
However , I am uncomfortable with his dismissal of medication , because that is such an important part of my program .
He agrees that for those battling severe depression , antidepressants are effective , and claims that individuals suffering from bipolar disorder derive unequivocal benefit from mood stabilizers .
But he thinks that the majority of those suffering from unipolar depression can get better on their own .
I guess I ’m a tad skeptical because I tried that route .
Even though I had implemented all six of his steps into my recovery program , I did n’t get well until I found the right medication combination –which included two antidepressants in addition to a mood stabilizer –to treat my bipolar disorder ; that is , until I was stable enough to continue all the exercises needed to get and stay well .
And the mood stabilizer by itself was not enough to bring me out of a suicidal depression .
I want to highlight his six steps , however , because I do think they are crucial to a recovery program from depression , and I congratulate him on such a comprehensive book .
1. Omega -3 Fatty Acids
Yes .
Absolutely .
I get a Noah ’s Ark shipment of those to my house every month , as I have read the same research .
Ilardi writes :
Because the brain needs a steady supply of omega - 3s to function properly , people who do n’t eat enough of these fats are at increased risk for many forms of mental illness , including depression .
Across the globe , countries with the highest level of omega - 3 consumption typically have the lowest rates of depression .
Clinical researchers have even started using omega - 3 supplements to treat depression , and the results so far have been highly encouraging .
For example , British researchers recently studied a group of depressed patients who had failed to recover after taking antidepressant medication for eight weeks .
All study patients stayed on their meds as prescribed , but some also took an omega - 3 supplement .
About 70 percent of those who received the supplement went on to recover , compared with only 25 percent of patients who kept taking only the medication .
This study–along with a handful of others like it–suggests that omega - 3s may be among the most effective antidepressant substances ever discovered .
2. Engaged Activity
According to Ilardi , engaged activity keeps us from ruminating , and ruminating causes depression .
I understand his logic , and he is right that we are more isolated now in our lifestyle than even 10 years ago because technology allows us to do our jobs individually .
Says Ilardi :
The biggest risk factor for rumination is simply spending time alone , something Americans now do all the time .
When you ’re interacting with another person , your mind just does n’t have a chance to dwell on repetitive negative thoughts .
But , really , any sort of engaged activity can work to interrupt rumination .
It can even be something simple .
3. Physical Exercise
You all know where I stand on exercise : it ’s essential .
At least for this brain .
I ca n’t go two or three days without feeling the effect of no exercise .
I ’ve cited much of the same research as Ilardi in past posts .
But here ’s a reminder .
Ilardi writes :
Researchers have compared aerobic exercise and Zoloft head to head in the treatment of depression .
Even at a low “ dose ” of exercise–thirty minutes of brisk walking three times a week–patients who worked out did just as well as those who took the medication .
Strikingly , though , the patients on Zoloft were about three times more likely than exercisers to become depressed again over a ten - month follow - up period .
There are now over a hundred published studies documenting the antidepressant effects of exercise .
Activities as varied as walking , biking , jogging , and weight lifting have all been found to be effective .
It ’s also becoming clear just how they work .
Exercise changes the brain .
It increases the activity level of important brain chemicals such as dopamine and serotonin ( the same neurochemical targeted by popular drugs like Zoloft , Prozac , and Lexapro ) .
Exercise also increases the brain ’s production of a key growth hormone called BDNF .
Because levels of this hormone plummet in depression , some parts of the brain start to shrink over time , and learning and memory are impaired .
But exercise reverses this trend , protecting the brain in a way nothing else can .
4. Sunlight Exposure
Says Ilardi :
A deeper link exists between light exposure and depression–one involving the body ’s internal clock .
The brain gauges the amount of light you get each day , and it uses that information to reset your body clock .
Without light exposure , the body clock eventually gets out of sync , and when that happens , it throws off important circadian rhythms that regulate energy , sleep , appetite , and hormone levels .
The disruption of these important biological rhythms can , in turn , trigger clinical depression .
Because natural sunlight is so much brighter than indoor lighting –over a hundred times brighter , on average–a half hour of sunlight is enough to reset your body clock .
Even the natural light of a gray , cloudy day is several times brighter than the inside of most people ’s houses , and a few hours of exposure provide just enough light to keep circadian rhythms well regulated .
5. Social Support
I ca n’t count the number of studies I ’ve read indicating the importance of social support .
Recently Rick Nauert posted the results of a recent University of Michigan study on how gossip does us good .
University of Michigan researcher and lead author of the study , Stephanie Brown , said : “ Many of the hormones involved in bonding and helping behavior lead to reductions in stress and anxiety in both humans and other animals .
Now we see that higher levels of progesterone may be part of the underlying physiological basis for these effects . ”
Ilardi writes :
The research on this issue is clear :
When it comes to depression , relationships matter .
People who lack a supportive social network face an increased risk of becoming depressed , and of remaining depressed once an episode strikes .
Fortunately , we can do a great deal to improve the quality and depth of our connections with other and this can have a huge payoff in terms of fighting depression and reducing the risk of recurrence .
6. Sleep
Again , amen !
Per Ilardi :
When sleep deprivation continues for days or weeks at a time , it can interfere with our ability to think clearly .
It can even bring about serious health consequences .
Disrupted sleep is one of the most potent triggers of depression , and there ’s evidence that most episodes of mood disorder are preceded by at least several weeks of subpar slumber .

Wolfgang Bengel , the technical director at German biomass company BMP Biomasse Projekt , saw a business opportunity in solving the breweries ’ grain waste headache .
He reasoned that the leftover grain could be used to create steam and biogas , which would provide energy for the breweries , cheapening their energy costs as well as their costs of transporting grain to farms .
Bengel has successfully treated the residue from rice and sugar cane in boilers with atmospheric fluidized bed combustion systems , to produce energy in China and Thailand , and Bengel thought a similar process could be developed for the breweries ’ spent wet grain .
Water would first have to be removed from the wet spent grain , the grain would have to be dried and then burned to produce energy .
“ Beer making is energy intensive – you boil stuff , use hot water and steam and then use electric energy for cooling – so if you recover more than 50 percent of your own energy costs from the spent grain that ’s a big saving , ” says Bengel .
BMP turned to a long - standing business partner , fellow German biogas plant specialist INNOVAS , which had worked with it in China , to help develop the method as a EUREKA project .
Germany ’s BISANZ , which works on engineering projects , was also enlisted , as was Slovakian partner Adato , which designs boilers .
By chance , BISANZ had been working on a boiler plant for a waste management company which entered bankruptcy , with assets being sold .
The partners decided to buy the unwanted plant and to adapt the equipment to the process of burning spent grain .
Researchers had to add extra cleaning and filtering equipment to the combustion equipment they had bought .
There are extremely high European standards for combustion and the team had to extend the research timetable as its initial burning tests failed to meet the requirements .
“ We had more than 50 - 60 test periods of burning mixtures of spent grain , ” says Bengel .
They have managed to refine the process so that the burning met the requirements .
They also perfected a process for the anaerobic treatment of the waste water from breweries , thereby producing a complete system for breweries to treat their complete waste stream , wet spent grain and waste water .
One of Germany ’s environmental protection agencies ( TÜV ) certified the burning process as up to standard .
Breweries who sign up could become greener breweries , creating their own energy and cutting down on lorries travelling to and from their factories .
“ Out of 100,000 tonnes of wet spent grain , you have 2,000 tonnes or even less of ashes , ” says Bengel .

Wang was making progress , again .
He was beating Roy Halladay in the sixth inning , and with another out , he could call Saturday ’s game his longest outing of a difficult season .
But his shoulder would not let him .
Wang allowed a home run , then threw a ball that was startlingly slower than it should have been .
He left Yankee Stadium for a hospital , slipped into a magnetic resonance imaging tube and returned before the game ended .
He watched from the clubhouse as Jorge Posada singled home the winning run in the 12th inning of the Yankees ’ 6 - 5 victory over the Toronto Blue Jays .
The Yankees have won 9 of 10 and moved to a game behind Boston for first place in the American League East .
Posada ducked a decoy pie in the face from Joba Chamberlain after the game , only to be slammed by A. J. Burnett .
Yet the loss of a starter , even one like Wang who has struggled to find his inner ace , tempered the fun .
The Yankees said Wang had a shoulder strain and bursitis , and Manager Joe Girardi acknowledged he would need rest .
That almost certainly means another trip to the disabled list for Wang , who missed most of last season with a foot injury , the effects of which bled into this season .
An organization 's data is often its most valuable asset , but today 's file systems provide few facilities to ensure its safety .
Databases , on the other hand , have long provided transactions .
Transactions are useful because they provide atomicity , consistency , isolation , and durability ( ACID ) .
Many applications could make use of these semantics , but databases have a wide variety of nonstandard interfaces .
For example , applications like mail servers currently perform elaborate error handling to ensure atomicity and consistency , because it is easier than using a DBMS .
A transaction - oriented programming model eliminates complex error - handling code because failed operations can simply be aborted without side effects .
We have designed a file system that exports ACID transactions to user - level applications , while preserving the ubiquitous and convenient POSIX interface .
In our prototype ACID file system , called Amino , updated applications can protect arbitrary sequences of system calls within a transaction .
Unmodified applications operate without any changes , but each system call is transaction protected .
We also built a recoverable memory library with support for nested transactions to allow applications to keep their in - memory data structures consistent with the file system .
Our performance evaluation shows that ACID semantics can be added to applications with acceptable overheads .
When Amino adds atomicity , consistency , and isolation functionality to an application , it performs close to Ext3 .
Amino achieves durability up to 46 % faster than Ext3 , thanks to improved locality .
Once again , the Republicans , this time led by Utah Senator Orrin Hatch , are misleading the public in an attempt to deny millions of people basic preventive health care coverage .
This article was updated with links at 11:22 am , Monday , July 13th , 2009 .
The Republican Party , apparently bereft of viable ideas on how to solve pressing issues , is living up to its reputation as a one - trick pony : launching misleading attacks either on economic policies or on health policies , in the latter case consistently throwing around the word " abortion " whenever and whereever women ’s health services are involved .
The most recent exercise in the party ’s " do n’t - let - the - facts - get - in - the - way " effort to obstruct progress on virtually any issue under consideration by Congress is an attack by Senator Orrin Hatch ( R - UT ) on a provision of a health reform bill –the Affordable Health Choices Act–known as the Women ’s Health Amendment .
Hatch is leading the charge falsely claiming that this amendment includes coverage for abortion services .
It does not .

The amendment , which would increase access to urgently needed preventive health care in low - income , medically - underserved communities , was introduced last week by Senator Barbara Mikulski ( D - MD ) as the Senate HELP Committee ( Health , Education , Labor and Pensions ) considered amendments to the Act .
It was supported by a wide range of groups , including , among others , Families USA , the Service Employees International Union ( SEIU ) , Campaign for America ’s Future , Health Care for America Now , the American Nurses Association , the American Academy of Nursing , the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists , National Women ’s Law Center , and the National Partnership for Women and Families .
Yet despite the fact that the United States is facing an unprecedented shortage of health care providers , that more than 40 million Americans lack access to health care , and that low - income , medically underserved communities are hardest hit by the concurrent crises we are now facing , Republicans sought to block the amendment .
It passed .
Only one Democrat , Senator Bob Casey ( D - PA ) , voted against the amendment .
( As of the morning of July 13th , 2009 , Senator Casey ’s office has not yet returned calls inquiring about the reasons for his vote ) .
Efforts by Hatch and others to remove the amendment were strongly opposed by advocates for gay , lesbian , and transgender communities , for HIV and AIDS prevention and treatment , and for women ’s health .
The Human Rights Campaign , which supports the rights of gay , lesbian , bisexual and transgender persons , favors the amendment because :
Many HIV / AIDS service providers and health facilities that focus on LGBT people are [ essential community providers ] and serve as the primary source of health care for these individuals .
The National Minority AIDS Council ( NMAC ) pointed to the critical need for expanded access to the kinds of services offered by the Mikulski Amendment in a statement on its website :
Preventative care is particularly important for women of color .
Often the primary care takers of their families , they tend to put the needs of their family members and children ahead of their own – to the detriment of their health .
Since 1992 , HIV rates among women of color have risen nearly 10 % , with over 80 % of all HIV cases among women in this country occurring among Black and Hispanic women .
Undaunted by this first loss , Committee Republicans apparently see an opportunity to complicate the health reform process by using abortion as a wedge issue and perhaps try to poison the well in the next round of votes on this bill by spreading misinformation .
Again , the amendment does not include coverage for abortion care .
The amendment states :
A group health plan and health insurance issuer offering group or individual health insurance coverage shall provide coverage for , and shall not impose any cost sharing requirements ( other than minimal cost sharing in accordance with guidelines developed by the Secretary ) for , with respect to women ( including pregnant women and individual of child - bearing age ) , such additional preventive care and screenings not covered under section 2708 as provided for in guidelines supported by the Health Resources and Services Administration .
It would :
include within health insurance plan networks those essential community providers , where available , that serve predominantly low - income , medically - under - served individuals , such as health care providers defined in section 340B ( a ) ( 4 ) of the Public Health Service Act and [ in the relevant section of the ] Social Security Act .
Expanding coverage to these populations is an urgent matter of public health .
First , women have higher health care costs than men to begin with .
Women of childbearing age spend 68 percent more in out - of - pocket health care costs than men , in part because of reproductive health - related needs .
Yet the economic downturn , loss of jobs and health insurance and expansion of the numbers of people living in poverty have led a growing number of women to forego preventive health care .
Recent research shows that women are increasingly delaying or skipping preventive health care due the inability to pay for these services , thereby raising overall health costs in the long - run when treatment is required for originally preventable illness an disease .
A May 2009 report by the Commonwealth Foundation , for example , found that more than half of women surveyed delayed or avoided preventive care because of its cost .
The Women ’s Health Amendment seeks to address these gaps , something to which the Republican Party apparently objects .
What would the Women ’s Health Amendment actually do that is so scary ?
It would :
Increase access to basic primary preventive care .
This includes cancer screenings , well - women exams , pre-natal care , pap tests and other preventive care , including contraception and STI treatment and testing not covered in the prevention section of the Affordable Health Choices Act .
This includes cancer screenings , well - women exams , pre-natal care , pap tests and other preventive care , including contraception and STI treatment and testing not covered in the prevention section of the Affordable Health Choices Act.
Support " essential community providers ( ESPs ) . "
ESPs expand access to medically under - served communities in part by relieving provider shortages .
By requiring that health plans include ESPs " in-network , " the amendment would ensure patients ’ access to the health care providers that are located in and have built trust in their communities .
Coverage would include migrant health centers ; clinics providing HIV and AIDS prevention , treatment , and care ; women ’s health centers receiving grants under Title X ; public hospitals and other hospitals serving low - income communities ; and urban Indian organizations .
As NMAC noted , for example :
[ The ] Women ’s Health Amendment would cover women of color ’s access to services from minority faith - and community - based organizations ( MF / CBOs ) , which provide culturally competent and easily accessible health and HIV / AIDS services in communities of color throughout the country .
Over 4,000 strong , MF / CBOs have saved countless lives by providing their clients easily accessible health care services .
So what is the concern ?
Because Planned Parenthood health centers are considered essential health providers , and because these providers would be supported by this amendment , Republicans are claiming that the amendment mandates abortion coverage .
Again :
It does not .
It does however increase access to primary preventive health care , which constitutes more than 90 % of the services provided by Planned Parenthood centers — basic prevention and primary care .
A recent study by the Guttmacher Institute found that more than six in 10 patients who receive care at a women ’s health center like Planned Parenthood consider it their primary source of health care .
As we reported a few weeks ago , rates of cervical and breast cancer , sexually transmitted infections , and unintended pregnancies , among other health concerns , are highest in communities with the lowest access to essential reproductive and sexual health care .
Providing these services makes sense , whether you are considering this issue from the vantage point of public health , human rights , community well - being , health disparities , or financial savings to the country writ large .
It also increases access to basic contraceptive services which , by reducing unintended pregnancies , reduces the need for and by extension the number of abortions .
The very fact that the amendment does not fund abortion care , but reduces the need for abortion belies the Republicans real motives for opposing coverage for preventive care and essential service providers .
So Senator Hatch , and his comrades in the Senate and the anti-choice ocommunity ( such as the Family Research Council ) continue to attack health care reform by claiming that an amendment that will help ensure patients access to those health care providers they use and trust mandates abortion coverage .
Once again :
It does not .
The Republicans , using fear as a motivator , continue to mislead on essential health debates , at the cost of the health and lives of millions of Americans .
As time goes on , it is increasingly clear that these tactics are used as a foil for denying millions of Americans , primarily women and children , the most basic of health care services .
In fact , the majority of people have turned on the lights , opened the closet door , looked under the bed and realized that neither women ’s health issues writ large , nor Planned Parenthood specifically are the bogeymen they have been made out to be by a political party otherwise without a cause .
As demonstrated by the votes of all but one Democrat on the HELP Committee in favor of keeping this amendment , the majority of Americans have left this bogeyman behind .
In the interest of public health and fiscal responsibilty alone , the Republicans should do the same .

Eli Lilly and Company is a global pharmaceutical company and one of the world 's largest corporations .
Eli Lilly 's global headquarters is located in Indianapolis , Indiana , in the United States .
The company was founded in 1876 by a pharmaceutical chemist , Eli Lilly , for which the company was ultimately named .
Eli Lilly and Company is one of the United States ' oldest and leading pharmaceutical companies but has been involved in numerous controversies , including political controversies and medical ethics controversies .
edit ] Medical ethics
While bringing many good pharmaceuticals to market , Eli Lilly has sometimes been accused of pushing products to the marketplace with bad research , withholding of research to the public or false advertising .
Lilly was cited in lawsuits filed against the manufacturers of diethylstilbestrol ( DES ) , a drug prescribed to women in the 1940s and 1950s to prevent miscarriages .
The company was ordered to pay $ 400,000 in damages from DES even though the complications that developed were not known at the time .
Oraflex , the American version of Benoxaprofen , was withdrawn from the market in 1982 , just one month after gaining FDA approval .
A British medical journal found five cases of death due to jaundice in patients taking the drug and the FDA accused Lilly of suppressing unfavorable research findings .
In 1985 , the U.S. Justice Department filed criminal charges against the company and Dr. William Ian H. Shedden .
Lilly pleaded guilty to 25 criminal counts and paid a $ 25,000 fine .
edit ] Zyprexa
According to a New York Times article published on December 17 , 2006 , [1 ] Eli Lilly has engaged in a decade - long effort to play down the health risks of Zyprexa , its best - selling medication for schizophrenia , according to hundreds of internal Lilly documents and e-mail messages among top company managers .
These documents and e-mail messages were soon made publicly available as a location hidden Tor service , [ 2 ] and then made available on the public Internet .
Eli Lilly sought and obtained a " Temporary Restraining Order " from a U.S. District Court on January 4 , 2007 to stop the dissemination or downloading of Eli Lilly documents about Zyprexa , and this allowed them to get a few U.S. - based websites to remove them .
The documents can now only be downloaded from public Internet sites outside the U.S. [ 3 ]
These health risks include an increased risk for diabetes through Zyprexa 's links to obesity and its tendency to raise blood sugar .
Zyprexa is Lilly ’s top - selling drug , with sales of $ 4.2 billion last year .
The documents , given to the New York Times by a lawyer representing mentally ill patients , show that Lilly executives kept important information from doctors about Zyprexa ’s links to obesity and its tendency to raise blood sugar , two known risk factors for diabetes .
Lilly ’s own published data , which it told its sales representatives to play down in conversations with physicians , has shown that 30 percent of patients taking Zyprexa gain 22 pounds or more after a year on the drug , and some patients have reported gaining 100 pounds or more .
But Lilly was concerned that Zyprexa ’s sales would be hurt if the company was more forthright about the fact that the drug might cause unmanageable weight gain or diabetes , according to the documents , which cover the period 1995 to 2004 .
In 2006 , Lilly paid $ 700 million to settle 8,000 lawsuits from people who said they had developed diabetes or other diseases after taking Zyprexa .
But thousands of additional lawsuits are still pending . [ 4 ]
Lilly also instructed its sales representatives to suggest that physicians prescribe Zyprexa to older patients with symptoms of dementia .
One document states " dementia should be first message " for primary care doctors , since they " do not treat bipolar " or schizophrenia , but " do treat dementia . "
Three months after its launch , Lilly 's Zyprexa campaign , called ' Viva Zyprexa ' , led to 49,000 new prescriptions .
In 2002 , the company changed the name of the primary care campaign to ' Zyprexa Limitless ' and began to focus on people with mild bipolar disorder who had previously been diagnosed as depressed , despite the fact that Zyprexa has been approved only for the treatment of mania in bipolar disorder , not depression . [ 5 ]
In 2002 , British and Japanese regulatory agencies warned that Zyprexa may be linked to diabetes .
But even after the FDA issued a similar warning in 2003 , Lilly did not publicly disclose their own findings .
Eli Lilly agreed on January 4 , 2007 to pay up to $ 500 million to settle 18,000 lawsuits from people who claimed they developed diabetes or other diseases after taking Zyprexa .
Including earlier settlements over Zyprexa , Lilly has now agreed to pay at least $ 1.2 billion to 28,500 people who claim they were injured by the drug .
At least 1,200 suits are still pending , the company said .
About 20 million people worldwide have taken Zyprexa since its introduction in 1996 . [ 6 ]
In order to make up for shrinking sales figures for Zyprexa in the U.S.A. the company increased the prices for this medication in Germany in May 2007 by 18 percent . [ 7 ] [ 8 ]
Zyprexa was also the focus of the February 5 , 2009 article by Ben Wallace - Wells in Rolling Stone magazine titled Bitter Pill .
The article outlines the creation , marketing , and subsequent legal and ethical issues brought forth by Lilly 's actions to quickly put out a new anti-psychotic drug as the patent for Prozac neared expiration . [ 9 ]
edit ] Prozac
edit ] Legal
In one of the only three cases to ever go to trial for Prozac 's possible role in inducing suicide , Eli Lilly was caught corrupting the judicial process by making a deal with the plaintiff 's attorney to throw the case , in part by not disclosing damaging evidence to the jury .
The case , known as the Fentress Case involved a Kentucky man , Joseph Wesbecker , who was on Prozac and went to his workplace opening fire with an assault rifle killing eight people ( including Fentress ) , and injuring 12 others before killing himself .
The jury returned a 9 - to - 3 verdict in favor of Lilly .
But the judge , in the end , referred the matter to the Kentucky Supreme Court , which later found that " there was a serious lack of candor with the trial court and there may have been deception , bad faith conduct , abuse of judicial process and , perhaps even fraud . "
The judge later revoked the verdict and instead , recorded the case as settled .
The value of the secret settlement deal has never been disclosed , but was reportedly " tremendous " .
[ 10 ] ( See Standard Gravure shooting )
In 2001 Eli Lilly and Company ( Lilly ) agreed to settle Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) charges regarding the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive personal information collected from consumers through its Prozac.com Web site .[ citation needed ]
The company disclosed E-mail addresses of 669 Subscribers to its Prozac Reminder Service .
On June 27 , 2001 , a Lilly employee created a new computer program to access Medi- messenger subscribers ' e-mail addresses and sent them an e-mail message announcing the termination of the Medi-messenger service .
The June 27 e-mail message included all of the recipients ' e-mail addresses within the " To : " line of the message , thereby unintentionally disclosing to each individual subscriber the e-mail addresses of all 669 Medi- messenger subscribers .[ citation needed ]
As part of the settlement , Lilly said it would take appropriate security measures to protect consumers ' privacy .
Lilly 's security breach was the subject of a July 2001 petition from the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) requesting that the FTC investigate and take appropriate action to remedy the breach .[ citation needed ]
The company spent millions of dollars lobbying the United States Congress in hopes of extending its patent on Prozac .[ citation needed ]
The patent on Prozac was declared invalid on February 2 , 2001 , in connection with a lawsuit against a generic competitor .
The early loss of patent exclusivity allowed generic companies to sell Prozac and Lilly sales plummeted ; the corporation is still recovering from this major financial setback .[ citation needed ]
Eli Lilly subsequently released Prozac Weekly and Cymbalta .
The company has joined others in the drug industry in continuing to fight for extended patent laws that would protect their exclusive rights to market their pharmaceutical products .[ citation needed ]
The signs of violence and suicidality were there since Prozac was tested in premarketing trials .
In May 1984 , Germany ’s regulatory agency ( Bundesgesundheitsamt , BGA ) rejected Prozac as “ totally unsuitable for treating depression . ”
In July 1985 , Eli Lilly ’s own data analysis — from a pool of 1,427 patients — showed high incidence of adverse drug effects and evidence of drug - induced violence in some patients .
[ 11 ]
In May 1985 , FDA ’s ( then ) chief safety investigator , Dr. Richard Kapit , wrote : “ Unlike traditional tricyclic antidepressants fluoxetine ’s profile of adverse side effects more closely resembles that of a stimulant drug than one that causes sedation . ”
He warned : “ It is fluoxetine ’s particular profile of adverse side - effects which may perhaps , in the future give rise to the greatest clinical liabilities in the use of this medication to treat depression . ” [ 12 ]
Dr. Kapit ’s safety review described the clinical trial data from 46 trials with a total of 1,427 patients .
He noted under the section , “ Catastrophic and Serious Events , ” 52 cases of “ egregiously abnormal laboratory reports which were the reason for early termination , ” and “ additional adverse event reports not reported by the company [ which ] were revealed on microfiche . ”
Dr. Kapit reported : “ In most cases , these adverse events involved the onset of an unreported psychotic episode . ”
There were ten reports of psychotic episodes ; two reports of completed suicides ; 13 attempted suicides ; four seizures — including a healthy volunteer ; and four reports of movement disorders .
In 1985 Dr. Kapit recommended “ labeling warning [ for ] the physician that such signs and symptoms of depression may be exacerbated by this drug " .
No such warning was issued until 2004 .
On August 18 , 2004 , a study in the Journal of the American Medical Association ( JAMA ) showed Prozac and cognitive behavior therapy , in combination , to be the most effective treatment of depression in adolescents .
The research , conducted over three years at 12 medical centers , was funded and coordinated by the National Institute of Mental Health ( NIMH ) at a cost to US taxpayers of $ 17 million . [ 13 ]
A total of 439 adolescents aged 12 - 17 were given Prozac , Prozac plus cognitive behavior therapy ( CBT ) , placebo plus CBT , or placebo alone .
After 12 weeks , 71 % of those treated with Prozac and CBT showed improvement ( defined by the therapists and the subjects ' responses to questionnaires ) .
Improvement was reported by 60 % of those taking Prozac without CBT , 43 % getting CBT alone , and 35 % taking placebo alone .
NIMH Director Thomas Insel told the media it was a " landmark study " because " it 's the largest publicly funded study and the only study this size that does n't have pharmaceutical funding . "
However , of the 11 authors of the study , six received funding from Eli Lilly , including the lead author , John March . [ 14 ]
Data to which March et al did not draw attention [ opinion needs balancing ] showed a higher incidence of harmful behavior among teens taking Prozac ( 11.9 % ) compared to those on placebo ( 5.4 % ) and CBT alone ( 4.5 % ) .
Few stories mentioned that teenagers to whom suicidal thoughts had occurred had been excluded from the study before it began .[ opinion needs balancing ]
According to FDA documents posted on the FDA website on September 25 , 2003 , at least 2 of 48 children treated with Prozac in the NIMH - sponsored trial attempted suicide .[ citation needed ]
NIMH 's role in funding a study with taxpayer money was subsequently used by Eli Lilly as court evidence to extend its Prozac patent exclusivity and to obtain FDA approval for treating depression in children .[ citation needed ]
In 2005 an internal document purportedly from Eli Lilly , and originally published in the British Medical Journal ( BMJ ) showed that the drug maker had data more than 15 years old showing that patients on its antidepressant Prozac were far more likely to attempt suicide and show hostility than were patients on other antidepressants and that the company attempted to minimize public awareness of the side effects .[ citation needed ]
The 1988 document indicated that 3.7 percent of patients attempted suicide while on the blockbuster drug , a rate more than 12 times that cited for any of four other commonly used antidepressants .
The document , which cited clinical trials of 14,198 patients on fluoxetine also stated that 2.3 percent of users suffered psychotic depression while on the drug , more than double the next - highest rate of patients using another antidepressant .
The document was provided to CNN by the office of U.S. Representative Maurice Hinchey ( D - New York ) , who called for tightening FDA regulations on drug safety .
" The case demonstrates the need for Congress to mandate the complete disclosure of all clinical studies for FDA - approved drugs so that patients and their doctors , not the drug companies , decide whether the benefits of taking a certain medicine outweigh the risks , " Rep .
Hinchey said . [ 15 ]
The BMJ said the documents disappeared in 1994 , during the Fentress Case .
Each of the four pages of the paper obtained by CNN is stamped " Confidential " and " Fentress , " the name of one of Wesbecker 's victims . [ 16 ]
edit ] Evista
In 2005 Eli Lilly and Co. agreed to plead guilty to a federal misdemeanor and pay $ 36 million to settle charges that it illegally marketed and promoted its Evista osteoporosis drug for two unapproved uses .
The Department of Justice said an investigation that began in July 2002 found that some Lilly sales representatives promoted Evista in 1998 as useful for preventing and reducing the risk of breast cancer and for reducing the risk of heart disease .
The FDA had approved neither use .
edit ] Thiomersal
Thiomersal is a preservative that contains mercury and is used by Eli Lilly and others in vaccines .
In 1999 the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Public Health Service urged vaccine makers to stop using mercury - based preservatives .[ citation needed ]
In 2001 the Institute of Medicine concluded that the link between autism and thiomersal was “ biologically plausible . ” [ citation needed ]
However , the Institute of Medicine as well as the World Health Organization have subsequently concluded , on the grounds of extensive epidemiologic data , that there is no evidence that thiomersal in vaccines is harmful . [ 17 ] [ 18 ]
Nonetheless , by 2002 , thiomersal lawsuits against Eli Lilly were progressing through the courts .
Political analysts and the parents of autistic children were baffled when it was revealed , shortly after the passage of the Homeland Security Act in 2002 , that a rider to the bill had been added just prior to passage , that would shield Eli Lilly and the pharmaceutical industry from billions of dollars in anticipated lawsuits over vaccines . [ 19 ]
Known as the " Eli Lilly Protection Act " , [ 20 ] the provision was designed to force lawsuits over the preservative thiomersal , calling the suits into a special ' vaccine court ' .
The provision could have resulted in the dismissal of thousands of cases filed by parents , who contend mercury in thiomersal poisoned their children , causing autism and other neurological ailments , but the rider was subsequently repealed when the next session of Congress convened in 2003 .[ citation needed ]
edit ] Xigris
In 2001 , Eli Lilly 's chairman , president and CEO , Sidney Taurel , told shareholders : " No medicine better symbolizes our mission than Xigris , " calling it " one of our industry 's genuine breakthroughs . " [ 21 ]
Xigris was designed to fight sepsis , a condition that kills more than 200,000 Americans annually .
Xigris is the only approved drug for sepsis , and it costs $ 8,000 to treat a single patient .[ citation needed ]
Lilly hoped Xigris would be a blockbuster , with sales of at least a billion dollars a year .
But after five years on the market , sales are only $ 200 million .[ citation needed ]
Eli Lilly used the Belsito & Company public relations firm in a marketing campaign to promote Xigris .
A report in the New England Journal of Medicine ( NEJM ) accused Lilly of initiating false reports of a shortage of the drug to boost sales . [ 22 ]
Belsito and Company spread the word that the drug was being " rationed " and physicians were being ' systematically forced ' to decide who would live and who would die .
As part of this effort , Lilly provided a group of physicians and bioethicists with a $ 1.8 million grant to form the Values , Ethics , and Rationing in Critical Care ( VERICC )
Task Force , purportedly to address ethical issues raised by rationing of the drug in hospital intensive care units .
Finally , the Surviving Sepsis Campaign was established , in theory to raise awareness of severe sepsis and generate momentum toward the development of treatment guidelines .
Xigris has been linked to increased risk of serious bleeding in patients who use it as well as other concerns .
" Controversy surrounds both the drug study itself and the FDA approval , " wrote NEJM editor - at - large Richard P. Wenzel in 2002 . [ 23 ]
The FDA approved the drug despite the advisory committee 's split vote ( 10 to 10 ) due to concerns about the validity of the claimed efficacy and safety findings on the basis of a single trial .
Eli Lilly spokeswoman Judy Kay Moore insists that the company did not mastermind the ethics task force or steer the guideline - writing process . [ 24 ]

The two main findings - which were presented in the articles and theses - were that 200 people poisoned to death by DXP during the investigated period 1992 - 1999 .
Results nr two was that 956 ( 54 % ) of the 1782 deaths in the years 1992 - 1996 - with DXP in the blood - were assessed as poisoning .
Of the 956 deaths were judged 49 cases ( 5 % ) as emergency relief , in 542 cases ( 57 % ) as suicide and 365 cases ( 38 % ) as unclear fatality which dissect the doctors were not entirely clear on whether it was an accident or suicide .
In order to get the results outside the academic world published a popular book on DXP - research .

Preface in English : http://www.rmv.se/pdf/dxp-preface.pdf
Summary of the report : http://www.rmv.se/pdf/dxp-summary.pdf
On two occasions restrictions introduced in Sweden in which DXP would be prescribed .
The first time was in June 2001 , when the prescribing doctor had to use a special form , which must also be used when classified as narcotics medicines printed .
Distalgesic was banned in 2005 - that has been on the Swedish market for about 40 years - and Paraflex Comp was also removed from the market .
In the 1990s , there were seven different DXP - preparations , today left two on the Swedish market , both are so - called Dextropropoxifennapsylat and contains only substance DXP .
Nicotine preparations are Dexofen ( AstraZenca ) and Doloxene ( MEDA ) .
Sales have over the same period dropped by around 70 - 80 % and the number of fatal poisonings with about as much .
The English Agency MHRA decided on 31 January 2005 to " phase out the analgesic drug Co- Proxamol " - that is matched by , among other things , Darvon and Distalgesic - until the end of December 2007 .

edit ] Strattera and adult ADHD
In 2002 , Lilly began marketing Strattera , the first non-stimulant medication approved for the treatment of attention - deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) .
It was the first such medication to be specifically marketed to adults with this disorder .
Originally designed to be an antidepressant , but never received FDA approval for this use .
The drug instead was approved by the FDA for use in the treatment of adult ADHD , which has become its more common use .
Strattera has been used by more than two million patients .
In 2004 , Strattera grossed $ 632 million , or roughly 25 percent , of the $ 2.6 billion U.S. ADHD pharmaceutical market , and was the fastest growing medication in this market .
Lilly owns the domain www.adultadd.com[25] which allows visitors to take a test to see if they have the condition , and the company has run advertising campaigns , which have been designed to raise awareness of the condition .
This effort has been controversial because there are some medical professionals who believe that ADHD is overdiagnosed and that companies like Lilly have perpetuated this with extensive television and other marketing .
edit ] Acquisitions
edit ] Prosilac
In late 2008 , Eli Lilly bought over the rights to the controversial drug Prosilac , a recombinant form of bovine somatotropin fed to dairy cows to increase milk production . [ 26 ]
edit ] Icos
In October 2006 , Eli Lilly announced that it had reached terms to acquire Icos for $ 2.1 billion , or $ 32 a share . [ 27 ]
After receiving pressure from large institutional shareholders , as well as proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services ( ISS ) , Lilly increased its offer to $ 34 per share , a 6 percent increase . [ 28 ]
Resistance to the new offer was voiced again by some large shareholders , and ISS again advised shareholders against accepting the offer , which it deemed as insufficient . [ 29 ]
At a special meeting of shareholders , held on January 25 , 2007 , 77 percent of the shareholders voted in support of the acquisition . [ 30 ]
Closing of the transaction for Eli Lilly to acquire Icos for $ 2.3 billion occurred on January 29 , 2007 . [ 31 ]
As a result of the acquisition , Eli Lilly gained complete ownership of Cialis and promptly shut down Icos operations and employment of Icos personnel , except for 127 employees working at the biologics facility . [ 32 ] [ 33 ]
At the time of the acquisition , Icos was the largest biotechnology company in the Pacific Northwest , employing approximately 700 people . [ 34 ] [ 33 ]
In December 2007 , CMC Biopharmaceuticals A/S ( CMC ) , a Copenhagen , Denmark based provider of contract biomanufacturing services , bought the Bothell - based biologics facility and retained the existing 127 employees . [ 33 ]
In addition to the termination of Icos employees , other aspects of the acquisition were similarly legal but controversial , such the assertions that Icos was being sold too cheaply and that conflicts of interests existed . [ 35 ]
The latter related to Icos senior executives , who - despite poor stock performance in part from failed clinical development programs and an inability to successfully license drugs over the preceding years - advocated for and were to be massively compensated upon a successful acquisition . [ 27 ]
Senior executives at Icos received cash payments worth a combined $ 67.8 million for selling the company to Eli Lilly . [ 36 ]
Icos chairman , chief executive and president Paul Clark received a " golden parachute " worth $ 23.2 million in severance pay , cashed - out stock options , restricted stock awards and other bonuses for retention and closing the deal . [ 36 ]
Other management packages included Executive Vice President Gary Wilcox ( $ 8.5 million ) ; Chief Financial Officer Michael Stein ( $ 7.1 million ) ; Chief Medical Officer David Goodkin ( $ 5.9 million ) ; Thomas St. John , Vice President , Therapeutic Development ( $ 5.2 million ) ; Leonard Blum , Senior Vice President , Sales & Marketing ( $ 4.9 million ) ; John Kliewer , Vice President , General Counsel ( $ 4 million ) ; Michelle Yetman , Vice President , Human Resources ( $ 4 million ) ; Clifford Stocks , Vice President , Business Development ( $ 3.6 million ) , and Shing Chang , Senior Vice President , Drug Discovery ( $ 1.4 million ) . [ 36 ]
edit ] Political
Eli Lilly is also one of many drug companies that give soft money to advocacy groups and political action committees ( PACs ) to help influence lawmakers and regulators .
Historically Eli Lilly favors pro-business Republicans over Democrats with its political contributions ( 75 % to 25 % in the last nine US election cycles ) . [ 37 ]
Though the contributions of Lilly and similar large pharmaceutical companies typically are aimed at influencing policies and laws , it is difficult to argue that these contributions are aimed at approving specific new molecules .
[ who ? ]
Approval is handled via the FDA , not congress or any other lawmaker .
The FDA 's primary source of funding is " user fees " paid by the industry to ensure there are adequate resources available to review and approve these drugs .
Many have argued these user fees represent a conflict of interest . [ who ? ]
In 2000 - 2001 , the American Diabetes Association ( ADA ) did not disclose an unusual gift from Lilly : a lent executive , Emerson " Randy " Hall Jr. , who moved into ADA 's Alexandria , Virginia headquarters and coached the organization on growth strategies , all paid by Lilly.[ citation needed ]
A Philadelphia , Pennsylvania native now retired and living in Princeton , New Jersey , Hall said he never tried to influence the group and merely helped it market itself , including writing its slogan : " Cure . Care .
Commitment . "
Hall estimated that his work , including diabetes patient research he subsequently shared with Lilly , would have cost " hundreds of thousands " from a contractor .[ citation needed ]
Asked why it did not cite Hall on its tax returns or annual report , ADA spokeswoman Diane Tuncer said : " There is not a requirement to do so . " [ citation needed ]
Another non-profit group , the National Alliance on Mental Illness ( NAMI ) , did not disclose that Lilly marketing manager Gerald Radke briefly ran its entire operation .
Radke began in 1999 as a Lilly - paid " management consultant , " then left Lilly and served as NAMI 's paid " interim executive director " until mid-2001 .
The group acknowledged this only after being shown Radke 's resume listing the job .
After NAMI , he ran the Pennsylvania Office of Mental Health and Substance Abuse , and now serves in the Pennsylvania Health Department .
Lilly , which donated at least $ 2.5 million to the ADA and $ 3 million to NAMI between 2003 and 2005 , called its executive loans mutually beneficial .
" The primary goal is to assist that organization in developing a needed capacity or function , but it also often serves to assist in the career development of the employee , " a Lilly spokesman , Edward G. Sagebiel , said . [ 38 ]
In 2004 Charles Schalliol was made Director for the Indiana Office of Management and Budget .
Schalliol was Governor Mitch Daniels ' first appointment immediately following the 2004 election . [ 39 ] Daniels is also a former Eli Lilly executive and was the head of Office of Management and Budget for President George W. Bush before becoming Governor of Indiana .
Prior to joining Governor Daniels administration Schalliol held a variety of executive positions at Eli Lilly and Company , principally in strategic planning , investment banking and business development .
Schalliol led the purchase and sale of companies for Lilly including the formation of Guidant Corporation .
In 2005 , as part of a U.S. House of Representatives budget bill that reduces spending on Medicaid prescription drugs , Eli Lilly and other businesses secured a provision ensuring that their mental health drugs continue to fetch top price at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars to the states .[ citation needed ]
The provision , inserted by Rep. Steve Buyer ( R - Ind. ) , whose district flanks Lilly 's Indianapolis headquarters , would largely exempt antipsychotic and antidepressant medications from a larger measure designed to steer Medicaid patients to the least expensive treatment options .
To opponents , Buyer 's measure underscores the excessive power that corporate interests wield on Capitol Hill . [ who ? ]
Critics say the measure also violates the purpose of the budget - cutting bill , which was drafted to give state governments the flexibility to cut program costs in ways that minimize the harm done to beneficiaries .
[ who ? ]
The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the provision will raise federal drug spending by $ 125 million over five years , while state officials say they are likely to face far higher costs . [ 40 ]
In response to allegations about funding , Eli Lilly has stated it will now become the first major pharmaceutical company to voluntarily post online all information regarding educational grant funding and other contributions provided to US organizations . [ 41 ]
The gifts do not include the Lilly Foundation , which acts as a charitable organization separate from the company .
In February 2007 , the Serious Fraud Office in the UK launched an investigation into allegations of Eli Lilly being involved in the discredited oil - for - food sanctions regime in Iraq .
They are accused of paying bribes to Saddam Hussein 's regime . [ 42 ] [ 43 ]
edit ] Eli Lilly and the Bush Family
edit ] George H.W. Bush
After leaving the Central Intelligence Agency in 1977 , George H.W. Bush joined the board of directors of Eli Lilly for two years ( 1977 - 1979 ) .
Future Vice President to Bush Dan Quayle 's father , James C. Quayle , owned controlling interest in the The Indianapolis Star at that time .
Bush actively lobbied both within and without the Reagan Administration as Vice President in 1981 to permit drug companies to sell obsolete or especially domestically - banned substances to Third World countries .[ clarification needed ]
While Vice President , Bush continued to act on behalf of pharmaceutical companies by personally going to the Internal Revenue Service for special tax breaks for certain drug companies , including Lilly , who were manufacturing in Puerto Rico .
In 1982 , Bush intervened with the U.S. Department of Treasury in connection with proposed rules that would have forced pharmaceutical companies to pay significantly more taxes .
Bush was personally ordered to stop lobbying the IRS on behalf of the drug companies by the U.S. Supreme Court . [ 44 ]
Bush stopped lobbying , but pharmaceutical interests still received a 23 % additional tax break for their companies in Puerto Rico , who made these obsolete or banned American drugs for sale to Third World countries .
Lilly 's Puerto Rico - based affiliate now employs approximately 1,100 workers at three plants in Carolina and Mayagüez and 220 additional employees in its sales and marketing offices in San Juan .
edit ] George W. Bush
George W. Bush is the clear front runner when it comes to drug company contributions and patronage .
According to the Center for Responsive Politics ( CRP ) , manufacturers of drugs and health products had contributed $ 764,274 to the 2004 Bush campaign through their political action committees and employees by April 26 of the election year 2004 .

Appointees with Eli Lilly interests
President and CEO of Eli Lilly , Sidney Taurel , was named by U.S. President George W. Bush as a Homeland Security Advisory Council member in 2002 .
In 2003 Bush named Taurel a member of the President 's Export Council .
Bush named Taurel to the Advisory Committee for Trade Policy and Negotiations ( ACTPN ) in April 2007 for a four year term . [ 45 ]
Bush 's former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld has served on the boards of several companies including Eli Lilly partner Amylin Pharmaceuticals and Gilead Sciences .
Former Eli Lilly CEO Randall Tobias was named by Bush as Global AIDS Coordinator in 2003 .
Tobias later become the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development ( USAID ) , where he held the rank of Ambassador .
edit ] Medicare Prescription Drug , Improvement , and Modernization Act of 2003
White House Budget Director Mitch Daniels is a former Lilly executive and oversaw the Medicare Prescription Drug , Improvement , and Modernization Act of 2003 .
On January 25 , 2006 , Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi , Democratic Whip Steny H. Hoyer and Ranking Minority Member Henry A. Waxman asked J. Dennis Hastert , Speaker of the House of Representatives at that time , for a congressional investigation into the role played by the Alexander Strategy Group , a lobbying firm closely linked to Tom DeLay and Jack Abramoff , in the passage of the Medicare Prescription Drug Act which was passed on December 8 , 2003 .
With the indictments of DeLay and Abramoff , new questions arose about the role of the Alexander Strategy Group in the passing of the bill .
Lobby disclosure forms showed that the largest single client of the Alexander Strategy Group was the pharmaceutical industry , which paid the small firm over $ 2.5 million , including nearly $ 1 million in 2003 when the prescription drug law was being written .
The lobby disclosure forms also revealed that the primary clients represented by the Alexander Strategy Group were Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America ( PhRMA ) and Eli Lilly during consideration of the Medicare Prescription Drug Act .
The person representing PhRMA and Lilly was Tony Rudy , a former deputy chief of staff for DeLay who worked for Abramoff from 2001 to 2002 .
On January 9 , 2006 , the Alexander Strategy Group announced that it was shutting down its lobbying operations . [ 47 ]
Senior Vice President and General Counsel for Eli Lilly , Robert A. Armitage , is the past chair of the Patent Committee of PhRMA .
Eli Lilly President and CEO Sidney Taurel is a past president of the PhRMA .

Vaccine legislation protection
Early in 2002 , U.S. Senator Bill Frist tried to obtain protection for Eli Lilly from suits attached to legislation that would increase the availability of vaccines to average Americans , and regulate lawsuits against Eli Lilly involving thiomersal , but this attempt was thwarted by U.S. Senator Edward Kennedy , who opposed the measure .
Despite Kennedy 's effort , however , identical legal protections found their way into Homeland Security legislation .
After the bill passed , no one in Washington , D.C. was willing to take responsibility for having written or inserting the Lilly legal protections .
The rider was later annulled by Congress in 2003 .
Eli Lilly 's Political action committee ( PAC ) had given Frist almost $ 10,000 in campaign contributions in 2004 .
The White House denied any knowledge of the author / sponsor of the Lilly amendment .
Many argue this stretches belief , considering the ties the Bush administration has to the pharmaceutical giant .
edit ] President 's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief
The President 's Emergency Plan For AIDS Relief ( PEPFAR / Emergency Plan ) is President Bush 's pledge of $ 15 billion over five years ( 2003 –2008 ) to fight the HIV / AIDS pandemic .
On July 2 , 2003 , President George W. Bush selected former Eli Lilly chief executive Randall L. Tobias as the Global AIDS Coordinator for a $ 15 billion program to slow the spread of global AIDS and to treat it in Africa and the Caribbean .
Bush signed into law a measure to direct the money to 14 countries , most of them in Africa .
Tobias retired from Lilly in 1998 .
" This decision is another deeply disturbing sign that the president may not be prepared to fulfill his pledge to take emergency action on AIDS , " noted Paul Zeitz , executive director of the Global AIDS Alliance .
" It raises serious questions of conflict of interest and the priorities of the White House . " [ 48 ]
Several said they feared that Tobias would be " the fox in charge of the henhouse , " as Kate Krauss of the AIDS Policy Project put it .
Ambassador Mark Dybul replaced Tobias as U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator on October 10 , 2006 .
Bush 's AIDS project under Tobias has been called " extremely flawed " by critics . [ 49 ]
Tobias later become the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development ( USAID ) , where he held the rank of Ambassador .
Tobias , a proponent of abstinence as Global AIDS Coordinator , ironically resigned from USAID over a pay for sex scandal in April 2007 . [ 50 ]
edit ] New Freedom Initiative
A sweeping mental health initiative was unveiled by President George W. Bush in July 2004 .
The plan promises to integrate mentally ill patients fully into the community by providing " services in the community , rather than institutions , " according to a March 2004 progress report entitled New Freedom Initiative . [ 51 ] [ 52 ]
Bush established the New Freedom Commission on Mental Health in April 2002 to conduct a " comprehensive study of the United States mental health service delivery system . "
The commission issued its recommendations in July 2003 .
The President 's commission found that " despite their prevalence , mental disorders often go undiagnosed " and recommended comprehensive mental health screening for " consumers of all ages , " including pre-school children .
According to the commission : " Each year , young children are expelled from preschools and childcare facilities for severely disruptive behaviours and emotional disorders . "
Schools , wrote the commission , are in a " key position " to screen the 52 million students and 6 million adults who work at the schools .
The commission also recommended " Linkage [ of screening ] with treatment and supports " including " state - of - the - art treatments " using " specific medications for specific conditions . "
The commission commended the Texas Medication Algorithm Project ( TMAP ) , a similar program Bush started as Governor of Texas , as a " model " medication treatment plan that " illustrates an evidence - based practice that results in better consumer outcomes . "
The Texas project started in 1995 as an alliance of individuals from the pharmaceutical industry , the University of Texas , and the mental health and corrections systems of Texas .
The project was funded by a Robert Wood Johnson grant and by several drug companies .
Lilly 's Olanzapine ( trade name Zyprexa ) is one of the atypical antipsychotic drugs recommended as a first line drug in the Texas scheme .
A 2003 New York Times article reported that 70 % of Olanzapine sales are paid for by government programs , such as Medicare and Medicaid . [ 53 ]
All together Lilly reportedly contributed $ 103,000 to support TMAP .
Heather Lusk , an Eli Lilly representative , said contributions to TMAP were " educational " grants made by a company grants office .

Income and insurance data show that insured , working - poor families would be taxed 140 times more than Wall Street execs
CAMBRIDGE , Mass . -
As the debate over health care reform continues to unfold in town hall meetings and on Capitol Hill , a new study by two Harvard researchers has found that taxing job - based health benefits would heavily penalize insured , working families .
The study , titled " The regressivity of taxing employer - paid health insurance , " appears in the August 19 online edition of the New England Journal of Medicine .
It was written by Drs. David Himmelstein and Steffie Woolhandler , professors at Harvard Medical School and primary care doctors at Cambridge Hospital in Massachusetts .
The taxation of employer - sponsored health benefits has been advocated by many health economists and lawmakers , including some members of the influential Senate Finance Committee , which is now drafting health care reform legislation .
President Obama has said he has not ruled out such a tax to fund his reforms .
Analyzing income and insurance data from the 2005 Current Population Survey of the U.S. Census Bureau and other sources , the authors reveal that taxing workers ' job - based health insurance would cost those with low - incomes ( $ 0 - $ 10,000 annually ) 18.3 percent of their income , but cost high - income ( over $ 100,000 ) families a mere 2.7 percent .
( See the table from the study at http://healthcarereform .
nejm. org / ?p= 1521 )
The authors note that the tax rate would drop even lower for the super - rich .
" A Goldman Sachs executive who enjoyed the firm 's infamous $ 40,543 health plan got a federal tax subsidy of about $ 15,367 last year , " they write .
" But that 's only 0.13 percent of the bonuses received by the company 's four top earners .
So though taxing health benefits would spare the uninsured , the average poor family with employer - paid coverage would be taxed at a rate 140 times higher than Wall Street titans . "
Dr. David U. Himmelstein , lead author of the study and associate professor of medicine at Harvard , added : " Most economists and many politicians have claimed that taxing health benefits would hit the wealthy hardest , while sparing the poor .
But exactly the reverse is true .
For a poor , insured family a tax on their health benefits would take almost one - fifth of their total income . "
Dr. Steffie Woolhandler , co-author and professor of medicine at Harvard , said : " Instead of taxing benefits , politicians should embrace the only affordable option for universal coverage : a single - payer , Medicare - for - all program .
Single - payer would save $ 400 billion annually by simplifying administration , enough to assure quality care for everyone .
We cannot afford to keep wasteful private health insurers in business , and pay for it off the backs of working families . "
Himmelstein and Woolhandler are co-founders of Physicians for a National Health Program , an organization of 16,000 doctors and medical professionals who advocate for single - payer national health insurance .

ISLAMABAD ( Reuters ) - Pakistan is “ pretty certain ” Taliban chief Baitullah Mehsud , who has a $ 5 million U.S. bounty on his head , was killed with his wife and guards in a missile attack two days ago , the foreign minister said on Friday .
An intelligence officer in South Waziristan told Reuters that Mehsud ’s funeral had already taken place , while Pakistani media cited their own security sources , saying Mehsud was dead .
“ He was killed with his wife and he was buried in Nargosey , ” the officer said , referring to a tiny settlement about 1 km ( half a mile ) , from the site of the attack , believed to have been carried out by a pilotless U.S. drone aircraft .
Diplomats in Islamabad say Mehsud ’s death would mark a major coup for Pakistan , but many doubt it will help Western troops fighting the Taliban in Afghanistan .
Most of his focus has been on attacking Pakistan ’s government and security forces .
“ It is pretty certain now that he is dead .
Various government agencies have reported so , his own followers have said so , there are people who have been to the funeral and are witness to the burial , ” Pakistan ’s Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi told BBC radio on Friday .
“ It is a significant development .
He was the principal personality leading the Taliban movement in Pakistan .
“ With him gone , I think there is going to be an internal struggle and disarray in their ranks , I think it will set in demobilization .
It is a great success for the forces that are fighting extremism and terrorism in Pakistan , ” Qureshi said .
An official who requested anonymity went further .
“ It ’s 100 percent certain now , ” a senior member of the Pakistan government told Reuters , explaining that the intelligence services had obtained confirmation of Mehsud ’s death from family members .
But Pakistani officials say they lack physical evidence of Mehsud ’s death as it was impossible to enter the Taliban controlled area in the tribal lands of South Waziristan .
People were mourning in the settlement close to Makeen village , where Mehsud was tracked and targeted , Interior Minister Rehman Malik told Reuters .
He said intelligence suggested Taliban leaders were meeting somewhere in South Waziristan to decide on Mehsud ’s successor .
The missile attack killed Mehsud ’s brother and seven bodyguards as well as his wife , Malik added .
The wife ’s death had been confirmed hours after the attack on Wednesday that targeted her father ’s house .
A spokesman for the Afghan Taliban said their struggle would be unaffected by Mehsud ’s reported death .
“ The Taliban ’s jihad against foreign forces in Afghanistan will not be affected if a Pakistani Taliban leader is killed on the other side , ” Afghan Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said by telephone from an undisclosed location .
U.S. MISSILE ATTACKS
Taliban leaders presumed dead have sometimes resurfaced later and there were reports from other media quoting Taliban sources saying Mehsud was wounded and others saying he was dead .

If Mehsud was killed , regular Pakistani Taliban spokesmen were unlikely to confirm it until a new leader was chosen .
Qureshi said Mehsud would be hard to replace .
“ He had popularity which no other Taliban leader enjoys , he had quite a firm grip on various factions and there is no other personality who could replace him , ” Qureshi told the BBC .
Mehsud declared himself leader of the Pakistan Taliban , grouping around 13 factions in the northwest , in late 2007 and his fighters have staged a wave of suicide attacks inside Pakistan and on Western forces across the border in Afghanistan .
He is accused of being behind the assassination of Benazir Bhutto in December 2007 , a charge he has denied .
Conspiracy theories abound over who killed the former prime minister .
In the United States , White House spokesman Robert Gibbs told reporters Washington could not confirm Mehsud had been killed , but added : “ There seems to be a growing consensus among credible observers that he is indeed dead . ”
U.S. missile attacks on Mehsud territory in South Waziristan became more frequent after Pakistan ordered a military offensive against him in June .
Neither the Pakistani nor U.S. government confirms such attacks because of sensitivities over violation of Pakistan ’s territorial sovereignty .
The names that have surfaced as the most likely successors to Mehsud included Hakimullah Mehsud , Maulana Azmatullah and Wali-ur - Rehman , and Qari Hussein .
Hakimullah Mehsud commands Taliban militants in three tribal regions of Orakzai , Khyber and Kurram and is said to be an important leader in the Taliban hierarchy .
Like Baitullah , Azmatullah also hails from the Shahbikhel -- a sub-tribe of the Mehsuds .
He is an important commander and a member of the Taliban shura .
Wali - ur - Rehman is another shura member and a former spokesman for Baitullah .
Qari Hussain is regarded as the main overseer of the suicide bomb campaign and other high profile attacks inside Pakistan .
Hussain belongs to the Mehsud tribe but he is also a member of Lashkar - e - Jhangvi , a militant group based in the central province of Punjab that forged ties with al Qaeda well before the September 11 .

As a culture , we laud truth - tellers .
From an early age we 're taught to revere two of our most noteworthy presidents , Honest Abe and George Washington , who could not tell a lie .
What does it indicate , though , when the well - known story about the first US president coming clean after down his father 's cherry tree is nothing more than fiction , a bold - faced lie ?
Certainly , there are occasions where telling the truth , plain and simple , is the appropriate thing to do , such as when under oath .
But let 's be honest , lying , by embellishment or fabrication , is something we do as part of our everyday lives ; it 's part of being human .
By acknowledging our deceit , we may learn something about our nature .
Recent studies in have sought to understand what happens in our brains when we fib .
One of the most remarkable results is that we are finally developing reliable lie-detectors .
Although the polygraph has been a helpful tool , good liars are able to beat it .
Prevaricators often exhibit poor eye - contact , but sometimes a person is simply nervous .
Using fMRI to observe brain activity , scientists can detect lies with greater than 90 % accuracy .
The reason is that lying requires more brain power .
Pundits noted long ago that telling the truth is easier than lying because you do n't have to remember what you said to keep your story straight .
As it turns out , is a complicated mental task , and it requires greater brain activation than truthfulness in several key brain regions , such as the prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex .
While the prefrontal cortex , what is evolutionarily - speaking the most advanced region of the human brain , plays roles in , social conduct , and planning , the anterior cingulate cortex serves emotional functions and helps us empathize with others .
It 's no wonder that brain regions essential for , planning , short - term memory and social conduct are active when lying .
To mislead someone you have to anticipate how they 'll react to your story , you have to make the story plausible enough that they 'll believe it , and most importantly , you have to know the difference between when to be frank and when to B.S .
There are different categories of lies , such as bluffing or omitting the truth , and each requires its own unique patchwork of brain activity to pull the wool over someone 's eyes .
One brain region , however , remains consistently active during nearly all forms of lying .
The anterior prefrontal cortex , the frontal extremity of the brain directly above the eyes , seems to be the brain 's command center for lying .
Despite its unfailing activation during lies , until recently it was unclear if this region was busy suppressing the truth or if it served as a moral conflict monitor in the brain that lit up during deception .
Basically , if this brain region were missing , would we lie less because we were no longer able to conceal the truth , or more because we no longer found it immoral ?
As it turns out , it 's possible to find out what our brain would be like if part of it were missing .
A group of researchers in Germany 's University of Tuebingen recently tested the function of the anterior prefrontal cortex by temporarily disabling it using a method known as transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) .
tDCS works by sending a weak electrical current through the scalp to interfere with the activity of the brain cells below .
The effects are harmless and are used to moderately alter behavior and even as a treatment for .
To test the relationship between lying and the anterior prefrontal cortex , the researchers wanted to create a realistic scenario where subjects could lie or tell the truth at their own discretion .
They used a task called the Guilty Knowledge Test , where two subjects participate in a role - playing game and each is given either the role of an innocent person or a thief .
The researchers leave the two subjects alone for several minutes and the thief is instructed to steal money from a room while the innocent person waits outside , and then both subjects are interrogated .
To motivate the thief , he gets to keep the money if he can convince the researchers of his innocence .
In fact , the innocent person is a collaborator and the subject is always assigned the role of thief .
Just before the interrogation began , the subjects underwent either tDCS of the anterior prefrontal cortex or a sham operation where they sat in the machine but no current passed through it .
The subjects who underwent tDCS not only lied more frequently , but their lies were more convincing and they reported feeling less guilty about it afterwards .
The thieves got to keep the money .
The anterior prefrontal cortex seemed to serve the role of a moral compass , and without it people were able to lie more easily and with fewer qualms .
Exploration of the brain has helped elucidate one of human 's oldest tricks , lying , and has even taught us how to improve upon it .
When I told my friends about this possibility , they lightheartedly considered calling in sick to work the next day .
I am not advocating that we abandon truthfulness , for it clearly has great value .
I simply suggest that if someone goes to the trouble of baking your favorite dessert and , although you 're touched by the gesture , you cannot feign pleasure , perhaps you should consider becoming a better liar .
Sorry , we can’t find what you ’re looking for .

The astrologer made one prediction too far
The authorities in Sri Lanka have arrested a popular astrologer who predicted that the president will be ejected from office , police say .
Chandrasiri Bandara announced last week that the government would flounder in September and October because of political and economic problems .
The opposition have condemned the arrest and warned that the country is heading towards a dictatorship .
Astrology is taken seriously by numerous Sri Lankan politicians .
Inauspicious Police told the AP news agency that Mr Bandara told an opposition meeting that the prime minister would take over as president on 9 September and the opposition leader would become prime minister .
He was arrested on Wednesday night to investigate the basis of his prediction , police spokesman Ranjith Gunasekera said .
Mr Bandara made his forecast despite the president 's high approval ratings following the defeat of Tamil Tigers rebels in May , bringing an end to nearly 26 years of civil war .
" The CID ( Criminal Investigations Department ) is questioning the astrologer , " Mr Gunasekara said .
President Rajapaksa takes astrological predictions seriously
The astrologer predicted that a planetary change on 8 October will be inauspicious for parliament and the government may not be able to contain rising living costs - a forecast which correspondents say has already been made by private economists .
" The crime which Chandrasiri Bandara committed was publishing an astrological column which was adverse to the government , " said opposition United National Party General Secretary Tissa Attanayake .
So convinced are Sri Lankan politicians over the accuracy of astrology that many have their own personal seers who decide the auspicious times to launch any new initiative .
President Rajapaksa has declared himself to be a believer , telling foreign reporters earlier this year that he has often consulted a favoured astrologer for advice on what time to make speeches or to depart for trips .
Mr Bandara - who has a weekly television show and writes controversial political columns for a pro-opposition newspaper - is one of the most popular astrologers in the country .
Media rights groups have complained of continued efforts by the government to stifle freedom of speech despite the end of the war .
On Wednesday the main media organisations in the country urged the government not to re-establish a body that can fine and imprison print journalists .
According to Amnesty International , at least 14 journalists and staff at news outlets have been killed by suspected government paramilitaries and rebels since the beginning of 2006 .

The centre of politics has shifted .
As Barack Obama ’s victory and frantic first weeks in office prove , to talk about equality , fairness , control of markets and environmental sustainability is to reflect not just the aspirations , but the objective interests of the political mainstream .
The neoliberal thinking that dominated the industrial world for nearly 30 years has led to a financial crisis , which in turn caused the global downturn .
Yet if the United States has been seized by a new sense of hope , here in Britain there is a grim sense of business as usual .
The leaderships of the Conservative and Labour parties may advance different policies in response to the recession , but their underlying analyses are depressingly similar .
The downturn is there to be ridden out , whereupon politics and society will return to where they were .
A bunkered and backward - looking elite are now ignoring what is happening on the ground : in essence , we are caught in a very dangerous disjunction between the actions of career politicians and the aspirations of wider society .
The government ’s responses to changed times have been either too timid or , on the few occasions ministers have still affected to be radical , based on the very ideas that are now part of history .
As evidenced by the reluctance to insist on the separation of retail from investment banking , running through the supposed remedies for the financial crisis is a discredited belief in light - touch regulation .
Thanks to intense corporate lobbying , it now looks as if promised moves on the gender pay gap , flexible working and parental leave are on hold .
The same craven approach to corporate power explained the lamentable decision on a third runway at Heathrow .
Having long heard the claim that social democracy was held in check by powerful forces pushing in the opposite direction , we now find that , even at a moment of unprecedented opportunity , Labour still genuflects to the forces and interests of big business .
Look , for example , at the recent debate in cabinet about bonuses , and the contention – reportedly voiced by some ministers – that any harder line might somehow spoil Labour ’s business credentials .
To cap it all , the government is reprising the tired old trick of defining policy against its own side , and advocates part - privatisation of that totemic public institution , the Royal Mail .
Over the past three decades , private interests have been not just allowed , but encouraged , to eat into the public realm .
The dysfunctional consequences of uncontrolled markets have allowed government to grow ever more intrusive and controlling .
In the face of a growing environmental emergency , well - being and sustainability have become terms that embody little more than cynical window - dressing .
Now we have the worst economic crisis in at least 80 years .
Clearly , there can be no turning back to the failed and discredited politics of old .
Instead , we need to use this time of emergency to aim for a different future and to get there by different means .
The absence of forward thinking among the political class , however , is absurd .
It is as if , when in power , Clement Attlee would have quietly wished to back - pedal to the mess of the 1920s , or Margaret Thatcher had turned out to be nostalgic for the era of the three - day week and incomes policies .
Instead , both politicians realised that the people were moving to a new centre and they had the audacity to capitalise on it .
Today our leaders speak the language of defensive line - holding and incremental adjustment even as politics is in flux .
If the political elite do not address these new times , uglier forces may yet take their chance .
Take note : with the European elections looming , the British National Party may gain its first platform within national politics ; police intelligence predicts “ middle - class riots ” .
In response to the crisis of market fundamentalism , certain people ( including , ironically enough , some of those who have spent their entire careers spurning anything deemed “ Old Labour ” ) seem to have embraced a revival of a pre-Thatcher politics , whereby increasing the reach of the state becomes an end in itself and any idea of credible progressive values falls away .
We see this return to the old ways in the nationalisation of banks that leaves their essential structures and ethos unaltered , and the idea that we might speed our exit from recession only by calling time on sustainability in a dash for state - assisted jobs which leaves the fundamentals of the economy unchanged .
That agenda affects to speak to the moment , but has nothing convincing – let alone progressive – to say about the future .
We need green jobs , not jobs at any cost .
The old social - democratic promise was of incremental reform , more wage - bargained crumbs from the capitalist table and a larger slice of the cake for the masses – all delivered from the sanctuary of the Labour movement .
In 2009 , in the face of both increasing social breakdown and accelerating climate change , any renewal of this project will be hopelessly inadequate .
If there is to be no turning back to market fundamentalism , there can be no turning back to state and party fundamentalism , either .
Heroically , Old Labour tried to engineer a more equal society from the top down , but in a world that was no longer prepared to put up with deference , that project became suffocating , and was swept away by the new right and by the market fundamentalism that has shaped our world ever since .
Under Old Labour , the state failed ; under the Tories , markets were made too free .
New Labour tried to find a third way between the two .
But to split the difference between the old state and the free market was to build on the weakest possible foundations .
We should never underestimate the very real advances and improvements of the past 12 years : hugely increased investment in schools and hospitals , the minimum wage and improved rights at work , devolution to Scotland , Wales and Northern Ireland .
But now the contradictions and limits of the New Labour project are fully
exposed .
Such is its failure that we face the bitter irony of a Conservative victory in little more than a year ’s time – at just the moment that the country needs a leftward change of direction .
The starting point for a better future is the simple recognition that the Good Society is incompatible with market fundamentalism .
The purpose of free markets is to maximise profits .
This is beneficial for wealth creation and innovation , but there have to be limits .
Otherwise , not only will there be the kind of periodic crises we are now suffering , but , as our climate changes , the inexorable march of the market will threaten – indeed , is threatening – our very survival .
Markets never contain themselves .
Instead , they always look for new opportunities to make more profit .
This leads to no end of disastrous and dysfunctional outcomes : among them , the commercialisation of the lives of our children and the rise of the kinds of complex financial instruments that have brought the whole house down .
To turn society in a different direction , markets will have to be regulated and trammelled by social forces – the state and civil society .
We must put in place the institutions that
allow society to make the market its servant .
We cannot graft our conscience on to capitalism , as it were ; the point must be to direct it and constrain it in the interests of society at large .
The good life is one in which we , as citizens , have proper autonomy , the ability to decide and make our own fate .
We can achieve only a slim part of that alone .
Over the past three decades , the overriding feature of the Anglo - Saxon model of capitalism has been to transfer risk from society to the individual under the pretence of greater freedom .
But autonomy comes from collective decisions that change the big things about our lives , communities and planet .
The market , by contrast , erodes society and the democratic state because it wants us to make only personal consumer decisions .
When our politics surrenders to such individualised logic , it risks losing any real meaning .
Think back , for example , to Labour ’s campaign for the election of 2005 , and such pledges as “ Your family better off ” , “ Your child achieving more ” and “ Your family treated better and faster ” – not to mention Alan Milburn ’s claim that Labour ’s essential mission was to help more people “ earn and own ” .
Yet , even at Westminster , there are hints of something better .
Within New Labour there are people – “ left Brownites ” , crudely put , such as Ed Miliband , Douglas Alexander and Harriet Harman – who believe that more transformative change is desirable , but clearly not feasible .
David Cameron and some of his acolytes see the crisis in our politics and are trying to find a way out , talking about “ capitalism with a conscience ” .
Yet this will amount to mere talk unless the new progressives publicly denounce the central tenets of Thatcherism – the creator first of our social recession and now our economic depression .
More promisingly , swaths of people within the Labour movement – up to and including some MPs – know that the party ’s leadership is shrinking away from urgent challenges and failing to develop a modern version of progressive politics .
In 2007 , Jon Cruddas ’s campaign for the Labour deputy leadership , and his critique of the government , made him the figurehead of the party ’s centre left .
Now the unions and the TUC are making daring noises , not least through championing the Putting People First campaign ( tying together unions and NGOs under the banner of “ Jobs , Justice and Climate ” ) before next month ’s G20 meeting in London .
Among politicians , by far the most convincing and the boldest take on the financial crisis has come from the Liberal Democrats ’ Vincent Cable .
Within his party , so - called social liberals and
social democrats alike know that the era of market worship is over .
The Green Party , too , knows this .
Over the past decade think tanks and pressure groups – the New Economics Foundation , the Fabian Society , IPPR , Compass – have been pointing out the fragility of post - Thatcher politics and economics and sketching out what might lie beyond .
As proved by the rise of the “ Red Tory ” thinker Phillip Blond ( profiled in the NS , 23 February 2009 ) , even some Conservatives accept that unchecked markets and monopoly capitalism have left our society – and the wider world – weakened and divided .
What is more , the past decade has brought the growth of social movements , many with an international focus , which have implicitly held out the promise of a politics less in thrall to outdated dogmas and vested interests , and genuinely focused on attempts to create a more equal , sustainable world .
Those who marched against the Iraq War have resurfaced in organisations such as Plane Stupid , seeking to change the terms of debate about the way we live and the future of our planet .
In our communities , groups such as London Citizens are underlining the power of solidarity by winning demands for a living wage .
In addition , campaigns to stop the introduction of identity cards and to define a modern
liberty are going from strength to strength .
The case for equality for women in the workplace and in politics is being made as strongly as ever .
Moral leadership is coming from the churches .
And millions of ordinary people are doing what they can to change their lives and make those of others better – by buying ethically , recycling , volunteering and downshifting .
Across the Atlantic , the same was true of the diverse movements and groups which clustered around the Obama campaign .
With campaigning on the internet , change might come faster and easier .
This is all cause for optimism .
The catalyst for what must happen next is that we must simply refuse to go back .
We know the consequences of a desired return to “ normality ” : house - price bubbles , personal debt , boom and bust , insecurity and long hours at work , anxiety on the streets , stress in our homes , and fears about the survival of our planet .
What all of us who want a more equal , sustainable , democratic and liberal Britain and , indeed , world now have to recognise is that we can no longer go on trying to cope with the symptoms of market fundamentalism .
It is time to address their causes .
And to succeed in that , we have to work together .
Isolated measures on the environment or inequality are not enough ; single issues have to be joined up .
What this means is the creation of a politics that transcends tribal party lines .
The postwar settlement that delivered jobs , free health care , social insurance and decent education for all was built on the ideas of J M Keynes and William Beveridge ( both Liberals ) and Rab Butler ( a Tory ) .
No party has a monopoly of wisdom .
Meaningful and lasting change happens only when people join in the widest possible movements .
In the late 1980s , the Scottish Constitutional Convention brought together a range of people from parties , churches and other civic groups , and eventually delivered its aims , even in the teeth of opposition from Tony Blair .
Coalitions such as Charter 88 and the Countryside Alliance have caught people ’s imagination and had a palpable effect on organised politics .
We believe form follows function ; it is time for like - minded people to listen and speak to one another .
A few weeks ago , one of us shared a platform with a Labour - aligned speaker who claimed ( as usual ) that the party had to “ take on ” the
Liberal Democrats .
We suggested that if Vincent Cable ’s pronouncements were anything to go by , we should rather be talking to them .
It was encouraging that an audience made up largely of Labour activists heartily agreed .
None of this means that we have given up on the Labour Party or the role of the state .
A transformed Labour Party is still desirable – and feasible – as one of the most important means of the change that we seek .
But Labour is far from being transformed .
Besides , even capturing the state to give power away is no longer enough .
We can build a mixed economy in which the industries and services that the nation relies on to function are socialised , not privatised .
We can allow markets to flourish , but know we are better served by more plural and diverse means of production – such as social enterprise , voluntary organisations , mutuals and co-operatives .
We recognise that more democracy is nearly always the answer to the problems we face , not just in government , but in our workplaces and communities .
We can close the gap between the rich and the poor .
And we must put the needs of the planet before the blind pursuit of profit .
Once in a generation you have an opportunity to change society in profound ways .
For all the hardship and insecurity bound up in recent events , we are lucky to live in such a moment .
What seemed infallible until recently – the essential credo behind the last 30 years of economic history – has crumbled , like communism before it .
Yet this is not a crisis of capitalism , but a crisis of a society and democracy that have failed to regulate the market .
It will become a crisis for our planet , too , unless we resolve it .

Family say they cannot afford surgical help for surviving conjoined twin born with four arms and four legs
Thousands of people have flocked to a remote Nepalese village 2,000 metres up in the Himalayas to worship a baby born with four arms and four legs , revering him as the reincarnation of a Hindu god .
Villagers in the district of Ramechhap have said six - month - old Risab , who has a headless " parasitic twin " attached at the abdomen , is akin to the elephant god , Ganesh , whose various forms have between two and 16 arms .
" Some say he is like a god and they come to worship him and give money , " his 32 - year - old father , Rikhi Ghimire , said .
" They just give a few rupees , make an offering .
Mostly the gifts are food and clothes .
Others have said he looks like a monkey or is the child of a witch . "
About 5,000 people have visited the baby since he was born , according to local teacher Prem KC .
He says some have walked or taken long bus journeys from faraway districts .
A local Hindu priest has blamed the late and erratic monsoon rains on the baby .
" Some say it is a miracle or that it is God , and others say it is a curse .
There is a lack of awareness so villagers cannot understand it , " Ghimire said .
Risab 's mother , Januk , who has two other sons , was in severe pain for five days before the delivery and thought she would die during labour .
She gave birth in January on her porch with only her mother by her side .
" When he was born I was frightened about what the other villagers would say , " she said .
" If my husband had n't been there , I would have been scared they would say I was a witch and come and kill me . "
She says it is difficult to care for the child and even simple activities such as putting him to sleep , bathing or putting oil on him – a common practice for newborn babies in Nepal – are not easy .
The family live in a one - room house made of clay and stone and shared with goats and chickens , one day 's walk away from the nearest main town .
Rikhi , who works in the fields all day , says he took Risab to a hospital in Kathmandu , the capital , where doctors said they would have to monitor him for six months .
But as he could not afford to stay in the city , he was forced to return to the village with the baby .
Rikhi wants his son to have an operation so that he can have a " normal life " , but says the family cannot even afford to take him out of the country to seek surgical advice .
" It 's not a small operation .
It needs a huge amount of money which I cannot provide , " he said .
Dr Sujan Patan , a doctor at Kathmandu medical college , said it was the first case of its kind he had seen .
" It may be possible to operate , " he said .

Temperatures are gradually descending , with fall around the corner .
We may enjoy watching the leaves change color , breaking out comfortable sweaters , and tuning into college football .
One not - so - nice change is cooler , drier air which can cause our patients with dry eyes to struggle .
Cooler and drier air increases the rate that our tears evaporate .
Windy conditions and time spent outdoors especially accelerate this effect .
Classic dry eye symptoms include grittiness , visual fluctuation with blinking , excessive tearing , and redness .
What can you do to prepare for Dry Eye season ?
Conservative measures can be a good first step .
Artificial tears such as Refresh Relieva and Systane Complete are good starting points .
These over - the - counter drops are typically used between 2 - 4 x per day .
These drops hydrate our ocular surface and temporarily relieve symptoms .
Contact lens wearers may try Refresh Relieva for Contacts , also over - the - counter .
Applying heat with a warm compresses can also be beneficial .
A soft microwavable heating pad works best ; once heated to a very warm but tolerable temperature , it can be applied to closed eyelids for 10 minutes .
Usually patients do this twice daily .
These measures can be helpful but often patients need more help .
Advanced Eye Care Center offers specialized dry eye evaluations aided by LipiView .
LipiView is a unique technology that analyzes tear film quality , blink rate , as well as oil gland health .
We believe in customized dry eye treatment plans specific to each patient .
Additional treatment may include prescription - strength dry eye drops , LipiFlow , punctal plugs , oral medication , etc .
Let us help you get through Dry Eye season .
Dr. Ballitch and Dr. Finn can help your eyes feel their best !

Ventnor Blog -- August 5 , 6 pm , 2009 -- With Mike Godley having left yesterday , we spoke to Mark , one of the six who are still inside at the Vestas sit-in .
We discussed how they had to reorganise themselves now four people have left .
He said that that morale was still good and how they ’ll “ still be fighting Vestas ” .
Mark explained that “ It was strange to have that many people leaving at once . ”
It ’s unclear if Vestas have applied for bailiff papers to have them removed from the building .
Vestas have issued a statement that they are very patient and that they can wait .
Mark said , “ They did ask us yesterday that if we wanted to leave the door open they would come in and get us .
We replied ‘ No ’ . ”
Those inside had thought that the bailiffs might have gone in last night , but nothing happened in the end .
Mark said that “ When they do come to get us , we will leave peacefully . ”

The British Guardian reports late on August 6 :
Six workers who have been staging a sit-in at Britain 's only major wind turbine factory for more than two weeks called today for a national day of action to support their attempt to save it from closure with the loss of more than 600 jobs .
The men , who say they are determined to remain inside the Vestas Wind Systems plant on the Isle of Wight until bailiffs come to remove them , want people around the country to show support on Wednesday August 12 by downing tools for an hour , holding a rally or hanging up a banner .
Meanwhile many of the workers who left the occupation yesterday of their own accord returned to the site , on an industrial estate outside Newport , to support their colleagues from the outside .
Asked what the experience inside had been like , Chris Ash replied : " The Big Brother house . "
He explained : " You 've got to ration all the tobacco , all the food , you 've got to wash stuff in the sinks .
It 's really tough .
Being away from your loved ones , not being able to do normal stuff .
" When you came out on the balcony and could see your friends and family outside , that was hard .
You 'd think , ' Can I do this ? ' "
Since leaving , Ash said he had had a shower , a shave , seen his cats and treated himself to some fish and chips .
After that it was straight back to the plant , where he spent yesterday evening and has been since early this morning .
" I plan to stay here for the forseeable future , " he said .
" The lads inside are doing a tremendous job .
I could n't physically do it any more . "
Like Big Brother housemates , the occupiers have gone to some lengths to keep themselves amused .
Michael Godley revealed that he and another worker who has come out had written a musical about the occupation using alternative words to well - known songs including Michael Jackson 's ``Beat It '' and Gloria Gaynor 's ` `I Will Survive ' ' .
The men have acted it out and filmed it , ready to screen when they have all left the building .
Godley called on people around the country and on the Isle of Wight to show their support to the men left inside .
It is thought the company will not act quickly to remove them .
" We need more islanders to get involved , especially the other workers " , Godley said .
" There 's 600 of them who have already got two weeks ' extra pay and more redundancy money because of what we 've done .
We need them to get on board . "
On August 4 , Vestas won a repossession order allowing it to remove the men .
Four then left of their own accord , while the others vowed to stay on .
Another five activists are occupying the roof of another site owned by the Danish company , in East Cowes .
They have set up a climate camp on the steep sloping surface complete with tents , a kitchen and a toilet .

August 4 , 2009 -- Morning Star --
Six defiant Vestas workers have vowed to continue their battle for green jobs and energy after bosses at the threatened wind turbine factory on the Isle of Wight won a possession order .
As workers prepared for the arrival of bailiffs , they urged the British people to stage a day of action this weekend and pledged to continue their campaign even if they were forcibly evicted .
" We are just waiting now to see what happens " , said one of the activists from a factory balcony .
" But we will not stop our protest , we will merely move down the road until we get results . "
Not far from the factory on a mini-roundabout , green campaigners have established a climate camp , with colourful banners hung from nearby walls -- including one condemning " Mandelson 's green failure " .
The group of 11 workers have barricaded themselves into the Newport factory since July 20 .
So far , the occupation has prevented its closure -- which was meant to take place on July 31 -- but Vestas bosses successfully applied for a possession order at Newport County Court yesterday ( August 3 ) morning .
Judge Graham
White said he was satisfied that legal papers had been served on the occupying workers , as scores of RMT union members and green activists gathered outside in solidarity with the workers and jeered him for siding with the employers .
Many of them then marched to the Newport factory in a show of solidarity with the workers .
Protesters gathered outside the plant and chanted : " We will fight back . "
One of the occupying workers addressed them from a balcony , praising their solidarity and calling for a national day of action on August 8 and again on August 12 .
" We are asking people to down tools or hold a rally to support us .
We want the protest to continue but we also want it to remain peaceful " , he said .
" We believe this place has a future and we shall not give up on that . "
RMT general secretary Bob Crow was in court for the hearing and pledged his union 's ongoing support for the workers .
He also slammed the Labour government 's hypocrisy .
" Although the company has won a technical legal victory , the workers have won a moral and industrial victory through their sheer determination to save 625 jobs in green manufacturing " , he said .
" It is an absolute disgrace that , while the government preaches about greening the environment and creating jobs , not a single representative from Climate Change Secretary Ed Miliband downwards have had the common courtesy to meet with workers involved in this important fight . ''
" Regardless of the court action today , the workers will continue to receive the full support of the RMT , " Mr Crow insisted .
Earlier in the day , worker and climate camp activists occupied the roof of a nearby Vestas factory in Cowes and unveiled banners attacking ministers and bosses in a fresh show of solidarity with the Newport protesters .
They also hung a banner above the island 's ferry port saying : " Vestas Workers -- Solidarity in Occupation .
Save Green Jobs . "
Cowes worker Sean McDonagh told reporters that there was little chance of finding another skilled job on the island if the wind turbine business shut down .
He revealed that there were just 145 job vacancies on the Isle of Wight at the moment , with 60 people chasing each and every last one .
McDonagh went on to accuse ministers of " lying " about creating green jobs , slating the Brown government as " a complete sham " .
The Newport occupiers said that they were now waiting for bailiffs to arrive but there was no information about when any move might be made to end the sit-in .
Later in the day , following a discussion among the occupiers , several workers left the plant to join the protesters outside .
Discussion continues inside and outside as to the tactics to adopt following the eviction order .
Message from the Vestas workers
August 4 , 2009 -- Ventnor Blog --
Once everyone had returned from the court hearing in Newport , the lads on the balcony gave their speech to the crowd of supporters and media outside the Vestas factory .
Sebastian Sikora ( or ‘ Seb the Celeb ’ as he has become more fondly known ) made an address over the PA system .
Speaking on behalf of all the workers on the balcony , he called for a national day of action this coming Saturday ( and Wednesday next week ) .
He suggested that you down tools of an hour or do something for your community to show your support .
He went on to say that the workers inside wanted to make the point that the security and police had been good to them and that they were just ordinary good people making a living and had families to feed - they were not the enemy .
He went onto say that the managers felt that Vestas factory had no future , but the workers begged to differ .
“ Changes should be made for the people , not for the money . ”
Apologies for the wind disturbance .
Appeal to supporters to respect workers ' wishes
August 4 , 2009 -- Ventnor Blog --
Some people in the crowd were suggesting that others should occupy the Vestas building .
The Vestas workers wanted this protest to continue in the peaceful way it started and has continued .
RMT official Richard stepped forward and asked that the wishes of the workers inside be respected .
At the Netroots Nation conference yesterday Bill Clinton responded forcefully when heckled by gay activist and blogger Lane Hudson on the topics of Do n’t Ask , Do n’t Tell ( DADT ) , and the Defense of Marriage Act ( DOMA ) .

Simple rice pudding is basically made with rice , sugar and milk , flavored with orange zest .
It is one of the best light desserts ever !
Do you like rice pudding ?
It is one of the simplest cold desserts to satisfy your sweet tooth in summer .
You just need 3 ingredients to make an easy rice pudding : milk , rice and sugar .
This creamy pudding is a perfect treat even plain , but you can turn it into an elegant dessert by adding some extra ingredients like nuts , fresh or dried fruit , lemon zest or orange zest .
Mom would make it very often when I was a kid , and I would never get bored of eating it !
Depending on the season , she would add a new ingredient every time she made it .
She would add dried fruit in this sweet rice pudding in winter like raisins , dried apricots or figs and she would top it with fresh fruit like strawberries , melon slices or other summer fruit .
She would even top it with ice cream , but not as often as I ’d like !
Knowing the simple version of sweet rice pudding , you can create your own dessert with the ingredient you add into it !
We call it sutlac in Turkish and there are two main versions of sweet rice pudding in Turkish cuisine ; Oven Baked Rice Pudding and stove cooked rice pudding .
Oven baked version is a bit more difficult , but it ’s worth .
Its slightly burned top is to die for !
This one does n’t have many varieties unlike the one cooked on stove .
It is mostly baked in mini clay pots and topped with hazelnuts or pistachio .
Mom is with us now helping us with our baby and she ’s constantly making rice pudding saying that it increases the amount and the quality of breast milk .
If I eat it everyday as mom wants , I ’m sure it increases my weight too !
I do n’t have any problems with the production of my breast milk , so I think it works besides the other foods and drinks mom wants me to have .
She made it with raisins and orange zest this time since this combination is one of my favorites .
You can add your favorite fruit instead .

August 05 , 2009 " Washington Times " -- ---
The United States is quietly pressing Iraq not to close a camp that holds more than 3,000 members of an Iranian opposition group that served as Saddam Hussein 's shock troops in 1991 when he crushed rebellions after the Gulf War and now is vulnerable to Iraqi and Iranian reprisals .
Last week , Iraqi police stormed Camp Ashraf outside Baghdad , killing at least seven and injuring dozens during clashes with the Mujahedeen-e Khalq , or MEK .
At the time , members of a U.S. unit known as Task Force 134 , which deals with prisoners of war , were present outside the compound , said two U.S. officials -- one in Washington , one in Iraq -- who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue .
A day after the raid , officials at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad met with members of the Iraqi government to urge restraint .
The next day , the U.S. Army helped medevac at least two dozen injured members of the MEK , the officials said .
Many Iranians despise the group for siding with Iraq during the 1980 - 88 Iran - Iraq war .
Iraqi Shi'ites have grievances that grow out of the MEK 's participation in crushing an uprising in southern Iraq after the 1991 Gulf War .
The U.S. has designated the MEK as a terrorist group for these actions and for the assassinations of six Americans in Iran before the 1979 Iranian revolution .
But the U.S. nevertheless has sought to protect Camp Ashraf members -- who include women and children -- from Iraqi or Iranian attack and forced repatriation .
The camp had been under U.S. protection since the 2003 invasion of Iraq .
Iraq now seeks to reassert control under the provisions of the Status of Forces Agreement signed with Washington last year .
Iraqi media have reported that the government plans to close Camp Ashraf and disperse its residents to other locations in Iraq .
Such a move could make the dissidents more vulnerable to Iranian intelligence and angry Iraqi Shi'ites who lost family members in 1991 .
" Embassy officials met with representatives from the Government of Iraq [ GOI ] on July 29 , to stress the importance of the GOI fulfilling its commitment to the United States Government to treat Ashraf 's residents humanely and to propose permitting an assessment of injuries and deaths by U.S. forces , " one U.S. official wrote in an e-mail to The Washington Times .
" The GOI allowed a U.S. medical assessment team to enter Ashraf and subsequently approved joint U.S. - Iraqi medical assistance to injured MEK Ashraf residents .
" A spokesman for the Iraqi government , Ali al - Dabbagh , acknowledged that there had been meetings with Americans about the subject .
" There will be no plans to move [ the MEK members ] anywhere in the short term , " he said , denying the Iraqi media reports .
" We are thinking of their security about finding a safer place .
But till now , this plan is not yet approved . " Mr. al - Dabbagh added that MEK members would not be sent to Iran or any third country against their will .
President Clinton designated the MEK as a foreign terrorist organization .
However , in 2002 , the group disclosed that Iran was building a secret nuclear facility south of Tehran .
The MEK also claims to have provided valuable intelligence on the Iranian regime to the U.S. military and to no longer commit acts of terrorism .
Over the years , the organization has touted itself as a viable opposition movement against Iran , even though it appears to have minimal support within Iran and there is a cult of personality around the group 's leader , Maryam Rajavi .
Still , the group has cultivated allies in the U.S. Congress who have pressed the State Department to remove the MEK and affiliated groups from its list of foreign terrorists .
Steven Schneebaum , an attorney for relatives and friends of some Camp Ashraf residents , said that last week 's raid proves the Iraqis already have violated their pledge to treat the MEK in a humane manner .
" There was an agreement apparently made at the end of 2008 between the United States and the government , a side agreement for the Status of Forces Agreement , in which the Iraqis promised that they would treat the people of Ashraf humanely and in accordance with international norms , " he said .
" They are not doing that .
There are a dozen , give or take , killed , 400 injured and 36 who have been removed from Ashraf . " Mr. Schneebaum said the 36 had been " abducted " to a police station and that there was " concern that they have been physically abused already . "
Mr. al - Dabbagh said the Iraqi forces were under orders not to use live ammunition and that any injuries were caused by vehicles .
One of the U.S. officials said the MEK residents used crude weapons such as stones , rocks and clubs to confront Iraqi police .
Raymond Tanter , a member of the National Security Council in the Reagan administration who co-founded and is president of the Iran Policy Committee -- a Washington group that advocates lifting the MEK 's terrorist designation -- said Iraqi National Security Adviser Mowaffak al - Rubaie told him that Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki 's government intends to destroy the camp , disperse its residents and send MEK leaders to Iran .
" Dispersal of the rank and file and extradition of the individuals with so - called blood on their hands is the game plan for the Iraqi government .
I know this because this is what the Iraqi government has said , " Mr. Tanter said .
Rep. Howard L. Berman , California Democrat and chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee , and Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida , the committee 's ranking Republican , issued a statement last week expressing concern about the situation at Camp Ashraf .
" The Government of Iraq signed an agreement with the United States guaranteeing the physical security and protection of Ashraf residents following the withdrawal of U.S. forces from the area , " the statement said .
" The Iraqi government must live up to its commitment to ensure the continued well - being of those living in Ashraf and prevent their involuntary return to Iran . "

While malicious software has long been a near - daily annoyance for Windows PCs , Mac users have become accustomed to not worrying about malware .
Threats arise from time to time — in January of this year , for example , a Trojan horse made the rounds in pirated copies of Apple ’s iWork software — but most Mac users these days are probably running computers without antivirus software .
Apple has encouraged that habit , too , by frequently touting the Mac ’s resistance to malware in its advertising materials , especially when compared to Windows .
But with the release of Mac OS X 10.6 ( Snow Leopard ) , Apple has finally decided to subtly step up its fight against malware , much as it has done in the past with antiphishing features in Safari .
For the first time , the Mac OS contains a built - in system that detects malicious software and attempts to protect users from inadvertently damaging their computers .
How does it work ?
Beginning with Mac OS X 10.4 , Apple built a download validation system called File Quarantine into its operating system .
In OS X 10.5 ( Leopard ) , this manifested most frequently as a dialog box that popped up when a user first opened a file that was downloaded from the Internet via Mail , Safari , or iChat .
The warning revealed which application downloaded the file , from what site , and at what time .
It gave the user the option to continue opening the file , to cancel , or to view the Web page from which it had been downloaded .
In Snow Leopard , Apple has enhanced File Quarantine to also check files against known malware , pulling from a list of malware definitions at System / Library / Core Services/CoreTypes.bundle/Contents/Resources/XProtect.plist .
As of this writing , the file contains only two definitions : the OSX.RSPlug .
A Trojan Horse , first discovered in 2007 , and the OSX .
iService malware embedded in the pirated iWork installer mentioned earlier .
However , Apple told Macworld that the list of definitions can be updated via Software Update .
If you try to open an infected file , Snow Leopard will present you with a stronger warning , saying that the file may damage your computer and suggesting that you move it to the Trash .
As with the download validation dialog box , you have the option to continue or cancel , but if the file is on a disk image , there ’s a button to eject the image ; if , on the other hand , the file is already on your hard drive , that button instead invites you to move the file to the Trash .
If you ’ve enabled Safari ’s Open " Safe " Files After Downloading preference , you will automatically be prompted with the dialog box when the download completes and the file opens .
Unlike the more general warning , the malware warning does n't disappear after the first instance ; it will reappear each time you open the file .
File Quarantine seems to serve mainly as a gatekeeper for files downloaded from untrusted sources : think of it as a layer between the user and the untamed wilds of the Internet .
Snow Leopard defines an expanded list of applications for which it " quarantines " downloaded files ( marking that they 've been downloaded from the Internet ) .
So if you download a file via your Web browser ( including Safari , Internet Explorer , Firefox , OmniWeb , Opera , Mozilla , Camino , and more ) or an e-mail client ( Mail , Entourage , or Thunderbird ) or you receive a file via iChat , then it will be checked for malware when you open it .
However , if you grab an infected file from another source , such as an FTP site , a file - sharing service like BitTorrent , or a program that ’s not covered by Apple ’s system , then you ’re out of luck — the system wo n’t detect it .
Most important , Apple ’s system appears to contain no way to clean malicious software off your Mac after it ’s been infected .
For that , it seems you ’ll still need to turn to third - party antivirus products .
Does it work ?
In our tests , the malware system successfully detected the OSX.RSPlug Trojan horse upon trying to open a file infected with it .
The dialog box appeared regardless of whether the file was located on a disk image or the computer ’s hard disk , as long as the file had been downloaded onto that computer via one of the applications that Apple 's system checks .
Because Apple uses the com.apple .
quarantine extended attribute ( which stores metadata about the file ) to record the information about malware , that information can actually travel from Mac to Mac .
However , whether the metadata remains with the file depends on exactly how the file is transmitted .
If it ’s copied via OS X ’s file system — to a flash drive , for example , or via the Finder ’s built - in file sharing — then the malware mark will stay emblazoned on the file like Hester Prynne ’s big red A .
However , if you transfer the file through another method — say , via FTP — that metadata will be lost .
( There is one exception : zipping the file using OS X's built - in compression tools will keep the quarantine attribute present even if you transfer the file via FTP . )
Of course , malware protection is only as good as its definitions .
It ’s unknown how often Apple plans to update the virus definitions in Snow Leopard : such updates could be bundled into Security Updates and point releases the way that security patches currently are , either on an ad hoc basis as new threats arise or as a more regular set of updates delivered through Software Update .
Apple has been criticized in the past for its sluggish response to security threats , so how it will handle this new system remains to be seen .
What does it all mean ?
Now that OS X has built - in malware support , what does that mean for Mac users ?
Well , here are a few things it does n’t mean .
It does n’t mean that a flood of malware will suddenly overwhelm Mac OS X .
Yes , Apple ’s integration of an anti-malware system is a tacit admission that Mac OS X is far from immune to malicious software , but the company 's response is more a prudent precaution than a reaction to an impending tide of evil software .
It also does n’t mean that Mac users can go about downloading files willy - nilly , with no regard for safety .
As always , every computer user , regardless of their computing platform , should take certain precautions : download files from trusted sources ; do n’t open e-mail attachments from unknown senders ; make sure you assign strong passwords to your accounts .
Malware prevention software can keep you from being caught unaware , but it does n’t give you carte blanche to be irresponsible , any more than having a car alarm means you should go out of your way to park your car in a dangerous neighborhood .
And it does n’t mean that third - party antivirus software makers like Symantec and Intego are going out of business .
That ’s often a concern when Apple jumps into an established software field , but as the company told Macworld , “ The feature is n’t intended to replace or supplant antivirus software , but affords a measure of protection against the handful of known Trojan horse applications that exist for the Mac today . ”
Snow Leopard ’s protection is more of a preventive measure than a cure for malware .
In sum , this added security is a good thing for most Mac users , especially those who have long eschewed antivirus software : we now have an additional level of protection that we did n’t have before .
It 's not bulletproof , but the next time you look a gift horse in the mouth , at least you 'll know whether it 's full of Greek warriors .
Viewed from the other side of the Atlantic , the US looks like a land where freedom of thought and speech has delivered an enviable wealth of ideas .
American history embraces a catalogue of innovators and pioneers , from Benjamin Franklin and Eli Whitney through Thomas Edison and even Bill Gates .
New ideas open up new opportunities .
But fear now competes with freedom to be the driving force behind the American economy .
The freedom to discover the next good idea is cowed by the fear of losing what is already owned .
But that is the nature of innovation - searching for the next valuable idea means risking the idea that went before .
It was not always so .
Once upon a time the US was a young nation , greedy to learn and to grow .
Benjamin Franklin was an innovator , but he also engaged in piracy .
Franklin , like others , republished the works of 18th century British authors without giving them any reward in exchange for copying their words .
As early as 1808 , the poet William Wordsworth complained about exploitation and argued for copyright to be extended .
The most popular novelist of the Victorian era , Charles Dickens , lobbied Congress during his North American speaking tours , protesting that the copyright of British authors should be recognized in the US .
His pleas fell on deaf ears .
America needed the wealth of new ideas and lacked libraries .
For Americans to benefit from education and entertainment , so the argument went , necessitated cutting costs , and that meant not rewarding the British authors who should be satisfied with the rewards received elsewhere .
And was not the success of Dickens ' tours a real demonstration that piracy helped authors , rather than hindering them ?
The argument went on to assert that Dickens benefited most from the enhancement of his reputation gained by the wide circulation of his work .
Whether Dickens thought so or not , the Americans had decided this was worth more than profiting from the sale of fewer books bearing his name .
Does that sound familiar ?
It should , because we hear the same debate today .
The difference is that the tables have turned and now the US is concerned that its valuable copyrights are exploited by those greedy , growing , countries .
Whilst the struggle for copyright is sometimes seen as a battle between nations , it is also a battle of will within national borders .
The emergence of a political movement in European countries , the Pirate Party movement , tells us something about the strength of feeling across an increasingly polarized debate .
Businesses pursue stringent fines for P2P filesharers .
Governments enforce stricter laws to protect copyright .
Citizens respond by forming new political parties and canvassing for votes .
There is a Pirate Party in the US too , though the nature of American democracy makes it very unlikely they will break through and raise the profile of copyright reform .
The frontline of the US copyright debate is the courtroom , not the ballot box .
In contrast , the very existence of electoral alternatives has enabled European parties to secure valuable attention in mainstream media .
In only the first month since being launched , the Pirate Party UK has secured room for the debate about copyright reform in every quality British newspaper , on television and radio , and of course all over the internet .
All of this is encouraging for a party that wants people to freely exchange their thoughts , and is a signal that even in rich countries , many see the appeal of less stringent copyright .
The counterargument to copyright reform is that there will be losers .
The losers are supposed to be those who create , or the losers will be all of us .
The conclusion is that either the creators receive lesser rewards for their work , and so they will be poorer , or the creators will simply create less and will do other jobs instead , leaving us all poorer .
But Dickens did not stop writing because of American exploitation of his words .
If anything , he was inspired by it - inspired to respond via Martin Chuzzlewit .
The same internet that enables instantaneous and mass duplication of copyright works has transformed many other markets .
The internet enables middlemen to be stripped out of supply and distribution , and the benefits are passed on to the consumer through lower costs .
Take this to its logical limit and you do end up with an extreme - the same extreme as Benjamin Franklin not sharing the profits from the works he pirated .
But far from ending creation , piracy simply changes the market dynamics .
One source of revenue is closed , not all sources .
Dickens made money by speaking .
Musicians can make money from live performances or merchandise .
The copyrighted content stops being a marketable product and instead becomes the fulcrum for a kind of marketing .
This marketing is all the more powerful because it is spread from individual to individual , and cannot be manipulated by business interests .
In other words , people promote the content they like , not the content they are told to like , and all studies show that we trust the recommendations of friends and ordinary folks far more than we trust celebrity endorsements and slick corporate promotion .
The evidence is that this peer - to - peer advertising is effective in creating new revenues .
This is a threat to the jobs of some middlemen , who are paid to influence the market , but is a boon to consumers and puts market power and intelligence back into the hands of the people who should be dictating what is popular and what is not .
The significance of the advertising effect of free content is demonstrated by the observed correlation that the most prolific downloaders of pirated content also spend the most to legitimately buy content .
With a marketplace in rapid transition , it can be hard to identify all the factors that cause it to happen .
The digital marketplace for copyrighted content does more than increase the potential to freely copy works that were originally created with profit in mind .
It also reduces barriers to entry .
It reduces them so far , that , at the extreme , the marketplace collapses .
People just give and take freely .
This has been observed already with open source software .
We see it with the rise in so - called ' user - generated content ' on sites like YouTube .
' User - generated ' is a euphemism for ' not to be taken seriously because it does not have a big budget ' .
Thanks to the democratizing effect of other technological improvements , married to the free distribution mechanism of the internet , then all it takes to create a popular song is to possess a guitar and a microphone , without the need for a marketing budget .
Beneath the veil of piracy , the real factor that drives down prices is the proliferation of competition , from small business , from micro business , from hobbyists and people who create for the pleasure of friends .
Resetting the marketplace so that many can produce for many will diminish some business models .
It also creates new ones .
If you cannot profit by controlling a much - sought copy of one work , perhaps you can profit by using the work to attract people to other goods and services , or by embedding the work within another product .
The music industry has recognized this , and now seeks to make more from new activities like selling t- shirts with lyrics written on them .
This is innovation in the true sense - instead of just creating variations on an established theme , the goal is to develop genuinely new kinds of products .
Supply and demand suggests that the money saved on certain kinds of products just gets spent on others .
This is the basis of the real value proposition for any economy .
Either it remains stagnant , and tries to protect existing business models , or it is open to change and incubates new business models .
Copyright was created for an old business model , and not a very good one at that .
Technology has moved on from the time when printing presses were expensive and distribution of content was physical .
Many of us may love Mickey Mouse , but perpetually extending Disney 's copyright stifles creation instead of encouraging it .
Governments that try to preserve existing business models by defending copyright are missing the point of how creative people with few barriers of entry to a huge potential market will short - circuit big businesses over time .
Some will give work away just to get the foothold of recognition .
Unhappy that your publisher does not promote your work ?
Then give it away and bet that the audience will see talent where the publisher does not .
Giving his work away made Brazilian novelist Paulo Coelho successful .
At the same time , discretionary spend on entertainment and education will still be spent on education and entertainment .
That means new markets open up as others close .
If people can get recorded music for free , then they have more money to spend on live performances .
Or if they want something to enjoy at home , consumers will shift their spending from music to other content like video games , and this research suggests that is just what people have been doing .
Seen in that context , it makes perfect sense for music businesses to change tack ; if they cannot sell direct to the consumer , sell to the people who make games instead .
This is innovation , and it is good for customers , even if painful for those businesses that lack the imagination or agility to keep pace with change .
America has been the great innovator , but having reached a pinnacle of power and influence , it may be tempted to sit back and exploit the accumulated wealth of its knowledge so far .
To do so would be the worst mistake possible for the American economy .
Innovation , experimentation , change - these are the ways to keep on creating world - beating formulas .
Monopolies of ideas are profitable only for those that control them .
That means monopolies should not be allowed to live on longer than fairly required to recoup the initial investment that was needed to turn the idea into a reality .
Money spent on enforcing and maintaining those monopolies for longer than needed is money not spent on developing alternative products .
New capabilities inevitably give rise to new markets and these are the real and pervasive threat to old monopolies .
The iPod allowed people to listen to as much music as they like , wherever they like , but it also gave birth to podcasting and a new world of creative opportunity .
Listening to a free podcast means less time to listen to an album of music that you pay for .
Sales of volumes of Encyclopedia Britannica collapsed in the face of rivals sold on CD - ROMs , and Wikipedia begs the question of why anyone should pay for reference texts .
News services are happy to reuse the amateur 's view of major events , in the form of bystander photographs and videos , tweets and commentary from blogs .
Such amateur content squeezes the market for professionals , but that does not mean amateur content should be prohibited or limited , or that the reader or viewer would be better informed by content that only came from professional sources .
The US has got ahead by creating new ideas , not by only expoliting them .
Now , more than ever , piracy and the dissolution of barriers to entry mean new ideas have to be imagined and delivered at ever greater speed .
You can try to slow the progress of competitors , but if that is all you do , they will still overtake you soon enough .
America should avoid the temptation to pour more and more resources into protecting its current intellectual assets .
Intellectual assets only retain value if rivals lack the imagination to make something better .
In a world where ideas are spread ever more easily , the dominance of a good idea will be shorter and shorter .
America should stick to what it does best - investing in creating the future .
If that means encouraging the next generation of Benjamin Franklins , that can only be a good thing .

August 12 , 2009 , ( Pal Telegraph ) -
On the 5th of August Victor Agosto , received a 30 - day prison sentence for refusing to deploy to Afghanistan .
Victor Agosto joined the army in 2005 and served a 13 - month tour of duty in Iraq ; according to reports , his experience there and what he describes as " self education " about US foreign policy and international law convinced him that " the occupation [ in Afghanistan ] is immoral and unjust " .
Victor Agosto received a relatively light sentence after accepting a plea agreement .
However , others have been dealt with more harshly , receiving sentences of up to 15 months ' imprisonment .
The maximum penalty could amount to several years .
US law recognizes the right to conscientious objection only on grounds of opposition to all war in any form .
Thus , soldiers who object to serving in a particular war currently have no way of legally registering for exemption on this ground .
Some have their applications for conscientious objection refused ; others , knowing such applications to be futile , go " absent without leave " .
Currently there are other soldiers who face imprisonment for their beliefs .
For example , Travis Bishop is scheduled to be court -- martialled at Fort Hood , Texas , on 14 August , for refusing to deploy to Afghanistan .
If imprisoned , Amnesty International would consider him to be a prisoner of conscience .
Amnesty International has recognised as prisoners of conscience a number of US soldiers refusing to deploy to Iraq or Afghanistan because of their conscientious objection to the armed conflict .
They included Camilo Mejía , who was sentenced to one year 's imprisonment for his objection to the armed conflict in Iraq in 2004 , and Abdullah Webster , who refused to participate in the same war due to his religious beliefs and was sentenced the same year to 14 months ' imprisonment .
Another , Kevin Benderman , was sentenced in 2005 to 15 months ' imprisonment after he refused to re-deploy to Iraq because of abuses he allegedly witnessed there .
Agustin Aguayo was sentenced to eight months ' imprisonment for his refusal to participate in the armed conflict in Iraq .
All four have since been released .
Some of these conscientious objectors have been court - martialled and sentenced despite pending applications for conscientious objector status , others were imprisoned after their applications were turned down on the basis that they were objecting to particular wars rather than to war in general .
In addition , Amnesty International has appealed to the Canadian authorities not to deport US soldiers claiming conscientious objection to serving in the US military .
Around 200 soldiers are reported to have fled to Canada , where some have sought refugee protection .
Amnesty International believes the right to refuse to perform military service for reasons of conscience is part of freedom of thought , conscience and religion , as recognised in Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Article 18 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , which the USA has ratified .
Amnesty International considers a conscientious objector to be any person who , for reasons of conscience or profound conviction , either refuses to perform any form of service in the armed forces or applies for non-combatant status .
This can include refusal to participate in a war because one disagrees with its aims or the manner in which it was being waged , even if one does not oppose taking part in all wars .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Microsoft
Corp posted the first - ever drop in annual sales of Windows and its quarterly revenue fell a steeper - than - expected 17 percent as its business continued to be hurt by the weak global PC and server markets .

The news sent Microsoft shares down 8 percent and took the shine off a big U.S. stock market rally earlier in the day that had driven the Dow Jones industrial average above 9,000 points .
The world ’s largest software maker , whose operating systems power the vast majority of the world ’s personal computers , offered little hope for a turnaround in technology until next year , despite recent optimism from rival International Business Machines Corp and chip maker Intel Corp .
“ We still see conditions being challenging for the balance of this calendar year , ” Chief Financial Officer Christopher Liddell said in a telephone interview .
“ At least sequentially , we are seeing a little bit of growth .
While things are not necessarily getting better , they may have bottomed out , ” said Liddell .
LIGHT ON REVENUE
Microsoft reported fiscal fourth quarter net profit of $ 3.045 billion , or 34 cents per share , compared with $ 4.297 billion , or 46 cents per share , in the year - ago quarter .
Profit excluding items was 36 cents per share for the quarter ended June 30 , meeting analysts ’ average forecast , according to Reuters Estimates .
Sales fell 17 percent to $ 13.1 billion , missing analysts ’ average estimate of $ 14.48 billion .
Annual sales of the company ’s Windows operating system -- its first and most important business -- fell for the first time on record .
“ They were really light on revenue .
They need to explain where the money went .
If I was Nancy Drew this would be the case of the missing revenue , ” said Kim Caughey , senior analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group , referring to the fictional detective .
Wall Street highlighted the lack of big tech projects .
“ Spending has been sparse by businesses and we ’re not in full recovery mode yet , ” said Laxmi Poruri , partner at Primary Global Research .
“ We ’re not in big - ticket mode , which is businesses purchasing a lot of equipment and a lot of software .
They ’re doing small projects and that ’s going to hurt your margins .
SLASHING COSTS
Microsoft is preparing to bring out the latest version of its operating system , Windows 7 , on October 22 .
Liddell said that release would not , on its own , spark a recovery in PC sales .
With sales under pressure , the Redmond , Washington - based company is focusing on controlling costs , announcing 5,000 job cuts in January .
For fiscal year 2010 , which started July 1 , the company is targeting $ 26.6 billion to $ 26.9 billion in operating expenses , slightly cutting the lower end of its estimate from three months ago .
Comparable expenses in the fiscal year just ended were $ 25.4 billion .
Microsoft ’s shares fell 8 percent to $ 23.44 in extended trading , after closing up 3 percent at $ 25.56 on Nasdaq , contributing to losses on stock futures across the board .
At Thursday ’s close , the stock had risen 70 percent since early March , on hopes that Windows 7 system will be a hit and a positive reaction to its new Bing search engine .
For many years , nuts have gotten a bad rap for being high in fat .
But in reality , nuts should be a vital part of our diet , as they are high in monounsaturated fats that help keep us heart - healthy and disease - free .
Healthy nuts are also great sources of protein , minerals , and other life - enhancing nutrients .
Scientific studies now show that different types of nuts and seeds may support factors that help prevent heart disease , weight gain and the accumulation of LDL cholesterol .
All nuts should be organic , eaten in their raw state , and not irradiated or roasted .
In no particular order , here is my list of the five healthiest nuts you should add to your diet .
The Top Healthiest Nuts Length : 2 minutes
Top Healthiest Nuts
1. Almonds
A small handful of almonds gives you almost 25 % of your daily needs for magnesium , and more bone - strengthening calcium as an equal amount of cow milk .
They are also high in many antioxidants , such as vitamin E and selenium .
Studies show that almonds may play an important role in preventing colon cancer due to their high fiber content .
Almonds also help lower negative forms of cholesterol in the bloodstream .
2. Walnuts
One of the best nuts on earth , walnuts may support your brain function .
Studies show that consumption of walnuts is related to heart - health , better cognitive function , as well as the reduction of skin and bone conditions .
Packed full of an antioxidant known as ellagic acid , researchers have shown that walnuts contain 16 disease - fighting polyphenols .
3. Pecans
Recent clinical studies show that pecans significantly lower cholesterol .
Pecans are also a great source of over twenty essential vitamins and minerals .
4. Brazil Nuts
High in heart - healthy nutrients and minerals like copper , niacin , vitamin E , fiber , magnesium , and selenium , studies on Brazil nuts show that they are a protein - packed snack that may aid in the prevention of breast cancer .
5. Cedar Nuts
Siberian cedar nuts , originating in Russia , hold 70 % of the essential amino acids your body needs .
They also contain high amounts of vitamins A , B , and D , and tocopherol - containing vitamin E .
This exotic nut also contains a fatty acid similar to fish oil , which is known for reducing the amount of LDL cholesterol , keeping the arterial walls free of disease - causing inflammation and plaque .
Raw nuts are a big part of my diet and pack more energy than any other food .
They make a healthy snack that is low in calories and can be a great addition to your diet .

The UK Pirate Party has been officially registered at the Electoral Commission and is hoping to follow in the footsteps of its successful counterpart in Sweden .
With all the recent controversy surrounding anti-piracy legislation and lawyers going after alleged file - sharers , the party has become necessity .
In June the Swedish Pirate Party shocked its critics and secured a seat in the European Parliament , with no less than 7.1 percent of the vote .
The Pirates received more votes from those under 30 than any other party in Sweden , which went beyond all expectations .
This achievement motivated supporters of the Party ’s ideals in other countries to become active as well .
Last month the Swiss Pirate Party was founded and the Canadians are mobilizing too .
In the UK the local Pirate Party has n’t been sitting still either , quite the opposite .
Today the Pirate Party UK announced that they are officially registered at the Electoral Commission .
The paperwork is done and all the bureaucracy has been dealt with , so now the party ’s biggest challenge is to increase its membership .
“ Now the party can really start .
It ’s time for us to tell the world that we exist , to recruit members , raise funds and gear up to fight the General Election , ” Pirate Party Chairman , Andrew Robinson told TorrentFreak .
“ The officers and web team have built the framework that the party needs to get going , now it ’s time for the public to make things happen , ” he added .
Increasingly the UK copyright lobby is pushing politicians , ISPs and law enforcement to take action against those accused of copyright infringement .
If anywhere , a Party devoted to protecting online privacy and weeding out copyright abuse is much needed in Britain .
However , they ca n’t do much without the help of actively involved members .
“ Join the party , tell the media about the party , tell your friends about the party , take part in policy and news debates on the forum , join our Facebook group , donate or set up a regular payment to provide financial support , set up a branch in your constituency , school or workplace , ” Robinson suggests , emphasizing that the success of Britain ’s newest party depends on its members .
All over the world the Pirate Party movement is growing , with new parties being founded every month .
For those who want to get involved locally , a full list of all the parties can be found at Pirate Party International .

According to the Campaign Against Marijuana Planting , a multiagency task force managed by the state ’s Bureau of Narcotic Enforcement , this year is already one for the record books .
In more than 425 raids since late June , some 3.4 million plants have been seized , up from 2.9 million all of last year .
And , officials note , they still have roughly a month and a half before the campaign expires with the end of harvest season .
Raids occur daily , from southern counties like Riverside , where some 27,000 plants were found on July 2 , to northern ones like Lake and Shasta , in each of which more than 400,000 plants have been destroyed by the authorities this year .
( Mature plants are usually incinerated , younger ones simply uprooted . )

About 2.7 million plants , nearly 80 percent of the seized crop , have been found on federal , state or other public lands .
Officials attribute the plants ’ prevalence there to the vast area investigators are expected to cover .
“ It ’s rugged terrain , very difficult to get to and very difficult to see , ” said John Heil , a spokesman for the United States Forest Service , which in California has jurisdiction over 20.6 million acres , home to nearly 60 percent of this year ’s seizures .
Mr. Heil said drug operators could be blamed for a handful of wildfires each year in California , which is already dealing with a prolonged drought and budget - stretched firefighting resources .
Environmental damage of a different kind can also be severe , with pesticides seeping into soil and streams , and trash and human waste left behind .
Lieutenant LeGault said he was impressed by how far marijuana growers would go  deeper into forests , higher in the mountains  in an effort to avoid detection .
“ They call it a wilderness because it is , ” he said .
“ Not even the billy goats go there . ”
We have a cycling group in Gurgaon , where I live , and since we are all yatris ( travellers ) and use pedal power , we named our group Pedalyatri .
Our aim is to explore hidden treasures around Gurgaon , Faridabad and Delhi .
So , we often find ourselves scouring Google earth , looking for elusive trails over Aravalis , and then trying them out .
Nine out of 10 , our assessment of whether the route is cycleable or not is accurate .
There have been times when the trails have proven to be extremely puncture prone , so much so that on one of the rides , 14 of us ended up with over 40 punctures .
As a group , however , we enjoy it and over a period , we have become so good at fixing punctures and changing tubes that the joke amongst ourselves is that we are better at it than any cycle mechanic .
We have also been to areas of the Aravalis that have been in the news for all the wrong reasons .
It is the same area that the apex court ’s monitoring body had recently said was unauthorised and must not be developed .
We have seen in this area the name plates of super rich and super powerful , occupying virtually the entire hill top in some cases .
These include several among those we often find holding forth on various fora about what is right and wrong .
One name plate among these illegally developed parts is that of a powerful and prominent union cabinet minister in the current government .
However , despite the ability to lap it all up with a smile , we certainly were n’t prepared for a sight that hit us on one of our recent trails .
We had been reading all about how the mining mafia , in their greed , had raped the Aravalis .
These stories had often been accompanied by a picture or two .
But this was not what we expected .
What had happened that this ride of ours was turning into another puncture festival , so we decided that we would walk a few KMs to the road head , repair the tyres and then ride .
We followed the map on our GPS purposefully when we suddenly came across a giant hole in the ground .
What we saw cannot really be described in words , so I will let the photographs do the hard task , while I will attempt to add captions wherever necessary .

( The trail was thorny , and all of us had punctures so we decided to walk . )
( This is what we saw from a distance .
Still had no idea what lies ahead . )
( We were getting closer . )
( The first look into the manmade crater . )
( Look at the labyrinth of truck tracks . )
( One rider , standing at the edge , almost fell as the earth underneath caved in . )
( Once we realised there ’d be no more punctures , we sat down to repair our tyres in the middle of the mine . )
Honestly , having seen this disgraceful rape of the hill , do you think there is a way out ?
The mining has stopped , officially that is , after the apex court ’s strong intervention .
But for all practical purposes , it seems to be on paper alone .
We often ride through areas where mining is officially banned , but we still hear detonator blasts .
Not just that , since trucks are conspicuous , we have seen camels , scores of them , ferrying material being excavated from mines .
( Camels instead of trucks . )
Looking at all this , one wonders .
Where is all this greed leading to ?
When those who are supposed to lead us care two hoots , should we ?
I think we should .
It is our nation , and if they do n’t , we need to make them understand that they are doing wrong and we will not let them do this to our nation .
There is a story in today ’s Times of India that an irate motorist was so exasperated with the rule breaking hoodlum at one toll plaza that he whipped out a revolver and threatened the truant driver to behave else !
I am not the one for vigilante justice , as it will only add to the anarchical state .
But , when those we have elected to govern us turn into rulers who have no respect for laws , we wonder whether vigilante justice is such a bad thing .
TPM Reader JP ain’t happy …
We ARE getting out - hustled .
There ’s an army of us out here who want health care reform , but no one is directing us to voice our anger .
I ’m tired of writing and calling Sens. Cornyn and Hutchison and getting back boilerplate responses .
If Doggett ’s people announced another Town Hall in Austin , which tilts very left , lots of us are ready to go toe to toe with the brownshirts .
But no one ’s been calling … …

Betelgeuse Resolved
Credit : Pierre Kervella , NaCo , VLT , ESO
Explanation :
The sharpest image ever of Betelgeuse shows a mammoth star that is slowly evaporating .
Betelgeuse ( sounds a lot like " beetle juice " ) , also known as Alpha Orionis , is one of the largest and brightest stars known .
The star is a familiar orange fixture easily visible to the unaided eye toward the constellation of Orion .
This recent image from the Very Large Telescope in Chile resolves not only the face of Betelgeuse , but a large and previously unknown plume of surrounding gas .
This plume gives fresh indications of how the massive star is shedding mass as it nears the end of its life .
Conversely , a series of previous observations indicate that the surface of Betelgeuse has noticeably shrunk , on the average , over the past decade .
If Betelgeuse , a red supergiant star about 640 light years distant , were placed at the center of our Solar System , the plume would extend past the orbit of Jupiter .
Since Betelgeuse is known to change its brightness irregularly , future observations may determine if changes its appearance irregularly as well .
Betelgeuse is a candidate to undergo a spectacular supernova explosion almost anytime in the next few thousand years .

Since consciousness is the one thing that physics can't explain , we can make it a fundamental characteristic of spirit .
Then , when we die , our physical body falls away ( like the leaves on a tree fall away in Autumn ) .
There is no mathematical description of love .
Yet that is exactly what we experience when we die ( or have a near death experience ) .
When we die , all that scientific cynicism dies with the physical body ; true pure consciousness ( the ability to witness ) survives in spirit ...

Here is an easy way to organize a multi-verse .
Wave - functions exist .
Wave - functions interpenetrate every boson , fermions and space - time .
In fact , the big bang of this universe and other universes is just an expansion from this central ocean of wave - functions .
To look at it another way , wave - functions are what some people call " spirit " .
All universes that explode into existence are tied to spirit , what some people might call God .

The multiverse theory of space
read all article comments
How do you compare one infinity to another ?
Think fast :
The fate of the universe just might depend on your answer .
That may sound a little dramatic to some , but not to Alexander Vilenkin of Tufts University , Massachusetts , and Jaume Garriga of the University of Barcelona , Spain .
They believe that our universe is one of many — infinitely many .
According to " multiverse " theory , our Big Bang was just one in an eternal rumbling of bangs , each of which brings a new universe into being .
Vilenkin and Garriga want to work out how ordinary — or how unusual — the properties of our universe are when compared with its neighbors .
What fraction could harbor life , for instance ?
The trouble is that with an infinite number of universes propagating forever , " anything that can happen will happen an infinite number of times , " says Vilenkin .
The trick is weighing up these infinities .
To explain why the sums are so hard , Vilenkin poses a numerical brainteaser : " What is the relative number of even and odd integers ?
"
If you think there are just as many evens as there are odds , that ’s a good answer .
After all , one pairs up with two ; three pairs up with four ; five pairs up with six ; and so on , into infinity .
" But what if I write the numbers separately and take two odds for each even ? " he asks .
Now one is grouped with two and four ; three is grouped with six and eight ; and so on .
You could conclude that there are twice as many evens as odds , and you would n’t be wrong .
“ I can reach any conclusion I wish !
And that ’s not good , ” says Vilenkin .
Things get a little more complicated when you ’re talking about universes .
For one thing , universes do n’t come in nice neat rows like numbers .
Plus , they ’re all different : Theorists believe that the fundamental constants could be set to different values in each universe .
In Universe A , gravity could be ten times stronger than in Universe B. Meanwhile , in Universe B , atoms could be bound together only half as tightly as they are in Universe C. Theorists have been searching for a natural prescription to make these infinities somehow finite for decades , says Vilenkin .
One solution was to count infinities only up to a certain time cutoff :
At 100 billion years , say , someone rings a bell and you start tallying up the universes , ignoring any universes that crop up later .
But nothing ’s ever that easy .
Many of the cutoffs , or " measures , " that researchers examined led to logical paradoxes , and those that did n’t made predictions that were in glaring conflict with observations .
Some were plagued by the " youngness paradox , " that is , they predicted that intelligent life would be most likely to crop up close to the time of the Big Bang .
That makes our very existence , 14 billion years post - Bang , a near–impossibility .
Theorists crossed those measures off of their list .
Other measures had downright bizarre implications , predicting that " normal , " biologically –evolved human brains should be outnumbered by so–called Boltzmann brains — disembodied minds that float in space .
Boltzmann brains could be complete human beings , just brains , or maybe even silicon chips — material objects with the thinking power to " hallucinate " the universe we think of as real .
Pick the wrong measure , and poof :
You ’re a Boltzmann brain !
It might sound like crackpot cosmology , but Boltzmann brains are a serious sticking point for some measures .
Quantum mechanics tells us that things can pop up from the fluctuating vacuum .
These " things " could be as trivial as an electron–positron pair that blinks into existence and then disappears again a split–second later .
Particle physicists are well aware of this phenomenon ; it happens all the time .
Less likely , a whole atom could perform this magic trick .
Even more improbably , a whole human being — or Windsor Castle , or a Honus Wagner baseball card , or a fully –formed brain thinking exactly your thoughts — could spontaneously materialize .
"
It ’s ridiculously improbable ! " says Vilenkin .
But given an infinite amount of time , even things that are ridiculously improbable are bound to happen .
" So how do I know whether I ’m a normal person …or a vacuum fluctuation ?
" Do n’t have an identity crisis just yet .
Theorists agree that our universe must contain more " normal " brains than it does Boltzmann brains .
" The world around a typical Boltzmann brain looks very different from the world around us , " says Garriga .
Plus , a Boltzmann brain likely would n’t stick around for long , so the mere fact that we all continue to think coherent thoughts from one moment to the next should be some assurance that we ’re real .
Once measures burdened by Boltzmann brains and other paradoxes were crossed off the list of contenders , says Vilenkin , a frontrunner emerged : a measure called the scale–factor cutoff .
Rather than measuring time using some synchronized cosmic clock , the scale–factor cutoff uses the expansion of the universe as a stopwatch .
Instead of stopping the clocks and counting up universes after a certain amount of time passes , you stop after a set amount of expansion , so all regions are treated equally .
What makes the scale–factor cutoff stand out is that it seems to be the only simple cutoff that avoids paradoxes and pitfalls , says cosmologist Alan Guth , who has also studied measures Problem solved ?
Well , almost .
Not everyone agrees that the scale–factor cutoff is the best basket in which to place the universe ’s infinite eggs .
I–Sheng Yang , a graduate student at the University of California , Berkeley , is part of a team exploring an alternative measure based on a universal time cutoff .
" These two measures may have phenomenological differences , and their inventers may have different physical pictures in mind , but to me they are quite similar , " says Yang .
With so much yet to be learned about each cutoff , picking a winner " is actually quite about personal tastes , " he says .
Ideally , cosmologists would prefer to derive a measure from fundamental principles , rather than simply endorsing the measure that happens to avoid the most paradoxes or making choices based on taste .
Leaving such big questions to a process –of–elimination should only be " an exercise of last resort , " says Guth , adding that theorists are now meeting the " limitations of trying to determine the correct measure simply by what works .
" With that in mind , Vilenkin and Garriga are rebuilding their measure from the ground up , aiming for a precise version that is truly fundamental .
But where to start ?
How about with a hologram ?
There is an intriguing concept in physics , called the " holographic principle , " which says that problems that are mathematically difficult in four dimensions ( our three spatial dimensions plus a fourth dimension , time ) can be more elegantly recast in three dimensions .
By " going down a dimension , " formerly intractable problems can be reduced to " some very beautiful mathematics , " says Vilenkin .
The holographic principle offers up a lifeline , Vilenkin explains .
" Since we can not come up with a good motivation for our measure in four dimensions , maybe three dimensions will work . "
" I really do consider the work to be extremely important , " says Guth .
If they succeed , " it would be a tremendous breakthrough .
"
If Vilenkin and Garriga can derive their measure by taking the number of spatial dimensions down a notch , what exactly does that mean ?
How will their two–dimensional theory relate to our three –dimensional space ?
" This theory lives at the future boundary of spacetime , " says Garriga .
" The place where everything has been said and done .
" In that place , theorists like Vilenkin and Garriga have already considered every possibility , derived everything there is to derive , and solved the universe ’s puzzles a million times over .
But in this universe , Vilenkin and Garriga are still at their desks , paper and pencils in hand , taking it one infinity at a time .

David Laut traveled the world as an Olympic shot - put medalist , but he never forgot his roots in Oxnard .
When his glory days ended , Laut -- who earned a bronze medal at the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles -- bought a home in south Oxnard , taught in the local public schools and raised a son with his wife , Jane , his high school sweetheart .
About midnight Thursday , Laut , 52 , stepped outside his home to confront prowlers and was gunned down , according to law enforcement officials and neighbors .
Police called to the scene found him lying in the side yard of his tidy beige - and - white stucco home , dead from multiple gunshot wounds .
No arrests have been made and police have no suspects , said Oxnard Police Sgt. Ron Whitney .

The neighborhood of well - kept tract homes built in the 1980s is about two miles from the beach , and police rarely are called there for violent crime , Whitney said .
“ I consider it a good area of town , ” the police sergeant said .
Neighbors and colleagues on Friday were reeling at the news that Laut , a 6 - foot - 3 “ gentle giant , ” had been taken from them .
“ It was an honor to know him , ” said Carter Laurie , Laut ’s next - door neighbor , wiping away tears .
“ He was a local boy who did well and came back to share his talents with the community . ”

Laurie said he had gone to bed early with a cold .
But his wife heard three shots about midnight .
The couple dismissed the disturbance as firecrackers until police arrived a few minutes later , Laurie said .
Laut had insisted that his wife stay inside while he checked on some noise in the yard , Laurie said he was told by Laut ’s mother - in - law .
Laut ’s wife “ heard him say , ‘ What the hell are you doing here ? ’ and then she heard ‘ bang , bang , bang , ’ ” Laurie said .
Laut was athletic director at nearby Hueneme High School , a post he took a year ago , said Principal Adrian Palazuelos .
Before that , he served for eight years as track coach at Hueneme High , and then left for one year to take a coaching job at a school in Ventura .

Laut ’s late father was a longtime science teacher at Hueneme High , Palazuelos said .
“ His roots to south Oxnard and Hueneme go back fairly deep , ” Palazuelos said .
Laut had spent several hours on campus Thursday helping arrange sports physicals for students who would be starting classes next week , the principal said , adding that Laut was well liked by students and staff .
“ He was a gentle giant , compassionate and student - focused , ” Palazuelos said .
“ And he was a competitor like no other . ”

Born in Ohio but reared in Ventura County , Laut played football , basketball and baseball at Santa Clara High School .
But he excelled most at the shot put , winning two NCAA titles at UCLA .
He won a gold medal at the 1979 Pan American Games and picked up the bronze medal at the Coliseum .
Jim Kiefer , Laut ’s throwing coach at UCLA , called him a wonderful guy with a great sense of humor .
At one Pac - 10 conference meet , Laut put the shot in the finals and walked out of the ring , thinking it was a poor effort .
In fact , it was a winning distance , but he fouled by walking out of the ring .
Kiefer warned him not to do that again .
Advertisement
“ Then , he won the NCAA title and he ran over to me and he picked me up and had me over his head and I weighed 220 pounds .
He just said , ‘ Wow , ’ ” Kiefer recalled .
“ I remember what I said too .
I said , ‘ Put me down . ’ ”
Laut worked out every day in his garage , which he had converted into a gym , Laurie and other neighbors said .
He was modest about his past sports accomplishments , said neighbor Chet Thomas .
“ I never knew he was a medalist until somebody told me , ” Thomas said .
“ He never changed . ”

Times staff writer Bill Dwyre contributed to this report .
An advertising boycott against Fox News host Glenn Beck has succeeded in keeping most major sponsors from running commercials on his show even as the controversial commentator 's viewership has grown .
Beck attracted 2.81 million viewers Monday , his third - largest audience since his show launched on Fox News in January , according to Nielsen Media Research data provided by the network .
On Tuesday , nearly 2.7 million viewers tuned in , his fifth - largest viewership to date .
And the conservative host got a plug from former vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin , who urged people to watch his program in a post on her Facebook page .
“ FOX News ' Glenn Beck is doing an extraordinary job this week walking America behind the scenes of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue and outlining who is actually running the White House , ” she wrote Wednesday to her 800,000 - plus supporters .
Color of Change , an African American political advocacy group , organized the boycott last month to protest Beck ’s comment that he believes President Obama is a racist .
The group succeeded in securing commitments from at least 36 companies that have pledged not to advertise on his show , including Wal - Mart and Sprint .
Some , such as AT&T and Procter & Gamble , were not Beck advertisers to begin with , but their ads had mistakenly appeared on the program .
Representatives from those companies reiterated their request not to have spots during his show .
Later today , Color of Change plans to announce six more companies that also are declining to be Beck advertisers .
As a result , few major businesses remain as sponsors of Beck ’s eponymous 2 p.m. PDT program .
On Wednesday , the only big companies with a presence during his show were Bank of America and the Wall Street Journal , whose parent company News Corp. also owns Fox News .
The rest of the commercials included spots for gold seller Rosland Capital ; Ashley Furniture Home Store ; Empire Carpet ; Liberty Medical , a diabetes medical supplier ; Johnson Law Group , an asbestos litigation firm ; “ Shadow Government , ” a new book critical of Obama published by the National Republican Trust ; and the anti-tax group TeaPartyExpress.org .
Fox News insists that the boycott has not affected its revenue , because advertisers have just moved their commercials to different time periods .
And for his part , Beck appears invigorated by the challenge .
“ Even if the powers to be right now succeed in making me poor , drum me out … I will only be stronger for it , ” he said on the air Wednesday .
“ And I will use American ingenuity and my ingenuity to pull myself up , and I will find another way to get this message out , on a platform that will be a thousand times more powerful .
Because of my faith , I know how this story ends .
The truth will set you free . ”
Since returning from a weeklong vacation Monday , Beck has not explicitly addressed the boycott .
Instead , he has launched a weeklong series called “ Reasonable Questions for an Unreasonable Time , ” in which he has argued vehemently that the Obama administration is being infiltrated by radicals seeking to undermine the U.S. Constitution .
“ I have demonstrated that these radicals are not only instrumental in shaping legislation that is being jammed through at light speed , they are also by invitation personally advising the president of the United States , ” he said Wednesday , calling them “ radical wolves that are about to devour our republic . ”
One of his most frequent targets is Van Jones , special advisor for Green Jobs , Enterprise and Innovation at the White House Council on Environmental Quality .
In 2005 , Jones co-founded Color of Change with James Rucker , the group ’s executive director .
Beck supporters have charged that Color of Change launched the boycott of Beck 's show in retaliation for the host 's criticism of Jones .
Rucker said Jones has not been associated with the group for more than a year and had nothing to do with the boycott .
" I did n’t even know Van had been a subject of Glenn Beck ’s sustained attacks until after we had launched the campaign , " he said .
" I can say absolutely there was no involvement by Van or the White House .
Beck has made these claims that are not fact - based and he needs to change the subject , and that ’s what this is all about . "
Beck began railing against Jones earlier this summer , dubbing him one of 32 “ czars ” with unchecked power in the Obama administration .
He has repeatedly called him a communist , citing a 2005 profile of Jones in the East Bay Express that described Jones ’ shift from a radical - activist past to more mainstream politics .
On Wednesday , he made reference to the fact that Jones named his son after African guerrilla leader Amilcar Cabral .
“ Should you have a communist , self - avowed revolutionary who named his 4 - year - old son after a Marxist guerrilla leader , should that person be advising the president of the United States ? ” he asked .
Jones did not immediately respond to a request for comment made through the White House .
Earlier in the week , White House spokeswoman Christine Glunz said in a statement that Jones has been lauded as an environmental hero and that his entire focus at the Council on Environmental Quality is on “ building clean - energy incentives which create 21st century jobs . ”
[ Updated at 1:33 p.m. : According to Color of Change , 10 more companies that have recently had ads air during Beck 's program have pledged not to run any further advertising on his show .
The latest businesses to distance themselves from the Fox News host include Applebee's , Bank of America , Bell & Howell , DirecTV , General Mills , Kraft , Regions Financial Corp. , SAM ( Store and Move ) , Travelers Insurance and Vonage .
Bank of America , which had a spot on Beck 's program Wednesday , pointed the group to a statement it gave Media Matters for America stating that its advertising had been placed on the program in error .
Travelers Insurance , Bell & Howell , General Mills and DirectTV also told Color of Change that they had already placed Beck 's program on their " do not air " lists and any commercials that appeared during his show were in error .
Applebee 's told the group that it was now dropping Beck 's program , and Kraft said it had decided to stop advertising " on the more politically extreme programs on all networks . " ]
[ Updated at 2:15 p.m . : According to a Fox News spokeswoman , the network has not run Bank of America ads during Beck 's show , so any spot for the bank that aired during his program would have been a local cable purchase .
In addition , the network said that Bell & Howell and SAM ( Store and Move ) were never Fox News advertisers . ]
[ Updated at 3 p.m. : SAM ( Store and Move ) is indeed a Fox News advertiser , a network spokeswoman clarifies .
The company buys ads under the name Unigroup . ]
[ Updated at 4:43 p.m. : Beck posted his second - highest viewership ever Wednesday , attracting more than 3 million viewers for the hour . ]
[ Updated at 8:07 a.m. , Aug. 28 : Ashley Furniture HomeStore pulled its advertising from " Glenn Beck " as of Thursday , said Kendra Maggert , a spokeswoman for the company . ]

Those of you upset with Apple 's rejection of the Google Voice iPhone app and the implications of such shady behavior might be interested to hear that the FCC has opened an inquiry into the ban .
In letters sent late Friday to the two companies and AT&T Inc. , the FCC asked why Apple rejected the Google Voice application for the iPhone and removed related applications from its App Store .
The letter also seeks information on how AT&T , the exclusive U.S. iPhone carrier , was consulted in the decision , if at all .

Secretary of State Says US or " Some Other Enemy " May Launch First Strike Against Iran
Citing the disastrous 2003 US invasion of Iraq as an example , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton today warned that by continuing to refuse to abandon its civilian nuclear program , Iran was risking the possibility of an invasion by the US or “ some other enemy that would do that to them . ”
The comments came during an interview on ABC ’s “ This Week ” program , and when asked by interviewer and former Clinton - era official George Stephanopoulus , Secretary Clinton reiterated “ that ’s right , as a first strike . ”
The bulk of the interview emphasized US opposition to the Iranian program , along with unquestioned claims that the nation was pursuing nuclear weapons .
Secretary Clinton also extended the American nuclear umbrella over Israel in the event that Iran attacked them .
Considering it was no more than 72 hours ago that President Obama made his historic call for a “ new beginning ” to US relations with the Muslim world , it seems incredible that his administration is already raising the prospect of an Iraq - style invasion of Iran .
Already six years in , the Iraq occupation has killed thousands of US soldiers , sucked trillions from the American economy , and is stretching the military to its limits .
It is unfathomable that with this war still far from over , the Obama Administration is considering an Iraq redux in its larger neighbor to the east .
Big tattooed stupid Kimberly Vlaminck had previously said she ' fell asleep ' in a tattooist 's chair and then mistakenly received 56 tattoos instead of the original 3 she wanted later admitted she lied .
She in fact asked for the 56 stars on her face .
She fibbed to escape the wrath of her father .
We 're not sure what made her look dumber , the lie she gave to the world , or the lame stars on her face .

The Gulls : A Gull in the Head is Truly Priceless !
What happened , Mitch ?
Gull hit her .
A gull ?
WTF on earth is this dang thing here anyway ??!
Well , “ The Gulls ” is a 1 - min. animated short film created by Kristof Luyckx .
This very strange , drolly witty animated short was inspired by a piece of dialogue from Alfred Hitchcock ’s “ The Birds . ”
Yes indeedy , and this poor little lady here in this film is n’t wearing no fancy - fashion birdie hat .
Nope , she ’s got herself a gull sticking right into her head , and it ’s a truly priceless wonder to see !

As expected , Microsoft and Yahoo have finally struck a deal , one that with regulatory approval , they hope will be in place by early 2010 .
Microsoft has issued a press release and created a minisite about the deal .
A press conference is happening later today ( which we ’ll live blog ) , and we ’ll have continuing coverage .
The details so far :
The term of the agreement is 10 years
Microsoft will acquire an exclusive 10 year license to Yahoo ! ’s core search technologies , and Microsoft will have the ability to integrate Yahoo !
search technologies into its existing web search platforms [ Note from Danny Sullivan : Exclusive suggests
Yahoo itself wo n’t be able to use the technology or develop it , which means after 10 years , what ’s left probably is n’t that useful ]
Microsoft ’s Bing will be the exclusive algorithmic search and paid search platform for Yahoo ! sites .
Yahoo !
will continue to use its technology and data in other areas of its business such as enhancing display advertising technology .
Yahoo ! will become the exclusive worldwide relationship sales force for both companies ’ premium search advertisers .
Self - serve advertising for both companies will be fulfilled by Microsoft ’s AdCenter platform , and prices for all search ads will continue to be set by AdCenter ’s automated auction process .
Each company will maintain its own separate display advertising business and sales force .
Yahoo ! will innovate and “ own ” the user experience on Yahoo !
properties , including the user experience for search , even though it will be powered by Microsoft technology .
[ Note from Danny : AOL used similar words about how it would somehow make Google - powered search “ better ” despite not owning the technology .
People still went to Google ] .
Microsoft will compensate Yahoo !
through a revenue sharing agreement on traffic generated on Yahoo ! ’s network of both owned and operated ( O&O ) and affiliate sites .
Microsoft will pay traffic acquisition costs ( TAC ) to Yahoo !
at an initial rate of 88 % of search revenue generated on Yahoo ! ’s O&O sites during the first 5 years of the agreement .
Yahoo ! will continue to syndicate its existing search affiliate partnerships .
Microsoft will guarantee Yahoo ! ’s O&O revenue per search ( RPS ) in each country for the first 18 months following initial implementation in that country .
[ Note from Danny :
What ’s the amount ?
And this is far shorter than I ’d have expected ] .
At full implementation ( expected to occur within 24 months following regulatory approval ) , Yahoo !
estimates , based on current levels of revenue and current operating expenses , that this agreement will provide a benefit to annual GAAP operating income of approximately $ 500 million and capital expenditure savings of approximately $ 200 million .
Yahoo !
also estimates that this agreement will provide a benefit to annual operating cash flow of approximately $ 275 million .
The agreement protects consumer privacy by limiting the data shared between the companies to the minimum necessary to operate and improve the combined search platform , and restricts the use of search data shared between the companies .
The agreement maintains the industry - leading privacy practices that each company follows today .

Now THIS is something I ’ve been waiting to share with you .
I ’m making a game !
… a retro remake .
And since “ 1988 ’s most over the top game ” is the subject of an incredibly detailed new feature in this month ’s Retro Gamer magazine , now is the PERFECT time to tell you all about it .
Welcome , to Day 1 of “ International Operation Block Week ” .
Each day ( Monday to Friday ) I ’ll have a little bit more for you . 🙂
But first , a little history …
I started development of Operation Block in early 2006 , as an entry in that year ’s Retro Remakes competition .
At the time , I was just learning the Game Maker program , and wanted a game remake :
Of a game I loved
From a genre that had n’t been remade much before
That could have accessable controls added , for gamers with a disability *
* Retro Remakes competitions encourage this .
Very early in the piece , I decided that Taito ’s 1988 classic Operation Wolf was the game I ’d remake .
But my lack of graphical prowess would be a big problem , unless I worked out a clever solution .
Plan A was to film / photograph friends in army gear , on location , in the style of Operation Wolf 3 ( or the Terminator 2 gun game ) .
I ’d then edit Creative Commons licensed photographs to create the backdrops .
Of course , doing the former would require movie - style equipment , lighting and makeup … so plan A was abandoned .
At the time , I ’d been playing with the ( then freeware beta ) of the Lego - esque online game Blockland .
It allowed you to explore & build in 3D using Lego - esque characters and building blocks .
This would be a clever way to get around my inability to pixel !
Plan B : Build & photograph ( screenshot ) the characters , vehicles and “ sets ” within Blockland .
I went as far as building a few of level 1 ’s buildings before realising that my ability to customise or animate the characters would be limited .
Also – the “ filming ” would require another person to “ flim ” the characters Machinema - style .
As I wanted to work solo , this was no good .
( BTW : Take note of the upper right building below … you ’ll see why in a minute . )
I liked the idea of using Lego characters , as I thought they looked charming .
I googled for any other programs that might help me .
It was then that I found the answer !
Ldraw .
It ’s a collection of free software tools for modeling Lego creations in 3D .
Plan C : Use LDraw & the associated programs that interface with it .
The LDraw parts library is amazing .
It ’s got virtually every piece of “ real ” Lego you ’ve ever seen , and plenty more you have n’t .
Due to the incredibly flexibility of this system – plan C was the winner .
The steps to create Lego objects for Operation Block are :
Assemble the pieces in MLCad .
Place lights around the model in L3P .
Render the model in Povray .
You can see below a screenshot of MlCad in action , using the Ldraw parts to design a “ green grenade thrower ” enemy …
Now , remember that building with the red / brown roof I showed earlier ?
( It ’s the “ top right ” picture in the “ group of 6 ” . )
OK , here ’s my version of it …
I think that looks pretty good .
And there ’s plenty more where that came from .
( Soldiers , vehicles , etc )
Now – I had a programming environment , and a way to make the graphics .
And over the next 120 days , I managed to :
Analyse the original Operation Block to within an inch of its life Learn how to use MlCad , L3P & Povray for models Use GIMP layers for animation Program in Gamemaker Remove 99 % of the bugs in my programming
But I only had level 1 completed .
Levels 2 to 6 were just in the planning stages .
And as the RR competition required games to be “ at least 80 % complete ” , I simply could n’t enter .
I did a bit more work on Operation Block over the next 12 months , but by mid 2007 , the project was resting .
There it sat , on my external drive .
Until now .
Operation Block is a freeware , fan tribute game being developed for Windows PCs .
There ’s no connection whatsoever to Taito , Lego or Traveller ’s Tales .
And it wo n’t be ready till Christmas 2010 .
At the earliest .
Hope you enjoyed Day 1 of “ International Operation Block Week ” .
… well , I ca n’t give away everything at once . 😉
PS : If you ’re excited by Operation Block , please consider giving it a “ digg ” or a “ reddit “ .
Thanks !

Mother , Should I Trust the Government ?
Let ’s start by getting a few things out of the way .
I think the birthers are nuts , and the “ death panel ” nonsense is just that –nonsense on stilts .
I ’ve got no use at all for the Palin / Joe the Plumber / teabagger wing of the GOP .
I ’m alarmed by said wing ’s tendencies toward brownshirtism ( as chronicled by David Neiwert among others ) , and the astroturf mobs organized by insurance industry stooges like Dick Armey and Rick Scott to disrupt town hall meetings .
And as strongly as I believe in the right to keep and bear arms , I think anyone who shows up at a public appearance by the President packing heat is probably missing some attic insulation .
All that being said , Keith Olbermann has really gone over the top with his sanctimonious attacks on “ conspiracy theorists ” and people who “ actually fear their own government . ”
I get the impression he would n’t think much more of Noam Chomsky ’s view of the world , or Howard Zinn ’s , than he does of the right - wingers ’ .
Olbmermann ’s view of the world does n’t have much room for anything but plain old vanilla - flavored managerial liberalism .
I suppose if you broke down Olbermann ’s view of the question for analysis , it would probably go something like this :
Sure , horrible things happened under Bush and his minions , but they were aberrations .
They did not result from the inherent nature of government , and anyone who suggests otherwise is a nutcase .
The solution is simply to put the right people in control of government , so government can perform its default function as a progressive instrument for “ all of us working together . ”
In soccer mom parlance , the good guys , the “ working families who sit around the kitchen table , ” are also the people who “ play by the rules . ”
And “ the rules , ” a la “ Why Mommy is a Democrat , ” are just the sensible way that “ all of us , working together , ” come up with to make the system work in “ everybody ’s interest ” with a minimum of muss and fuss .
But if you look at the actual history of the state , the “ right people ” were apparently never in charge .
As I pointed out in an earlier commentary piece at C4SS , “ The Democrats : Fake Party of Compassion , ” the Democrats have fully lived up to Nader ’s characterization of them : just the “ liberal ” head of the two - headed corporate party .
All the so - called “ progressive ” regulatory and welfare state policies created under the “ Good Presidents ” were made pursuant to government ’s function as ( if you ’ll pardon the phrase ) executive committee of the corporate capitalist ruling class .
The stability of corporate capitalism , the need for predictable profits and stable markets , the need to counteract destabilizing tendencies toward overinvestment and underconsumption , have always been front and center in the consciousness of policymaking elites .
That was the theme of Teddy Roosevelt ’s “ Progressive ” regulatory state , as recounted by Gabriel Kolko , and of FDR ’s New Deal as described by G.William Domhoff .
The Social Democratic or New Deal wing of those policymaking elites , in particular , have paid more attention to avoiding destabilizing polarization of wealth and income , and maintaining high levels of employment .
But the key economic policymaking roles , in Democratic administrations as well as Republican , have been held by corporate executives , corporate lawyers , and investment bankers .
Ever hear of Bob Rubin or Tim Geithner ?
Yeah , a real bunch of fire - eating anticapitalists we got there .
That ’s one reason I hold such contempt for “ Joe the Plumber ” and his screaming ignoramuses : anyone who can seriously look at Obama ’s economic team and its policies , and suspect him of being a closet “ Marxist , ” probably should n’t be allowed to use scissors without adult supervision .
Do n’t get me wrong .
If my only choices are between two kinds of statism , I ’ll take the one that weighs less heavily on my own neck .
If my only choices are between a German - style SocDem regime and the kind of right - to - work sweatshop that Tom DeLay and Jack Abramoff set up in the Marianas Islands , I ’ll take the former in a heartbeat .
But both models are run primarily in the interests of big business .
To repeat an old illustration I never tire of trotting out , the Democrats are like a farmer who thinks it ’s more profitable in the long run to feed and house his livestock decently and work them in moderation , while the Republicans are like a farmer who thinks he ’ll come out ahead working them to death and replacing them .
If you ’re going to be a plowhorse , it ’s better to be owned by a Democrat–but they both clearly think of us as their livestock .
Me , I ’d rather the farm be run by the animals ( minus the pigs , of course ) .
My main objection to “ conspiracy theorists , ” of the Schlafly / Smoot / Bircher type , is the weakness of their explanatory framework .
To someone in Hofstadter ’s “ paranoid style of American politics , ” all the nefarious acts of those running the state are motivated by personal cliques and ideological cabals : the Illuminati , Obama ’s secret Marxism or Islamism , the lizard people , the Royals vs. the Vatican , the Rothschilds and Rockefellers , etc .
In reality , most of the horrible things government does do n’t require a conspiracy , or secret meetings at the Nazi Saucer Base inside the Hollow Earth , invoking Adam Weisshaupt and the eye in the pyramid .
They follow of necessity from the institutional and class structures into which our world is organized .
To be sure , contra Olbermann , there have been conspiracies ; they are , in fact , fairly common .
Hitler used SS provocateurs , in Polish uniforms , to harass ethnic Germans in Danzig and create a pretext for war ( and anyone who does n’t think American mainstream journalists would have reported the official story as straight news , in the same situation , must not have followed CNN coverage of the incident between Russia and Georgia last August ) .
If the people who accuse FDR of “ foreknowledge ” of Pearl Harbor have overreached themselves , there is nevertheless a preponderance of evidence that he was trying to goad the Japanese into firing the first shot and providing a pretext for war , and that his primary motivation was to secure American corporate control of the resources and markets disappearing into the Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere .
It was his intention to initiate war with Japan , if necessary , if the Empire took over the oilfields of the Dutch East Indies .
Since then , we ’ve had a CIA - engineered coup in Saigon to replace Diem with someone who would acquiesce to an American invasion of South Vietnam , and a fake “ incident ” in the Gulf of Tonkin to provide the pretext for such an invasion .
We ’ve had Bush I encouraging Kuwaiti slanted drilling on the Iraqi border , April Glaspie ’s assurances to Saddam that the U.S. took no interest in inter-Arab conflicts , and official lies about Kuwaiti incubator babies and massed Iraqi armor on the Saudi border .
We ’ve had massaged intelligence under Bush II to lie the country into another war with Iraq , clearly motivated by a “ Great Game ” with Russia for strategic control of the Persian Gulf and Caspian oil basins .
If anything , the centralized , bureaucratic structure of the corporate state promotes conspiracies as a side - effect .
When three or four county commissioners meet informally at a barbecue in violation of FOI laws , and discuss using county equipment to pave the county executive ’s private access road , it does n’t take a crazy “ conspiracy theorist ” to believe it happens .
Considering the tightness of the good ol ’ boy networks that control most local governments , it ’s almost remarkable when it does n’t happen .
Likewise , when society is controlled by a few hundred oligopoly corporations , a bunch of centralized government agencies , and a dozen giant media corporations , all united in an interlocking directorate with the same few thousand people shuffling constantly back and forth in a revolving door of leadership–well , of course conspiracies happen .
But the remarkable thing is just how unnecessary conspiracies are : they ’re just icing on the cake .
The crimes of the corporate state , over the past century or so , have been overwhelmingly carried out , not by Snidely Whiplashes chortling with glee and twirling their moustaches , but by bureaucratic functionaries acting in sincere good faith that their policies were objectively required for the “ public good . ”
Such people spend their entire careers dutifully shuffling papers from their in - box to their out - box , ordering the deaths of millions in the process , without ever suspecting that what ’s good for GM really might not be good for America .
A world dominated by a few hundred corporations wedded to the centralized state is the only , natural , and inevitable way of doing things .
And any kind of “ radicalism ” that offers an alternative to that natural way of doing things must be nipped in the bud .
Most of the great evils carried out by the American state over the past century would have been carried out by such people without any conspiracies , with absolutely no guilt or shame , in full confidence that it was warranted by the objective requirements of the situation in light of their duties to the “ common good . ”
But make no mistake : the kind of world maintained and run by these “ little Eichmanns ” is , indeed , evil .
Mass - murder has been very much a bipartisan policy of the American state .
It ’s almost comical to see retired CIA officers appearing as pet liberals on Olbermann and Maddow , solemnly reassuring viewers that the CIA absolutely never did things like waterboarding before 9 - 11 , because it was “ clearly illegal . ”
Good God , have you people never heard of Philip Fucking Agee ?!!
Maybe people with official GS ratings and paychecks from Langley never directly pulled any fingernails , true enough .
But God knows enough fingernails were pulled and enough people waterboarded by monsters put in power by the CIA , or trained by the Green Berets or School of the Americas .
There are the hundreds of thousands killed by Suharto ( the Jarkarta station chief helpfully compiled a roundup list for the Indonesian military ) and by Mobutu .
And the reason : the sensible realists in American policy circles , with no malice aforethought , considered a rational world order managed by giant corporations to be in the general interest for long - term prosperity .
A world in which the giant corporations had to buy oil on terms set by Sukarno , or copper and uranium on terms set by Lumumba , was simply unthinkable to them .
In Guatemala , the sensible realists found it similarly intolerable for Arbenz to give the land to its rightful owners to the detriment of UFC .
Since he was overthrown in 1953 , hundreds of thousands of people have been massacred by military governments and death squads in Guatemala alone .
In Central America as a whole , the death toll from death squads fighting to protect the region ’s landed oligarchs extends into the millions .
The entire continent of South America , in the 1960s and 1970s , was swept by a series of CIA - assisted military coups ( just Google “ Kissinger ” and “ Operation Condor ” ) .
The CIA may ( or may not ) have assisted with the torture , but God alone knows how many people were mutilated , murdered and disappeared in basement dungeons run by people the CIA put in power .
You want ample ground to “ fear your own government ” ?
All you have to do is Google “ Palmer Raids , ” “ COINTELPRO , ” “ McCarran Internal Security Act , ” or “ Garden Plot . ”
Or read up on the history of federal strikebreaking in the Pullman Strike , the copper wars and coal wars , and even under–yes , gasp , him–good ol ’ liberal Harry Truman .
The cosmic microwave background radiation has provided scientists with some of the best data on the earliest days of the universe .
Cosmologists may have worked out how to learn even more , involving a painstaking search for the universe 's oldest helium .

The cosmic microwave background radiation , or CMBR , is a relic of a time before the advent of stable atoms , where photons bounced between electrically charged protons and electrons , lending the early universe a fog - like glow .
Roughly 400,000 years after the Big Bang , the universe had cooled enough for the electrons and protons to bond together into hydrogen atoms , canceling out their electric charges .
The photons thus stopped their chaotic zigzagging , instead spreading out in roughly straight lines .
These photons are what we now observe as the CMBR .
This phenomenon has allowed cosmologists to gather vital data regarding the formation of hydrogen in the universe .
This was a chaotic process of recombination that took millions of years ( the 400,000 year figure mentioned above is really just a rough indicator of when the process began ) to fully resolve itself , as photons smashed apart many of the emergent hydrogen atoms .
It was only as the universe expanded further that the atoms really had enough room to decisively come together , paving the way for a cosmos of matter , stars , and , ultimately , life .

Although the CMBR has been extraordinarily useful in revealing the history of the universe - after all , everything since the 400,000 year mark covers roughly 99.997 % of all time - it seemingly blocks much investigation of the time before that and the kinds of processes that might have taken place , including the decay of exotic particles .
But now scientists have figured out a way to peer even further back into the ancient cosmos by taking advantage of the other element besides hydrogen that formed in the primordial chaos .
Helium , being the heavier of the two elements , had double the electric charge of hydrogen in their nuclei and thus more quickly attracted the electrons needed to form stable atoms .
Cosmologists have pegged the time of first attraction between helium nuclei and electrons at about 15,000 years after the Big Bang , with the second electrons needed to complete the atom being brought at around the 100,000 year mark .
Both of these events took place significantly before the release of the CMBR , and the photons that interacted with these helium atoms will look significantly different from those that interacted with hydrogen .
Unfortunately , there are roughly a billion times the photons emitted by hydrogen as there are those emitted by helium , making them exceedingly difficult to find unless specifically looking for them .
Still , the helium photons do bunch together at certain frequencies , meaning photon spikes at certain frequencies in the CMBR are a telltale sign .
Once located , these helium photons will hopefully provide a window into an even earlier period of the universe 's history than previously thought possible .
Searching for these photon spikes is probably years away , however .
In order to locate these photon spikes , a satellite investigating the CMBR would have to scan frequencies from a fixed position .
The European Space Agency 's Planck Satellite , launched this past May , is currently charged with investigating the spatial patterns of the CMBR .
This requires precisely the opposite approach , as Planck scans positions from a fixed frequency .
As such , the hunt for helium photons will likely have to wait .

An open - cut coalmine in the Hunter Valley , NSW , Australia .
Graham Brown is a retired coalminer and a climate change activist .
He ’s also a member of the Upper Hunter branch of the NSW Greens party .
The Hunter Valley , near the city of Newcastle , is a major source of Australia 's coal exports .
Brown is helping build a union and community alliance to create a “ just transition ” to a carbon - neutral economy .
Such a transition would ensure workers in the coal industry move into alternative employment .
Socialist Alliance 's Zane Alcorn spoke to Brown .
How important is public ownership of electricity generation in a transition to a carbon - neutral economy ?
It is definitely of the first importance .
A private company is out to make a profit .
When that profit starts to drop , it ’ll move away .
There ’s no commitment to the community .
Public ownership is the reverse of that .
It will enable the transition to carry through from start to finish .
But it ’s not going to finish , it ’s going to be ongoing .
Retrofitting power stations is a first step , but down the track , the best thing about renewable energy is that it is decentralised , and it will be owned by the public .
Each community will have its own power generators .
There is a movie called Five Factories , about Venezuela .
In one of the factories , the government provided a loan to set up the factory .
The idea was the loan would then be paid off so the workers owned the factory .
Can you see a similar model working for funding renewable energy in Australia — a “ green stimulus package ” ?
Yes , a transition from government owned to community owned is the way to go .
It provides a ready pool of money to kick it off , because a lot of small towns do n’t have the money to spend on a big turbine , or a solar thermal setup , or photovoltaics .
Then as the payback progresses , the system provides energy - efficient appliances through the excess capital that ’s being generated by paying it back .
So [ at a community level ] we not only start to generate electricity , we also start to make better use of it .
So all those efficient products could also be part of a transition plan ?
For sure .
All of the energy - efficient stuff is part of the transition phase .
There ’s no reason it ca n’t be done as part of a recondition process .
If we ’re serious about cutting our carbon footprint , recycling is a big part of that .
We should n’t be scrapping perfectly good fridges and televisions if they can be retrofitted .
Lighting is a different matter , but even there , the silicon [ from LED lights ] can be recycled .
Do you think workers in coal - fired power and associated mineworkers would support a transition plan ?
What are the main concerns that workers in these industries would want addressed ?
Mainly it ’s on the coal side of it .
The power stations already have an example of a prototype retrofit at Liddell [ a power station in the Hunter Valley ] .
They know the benefits of it .
They know that they ’re not going to lose their jobs .
The big one of course is the coal industry .
They say to me “ you give me a job [ in renewables ] , with the same amount of money , and I ’ll take it tomorrow ” .
Well , that ’s probably not going to happen .
One of the reasons is that they work a lot longer hours than the power station workers do .
Their [ good ] money comes from longer hours , not higher pay .
Where a power station worker does a 35 - hour week , a typical mine worker works 52.5 hours a week .
Fifty per cent of his pay is topped up with a shift allowance .
That will have to be addressed , and it ’s a culture change that will cause that , not necessarily something the transition can do .
When I started in the industry , everyone had a 35 - hour week , and was quite happy with it .
Now we ’ve been forced into a 12 - hour shift , and people have forgotten what it was like to have a life .
It wo n’t take long for them to pick that back up .
So there are other miners who know the environmental impacts of the industry and are interested in a just transition ?
The people I speak to are by no means “ green thinkers ” , but they know there is a problem , and they wonder how they fit into it .
However , as the transition progresses they would move from mine to mine as the old mines close and old miners retire .
Also the amount of remediation work on the mine sites will go on for many years after the last mine stops working .
Wage rates may fluctuate in this time and will need to be kept at least the average for similar construction awards .
And miners may well retire in this phase of the transition .
Newcastle exports about A$ 10 billion worth of coal a year .
How much of that do you think is going to wages ?
We do n’t really have to replace that full $ 10 billion of exports to provide equivalent wages to workers do we ?
Well for a start I would dispute that $ 10 billion is a real figure .
[ The coal industry ] gets that amount of money by multiplying the tonnage through the port by the average dollar price per tonne .
The correct way to do it is to calculate whether a company is foreign owned or not .
Some Chinese companies are fully [ foreign ] owned – and all they are doing is paying the production price of coal , which is currently $ 12 - 20 a tonne .
So it ’s not really worth $ 10 billion .
The money that needs to be coming into the transition away from coal should come from a nationalised coal industry .
If we ’re serious about this transition , we ca n’t afford to have coal companies skipping the country .
We should be nationalising it , or at the very least upping the royalties to 80 % , and that money would pay for the transition .
Because , make no mistake about it , these coal companies will skip the country once it starts to wear out .
Can coal be phased out and be used to fund a transition in the meantime ?
Some climate activists I have spoken to over the years say if you nationalise coal , then the government will just want to keep that revenue source and so coal will never be phased out .
Yes , it can be phased out and nationalised as well .
This would make it a lot easier to get the money required .
The government would have pressure from the public not to continue with it .
Because part of the process of nationalising it would be the actual deduction of [ the cost of ] the just transition .
What role do trade unions have to play in creating a just transition ?
First and foremost [ they need to be ] the leaders of it .
We ca n’t leave this transition up to coal companies – we need to run it ourselves .
Trade unions will need to supervise it .
They ’ll be the driving force behind it .
They will show that it can be done .
The trade unions ’ role is to show by example : to point out to the state government , the federal government , or to local councils , that this is how it ’s to be done and we expect you to play your part .
Do you think workers would have to leave the mining and energy union and join another union as part of a transition plan ?
Or will the union itself , along with its workers , become a changed entity ?
Well by default we wo n’t need a mining union to cover the coal mining industry [ forever ] – though there would still need to be some regulation of it [ as coal mining is phased out ] .
I would suggest the union would just change its emphasis from “ mining ” to “ energy ” and “ construction ” .
Have you seen any encouraging first steps towards a just transition plan in the Hunter Valley or elsewhere ?
I understand you recently visited the Latrobe Valley in Victoria and discussed this .
Well , they ’ve already got their rudimentary plan up and running , they ’ve had 10 years .
Here in the Hunter Valley we ’ve got a report , produced by Newcastle University ’s Centre of Full Employment and Equity , and it ’s a blueprint for a transition .
The best thing is how it shows there will be more jobs in a green economy .
And that ’s not surprising because the experience overseas almost every time shows that to be the case .
So there ’s not much green energy in Australia yet there certainly will be , and we know there will be .
In the Latrobe Valley in Victoria union members are setting up two projects .
One is a kit for asbestos removal .
Its been developed by the union workers and its been tested in the asbestos removal industry and they ’ve said it ’s right .
The other thing they ’ve done is build a prototype of a solar hot water heater for homes [ as a possible new green industry for the region ] .
Its been done in conjunction with a private company because the union has limited finances to do it alone .
The other thing is a few years back they constructed some wind turbines for a Danish company .
The Danes came out and had a look at them and said “ yes , they ’re fine , they ’re the best we ’ve seen ” .
They are good examples of what ’s happening , what has happened , and are a pointer to the future .
I know that the Upper Hunter Greens [ party ] and other community activists have been involved in a campaign to protect farmland around Caroona and Liverpool plains from coalmines .
You have worked with people who are in the Farmers ’ Federation .
Are any of these farmers looking at the question of a just transition ?
Yes they are – in particular those farmers in the Caroona area , we ’ve worked with them .
Farmers in the Hunter Valley are in a different type of agriculture .
There are different types .
But the thing in common with all of them is that they are aware of modern technology and they see new modern technology as being less carbon intensive .
They also see that we are running out of certain types of fertiliser and stuff that they use .
They want to know : after peak oil where we are going to get that from , those inputs that they need .
And they are well aware that we need research into it , and they ’re prepared to back that research into the stuff we ’re talking about .
It may not necessarily be wind turbines , it may not be hot water services .
But its farmland stuff , it ’s new technology and can be part of the transition .
If [ federal National Party senator ]
Barnaby Joyce is to be believed , every farmer is a climate sceptic .
But it would seem you have spoken to farmers who are quite conscious of climate change .
Yes , and they may not be as sceptical as Barnaby Joyce thinks they are .
This is because they ’ve looked around and have seen what ’s happening .
There ’s nothing like looking around at other countries to see that there is a problem .
A lot of those [ farmers ] are wealthy , there ’s no doubt about that .
Some have lived overseas , and they know there ’s a problem there .
It ’s not hard to convince them .
There ’s a connection between Australia and Scandinavia because of the wheat ships .
They can tell you what it ’s like in Sweden now , where there ’s little snow in Stockholm anymore , all it does is rain and freeze , and they get this sludge on the footpath .
And they ca n’t move on the Baltic like they did before because the ice is so thin .
There are also a lot of people who know that in Scandinavia they use cogeneration [ a process where excess heat generated from power plants is captured for use ] to heat their houses .
And last summer it reached 38 °C and there ’s is no mechanism to turn the heating off – they ’ve never had to turn it off before .
So those farmers know exactly what ’s going on there – they can tell you all about it .
I understand you have spoken to a representative of the Electrical Trades Union ( ETU ) who has been on a delegation to Europe to look at the renewables industry ?
Yes , I spoke to the ETU environment officer Imogen Schoots and she was telling us that a high level delegation went , led by ETU secretary Dean Mighell , and they saw first hand a transition away from coal towards renewable energy .
They can see it ’s slightly different to what ’s happening here , and that ’s to be expected .
But all in all they think the transition is viable and they ’re prepared to start planning for a transition as well .
Do you think it could be useful for some of the more progressive Australian unions like the metalworkers and the ETU to sponsor a speaking tour of their European counterparts who work in the renewable energy sector ?
For sure , I think that ’s definitely a worthwhile project because they would be able to tell us what they told the ETU delegates .
It would definitely be of benefit .
You yourself are going on a speaking tour soon for the socialist youth organisation , Resistance ?
Yes , I ’m going through the southern states and into Perth to talk about a transition , and hopefully we can get some results out of that as well .
Thank you very much for speaking with Green Left Weekly .
Thank you .

Top 10 Recession - Related Scams Learn to recognize them and share them with vulnerable friends and relatives .
Aug. 3 , 2009  --
The National Consumers League is warning that recession - related scams continue to flourish , as desperate consumers look for ways to make a buck .
The most worrisome schemes are those that promise people an easy way to make some extra money .
NCL says the timing is terrible , because at the same time fraudsters are striking , many government watchdog agencies are thinning their staffs for budget reasons .

Here are some of the most common recession - related scams .
Learn to recognize them and share them with more vulnerable friends and relatives .
Fake Checks :
This scam usually targets people who are selling something like a car .
The scammer makes a tempting offer , then sends what looks like a cashier 's check for more than the agreed - upon amount .
The crook asks the seller to cash the check and return the difference to him .
( The bad guys have lots of excuses for doing this . )
Many banks initially clear these fake checks , then later force the victim to repay the money , because you are responsible when you deposit a bad check .
NCL says a large portion of recent fake check schemes involve mystery shopping jobs and fraudulent sweepstakes .
Work at home : A lot of advertised work - at - home offers are frauds .
You are probably not going to make millions stuffing envelopes , doing medical billing or making arts and crafts at home .
Phishing : Crooks send you an e-mail that looks like it's from your bank and then ask for all the personal financial information needed to steal your identity .
Phishing has been a problem for years , but these days crooks are tailoring their pitches to relate to the banking and mortgage crises .
Recession Scams Target Recession Sufferers
Foreclosure Rescue :
With foreclosures at record levels , some crooked businesses are approaching people and claiming they can save their homes .
They take a huge fee up front and do nothing or they get you to sign the title to your house over to them .
Here are the Top 10 Frauds according to the National Consumers League :
1. Fake Check Scams
2. Internet : Gen Merchandise
3. Prizes / Sweepstakes / Free Gifts
4. Phishing / Spoofing
5. Nigerian Money Offers ( not prizes )
6. Business Opportunities / Franchises / Distributorship
7. Advance Fee Loans , Credit Arrangers
8. Friendship & Sweetheart Swindles
9. Internet : Auctions
10 . Lotteries / Lottery Ticket Buying Clubs

The invention of ideology .
The Home Valuation Code of Conduct had an unusual origin .
It was developed by the New York attorney general , Andrew M. Cuomo , who persuaded the big federal mortgage agencies , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , to adopt it .
That has effectively made it national policy .
Putting appraisals completely in the hands of lenders may sound like a good idea in principle , because it is supposed to be lenders who are putting their money at risk in a home loan .
But the reality is that many companies that write home loans these days do not have much incentive to worry about the accuracy of appraisals .
That is because the companies do not keep the loans on their own books , instead selling them to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac .
“ The code is a formula for continued problems with fraud , ” said David Callahan , a senior fellow with the public policy group Demos who has studied appraisals .
“ Appraisers have been asking for a long time for a reliable firewall between themselves and lenders , and are further from it than ever . ”
Appraisers Pressured
Before real estate prices went out of control , appraisal work was straightforward .
The appraiser examined a property inside and out , judging it against the prices that similar properties in the neighborhood were fetching .
If the appraisal value matched the sales price , the lender financed the loan .
As lending standards collapsed during the housing boom , appraisers were pressured from all sides .
When the appraiser did not deliver a satisfactory price , the deal did not get done , and the broker , agent and lender did not get their fees .
Homeowners also loved inflated appraisals , using them to take out as much as possible when they refinanced .
“ I got daily calls from lenders and brokers saying , ‘ Here ’s the address .
Can you get me $ 400,000 ? ’ ” said Mr. Kennedy , who has been in the business since 1993 .
Quotations
And he gave it for his opinion , " that whoever could make two ears of corn , or two blades of grass , to grow upon a spot of ground where only one grew before , would deserve better of mankind , and do more essential service to his country , than the whole race of politicians put together . ”
I said there was a society of men among us , bred up from their youth in the art of proving by words multiplied for the purpose , that white is black , and black is white , according as they are paid . [… ]
It is a maxim among these lawyers , that whatever hath been done before may legally be done again : and therefore they take special care to record all the decisions formerly made against common justice and the general reason of mankind .
These , under the name of precedents , they produce as authorities , to justify the most iniquitous opinions ; and the judges never fail of decreeing accordingly .
Rob Owens , 49 , who is a lorry driver , placed his bin on a patch of grass at the end of a path leading to his home because he was going away for a few days and did not want to block the path .
MyVibe is probably the first x-rated app approved by Apple — following the introduction of content ratings — and the first vibrator .
Sexual health expert Dr. Debby Herbenick has tried it .
Here are her thoughts on it ( NSFW ) :

If you have n't already checked out MyPleasure .com 's MyVibe app in the iPhone 's app store , you might want to .
Unlike many saucy apps out there , MyVibe is free — and fun .
Here 's how it works :
There 's an on / off button that looks like many computer on / offs so it 's easily recognizable .
On the right there are up and down arrows to control your vibration - short , quick pulses ( smaller # s ) or longer slower ones ( higher #s , up to 100 ) .

The intensity of the vibration MyPleasure could use for this app is obviously limited by the amount of vibration that the iPhone offers , so the orgasmic potential of the MyVibe app is similarly limited .
However , orgasms — while fun — are n't everything .
Anticipation , teasing and seduction play a major role in many people 's sex lives .
Why not turn on the app , hold the iPhone discreetly against your body while on the metro , in a cab or at work as you exchange sultry IMs or Twitter DMs with your real life partner or dream partner ?
Having a little vibration can add excitement and tingles to your day ( and your genitals ) .

Years ago I had this idea for The Pursinator , which was this cool contraption that would allow you to hang your purse on any table or bar surface so it never had to get stashed on the ground .
We even developed a logo for it , we just never got around to developing the actual product .
Recently we got a call from some company who has invented MY pursinator ( though they call it something else ) wanting us to market this great invention , not even knowing I already had a well thought out marketing plan that 'd been stewing in my head for the past five years .
Back when I was working a full time internship , going to school full time and bartending full time , I become an expert at shaving seconds off of my daily commute by knowing exactly where to stand on the subway platform so I could exit or transfer most easily .
Yeah , my life was n't so full of fun back then , but my little brother , a techy genius , was full of admiration of this " skill " when he came to visit me and later moved here , and decided we should invent a software that would give anyone access to this valuable info ( for a small fee ) .
He said he had it all worked out in his head , it would n't be a problem and we'd make millions !
Of course , it was all over the news this morning that somebody , a brother and sister team no less , has invented this amazing software .
It 's a classic story -- paint randomly splattered on a canvas , the Snuggly , a simple device that chops vegis into perfect jullienned delights , the ShamWow , a book about how to get free stuff when you 're a struggling college student .
Who does n't look at this stuff and say " I could 've done THAT ! " ??
But the sad reality is , you did n't .
The designers on this site have all executed their ideas ( at least some of them ) , and to my credit , we invented LupRocks , which was no small feat , but I 'm going to go on a limb here and suggest that all of us have plenty of ideas that we 're not making good use of and ask what , exactly , is the hold up ?!
Everyone 's heard that it's not about the idea , it 's about the execution .
So if you 've got some scheme for making the best ever ________ , there 's no value in that .... until you execute it .
And if it really is a good idea you can bet that sooner or later somebody is going to execute it and you 're going to be kicking yourself for a long time .
Learn from the lessons of the Pursinator and know that even with a great name or a kick ass logo , it 's going to be nothing but an idea in your head or an old file on your computer until you actually get out there and do something about it .

Bike of the future will never be stolen , has puncture - proof tyres and will play music as you ride
It will count calories as you pedal , play music and use a solar - powered motor when you get tired - welcome to the commuter bike of the future .
Olympic cyclist Chris Boardman was today unveiling a design that he believes will be an everyday product within 20 years .
The 40 - year - old said the technology was already available , it just needed the will to put it all together .
Boardman 's bike will be attractive to commuters due to its ' unbreakable ' lock
The new bike , which would cost around £ 2,000 , includes an inbuilt computer system incorporating an ' unbreakable ' locking device that allows only the owner to open it via fingerprint recognition
A mini computer on the handlebars counts the calories the cyclist is burning by monitoring each turn of the pedals .
Chris Boardman in action .
The Olympic cyclist has designed a bike of the future
Spoke - less wheels make the bike more aerodynamic while the tyres will be puncture - proof with self - inflating tyres .
' The tyre ( and rim ) rotate around the doughnut shape which is fixed , a bit like having a bangle on your wrist - it can spin on your wrist without your wrist turning , ' Mr Boardman explained .
Owners of the bike , which is still being designed , wo n't even always have to pedal - a battery - assisted motor run by solar panels takes over if they get tired .
Plus the frame is made of carbon fibre , making the bike strong and lightweight .
Boardman , who led a research team for British Cycling in the run-up to the Beijing Olympics , said the bike would not be ' financially feasible ' for 20 years .
However , the 1992 Olympic gold medalist for the four - kilometre pursuit added : ' It could be built now if there was a will .
All the technologies are already there , it 's just that nobody 's put them all together before . '
He told the MailOnline : ' What will happen is elements of the design ( such as solar powered lighting and integrating components into the frame ) will be
feed into near future bike designs .
' Boardman bikes will be doing some of this in the next one to two years . '
Tom Bogdanowicz , campaign manager at London Cycling Campaign , said : ' Some of the ideas behind this bike are clearly things cyclists want .
But it really needs to be affordable .'

Ubuntu developers are currently developing a centralised “ App Store ” to simplify the dding / removing / updating / configuring of software within Ubuntu .
The name of this application called " Ubuntu App Centre " The Ubuntu Software Store will be a single graphical interface for package management in Ubuntu .
In version 1 , it will take the basic philosophy of Add / Remove Applications and make it even easier to use .
In later versions it will grow to replace Synaptic , gdebi , some parts of the Computer Janitor , and possibly Update Manager .
Having a single interface will make handling software easier , socially improve security , hopefully free space on the CD , and provide a prominent showcase for Ubuntu and partner software .
The implementation is based on Add / Remove Applications ( gnome - app - install ) , but may use Package Kit for some components .
The team behind it have set out a preliminary road map for the development of an Ubuntu ‘ App Centre ’ that stretch over the next four releases .
( 9.10 – > 11.04 ) with the full replacement the current Package Management tools by App Centre being introduced during 10.04 and refinement / new features being added to it after that .
Goals for ‘ App Centre ’ in Ubuntu 9.10
1 Include in Ubuntu 9.10 a simple and fun interface for finding , installing , and removing software .
This will likely involve :
* A new name .
* A highly graphical “ main entrance ” or “ front page ” , that allows browsing software by category and subcategory , and perhaps includes featured and / or popular applications .
* Fast and error - tolerant search .
* Attractive , informative , and easy - to - understand presentation of individual software packages within the interface ( with this presentation also being used for apt : URL links to graphical applications ) .
* Interactive demonstration of how to launch the software you ’ve just installed .
* The ability to continue browsing available software , and queue up installation / removal requests , while other changes are being made .
* Better security than the current installation mechanism ( i.e. use of Policy Kit instead of gksudo ) .
2 Increase use of apt : links by Ubuntu enthusiasts , software projects , and ISVs , replacing terminal commands or standalone downloads .
This will likely involve :
* A redirector Web service ( e.g. redirecting from http://apt.ubuntu.com/package-name to apt : package - name ) , with helpful handling of error cases , to better cater for people who are not running Ubuntu when they follow the link ( and to better cater for forums and other CMSes that do not allow direct apt : links ) .
* Prominent and highly understandable information on ubuntu.com about how to get your software ( whether Free or non-Free ) packaged for Ubuntu .
* An apt : evangelism campaign for projects that already have their software packaged in the Ubuntu repositories .
3 Fine - tune the interface presented when software updates are available .
This may involve :
* When updates are presented automatically , collapsing the list of updates by default , concentrating instead on the existence of updates and the choice to install them now or later .
* Presentation of the new better descriptions of security updates .
4 Establish a system within Launchpad for registered users to suggest a better description , category , keywords , and / or screenshot for a software package , and for the package maintainer to incorporate those changes into a new version of the package , so that end users can find the software more easily later .
Ubuntu App Centre mock - up ’s from Ubuntu Wiki
Below are some ‘ mock - up ’s taken from the ‘ App Centre ’ wiki page which show the first glimpses ( subject to user approval ) at what the unified centre may look like .
You can check the progress of this application on Ubuntu wiki page from here and here .
I hope this would help more and more people to move back to ubuntu .

More than two million teenagers have attended in the last 15 years , said Mr. Luce , a 45 - year - old , mop - headed father of three with a master ’s degree from the Graduate School of Business Administration at Harvard and the star power of an aging rock guitarist .
“ That ’s more than Paul McCartney has pulled in , ” Mr. Luce asserted , before bounding onstage for the opening pyrotechnics and a prayer .
For the next two days , the teenagers in the arena pogoed to Christian bands , pledged to lead their friends to Christ and sang an anthem with the chorus , “ We wo n’t be silent . ”
Hundreds streamed down the aisles for the altar call and knelt in front of the stage , some weeping openly as they prayed to give their lives to God .
The next morning , Mr. Luce led the crowd in an exercise in which they wrote on scraps of paper all the negative cultural influences , brand names , products and television shows that they planned to excise from their lives .
Again they streamed down the aisles , this time to throw away the “ cultural garbage . ”
Trash cans filled with folded pieces of paper on which the teenagers had scribbled things like Ryan Seacrest , Louis Vuitton , “ Gilmore Girls , ” “ Days of Our Lives , ” Iron Maiden , Harry Potter , “ need for a boyfriend ” and “ my perfect teeth obsession . ”
One had written in tiny letters : “ fornication . ”
Some teenagers threw away cigarette lighters , brand - name sweatshirts , Mardi Gras beads and CD’s — one titled “ I ’m a Hustla . ”
“ Lord Jesus , ” Mr. Luce prayed into the microphone as the teenagers dropped their notes into the trash , “ I strip off the identity of the world , and this morning I clothe myself with Christ , with his lifestyle .
That ’s what I want to be known for . ”

Introducing pure C# FLAC encoder based on Flake Reply # 8 – 2009-08-27 21:12:26
hah yeah i was checking out your code on sourceforge or wherever you have it and i noticed an awful lot of the recent revisions had been all related to FLAKE ..
i figured something was up
kind of made me want to get back into programming looking at it , to be honest .
used to be a hobby of mine , but i lost it over the years .. and I was kind of getting away from it when .NET framework started coming out ...
I remember a couple of the System namespaces , etc provide a lot of the base functions for the programs , but by no means was I a pro at it , just experimental .
I had always been a C / C++ fan , so the idea of C# and .NET framework seemed interesting to me .
Ah yes ... I remember ..
I was an ASM programmer for 2 - 3 years there , and the last thing I wanted to do was go home and code .
What is a good resource for getting a good overall idea of the .NET framework ?
I suppose MSDN would be a good start to just look up the different namespaces and what all functionality each provided .
I know and understand the code part of it ( as far as like the part that is based on C / C++ coding ) .. but I need to find something to help tie that in with .
NET .
Couple of questions .. sorry to really get off the ' main ' topic , but I have a couple of questions ...
What are the differences between the different major versions of .NET framework ... 1 , 2 , 3 , 3.5 , etc .
I 'm assuming added functionality , but were there any major changes or additions , etc that changed the way the framework was used , or what it could do ?
I just need to get to google and look it up .. but I just wanted to say that I did look at certain parts of your code for CUETools , and it gave me a little bit of motivation / interest to maybe get back into it as a hobby --- so thanks for that !
Btw , I heard that the compiler for .NET apps basically converts all the languages into some intermediary code , then compiles that ... essentially suggesting that no one coding language was necessarily ' better ' in terms of the end compile 's speed / memory footprint / functionality ..
meaning that regardless if you create the same program in visual basic / c# / c++ , they should all result in the same optimized code in the end , since a lot of it is all sharing the same codebase via .
NET .
is this true ?
( i do understand that it is up to the programmer to make their code efficient , optimized , etc and that can definitely have a huge impact on performance ) .. but essentially , if the same coder wrote the same program the same way in each of the languages , the end compile is going to be about the same ?
i know that ASM programmers used to brag how compact , efficient , and powerful their code was and laugh at visual basic programmers , " drawing " their programs , writing simplistic code with all of these DLL / OCX dependencies and it basically being " kiddie coding " .... but it seems technology like .
NET has kind of leveled the playing field out a bit , considering each of these languages are relying on the same set of " dependencies " , etc .
I mean , to me ...
I have no bias really , because I have written programs in visual basic before , and i coded ASM programs for a living too ... so really , i do n't see something like visual basic or visual c# to be " coding for beginners " .
it 's code that is easier to understand , write , and manage .. is that a sin ?
depends who you ask i guess ...
IMO , i feel that visual C++ can sometimes get a little more complicated with stuff like dereferencing of pointers and this type of thing , and of course visual basic is at times a little too ... basic , as it is a bit copy and paste this , drag this here ... then do something like whatever .
Color = blue , it 's almost like programming in english -- it seems to me that C# is a nice compromise between the two languages ... the power of c++ with the simplicity of visual basic -- and i believe that was probably the intended result .
anyways , enough of the ramble .. got to get back to work .
Greg Sargent simplifies the question :
Public , government - run health care was key to not one , but both of Kennedy ’s final health care initiatives .
One of these , of course , has already gotten lots of attention :
The version of health care reform that emerged this spring from Kennedy ’s Senate health and labor committee , which contained a public option .
But there ’s another , oft - overlooked initiative Kennedy championed that makes the point even more strongly .
I ’m talking about the Medicare for All bill , which was wholly Kennedy ’s baby .
Kennedy introduced Medicare for All in 2005 and 2007 and it never got voted out of committee .
According to the Commonwealth Fund , a respected health care policy group , it was a “ universal public insurance program ” that would offer compulsory “ Medicare type benefits ” from cradle to grave .
Public , government - run health care .
“ It would have functioned similar to the way Medicare functions now , ” Sarah Collins , a vice president at Commonwealth , told our reporter , Amanda Erickson .
“ It would have been basically a public health option , a single payer proposal . ”

When I first heard about Sarah Palin ’s resignation on NPR last Friday , I too was sucked into the whirlwind of speculation —
Is this a preemptive retreat from some looming scandal ?
Is it the first step in a 2012 presidential bid ?
Why so rambling and incoherent ?
What is she saying , and if she has any higher political aspirations , why does n’t she have somebody competent writing her speeches ?
After thinking about this for a few days , seeing what the MSM and blogosphere have had to say and finally reading the full text of her speech — posted verbatim in all its rambling , ungrammatical glory on the gubernatorial website –I am only surprised that so many journalists and commentators persist in reading this move as part of some Machiavellian political scheme .
At the same time , I fear the schadenfreude crowd may be disappointed in their hopes of a really , really juicy scandal that would take her down for good .
I think a much more likely , if less dramatic , explanation can be had from a combination of three basic interpretive strategies :
A close reading of Palin ’s own words , supplemented by the biographical and historical context of readily available information about her personal and political history , especially the recent Vanity Fair exposé .
The upshot : Sarah hates the media ( unless they are unequivocally adoring ) , hates the tedious bureaucratic processes of government , hates pesky ethics questions and the time and money it costs to deal with them , hates Juneau , and hates the “ haters , ” as she calls anyone who criticizes or questions her .
She loves campaigning , loves basking in the glow of an adoring crowd , loves taking credit for distributing surplus money , but her current situation offers fewer and fewer such opportunities .
Alaskan journalists report that she ’s been basically phoning it in since the presidential election , if not from the very beginning of her term .
As one anonymous friend reported , “ She hates her life . ”
Sometimes the truth is really just that simple .
If we want to make it a bit more complicated , we can add :
Economic analysis .
In her speech , Palin said quite explicitly and at some length that she and Todd are personally on the hook for over half a million dollars in legal fees for defending against legal and ethical complaints ( and Alaskan journalists previously reported that those fees are as yet unpaid ) .
As of Fall 2008 , the Palins ’ household income was only a bit over $ 250 k and net worth only a little over $ 1.2 million .
This may be affluent enough to make a mockery of her claim to be an “ ordinary working - class American , ” but it ’s not all that much for an upwardly mobile couple in their prime earning years with three underage children ( including a one - year - old with developmental disabilities ) to raise and support before they can retire , plus a barely - of - age daughter and infant grandchild living at home , in a state with a notoriously high cost of living .
It ’s certainly not enough to support a newly acquired taste for designer clothes or to pay off massive and undoubtedly still growing legal fees .
Palin ’s salary as governor is only $ 125 k a year , and her ability to earn additional income is limited by her office : controversy is already swirling over reports of a multi-million dollar advance for Palin ’s recent book contract .
At the same time , Palin ’s national celebrity puts her in the way of millions of dollars a year in speaker fees , media gigs , and other lucrative para- political activities , all free from any legal or ethical limitations or disclosure requirements .
An additional eighteen months buried in the Alaska governor ’s office , ineffectually battling a recalcitrant legislature over a tight budget and fending off ethical complaints big and small would do absolutely nothing to increase her current value on the conservative media market and lecture circuit , and it is entirely possible that time could significantly diminish her earning potential .
Given the above , it actually makes perfect sense that Palin would quit , despite her insistence that she is Not Quitting , Just Moving Forward to Bigger and Better Things Instead of Going with the Flow Like a Dead Fish .
I ’m guessing this is precisely the same argument she ’s made to herself and others since she first transferred colleges ( five times ) , as well as at the conclusion of her remarkably brief stints as a sports reporter , snow - machine entrepreneur , mayor and member of the state energy commission .
Palin ’s entire history demonstrates that she embraces new opportunities with gusto and then tosses them aside as soon as they cease to be pleasurable or rewarding –or as soon as she has gotten out of them whatever she needs to prepare herself for the Next Big Move .
Sarah “ Barracuda ” Palin has gotten more than she ever dreamed out of the governorship — a place on the national political stage .
Why would she stick around for the “ lame ” job of actually governing ?
But the Next Big Move , I think we can all rest assured , is NOT a 2012 presidential run .
I ’d like to think that Palin herself has realized that she simply does n’t have the discipline for and ca n’t stand the peculiar pressures of a national political campaign .
If she has been hurt by previous attempts to dig up dirt on her and the unkind comments directed at her family and herself , it ’s hard to imagine she is willing to put them all through that again for a shot at a job that pays only $ 400 k a year and requires a 24/7 commitment to precisely the activities she most hates : negotiating with people who disagree with her , taking advice , being questioned by the press and being stuck in an office far from Wasilla .
It should be abundantly clear by now that however powerfully Palin resonates with right - wing Christian voters , she has a very hard time getting along with the real powerbrokers of the party — the wealthy donors , fiscal conservatives and political hacks who are so crucial to any successful GOP campaign .
But in the increasingly unlikely chance that she still harbors presidential ambitions , I feel confident in predicting that a Palin primary campaign will either go down in flames or fold like a house of cards within a couple of months .
The fact that she did n’t have the sense to prepare ( or have prepared for her ) a coherent gubernatorial resignation statement makes it clear that she lacks either the desire or the basic political savvy to get anywhere near a successful GOP primary .
And sure , it ’s possible her timing was nudged by questions about the financing of The House That Todd Built , and it ’s entirely possible those accusations are true .
But the Contractorgate investigation is hardly at a level that would have cast her out of the governor ’s office before the end of her term , if she ’d actually wanted to stay there , and by national political standards ( not to mention Alaskan ones ) , it ’s pretty piddly stuff .
Frankly , I do n’t believe she ’s really afraid of any of the ethics questions that have accumulated against her , no matter how true they might be — Palin has an enormous capacity for self - justification and seems quite sincerely convinced that because she is doing God ’s will , everything she does has God ’s stamp of approval , no matter what the “ haters ” or intrusive government bureaucrats might say .
Which leads me to my final hypothesis about the peculiar timing , wording and affect of Palin ’s announcement — the bizarre combination of self - pitying victimhood and grandiose prophecies of better things to come and the peculiar way in which she marshaled her children as justification for her resignation but never even once trotted out the reliable political - resignation cliché of “ wanting to spend more time with her family . ”
Psychological analysis .
My guess is that what we witnessed on July 3 was a textbook case of the painful downside of narcissistic personality disorder , described by the Mayo Clinic as “ a mental disorder in which people have an inflated sense of their own importance and a deep need for admiration .
They believe that they ’re superior to others and have little regard for other people ’s feelings .
But behind this mask of ultra-confidence lies a fragile self - esteem , vulnerable to the slightest criticism . ”
Now , I realize that armchair psychology is a dangerous game , and it ’s entirely possible Palin is just a garden variety narcissist , a personality type reasonably common among politicians and successful people in many fields .
But I think that this hypothesis explains a lot about some of the more perplexing aspects of Palin ’s career and persona , particularly the rambling nature of this major announcement and her deer - in - the - headlights affect while giving it .
It explains her remarkable rise and astonishing self - confidence despite lack of actual qualifications for most of the jobs she ’s held and her extremely thin record of accomplishment in those roles .
It explains the absolute sincerity with which she informed reporters that she “ did n’t blink ” when nominated to the second highest office in the land .
It explains why she probably really believes her own inflated rhetoric about Alaska ’s central importance to national security and the superiority of small - town mayoralty to congressional service as a qualification for national executive office .
It also offers a possible explanation for the less impressive aspects of her political and personal career .
It explains why the tundra is littered with the bodies of former mentors and supporters she has turned on once they ’ve served their purpose .
It explains why she so insistently and perversely resisted the efforts of McCain staffers to help her prepare for debates , interviews , and national media scrutiny .
It explains why she refers to virtually anyone who criticizes her as “ haters . ”
It explains why her resignation statement was such an incoherent mishmash of self - pitying victimhood and triumphalist prophecies of future victory against the sinister forces preparing to take down America .
If I ’m right , Palin ’s narcissistic personality ( whether pathologically disordered or just far too rapidly inflated and then challenged by her unexpectedly sudden rise to the forefront of national politics ) also explains the powerful magnetism with which she has charmed so many conservatives .
There is something deeply compelling about such complete and utter conviction that one is uniquely destined to accomplish great things — a point that could arguably be made just as well about Bill Clinton and George W. Bush , although I want to make clear that I do n’t think either suffers from more than garden - variety narcissism , and I am quite sure that at least one has far more intelligence and real accomplishments and both had far more political savvy and campaign discipline than Palin has ever shown any inkling of .
And in Palin ’s ( and Bush ’s ) case , that personal grandiosity and refusal to countenance opposition meshes nicely with the messianic and apocalyptic rhetoric at the center of conservative Christian politics .
Palin already attracts the kind of uncritical adoration you see in die - hard Clinton and Bush fans , and if she plays her cards right , she can parlay her unexpected political stardom into a lucrative and psychologically gratifying career doing precisely what she did best in the 2008 campaign — rallying the faithful , preaching to the choir , repeating stump speeches filled with folksy clichés , looking good in expensive outfits chosen by a competent stylist — without any of the intense media scrutiny , campaign discipline or relentless work that a career in electoral politics requires , all while maintaining her home base in Wasilla and letting somebody else pay for her travel Outside .
All in all , I think it ’s pretty much the ideal way of gratifying Palin ’s ambitions while completely disappearing her from the national political radar .
It ’s really a win-win .
The cheers of her self - selected audiences at conservative events all over the nation will undoubtedly fill her with the gratifying sense that she is making a difference on a national scale–and be equally gratifying to the audiences .
But since such speeches are almost never covered by the national media and have little substantive impact on the course of political history , those of us who do n’t pay to hear them can return to blissful unawareness of her existence .
So long , Sarah .
It ’s been . . . interesting .

And government - paid insurance surely would n't be forking over the estimated $ 1.4 million per day that the health insurance industry is spending to lobby members of Congress to block competition from a government plan - and , with it , more choices for Americans .
The army of lobbyists includes 350 former government staff members who - before they took the revolving door for a spin - worked for the very same committees that are writing the legislation .
The announcement this morning ( pdf ! ) by Commodity Futures Trading Commission chairman Gary Gensler that his agency is considering imposing limits on the size of trades by energy futures speculators may amount to something of a landmark ( or turning point , or whatever portentous phrase you prefer ) in Washington ’s relationship to financial markets .
Gensler justified the move as part of the CFTC ’s duty “ to eliminate , diminish or prevent the undue burdens on interstate commerce that may result from excessive speculation . ”
This is a big deal because , for the past 40 years , financial regulators have increasingly gravitated toward the position that speculation can never be excessive .
As an official in the Clinton Treasury Department in the late 1990s , in fact , Gensler helped fight off efforts by then - CFTC chairman Brooksley Born to rein in what she felt was excessive speculation in over - the - counter derivatives markets .
Yet now here he is proposing new rules to rein in oil and natural gas speculators .
The roots of the benign attitude toward speculation that prevailed in recent decades can be found ( among other places I ’m sure , but those places are n’t on my bookshelf ) in a famous 1953 paper by Milton Friedman on “ The Case for Flexible Exchange Rates ” ( which in turn can be found in his book Essays in Positive Economics ) .
The basic thrust of the paper — that anything but a permanently fixed exchange rate or a free - floating one is inherently destabilizing — still holds up reasonably well .
But I ’m not so sure about this passage on speculation :
People who argue that speculation is generally destabilizing seldom realize that this is largely equivalent to saying that speculators lose money , since speculation can be destabilizing in general only if speculators on the average sell when the currency is low in price and buy when it is high .
Maybe it ’s the “ in general ” that ’s the problem here .
On average and over time , the argument may be right .
But there are surely extended periods during which price bubbles persist — as in the oil futures market last year — and speculators make lots of money by betting on further price increases , thus destabilizing markets .
So Gensler is proposing rules that would limit just how much speculators can bet energy price movements , to rein in those wild price movements .
This is of a piece with a speech made a couple weeks ago ( via Simon Johnson via Kevin Drum ) by Tim Geithner ’s successor at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York , Bill Dudley ( who , like the CFTC ’s Gensler , is a Goldman Sachs alum ) .
Said Dudley :
1. Asset bubbles may not be that hard to identify — especially large ones .
For example , the housing bubble in the United States had been identified by many by 2005 , and the compressed nature of risk spreads and the increased leverage in the financial system was very well known going into 2007 .
2 . If one means by monetary policy the instrument of short - term interest rates , then I agree that monetary policy is not well - suited to deal with asset bubbles .
But this suggests that it might be better for central bankers to examine the efficacy of other instruments in their toolbox , rather than simply ignoring the development of asset bubbles .
3 . If existing tools are judged inadequate , then central banks should work on developing additional policy instruments .
Let ’s take the housing bubble as an example .
Housing prices rose far faster than income .
As a result , underwriting standards deteriorated .
If regulators had forced mortgage originators to tighten up their standards or had forced the originators and securities issuers to keep “ skin in the game ” , I think the housing bubble might not have been so big .
I think that this crisis has demonstrated that the cost of waiting to clean up asset bubbles after they burst can be very high .
That suggests we should explore how to respond earlier .
This may be the emerging orthodoxy : Speculative bubbles are real , and we can do something about about them .
What exactly that something will be is still — apart from , it appears , position limits for oil futures traders — very much up in the air .
Update : Robin Hanson has a different ( and , as always , provocative ) take on all this .
WASHINGTON  The Obama administration announced Monday that it would seek to ban many routine uses of antibiotics in farm animals in hopes of reducing the spread of dangerous bacteria in humans .
In written testimony to the House Rules Committee , Dr. Joshua Sharfstein , principal deputy commissioner of food and drugs , said feeding antibiotics to healthy chickens , pigs and cattle  done to encourage rapid growth  should cease .
And Dr. Sharfstein said farmers should no longer be able to use antibiotics in animals without the supervision of a veterinarian .
Both practices lead to the development of bacteria that are immune to many treatments , he said .
The hearing was held to discuss a measure proposed by Representative Louise M. Slaughter , Democrat of New York and chairwoman of the Rules Committee .
It would ban seven classes of antibiotics important to human health from being used in animals , and would restrict other antibiotics to therapeutic and some preventive uses .
The legislation is supported by the American Medical Association , among other groups , but opposed by farm organizations like the National Pork Producers Council .
The farm lobby ’s opposition makes its passage unlikely , but advocates are hoping to include the measure in the legislation to revamp the health care system .
But lawyers in Britain seeking his extradition have said his actions were not as benign as he has claimed , and that the diagnosis was made long after the computer hacking occurred , at a time when the legal case was well advanced .
Describing him as the most prolific and damaging computer hacker in the history of the United States military , they have maintained that he intended to damage American security by acts of “ intimidation and coercion , ” that he stole more than 1,000 passwords from high - security computer networks and that it cost $ 700,000 to repair the damage he caused .
They have also said that Mr. McKinnon left a message in one Pentagon computer making clear that his actions were politically motivated .
In court , they represented the message as having said : “ U.S. foreign policy is akin to government - sponsored terrorism .
I will continue to disrupt at the highest possible level . ”
Mr. McKinnon faces eight counts of computer fraud in New Jersey and Virginia , where some of the computer networks he compromised were located .
His lawyers and family say he could face a prison sentence of up to 60 years , though American prosecutors have said that he would be likely to get no more than a 10 - year sentence .
In legal submissions in Britain , the lawyers have argued that Mr. McKinnon should be tried in Britain , where the potential penalties are far less severe , and that he might commit suicide if forced to stand trial in the United States .
His mother , Janis Sharp , said Friday that she feared for his life if he was extradited .
“ Gary would not survive , and I would never see my son again , ” she said .
“ All to oblige the Americans ? ”
Britain ’s National Autistic Society said it was extremely disappointed .
“ We are angry that Gary is in this position , ” Amanda Batten , the society ’s policy chief , said .
“ We will continue campaigning and do all we can to support Gary to stay in the U.K . ”
The case has prompted an increasingly acrimonious debate over the fairness of a new extradition treaty reached by Britain and the United States in 2003 , as part of their efforts to streamline procedures for dealing with terrorism threats .
Mr. McKinnon ’s supporters say the treaty is one - sided , making it far easier for the United States to extradite people from Britain than the reverse .
Legal experts say that the treaty requires the United States to show British courts only that charges have been properly filed against an individual whose extradition it seeks , while Britain has to produce evidence in American courts to support the case it intends to bring against someone it wants returned to Britain .

More than 50 people have been killed in a series of bomb attacks in Iraq in the worst day of violence since US forces withdrew from urban areas on 30 June .
The most lethal attack was in Talafar , near Mosul , where at least 34 people were killed and more than 60 injured in a double suicide bombing .
In Baghdad , two attacks at markets left at least 16 dead .
Several other people were killed in smaller attacks in the capital and in southern Kirkuk .
The BBC's Gabriel Gatehouse in Baghdad says the attacks raise questions about whether Iraqi forces are capable of guaranteeing security without US support .
Those who want to derail the handover from US to Iraqi forces now appear to be testing the ground to see how much room they have for manoeuvre , he adds .
' Policeman targeted '
The attacks in Talafar , which is populated mainly by members of the Turkmen ethnic minority , happened at about 0730 ( 0430 GMT ) and in quick succession .
First , a suicide bomber - who was reportedly wearing a police uniform - detonated his explosives vest .
The second blast followed as people gathered at the scene of the first explosion .
In pictures : Deadly bombings
The target of the attack appears to have been a member of the local security forces , our correspondent says .
He says this area of northern Iraq is rapidly becoming Iraq 's most dangerous region .
On Wednesday , two explosions near Shia mosques in Mosul killed at least nine people and wounded many more .
In Sadr City , a Shia area of Baghdad , two roadside bombs exploded in a market , killing at least seven people and wounding dozens .
The bombs were reportedly placed in rubbish piles in the area .
Later , a double bomb attack at a market in a Sunni neighbourhood in northern Baghdad killed nine and injured 35 .
In another attack in the capital , a roadside bomb blast killed one civilian in the central Karrada area , police said .
They said the attack targeted a convoy of Iraq 's Central Bank governor , who was unhurt .
US combat troops pulled out from Iraqi towns and cities last week .
US President Barack Obama has described the handover to Iraqis as a milestone , warning that the country 's leaders would face " hard choices " on security and politics .
The withdrawal came ahead of the full departure of US forces by 2012 .

I ’ve always liked rest stops along the interstates .
They are a study in what humans will settle for after sitting in a car for seven hours .
Suddenly , a soppy hamburger that has been sitting under a heat lamp passes for a meal .
And the bathroom , where the soap is out and the toilet paper is only 1 - ply , and that smells like the monkey house , seems like an oasis after chugging all those Cokes .
The other thing I like about rest stops are the sundries , the small soaps , the beef jerky in camouflage - colored bags , and the remarkable selection of Loggins & Messina cassette tapes .
And in fancier rest stops , there are even restaurants , the one with the Bob ’s Big Boy we found in Delaware .
We took a New Year ’s trip up the coast to Atlantic City , New Jersey , and one of the first things on my itinerary was to visit the Bob ’s Big Boy along the way , a location whose existence I have silently committed to memory during other road trips .
What I really hoped for was to find some Big Boy swag , like a bank or a keychain , or the Holy Grail , a Big Boy Doll .
He would have sat nicely on the shelf with the Shoney ’s Bear .
The problem is , this Bob ’s Big Boy is n’t even a real one .
It is n’t listed on their website under locations , and does n’t list any of their specialty sandwiches on their menu .
In fact , the menu itself looked like it was printed with Print Shop for DOS .
This should have been the first red flag .
This is a restaurant that franchised the Big Boy ’s name and likeness , but does n’t serve its actual food , and is n’t even recognized by the actual company .
This should have been the second red flag .
But since we were at a rest stop , I was n’t complaining .
I was pretty happy to accept a level of skeeviness in exchange for a chance to eat in a restaurant with a nine - foot Big Boy at the front door .
But somehow , this place seemed to out - skeeve even my lowest standards .
I shuddered at the way the name of the restaurant was hot glued to the wallpaper in Family Feud font .
The writer in me cringed at the apostrophe missing in Bob’s .
Then there was the showcase –generally used to show off the desserts , enticing you into a slice of apple crumble or cheesecake–but here , the only thing offered was a display of dusty plastic fruit .
Our waitress took our beverages and pointed to the buffet , informing us that it was only $ 8.49 “ if ya want that . ”
Then she walked away , presumably to get our drinks .
She did n’t do the chatty thing .
She was very much a woman who was n’t about to deal with bullshit .
She was probably used to truckers and other crazed folk who came in off the highway .
She did n’t even wear the uniform of white slacks .
Instead , she wore cream - colored Mom- jeans , likely from the No Boundaries ( NoBo ) table at Wal - Mart .
This is the kind of woman you would n’t cross , the kind who would n’t let anything prevent her cigarette break .
We asked no questions but declined the buffet without hesitation .
I went up to peruse the buffet anyway .
I came back to the table sheepishly , and begged to borrow the camera from the girlfriend .
She said taking pictures of a buffet at a rest stop would be embarrassing and weird , but I insisted it would be photojournalism .
There were too many people slopping food onto their plates , so I had to wait approximately fourteen hours to get up there and snap a few pictures .
I waited for grandma ’s palsy hand to get some shreds of salad on her plate , and for the girl in the Adidas jumpsuit to pile up her plate with drumsticks .
People kept getting up refill their plates with the gruel , and I just wanted to take pictures like any reasonable person would .
Finally , I got my chance to take some pictures :
Pop quiz : is it pudding or gravy ?
I ’d like to keep the mystery alive about whether that ’s pudding or gravy , but for those of you just dying to know the truth , I ’ll reveal the answer in the comments section of this post .
Then there was this appetizing trough of peas and carrots , drowned in a tank of water .
I was n’t super hungry by the time I sat back down , but the food came out in record time .
Almost like it had been sitting back there already , just waiting for us to order it .
My lunch was a grilled cheese , while the girlfriend ordered some sort of fried fish thing with a ball of white stuff .
Another pop quiz .
Is that coleslaw !?!
Or is it a scoop of cottage cheese with bits of carrot in it ?
And what was up with the chariot of iceberg lettuce it arrived on ?
To add color to the plate , to jazz it up a bit ?
The mystery scoop remained untouched but I ’ll reveal its name in the comments …. the suspense !
Well I did manage to find one piece of take home swag , a coloring page for kids , and it does not disappoint :
BIG BOY LOVES LITTLE PEOPLE .
EPILOGUE :
A few hours after writing this post , I came down with the worst food poisioning I ever had in my life .
I ’m not talking about a little bit of stomach pain and barfing once or twice .
I ’m talking about scrub - down - the - cruise - ship - with - bleach caliber food - poisoning .
I ’m talking about when they warn kids in schools about saying no to drugs , they should also warn them to say no to Big Boy .
If you are a politician or celeb — then this is the Mercedes - Benz for you .
The Mercedes - Benz E- Guard VR4 is not your regular W212 E - Class – it ’s been beefed up substantially to give extra protection to the occupant inside , but the extra protection are all hidden and cannot be seen by the naked eye .
It starts off as a regular E - Class chassis , made to regular series production standards .
All the extra protection helps the E - Guard conform to VR4 protection class .
BMW ’s “ Security ” series of armored cars also conform to this same specification .
This means it can withstand handgun bullets of up to .44 Magnum in calibre at random angles of fire and not just via certain angles , to provide the most realistic protection possible .
Runflat tyres in 17 inch size are used for additional protection ( all BMWs except some M cars have this as standard ) , ensuring the car can still go at up to 50 km and 80 km / h speed in case attackers damage the tires .
OFFICIAL PRESS RELEASE :
New E - Guard models from Mercedes - Benz : Original bodyshell with a network of protective features
Stuttgart – Shortly after the market launch of the new E - Class , Mercedes - Benz is also offering the world ’s most successful business saloon as a specially protected E - Guard model .
This is mainly distinguishable from the standard model by a network of intelligently conceived protective features of special steel , which are invisibly integrated beneath the otherwise identical body .
This protective cocoon also includes all - round polycarbonate glazing .
Accordingly the new E - Guard Saloon offers its occupants effective protection against the increasing worldwide risk of criminal attack in the street .
With this new Guard model , Mercedes - Benz is continuing its eight decades of expertise in the design and production of special protection vehicles .
As is usual at Mercedes - Benz , the special requirements for the special protection version of the E - Class were already taken into consideration by the developers at the specification stage .
The new E - Guard is subject to the same bodyshell processes as a regular production model , which means that structural strength , dimensional accuracy , corrosion protection and outstanding paint quality are guaranteed to series production standards .
All - road protection against criminal attack in the street
During the next stage , highly experienced and specially trained experts install the precisely formed protective elements , which exactly fit the contours of the bodyshell without encroaching on the interior space .
The result is a comprehensively protected passenger cell of special , high - strength steels and aramide components , which are complemented with highly resistant polycabonate glazing of attractive visual appearance .
All these measures are invisible to the naked eye .
The extremely stringent Mercedes - Benz guidelines are applied by the production specialists to ensure complete quality control at all times .
Despite the high level of special protection , the comfort - related advantages of the new E - Class are fully retained .
This applies equally to the generous spaciousness of this fully - fledged five - seater , the spatial acoustics , the sun protection and the lighting / control functions .
The rear window is heated , and the power windows on the driver and front passenger sides are fully retractable .
Efficient power windows are also available for the rear .
Optional extras include an emergency alarm system that causes the headlamps to flash and sounds an alarm at the touch of a button in the event of a threat .
An intercom system allows communication between the protected passenger cell and the outside world .
In addition the new E - Guard features the numerous , innovative assistance systems of the new E - Class .
The new E - Guard meets the stringent requirements for High - Protection according to protection class VR4 ( formerly B4 ) and more .
This means that the vehicle is able to withstand handgun bullets of up to .44 Magnum in calibre — at random angles of fire , to provide the most realistic protection possible .
The E - Guard therefore offers outstanding protection against criminal attacks in the street , as has been verified and certificated by an internationally recognised test institute .
Underbody armour is also available on request .
This makes the entire underfloor area of the passenger cell resistant to attack with a DM51 hand - grenade .
Modified suspension plus adapted control and restraint systems
The suspension and brakes are adapted to suit the increased weight caused by the protection features .
The E - Guard is equipped with a special Level II version of the AIRMATIC air suspension system as standard .
The electronic control and restraint systems that assist the driver in critical situations have been specifically adapted to suit the different parameters versus the standard model .
The car is fitted with 17 - inch wheels and run-flat tyres designed for a maximum speed of 240 km/h as standard .
With the tyres deflated , the vehicle is still able to cover up to 50 kilometres at a speed of 80 km/h to enable its occupants to escape from the danger area in the event of a corresponding attack .
Extensive test marathon
Like all the series - production vehicles , the new E - Guard Saloon was subjected to extensive testing under tough conditions during its development .
This included endurance testing on simulated rough tracks , braking tests on Alpine passes , climatic tests at extreme temperatures , long - term corrosion tests and crash tests .
Like all Guard models , the E - Guard is covered by the full Mercedes - Benz warranty and service terms – in addition to the integrated , ex factory protection , this is another important advantage over vehicles with retrofitted special protection .
Family - friendly saloon with special protection
The new E - Guard is available in three engine variants , with an option of the basic ELEGANCE line or the AVANTGARDE line .
The E 500 and E 350 , as well as the diesel - powered E 350 CDIBlueEFFICIENCY , are designed as five - seaters with a boot capacity of 540 litres and a high payload of up to 550 kilograms , which means they are fully suitable for day - to - day and family use .
PORTSMOUTH , N.H. ( AP ) --
At first , New Hampshire lobsterman Bill Marconi thought he had caught a shiny blue beer can in his trap .
It turns out it was a rare , cobalt - blue lobster .
The 52 - year - old lobsterman was out hauling 400 traps with his son Wednesday when he snared the 1½ - pound lobster in between his dock and the Isle of Shoals , about six miles off the coast .
New England Aquarium Research Director Mike Tlusty tells Foster 's Daily Democrat only one in 5 million lobsters are blue .
Tlusty said blue lobsters are different in that they are better at processing astaxanthin , an antioxidant with a red pigment derived from algae .
The substance bonds with proteins in the lobster 's shell , resulting in the blue pigment .
Marconi donated his lobster to the Seacoast Science Center .

Microsoft wants us to move away from the term " netbook " , instead referring to the tiny , cheap laptops , which the company says demand recognition for handling more than just browsing , as — brace yourselves — " low cost small notebook PCs " , according to Digitimes .
Sorry , Intel !
Advertisement
Steven Guggenheimer , general manager of Application Platform & Development Marketing , outlined the plan in a speech yesterday at Computex .
The theory behind the push , according to the report , is tied up with Microsoft 's overstrict definition of " netbook " , as gleaned from Windows 7 Starter Edition 's alleged maximum specs .
Advertisement
The thinking is , I guess , that Microsoft would look bad for deeming one notebook as eligible for the discounted OS and not another , when the only difference between the two is an inch in screen size or a extra stick of RAM .
By changing the term from " netbook " to the more descriptive , performance - aware " low cost small notebook PC , " they can base the slim version of Windows 7 around that term 's definition — which they are free to write — and avoid clashing with the public 's broad preconceptions about what a netbook is .
Microsoft is planning to outline this plan in more detail today , but from here it looks a little silly .
Microsoft can construct as many internal device categories as it wants , but to customers , a netbook will still be a netbook , and Windows 7 Starter Edition will be unreasonably exclusive .

Pope Benedict XVI has decided to wade into territory which he has no understanding or expertise : the global economy .
The New York Times reports that the pope is now calling for a “ New World Economic Order ” *
VATICAN CITY — Pope Benedict XVI on Tuesday called for a radical rethinking of the global economy , criticizing a growing divide between rich and poor and urging the establishment of a “ world political authority ” to oversee the economy and work for the “ common good . ”
He criticized the current economic system , “ where the pernicious effects of sin are evident , ” and urged financiers in particular to “ rediscover the genuinely ethical foundation of their activity .
I have to ask the question to my Catholic friends who believe in Papal infallibility that also happen to believe in free market capitalism : how do you square the two philosophies ?
( Argument withdrawn ; I am by no means infallible and was lacking in my understanding of this concept )
The article continues :
In many ways , the document is a somewhat puzzling cross between an anti-globalization tract and a government white paper , another indication that the Vatican does not comfortably fit into traditional political categories of right and left .
“ There are paragraphs that sound like Ayn Rand , next to paragraphs that sound like ‘ The Grapes of Wrath . ’
That ’s quite intentional , ” Vincent J. Miller , a theologian at the University of Dayton , a Catholic institution in Ohio , said in a telephone interview .
“ He ’ll wax poetically about the virtuous capitalist , but then he ’ll give you this very clear analysis of the ways in which global capital and the shareholder system cause managers to focus on short term good at the expense of the community , of workers , of the environment . ”
Indeed , sometimes Benedict sounds like an old - school European socialist , lamenting the decline of the social welfare state and praising the “ importance ” of labor unions to protect workers .
Without stable work , he notes , people lose hope and tend not to get married and have children .
Sorry padre , you ca n’t have it both ways .
If you truly believe the Communist / Socialist model is morally superior to Capitalism ( an admittedly selfish system by honest supporters such as Ayn Rand ) just come out and say so !
If one honestly reads the scriptures , one will see that the teachings of Christ are much more in line with Karl Marx than Adam Smith .
But wait , it gets worse …
Benedict also calls for a reform of the United Nations so that there can be a unified “ global political body ” that allows the less powerful of the earth to have a voice , and calls on rich nations to help less fortunate ones .
In other words , the U.N. should force the citizens of the most efficient and productive nations at gun point to give money to people in nations who are less efficient and less productive in large part because they subscribe to the philosophy of the Pope : “ From each according to his ability , to each according to his need . ”
There ’s a word for this ; it ’s called extortion .
* So does this mean that perhaps Pope Benedict XVI is the AntiChrist ?
Peru 's army is poised to deploy in the Amazon rainforest to lift blockades across rivers and roads by indigenous people opposed to oil , gas , logging and mining projects .
The government has authorised the military to move into remote provinces where a state of emergency has been declared in the wake of a month - long stand - off between indigenous people and police .
President Alan Garcia said the state had the right and responsibility to develop mineral and hydrocarbon wealth to benefit all Peruvians .
" We have to understand that when there are resources like oil , gas and timber , they do n't belong only to the people who had the fortune to be born there because that would mean more than half of Peru 's territory belongs to a few thousand people . "
In the past two years the centre - right government has signed deals with multinationals to open swaths of rainforest , including a £ 1.3 bn agreement last month with the Anglo - French oil company Perenco .
Indigenous groups , backed by environmentalists and Catholic bishops , have protested that the developments will devastate the area 's ecology and their culture .
About 65 tribes have mobilised 30,000 people to disrupt roads , waterways and pipelines , leading to skirmishes with police .
Up to 41 vessels serving energy companies are stuck along jungle rivers , paralysed by the protests , one private sector source told Reuters .
One of the most tense areas is along the Napo river in northern Peru , said Survival International , a London - based rights advocacy group .
" After local indigenous people blockaded the river with a nylon cable , a naval gunboat and three boats belonging to Perenco broke through the blockade , sinking some of the protesters ' canoes in the process . "
The National Organisation of the Amazon Indigenous people of Peru said last week 's declaration of a state of emergency , which suspended some constitutional rights in four jungle provinces , amounted to a declaration of war by the government .
The group responded by calling for an " insurgency " but retracted the term on Saturday after being threatened with 10 years in jail for sedition .
Protests will continue but within the rule of law , it said .
The Peruvian rainforest is the largest swath of Amazon outside Brazil .
According to one study oil , gas and timber deals would cover an estimated 70 % of the forest .
The government says such developments are needed to boost economic growth and state revenues in one of South America 's poorest countries .
The projects , which could turn Peru into a net oil exporter , are in line with a free trade deal with the United States .
Alberto Pizango , an indigenous leader , said the tribes – who claim the forest as ancestral land – were not seeking a blanket ban on projects .
" What we want is development from our perspective . "
Each side has blamed the other for breakdown in negotiations .

A virtual reality exhibit is giving visitors the extreme ranges of sight and hearing that many animals have .
The so - called " immersive " exhibit shows what it might be like to see with birds ' ultraviolet vision or hear with whales ' ultra - low frequency hearing .
The researchers say the project aims to demonstrate for the public all the sensing ranges animals experience that are described in scientific literature .
The exhibit is on display at the annual Siggraph conference in New Orleans , US .
The light that humans can see and sounds they can hear are just a small sliver of the total range of those experienced by animals .
Many creatures can both make and perceive sounds at higher and lower ranges than we can hear - dogs ' perception of ultrasound is a well - known example .
Several animal species are known to be able to perceive light at extreme ranges ; birds can see ultraviolet light and their plumage is often highly reflective in this range .
We hope this will generate greater interest in what 's out there in one 's own back yard
Carol LaFayette Texas A&M University Predators such as rattlesnakes , on the other hand , are sensitive to infrared light , seeing the " heat " given off by their prey .
Carol LaFayette of Texas A&M University 's visualisation department and her team wanted to make those senses available to the public .
" If you were walking through the woods and you had the ability to see in ultraviolet , for instance , things like birds or fungi might stand out in very colourful ways , " she told BBC News .
" These species are n't very exotic , they 're all over the place .
" There is a wealth of information out there in scientific research that is difficult to access and present .
Our project makes these fascinating stories accessible to a wider range of people . "
The team consulted a number of researchers , gathering together a candidate list of species and even some infra- and ultrasound recordings of animals in the wild .
Deep immersion
The system comprises five large projection screens designed in a semicircle .
The virtual reality scene is based loosely on Cocos Island , west of Costa Rica , and visitors to the exhibit can wander through the island 's forests or swim in its tropical waters , navigating with the aid of a modified Nintendo Wii game controller .
The view of a bird 's nest is different in visible , infrared , and ultraviolet
They can switch between ranges of sounds or sights that they might see .
An ultraviolet setting paints a picture rich with both normal colour and reflections we can't normally see .
Visualisation expert Fred Parke has designed the system such that it corrects for perspective as users navigate the space .
The programme allows visitors to hear the infrasound vocalisations of whales or the ultrasound clicks of tiger moths .
The effect , with the aid of surround - system built into the exhibit , is a sense of total immersion in the environment , the researchers said .
The sounds can be simply scaled in terms of frequency to a band that humans can hear ; " seeing " in ultraviolet , however is a little more difficult .
Colours must be assigned arbitrarily to different wavelengths because we simply can't " translate " what it looks like to animals .
The researchers are working to integrate infrared vision into the exhibit , and are considering how to tackle sensory modes that humans do n't even have - such as sharks ' ability to sense electric fields .
" There are things that we can scale , that we can understand because they are things that we can see or hear - then there are things we do n't even know how they can be sensed .
That 's a really fascinating area , " Ms LaFayette said .
The team hopes the idea takes root and imagines the potential for a " live feed " of audio and video from corners of the globe both near and far .
Subscriptions to a real - time experience could pay for the purchase of land for wildlife , they said .
" The immersive system ties interest in the environment to knowledge gained through scientific research , " Ms LaFayette explained .
" We hope this will generate greater interest in what 's out there in one 's own back yard . "
The Siggraph ( Special Interest Group on Graphics and Interactive Techniques ) annual conference runs in New Orleans from 3 to 7 August .

Since the debut of broadcast television in this country more than 50 years ago , millions of Canadians have grown to expect free access to local television signals .
While the mechanism for accessing those ad - or taxpayer - supported broadcasts has evolved from rooftop antennae to cable and satellite distribution , access has consistently been free ( cable obviously charges for access , but it does not pay for carriage of local signals ) .
Local TV News : Who Should Pay ?

Announcements , Events & more from Tyee and select partners John Horton ’s Paintings Preserve History .
His Seamanship Saves Lives
Meet the fascinating Order of BC winner who also happens to be a Tyee supporter .
Last week , Canada 's broadcast regulator issued a decision that will bring the era of free local television to an end for many Canadians .
Whether through the elimination of local over - the - air broadcasts or via additional cable or satellite charges to cover a new fee - for - carriage system , free is out and new fees are in .
The changes are the result of two policy decisions by the Canadian Radio - television and Telecommunications Commission .
First , the CRTC set the ground rules for the digital transition of Canadian broadcasting by determining that many Canadian communities are likely to lose their over - the - air signal as part of the change .
We 're late to the digital reality
In just over two years , Canada is scheduled to bring its television broadcast system into the digital world with a mandated conversion from analog to digital .
The move is long overdue ( the United States completed its transition last month ) and will bring considerable benefits by introducing greater broadcast efficiencies and freeing up valuable spectrum that can be used for new wireless services .
Canadian broadcasters have resisted investing in the new digital transmitters , however , claiming that the additional costs are difficult to justify given the shrinking market share of over - the - air broadcasting .
With less than 10 percent of Canadians still relying on over - the - air signals ( most use a broadcast distributor such as a cable or satellite provider ) , the broadcasters argued that the digital transition was economically viable only in major markets .
The CRTC largely agreed , ruling that broadcasters are expected to convert to digital transmitters only in major markets , which it defined as " the national capital and all provincial and territorial capital cities , as well as markets either served by multiple originating stations ( including CBC stations ) or with populations greater than 300,000 . "
In Ontario , that covers Toronto , Hamilton , Barrie , Ottawa , London , Windsor , and Kitchener .
It excludes several important communities such as Kingston , Sudbury , and Thunder Bay .
Moreover , nationally every province has its share of exclusions , including Kelowna , Abbotsford , Red Deer , and Brandon .
Fee for carriage wins the day
As some communities face the prospect of losing their over - the - air signal , cable and satellite subscribers should prepare for paying for local signals .
After twice rejecting requests for a fee - for - carriage system for local broadcasts , last week the CRTC reversed course .
Cable companies and their subscribers pay for premium channels such as TSN or CNN , but local signals are carried without compensation , resulting in a broadcaster - led campaign in support of the imposition of new fees for carrying the local signal .
The Commission did not set a fee , but it did order both the broadcasters and broadcast distributors to negotiate a settlement .
If the two sides are unable to do so , it promised to arbitrate a solution .
The policy reversal -- coming just days after a House of Commons committee declined to establish fee - for - carriage -- is sure to set off a battle between broadcasters who argue that the fees are needed for their long - term sustainability and the cable and satellite providers , who view it as a cash - grab that could add $ 6 per month onto many cable bills .
As that fight unfolds , it is Canadian consumers who find themselves stuck in the middle , with some paying more for the same services and others about to lose access to broadcasts altogether .
Merkel pinned the medal to the chest of Master Sergeant Alexander Dietzen Germany 's Chancellor , Angela Merkel , has presented four soldiers with the country 's new medal for bravery , the first to be awarded since World War II .
The Cross of Honour for Bravery features a golden cross with an eagle in the centre , held on a black , red and gold ribbon with oak leaves .
It is the Bundeswehr 's first decoration for bravery since the Iron Cross was shunned due to its WWII association .
The soldiers are being honoured for their bravery in Afghanistan in 2008 .
The four risked their lives to aid those wounded in a suicide attack near Kunduz that left two soldiers and five children dead , the defence ministry said in a statement on its website .
" Despite burning vehicles and exploding munitions , the soldiers attempted to rescue their comrades and Afghan civilians , " it added .
The German army did not previously have a bravery medal Germany has some 7,200 troops currently serving abroad , including 3,830 in Afghanistan as part of the International Security Assistance Force ( Isaf ) .
Ulrich Kirsch , chairman of the Federal Armed Forces Federation , a union representing German soldiers , told ARD television that the medal was fitting recognition of the military 's increasing role .
" The soldiers are so close to death and injury - that 's not the situation in other jobs , " he said .
" We consider this honour absolutely appropriate . "
Before the creation of the Cross of Honour for Bravery , the Bundeswehr 's four existing decorations were given only for " loyal services and in appreciation of exemplary soldierly acquittal of duty " .
The Iron Cross was established originally as a Prussian military honour by King Frederick Wilhelm III in 1813 .
The medal was later awarded as a top honour to German servicemen during both world wars , but was abandoned in 1945 .

President Obama ’s plans to reform the healthcare system in U.S. have taken over the headlines in the past several weeks .
Doctors , economists , insurance executives , public health experts — all of them are being afforded the chance add their two cents on how to fix our broken healthcare system .
The voices that are strikingly absent , though , are those of the agricultural community .
What , you may ask , does agriculture have to do with overhauling the healthcare system ?
My answer– everything .
My awakening to the connection between agriculture , social justice , and health came during a semester abroad in South Africa .
There , during a stint in a public hospital in a small city surrounded by rural territories , I watched as HIV - positive mothers waited for hours each month — some having traveled two days in packed vans — to receive a free box of nutrient - dense foods from the government .
Those mothers were , without exception , Black and poor .
Few of them had access to land as their families did before apartheid , and thus their ability to provide good food for themselves and their families had been systematically stripped from them .
Today , with the AIDS epidemic spreading like wildfire across the country , the poor ’s labor force — and thus earned income — has fallen sharply , making it difficult to afford food at market .
As malnutrition and acute hunger have become more common among poor populations in South Africa , HIV and tuberculosis spread faster and faster , as both diseases are easily passed to those with compromised immune systems from inadequate nutrition .
What does South Africa ’s social and medical plight have anything do with with healthcare in America ?
We ’re a first world country , after all .
Indeed , and although our labor force may not be dwindling from HIV / AIDS and tuberculosis as South Africa ’s is , we have our own epidemics to deal with , foremost among them obesity and all the diseases it brings with it such as Type II diabetes and severe heart problems .
America ’s children are strung out on high fructose corn syrup — concealed in nearly every food in our supermarkets — and thus cannot concentrate in school or develop properly , making it difficult for them to succeed academically and , subsequently , in the job market .
According to study after study ( or firsthand experience from spending an hour in any public emergency room ) , the groups most affected by diet - related health problems are the poor and non-white .
Eva Salber , one of the pioneers of the community health movement once wrote , “ diseases resulting from societal inequities ca n’t be cured by medical care alone — no matter its excellence . ”
One of the most blaring inequities in our society today lies beyond lack of access to medical treatment in the inaccessibility of the means by which to prevent ill - health in the first place : good food .
Get the latest articles in your inbox .
The effects of our broken food system affect all of us , even the small percentage of Americans who choose — and can afford — to eat a healthy , safe diet .
Treating chronic diseases is a major drain on our healthcare system an tax dollars , as is true in South Africa , and even equitable and accessible medical care for all will not provide a silver bullet fix to our population ’s deteriorating health .
If we are ever to enact lasting change on our health as a population , we all need healthy food to be accessible and affordable .
Not the kind of healthy food that announces itself as such with a flashy label on a vacuum - packed wrapper , but the kind that comes from an ecologically and economically sound agricultural system , one that produces vegetables , fruits , grains , and animal products , not simply commodities to be processed into food products .
We — individually and collectively — need real food to attain health .
America has watched , somewhat wide - eyed and dumbfounded , as a modern “ back to the land ” movement has emerged .
Wealthy white college students , the ones have traditionally vied for summer internships in law , medicine , and finance — are increasingly swapping suits for dirty jeans and a spot on a farm crew for the summer .
The number of farmers markets has exploded .
And even among the most under - served communities in the country , the number of community gardens , community supported agriculture ( CSA ) operations , and community kitchens are growing faster than summer zucchini .
But we ca n’t allow the movement towards systematic change in our food system to stop there .
Without policy in place to support a new generation of farmers who have economic incentives to grow food for consumption rather than producing commodity crops ( i.e. soy beans , corn , and wheat ) for the corporate processing industry , and until we can make procuring farmland in rural areas and green space in densely populated communities less cost prohibitive , we will never be able to produce the amount of healthy food we need to support a healthy population .
We can argue until we ’re blue in the face about the merits of publicly - versus privately - funded healthcare .
We can ration medical services or not .
The quality versus quantity debate as it relates to medical care can rage on for years .
And we can calculate the potential cost of every permutation we come up with .
But unless we begin to address root causes of ill health in this country — hunger , poverty , social injustice , and an agricultural system that feeds corporate greed rather than the citizens of this country — the costly burden on our health and thus our medical system will never diminish .
President Obama and members of Congress , take a hint from the First Lady and her wildly popular garden and invite the farmers to the table .
Our nation ’s health depends on it .
April 13 , 1992 .
An anti-nuclear activist rushed a stage where former President Reagan was speaking , grabbed a large glass statue and smashed it .
Pieces of glass hit Reagan in the head , but he was n't hurt .
The protester was Richard Paul Springer 41 , of Arcadia , California .
The flames were tearing through the city now , entire city blocks aflame , apartment towers and offices alike belching thick black smoke into the night sky .
Brad wiped the soot away from his eyes and looked around the street , shotgun in his right hand , and gripping his left was his son .
“ OK , follow me , if we can get to the bridge there ’s a car rental place there ” he said , moving away from the buildings doorway and out into the street .
He had learned quickly over the last few hours to stay well away from the edge of the street .
As the first reports of infected had leaked out onto the local news Brad had paid it little attention .
The first quarantined building was on the other side of town and nothing for the general population to worry about .
Even as the fire had broken out within the building , captured on camera and beamed across the city , Brad had settled down on the couch with a beer and that mornings newspaper .
He had only looked up at the TV when the first burning man had walked out of the building and attacked the nearest firefighter .
He had sat there fixated as the walking pillar of fire crossed the street toward another firefighter , ignoring the gunshots and bullets thudding into it from the nearby police .
He had watched in morbid fascination , as more human torches exited the building , unhurriedly walking toward the police who had begun to flee the scene or crossing the street , following the crowd of onlookers who had fled back into the opposite building .
The flames had quickly spread after that , matched only in speed by the spread of the infected across the city .
Within hours the city was aflame , the streets were clogged with stationary cars , many alight and public transport had come to a complete halt .
Brad and his son had gathered up a few supplies and headed out into the glowing night as they had watched the neighboring apartment building go up in flames .
Brad shut his eyes and forced the memory from his mind , trying not to picture the figures struggling in the windows across the street , trying to fight back against the attackers that had poured through their apartment doors , seemingly unhurt by bullets and fire alike .
He stepped over another prone body , probably the twentieth jumper he had seen within the past hour and strode down the middle of the street toward the bridge .
Approaching the giant structure he could see a blockade of police cars and SWAT vans across all six lanes of the bridges mouth .
He waved as a bright spotlight was turned toward him and slowed his walk , holding his arms out away from his body and letting the shotgun dangle from his outstretched finger tips .
As he slowly stepped forward the light suddenly swung away from him and lit up a number of people to Brads left .
Turning to look at them his stomach turned to stone as the first one stumbled toward him , a female , whose left arm was completely missing and whose clothes and skin was charred and torn away in multiple places .
Panicking Brad pushed his son away from him toward the police line and took aim at the nightmarish figure bearing down on him .
He leveled the shotgun and pulled the trigger .
The gun roared tearing a huge chunk of the attacker ’s torso away .
Still she kept coming at him .
Brad pumped the shotgun and fired another round , this time hitting her squarely in the chest , knocking her back several paces before she began to lumber toward him .
He pumped the gun again and fired another round , snapping her left knee in half and sending her spinning to the ground .
Brad looked up as she began pulling herself toward him , to see another disfigured man lurching his way .
He squealed , pumped the shotgun , aimed higher , pulled the trigger and watched as the top portion of the man ’s skull shattered under the impact , sending a plume of blood and hair into the night air .
Brad stepped backward as the lifeless body crashed in a heap at his feet .
With a lunge the crawling woman grabbed his leg , pulled in close and bit down hard on Brad ’s boot .
With a cry of pain Brad slammed the stock into the her head , ramming it into the hard pavement and leaving broken teeth protruding from his now bleeding foot .
He reversed the shotgun , pumped it a final time and fired , point blank , at the base of her skull .
The blast tore through the bone , mulching the brain and sent shrapnel in every direction as the buckshot hit the pavement .
Brad screamed as hot fragments tore through his leg and already hurt foot .
Limping backwards he spotted more figures moving out of the shadows toward him .
He turned and began to limp toward the police line and the silhouetted figure of his son , anxiously waiting for him .
As he approached a heavily armed officer approached him “ Sir , were you bitten ? ” he asked .
“ Uhh , no , no its just shrapnel from the shotgun ” Brad replied back , his voice tinged with fear and his mind racing at what would happen if they suspected he had been bitten .
“ Alright , good ” responded the officer , his attention already shifting to the oncoming group “ Get over the bridge and find a paramedic , they should be able to help you out ”
Brad nodded , grabbed his sons arm and began to make his way toward the bridge .
As they made their way across they could hear the officer barking orders and gunshots ringing out as they opened fire on the onrushing group .
Half way across the bridge he turned to his son and pulled the small one round pistol from his sock “ I want you to have this son .
Do n’t be afraid to use it , no matter what happens or who you need to use it on .
No matter who it is , do n’t hesitate .
Do you understand ? ”
The young teenager looked up at his father as he took the pistol offered to him “ Yes dad ” he replied .

At a time when we Americans may abandon health care reform because it supposedly is “ too expensive , ” how is it that we can afford to imprison people like Curtis Wilkerson ?
Mr. Wilkerson is serving a life sentence in California  for stealing a $ 2.50 pair of socks .
As The Economist noted recently , he already had two offenses on his record ( both for abetting robbery at age 19 ) , and so the “ three strikes ” law resulted in a life sentence .
This is unjust , of course .
But considering that California spends almost $ 49,000 annually per prison inmate , it ’s also an extraordinary waste of money .
Astonishingly , many politicians seem to think that we should lead the world in prisons , not in health care or education .
The United States is anomalous among industrialized countries in the high proportion of people we incarcerate ; likewise , we stand out in the high proportion of people who have no medical care  and partly as a result , our health care outcomes such as life expectancy and infant mortality are unusually poor .
Discovered last month in a UK barley field , this crop circle appears to be a jellyfish .
But intrepid crop circle analysts have discovered that it predicts a devastating solar storm on July 7 .
And they have diagrams to prove it .
Advertisement
Let 's start with some plain facts .
A commenter named Harold Stryderight on Cropcircleconnector.com explains it all to you :
Whenever a severe solar storm impacts directly on Earth , then our planetary magnetic field or " magnetosphere " changes into the general shape of a " jellyfish " .
That seems to be what those crop artists were telling us at Wayland 's Smithy on May 29 , 2009 .

When looking at this lovely crop circle of a jellyfish , this does seem to be the obvious conclusion to reach .
If it 's a jellyfish , it must be the magnetosphere .
I mean that 's just common sense .
Also , we have a helpful diagram showing how similar the jellyfish really is to this atmospheric phenomenon .
But who would be satisfied with just figuring out the jellyfish / magnetosphere correlation ?
Nobody , that 's who .
So Stryderight has delved deeper , analyzing every aspect of the jellyfish to determine what the exact date will be of the solar storm bent on destroying our atmosphere .
He explains :
The new crop picture shows also seven " eclipse " symbols in its central tail ( white numbers 1 to 7 ) , as well as seven streamers hanging off below ( yellow numbers 1 to 7 ) .
Both of those features suggest that a solar storm may impact Earth on July 7 , 2009 , as has already been suggested by several other crop pictures from April or May .
The new crop picture also shows a small , horizontal , four - circle band just between its head and its long tail ( blue arrows , left or right above ) .
That feature closely resembles a crop picture from July 20 , 2008 which told us about eclipses .
Indeed , the suggested date of July 7 , 2009 for an upcoming solar storm will be a penumbral lunar eclipse .

So true .
Why did n't I think of that ?
Because I am not a trained crop circle analyst .
I just do n't have the background .
Here is another helpful diagram to make this all clear .
Advertisement
There is apparently a third possibility for what this crop circle means , and I 'm really confused about how it relates to the sun and our atmosphere and stuff like that .
I mean , I get that the human body is like the solar system in miniature .
Maybe our expert can enlighten me .
Another crop circle analyst named Sol Ar writes :
The tentacles are non-symmetrical and seem to depict an organic , moving layer or sheath around the jellyfish .
Their purpose is protection .
Once activated the 12 - point chakra system , through the crown ‘ doorway ' , will open human Beings to multi-dimensionality and envelop the physical body in an ethereal , protective shell .
The tentacles also seem to suggest our awareness or consciousness flowing freely into the unified field .
We are on a wondrous journey of self - discovery as we awaken to our essence and full potential .
Advertisement
I see .
So basically after we recover from a massive solar storm that destroys our atmosphere , kills all our communications satellites , and takes down the power grid , we 're going to awaken our potential .
Because we 're all going to be protected by an ethereal shell , which is like +10 armor that protects against photonic incursion .
You know what I love about crop circles ?
They always make me feel great .

By David Paul Kuhn - August 3 , 2009
Fully 35 percent of Democrats believe George W. Bush had advance knowledge of the 9/11 terrorist attacks .
Fully 28 percent of Republicans believe Barack Obama was n't born in the United States .
Meet the fanatical third .
The tale of two conspiracy theories is the tale of the most polarized among us .
The two statistics are based on a poll apiece .
Neither is an exact measure .
Yet , lots of liberals say take the " birther " poll on face value .
Lots of conservatives say take the " truther " poll on face value .
So let 's listen to both sides .
The unsurprising conclusion : you can't reason with arch partisans .
On Friday , I published a post wondering why the mainstream media was paying exponentially more attention to the " birther " movement now .
The 2008 campaign ended about eight months ago , after all .
The recent obsession over this fringe topic effectively blends conservatives with a fringe belief .
The end result , the media has been making conservatives look like kooks .
That 's because they are , according to many liberals who emailed me last Friday .
The polar camp , the " birthers , " sent me an even larger onslaught of emails ; many were infuriated that I had inferred they were kooks .
The liberal emailers were armed with a poll .
The Daily Kos , the mega- activist liberal blog , commisioned a Research 2000 poll that was coincidently also published last Friday .
The poll reported that only 42 percent of Republicans believe Obama was born in the United States , while 30 percent were unsure and 28 percent said he was born elsewhere .
Most striking , there was a broad similarity between that result and a Rasmussen poll taken in the spring of 2007 .
That poll found that only 39 percent of Democrats believed W. Bush did not have advance knowledge of the 9/11 terrorist attacks , while 26 percent said they were unsure and slightly more than one third of Democrats believed W. Bush knew his country was going to be attacked .
" The Paranoid Style in American Politics , " was the title of historian Richard Hofstadter 's famous Sixties essay .
" I call it the paranoid style , " he wrote , because " no other word adequately evokes the sense of heated exaggeration , suspiciousness , and conspiratorial fantasy . "
Most conspiracy theorists ' fidelity is to theory , not truth .
They tend to uphold a belief despite the facts .
The possible , however improbable , trumps the logical .
And it 's futile to attempt to disprove their belief .
It 's like debating with those who believe the world is flat .
But about one third of Democrats and Republicans want to believe the world is flat , metaphorically speaking .
Perhaps it 's that simple .
Or , do these questions really serve as nets that capture extreme partisans ?
Consider that southerners are most likely to believe Obama was born abroad .
Northeasterners are least likely .
The former is the most conservative region , the latter is the most liberal .
And it's no coincidence that nearly all Democrats believe Obama was born in the United States and nearly all Republicans believe W. Bush had no prior knowledge of the 9/11 attacks .
The disparate treatment of the two conspiracy theories is unmistakable .
More Democrats fell into the " truther " camp than Republicans fall into the " birther " camp .
But the mainstream media has covered the " birther " poll far more vigorously .
It 's easy to understand , unless one is invested in the opposing camp , why these incongruities irk the political right .
But the poll results stir up larger questions concerning our polarization .
Neither party can wholly disavow their fanatical fringe .
That fringe could , one might wager , be anywhere between a fifth to two - fifths of both major parties .
And that means , this fringe is endemic to our politics .
The culprits of our polarization are many .
Between 1960 and 2005 , one study found that ideological activist groups of all political persuasions increased sevenfold .
Gerrymandering of congressional districts has maximized liberals in liberal districts and conservatives in conservative districts .
This has left our congress - people more polarized .
Today , conservatives and liberals can join vacation tours attended by only their side of the debate or join dating services to court only the like minded .
At night , one side watches only MSNBC and the other side only Fox News .
And when people are around likeminded individuals , one study found , their viewpoints only become that much more extreme .
We are living the result .
After his first six months in office , Gallup found that only 23 percent of Republicans approved of Obama .
After six months in office , Gallup found that only 28 percent of Democrats approved of W. Bush .
Now travel back four to five decades .
After six months in office , 60 percent of Republicans approved of John F. Kennedy .
After six months in office , 51 percent of Democrats approved of Richard Nixon .
And lest we forget , Nixon and Kennedy both won by less than a percentage point .
We are ever more polarized today and so may be the conspiracies .
The less each base understands the other side perhaps the more outlandish the theories become , in order explain the hold of the other side .
A few years ago , an Emory psychologist scanned the brains of self - described partisans .
Partisans were able to notice the hypocritical statements of the opposing candidate but not the inconsistencies of their preferred candidate .
Ideology , it was determined , showed effects similar to drug addiction .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) -
The global financial crisis may morph into a second , equally virulent phase where borrowing costs rise again , hobbling an embryonic economic recovery , debilitating cash - strapped banks , and punishing investors all over again .

Early warnings signs of this scenario include surging government bond yields , a slumping U.S. dollar , and the fading of the bear market rally in U.S. stocks .
Optimists hope that a fragile two - month rally in world stock markets , a rise in U.S. Treasury yields from record lows during the depths of the crisis in late 2008 , and some less scary economic data all signal that a recovery is around the corner .
But gloomy analysts insist that thinking is delusional .
Once Credit Crisis Version 2.0 ramps up , foreign investors may punish the U.S. government for borrowing trillions of dollars too much by refusing to buy its debt until bond prices plunge to much cheaper levels .
The telling harbinger is benchmark Treasury note yields ’ surge to six - month highs around 3.75 percent this week , as investors began to balk at the record U.S. government borrowing requirement this year .
The U.S. Treasury plans to sell about $ 2 trillion in new debt this year to fund a $ 1.8 trillion fiscal deficit .
Heavy selling of U.S. dollar - denominated assets could trigger a full - blown currency crisis and usher in surging inflation , forcing mortgage rates and corporate bond yields up , undermining any rebound in economic activity .
“ The financial crisis is a downward spiral with two twists , ” said George Feiger , chief executive of Contango Capital Advisors in Berkeley , California .
First came the banking crisis and a huge contraction of credit , starting in mid-2007 which resulted in the stock market panic of 2008 which triggered the deepest U.S. recession in at least two decades .
“ Once you have got a recession you have good old - fashioned credit losses , ” Feiger said .
“ The second leg is now the consequences of the massive recession and it is just now working its way out , ” he said .
Investors , many of them foreigners who own a large chunk of the U.S. Treasury market , are steadily demanding higher yields .
The price of the historic rescues of banks , insurers , manufacturers , and securities markets , to prevent a complete collapse during the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression , has meant a record U.S. government borrowing requirement .
But by issuing so much debt , the United States risks repulsing a critical buyer : foreign central banks , who own more than a quarter of marketable U.S. Treasuries .
China recently overtook Japan as the biggest such buyer .
“ We are getting into that stage which I call ‘ the markets revenge ’ ” , said Martin Weiss , president of Weiss Research Inc. in Jupiter , Florida .
Weiss , known for his especially pessimistic views on the banking system and economy , recently published a book entitled : “ The Ultimate Depression Survival Guide ” .
“ The market attacked anyone who had the toxic assets , ” he said .
Now , foreign investors ’ primary target is the U.S. government because it has bought many of the tarnished securities from banks and some of the failing institutions itself , but the selloff will soon spread to all U.S. dollar - denominated assets , Weiss expects .
Selling could push up the 10 - year Treasury note ’s yield to about 6.0 percent Weiss warns .
For now , he urges investors to stash much of their savings in short term Treasury bills , which carry minimal interest rate risk .
Foreign investors are running out of patience with the U.S. government ’s debt issuance , he argued .
“ What happened at the end of this month is the beginning of the end of that goodwill period , ” Weiss said .
“ There could be a major near - term selloff in the dollar . ”
This month , the euro has gained nearly 7.0 percent against the U.S. dollar .
Meanwhile , the benchmark ten - year U.S. Treasury note ’s yield has surged to six - month highs around 3.75 percent , nearly doubling from its lowest level in 50 years of 2.04 percent seen last December .
Ultimately , corporate bond yields , although still at very wide yield spreads of more than four percentage points above Treasuries according to Merrill Lynch data , will also spike again , Weiss warned .
The S&P 500 stock index may fall to 500 points in this next phase of the crisis he added , down from 911 points early on Friday , he said .
On the other hand , many economists reckon the U.S. government and Federal Reserve have averted a rerun of the Great Depression by swiftly orchestrating financial rescues and monetary and fiscal stimulus to offset sagging consumer spending .
Yet even as the U.S. economy and banking system struggle to recover from two years of turmoil , Europe ’s banks are even more debilitated , raising the threat of a second global systemic crisis spreading back across the Atlantic to the United States , some analysts fear .
“ I think the most likely origins for a major crisis would be beyond our borders , ” said David Levy , chairman of the Jerome Levy Forecasting Center in Mount Kisco , New York .
With fantasy football right around the corner we though it fitting to analyze the Saints play - makers to see where they stack up among the league elite — position by position .
Quarterback : Drew Brees
Brees is a fantasy stud , ranking as the best quarterback for the upcoming fantasy season .
In 2008 Brees had 5,069 passing yards , 34 passing touchdowns and 17 pass interceptions .
He played in 16 games for a fantasy point game average of 22.21 .
Not much will change in 2009 as the Saints are clearly a team built around the passing game .
He wo n’t throw for 5000 yards again , but he has more weapons at his disposal than he can throw to , and he will turn in another dominate fantasy performance .
If your smart you ’ll take Brees off the board with your first pick .
Runningback : Reggie Bush , Pierre Thomas
Reggie Bush is a high risk , high reward pick for your fantasy team .
In 2008 Bush posted 404 rushing yards , 2 rushing touchdowns , 52 receptions , 440 receiving yards and 4 receiving touchdowns — averaging 9.84 fantasy point per game .
His hot and cold performances wreaked havoc for fantasy players last season as he failed to produce on a consistent basis .
For the second straight season he missed significant playing time due to a knee injury , only starting in ten games .
The bottom line with Bush is buyer beware , if he is available for a steal take him , other than that keep him benched if you have a better option .
Pierre Thomas may be the biggest sleeper threat for this years fantasy football season .
Thomas was able to step into a starting role late in the season after several injuries to players ahead of him on the depth chart .
He performed brilliantly in his seven game start , posting 625 rushing yards , 9 rushing touchdowns , 31 receptions , 284 receiving yards and 3 receiving touchdowns .
His fantasy points per game average was only 9.91 , but that is only due to his low number of starts at the beginning of the season .
From weeks 10 through 16 he never scored less then 10.5 fantasy points , averaging 18.6 fantasy points through this span .
With bigger names out there like Peterson , Tomlinson , and Forte , there is a good chance that Thomas will be passed over in favor of these players .
If this is the case you will look like a fantasy stud when you grab him low in the first or second round .
Do n’t sleep on him , he will have a monster year in 09 .
Widereceiver : Marques Colston , Lance Moore , Devery Henderson
Colston had an off year by his usually high standards .
He was injured in week one ’s opening game against the Buccaneers , missing the next six weeks .
Colston just was not able to find his rhythm after the long lay off , struggling through most of the remaining year .
He managed to come on strong late , posting some nice stat lines , averaging nearly 13.1 fantasy points over the last three weeks of the season .
Colston will re-emerge as a top fantasy wideout , so do n’t be afraid to burn a first round pick on the receiver .
You can almost guarantee he will post well over a thousand yards and double digit touchdowns .
Lance Moore reaped the benefits of Colston ’s absence in 2008 as he posted career bests in every statistical category .
He had 79 receptions , 928 receiving yards and 10 receiving touchdowns — a 6.65 fantasy point per game average .
Moore has cemented his spot as the number two receiver behind Colston , which only increases his value in the Saints high powered pass attack .
Colston ’s return may mean less balls are heading his way , but none the less Moore will get his opportunities to shine in 2009 .
He is a solid receiver who is capable of posting some serious stat lines .
Scoop him up in the second to third round and use him as your number two receiver , you will be rewarded .
Devery Henderson is one of the leagues best deep threats with his blazing speed .
The problem is he is only used as a situational receiver for those deep type plays , other than that he is not a big part of the offense .
In 2008 Henderson had one of his better seasons , posting 793 receiving yards , and 3 touchdowns — a 3.81 fantasy point per game average .
Henderson ’s pecking order is third in line behind Moore , which does n’t leave him with many balls to catch .
If you can pick Henderson up in the later rounds , do it , he is a great bye - week replacement .
He has the ability to snag the occasional long touchdown , although if there are injures to the receivers ahead of him his value could sky rocket .
Tightend : Jeremy Shockey , Billy Miller
At one point Jeremy Shockey was considered one of the best , if not the best tightend in football .
His debut with the Saints , after some tumultuous seasons with the Giants , was not very successful .
In 12 games in 2008 Shockey posted career lows in every category .
He had 50 receptions , 483 receiving yards , and no receiving touchdowns — a 2.01 fantasy point per game average .
He battled a groin injury for most of the season which forced him to miss four games , now healthy he will look to rebound .
He has multiple reasons to be motivated in 2009 , check here for them all .
If some of the bigger name tightend ’s are the off the board , I would n’t hesitate to take him , after all he has tremendous upside with the ability to get white hot .
Billy Miller was a nice fill in option for Shockey last season .
In 08 he totaled 45 receptions , 579 yards , and 1 tocuhdown — a 2.33 fantasy point per game average .
Miller has the capacity to post some decent numbers with the Saints , the only problem is there are allot of receiving options ahead of him looking to get the ball .
You have to consider him a low end fantasy tight end , unless Shockey gets hurt .
If you looking for a backup tightend grab him in the lower rounds .
Defense / Special Teams
The Saints and defense are not a synonymous term , as statistically they have been ranked near the bottom of the league for the last two seasons .
All that may change this next season as the Saints defense has been completely overhauled this off season period .
First , defensive coordinator Gary Gibbs was replaced by Gregg Williams , who brings an attacking style variable 4 -3/46 defensive scheme to New Orleans .
Next they re-vamped the entire secondary , bringing in safety Darren Sharper , cornerback Jabari Greer , and drafting the best cornerback in the draft Malcolm Jenkins .
On top of this promising young cornerback Tracy Porter will be back in the lineup after missing eleven games in 2008 .
Randall Gay wil also be a returning starter , Gay had a solid season last year leading the team in pass deflections .
They have also bolstered the defensive line by bringing in Paul Spicer , Rod Coleman , and Anthony Hargrove .
This is a much improved unit from last year , one that has flown under the radar for the time being .
They may not be an elite DST like the Steelers , but expect some big things from the Saints D in 09 .
Take the chance and make sure they are one of the first units off the board .

The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission sued AT&T on Thursday , accusing the nation 's largest phone company of discriminating against workers over 40 .
NEW YORK , Aug 20 ( Reuters ) - The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission sued AT&T Inc on Thursday , accusing the nation 's largest phone company of discriminating against workers over 40 .
In a lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan , the EEOC said Dallas - based AT&T had " no legitimate business or reason " for its nationwide policy not to rehire employees who had retired under various retirement and severance programs .
The EEOC said tens of thousands of retirees covered by the programs , including a Voluntary Retirement Incentive Program and an Enhanced Pension and Retirement Program , are harmed by the policy , which it said took effect in October 2006 .
" From what AT&T has told us , there are in excess of 50,000 individuals subject to these plans , " said Louis Graziano , an EEOC lawyer handling the case , in an interview .
" At most , very few people under 40 would be affected . "
Graziano said that for many years prior to 2006 , the programs let retirees reapply for jobs after a six - month waiting period .
The current AT&T was created in 2005 when SBC Communications Inc bought what had been AT&T Corp .
Marty Richter , an AT&T spokesman , declined to comment on the lawsuit .
He said the phone company makes diversity a top priority , and that discrimination of any sort , including on the basis of age , " is not tolerated . "
AT&T employs 294,600 people , according to its website .
The EEOC is seeking the rehiring of and payment of back wages to affected employees , an injunction against further discrimination , and other remedies .
It brought the case on behalf of John Yates , who was 57 years old when AT&T turned him down for employment .
Yates could not immediately be reached for comment .
The EEOC filed a similar federal case in Missouri against a unit of the insurer Allstate Corp ( ALL.N ) in 2004 .
That case is still ongoing .
AT&T shares were up 17 cents to $ 25.55 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange .
The AT&T case is EEOC v. AT&T Inc , U.S. District Court , Southern District of New York ( Manhattan ) , No. 09-7323 .
The Allstate case is EEOC v. Allstate Insurance Co , U.S. District Court , Eastern District of Missouri ( St. Louis ) , No. 04-1359 .

Homoeroticism :

I mean all the crap about Arnold being Der Gropin ’fuhrer was just a rightwing - ruse to distract Californians from the fact that Schwarzenegger has starred in the single gayest movie ever made .

Meaning of course that while others might have been confused about Boy George ’s sexuality back in 1986 , Arnold knew the straight truth .
Or lack thereof .
When Arnold ’s old commander comes to tell Die Governator that somebody is killing all of his old men , Schwarzenegger sneaks up behind him and puts a hard gun in his back .
The commander says , “ Silent and smooth — just like always . ”
Is that what straight men say when another dude sticks ’em with something hard from behind ?
Did n’t think so .
Arnold also of course picks up another man by his balls .
And , for God knows what reason , Arnold is in a pair of skimpy speedos for at least four minutes .
Just paddling around in a boat .
Oh , wait — I know the reason .
But , you ca n’t talk about the amazing gayness of Commando without mentioning Bennett .
In fact , if I ever go back to school , my thesis will detail how the late twentieth / early twenty - first century embracing of homosexuality stems from Vernon Wells ’ portrayal of this particular character .
After I ’m done , West Hollywood will be renamed “ Vernon Wells . ”
Where to even start …
Bennett spends nearly the entire movie wearing the following outfit :
Leather pants
A black , sleeveless T - shirt
A chain mail vest
A large belt that turns said chain mail into a little skirt
Fingerless leather gloves
A dog chain choker
A flat top
A push broom moustache
A leather belt that he wore around the chain mail vest , making it seem as if he were wearing a skirt .
Yes , I stated this point earlier , but holy fuck does it need repeating !
Basically your standard leather - daddy getup , minus the cop hat .
His Australian accent does n’t help things , either .
For no apparent reason , Bennett exclaims ,  John , I ’m not going to shoot you between the eyes .
I ’m going to shoot you between the balls . 
Money shoot him between the balls …
But what really sent my gaydar off the chart was the following exchange between Arnold and Mr. Wells :
Matrix :
You can beat me …
You want to put a knife in me .
Look me in the eyes .
See what ’s going on in there while you turn it .
That ’s what you want to do to me , right ?
Come on , let the girl go .
You and me .
Do n’t deprive yourself of some pleasure .
Come on Bennett ; let ’s party .
Bennett : “ I do n’t need the girl — I do n’t need the girl ! ! “
Short of Arnold actually licking Vernon ’s ass , you simply could not come up with a gayer scene .
Seriously , men fucking is straighter .
And of course , you cant spell Commando without man ,  do or personal lubricant . 
Corpse Count :
Commando almost features more murders than it does homosexual innuendos .
Almost .
146 people are shot , blown up , stabbed , scalped , dropped off cliffs and mutilated , and fully 138 of those onscreen deaths happen during a four - minute time frame .
Four fucking minutes !
Without doubt the bloodiest four minutes in the history of film , easily trumping the even finale of the great Death Wish 3 .
In one particularly noteworthy sequence , Schwarzenegger ’s John Matrix character manages to commit five murders using a pitchfork , an axe , a machete and two circular saw blades–all within the span of twenty seconds !
He even kills two guys with one bullet .
Maybe even more impressive than the amount of men that he kills is the amount of men that he just beats the living crap out of .
Specifically one scene where he not only hits a guy with a phone booth , but then he throws eight grown men flying through the air at the same time !
The Wachowskis obviously stole this far superior scene for Neo ’s lame - ass fight with 5 dozen Agent Smiths in the Matrix sequel .
And we know where they got the name of their film .
And we know why the one brother is a cross-dressing transvestite .
How Bad Is It Really ?
Bad ?
Bad ?
Look , I ’ll be the first to admit that it is hard to retain one ’s critical faculties while watching THE RADDEST MOVIE EVER MADE !!!
But seriously , Commando rules .
If the purpose of a film is solely to entertain , then no movie has anything on Commando .
Did I mention that at one point Arnold and Alyssa Milano are feeding a deer ?
And that hes wearing a pink shirt tucked into white shorts ?
Holy shit , that rules .
What is also fantastic about Commando is that for all the ridiculously over - the - top uber - mensch moves Schwarzenegger makes , Rae Dawn Chong is constantly reminding us just how over - the - top and ridiculous all of the macho bullshit is .
Here ’s what I mean :
Cooke ( The Great Bill Duke ) : Scared , motherfucker ?
Well , you should be .
Cause this Green Beret ’s going to kick you ass .
Matrix ( Arnold ) : “ I eat Green Berets for breakfast .
And right now ( punch ) I ’m ( kick ) very ( slap ) hungry . ”
Cooke gets tossed through a wall .
Cindy ( Dawn Chong ) : “ I do n’t believe this macho bullshit ! ”
See , that ’s what makes Commando succeed on so many levels .
You do n’t believe the macho bullshit , either .
But you love it .
The director tells you exactly what to think , in case the action is too fast and you ca n’t pay attention to everything that is going on .
Like , when Arnold throws Cooke through the wall onto a couple who somehow kept having sex despite the four gunshots in the next room , Rae Dawn observes , “ These guys eat too much red meat . ”
Again , exactly right .
Also of note is when the naked couple emerges from underneath the covers , the woman is behind the man .
Yeah , buddy !
One - Liner :
Move over Henny Youngman .
Take a hike Don Rickles .
Here comes Commando !
Honestly , everything else aside ( yes , even the hot man - on - man action ) , what I love most about Commando are all the brilliant , transcendent One - Liners .
From , “ Do n’t disturb my friend .
He ’s dead - tired ” to “ I ’m air sick , ” Commando trumps all other movies ever made–EVER –when it comes to One - Liners .
I mean , even when the bad guy asks the eleven - year - old girl , “ You ’ll be together with him soon .
Wo n’t that be nice ? ”
The eleven - fucking - year - old girl says , “ Not as nice as watching him smash your face in . ”
Even the soon - to - be - fodder for Arnolds mighty gun D grade bad guys get to rip some off ,  Slitting a little girls throat is like cutting warm butter . 
However , Commando being Commando , Bennett retorts ,  Put that knife away and shut your mouth . 
Remember , in 80s Actions , knives are dicks .
Post - Mortem One - Liner :
Let ’s be honest here .
With the possible exception of Predator no other movie in history has half as many good sentences to hilariously celebrate the death of a fellow human being .
The greatest Post - Mortem One - Liner of all time is the following : Schwarzenegger has just chased down and run Sully ’s ( David Patrick Kelly ) Porsche off the road with an Austin Healy Sprite .
After ramming the Sprite head - on at 80 miles - per - hour into a telephone pole , Arnold checks to see if Rae Dawn is alive and then pulls Sully out of the Porsche , demanding to know where his ( Matrix ’s ) daughter is .
Sully tells him to fuck off .
Arnold says , “ Listen , loyalty is very touching but it ’s not the most important thing in your life right now .
Gravity is . ”
Great line , but , well , keep reading .
Arnold then carries
Sully over to a cliff and dangles him over the edge by one leg ( look for the wire holding Sully up ) .
After some more words are exchanged , Schwarzenegger says to Sully , “ Hey Sully , remember when I said I ’d kill you last ? ”
Sully then says , “ Yeah , you promised you ’d kill me last . ”
To which our governor responds , “ I lied . ”
He then drops Sully off the side of Mulholland Drive .
Now , I know what you are thinking .
That is technically a “ Pre-Mortem ” One - Liner .
Right , except for the fact that just before Schwarzenegger pushes Sully ’s Porsche back onto its wheels , Rae Dawn asks , “ What happened to Sully ? ”
“ I had to let him go . ”
Holy shit , is that funny / brilliant !
It has had me laughing for the past twenty years .
Stupid Political Content :
None really .
I mean all the usual romanticized military / vigilante crap is front and center , but it is obviously such homosexual fantasy that any overtures to the right are lost on everyone , save castratos .
Sure , he lives isolated and alone with a literal arsenal in his tool shed , but look at that chest !
We could begin to discuss how a man could murder over a dozen - dozen people and yet be smiling at the end of it all ( sheer fascism ) , but then , those biceps start calling my name .
All bulgy and shit .
There is one odd part where Arnold explains to Alyssa Milano , “ When I was a boy and Rock and Roll came to East Germany [ the ] communists said it was subversive …
Maybe they were right ? ”
But honestly , I had way too large of a hard - on to make heads or tails of it .
OK , fine — tails .
Novelty Death :
At the climax of the “ fight ” between Bennett and Matrix , Arnold somehow manages to rip a 4 - inch diameter pipe off the wall and hurl it through Bennett ’s chest .
Of course , before Arnold even sees the pipe , Bennett has a sub- machine gun leveled at him .
And of course after the pipe goes through Bennett ’s chest , Arnold says , “ Let off some steam , Bennett . ”
God , I love this movie !!!
Was There An Atomic Blast At The End ?
No , but Arnold ’s old commander does say that he is expecting World War 3 .
He seems to be looking forward to Armageddon , too .
What You Learned :
If I was al Queda , I would not fuck with California while Schwarzenegger is in charge .
Also , if you watch the scene when Arnold is blowing up all the military barracks , you can actually see the support beams that are holding up the dummies .
Oh , and I am definitely , severely , chronically gay .

WASHINGTON -- Lawmakers have demanded greater openness from companies receiving government bailouts but have yet to release online or electronic versions of their own office expenditures -- including taxpayer - funded tabs for leased cars and staff retreats at hotels .
House and Senate lawmakers are given an annual allowance of $ 1.3 million to $ 4.5 million to run their offices .
Most is spent on staff salaries , but money is also used for official equipment , office supplies and travel .
The House and Senate say they are considering making lawmakers ' spending records available in electronic form .
Currently , the information is published only in printed volumes .
House records reviewed by The Wall Street Journal include a few words of description on each expenditure , along with the date and amount .
The Senate provides less detail , with expenses falling into generic categories such as " purchased equipment " and payments often listed as going to banks or other intermediaries .
Senate records for the office of Majority Leader Harry Reid include a $ 23,650 item marked " Per Diem Expenses For Staff Retreat Held in Annapolis MD . "
State taxes going up because of deflation STATE TAXES State rates will be going up with adjustment for the sour economy
Image 1 of / 1 Caption Close State taxes going up because of deflation 1 / 1 Back to Gallery
California taxpayers just got hit with another increase in state income taxes , and it did n't require a vote from a single legislator .
The culprit : deflation .
In 1982 , California voters approved a proposition that indexed state income tax rates to inflation .
So each year , the California Franchise Tax Board adjusts tax brackets and certain deductions and credits for inflation .
The annual adjustment is tied to the California Consumer Price Index , and it usually goes up .
Indexing is designed to prevent people from paying higher taxes as their incomes rise proportionately with inflation .
But when inflation turns negative , indexing works in reverse .
Tax brackets and credits are adjusted downward .
If your income remains the same , the result is a tax increase .
The Franchise Tax Board has just released adjustments for 2009 , and for the first time since 1983 they are down , reflecting a 1.5 percent drop in the California Consumer Price Index between June 2008 and June 2009 .
As a result , everyone 's state taxes will go up by a modest amount this year .
The amount will vary depending on taxpayers ' income , whether they itemize deductions and how many personal exemptions and other credits they claim .
A single person with no dependents and $ 51,000 in adjusted gross income would pay an extra $ 41 .
A married couple with two dependents and $ 90,000 in income would pay $ 71 more , according to the Franchise Tax Board .
( This assumes both parties take the standard deduction . )
Once a taxpayer reaches the top tax bracket , the added tax does n't change much no matter how much money they make .
A married couple with two dependents and $ 1 million in income would pay only $ 79 more as a result of deflation .
This tax hike comes on top of two increases the state Legislature approved for 2009 - a 0.25 percentage point increase in tax rates and a sharp decline in the tax credit for dependents .
Those increases will cost taxpayers much more than the deflation factor , says Gina Rodriquez , Sacramento editor with Spidell Publishing , which works with tax professionals .
This is only one of many taxes and benefits that are being upended by deflation .
In California , property tax assessments are adjusted each year based on the change in the state Consumer Price Index for the 12 months ending the previous October .
Through June , the index is down 0.7 percent .
Proposition 13 limited the annual increase to 2 percent but did n't say exactly what would happen if there was deflation .
The California Board of Equalization expects to announce next week whether property taxes will go down next year if the CPI is negative .
Some seniors are complaining because they probably wo n't get an increase in Social Security benefits next year because of deflation .
Benefits are indexed each year to inflation , but by law can never go down .
Federal taxes also are indexed to inflation .
Adjustments for 2009 were announced in October and were based on the change in U.S. CPI for the 12 months that ended Aug. 31 , 2008 .
Inflation during that period was positive , so adjustments were up .
It 's not clear what will happen in 2010 if inflation for the 12 months ending in August is negative .
" It 's likely it would be down about 1.7 percent , " says Mark Luscombe , principal tax analyst with publishing company CCH .
Technically , the IRS could adjust brackets down , " but there is speculation the IRS might have enough wiggle room to leave it the same , " thus preventing a tax increase .
" The IRS is aware of the issue , but we are not speculating at this time , " says IRS spokesman Jesse Weller .
In California , inflation - indexing started in the late 1970s .
" The Legislature in 1979 had fully indexed the income tax for 1980 and 1981 .
An attempt to continue full indexing was vetoed by Gov. ( Jerry ) Brown on fiscal grounds , " David Doerr writes in " California 's Tax Machine . "
In 1982 , California voters approved Proposition 7 , which made inflation indexing permanent .
The next year , inflation turned negative , but that did n't happen again until this year .
The Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association , which fought for Proposition 7 , does not object to the tax increase resulting from deflation .
" Hey , fair is fair , " says association President Jon Coupal .
" If there is true deflationary pressure , then we 're OK with those rates being adjusted accordingly . "
The tax increase will bring in much - needed revenue for the state , but not as much as it had factored into this year 's budget .
" We thought ( deflation ) would be 2.2 percent , " says H.D. Palmer , a spokesman for the state Department of Finance .
Because deflation was only 1.5 percent , " There is actually going to be a marginal hit to the state 's bottom line . "
The state has not broken out how much tax revenue it expects from the deflation factor .
Justin Garosi , an economist with the Legislative Analyst 's Office , estimates that if deflation had been 1.5 percent in 2006 , ( the last year for which tax data is available ) it would have raised about $ 295 million ( factoring in an adjustment for the change in the dependent credit ) .
By comparison , a quarter - point increase in rates in 2006 would have brought in about $ 2 billion .
The new tax rate schedules were released to professionals last week and will be posted this week at www.ftb.ca.gov.
The judge who presided over the recent Pirate Bay trial has denied he had a " conflict of interest " , after a Swedish radio station revealed he is a member of the country 's main copyright association .
Sveriges Radio , described as Sweden 's answer to the BBC , said that judge Norström is not only a member of the Swedish Copyright Association but also sits on the board of the Swedish Association for the Protection of Industrial Property , an organisation that lobbies for tougher copyright laws .
The four co-founders of Pirate Bay were found guilty last week of charges relating to copyright infringement .
Judge Norström today denied his involvement with the two pro-copyright organisations constituted a " conflict of interest " in his ability to preside over the most high - profile trial involving illegal filesharing in European history .
The defendants , Fredrik Neij , Gottfrid Svartholm , Peter Sunde and and Carl Lundström , were found guilty on 33 specific charges of making files accessible for illegal sharing .
They have been ordered to pay a fine of € 2.7 m ( £ 2.4 ) and have been sentenced to one year in prison .
The verdict was decided by both the judge and jury .
The trial became the focus of media attention when the co-founders , who Twittered their version of events throughout the trial , were given jail terms for their role in Pirate Bay .
The verdict is being treated as a major victory by the entertainment industry , while those opposed to the verdict point out that Pirate Bay technically acts as torrent site and does not actually host files itself .
On hearing the news today , defence lawyers said they would be calling for a retrial .
" I will point that out in my appeal , then the court of appeal will decide if the district court decision should be set aside and the case revisited , " Peter Althin , Peter Sunde 's lawyer , said today .
Not All Audits Are Created Equal
It was last Friday that I was walking back from the mailbox and flipping through the mail that I saw one of the most dreaded envelopes you could imagine .
It had the IRS logo and information in the return address spot .
I knew that any letter from the IRS at this time of year has probably anything but good news in it .
As I open it , I ’m expecting the worst .
This was the first year I ’ve ever hired an accountant and claimed the home office deduction .
I thought for sure that I ’ve triggered some sort of red flag and I ’m going to get the financial equivalent of a rectal exam .
But my fears were calmed as i started to read the letter .
Yes , there was an error with my return , and yes , I did owe the IRS more money , but it was really not a big deal .
It was still enough to tie your stomach in knots as you open a letter like that .
Luckily , my problem was minor and it could be resolved easily .
The Problem
It was actually a simple mistake on my part , but they obviously were quick to catch it .
When I set up my estimated quarterly tax payments last year , I had the intention of setting it up so that I paid the same amount each quarter and a nice round number .
I use EFTPS for electronic payment , but I also just record the amount and date of each payment in a payment log that I then hand over to the accountant .
So , when it came time to do my taxes , all they need is how much I paid in total in estimated taxes for the year , so I gave them the number I had .
Well , what I did n’t realize was that for some reason I paid $ 500 less for that estimated quarterly payment .
I still do n’t the reason behind that or why I recorded the amount paid incorrectly , but clearly this showed up on my tax return when they compared the amount I paid via EFTPS to what I said I paid .
The IRS was kind enough to send me a copy of the EFTPS transactions and it sure enough indicated that I paid $ 500 less on that first payment .
So , they simply ask that I pay the $ 500 plus interest and penalty .
Well , thankfully that only worked out to a couple dollars .
They even provided a self - addressed envelope , so rectifying the situation is as simple as writing a check .
Crisis averted , although an important lesson was learned — always double check your records and do n’t make any assumptions .
The Correspondence Audit
This is the type of audit I experienced , and it ’s the most common type .
In fact , many people receive these each year without even realizing it ’s what most audits consist of .
The correspondence audit is simply a letter sent to you by the IRS that identifies a possible error , information regarding the error , and instructions on how to remedy the problem .
In some cases this may result in actually receiving a larger refund , but more often than it means you ’ll owe some additional money unless you can prove otherwise .
This correspondence also includes information for how to challenge the IRS ’s claim and what information you might need if you want to fight it .
Either way , these audits are relatively painless unless you ’ve done something major such as failing to report something significant .
As long as you take care of the problem in a timely fashion , you ’re not likely to encounter any further correspondence from the IRS .
The In - Office Audit
This is one of the audit types that people usually think about and fear .
In these situations , you actually have to gather information and take it to an IRS office to prove that your return is accurate .
The auditor will schedule a date and time to meet and suggest what documentation you should bring so that you can substantiate your claim .
It ’s obvious to see how this can be something to fear .
If you have n’t kept good records or have lost receipts or other important documentation , you obviously know that it can be difficult to prove your claim .
Depending on what the IRS asks for , it could be as simple as showing a few expenses to trying to verify that something like your home office actually qualifies for the home office deduction .
Of course , if you have good records and are n’t trying to pull a fast one , even these audits are relatively painless .
The IRS may see something differently than you do , but this is your chance to prove it and hopefully fix the issue before additional penalties are enforced .
This is where having a tax attorney or accountant can be beneficial .
The Field Audit
The final type of audit is n’t typically going to happen to an individual .
The field audit is one where the IRS sends an agent into the field to meet with a taxpayer on - site .
These audits are most commonly done on businesses or self - employed individuals making a lot of money .
These audits are also sometimes the most feared .
If you do happen to be subject to a field audit , it ’s imperative to have legal counsel .
There may be significant sums of money at stake and tax laws can be complicated , so having someone on your side that specializes in tax law can potentially save you or even your business .
The Importance Keeping Good Records
As you can see , fearing the IRS and an audit probably is n’t as big of a deal as you may think .
Everyone has stories about a friend who had their home ransacked by the IRS trying to turn up receipts from 5 years ago , but in most cases this just is n’t true .
For the average taxpayer an audit is simply going to be triggered by inconsistencies in their computer and can be fixed by mailing in proof of something or an extra payment .
Unless you ’re claiming a lot of extraordinary deductions or own a business , chances are an IRS audit will be little more than correspondence .
Even if it ’s as simple as that , without keeping detailed records you could find yourself in a situation where you are actually correct , but ca n’t prove it .
If you ca n’t prove it , the IRS wins .

My name is Tom Attah .
I am Black British .
You do n’t see that on forms very often .
I was named after the Irishman – Thomas Larbey – who gave my mother and father a place to live in the late 60s whilst they studied medicine .
Compassion and chance and tolerance from the United Kingdom are built into my name .
DAMNED RIGHT
I am an Englishman .
I ’m never going to pass for white but I will always , ALWAYS pass for human .
I have earned the right to call myself that down days of compassion and understanding and belonging and song .
And if I will call myself human , English , European – then I have to – HAVE to – admit where my mistakes are , and to forgive people for making theirs .
That would be to forgive the 120,000 people in Yorkshire who voted BNP this week .
There ’s a story about people who came on boats across the waters through the mist and fog because they heard tales of a land of opportunity , a place where they could make their names .
They came on long journeys where many of them died , into a harsh climate that was NOTHING like their own , to a place where they were resisted and where they did not know the language – and where they had to fight to make their voices heard .
But fight they did , and slowly but surely they integrated into the peoples and lands that they had come to so slowly and from so far away .
But enough about the central Europeans invading Roman Britain in the year 450 .
Enough about how England is named after a tribe of Germanic conquerors ( the Anglii ) , from 1,550 years ago .
This is about the BNP , so we need to skip forward almost 16 centuries to today .
I am Black English .
I can tell you the names of every UK prime minister for the last 200 years .
I do n’t think that Nick Griffin can do the same thing .
What terrifies me most is that I understand .
I know what the Barnsley BNP voters mean when they say they “ … do n’t know what they want , ” I know where they are coming from when they say they do n’t care who it is – just as long as someone claims to know who they are and what their pain is and how to cure it .
It ’s blues .
Not racist blues , HUMAN blues .
Politics IS that simple and that serious .
But my understanding was bought at a high price .
Millions of my ancestors were displaced and murdered to buy my understanding .
My forebears were beaten to death to give me my chances and my parents were abused in the streets to purchase my opportunities – so that now , when it is time for ME to understand and to forgive , when it is time for ME to share and to educate – I know how to do it .
If I do n’t stop the wheel of segregation and distrust and lies and ignorance from spinning then I have learned – WE have learned – nothing .
But I ’m angry about this .
HOW DARE YOU Nick Griffin , lie to my people .
HOW DARE YOU Nick Griffin , tell them that you are in this for them .
HOW DARE YOU Nick Griffin , tell me that I have no right to be here .
The only true indigenous peoples in the UK are the Welsh , and they are angry enough already .
This nation was BUILT on immigration , invasion , inclusion and adaption .
My father fought so many battles to get into 2009 and now here we are thinking about the same old thing – a group of people feeling like they have been forgotten , who believe that they are jobless and who think that they have no rights .
The people who voted BNP think that they have been told the truth .
Hell , on the streets of Barnsley the people did n’t even know the name of the BNP candidate they had voted for .
My job is to tell people the truth .
I play music , so that should be easy – anything that ’s a lie sounds like dissonance , out of tune , discordant to me .
I know that the blues is a state of mind , not a style of music .
The hard part is going to be telling people the truth , even though they do n’t want to hear it .
The truth is that everyone belongs .
Some need it read to them , some need it played to them – but we all BELONG .
Musicians – please play it .
Writers , please write it .
Singers , please sing it .
Artists , please paint and draw it – and everyone else – EVERYONE else – just show it and believe it and demonstrate it and let it shine out of you because you KNOW that it ’s the truth .
Tell everyone what you have told me , because we are friends , and we are friends for a REASON .
Me – I have some incredible and beautiful and talented people in my life .
I am lucky like that .
I play gigs so all I can do and WILL do for the next year or so is transmit the message above to the disenfranchised people or to those who did n’t vote this time round and tell them how important it is that they VOTE NEXT TIME – because if they do n’t , shit like this happens .
The Barnsley people DIDN ’T EVEN KNOW THE NAME OF THE PERSON THEY ELECTED .
( http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/8090322.stm)
All they knew is that something – anything - had to better than what they have got now .
How do we explain to people about their potential ?
How do we show people that they are more empowered than they have ever , ever been ?
I am open to suggestions .
What do you think I can do – what do you think that WE can do to change all of this ?
It ’ll be a slow process , but look at how far we have come , look at what we have at our disposal – if you are reading this , look at how easily we can talk to each other .
How do we take a message of understanding and inclusion – the message that I have learned and been taught for the last 36 years – to people who have forgotten it or never been taught that they belong in the world , not on an island ?
But you know – it could be easier than I think .
After all , everyone likes a curry and a bit of motown .
The Daily Telegraph has egg , and perhaps a few other ingredients , on its face after naming the wrong winner of MasterChef Australia last night .
So what happened ?
The Daily Telegraph has egg , and perhaps a few other ingredients , on its face after naming the wrong winner of MasterChef Australia last night .
In the process it has embarrassed its TV reporter , exposed the widespread newspaper habit of pre-writing the news and highlighted some of Ten ’s dodgy publicity practices .
Last night at 8.57 pm
The Daily Telegraph ’s online site posted a story with the headline “ Poh Wins MasterChef Australia ” and described the South Australian contestant ’s joy at winning the popular show .
Not since The Herald Sun called the 1993 federal election for John Hewson has a newspaper been so demonstrably wrong .
The Daily Telegraph ’s TV writer , Erin McWhirter , was phoned last night at about 9.10 pm by Jo’an Papadopoulos from Ten Publicity and told that The Daily Telegraph website had posted the wrong story .
By that stage it was clear to viewers that contestant Julie Goodwin was winning .
McWhirter told Crikey today that she was “ shocked and disappointed ” when Ten called because she ’d worked hard to ensure that whatever the outcome , the paper would have an accurate story .
She did this by writing two versions of the story , with either Poh Ling Yeow or Julie Goodwin as the winner .
She had constructed the stories after interviewing both contestants on Friday and asking them a series of hypothetical questions about what it would be like to be the winner or loser respectively .

Somehow , someone posted the story too early — and the wrong version — creating the embarrassment .
She attributes this to a “ production glitch ” , and told Crikey that she does n’t know what happened but this morning an inquiry was underway to work out what went wrong .
But that ai n’t the half of it !
It transpires that when McWhirter and the other reporters from rival newspapers lined up to interview the finalists on Friday , they were all playing a game .
The series final had actually been prerecorded on July 2 and yet the contestants had to participate in interviews in which they were asked to give hypothetical answers to questions about what it was like to win something only one of them had won .
“ This is really a surreal feeling , ” Poh told The Daily Telegraph on Friday .
Well yes it would be , because there she was , giving her reaction for a story which would proclaim her as the winner when she knew — but was n’t allowed to tell the reporter — that she was n’t .
The Ten network put the reporters and the contestants in this invidious position by refusing to send out embargoed information about the winners .
Papadopoulos told Crikey that Ten had decided to keep the winner “ under wraps ” even though “ the pressure was enormous ” .
She said the plan “ worked nicely ” because there had not been a serious leak in the 17 days before it went to air .
This , no doubt , helped the staggering ratings which Papadopoulos says peaked at 4.11 million viewers , with 3.71 million tuned in for the announcement of the winner — making it the highest rating non-sport show since the beginning of the OzTam ratings system .
But what about the ethics of it all ?
Papadopoulos says it was fine because the contestants were only encouraged to talk about their feelings about the show in general and not to lie to the reporters .
She said the contestants had “ workshopped ” it so that they were ready to give general answers and not to say categorically that they had won or lost .
How then does Ten explain Julie ’s answer when she told The Daily Telegraph on Friday that “ Poh is a very deserving winner ” ?
It seems that Ten has been too tricky , wanting to create intrigue to generate publicity and putting the media in awkward situations in the process .
But equally the media covering it should not have been so compliant and should have exposed this nonsense sooner .
Not surprisingly , Papadopoulos says she hopes the final of MasterChef will be broadcast live next year .
For those of you who have been hanging around in # gentoo - haskell ( especially when I ’m around … : p ) or who have upgraded to dev-lang / ghc - 6.10.4 , you would probably have noticed the new haskell - updater package .
This is our replacement to the venerable ghc - updater script that was packaged with previous versions of GHC .
ghc -updater is a bash script that was based long ago on python - updater .
However , whilst python - updater was updated to let users use alternative package managers like Paludis or PkgCore , it was n’t as simple to upgrade ghc - updater as we bundle it with dev-lang / ghc .
So , we ( meaning I :p ) decided to split off a new haskell - updater package ( with a deliberate name change to avoid problems with name clashes ) .
At first this was just going to be based off the newer versions of python - updater , but this approach was soon abandoned ( I had trouble finding my way through what it was doing ) .
Thus , haskell - updater is unique as far as I know amongst the various app - admin / *- updater packages ( well , the only two that are there are python - updater and emacs - updater :p ) in that it is written in the languages whose packages it aims to update and rebuild .
Using Haskell for haskell - updater gives us several advantages over the “ traditional ” bash - based kludge :
It uses our language of choice ; this means we ’re more likely to be interested in it and maintain it ( and be able to maintain it ! ) in future .
A more modular design makes it easier to split apart parts of the code rather than a one - file - fits - all bash script .
Ability to use the Cabal library ( more on why this is a good thing later ) .
Speeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeed !
After all , all Gentoo - ers are ricers , are n’t we ? :p
Seriously , haskell - updater takes roughly 2s for me to run ( whilst doing more ! see below ) , ghc - updater takes 27s and I killed python - updater after 8.5 minutes :s
Have a piece of software written in Haskell that Don Stewart is n’t going to brag about having it available in Arch 😉
Now , haskell - updater does n’t just find packages installed with previous versions of GHC like ghc - updater did ; it also finds broken packages , making it equivalent to revdep - rebuild / reconcilio/etc. for Haskell packages ( though just for libraries , since at the moment GHC creates statically - linked binaries ) .
This has become a bigger problem in the last few years as the number of Haskell libraries has almost exploded ( especially after the base library being split up ) .
Until now , however , users have had to manually run “ ghc- pkg check ” and build the corresponding packages by hand ( otherwise you face the dreaded Diamond Dependency Problem ) .
However , version 1.6 of the Cabal library includes support for parsing the output of “ ghc- pkg check ” , so we ’re able to use this to have haskell - updater find these broken packages for you as well !
haskell - updater has several other incremental advantages over ghc - updater ( supports slotted packages properly ; able to find packages installed with previous versions of GHC even if someone manually went and deleted the old GHC directory when they should n’t have , etc. ) .
As such , we highly recommend that people install it and try it out .
Note , however , that it requires one of the 6.10 series of GHC releases or higher to work ( technically it does n’t as long as you install the necessary libraries yourself ; however , we ’ve stated this in the ebuild to try and avoid dependency problems when upgrading GHC ) .
With version 6.10.4 , it has completely replaced ghc - updater ( ghc- updater is still shipped with previous versions ) as the used updating tool .
Extra features we ’re considering adding in future releases :
Allow user - defined package managers ( in case of custom scripts , etc. ) .
The ability to print out the command to rebuild the packages rather than actually running it .
Detect and fix packages that did n’t get re-registered by ghc- pkg when re-building the same version of GHC ( this seems to be a problem when using Paludis ) .
Adding colours to the output 😉
Note that haskell - updater is not available on HackageDB like most other Haskell software ; this is to avoid name - pollution there , and because we do n’t think non-Gentoo users are going to be interested in it ( and Gentoo users will probably have it automatically installed for them anyway ) .
Dear Margo :
Our daughter started college a year ago , and we ’ve noticed during her visits home that she ’s not the sweet , innocent girl we sent away for higher learning .
We raised her with strong Christian beliefs , but lately she ’s saying that she ’s joined an atheist club on campus and is questioning everything we taught her .
Now my husband refuses to let her in the house and is threatening to turn her in to the FBI .
I ’ve tried to cure our daughter and reconcile with her , but nothing seems to work .
I ’ve prayed over her at night while she sleeps , enlisted friends in a phone prayer tree and even spoken to my priest about the possibility of an exorcism .
I ’m at my wits ’ end .
How can I recover my daughter and keep her from hell ?
— God-fearing
Dear God : Whoa , dear .
While I am sympathetic to anyone ’s devotion to their religion , you need to realize that your daughter is a sentient being with the right to reject your religious views if she so chooses .
Your husband is pathetically misguided if he thinks he can call the FBI to report the “ crime ” of your daughter joining an atheists club .
Ditto for the exorcism .
This young woman is not possessed , demonic or doing weird things ; she is merely thinking and questioning the religion she grew up with .
I would encourage you to understand that all people , your daughter included , have the right to think for themselves , particularly about something as meaningful as religion .
As for hell , well , she appears willing to take her chances .
— Margo , contemplatively
When the In - Laws Think They ’re All Cordon Bleu Graduates
Dear Margo : I am devastated .
My in - laws , without saying so , think I ’m a lousy cook .
Each time I invite them to dinner , my husband ’s aunt and mother decide they have to come over and “ help ” me .
At first I found this a lovely gesture , until I realized their “ help ” meant them taking over .
I put two and two together and came to the conclusion that I must be a lousy cook .
I asked my family to be honest , and they insisted that my cooking was very good .
I decided to make dinner ahead of time .
My in - laws barely touched their food .
Some said they were n’t too hungry , others had “ eaten before , ” all said it was “ just wonderful . ” I decided to conduct an experiment .
My sister - in - law reluctantly agreed to help me .
I cooked a meal at my house , went to her house with the food an hour before the guests were to arrive , and it looked like she had cooked the dinner .
The guests had seconds and thirds and raved about how delicious everything was .
Now what should I do ? — “ Burnt ” in Philly
Dear Burn : I think this is hysterical , and you should , too .
For whatever reason , the in - laws want to think you ca n’t cook .
Maybe they are nuts .
As close as I can come to helping you understand what is going on is to remember an episode from my junior year in high school .
I had been taking Latin for three years , and our class had to write one composition per semester ( in Latin ) .
All my submissions earned a C . I became curious about whether our teacher had simply decided I was a C student ( no blonde jokes , please ) , so I asked Roy Sonderling , the reigning genius in the class , if he would write two papers and let one of them be mine .
He said fine … and , in fact , he said he ’d give me the better one .
Well , I handed it in and it came back with a C .
( His , of course , got an A . )
So I would take it in stride , my dear .
For whatever reason , they ’ve put you in the “ ca n’t cook ” slot .
I recommend that , in the future , whenever the in - laws come to your house , let them “ help ” and just think of them as caterers .
Then relax and take it easy .

Facebook or MySpace communication is not " rounded " , the Archbishop said Social networking websites , texting and e-mails are undermining community life , the leader of the Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales has warned .
Archbishop Vincent Nichols said MySpace and Facebook led young people to seek " transient " friendships , with quantity becoming more important than quality .
He said a key factor in suicide among young people was the trauma caused when such loose relationships collapsed .
" Friendship is not a commodity , " he told the Sunday Telegraph newspaper .
He added : " Friendship is something that is hard work and enduring when it 's right " .
' Transient relationships ' Archbishop Nichols said society was losing some of its ability to build communities through inter-personal communication , as the result of excessive use of texts and e-mails rather than face - to - face meetings or telephone conversations .
He said skills such as reading a person 's mood and body language were in decline , and that exclusive use of electronic information had a " dehumanising " effect on community life .
Facebook and MySpace might contribute towards communities , but I 'm wary about it
Archbishop Vincent Nichols
Send us your comments Archbishop Nichols said that social networking sites such as Facebook and MySpace encouraged a form of communication that was not in his words " rounded " , and would not therefore build rounded communities .
The Archbishop also warned of the danger of suicide among young people who threw themselves into a network of friendships that could easily collapse .
He said young people were being encouraged to build up collections of friends as commodities , and were left desolate when these transient relationships broke down .
" Facebook and MySpace might contribute towards communities , but I 'm wary about it , " he told the newspaper .
" Among young people often a key factor in their committing suicide is the trauma of transient relationships .
" They throw themselves into a friendship or network of friendships , then it collapses and they 're desolate .
" It 's an all - or - nothing syndrome that you have to have in an attempt to shore up an identity ; a collection of friends about whom you can talk and even boast . "

Today , while discussing Asian beers , I was asked the following question : do you prefer Kirin to Sapporo .
Allow me to suggest an experiment .
Next time you eat sushi , instead of reaching for a frosty Kirin or Sapporo , drink Budweiser .
That 's right .
Event after I lambasted President Obama for drinking the stuff , I 'd like you to try some with your next serving of gyoza .
Do n't worry , it 's for an observation .
I 'm willing to bet a boat - load of sushi that what you washed down your toro with tastes virtually the same to your preferred Japanese brew ; fizzy , yellow and better served as cold as possible if it must be served at all .
What I 'm getting at is that we seem to put these thinly - veiled equivalents to our own mass - produced beer on pedestals just because they 're brands from other countries .
It does n't matter if I prefer Kirin to Sapporo ; they 're practically identical .
What I 'm searching for is a beer of Asian descent then leaves the fizzy , yellow universe behind and strives to have a full - bodied flavor .
Today 's review does not fit the bill , so please , I beg of you , help me find an Asian beer that does n't suck .
Tastes : Tiger Beer from Asia Pacific Breweries was launched in 1932 as Singapore 's first locally brewed beer .
And in the subsequent years it has remained a lifeless , easy - to - drink lager lacking anything vibrant or interesting ... like taste .
I got mine : on special at Lost Leaf .
If I had this chilling in my beer inventory I 'd try to get rid of it quick too .
Goes with : absolute thirst .
If you 're so thirsty that you just have to have a cold drink , regardless of any reservations you may have about drinking it because you know good beer and this is n't it , I can see how Tiger might be an option .
Verdict : Singapore should have just named Tiger " Beer " and gotten it over with .
Anything other than a generic name is false advertising .
Should we breath a sigh of relief that Goldman Sachs ( GS ) has posted record earnings as revenue from trading and stock underwriting reached all - time highs ( second quarter net income was $ 3.44 billion ) — less than a year after the firm took $ 10 billion directly from taxpayers and $ 13 billion indirectly through AIG ?
In some ways , yes .
That Goldman is back signals that the worst of Wall Street ’s recent meltdown is over .
And at least New York City ’s economy will again benefit from the trickle - down effects of the multi-million dollar bonuses of Goldman ’s executives and traders .
But in another respect , Goldman ’s resurgence should send shivers down the backs of every hardworking American who has lost a large chunk of retirement savings in this economic debacle , as well as the millions who have lost their jobs .
Why ?
Because Goldman ’s high - risk business model has n’t changed one bit from what it was before the implosion of Wall Street .
Goldman is still wagering its capital and fueling giant bets with lots of borrowed money .
While its rivals have pared back risks , Goldman has increased them .
And its renewed success at this old game will only encourage other big banks to go back into it .
“ Our model really never changed , we ’ve said very consistently that our business model remained the same , ” Goldman ’s chief financial officer tells Bloomberg News .
Value - at - risk — a statistical measure of how much the firm ’s trading operations could lose in a day — rose to an average of $ 245 million in the second quarter from $ 240 million in the first quarter .
In the second quarter of 2008 , VaR averaged $ 184 million .
Meanwhile , Goldman is still depending on $ 28 billion in outstanding debt issued cheaply with the backing of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation .
Which means you and I are still indirectly funding Goldman ’s high - risk operations .
Goldman is skillful at playing the market .
Now that most of its major competitors are out of the action or still under the strict control of the Treasury and the Fed , it has the market mostly to itself .
Expect the others to jump back in to high - risk deals as soon as they can .
But Goldman is also skillful at playing politics — something its rivals are n’t nearly as good at .
Recall that last fall , at a closed meeting between Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson ( formerly Goldman ’s CEO ) , Tim Geithner ( then at the New York Fed ) , and a handful of others to decide on the fate of giant insurer AIG , Goldman ’s cheif executive , Lloyd Blankfein , was at the table .
The decision to bail out AIG resulted in a $ 13 billion giveaway to Goldman because Goldman was an AIG counterparty .
Indeed , Goldman executives and alumni have played crucial roles in guiding the Wall Street bailout from the start .
So the fact that Goldman has reverted to its old ways in the market suggests it has every reason to believe it can revert to its old ways in politics , should its market strategies backfire once again — leaving the rest of us once again to pick up the pieces .

The armed raid in which an estimated £ 40 m worth of jewellery was stolen from a London store was captured on video by a passing member of the public .
The film shows the robbers outside Graff jewellers in New Bond Street , shooting as they make their getaway with a female member of staff .
The two robbers armed with handguns got away with 43 jewels and watches .
Detectives believe at least two other people helped the raiders as they sped from the shop .
They made their getaway in a blue BMW which was abandoned in nearby Dover Street .
Police described the two robbers as " extremely dangerous "
Another shot was then fired before they got into a silver Mercedes and drove into Farm Street where it is believed some of the suspects got into another vehicle , possibly a black Ford Galaxy or Volkswagen Sharan .
Among the items stolen were a pair of white round diamond double - hoop earrings , a yellow diamond flower necklace , a platinum white Marquise diamond ring and a Chronograff men 's watch .
The haul is thought to be the biggest ever netted in the UK , almost doubling the £ 23 m worth of items stolen in a raid on the same shop in 2003 .
Det Ch Insp Pam Mace from the Flying Squad described the raid as " well planned " and said the robbers are " extremely dangerous " .
The first suspect is described as white , about 30 years old , slim and between 5ft 10ins and 6ft tall .
The other man is described as black , in his 30s , 6ft tall , more well - built and with very short hair .
CCTV pictures of them entering the shop were released by officers .
Det Ch Insp
Mace said : " Someone knows who these men are , they would undoubtedly have spoken about it beforehand or boasted about it afterwards .
" I would urge anyone who recognises them , knows the whereabouts of the jewellery or has any other information to contact us . "

Outside of Canal Walk in Indianapolis , IN there is a large structure with different colored " flags " that move around in the wind .
Even thought there was a little wind at the time , I still managed to get some identical photos for this HDR shot ( I know I mostly use that , but hey , at least I take normal shots in the process , right ? )

Author Rory Stewart is a star at Harvard ’s Kennedy School , mentioned as a future Foreign Secretary in the UK .
Here he is in the Kashmir Observer , putting the lie to the George Packer - Charles Ferguson claim that the Iraq invasion , which Stewart supported , would have succeeded if we just had n’t disbanded the army .
My instinct is that the mission was doomed from the start .
Of course we made a number of errors – de-Baathification , abolition of the army , looting , etc. , etc. – but these were ultimately minor .
Even had we avoided those errors , the invasion would still have failed .
The reasons lay deep in the limitations of contemporary Western government institutions , which in turn reflect the limitations of our own politics and society on the one side and on the other the fractures within Iraqi society .
Then he goes after the neocons :
Some of the critics of these kinds of interventions say the problem is we ’re not being Machiavellian enough or aggressive enough .
But the reality is that our societies do n’t produce Machiavellian princes , but even if they did produce Machiavellian princes the public and those officials would not be comfortable with such treatment .
And even if they were it is unlikely it would be successful for the final reason , which is of course the destruction of Iraqi society itself , which has been significantly hollowed out : the political administration has for the last twenty or thirty years lacked any autonomy , financial responsibility , or independence ; people are very reluctant to take political office or exercise political power ; most of the traditional forces such as the Sheikh were largely obliterated over fifty years of land reform and change ; and Iraqi society essentially is struggling to reconcile itself to the reality of a foreign occupation .
Nationalism is extremely strong , insurgency and sectarianism is extremely strong .
In different ways all of these things meant that the Iraqi society is extremely unlikely either to consent to the occupation or to provide people who are prepared to take on the sort of administration involved in this sort of occupation .
KO : So in light of the troubles in Iraq and the deteriorating situation in Afghanistan , are the tools of Western foreign policy and reconstruction incapable of building and securing democracies in foreign countries ?
RS : I think the creation of democratic institutions is something that needs to be led from people within a country .
It ’s not something that can be imposed from outside .
There are minor roles that these institutions can play – providing information , providing basic security – but it ’s extremely unlikely they would be capable of building the required institutions of government … .
For instance in the United States some talk a very aggressive and hawkish line , and there ’s an entire neo-conservative counterculture with its own extremist rhetoric …

Null– Its a Trait .
null– Its an instance of Null - Similar to Java null .
Nil– Represents an emptry List of anything of zero length .
Its not that it refers to nothing but it refers to List which has no contents .
Nothing is a Trait .
Its a subtype of everything .
But not superclass of anything .
There are no instances of Nothing .
None– Used to represent a sensible return value .
Just to avoid null pointer exception .
Option has exactly 2 subclasses - Some and None .
None signifies no result from the method .
Unit–
Type of method that does n’t return a value of anys sort .
Note : Any is supertype of AnyRef and AnyVal .
AnyRef is the supertype of all the reference classes ( like String , List , Iterable ) in scala .
AnyVal is the supertype of all the value classes ( like Int , Float , Double , Byte , Short .. ) .
Null is a subtype of all the reference classes .
null is its only instance .
Nothing is subtype of every other type i.e of reference and value classes .
Think - AnyRef == Object in Java .

TOTTENVILLE - Scholars , philosophers , poets and countless laymen have tried to define the same word since the dawn of time , but to no avail .
The only thing for certain about love - true love , that is - is that it is born surreal , living on as a transcendental force able to survive the darkest of days during the most protracted of periods .
Leonard William Dooren knew that much .
" Sometime while ashore , I pass a couple seated in a car , bench or just strolling , " he wrote in well - trained , methodical cursive on May 26 , 1940 .
" And I can't resist a condescending smile , merging almost to a sense of contempt .
So help me , I feel so superior - they do n't know what love is , not as I know it . "
Yet , some renowned water - going wordsmith Dooren was not .
A U.S. Navy engineer stationed aboard the USS New Orleans during World War II , he was more a fighter than a lover , surviving 17 battles during his tour .
But despite his hellish surroundings and the fear of imminent attack , Dooren could not shake the grip that love had on him .
On that late spring Sunday , he mailed a letter expressing those sentiments .
STIRRED EMOTIONS
A lifetime later , his straightforward , passionate words still have the power to touch those with the hardest of hearts and bring a tear to the eyes of those more tender .
This past June , Tottenville resident Lorraine Alweiss proved to be a member of the latter group .
Looking through ephemera on the Internet , she was searching for a gift for her daughter , Veronica , who now resides in California .
The two were set to take a trip to Hawaii , and Mrs. Alweiss wanted to bring her something special .
So , she put in a search for New Orleans , a location both mother and daughter adored .
The eBay search came back with an interesting looking letter sent from the ship bearing the Louisiana city 's name .
It was postmarked in Pearl Harbor , though .
" I saw that it was sent from Hawaii and was addressed to a woman in New York , " said Mrs. Alweiss . " I thought to myself that this seemed too ( coincidental ) , so I bought it . "
And for $ 3 , the retired school secretary found herself a love story that rivaled any blockbuster novel or film .
The perfectly preserved letter was addressed to Mrs. Edna J. Houghton Van Wert at her Manhattan home .
( In an interesting twist , Mrs. Van Wert was actually born and raised in West Brighton and is buried in the Houghton family plot in Fairview Cemetery in Castleton Corners . )
The four - page letter , from a homesick sailor , begins simply enough , but very quickly becomes an impassioned entreaty .
It was not to his mother that Dooren was writing , but rather to the mother of a girl named Dolly , with whom he had fallen in love with while on leave six months earlier .
He admitted to sitting up at night " dreaming dreams " of Mrs. Van Wert 's daughter and wanting " to do everything in ( his ) power to make Dolly happy . "
The shocker came on page three : Dooren , after detailing his love , admits that he has sold his car and purchased a platinum wedding ring .
The letter ends with a cliff - hanging allusion to an impending visit by Dolly to the base at Pearl Harbor .
" I immediately connected with the spirit of the letter , " said Mrs. Alweiss .
" I felt truly compelled to see how the love story of Len and Dolly evolved .
Did Len survive the war ?
Did they marry ?
Did they have children ? "
It became a quest for information , fueled by love .
Military archives requests , Internet searches and phone calls produced vague results at first , but eventually , Mrs. Alweiss located a Len and Dolly Dooren living in East Greenbush , N.Y .
" I thought at first it might be a son , or grandson even , " she admitted .
" However , their ages were listed as 92 !
I realized that not only had I located some information on the young lovers , but had actually found them both alive and well . "
A SPECIAL REUNION
On the morning of July 20 , Mrs. Alweiss contacted the Doorens by phone , told her tale - much to the disbelief of Mrs. Dooren - and agreed to take a trip upstate to reunite the aging lovers with the letter .
" They could n't have been sweeter or more excited , " she said of her in - person meeting three days later .
As it turns out a few short weeks after the letter was mailed , Dolly took a train cross country to San Francisco , jumped a boat to Hawaii and gave an emphatic " Yes " when Dooren dropped to one knee .
The couple was wed in a judge 's chambers in Honolulu on June 17 , 1940 .
Dooren survived the remainder of his battles , including the fateful bombing of Pearl Harbor , and eventually made his way home with his new bride .
Today , they have five children , six grandchildren and 10 great - grandchildren and are just as in love as the day they met .
" It was adventure from start to finish , " said Mrs. Alweiss of her month - long experience .
" Eventually returning the letter where it belonged was truly amazing . "
In addition to excessive amounts of gratitude for her efforts , she received high praise from the Doorens ' daughter , who told her that she had " enriched the lives of her parents and lives of their family . "
As stories like this go , however , the giver tends to walk away with something almost as invaluable .
" They can say that all they want , " said Mrs. Alweiss , who already has an invitation to the couple 's 70th anniversary party next year .
" But the fact of the matter is , they enriched my life . "
Yale University Press has decided against reprinting the Danish cartoons of the prophet Muhammad in a book examining the controversy , after being advised by Islam and counterterrorism experts that doing so could incite violence .
As well as leaving out the 12 cartoons which provoked riots across the Islamic world in 2006 , Yale also bowed to recommendations not to include any other illustrations of Muhammad , including a 19th century sketch by Gustave Doré of Muhammad in Hell from Dante 's Inferno , in the book , The Cartoons That Shook the World .
Author Jytte Klausen said the book had been ready to go to print when the illustrations were pulled , after Yale received some " quite alarmist " statements from experts who had been sent copies of the proposed images .
A professor of politics at a Massachusetts university , Klausen argued for inclusion of the cartoons in the book , which is due out in November in the US and January in the UK .
" People think they know the cartoons and actually , by printing the cartoons , I 'm arguing that some of them are Islamophobic , and in the tradition of anti-Semitism .
If we can't look at them , how can we discuss this ? " she said today .
She eventually consented – " reluctantly " – to removing them ( she " did n't think it was necessary " ) but " argued every step along the way " against the excision of the other illustrations : the Doré sketch , an Ottoman print showing the Prophet with a veil over his face , and a reproduction of the cover of a Danish children 's book depicting Muhammad .
" You can walk up and down the high street in the UK and pick [ the Doré sketch ] out of antique bins .
The ubiquity of this illustration moved me to want to include it , " she said .
Admitting that it is " quite explicit " – it illustrates the Inferno canto which shows Muhammad with his entrails hanging out – she proposed substitutions : the same scene has been painted by Rodin , Blake and Dali , but these were not accepted .
" Sadness , not anger , characterises my feelings , " said Klausen .
" The cartoons ... one can discuss .
The removal of the other illustrations poses problems for the text , which was written to the illustrations .
I cannot yet judge how confusing it will be to the reader to follow my argument without the illustrations , but for sure these illustrations were intended to awake the reader to the history of depiction of Muhammad in Ottoman , Persian , and Western art - and to show also how we live with images and do not examine them .
Well , they will not be examined this time . "
Yale said in a statement that " as an institution deeply committed to free expression " , it was initially inclined to publish the cartoons and other images as proposed .
However , after considering the fact that republication of the cartoons had " repeatedly resulted in violent incidents , including as recently as 2008 " , it decided to " consult extensively with experts in the intelligence , national security , law enforcement , and diplomatic fields , as well as leading scholars in Islamic studies and Middle East studies " .
" All confirmed that the republication of the cartoons by the Yale University Press ran a serious risk of instigating violence , and nearly all advised that publishing other illustrations of the Prophet Muhammad in the context of this book about the Danish cartoon controversy raised similar risk , " the statement said .
Yale added that it recognised that Klausen 's consent was " with reservations " , and that " inclusion of the cartoons would complement the book 's text with a convenient visual reference for the reader , who otherwise would have to consult the internet to view the images " .
But Sheila Blair , professor of Islamic and Asian art at Norma Jean Calderwood University and one of the authorities consulted by Yale about publication , said she had " strongly urged " the press to publish the images .
" To deny that such images were made is to distort the historical record and to bow to the biased view of some modern zealots who would deny that others at other times and places perceived and illustrated Muhammad in different ways , " she wrote in a letter to the New York Times which is yet to be published .
The president of the American Association of University Professors , Cary Nelson , said in an open letter that the organisation 's members " deplore this decision and its potential consequences " .
" They are not responding to protests against the book ; they and a number of their consultants are anticipating them and making or recommending concessions beforehand ...
What is to stop publishers from suppressing an author 's words if it appears they may offend religious fundamentalists or groups threatening violence ? "
Nelson wrote . "
' We do not negotiate with terrorists .
We just accede to their anticipated demands . '
That is effectively the new policy position at Yale University Press . " .
Klausen has interviewed Middle East politicians , European Muslim leaders , the Danish editors and cartoonists and the Danish imam who kicked off the controversy for the book , which Yale described as " the first comprehensive investigation of the conflict " .
She argues that the Muslim reaction to the Danish cartoons - which included one
depiction of Muhammad with a bomb in his turban – was not a spontaneous emotional reaction , rather that it was orchestrated , " first by those with vested interests in elections in Denmark and Egypt , and later by Islamic extremists seeking to destabilise governments in Pakistan , Lebanon , Libya , and Nigeria " .
" Klausen shows how the cartoon crisis was , therefore , ultimately a political conflict rather than a colossal cultural misunderstanding , " said Yale of the book .

Just caught the last 15 minutes of this game show this afternoon and I was genuinely laughing .
Silent Library is a Japanese game show that MTV picked up .
Like the trailer says , “ the rules are simple . ”
All you have to do is stay quiet and your team collectively wins money .
After some quick research on Wiki and Google , I find a clip from the actual Japanese version .

Some of the Japanese challenges seems more harsh than American challenges .
But , that is what makes Japan , Japan .
I ca n’t wait for the next episode of this Japanese import .
Thank you MTV , for actually entertaining me and going back on the right track of non “ reality ” TV shows .
Next , we should talk about going back to your roots of music videos .
Global Research Editor ’s Note
The following article published by Bloomberg in February confirms that Baxter was involved “ unintentionally ” in the contamination of flu vaccines .
This happened barely two months after the outbreak of the H1N1 swine flu in Mexico in April .
Baxter contaminated vaccine samples with the H5N1 bird flu virus .
Apart from the Bloomberg report , the matter was barely covered by the mainstream press .
This information is crucial , bearing in mind Baxter ’s central role in producing millions of doses of H1N1 vaccines for a number member countries of the WHO .

Baxter Sent Bird Flu Virus to European Labs by Error
By Michelle Fay Cortez and Jason Gale
Feb. 24 ( Bloomberg ) — Baxter International Inc. in Austria unintentionally contaminated samples with the bird flu virus that were used in laboratories in three neighboring countries , raising concern about the potential spread of the deadly disease .
The contamination was discovered when ferrets at a laboratory in the Czech Republic died after being inoculated with vaccine made from the samples early this month .
The material came from Deerfield , Illinois - based Baxter , which reported the incident to the Austrian Ministry of Health , Sigrid Rosenberger , a ministry spokeswoman , said today in a telephone interview .
“ This was infected with a bird flu virus , ” Rosenberger said .
“ There were some people from the company who handled it . ”
The material was intended for use in laboratories , and none of the lab workers have fallen ill .
The incident is drawing scrutiny over the safety of research using the H5N1 bird flu strain that ’s killed more than three - fifths of the people known to have caught the bug worldwide .
Some scientists say the 1977 Russian flu , the most recent global outbreak , began when a virus escaped from a laboratory .
The virus material was supposed to contain a seasonal flu virus and was contaminated after “ human error , ” said Christopher Bona , a spokesman for Baxter , in a telephone interview .
‘ Sanitized ’
Baxter “ moved very quickly to sanitize and protect employees , ” Bona said .
“ Labs have been sanitized , potentially contaminated materials have been destroyed and employees were tested and considered not to be at risk . ”
Baxter gained 93 cents , or 1.6 percent , to $ 58.27 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading , and has lost 2.3 percent over the last 12 months .
The Austrian health ministry reported the incident to the European Union and is conducting its own audit , Rosenberger said .
In response , Baxter said it has put in place “ preventive and corrective ” measures that the ministry found satisfactory .
The vaccine has been destroyed , according to Rosenberger .
The World Health Organization “ is aware of the situation and is consulting with the ministers of health of the countries involved to ensure that all public risks arising from this event have been identified and managed appropriately , ” said Gregory Hartl , a spokesman in Geneva .
European Agencies
The European Medicines Agency has no immediate comment , said Monika Benstetter , an agency spokeswoman .
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , which distributes seasonal flu viruses to companies for vaccine manufacturing , is n’t investigating or providing consultation , said Tom Skinner , a spokesman for the Atlanta - based agency .
The CDC is staying in touch with the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control regarding the incident , Skinner said .
The H5N1 strain of avian flu has been monitored by health officials around the world for more than a decade for signs it could mutate into a form that is easily spread among humans .
Currently , it passes mainly among infected poultry .
A flu pandemic of avian or other origin could kill more than 70 million people worldwide and lead to a “ major global recession ” costing more than $ 3 trillion , according to a worst - case scenario outlined by the World Bank in October .
H5N1 has infected at least 408 people in 15 countries since 2003 , killing 63 percent of them , according to the Web site of the Geneva - based WHO .
Flu Pandemic
BioTest s.r.o , a Czech biotechnology company , was conducting research for a company called AVIR Green Hills Biotechnology using materials supplied by Baxter .
The company was “ supposed to get non-infected testing vaccine , which was by mistake of the supplier contaminated with the H5N1 virus , ” BioTest said in a statement last week .
AVIR Green Hills monitored its lab workers for signs of illness and got access to Roche Holding AG ’s Tamiflu antiviral in case of infections , said Birgit Kofler - Bettschart , a spokeswoman for the closely held , Vienna - based company .
AVIR Green Hills sanitized its laboratories , destroyed potentially contaminated samples , and told health officials , she said in an e-mail today .
Three influenza pandemics , including the 1918 Spanish flu that killed more than 50 million people , have occurred since 1900 .
Threats
Another three pandemic threats — situations where a global epidemic is close to occurring — have occurred .
One was the Russian flu of 1977 .
The H5N1 virus , “ even if it were let out of the lab , would be only lethal for birds in its present state , ” said Ilaria Capua , a veterinary virologist , whose laboratory in Padova , Italy , handles some of the avian - flu screening for the World Organization for Animal Health .
Capua said she has no knowledge of the situation .
“ In Europe , we can react fast ” to outbreaks of the disease in animals , she said .
Baxter , the world ’s largest maker of blood - disease treatments , is one of the companies working on a vaccine to be used in case of a flu pandemic .
The European Medicines Agency recommended approval of Baxter ’s Celvapan , the first cell culture - based vaccine for bird flu in Europe , in December .

Summary
Our inbox has been overrun with messages asking us to weigh in on a mammoth list of claims about the House health care bill .
The chain e-mail purports to give " a few highlights " from the first half of the bill , but the list of 48 assertions is filled with falsehoods , exaggerations and misinterpretations .
We examined each of the e-mail ’s claims , finding 26 of them to be false and 18 to be misleading , only partly true or half true .
Only four are accurate .
A few of our " highlights " :
The e-mail claims that page 30 of the bill says that " a government committee will decide what treatments … you get , " but that page refers to a " private - public advisory committee " that would " recommend " what minimum benefits would be included in basic , enhanced and premium insurance plans .
The e-mail says that " non -US citizens , illegal or not , will be provided with free healthcare services " but points to a provision that prohibits discrimination in health care based on " personal characteristics . "
Another provision explicity forbids " federal payment for undocumented aliens . "
It says " [ g] overnment will restrict enrollment of SPECIAL NEEDS individuals . "
This provision is n’t about children with learning disabilities ; instead , it pertains to restricted enrollment in " special needs " plans , a category of Medicare Advantage plans .
Enrollment is already restricted .
The bill extends the ability to do that .
It claims that a section about " Community - based Home Medical Services " means " more payoffs for ACORN . "
ACORN does not provide medical home services .
The e-mail interprets any reference to the word " community " to be some kind of payoff for ACORN .
That ’s nonsense .
Analysis
This chain e-mail claims to give a run-down of what ’s in the House health care bill , H.R. 3200 .
Instead , it shows evidence of a reading comprehension problem on the part of the author .
Some of our more enterprising readers have even taken it upon themselves to debunk a few of the assertions , sending us their notes and encouraging us to write about it .
We applaud your fact - checking skills and your skepticism .
And skepticism is warranted .

A few readers alerted us to the fact that a state representative in North Carolina , Rep. Curtis Blackwood , published a version of the e-mail in a newsletter to constituents , telling them that while going through e-mail , he came across " some interesting information on the Democrats ’ big health care bill , H.R. 3200 . …
While this is federal legislation and not state , the topic is of enough significance that I thought many of you would be interested in reading it . "
We ’d refer Rep .
Blackwood to our special report on viral messages titled , " That Chain E-mail Your Friend Sent to You Is ( Likely ) Bogus .
Seriously . "
We can trace the origins of this collection of claims to a conservative blogger who issued his instant and mostly mistaken analyses as brief " tweets " sent via Twitter as he was paging through the 1,017 - page bill .
The claims have been embraced as true and posted on hundreds of Web sites , and forwarded in the form of chain e-mails countless times .
But there ’s hardly any truth in them .
We ’ll go through each of the claims in this message :
Claim : Page 22 : Mandates audits of all employers that self - insure !
False :
This section merely requires a study of “ the large group insured and self - insured employer health care markets . ”
There ’s no mention of auditing employers , only of studying “ markets . ”
The purpose of the study is to produce “ recommendations ” to make sure the new law “ does not provide incentives for small and mid-size employers to self - insure . ”
Claim : Page 29 : Admission : your health care will be rationed !
False :
This section says nothing whatsoever about “ rationing ” or anything of the sort .
Actually , it ’s favorable to families and individuals , placing an annual cap on what they could pay out of pocket if covered by a basic , “ essential benefits package . ”
The limits would be $ 5,000 for an individual , $ 10,000 for a family .
Claim : Page 30 : A government committee will decide what treatments and benefits you get ( and , unlike an insurer , there will be no appeals process )
False : Actually , the section starting on page 30 sets up a “ private - public advisory committee ” headed by the U.S. surgeon general and made up of mostly private sector “ medical and other experts ” selected by the president and the comptroller general .
The advisory committee would have only the power “ to recommend ” what benefits are included in basic , enhanced and premium insurance plans .
It would have no power to decide what treatments anybody will get .
Its recommendations on benefits might or might not be adopted .
Claim : Page 42 : The “ Health Choices Commissioner ” will decide health benefits for you .
You will have no choice .
None .
False :
The new Health Choices Commissioner will oversee a variety of choices to be offered through new insurance exchanges .
The bill itself specifies the “ minimum services to be covered ” in a basic plan , including prescription drugs , mental health services , maternity and well - baby care and certain vaccines and preventive services ( pages 27 - 28 ) .
We find nothing in the bill that prevents insurance companies from offering benefits that exceed the minimums .
In fact , the legislation allows ( page 84 ) any company that offers an approved basic plan to offer also an “ enhanced ” plan , a “ premium ” plan and even a “ premium plus ” plan that could include vision and dental benefits .
Claim : Page 50 : All non-US citizens , illegal or not , will be provided with free healthcare services .
False .
That ’s simply not what the bill says at all .
This page includes " SEC .
152 . PROHIBITING DISCRIMINATION IN HEALTH CARE , " which says that " [ e ] xcept as otherwise explicitly permitted by this Act and by subsequent regulations consistent with this Act , all health care and related services ( including insurance coverage and public health activities ) covered by this Act shall be provided without regard to personal characteristics extraneous to the provision of high quality health care or related services . "
However , the bill does explicitly say that illegal immigrants ca n’t get any government money to pay for health care .
Page 143 states : " Nothing in this subtitle shall allow Federal payments for affordability credits on behalf of individuals who are not lawfully present in the United States . "
And as we ’ve said before , current law prohibits illegal immigrants from participating in government health care programs .
Claim : Page 58 : Every person will be issued a National ID Healthcard .
False .
There is no mention of any “ National ID Healthcard ” anywhere in the bill .
Page 58 says that government standards for electronic medical transactions " may include utilization of a machine - readable health plan beneficiary identification card , ” to show eligibility for services .
Insurance companies typically issue such cards already , but if such a standard were issued the cards would need to be in a standard form readable by computers .
The word “ may ” is used to permit such a standard , but it does not require one .
Claim : Page 59 : The federal government will have direct , real - time access to all individual bank accounts for electronic funds transfer .
False .
This section aims to simplify electronic payments for health services , the same sort of electronic payments that already are common for such things as utility bills or mortgage payments .
The bill calls for the secretary of Health and Human Services to set standards for electronic administrative transactions that would " enable electronic funds transfers , in order to allow automated reconciliation with the related health care payment and remittance advice . "
There is no mention of " individual bank accounts " nor of any new government authority over them .
Also , the section does not say that electronic payments from consumers is required .
Claim : Page 65 : Taxpayers will subsidize all union retiree and community organizer health plans ( read : SEIU , UAW and ACORN )
Misleading .
Page 65 is the start of a section ( SEC .
164 . REINSURANCE PROGRAM FOR RETIREES ) that would set up a new federal reinsurance plan to benefit retirees and spouses covered by any employer plan , not just those run by labor unions or nonprofit groups .
Specifically , it covers “ retirees and . . . spouses , surviving spouses and dependents of such retirees ” who are covered by “ employment - based plans ” that provide health benefits .
It ’s open to any “ group health benefits plan that . . . is maintained by one or more employers , former employers or employee associations , ” as well as voluntary employees ’ beneficiary associations ( page 66 ) .
Furthermore , the aim of the fund is to cut premiums , copays and deductibles for the retirees .
Payment “ shall not be used to reduce the costs of an employer . ”
Claim : Page 72 : All private healthcare plans must conform to government rules to participate in a Healthcare Exchange .
True .
This page begins a section setting up a new , national Health Insurance Exchange through which individuals and employers may choose from a variety of private insurance plans , much like the system that now covers millions of federal workers .
Any private insurance plans offered through this exchange must meet new federal standards .
For example , such plans can’t deny coverage for preexisting medical conditions ( page 19 ) .
Claim : Page 84 : All private healthcare plans must participate in the Health care Exchange ( i.e. , total government control of private plans )
Partly true .
Nothing like this appears on page 84 .
No insurance company is required to sell plans through the exchange if it does n’t want to .
Any employer may choose to buy coverage elsewhere .
In fact , the vast majority of employers will still be buying private plans through the normal marketplace , because only employers with 10 or fewer employees are even allowed to buy through the exchange in the first year .
The limit rises to 20 employees in the second year .
However , new plans sold directly to individuals will only be sold through the exchange .
Individuals who currently buy their own coverage can keep those plans if they wish , and if the insurance company continues to offer them .
Claim : Page 91 : Government mandates linguistic infrastructure for services ; translation : illegal aliens
Misleading .
It ’s true that page 91 says that insurance companies selling plans through the new exchange “ shall provide for culturally and linguistically appropriate communication and health services . ”
The author ’s “ translation , ” however , assumes that anyone speaking a foreign language or from another culture is an illegal immigrant , which is false .
Claim : Page 95 : The Government will pay ACORN and Americorps to sign up individuals for Government - run Health Care plan .
False :
This page is the start of “ SEC .
205 . OUTREACH AND ENROLLMENT OF EXCHANGE -ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUALS AND EMPLOYERS IN EXCHANGE -PARTICIPATING
HEALTH BENEFITS PLAN . ” It says a newly established Health Choices Commissioner “ shall conduct outreach activities ” to get people covered by private or government health insurance plans .
The section says on page 97 that the Commissioner “ may work with other appropriate entities to facilitate … provision of information . ”
But there is no authorization anywhere in the entire section for the Commissioner to pay money to any group to engage in outreach .
Claim : Page 102 : Those eligible for Medicaid will be automatically enrolled : you have no choice in the matter .
Partly true .
Page 102 says certain Medicaid - eligible persons will be “ automatically enrolled ” in Medicaid ( which is the state - federal program to provide insurance to low - income workers and families ) IF they are not already covered by private insurance .
That would happen only if they had “ not elected to enroll ” in one of the private plans offered through the new insurance exchanges , however .
So on paper at least , they would have a choice .
Also , it ’s estimated that one in four persons who lacks health insurance is already eligible for Medicaid or its offshoot , the state Children ’s Health Insurance Program , but simply have n’t signed up or been enrolled by their parents .
Claim : Page 124 : No company can sue the government for price - fixing .
No “ judicial review ” is permitted against the government monopoly .
Put simply , private insurers will be crushed .
Half true .
It ’s true that page 124 forbids any review by the courts of rates the government would pay to doctors and hospitals under the new “ public option ” insurance plan .
But there ’s no mention of “ price fixing ” in the bill ; that ’s the e-mail author ’s phrase .
It also remains to be seen if the “ public option ” plan would grow to become a “ government monopoly , ” as the author predicts .
Claim : Page 127 : The AMA sold doctors out : the government will set wages .
Misleading .
Nothing in the bill would “ set wages ” for doctors in general .
Page 127 says the government would ask doctors to accept below - market rates set by the government for their patients who are covered by a new “ public health insurance option , ” just as they now are asked to do so for patients covered by Medicare .
Physicians would still be free to charge what they wish for other patients , and free not to accept patients covered by the new program just as they are now free to refuse Medicare patients .
That ’s not a choice many doctors make , however , so as a practical matter the government would be setting rates ( not “ wages ” ) for many patients .
On the other hand , the new “ public ” plan is aimed mainly at covering people who have no insurance now and can afford to pay doctors little if anything .
Claim : Page 145 : An employer MUST auto - enroll employees into the government - run public plan .
No alternatives .
False .
It ’s true that employers would be required to sign up their workers for coverage automatically , but it does n’t have to be the “ public plan . ”
It would be the employer - offered plan “ with the lowest applicable employee premium ” ( pages 147- 148 ) .
This would only be the " public option " if the employer was eligible to buy coverage through the Health Insurance Exchange ( not likely , at least during the first two years when only small businesses would have access ) , and the " public option " was the cheapest plan ( which would be likely ) .
Furthermore , while the employer is n’t given an alternative , the workers are .
They may reject auto - enrollment under an opt - out provision ( page 148 ) .
Claim : Page 146 : Employers MUST pay healthcare bills for part - time employees AND their families .
Half true .
There ’s nothing in this section about part - time employees ’ families , but this provision does call for employers to contribute toward part - time employees ’ health insurance .
The bill says that “ for an employee who is not a full - time employee … the amount of the minimum employer contribution ” will be a proportion of the minimum contribution for full - time employees .
This proportion will depend on the average weekly hours of part - time employees compared with the minimum weekly hours required to be a full - time employee , as specified by the Health Choices Commissioner .
( For a point of reference :
The minimum contribution for individual plans of full - time employees is not less than 72.5 percent of the premium of the cheapest plan the employer offers . )
Claim : Page 149 : Any employer with a payroll of $ 400 K or more , who does not offer the public option , pays an 8 % tax on payroll Claim : Page 150 : Any employer with a payroll of $ 250 K - 400 K or more , who does not offer the public option , pays a 2 to 6 % tax on payroll .
Both Partly True .
The bill requires employers either to offer private health insurance coverage or pay a percentage of their payroll expenses to help finance a public plan .
The 8 percent payment would indeed apply to employers with payrolls over $ 400,000 in the previous year , and lesser amounts would apply to smaller firms .
Those with payrolls of $ 250,000 or less would pay nothing .
But the penalty is n’t incurred if an employer " does not offer the public option , " as the e-mail claims .
Rather , it ’s a penalty for not offering health insurance to employees .
Claim : Page 167 : Any individual who does n’t have acceptable health care ( according to the government ) will be taxed 2.5 % of income .
True .
This is the mechanism in the bill to enforce the individual mandate requiring everyone to have insurance .
A person who does n’t have insurance that meets minimum benefit standards ( or other acceptable coverage , such as a plan that was grandfathered in ) would pay a penalty of 2.5 percent of modified adjusted gross income for the year .
The total penalty can’t exceed a national average premium for individual coverage , or family coverage if applicable .
Claim : Page 170 : Any NON - RESIDENT alien is exempt from individual taxes ( Americans will pay for them ) .
False .
“ Non-resident aliens ” are generally those who have spent less than 31 days in the U.S. during the year .
The claim that “ Americans will pay for them ” assumes that such visitors would somehow be getting federal benefits that would cost taxpayers money .
In any case , they are not “ exempt from individual taxes ” at all .
Under current law , the Internal Revenue Service says : “ If you are a nonresident alien , you must file Form 1040NR ( PDF ) or Form 1040 NR - EZ ( PDF ) if you are engaged in a trade or business in the United States , or have any other U.S. source income on which the tax was not fully paid by the amount withheld . ”
All that page 170 says is that non-resident aliens who do n’t obtain health coverage do n’t have to pay an additional 2.5 percent federal tax that would apply to U.S. workers who fail to get coverage , or to immigrants who are working here legally under green cards and who fail to obtain coverage .
The tax is spelled out in subsection ( a ) starting on page 167 .
Claim : Page 195 : Officers and employees of Government Health care Bureaucracy will have access to ALL American financial and personal records .
False .
This section of the bill discusses “ Disclosures To Carry Out Health Insurance Exchange Subsidies . ”
It says that government employees of the health insurance exchange will have access to federal tax information for purposes of determining eligibility for affordability credits available for low - and moderate - income Americans .
In other words , in order to qualify for a government subsidy to purchase health insurance , the government needs to confirm your income .
And , no surprise , the government already has access to your federal tax information .
The bill also says nothing about “ ALL … financial and personal records . ”
Instead it says “ Such return information shall be limited to — ( i ) taxpayer identity information with respect to such taxpayer , ( ii ) the filing status of such taxpayer , ( iii ) the modified adjusted gross income of such taxpayer ( as defined in section 59 B ( e ) ( 5 ) ) , ( iv ) the number of dependents of the taxpayer , ( v ) such other information as is prescribed by the Secretary by regulation as might indicate whether the taxpayer is eligible for such affordability credits ( and the amount thereof ) . ”
The bill goes on to limit use of this information “ only for the purposes of , and to the extent necessary in , establishing and verifying the appropriate amount of any affordability credit … and providing for the repayment of any such credit which was in excess of such appropriate amount . ”
Claim : Page 203 : “ The tax imposed under this section shall not be treated as tax . ”
Yes , it really says that .
Misleading .
What this actually says is : “ The tax imposed under this section shall not be treated as tax imposed by this chapter for purposes of determining the amount of any credit under this chapter or for purposes of section 55 , ” which deals with the Alternative Minimum Tax .
It would limit the ripple effects of the new taxes the bill would impose on individuals making over $ 350,000 a year .
Claim : Page 239 : Bill will reduce physician services for Medicaid .
Seniors and the poor most affected .
Claim : Page 241 : Doctors : no matter what specialty you have , you ’ll all be paid the same ( thanks , AMA ! )
Both False .
Both of these claims pertain to Section 1121 , which updates the physician fee schedule for 2010 for Medicare .
It does n’t " reduce physician services for Medicaid " ( which would n’t pertain to seniors anyway ) ; instead it modifies a section of the Social Security Act that defines physicians ’ services .
The section also does n’t say that doctors will be paid the same “ no matter what specialty you have . ”
Instead it sets up two categories of physician services with different growth rates for fees under those categories .
As the Kaiser Family Foundation says of this section of the bill : " Allows the revised formula to be updated by the gross domestic product ( GDP ) plus 2 % for evaluation and management services and GDP plus 1 % for all other services . "
The measure will cost $ 228.5 billion over 10 years , according to the Congressional Budget Office and Joint Committee on Taxation .
Claim : Page 253 : Government sets value of doctors ’ time , their professional judgment , etc .
Misleading .
It ’s true that page 253 refers to “ relative value units ” to be used when determining payment rates for doctor ’s services , and that such RVUs would weigh factors “ such as time , mental effort and professional judgment , technical skill and physical effort , and stress due to risk . ”
But this is nothing new ; the government already uses RVUs when setting rates it will pay under Medicare .
For example , the RVUs assigned to a colonoscopy are currently double the RVUs assigned to an intermediate office visit .
In fact , page 253 is part of a section ( Sec. 1122 ) that sets up a process for correcting existing but “ potentially misvalued ” rates .
Claim : Page 265 : Government mandates and controls productivity for private healthcare industries .
Misleading .
This claim does n’t even make sense .
How can anyone " mandate ” that somebody else be productive , or “ control ” how productive they are ?
The author has simply misunderstood what this controversial item would do .
In fact , page 265 is the start of a section ( Sec. 1131 ) that is among several designed to slow future growth of Medicare payments to help offset the cost of the bill .
It would require that “ productivity improvements ” be taken into account when setting annual “ market basket ” updates to Medicare rates for hospital - based services .
The hospital industry has estimated this would translate into a 1.3 percent cut next year and a total of $ 150 billion in reduced payments over 10 years , and is opposed to it .
Claim : Page 268 : Government regulates rental and purchase of power - driven wheelchairs .
Misleading .
What page 268 does is to stop Medicare for paying for “ mobility scooters , ” which have been widely marketed as a Medicare - financed benefit , leading to ballooning costs to the program .
They would no longer qualify as a “ power - driven wheelchair . ”
Only a " complex rehabilitative power - driven wheel chair recognized by the Secretary ” would be covered .
The Congressional Budget Office estimates this will save the government $ 800 million over 10 years ( see page 2 ) .
Claim : Page 272 : Cancer patients : welcome to the wonderful world of rationing !
False .
This page merely calls for a study of whether a certain class of hospitals incur higher costs than some others for the cancer care they deliver .
It also says the secretary of HHS “ shall provide for an appropriate adjustment ” in payments “ to reflect those higher costs . ”
It ’s hardly “ rationing ” to pay hospitals more to compensate for higher costs .
Claim : Page 280 : Hospitals will be penalized for what the government deems preventable re-admissions .
True :
This does say that “ the Secretary shall reduce the payments ” to hospitals with too many “ potentially preventable ” readmissions of patients that they previously had discharged .
Claim : Page 298 : Doctors : if you treat a patient during an initial admission that results in a readmission , you will be penalized by the government .
False .
That section is part of a list of potential physician - centered approaches to reducing excess hospital readmissions .
The bill states that the secretary of Health and Human Services will conduct a study on the best ways to enforce readmissions policies with physicians .
One of the approaches the secretary must consider is the option to reduce payments to physicians whose treatment results in a hospital readmission .
Another is the option to increase payments to physicians who check up on recently released patients .
Neither of these approaches is mandated in the bill – what ’s mandated is that the secretary consider them , among others .
Claim : Page 317 : Doctors : you are now prohibited for owning and investing in healthcare companies !
False .
It ’s already illegal , with certain exceptions , for doctors to refer Medicare patients to hospitals , labs , medical imaging facilities or other such medical businesses in which they hold a financial interest .
Page 317 would modify an exception to that “ self - referral prohibition ” for rural providers , and says doctors ca n’t increase their stake in an exempt hospital after the bill becomes law .
Claim : Page 318 : Prohibition on hospital expansion .
Hospitals cannot expand without government approval .
False .
Expansion is forbidden only for rural , doctor - owned hospitals that have been given a waiver from the general prohibition on self - referral .
It does not apply to hospitals in general .
The bill provides for exceptions to even this limited expansion ban ( page 321 ) .
Claim : Page 321 : Hospital expansion hinges on “ community ” input : in other words , yet another payoff for ACORN .
False .
Page 321 says rural , doctor - owned hospitals that are exempt from the Medicaid self - referral prohibition can ask to be allowed to expand under rules that must allow “ input ” from “ persons or entities in the community . ”
Under that language , anybody in the community could offer their opinion , but nobody – not ACORN or anybody else – would be paid for it .
Claim : Page 335 : Government mandates establishment of outcome - based measures : i.e. , rationing .
Misleading .
This section does deal with establishing quality measures for Medicare .
It does not make any recommendations for treatment , or empower anyone to make treatment recommendations based on those measures .
The only effect of these outcome - based measures established in the bill would be ranking and potential disqualification of underperforming Medicare Advantage plans – that ’s disqualification of the plans , not of any medical procedures .
Claim : Page 341 : Government has authority to disqualify Medicare Advantage Plans , HMOs , etc .
True .
The bill allows for the possibility of disqualifying underperforming Medicare Advantage plans , which include Medicare HMOs .
Medicare Advantage plans are private health plans that provide Medicare benefits .
Under the bill , the secretary of Health and Human Services has the authority to disallow plans that are providing low - quality care under the new quality measures ( which include evaluations of patient health , mortality , safety and quality of life ) .
If a plan is disqualified , this will not leave seniors without care .
The Kaiser Family Foundation reports that “ virtually all ” Medicare beneficiaries have access to at least two Medicare Advantage plans , and most have access to three or more .
In 2008 , 82 percent of beneficiaries had access to six or more private fee - for - service plans , one type of Medicare Advantage plan ( along with HMOs , PPOs and medical spending accounts ) .
Beneficiaries are also always free to return to the regular Medicare fee - for - service program .
Claim : Page 354 : Government will restrict enrollment of SPECIAL NEEDS individuals .
Misleading .
Insurance companies already restrict enrollment in so - called “ special needs ” plans , a special category of Medicare Advantage plans that were created in 2003 .
Page 354 merely extends the authority to do that beyond the end of next year , when it was set to expire .
Furthermore , what ’s being restricted is n’t the number of patients , but the type of patients .
Plans can be restricted to accepting only those patients who fall into in one or more special categories .
These include those who are institutionalized ( think , nursing homes ) , those who qualify both for Medicare and Medicaid ( think , both low - income and over age 65 ) and those with severe or disabling chronic conditions such as diabetes , emphysema , chronic heart failure or dementia .
And of course , this has nothing to do with children with learning problems .
Claim : Page 379 : More bureaucracy : Telehealth Advisory Committee ( healthcare by phone ) .
Misleading .
The advisory committee would not be a “ bureaucracy ” or have any administrative functions , but instead would bring together experts from the private sector to give advice on how Medicare and Medicaid should treat the practice of medicine via telecommunication , something used in rural hospitals and such places as cruise ships , battlefield settings and even on NASA space missions .
Pages 380-381 call for the committee to consist of five “ practicing physicians , ” two “ practicing non-physician health care workers ” and two “ administrators of telehealth programs . ”
Claim : Page 425 : More bureaucracy : Advance Care Planning Consult : Senior Citizens , assisted suicide , euthanasia ?
Claim : Page 425 : Government will instruct and consult regarding living wills , durable powers of attorney , etc. Mandatory .
Appears to lock in estate taxes ahead of time .
Claim : Page 425 : Government provides approved list of end - of - life resources , guiding you in death Claim : Page 427 : Government mandates program that orders end - of - life treatment ; government dictates how your life ends .
Claim : Page 429 : Advance Care Planning Consult will be used to dictate treatment as patient ’s health deteriorates .
This can include an ORDER for end - of - life plans .
An ORDER from the GOVERNMENT .
Claim : Page 430 : Government will decide what level of treatments you may have at end - of - life .
All False .
These six claims are a twisted interpretation of a provision in the bill that says Medicare will cover voluntary counseling sessions between seniors and their doctors to discuss end - of - life care .
Medicare does n’t pay for such sessions now ; it would under the bill .
End - of - life care discussions include talking about a living will , hospice care , designating a health care proxy and making decisions on what care you want to receive at the end of your life .
Doctors do the consulting , not the " government " or a " bureaucracy . "
The e-mail author ’s assertion that the bill calls for " an ORDER from the GOVERNMENT " for end - of - life plans rests on language about a patient drawing up such an order stipulating their wishes , and having that order signed by a physician .
There ’s nothing about " an order from the government . "
The bill defines an order for life - sustaining treatment as a document that " is signed and dated by a physician … [ and ] effectively communicates the individual ’s preferences regarding life sustaining treatment . "
See our article " False Euthanasia Claims " for more on such assertions .
Claim : Page 469 : Community - based Home Medical Services : more payoffs for ACORN .
False .
This section defines the term " community - based medical home " as a " nonprofit community - based or State - based organization " that " provides beneficiaries with medical home services . "
ACORN does not provide medical home services .
The section goes on to say such a medical service is one that " employs community health workers , including nurses or other non-physician practitioners , lay health workers , or other persons as determined appropriate by the Secretary , that assist the primary or principal care physician or nurse practitioner in chronic care management activities . "
The only thing ACORN has in common with that description is the word " community . "
It ’s a community organization that offers services such as free tax preparation help and first - time home buyer counseling for low - and moderate - income people .
It also works to register people to vote , and a few of its canvassers have been investigated for registration fraud , a point of concern during the presidential campaign .
Claim : Page 472 : Payments to Community - based organizations : more payoffs for ACORN .
False .
This section is referring to community - based medical homes .
Claim : Page 489 : Government will cover marriage and family therapy .
Government intervenes in your marriage .
Half true .
It ’s true that pages 489 and 490 make state - licensed “ marriage and family therapist ” services a covered expense “ for the diagnosis and treatment of mental illnesses . ”
But the therapists would n’t be employed by the government , and there ’s no requirement for anybody to receive their help .
So the claim that this would mean that “ government intervenes in your marriage ” is false .
Claim : Page 494 : Government will cover mental health services : defining , creating and rationing those services .
Misleading .
The provision amends Section 1861 of the Social Security Act laying out what services Medicare will cover .
It expands coverage for mental health services , stipulating that a " mental health counselor " who can perform mental health counseling is someone with a master ’s or doctorate degree , a state license , and two years of practice as a counselor .
Is this the government " defining " mental health services ?
Well , it ’s certainly the government defining what government programs will cover .

The resurgent vinyl market is n't showing any signs of slowing down .
In fact , recent figures released by Nielsen SoundScan indicate that overall U.S. vinyl sales will once again set a benchmark in 2009 , with sales up 50 % through the first five months of the year .
SoundScan predicts vinyl sales will reach 2.8 million units in 2009 , up from 1.9 million in 2008 , a record since SoundScan began tracking sales data in 1991 .
Already in 2009 , vinyl sales have topped 1 million .
At this point last year , vinyl sales stood at 701,000 copies .
To be fair , the number is still tiny compared to overall album sales .
Vinyl , SoundScan points out , accounts for less than 1 % of overall album sales .
In other words , vinyl sales represent about six months in the life of Taylor Swift , whose late 2008 release , " Fearless , " has already sold more than 3.3 million copies .
To date in 2009 , 121.8 million CDs have been sold , versus 33.2 million digital albums , compared to 151.01 million CDs and 27.52 digital albums for the same period last year .
Yet vinyl appears to be a niche market that 's here to stay , and one that 's showing signs of expansion .
Rock albums account for 70 % of all vinyl sold , but country vinyl is enjoying a growth spurt .
Year - to - date country vinyl sales are already at 15,000 copies , compared with 5,000 for the comparable period in 2008 .
Of course , if someone wants to rain on the vinyl good news , there 's this stat : Vinyl sales were up 90 % in 2008 over 2007 , and the rate of growth has certainly slowed .

A young Romanian boy who suffered serious injuries has died
Prague - A Romanian Roma boy died on Monday in a hospital in Prague - Vinohrady , according to the hospital officials .
The 17 - year old son of the Romanian gypsy king almost drowned when swimming in a lake in Stará Boleslav , about 50 km outside Prague 13 days ago .
He was immediately hospitalized but his condition was serious and eventually led to a brain seizure .
About 50 of the boy 's relatives arrived in Prague from Romania to hold a vigil for the youth .
First , they camped in Prague and then moved to a camp outside Prague .
The boy 's body will be taken back to Romania for burial .
The relatives expressed thanks to the Vinohrady hospital doctors .
Meanwhile , the hospital will have to sort out how to cover the costs of the boy 's treatment , which reached up to CZK 1 million .
The boy had on health insurance neither in Romania , nor in the Czech Republic .
Americans have missed one serious correction since the manic stock market took off in March .
Since that time the value of the U.S. dollar , the bedrock of our economic system has fallen a stunning 12.5 percent .
Currencies should not fluctuate this much especially the world ’s reserve currency .
Back in December , I talked about how the U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve were determined to destroy the dollar for the sake of bailing out our massive debt .
The plan in the short run has created a stunning stock market rally that has set the S&P 500 on fire to a 50 percent rally .
In a recession this profound , you do n’t typically turn things around in two years ( the recession started officially in December of 2007 ) .
Yet this appears to be more of a bear market rally since the unemployment picture will remain bleak for months to come .
It is interesting how little coverage the tanking dollar is receiving .
Maybe people are just happy that their stocks are running back up even though P/E ratios are extremely expensive .
Yet the correlation between the dollar going under and stocks rallying is undeniable :
Now you might ask , why at the peak of the panic did the U.S. dollar reach a 3 - year high ?
You have to remember that for almost a year , the notion of decoupling was making the rounds across investment communities .
This idea was based on the premise that the U.S. was going to have a silo like decline while nations around the world somehow prospered with the biggest economy going under .
This had as much merit as believing subprime loans would be a contained issue .
So in late 2008 , the idea was put to rest and people started rushing to safety especially with the implosion of banks like Lehman Brothers and the virtual nationalization of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
In March , investors had enough and the U.S. dollar still reigned supreme as a safe haven .
Since that time , the U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve have done everything possible to crush the dollar rally including committing to buy $ 1.25 trillion in various forms of debt much of it in the form of mortgages and going with quantitative easing .
What happened after this ?
The stock market took off while the U.S. dollar continued a steady decline .
And of course this would only be logical because why would foreigners want to purchase debt that is inherently following a policy of inflation by its issuer ?
U.S. items have become cheaper on a global stage .
For those setting this policy , it makes a lot of sense because they are trying to inject inflation and slowly grow ourselves out of trillions in debt .
U.S. households are still mired in massive amounts of debt :
Now one thing is certain and that is American households are cutting back on debt .
Much of this is happening because of a forced austerity but many are simply choosing to spend less by choice .
And given that most of our borrowing comes from foreigners who hold enormous amounts of our debt , a declining dollar makes the amount we have to pay back that much cheaper .
Now rightfully so , foreigners really do not like this kind of arrangement so the U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve have to walk this trillion dollar debt tightrope .
Their solution ?
Juice the stock market and make saving your money as unattractive as possible for domestic consumers .
Cash for clunkers .
Massive tax rebates for buying homes .
All these are steroids for consumption and over consumption ironically is what led us into this financial crisis .
So should you worry ?
You may be thinking that it would be great if you can simply inflate all your debts away .
That is assuming that the U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve actually succeed in their objective .
Keep in mind , never in the history of our country has the Fed loaded up their books with so much questionable debt :
Source : Zero Hedge
This is unprecedented but the gist of all this is that we can somehow engineer ourselves out of this mess with targeted inflation .
Given the size of the housing and credit bubble it is hard to see how this is even possible .
The average American household is not able to balance this out given the number of rising bankruptcies and record high foreclosures .
The more troubling sign is how our currency is being sacrificed for easy finance for the banking industry .
Many banks are now staying solvent even with bad loans on their books because they are now able to raise money in the open casino ( stock market ) by suspending belief with massaged mark to surreal accounting methods .
The S&P 500 is not up because of earnings .
It is up because of the systematic destruction of the U.S. dollar and massive subsidies to failed banking institutions .
We still have major issues including $ 3 trillion in commercial real estate yet this rally has the wind blowing on its back .
Yet this is a stock bubble engineered by the juice of the U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve .
Those who use steroids usually have it catch up on them .

If I were to tell you about an actor that has worked consistently in major Hollywood movies for over two decades , has worked often with Academy - Award winning writers , actors and directors and has a legion of fans who follow him in all his movies no matter the genre or story , what would your immediate reaction to this person be ?
Would you think “ Wow , this guy must be great .
Twenty years of studio movies , he must be talented ? ”
Based solely on the description of the actor written above , with no names attached , would you ever in your right mind assume that the person was bad at his craft ; that he sucked ?
Chances are you would n’t .
And yet , if after giving you that description I told you the actor was Keanu Reeves , I bet I know what your reaction would be .
“ He sucks ! ”
I just do n’t get it .
In interviews he comes across as an insightful , cerebral , well - rounded person who does n’t mire himself in the vagaries of stardom and never asks for more than he needs .
His co-stars glow about him , and quality directors line up to put him in their movies .
And yet , for some inexplicable reason , he is plagued by this notion that he is dumb .
And that he is untalented .
And I just do n’t get it .
How can he suck if he ’s still making big movies twenty years into his career ?
The majority of his early peers are gone and forgotten ; actors like Christian Slater , Judd Nelson , Emilio Estevez , Andrew McCarthy , et al , and yet here he is coming out with a huge new movie this Friday ( The Lake House ) .
He has survived critical drubbings more severe than he deserves .
He has been heckled and flamed and deplored because he has good looks , but a vacant affectation .
He is perceived as a flat actor , devoid of charisma , empty of emotional depth .
And yet , he ’s still here making big movies .
I have been a fan of Keanu since his Bill & Ted days .
I have defended my love for the man who would be Neo to every one of my friends and family .
I have gotten into screaming matches with people I barely know , just because I heard them bash the man .
And I have never lost an argument about him , because no one can prove that he is n’t a gifted , talented performer .
They lose , because I can prove that he is .
But my arguing stops now .
Once and for all I am going to prove to the world that Keanu Reeves does NOT suck .
And I will prove it to you in 40 point list format .
I promise when you finish reading this piece you will respect , admire and appreciate the talent that is Keanu Reeves .
Let the proving begin …
1 . If you were n’t impressed by Keanu ’s mean , Southern Redneck in The Gift or at least agree he was impressively intense , well then we have nothing to talk about .
Just click the “ X ” and leave this site immediately .
2. Contrary to popular belief , has never won a Razzie Award .
Which is more than I can say for these actors : Halle Berry , Charlton Heston , John Travolta , Bruce Willis , Kevin Costner , Demi Moore , Marlon Brando , Dennis Hopper , Sylvester Stallone , Sharon Stone , Faye Dunaway , Woody Harrelson and Madonna
3 . Without being asked , gave $ 38 Million dollars to The Wachowski Brothers so they could properly finish the Matrix sequels .
$ 38 Million !
Let ’s see Tom Cruise drop that much for one of his clunkers .
4 . Has worked with the following critically acclaimed directors : Francis Ford Coppola , Ron Howard , Bernardo Bertolucci , Gus Van Sant , Sam Raimi , Taylor Hackford , Lawrence Kasdan , Stephen Frears , Richard Linklater
5. “ Whoa ”
6. Keanu ’s name means “ cool breeze over the mountains ” in Hawaiian , which is pretty cool .
Compare that to Jean Claude Van Damme , which is loosely translated in German as “ giant douchebag ” .
7 . The night before he was to shoot his kissing - heavy love scene for A Walk in the Clouds , Keanu took a hockey puck to his mouth , requiring six stitches .
He still showed up the next day for work and shot the scene over the course of six hours .
Let ’s see a pussyboy like Orlando Bloom do that !
Keanu is hardcore .
8 . Showing extreme foresight and good judgment ( which is more than I can say for Sandra Bullock ) , passed on an easy $ 10 million payday to star in Speed 2 , because he did n’t think the script was any good .
And he was right .
Tell me again why people think he ’s stupid ?
9 . Deferred part of his salary on The Replacements ( 2000 ) so Gene Hackman could be cast .
Obviously , the man knows what makes a movie great .
And that would be the Hack Man .
10 . Has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame .
They do n’t just give those out , you know .
11 . A personal quote : “ I ’m a meathead , man .
You ’ve got smart people , and you ’ve got dumb people .
I just happen to be dumb . ”
At least the man is brave enough to admit who he is .
12 . Is not nearly as stiff , wooden or stupid as Paul Walker .
13 . Has starred in six $ 100 Million grossing movies .
Which is more than the following actors who many claim are “ better ” than Keanu : Johnny Depp , George Clooney , Russell Crowe , Leonardo DiCaprio , Colin Farrell , Richard Gere , Hugh Grant , Ethan Hawke , Val Kilmer , Jude Law , Matthew McConaughey , Sean Penn , Joaquin Phoenix , Tim Robbins , Kevin Spacey , Vince Vaughn , Dennis Quiad and Al freakin’ Pacino !
14 . Almost never shows up in tabloids , an extremely welcome quality considering the glut of media whores we have today ( ahem , TomKat ! ) .
15 . Yeah , it gave people the impression he ’s an idiot , and no , it ’s not Shakespeare , but c’mon , who does n’t love Bill & Ted ’s Excellent Adventure !
16 . “ I am an F - B - I Agent ! ” That line rules .
17 . Decided to leave his band “ Dogstar ” so that the rest of the group would not be held back by his celebrity or by his busy schedule .
Which is more than I can say for a few other jackass actors / wannabe rockers ( ahem , Russell Crowe ) .
18 . Managed to keep a straight face all the way through the abysmally crappy Sweet November .
That takes talent people .
19 .
Has worked with the following Academy Award winning actors : Al Pacino , Gene Hackman , Rachel Weisz , Charlize Theron , Jack Nicholson , Diane Keaton , Marisa Tomei , Morgan Freeman , Anthony Hopkins , Emma Thompson , Denzel Washington , Anthony Quinn , Kevin Kline , William Hurt , and the guy who played Bill in Bill & Ted ’s .
I ’m pretty sure he ’s won a couple Oscars by now .
20 . Is “ The One ” .
Warrants mentioning .
21 . Knows his acting limitations and in doing so , does not try to overextend himself in roles he could n’t do ; which means not only are his movies better , but so are the ones he turns down .
He ’s making movies he ’s NOT EVEN IN better !
Someone please give it up for this man !
22 . Does not own a computer .
So you know what that means … is not a MySpace whore .
23 .
In his review for Speed , Roger Ebert had this to say about Keanu : “ Keanu Reeves has never had a role like this before .
In fact , in his previous film , he played the mystical Prince Siddhartha , and generally he tends toward dreamy , sensitive characters .
That ’s why it ’s sort of amazing to see him so cool and focused here , a completely convincing action hero who is as centered and resourceful as a Clint Eastwood or Harrison Ford in similar situations . ”
24 . Has made movies in every single genre .
25 . He played Buddha .
No , I ’m serious , “ the ” Buddha .
Between playing the freaking Buddha and playing a stoner in Bill & Ted ’s , why do people think he has no range ?
26 . Back in the 80’s , he taught stoners of the world something about history ( and brought Napoleon to Waterlube ) .
Also , I ’d be remiss if I did n’t add that he ’s totally non , non non , non non , non , non heinous .
27 .
And despite being viewed as a “ stoner ” , has never been pigeonholed on screen .
In his various film roles , he has played : an FBI agent , a cop , a serial killer , a lawyer , a doctor , a dentist , the One , a Quarterback , a musician , an ad exec , a nuclear physicist ( hello ! ) , a redneck , a soldier , the freakin ’ Buddha , a gay hustler , and a Dog Boy .
28 . He knows kung fu .
So , you know , do n’t screw with him .
29 .
When Keanu decides to do a sequel : Bill & Ted ’s Bogus Journey .
When Keanu decides not to do a sequel : Speed 2 .
Can this guy pick winners , or what ?
30 .
Is none of the following : a Scientologist ( Tom Cruise ) , a john ( Hugh Grant ) , a drug addict ( Robert Downey Jr. ) , a cheat ( Jude Law ) , a phone - thrower ( Russell Crowe ) , hard to work with ( Val Kilmer ) or a mean bastard ( Sean Penn ) .
31 . Besides his obvious acting talents , Keanu also : surfs , rides motorcycles , was a good enough hockey goalie to earn the nickname “ The Wall ” , performs Shakespeare , reads philosophy , plays guitar in a slew of rock bands , ballroom dances , horseback rides , and “ knows ” kung fu .
Is there anything he ca n’t do ?
32 . His name is actually pronounced “ kay - ah - nu ” , not “ key - ah - nu ” , and yet never makes a fuss out of it ( ahem , DEMI ! ) .
33 .
Has romanced on - screen : Charlize Theron ( twice ) , Sandra Bullock ( twice ) , Monica Bellucci ( twice ) , Rachel Weisz ( twice ) , Carrie - Anne Moss ( thrice ) , Diane Lane , Connie Nielson , Dina Meyer and Uma Thurman .
This does not necessarily prove his specific level of suckage , but it does prove that hot actresses want to bang him on - screen , which is an important quality in today ’s movie stars .
For example , nobody wants to nail Adam Sandler , and he ’s not nearly as good an actor as Keanu , even if you count Punch - Drunk Love twice .
34 . Was in the Pilot episode of the awesome short - lived Jay Mohr show , Action .
And since that show ruled all , he in turn , receives a percentage of the ruling .
Let ’s say 17 % .
35 .
To his everlasting credit , never made a cameo appearance on Will & Grace , which makes him only one of five movie stars in the world never to have done so .
36 .
Was the host for a documentary show called “ Children Remember the Holocaust . ”
He supports the faith , I support him .
37 .
Has a college class based around his movies .
“ The Films of Keanu Reeves ” at the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena , CA .
Name another supposedly “ sucky ” actor that has a college class named after him ?
That ’s right , you can ’t , because Keanu ’s the only one .
Because he kicks ass AND educates the youth of tomorrow .
38 . Turned down the Val Kilmer role in Heat to do a production of Hamlet in Canada .
If I have n’t said it before , let me say it now , the man is devoted to his craft .
He works on it , he tries new things .
He keeps working .
Even if you think he ’s not getting better , at least he ’s trying .
How many movie stars keep pushing themselves after they hit it big ?
How many just coast along on generic roles and unspectacular performances ?
Keanu pushes himself .
Fuck all to his limitations , he pushes himself and I respect him for it .
39 .
British theater critic Roger Lewis of the Sunday Times in London ( who knows something about Shakespeare , after all he is British ) had this to say about Keanu ’s Winnipeg - based performance of The Prince of Denmark in Hamlet : “ He quite embodied the innocence , the splendid fury , the animal grace of the leaps and bounds , the emotional violence , that form the Prince of Denmark .
He is one of the top three Hamlets I have seen , for a simple reason : he ‘ is ’ Hamlet . ”
40 .
Brought unto the world the phrase “ Bogus , dude ” , for which we are all eternally grateful .
Now tell me , after reading this piece , do you still think he sucks ?
I did n’t think so .
Bangarang !
