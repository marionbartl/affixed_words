Dec. 18 , 2008 -- Actor Jeremy Piven has ended his role in the Broadway revival of the David Mamet play Speed - the - Plow after being diagnosed with a " high mercury count . "
Mercury is an element found throughout the environment .
High levels of exposure to mercury can harm the brain , heart , kidneys , lungs , and immune system of people of all ages , especially fetuses , according to background information from the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) .
WebMD spoke with Carlon Colker , MD , FACN , FACSM , who is treating Piven .
Colker is the chief executive officer and medical director of Peak Wellness Inc. in Greenwich , Conn. , and Beverly Hills , Calif .
Does Piven have mercury poisoning ?
" The word poisoning implies some surreptitious act , like we poison rats , " Colker tells WebMD .
" The proper term is mercury toxicity .
And the answer is ' yes ' to mercury toxicity . "
Colker says Piven 's original mercury level was " shockingly elevated " at nearly six times the upper tolerable limit and the highest Colker had ever seen in his practice .
" You can imagine how stunned I was , " Colker says .
The Green Grid is a member - run organization that focuses on improving the efficiency of what 's become a major energy sink : corporate datacenters .
The group , which includes both vendors and users of datacenter hardware , has had great success with an earlier measure of datacenter efficiency , called Power Usage Effectiveness , that helped determine which fraction of a facility 's power budget went to running the actual hardware .
Now , it 's working on providing some measures of how efficiently that hardware is working .
The Green Grid's Mark Monroe ( who has a day job with Sun Microsystems ) talked to us about the new efficiency measures and other news that 's being announced at the group 's annual meeting .
Monroe said the Grid is building on what it considers the success of the earlier Power Usage Effectiveness measure , which is simply the total power used by a facility divided by the power that runs the actual computing hardware .
Despite its simplicity , the measure effectively captures the efficiency of things like the climate control equipment that keeps the compute hardware humming along safely .
" The impact of having a metric , " Monroe said , " is that , over time , people are starting to focus on it . "
You can see that in some of the healthy competition between Google and Microsoft over their datacenters ' PUE numbers .
The next obvious step , Monroe said , is to have a good metric that tracks how much useful work the hardware is performing with the power budget .
It 's already provided a measure , called DCeP , that attempts to do so , but the procedure for obtaining a DCeP value was far more complex than the easy - to - use PUE metric , so the Grid is now focused on providing its users with a set of proxy measurements that , while not as accurate as a DCeP , are far easier to obtain , and thus potentially more useful .
A document describing a set of eight proposed proxies has been posted on the Green Grid Web site .
The proposed proxies cover a lot of ground , in part because useful work can be a very slippery thing to define .
Outbound data might be a reasonable measure of a Web server 's efficiency , but it makes no sense for something that 's hosting a backup archive or a compute cluster .
As such , the Green Grid expects it will accept several of the proposed proxies after receiving feedback on their use .
So , for example , one of the proposed proxies simply divides the total bits flowing through outbound routers by the total power use , while another uses SPECint_rate as the basis for the calculation .
But two of the more intriguing measures show how widely the concern with datacenter power use has spread through the industry .
One relies on the recently developed SPECpower measurement , which allows manufacturers to rate the power efficiency of specific hardware configurations ; the DCeP proxy would simply involve summing the figures for the datacenter 's hardware list .
Intel has also provided the Green Grid with an SDK called Productivity Link , which developers can incorporate into their applications ( Intel has made power consumption a focus ) .
After implementing five functions with an estimated ten lines of code , their applications can report in on how they 're performing .
The SDK contains scripts for drawing reports standard server apps that will run on Solaris , OS X , Linux , and Windows ; if the API is n't implemented , the scripts will default to checking various processor - level performance registers .
Obviously , the results can't really be compared between proxies , but they could definitely help a facility track its performance over time as the mix of equipment changes , and test how things like virtualization and different air conditioning practices influence the datacenter 's performance .
The new efficiency measures are just one of the efforts directed to giving companies a better sense of how to improve datacenter power use .
Monroe also highlighted a recent whitepaper that the group produced on the use of virtualization as a driver of efficiency , and highlighted a number of new initiatives that are being announced at the annual meeting .
Several of these involve collaborations between the Green Grid and the US government .
The grid is now hosting a site developed by the Department of Energy as part of an expanding partnership .
One of the DOE 's labs will help in evaluating the different DCeP proxies , and the Department is developing maps of the potential for free cooling of datacenters — plug in a zip code to an online Web app and the desired temperature and humidity , and the site will tell you how many days a year you can skip running the air conditioning while staying within the parameters , along with how much money that will save .
The group is also working with the EPA to help finalize the first Energy Star standards for datacenter equipment .
It no longer seems necessary to expend much effort to convince anyone involved in enterprise IT that getting an energy efficient data center is an economic necessity , but it may still be necessary to help managers decide what the best place to start is , and provide ways of measuring progress .
The steadily expanding arsenal of tools should help integrate energy efficiency measures into every stage of IT planning .
Vladislav Kern recently introduced us to the USSRPhoto collection of Soviet KGB spy cameras .
He also introduced us to the lovely Victoria , but that 's a whole other story .
Many of the KGB 's cameras were clever hacks , like the ingenious movie camera disguise that allowed users to covertly shoot photos of subjects standing directly beside them .
The inner workings of a standard Super 8 movie camera were replaced with a tiny F - 21 Electronic camera positioned with the lens aimed toward a window in the right side of the case .
I had the same problem with the mouse of my PC , I got a new mouse and the problem was gone .
Try deleting or reinstalling the driver otherwise time to get the hardware fixed .
Correction to this article
THE miracles of nature are everywhere : on landing , a beetle folds its wings like an origami master ; a lotus leaf sheds muddy water as if it were quicksilver ; a spider spins a web to entrap her prey , but somehow evades entrapment herself .
Since the beginning of time , people who have thought about such things have seen these marvels as examples of the wisdom of God ; even as evidence for his existence .
But 200 years ago , on February 12th 1809 , a man was born who would challenge all that .
The book that issued the challenge , published half a century later , in 1859 , offered a radical new view of the living world and , most radical of all , of humanity 's origins .
The man was Charles Robert Darwin .
The book was “ On the Origin of Species ” .
And the challenge was the theory of evolution by natural selection .
Since Darwin's birth , the natural world has changed beyond recognition .
Then , the modern theory of atoms was scarcely six years old and the Earth was thought to be 6,000 .
There was no inkling of the size of the universe beyond the Milky Way , and radioactivity , relativity and quantum theory were unimaginable .
Yet of all the discoveries of 19th - and early 20th - century science — invisible atoms , infinite space , the inconstancy of time and the mutability of matter — only evolution has failed to find general acceptance outside the scientific world .
Few laymen would claim they did not believe Einstein .
Yet many seem proud not to believe Darwin .
Even for those who do accept his line of thought his ideas often seem as difficult today as they were 150 years ago .
The origin of the Origin
The idea of evolution by natural selection is not hard to grasp .
It just requires connecting some uncontentious propositions .
These are that organisms vary from one another , even within a species , and that new variation can arise from time to time ; that some of this variation is passed from parent to offspring ; and that more individuals are born than can exist in the available space ( or be sustained by the available resources ) .
The consequence is what Darwin described in his book as a “ struggle for existence ” .
The weakest are eliminated in this struggle .
The fit survive .
The survivors pass on their traits to their offspring .
Over enough time , this differential transmission of characters will lead to the formation of a new species .
Darwin was neither the first to recognise these simple ideas nor to put them together .
Thinkers as far back as Empedocles , a Greek philosopher born in 490BC , are known to have suggested that natural selection might explain why animals were adapted to their surroundings .
The idea of the struggle for existence has been traced as far back as al - Jahiz , a Muslim theologian and scholar born in Basra around 776 .
And the idea crops up again in the works of Thomas Hobbes , a 17th - century philosopher , and Erasmus Darwin ( Charles 's grandfather ) , who lived in the 18th .
By the beginning of the 19th century , the idea of evolution was in the air .
There was an emerging acceptance that species were unstable .
The botanists could see it in their hybrids .
But what was missing was the mechanism .
At the start of the 19th century Jean - Baptiste Lamarck , a French naturalist , thought he had found it .
He recognised that species were mutable , and he also proposed that traits could be inherited .
His error was to suppose that individuals lost characteristics that they did not need in life and developed ones that they did — and that it was these changes that were passed to their offspring .
A giraffe , for example , might grow a longer neck because it was useful for eating food that other giraffes could not reach .
Its progeny would then inherit the attribute .
It was a nice idea , but Lamarck was wrong .
Acquired characteristics cannot be transmitted in this way .
In the end , the answer came not from biology but from economics .
In 1798 Thomas Malthus wrote “ An Essay on the Principle of Population ” .
Malthus argued that natural populations grow at an exponential rate , whereas the increase in food supply is linear .
In other words , more individuals are born than can possibly survive .
His book popularised what was , in fact , an old idea , at just the right time for biology .
After reading Malthus , both Darwin and Alfred Russell Wallace , a British naturalist , independently put the pieces of the puzzle together and dreamed up evolution by natural selection .
They both saw what Lamarck had failed to , that the struggle for existence in a crowded world , with its winners and losers , was the force that would ensure the survival of the plants and animals carrying the best traits .
Darwin's autobiography records his eureka moment : “ I happened to read for amusement Malthus on population , and being well prepared to appreciate the struggle for existence … it at once struck me that under these circumstances favourable variations would tend to be preserved , and unfavourable ones to be destroyed .
The result of this would be the formation of new species . ”
The first to see selection
It turns out , though , that even Darwin and Wallace were not the first to put the pieces together .
In 1813 William Charles Wells , a Scottish doctor , had presented a paper on race to the Royal Society , in which he introduced the idea of natural selection to explain why people might vary in skin colour in different climates .
And in 1831 Patrick Matthew , a Scottish landowner , provided a description of natural selection in an appendix to a book about growing the best trees to make warships .
Nevertheless Darwin and Wallace are remembered , whereas Wells and Matthew are not , because they made the idea explicit and both wrote papers devoted to it .
These they presented to the Linnean Society in London in 1858 .
Darwin , moreover , is more famous than Wallace because he had devoted the previous two decades to the painstaking accumulation of evidence in support of the theory from areas as diverse as embryology , artificial breeding , geography , economics and geology , and so was able to go into print the following year with “ On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection , or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life ” , to give the book 's full title .
Darwin's theory explained why species were so well adapted to their environment and how new species would form .
It suggested that all living things were related , from the beetle to the lotus , and that everything descended ultimately from a single common ancestor .
Evolution thus removed the need for divine explanations of diversity and , along with evidence emerging at that time of the extreme age of the Earth , it further suggested that the wider universe might also owe nothing to divine intervention and everything to natural laws .
Darwin understood all of this and was greatly troubled .
That trouble continues today .
In the United States a Gallup poll conducted last year found that only 14 % of people agreed with the proposition that “ humans developed over millions of years ” , up from 9 % in 1982 .
Acceptance of evolution varies around the world , with the most ardent believers being in Iceland , Denmark and Sweden ( see chart ) .
In general , as you might expect , a country 's belief in evolution is inversely correlated with its belief in God .
But there is an interesting twist .
Gregory Paul , an independent researcher on evolution , and Phil Zuckerman , a sociologist at Pitzer College in California , have argued controversially that a belief in God is inversely correlated with the level of what might be described as the intensity of the struggle for existence .
In countries where food is plentiful , health care is universal and housing is accessible , people believe less in God than in those countries where their lives are insecure .
A belief in God , and rejection of evolution , they suggest , is most valuable in those societies that are most subject to Darwinian pressures .
Making science work
Be that as it may , many aspects of modern science could not work without accepting evolution .
Darwin's ideas touch every corner of biology and medicine .
They have also had an impact farther afield , in areas from art to politics .
And their impact has been practical as well as theoretical .
Both software engineers and drug developers , for example , often make use of evolutionary thinking when designing their products .
Economics , too , may be helped by Darwin .
Ideas about “ rational ” economic man are being overturned by new ones from a discipline called behavioural economics .
Rather than assuming that individuals faced with economic decisions will comport themselves in what “ classical ” economists regard as a rational manner — ie , to maximise their future wealth — behavioural economics tries to study how real people actually behave .
What is surprising is the degree to which human beings are not rational , and how the reasons for this are likely to involve Darwinian explanations .
Take , for example , a phenomenon called the endowment effect , which is the tendency most people have to value objects they already own more highly than similar ones they have never owned — and , consequently , to be more reluctant to trade them than a classical economist would predict .
Because this effect has been observed in three primate species , most recently in a study of chimpanzees , it suggests this effect has evolutionary roots .
Its strength seems to relate to the evolutionary salience of the item in question .
People may be reluctant to trade goods related to food and mating because in the recent evolutionary past it meant parting with a known object in exchange for an uncertain proposition .
Another example of economic behaviour that may have deep evolutionary roots is the “ herd ” mentality that contributes to financial bubbles .
In the past , copying the neighbours would have been helpful — in order to avoid danger or to find food .
In today 's financial systems , however , it can create instability .
The instinct to follow the herd can be rationalised as rational , so to speak , since everybody benefits in the short term by forcing the price up .
But it does not look so rational when the instability is exposed by an external shock and the market crashes .
In fact , at least part of what seems to be going on is that everyone instinctively feels compelled to copy the others , rather than making an independent assessment of the situation .
Whether the mystery is why people are so averse to risk , unable to estimate the time needed for a given task , or give different answers to the same question depending on how it is framed , there is a fair chance that the explanation will , at some point , involve evolution .
To understand human behaviour properly , the world needs Darwin .
Some have said it is the best idea that anyone ever had .
If it is n't , it certainly comes close .
Despite so much evidence , evolution remains difficult to accept because it implies everything living is largely accidental .
Stephen Jay Gould , an American evolutionary biologist , who died in 2002 , argued that misunderstandings about Darwinism were rife not because the theory is difficult to understand but because people actively avoid trying to understand it .
He thought a misunderstanding about progress was the problem .
Completing the revolution
People are comforted by the idea of a designed and harmonious natural world , with themselves at the top .
It is hard to accept that such harmony has arisen as an accidental consequence of a brutal system with no principles beside the one that every individual is striving for reproductive success .
It is depressing to think that life is purposeless and that evolution has no higher destination .
This criticism applies to many believers in evolution who are not actually workers in the field , as well as those who reject the theory .
It is a commonly held view that evolution implies progress , even among those who believe in natural selection .
Most biologists disagree .
They argue , along with Gould , that evolution has no fixed direction .
A creature can become fitter by getting more complex .
But it can also become fitter by getting simpler .
It all depends on the circumstances .
The undoubted increase in average complexity in the fossil record is , according to this view , an accident of the fact that life started simple and therefore had only one direction to go in .
Changes that lead to complexity are more obvious than those that lead to simplicity , since they create something that was not there before .
This does not mean , however , that they are more numerous .
Gould 's view was thus that the evolution of human intelligence while not exactly an accident , since it was a response to a long series of circumstances , was certainly not a foregone conclusion .
If that series of circumstances had been even slightly different , there would have been no egg - headed Homo sapiens .
That view is being questioned .
For example , in a study published last year in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences a group of researchers looked at crustaceans ( crabs , shrimps , woodlice and so on ) over the past 550 m years and found far more examples of groups of species evolving towards complexity than in the other direction .
Matthew Wills of the University of Bath , in England , commented at the time that it was the “ nearest thing to a pervasive evolutionary rule that 's been found . ”
In this study , the only crustaceans that became simpler were either parasites or those living in remote habitats , such as isolated marine caves .
Simon Conway - Morris , a palaeontologist at Cambridge University , in England , is the champion of a new interpretation of evolution — one that challenges the view that it is largely governed by the accident of circumstances .
Unlike Gould , he thinks that if evolution were replayed from the beginning , a lot of things would turn out the same .
Dr Conway - Morris has arrived at this view from a detailed study of what is known as convergent evolution .
Darwin himself was intrigued by this phenomenon , in which different groups of organisms independently evolve similar solutions to similar problems , whether these solutions are teeth , eyes , brains , ecosystems or societies .
Where other biologists have noted such convergences as “ remarkable ” , Dr Conway - Morris believes they actually tell a broader story .
His argument is that , given the nature of physics and chemistry , there may be only a limited number of ways in which things can work .
Evolution will be channelled into these successful paths , and thus does have trends .
Two of these , he thinks , are towards complexity and intelligence .
He adds that things “ do n't just happen in chemistry ” .
They happen because of pre-existing causes .
Whether it is the molecules of crystallin that are used to build an eye or the haemoglobin that makes blood carry oxygen , the nature of molecules themselves means that evolution is more likely to follow a path determined by their basic structure .
Evolution is a mechanism , and it works within rules .
Dr Conway - Morris 's view of the world may or may not turn out to be correct .
If it is , it may prove more palatable to some people than the current interpretation of the biological world as ultimately materialist and purposeless .
Darwin himself was deeply troubled by his materialist thoughts and what they meant .
He considered how thoughts and emotions were simply secretions of the brain .
From his correspondence it seems his religious beliefs never reached a fixed position , but he was sensitive to the extent to which his ideas could upset others .
He even devised a diplomatic answer that avoided challenging the existence of God .
When asked about the origins of emotions , instincts and degrees of talent , he noted , “ say only they are so because brain of child resembles parent 's stock ” .
More to know
Dr Conway - Morris is not convinced by Gould 's arguments .
He thinks there is unfinished business to deal with .
On the source of moral systems and consciousness , he says , “ we are nowhere near an answer ” .
In his world , science can explain the beetle , the lotus leaf and the spider 's web , but not why they appear beautiful to people .
Others think that the explanation is memes , the cultural equivalent of genes in which ideas replicate through the human desire to imitate .
In some ways , though , it does not matter whether humanity 's evolution was entirely random or was predictable in its general form .
For people do , now , have a united evolutionary common purpose : to halt that natural selection in its tracks .
The species has evolved to the point where it understands itself , and can seek to escape the brutal handcuffs of nature and end the struggle for existence .
The beginning of that understanding was provided by Darwin , and the application of Darwinism will be an important part of the process .
That gives people every reason to celebrate his 200th birthday .

In the name of God , the Compassionate the Merciful .
O God , hasten the reappearance of the Hidden Imam and grant him health and victory and make us his true companions and believers and those who testify to his rightfulness .
. .
The new US government has announced that it wants to create change and follow the path of talks .
It ’s very clear that true change should be fundamental and not tactical .
It ’s clear that the Iranian nation will welcome genuine changes .
The Iranian nation is prepared to talk .
However , these talks should be held in a fair atmosphere in which there is mutual respect .
Cont ’d ( click below or on “ comments ” )
They have said that they want to fight terrorism .
The Iranian nation has been fighting terrorism for the past 30 years .
If you truly want to fight terrorism come and cooperate with the Iranian nation , which is the main victim of terrorism , so that terrorism is uprooted .
We can give you the addresses of terrorist dens in some European countries , the lands occupied by the Al - Quds occupying regime ( Israel ) and some other countries which in fact have good relations with you .
Of course , we think that it ’s very unlikely that you do n’t have this information .
If you want to dry the roots of aggression and murder , let ’s put those behind the recent wars in the Persian Gulf and the Middle East , on trial and sentence them together .
Everyone knows that Saddam ( Husayn ) was not the only person who caused the wars .
Since the attack by Mr Bush ’s government some one million people have been killed and a few million people have been displaced .
In order to uproot insecurity , those behind these killings including Mr Bush , his allies and government , have to be put on trial and sentenced .
( Chants of indistinct slogans from the masses in support of the president ’s comments )
If you want to uproot crime , join the Iranian nation and other nations and let ’s put the criminal leaders of the Zionist regime on trial and sentence them together ( chants of indistinct slogans from the masses ) .
If you want to genuinely fight against the proliferation of atomic weapons and weapons of mass destruction , you have to join Iran and help it so that it can show you the right way .
Yes , atomic weapons and weapons of mass destruction are a serious threat .
They have to be destroyed .
The Iranian nation is the victim of chemical weapons and weapons of mass destruction .
However , the only way ( to counter them ) is to implement justice and suitable planning .
It ’s clear that the measures which have been taken up until now to destroy atomic weapons have been ineffective .
If they are interested in destroying these weapons and if they genuinely want the world to become a peaceful place , they must resort to rational and just methods .
We told them that their behavior in Iraq was wrong but they did n’t listen .
As a result , these atrocities occurred and Mr Bush ’s government was humiliated .
If they truly want to establish genuine security , let ’s reform the fundamentals of the UN ’s structure , which is the source of oppression and discrimination and is incapable of establishing security , together and establish justice there .
If you genuinely intend to uproot drugs , you should ask the Iranian nation , which has sacrificed more than 3,300 martyrs in its fight against drug smuggling ( to help ) .
Of course , this development is in need of fundamental changes to their approach and behavior .
We hope that this happens .
The world is not interested in the repetition of the dark ages created by Mr Bush .
We do n’t even want the American nation to be humiliated and have a bad reputation .
I believe that the fate of Mr Bush , who has the worst reputation in our contemporary history , should be a lesson to all of those who wish to dominate the world and impose themselves on other nations .
Of course , some try to repeat that experience but in another shape , they must know that a fate worse than that of Mr Bush awaits them ( chants of indistinct slogans ) .
The Iranian nation is the friend of regional nations and governments .
Even though Iran is a great power , it is the brother of other nations , especially those in the region .
Praise be to God , today the Iranian nation has brotherly and friendly relations with other regional nations .
The enemies do n’t like us to have such relations .
They are determined to put some of the region ’s governments against other nations by imposing certain measures and behavior and humiliate and belittle them in the minds of other nations and make them an accomplice in their crimes .
I would like to give them this friendly and brotherly advice and that is that some of them made the same mistake during the first decade of the revolution when Saddam was carrying out atrocities against the Iranian nation .
Then they regretted it .
Of course , the Iranian nation was gracious and never showed off to them .
As a brother , I would like to say to them that it ’s to their advantage to be careful of satanic temptations and those created by the Zionists and imperialistic governments .
It ’s in your interest to support your own people .
The Iranian nation is by your side and supports you .
You have to be in the service of your own people .
You should have been by the side of your people during the Gaza incidents .

Sometime back , I posted how to solve the Monty Hall problem with a million doors .
Christophe Poucet wondered if I was making a mistake in my solution : maybe I was not ensuring that the host is not opening a door with a car .
I did not think so , but then I have been wrong in the past .
So , I wanted to check my solution .
First I thought of using QuickCheck to test if the host function was correct , but that would mean that I write a test property and then call it to check that everything was correct .
And then make sure that there was no difference between the test and the main problem .
But I am lazy , and wanted an easier solution .
Enter the assert function from Control .
Exception .
I just made two changes in my previous program .
I added a new import import Control .

Double randomVariable strategy = do u <- nature c <- contestant h <- host ( options u c ) let r = assert ( all ( \d -> open u d == Goat ) h ) $ reward u ( strategy c h ) return r
recompiled the code , and voila , no error messages .
This means that my reasoning was correct .
And now I can assert that my reasoning is correct .

SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) -- California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said late Friday the state could lose up to $ 3 billion in 2009 because of an ongoing three - year drought .
Schwarzenegger declared a state of emergency because of the state 's water shortage .
Under the declaration , the governor directed state agencies to implement a water reduction plan and conservation actions and urged California residents to reduce their water use by 20 % .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
In a sign that job losses are felt in every corner of the nation , unemployment rates rose in 98 % of metropolitan areas across the country in December , according to a recent government report .
The Labor Department reported that the unemployment rates in 363 of 369 metropolitan areas rose in December 2008 , compared with the same month in the prior year .
In November , 364 of 369 areas reported higher unemployment rates .
According to the report , 168 areas reported jobless rates of at least 7 % , compared with just 33 a year ago , and 40 areas reported rates that were higher than 10 % .
Just 22 metropolitan regions had unemployment rates that were under 4 % , down from 112 last year .
A total of 95 regions registered unemployment rates that were at least 3 percentage points higher than a year ago .
Not one region had a jobless rate decrease of more than 0.2 percentage point during that period .
Though the rise in unemployment rates depicts the rampant job losses facing the country , the Labor Department does not adjust the rates in its metropolitan unemployment report for typical seasonal changes in employment .
Furthermore , smaller cities are usually dependent on a fewer number of employers , so layoffs can exacerbate those areas ' unemployment rates .
El Centro , Calif . continued to hold the highest rate of unemployment at 22.6 % .
The town on the border of Mexico is highly reliant on agricultural employment , according to economists .
The unemployment rate has a tendency to rise and fall in the area depending on the farming season .
Morgantown , W.Va. , had a rate of just 2.7 % , the lowest in the country .
Morgantown houses West Virginia University , which is the town 's largest employer .
The University has a large hospital and pharmaceutical manufacturing component - areas of the economy that are actually adding jobs .
Of the 49 metropolitan areas with a population of at least 1 million , Detroit had the largest unemployment rate , at 10.6 % , followed by San Bernadino , Calif. , with 10.1 % .
Detroit 's labor force has been slammed by dreadful auto sales , and the sinking California housing market has dragged down construction jobs in that area .
Oklahoma City had the lowest unemployment rate of large metropolitan regions , at 4.6 % , followed by Washington at 4.7 % .
Oklahoma
City is benefiting from the still - booming energy industry , especially through the several large natural gas companies in the city .
Washington 's employment is largely based on federal government jobs in the district .
The report comes on the same day as two independent reports showed job cut announcements and payroll reductions continued to rise in January .
The Labor Department is expected to report Friday that the economy lost another 500,000 jobs , according to a consensus estimate of economists surveyed by Briefing.com .
The national unemployment rate is expected to rise to 7.5 % from its current level of 7.2 % , its highest rate since January 1993 .
This walkthrough is for people who want to win .
It will tell you how to do a thing which , while not technically cheating , is usually considered an exploit .
Overview
The strongest class to play is the wizard , if you ’re lucky or exploiting .
They start with random magic equipment , and a sometimes that stuff is great .
You want to be an elf for the 20 max int .
You want to be female , because the only difference between males and females is that females can lay eggs while polymorphed into some forms .
( As an aside , you can modify your settings file to automatically generate characters of that type , but I ’ll assume you have n’t )
What to do
You want to start with good stuff .
You usually wo n’t .
What you ’ll do is repeat the following steps :
Start a game as a female elf wizard
Decide that her starting inventory is unworthy
Abandon the character and start over
How to do it
Memorize the keystrokes that back out of the inventory screen , leave the dungeon and end the game , generate a new female elf wizard , and open her inventory .
Do n’t feel too bad for your legions of abandoned girl - elves .
They were probably going to get murdered by tentacle demons in the dungeon , with a crap inventory like this .
This way , the worst punishment they ’ll get for their chronic unpreparedness is a well - deserved facesmack when their elf husbands home to an empty dinner table .

The payoff
Once you ’re good at that , the cycle for abandoning a character and generating a new one takes about one second .
Note that copying this character sequence to the clipboard and pasting it into your terminal wo n’t work ; the terminal is unresponsive during some parts of the above .
Alternatively , you could write a script to automate this .
If you were to do that , you can set a higher standard for starting equipment .
Either way , you need your standards to be nonzero but still achievable before the heat death of the universe .
Here are my recommendations , based on experience :
Without an automated script :
A spellbook of identify
An intelligence of at least 18
With an automated script :
A spellbook of identify
An intelligence of at least 19
A ring of slow digestion
And you ’re off !
The spell identify is the most powerful spell in the game , if you take into account the difficulty of casting the more high - end spells like Finger of Death and Polymorph .
You can now use it to find out whether that shiny necklace is going to save your life or strangle you to death !
You ’ll still have to cast it successfully several times before you can #enhance its success rate up to 100 % .
Hey , everything takes practice .

Legislators in conference committee have reportedly reached agreement on a final $ 790 billion stimulus package , and while some details of the final broadband subsidy package are still being hammered out , word from the Hill is that a " network management " amendment proposed by Sen.
Dianne Feinstein ( D - CA ) will not be included in the final bill .
Content industries had reportedly pressed for the inclusion of language offered by Feinstein that would " allow for reasonable network management practices such as deterring unlawful activity , including child pornography and copyright infringement " — language that net neutrality advocates feared would open the door to automatic filtering of copyrighted content by ISPs .
Art Brodsky of the advocacy group Public Knowledge , which opposed the amendment , tells
Ars that it was a " heavy lift to begin with because she filed the amendment , but it did n't come up for discussion during the floor debate .
Then she tried to get it in as part of a managers package on the senate floor along with a bunch of other stuff , but that was n't included for procedural reasons . "
He warns , though , that the " network management " language seems to have been left out largely because of the rush to reach agreement , and may return as a separate proposal at some later point .
Other details of the final bill remain unclear .
The House version of the stimulus bill provided $ 6 billion for broadband deployment , split between the National Telecommunications and Information Administration and the Department of Agriculture , while the Senate version allocated $ 7 billion ( cut from an earlier $ 9 billion ) to be administered by NTIA .
A source on the Hill tells
Ars that some details are still being finalized , but the amount coming out of conference appears to be closer to $ 6 billion , the majority of which will go to NTIA , with a smaller amount allocated to Agriculture .

Could n’t the food that warm - blooded animals burn to stay toasty be put to better use ?
( Image : Ted Kinsman / Photolibrary.com )
See a gallery of thermal images of warm - and cold - blooded animals
IF YOU stopped eating today , you would n’t survive more than two months .
A crocodile , on the other hand , might live for a year or more .
Why the difference ?
You waste most of the food you eat generating heat .
The evolution of warm - bloodedness , or endothermy , is one of life ’s great mysteries .
Sure , there are some advantages – staying active in the cold , keeping young cosy and warm , and avoiding having to go out into the open to soak up heat from the sun .
The thing is , you could get much the same advantages by turning up the heat only when and where in the body it is needed , as many animals do .
So why do most birds and mammals keep the furnaces burning 24/7 ?
Staying warm – which for birds means 40 °C on average – comes at a price .
Some warm - blooded animals have to eat as much in one day as similarly sized reptiles do in a month , a dangerous and time - consuming strategy .
Wasteful lifestyle
Biologists have long struggled to understand why we mammals and our feathery cousins are warm - blooded .
The standard explanation is that it evolved in small carnivores to enable an active , predatory lifestyle .
Last year , however , a radical new idea was put forward : warm blood evolved not in carnivores but in herbivores , as a way of balancing their nutrient requirements .
Though it is early days , this idea could explain not only why we have such an apparently wasteful lifestyle , …
It ’s been a long while since I posted any kind of Java 7 update so I thought maybe it was time in case you have n’t been paying attention .
It seems that the dam broke at Devoxx in December .
We got some clear direction on the expected timeline and what features will be in and out .
There will be a Java 7 preview build available by JavaOne 2009 and theoretically an official Java 7 by January of 2010 .
I say theoretically because there still seem to be a lot of question marks to fill in pretty quickly .
The Java modularity story got turned upside down yet again .
JSR 277 bit the dust and JSR 294 was revived .
Project Jigsaw was announced as part of the new focus on modularizing the JDK rather than providing tools for modularizing your apps .
This gives
Sun a bit more flexibility to work outside the JCP but makes the general applicability a bit more ambiguous .
Subsequently , there has been some new and vigorous discussion on the JSR 294 mailing lists where the observer list has been opened to writing .
Alex Buckley has provided some initial proposals and Peter Kriens has added a proposal on nesting .
Project Jigsaw has been approved .
It appears that communication lines are open and work is proceeding .
In the language space , we learned that most importantly closures will not be included in Java 7 .
Java 7 will also NOT include property support , reified generics , operator overloading , and BigDecimal syntax .
That leaves us with the opportunity for a few well - defined , high - value changes and Joe Darcy owns a new Project Coin to accept and process those proposals .
At this point some of the most considered are :
A number of polls have now happened to collect information on possible language changes and the null - handling and exception enhancments seem to score consistently high .
I agree that these would definitely help but they are small changes .
In the library space , it seems that JSR 203 ( NIO2 ) , JSR 308 ( Annotations on Types ) and some portion of JSR 166 ( Concurrency updates ) will definitely be included .
JSR 166 has started to narrow down exactly what will be included and the current proposal is the fork / join library but NOT the ParallelArray portions .
Java 7 likely will include TransferQueues , Phasers , ConcurrentReferenceHashMap , and possibly a Fences API of some sort .
Many of these will seem esoteric to most developers but several are of critical importance to those writing concurrency code .
One of my favorite JSRs , JSR 310 ( Date and Time ) announced in December that they were running behind and might not make it in time for Java 7 .
It seems that many people have stepped up to help out based on the mailing list but there is still work to be done .
If you have some knowledge in this space or even can just try out the API for your own needs and provide feedback , that would help a lot .
In the Swing space , it seems that JSR 295 ( Beans Binding ) is out , JSR 296 ( Swing Application Framework ) is in , and JSR 303 ( Bean Validation ) is ambiguous . :)
JSR 303 recently completed their public review and have collected a lot of feedback from the community but it ’s unclear to me what the thinking is from Sun on it .
The new G1 garbage collector seems to finally be reaching stability and will be ported back to JDK 6 in JDK 6u14 in May .
G1 is a new concurrent garbage collector designed to take the place of CMS , which many people find problematic .
It ’s great to have another option in GC .
Last but certainly not least , things are hopping in support for dynamic languages .
John
Rose is coordinating a whole bunch of sub- projects proceeding in parallel and it ’s a feast for JVM - based language implementors .
Projects include dynamic invocation , lightweight method handles , lightweight bytecode loading , interface injection , tail calls , continuations , and more .
Surely not all of these will make it into Java 7 but some will and they will allow language implementors to do more and do it faster .
From a future - looking perspective , these changes are crucial and will allow the JVM to continue to be a place to build great new languages .
All in all , it ’s great to see things start to shape up for Java 7 !
I know some people are disappointed that closures and other features wo n’t be included .
Personally , I think there is a lot of great and compelling stuff here if you ’re currently running on Java and the innovative work being done on the JVM makes it a solid choice for new and existing languages moving forward .
Yes , it ’s finally here !
But maybe not what you expected …
By gOS ( Good OS alternatively ) the idea is to move most if not all applications to the Cloud .
I ’m guessing that ’s why they called it “ Cloud OS ” ;) .
A real Google OS or Google Operating system might not be far down the road .
I ’m sure Richard Stallman would have a fit , but for the rest of us , it may be one step closer to true decentralization when it comes to computing .
You can set aside the speculation now , and just enjoy the screenshots ….
Looks like a cross between Mac OS and a Linux system running the Enlightenment window manager .
WASHINGTON  Senate Republicans on Wednesday forced a one - week delay in a vote on the nomination of Eric H. Holder Jr. as attorney general , denying President Obama the chance to have a key member of his national security team in place as planned .
Mr. Holder ’s ultimate confirmation still appears all but assured .
But the procedural delay led Democrats and Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee to accuse each other of souring the spirit of bipartisanship that Mr. Obama ’s inauguration was supposed to signal .
Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania , the ranking Republican on the committee , has led the opposition to Mr. Holder ’s nomination .
Mr. Specter said Wednesday that Republicans had been denied the time to raise important questions , a charge that his Democratic counterparts deny .
CANNABIS PSYCHOSIS
Dr Brian Boettcher Consultant Psychiatrist Shelton Hospital , Shropshires Community & Mental Health Services NHS Trust , Bicton Heath , Shrewsbury , SY3 8DN
Introduction
The drug induced psychosis seen when Cannabis is the main substance being abused is distinct phenomenologically from other psychosis .
It is unusual for such a psychosis to occur without other drugs being involved to some extent and so it is difficult to tease out the differences between the effects of Cannabis and other drugs .
However it is misleading and dangerous , to our youth in particular , to label Cannabis as soft .
In fact the serious adverse effects of Cannabis have been known for some time now and Hall and Solowij in the British Journal of Psychiatry sounded warnings in 1997 about such issues as dependence on Cannabis , adolescent developmental problems , permanent cognitive impairment as well as involvement in and the development of psychosis . [ 1 ]
There are suggestions that in a small number of cases Cannabis is capable of precipitating psychosis , going on to the chronic picture described below , in people who have had no family and personal history of psychiatric illness .
There have been suggestions that such people may be the ones who have started Cannabis in their teens and caused disturbance to neural connectivity .
However , it seems Cannabis can precipitate or exacerbate a schizophrenic tendency in a characteristic manner . [ 2 ]
ACUTE SYMPTOMS OF CANNABIS PSYCHOSIS
International Classification of Diseases ( ICD - 10 )
Often the combination of symptoms makes one suspicious that schizophrenia is present but at the same time there is an affective component .
There may be the suspicion that the condition , either in part of whole , is feigned for reasons that are unclear because the pattern of symptoms do not fall easily into the usual criteria for psychosis .
Drug taking is often denied , or the amount that is admitted by the patient is so little that one cannot say that this accounts for the current symptoms .
Worse still , patients may not even consider Cannabis as an illicit or dangerous drug and so do not mention using it .
Hallucinations are vague and delusions may be transitory with little in the way of thought disorder .
There is often a lack of volition and a history of gradually deteriorating social ability and contact with others , including significant others .
This history will often be verified by relatives and close friends who may be either completely ignorant of the drug taking , or confirm that there has been some in the past but believe that there has been little drug taking recently .
There is often a depressive component with suicide attempts in the past but nothing recent or , if there is , then they are only ineffectual pleas for help .
The person has usually lost his or her job some months or weeks before due to their poor performance at work .
There is often very poor memory and concentration , which may be marked at the time of presentation .
Paranoid delusions may be present and quite severe which can be the most alarming psychotic feature and result in hospital admission .
If confronted with aggressive and authoritarian staff , who indicate verbally or non-verbally , that they do not believe the patient , the patient may become violent or simply leave against medical advice .
There is a slow and gradual effect of cannabis and the symptoms continue to worsen for some time after the person stops using it .
Thus by the time of presentation the person may be so disorganised and confused that they cant even arrange their next cone or joint .
Over the following few days the symptoms ease quickly .
The improvement is easily credited to the neuroleptics and / or the antidepressants , which may in fact have contributed to the improvement .
Symptoms such as the paranoia , hallucinations and depression fade until the patient is allowed to go on leave from the hospital and , a worsening of the symptoms may follow this .
More often than not the nursing staff are the first to become suspicious that drugs have been taken when the patient is on leave from the hospital .
It could even be that the drug screen only indicated small dose drug taking or even absent .
The International Classification of Disease indicates the following symptoms due to Cannabis .
 There must be dysfunctional behaviour , as evidenced by at least one at of the following :
(1) Apathy and sedation
(2) Disinhibition
(3) Psychomotor retardation
(4) Impaired attention
(5) Impaired judgement
(6) Interference with personal functioning .
C. At least one of the following signs must be present :
(1) Drowsiness
(2) Slurred speech
(3) Pupillary constriction ( except in anoxia from severe overdose , when pupillary dilatation occurs )
(4) Decreased level of consciousness ( e.g. Stupor , coma )
F12.0 Acute intoxication due to use of cannabinoids F12.0 DCR - 10
A . The general criteria for acute intoxication ( F1x.0 ) must be met .
B . There must be dysfunctional behaviour or perceptual disturbances including at least one at least one of the following :
(1) Euphoria and disinhibition
(2) Anxiety or agitation
(3) Suspiciousness or paranoid ideation
(4) Temporal slowing ( a sense that time is passing very slowly , and / or the person is experiencing a rapid flow of ideas )
(5) Impaired judgement
(6) Impaired attention
(7) Impaired reaction time
(8) Auditory , visual or tactile illusions
(9) Hallucinations , with preserved orientation
( l0 ) depersonalization
( 11 ) derealization
( 12 ) Interference with personal functioning
increased appetite
dry mouth
conjunctival injection
tachycardia .
[ 3 ] DSM IV also has similar but less complete information under the heading of Cannabis Induced Psychotic Disorder and refers the reader to a general description of  Sunstance­Induced Psychotic Disorder .
That is the difference in the phenomenology of Cannabis Psychosis and other substance induced psychosis is not made , however this is now rather dated being 1994 when published . [ 4 ]
It can be seen from this that the range of symptoms is quite extensive and not confined to the core symptoms mentioned at the beginning .
CHRONIC SYMPTOMS OF CANNABIS PSYCHOSIS
Patients are left with the well - recognised and permanent symptoms of memory loss , apathy , loss of motivation and , paranoid ideation .
These symptoms known as  the Amotivational Syndrome in the past are usually permanent .
[ 5 ]
If Cannabis using resumes then the acute symptoms redevelop .
The chronic state can also be arrived at without a preceding psychotic episode .
After Cannabis started to be widely used about 20 years ago , for permanent damage to occur it was felt by some that Cannabis had to be heavily used over at least three years [ 6 ] .
However , there is accumulating evidence that smaller amount will do damage also and in animals  deficits on tasks dependent on frontal lobe function have been reported in cannabis users  [ 7 ] .
It is very difficult to conduct research in this area , as it is not acceptable to harm humans by doing trials with damaging substances such as Cannabis .
However there is accumulating evidence of the psychological consequences of using Cannabis [ 8 ] .
It is logical that to get the permanent  Amotivational Syndrome small amounts to damage have to accumulate incrementally .
All this is in addition to the recognised danger of a recurrence of a pre-existing illness , such as Schizophrenia or Manic - depressive disorder .
There are suggestions that Cannabis  caused schizophrenia in young people and ( or ) enhanced the symptoms , especially in young people poorly able to cope with stress or in whom the antipsychotic therapy was unsuccessful . [ 9 ]
Caspari found patients with previous cannabis abuse had significantly more rehospitalizations , tended to worse psychosocial functioning , and scored significantly higher on the psychopathological syndromes " thought disturbance " ( BPRS ) and " hostility " ( AMDP ) .
These results confirm the major impact of cannabis abuse on the long - term outcome of schizophrenic patients  . [ 10 ] P

When packing and moving , it is easy to forget certain things that you need immediately at your destination .
You do n’t have to rummage through your packed boxes to find your toothbrush and deodorant .
Instead , pack separate bags to store the items you need on the first day .
One of the hardest things to do is organize all your boxes , even if they are not in the same place .
You also need to find a reliable mover like San Francisco movers that will bring your things to your new home .
Label Your Boxes
This can be done quickly with a color - coded system that allows you to look at your boxes and instantly know which room your content belongs to .
With color - coded boxes , it can not only be helpful to take stock of what is in each box , but it can also be easy to see where to go and which room to move into .
When you move , you know which boxes need to be in the most accessible place to unpack and be in the back of the stack for a few days .
Make sure you label your boxes according to the time you want to unpack them and label each box with a drawn key that tells you where to go .
You want to unpack used items regularly first , but not all at once .
Declutter
Take a day to search all the rooms , cabinets , cupboards , and drawers and donate everything you no longer need .
It can be as simple as going through the wardrobe and trying to find things in your house that you no longer need , or as complex as carefully packing and moving .
Just like in the closet , there is no point in going from one room to another , trying and finding what you need , so carefully pack and move .
Secure Your Cabinet Drawers
So when you are preparing to move , look at your furniture and see if it can be removed , and if so , remove it and put it in a particular bag or box , or use duct tape or plastic wrap to keep it from falling off .
However , if you miss one of the supports , you can end up adding a piece of cardboard to prevent your dining table from toppling over on one side .
Bottom Line
Now that you know all these hacks , you are ready to move like a pro and read them to see which ones you can use for your next move .
When you unpack at your new location , you will be much better organized , and you may find that the move will be cheaper , but you will also be more less stress when you move to your new home . …

The developers of the open source Amarok audio player launched version 2.0 last month with a completely new user interface and a lot of really impressive new features .
Although the 2.0 release delivered some great stuff , it was missing some important features from the 1.4 series .
The first point update since the 2.0 release , version 2.0.1.1 , was announced yesterday .
It addresses a security issue and also brings back a nice assortment of features , including support for searching and filtering playlists and queuing songs .
Several additional features for web music services and portable audio devices have been implemented and many bugs have been fixed .
A few other highlights include enhanced Librivox functionality and support for sorting collections by composer .
Cross - platform compatibility got a little boost in this release , too .
Growl is now used for notifications on Mac OS X and the Windows version is now described as " usable " .
The developers are working on a lot of more significant changes that we could see in the 2.1 release .
Leo Franchi recently wrote about some ideas to improve the usability of the context view and Nikolaj Hald Nielsen has written about a new bookmark system and playlist improvements .
For more details about version 2.0.1.1 , check out the official release notes .
The source code and various installers are available from the project 's web site .

Quick reality check about how deeply the IT security industry is despairing against the targeted malware problem .
In this particular instance , credit card data from a payment processor ( a broker between someone like “ Amazon ” and someone such as “ Visa ” ) was tapped .
The trojan that did this was hidden in “ unallocated portions of server disk drives ” .
Two forensic teams brought in to investigate the problem did not find it even after it was clear that something was fishy .
In the very end they spotted it because it left temporary files lying around carelessly ( in other words , only because the malware author blew it ) .
Well , folks , that ’s how it is .
That ’s the truth .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Record - setting Olympic champion Michael Phelps has been banned for three months by USA Swimming amid controversy over a photograph published in a British newspaper purportedly showing him smoking marijuana .
Slideshow ( 8 images )
Phelps ’s financial support has also been cut off for the same three - month period , the sport ’s national governing body said in a statement on its website ( www.usaswimming.org) on Thursday .
“ This is not a situation where any anti-doping rule was violated , but we decided to send a strong message to Michael because he disappointed so many people , particularly the hundreds of thousands of USA Swimming member kids who look up to him as a role model and a hero , ” the federation added .
“ Michael has voluntarily accepted this reprimand and has committed to earn back our trust , ” the statement said .
The photograph , said to have been taken at a November party at the University of South Carolina , was published by British tabloid newspaper News of the World last Sunday .
Phelps accepted the ban , saying he understood USA Swimming ’s “ point of view , ” the swimmer ’s spokesman Drew Johnson said .
“ He feels bad he let anyone down , ” Johnson added .
“ He ’s also encouraged by the thousands of comments he ’s received from his fans and the support from his many sponsors .
He intends to work hard to regain everyone ’s trust . ”
Phelps has repeatedly apologized for the incident and said he may backtrack on his plans to compete at the London Olympics in 2012 .
The International Olympic Committee said his apology was proof of his sincerity and the world swimming ’s governing body FINA is also backing the embattled swimmer .
Phelps has won 14 career Olympic gold medals , making him the most successful competitor since the modern Olympics began 113 years ago .
ACLU : ' Secret courts ' conceal fraud by military contractors Muriel Kane
Published : Thursday January 15 , 2009

This A law originally intended to encourage whistleblowers may have been used by the Bush Justice Department to cover up allegations of fraud by contractors such as Halliburton spin - off KBR .
In 2007 , David Rose 's " The People vs. the Profiteers " described a " scandal of epic proportions " involving the alleged suppression of dozens of lawsuits against KBR for alleged massive fraud in Iraq .
Those and similar charges are the basis for a complaint ( pdf ) filed on Thursday by the American Civil Liberties Union and the ACLU of Virginia , which alleges that secrecy provisions added to the False Claims Act ( FCA ) in 1986 have been used to keep complaints under seal indefinitely and gag whistleblowers who might otherwise speak out .
" Secret courts and secret proceedings have no place in this country , " stated ACLU attorney Chris Hansen .
" There are plenty of procedures Congress or the courts could adopt to preserve the interest of privacy when it is warranted without enlisting the courts in a blanket scheme that automatically gags people who have information about possible abuse of taxpayer dollars . "
The complaint seeks a ruling that the secrecy provisions violate both the public 's First Amendment rights and the inherent power of the courts to determine proceedings on a case - by - case basis .
Under the 1986 provisions , FCA complaints are automatically filed under seal until the Justice Department decides whether to pursue them , which can take anything from 60 days to several years .
This practice was adopted in order to avoid tipping off defendants who might already be under criminal investigation , but is mandatory even when there is no such need for secrecy .
Meanwhile , the whistleblower who filed the claim is also under a gag order and prohibited from speaking out , leaving the public with no way of knowing that a case has even been filed .
There were about a thousand FCA cases under seal as of 2007 , and some cases have been sealed for as long as nine years .
FCA gag orders may have also been used to cover up cases involving public safety .
" There are circumstances where a confidentiality seal is essential , but Justice has used it as a blanket gag order under threat of criminal prosecution to lock in secrecy sometimes for years , " explained Tom Devine of the Government Accountability Project .
" That is defensible for cases solely concerned with financial recovery , " Devine continued , " but disastrous when a whistleblower challenges fraud that threatens health and safety , such as toxic dumping .
As a result , we must warn those whistleblowers that by filing a False Claims
Act lawsuit , they may seal a cover up until it is too late to protect the public . "
In what is believed to be a first - ever procedure , surgeons at Johns Hopkins have successfully removed a healthy donor kidney through a small incision in the back of the donor ’s vagina .
“ The kidney was successfully removed and transplanted into the donor ’s niece , and both patients are doing fine , ” says Robert Montgomery , M.D. , Ph.D. , chief of the transplant division at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine who led the team that performed the historic operation .
The transvaginal donor kidney extraction , performed Jan. 29 on a 48 - year - old woman from Lexington Park , Md. , eliminated the need for a 5 - to - 6 - inch abdominal incision and left only three pea-size scars on her abdomen , one of which is hidden in her navel .
Transvaginal kidney removals have been done previously to remove cancerous or nonfunctioning kidneys that endanger a patient ’s health , but not for healthy kidney donation .
Because transplant donor nephrectomies are the most common kidney removal surgery — 6,000 a year just in the United States — this approach could have a tremendous impact on people ’s willingness to donate by offering more surgical options , ” says Montgomery .
“ Since the first laparoscopic donor nephrectomy was performed at Johns Hopkins in 1995 , surgeons have been troubled by the need to make a relatively large incision in the patient ’s abdomen after completing the nephrectomy to extract the donor kidney .
“ That incision is thought to significantly add to the patient ’s pain , hospitalization and convalescence , ” says Montgomery .
“ Removing the kidney through a natural opening should hasten the patient ’s recovery and provide a better cosmetic result . ”
Both laparoscopies and transvaginal operations are enabled by wandlike cameras and tools inserted through small incisions .
In the transvaginal nephrectomy , two wandlike tools pass through small incisions in the abdomen and a third flexible tool housing a camera is placed in the navel .
Video images displayed on monitors guide surgeons ’ movements .
Once the kidney is cut from its attachments to the abdominal wall and arteries and veins are stapled shut , surgeons place the kidney in a plastic bag inserted through an incision in the vaginal wall and pull it out through the vaginal opening with a string attached to the bag .
Montgomery says the surgery took about three and a half hours , roughly the same as a traditional laparoscopic procedure .
The Jan. 29 operation is one of a family of new surgical procedures called natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgeries ( NOTES ) that use a natural body opening to remove organs and tissue , according to Anthony Kalloo , M.D. , the director of the Division of Gastroenterology at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and the pioneer of NOTES .
The most common openings used are the mouth , anus and vagina .
Since 2004 , successful NOTES in humans have removed diseased gallbladders and appendixes through the mouth , and gallbladders , kidneys and appendixes through the vagina .
Recently , Kalloo says , some medical experts have called for more studies to compare the safety and effectiveness of NOTES against traditional laparoscopies , which also leave very small scars , have been in use for many years , and are proven to be safer and less painful for patients than older “ open ” abdominal procedures .
He supports more studies .
But , he adds , “ natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery is the final frontier to explore in making surgery scarless , less painful and for obese patients , much safer . ”
An organ donor , in particular , is most deserving of a scar - free , minimally invasive and pain - free procedure . ”

Several science fiction writers made money writing porn — back in the days when porn was still a source of income , in the days before alt .sex.stories and such .
One of my friends whom I asked for suggestions mentioned Robert Silverberg — who supposedly wrote a porno book every two weeks , under pseudonyms like Don Elliott .
Also , Rina Weisman quotes Barry N. Maltzberg as saying one porn book paid for his house .
So whom did I leave out ?
Instead , however , he offered a plan that was clearly both too small and too heavily reliant on tax cuts .
Why ?
Because he wanted the plan to have broad bipartisan support , and believed that it would .
Not long ago administration strategists were talking about getting 80 or more votes in the Senate .
Mr. Obama ’s postpartisan yearnings may also explain why he did n’t do something crucially important : speak forcefully about how government spending can help support the economy .
Instead , he let conservatives define the debate , waiting until late last week before finally saying what needed to be said  that increasing spending is the whole point of the plan .
And Mr. Obama got nothing in return for his bipartisan outreach .
Not one Republican voted for the House version of the stimulus plan , which was , by the way , better focused than the original administration proposal .
In the Senate , Republicans inveighed against “ pork ”  although the wasteful spending they claimed to have identified ( much of it was fully justified ) was a trivial share of the bill ’s total .
And they decried the bill ’s cost  even as 36 out of 41 Republican senators voted to replace the Obama plan with $ 3 trillion , that ’s right , $ 3 trillion in tax cuts over 10 years .
So Mr. Obama was reduced to bargaining for the votes of those centrists .
And the centrists , predictably , extracted a pound of flesh  not , as far as anyone can tell , based on any coherent economic argument , but simply to demonstrate their centrist mojo .
They probably would have demanded that $ 100 billion or so be cut from anything Mr. Obama proposed ; by coming in with such a low initial bid , the president guaranteed that the final deal would be much too small .
Such are the perils of negotiating with yourself .
Now , House and Senate negotiators have to reconcile their versions of the stimulus , and it ’s possible that the final bill will undo the centrists ’ worst .
And Mr. Obama may be able to come back for a second round .
But this was his best chance to get decisive action , and it fell short .

GOP punishing members who cross party lines Rachel Oswald
Published : Tuesday February 24 , 2009
Print This Email This Determined to enforce the party line , the GOP has taken new steps to punish those members who have crossed the aisle in recent weeks to vote in support of the federal stimulus package and to send the message to any party moderates - turncoats will not be tolerated .
In a Monday interview with Fox News ' Neil Cavuto , Republican National Committee Chair Michael Steele said he was open to primary challenges to the three Republican senators who voted in favor of the federal stimulus package -- Arlen Spector of Pennsylvania and the two senators from Maine , Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe .
Spector is up for re-election in 2010 .
" My retribution is the retribution of the voters in their state .
They 're going to have to go through a primary in their state , " Steele said , adding that the RNC would follow the lead of the state parties in choosing which Republicans to back with campaign money .
" When the state party says we 're going to endorse a candidate , the RNC is behind them .
When the state party says we have a problem with them , so does the RNC . "
Today the National Republican Congressional Committee will be unveiling its new campaign fundraising program for the 2010 elections .
Called the " Patriot " program , the plan will among other things hold members accountable for their votes if they wish to recive any campaign aid , reports Roll Call 's John McArdle .
Writes McArdle , " As one Republican source put it Monday , the effort is also designed to 'end the welfare state that the NRCC has become over the past six to eight years ' by setting strict benchmarks for Members and adding one big stick to the process .
Namely , those candidates who arent working to help themselves will be cut off from NRCC financial assistance . "
" We have very limited resources , " said Mike Rogers , chairman of the NRCC 's incumbent retention program , to Roll Call .
 It s not right to ask the whole Conference to help those who arent willing to help themselves . 
Some state parties are already punishing members who have crossed the aisle in recent weeks .
On Sunday , the California Republican Party voted to withhold party funding in the 2010 election from the six GOP state legislators who voted in favor of Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger 's compromise budget last week .
The budget included the largest tax increase in the state 's history to balance a $ 42 billion shortfall .
" The measure was " approved swiftly and without debate Sunday as the party 's twice - annual convention wrapped up in Sacramento .
An earlier version of the measure contained stronger language , calling for a censure , " writes the Associated Press .
" Supporters said Sunday 's resolution sends a strong message to politicians that there will be consequences for breaking their no - tax pledge . "

There ’s really only one solution .
Only one way for Obama to get himself out of the box his predecessor Bush , Dick Cheney and the neocons have put him in .
He has to affirm Iran ’s inalienable right under the Non-Proliferation Treaty to enrich uranium .
Somewhere along the road American public opinion , which history shows can be easily persuaded of things that just are n’t true , has bought several highly questionable propositions :
1. Iran has a nuclear weapons program .
2. Iran ’s nuclear program can have only one purpose , the production of nuclear weapons .
3 . The Iranian leadership wishes to , and has threatened to , wipe Israel off the face of the map .
4. Given all of the above , Iran ’s progress towards nuclear enrichment must be stopped in order to prevent a second , “ nuclear ” Holocaust .
These propositions — Big
Lies that that become better established with each retelling — are in fact easily refutable .
1 . The U.S. intelligence community itself does n’t believe that Iran has an active nuclear weapons program .
In November 2007 all 16 U.S. intelligence agencies produced a National Intelligence Estimate that declared “ with high confidence ” that Iran had suspended any such program as of 2003 .
Dick Cheney ’s office tried to suppress that report and with George Bush told the chagrined Israeli government he would ignore it .
( Recall that Cheney and the neocons surrounding him insisted with equal vigor in opposition to IAEA evidence to the contrary that Iraq had an active nuclear program in 2001 that could produce a “ mushroom cloud over New York City ” ? )
We ’re not talking about some liberal blogs challenging the Bush - Cheney claims here .
We ’re talking about the Central Intelligence Agency , Army Military Intelligence , the Defense Intelligence Agency , the National Geospatial - Intelligence Agency , the National Reconnaissance Office , the National Security Agency , etc .
Highly trained , professional , critically - thinking researchers whose best judgment is : Iran does n’t have a nuclear weapons program .
Repeat ( because this is so important ) : U.S. intelligence does n’t believe Iran has a nuclear weapons program .
2. Cheney on many occasions insisted that Iran , with its vast petroleum wealth , could only have one reason to seek nuclear power .
But successive U.S. administrations from the 1960s urged Iran , when it was ruled by the Shah ( whom the CIA had placed in power ) , to develop a nuclear energy program .
U.S. corporations such as General Electric were deeply invested in that program .
3 . Iran has rarely attacked another country in the last thousand years , and never in modern times .
On the contrary it has been the victim of aggression , most notably in the Iran - Iraq War , when Saddam Hussein , attacked in 1980 .
The U.S. supported Iraq ; Donald Rumsfeld visited Saddam twice , offered aid including satellite intelligence crucial to the Iraqi war effort .
The idea that Iran aspires to initiate war with a country a thousand miles away because of ingrained anti-Semitism among the leadership is very questionable .
Iran has the largest Jewish population in the Middle East outside of Israel , with representation in the Parliament ( Majlis ) .
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has not called for Israel to be “ wiped of the map ” but once quoted Ayatollah Khomeini ( who died in 1989 ) as stating that “ this regime occupying Jerusalem must [ vanish from ] from the page of time . ”
As Professor Juan Cole explains , “ Ahmadinejad was not making a threat , he was quoting a saying of Khomeini and urging that pro-Palestinian activists in Iran not give up hope — that the occupation of Jerusalem was no more a continued inevitability than had been the hegemony of the Shah ’s government . ”
The claim that Iran has “ repeatedly stated its intention to destroy the state of Israel ” is pure alarmist propaganda peddled by those calling openly for the bombing of Iran !
4. Iran ’s advancement towards nuclear enrichment is a progress towards something realized not only by countries with nuclear weapons ( including , one must emphasize , Israel , which unlike Iran never signed the Non- Proliferation Treaty ) but by Brazil , Argentina , South Africa , Australia , Japan , Germany , and the Netherlands .
Again : nuclear enrichment is not a crime but an inalienable right under the Non-Proliferation Treaty whereby nations agree not to produce nuclear weapons in exchange for assistance in developing peaceful nuclear programs under carefully monitored conditions .
The rules allow them control over the entire “ nuclear fuel cycle ” under IAEA inspections .
The idea that Iran is a special exception to the rules is an obvious conceit of the Bush - Cheney era propaganda .
The idea that if normal rules apply , and Iran proceeds as usual and gets its nuclear reactors online , nukes will forthwith rain down on Israel ( with its 200 warheads ) and produce a second Holocaust ( frying Israeli Jews and Palestinian alike ) is wild , paranoid fantasy .
So let Obama say , unequivocally :
We recognize and respect Iran ’s right to have a peaceful nuclear program monitored by the IAEA , to enrich uranium , to master the nuclear cycle — just like any other normal nation .
Should he not do so , the burden is on him to explain why , as the candidate of “ change ” and “ hope , ” who on Inauguration Day told the Muslim world he would seek “ a new way forward , based on mutual interest and mutual respect ” he continues the Bush - Cheney policy of vilification , insinuation , and Zionist pandering in connection with this issue .
Court allows retention of call and e-mail data Ireland had argued that national governments rather than the European Commission should have decided on law .
The European Union ’s highest court has upheld a law that forces telecoms companies to retain information on phone calls and e-mails , ruling that the European Commission was correct to ground the law on a desire to regulate the internal market .
The European Court of Justice ( ECJ ) said the data - retention directive , adopted in 2006 to help police investigate terrorists and serious cross - border crimes , ensures that the obligations and costs imposed on telecoms companies are the same throughout the EU , thereby allowing for the “ functioning of the internal market ” .
The Irish government , which had brought the challenge , argued in court that the purpose of collecting the data was criminal investigation and that a different legal basis should therefore have been used , with the proposal agreed between national governments .
If a law is based on an internal market basis , it has to be proposed by the Commission and approved by both the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament .
The Irish government also pointed out that in 2006 the ECJ had struck down an agreement between the EU and the US on the exchange of information on airline passengers because the wrong legal basis had been used – the legal basis regulating the internal market was used , rather than one concerning criminal investigation .
But the Court rejected this argument , saying that unlike the decision on passenger name records , which concerned the transfer of personal data “ within a framework instituted by the public authorities in order to ensure public security ” , the law on retaining data covered the activities of service providers in the internal market and did not contain “ any rules governing the activities of public authorities for law - enforcement purposes ” .
The ECJ added that the original EU legislation on data protection from 1995 was introduced under a legal basis regulating the internal market .
The directive was aimed at telecoms operators alone and did not regulate the activities of police officers , it said .
The case will have little practical effect on the data - retention directive since it has been implemented by all 27 member states .
Ireland was ordered to pay costs .
UYUNI , Bolivia 
In the rush to build the next generation of hybrid or electric cars , a sobering fact confronts both automakers and governments seeking to lower their reliance on foreign oil : almost half of the world ’s lithium , the mineral needed to power the vehicles , is found here in Bolivia  a country that may not be willing to surrender it so easily .
Japanese and European companies are busily trying to strike deals to tap the resource , but a nationalist sentiment about the lithium is building quickly in the government of President Evo Morales , an ardent critic of the United States who has already nationalized Bolivia ’s oil and natural gas industries .
For now , the government talks of closely controlling the lithium and keeping foreigners at bay .
Adding to the pressure , indigenous groups here in the remote salt desert where the mineral lies are pushing for a share in the eventual bounty .
“ We know that Bolivia can become the Saudi Arabia of lithium , ” said Francisco Quisbert , 64 , the leader of Frutcas , a group of salt gatherers and quinoa farmers on the edge of Salar de Uyuni , the world ’s largest salt flat .
“ We are poor , but we are not stupid peasants .
The lithium may be Bolivia ’s , but it is also our property . ”
Uwe Reinhardt :
Can Economists Be Trusted ? , by Uwe E. Reinhardt , Economix : ... [ W] ittingly or unwittingly , economists infuse their analysis with their own ( or a political client ’s ) preferred ideology .
Consider , for example , President Bill Clinton ’s 1993 - 94 health - reform plan .
In this plan , President Clinton proposed a mandate on employers to provide their employees with health insurance .
Politically conservative economists predicted that the mandate ... would lead to vast unemployment .
Economists supporting the Clinton health plan predicted that the ... mandate ... might even ... increase employment .
It can be shown with a simple mathematical model that an economist ’s prediction in this regard is powerfully driven by two assumptions about the behavioral responses to mandated employer - paid health insurance .
...
Unfortunately , the empirical literature on this responsiveness offers economists a wide range of estimates from which they can choose ...
This example starkly illustrates how easy it is for economists to infuse their own ideology – or that of their clients – into what may appear to outsiders as objective , scientific analysis .
We are now seeing a replay of this tendency in the debate on the relative merits of added government spending versus added tax cuts as measures to stimulate the economy .
Writing in The New York Times , for example , the Harvard professor N. Gregory Mankiw , former chief of President George W. Bush ’s Council of Economic Advisers , makes a case for stimulating the economy through tax cuts rather than added government spending .
...
To buttress his case ... , he then cites an empirical study by Valerie A. Ramey , according to which the $ 1 of added government spending will ultimately increase gross domestic product ( G.D.P. ) by only $ 1.40 , while according to another recent study by Christina and David Romer , $ 1 of tax cuts over time increases G.D.P. by $ 3 .
Non-economists may ask , of course , exactly how a $ 1 cut in taxes would translate itself into a $ 3 increase in G.D.P. at a time when traumatized households , whose wealth has been eroded , might use any new tax savings merely to pay down debt or rebuild their wealth through added savings , rather than spend it , and when business firms unable to sell their output even from existing capacity might hesitate to invest such tax savings in more capacity .
But never mind this fine point .
More interesting is the fact that Christina Romer is to be the head of President - elect Barack Obama ’s Council of Economic Advisers .
In that capacity , last Saturday she released an analysis of fiscal stimulus alternatives , with a co-author , Jared Bernstein .
Curiously — or perhaps not — for that analysis , the two authors assume a much larger four - year multiplier effect for added government spending ( 1.55 ) than for tax cuts ( 0.98 ) , although they do confess to a high degree of uncertainty on the actual sizes of these multipliers .
So there you have the flexibility , shall we say , that economists enjoy when they apply their professional skills to affairs of state in what may seem , to outsiders , like purely scientific analyses .
In the first lecture of my freshman economics course at Princeton entitled “ The Art of Siffing Among Seasoned Adults , ” I demonstrate how seasoned adults routinely structure information felicitously ( i.e. , “ sif ” ) to further their own agenda , and I point out that economists can be among the most skillful practitioners of this art .
...
When economists advise on public policy , the operative mantra is Caveat Emptor ! ” ...
The answer to this , of course , is that economists should acknowledge the range of estimates , and , if they are committed to one set of estimates over another , if they want to get past the " on the one hand , on the other hand " construction , why they think one set is better or worse than another ( let me admit to being less than perfect at this myself ) .
Brad DeLong :
Fama 's Fallacy V : Are There Ever Any Wrong Answers in Economics ? : Montagu Norman here , back from my grave once again .
This time it is Greg Mankiw whose words have summoned me ...
One thing that used to give me nightmares -- and that provoked several of my nervous breakdowns - - was how you could never get any economist ( except for John Maynard Keynes ) to take a definite position .
They were always " on the one hand - - on the other hand . "
This was what led Harry Truman in later days to wish for a one - handed economist , a wish that has never been fulfilled ...
The " on the one hand - - on the other hand " nature of discourse raises the question of whether in economics -- a " science " where there is enormous intellectual and ideological and political disagreement about how the world works -- there can ever be any wrong answers ?.
I believe that there can be wrong answers in economics , because examinations in economics tend to take a particular form : instead of asking ( i ) " do expansionary fiscal policies increase output and employment ? " we ask ( ii ) " in models where there are idle resources and high unemployment , do expansionary fiscal policies increase output and employment ? " ( ii ) is a question about a particular class of models of the economy , and so has a definite right answer - -" yes , in that class of models they do " -- and a definite wrong answer - -" no , in that class of models they do n't . "
Eugene Fama claimed that " when there are idle resources -- unemployment " expansionary fiscal policies had no effect in models in which the NIPA savings - investment identity : investment = ( private savings ) - ( government deficit ) held .
Now the NIPA savings - investment identity holds in all models -- it is , after all , an identity , true by definition and construction .
And every single model that has been built in which there is a possibility of high unemployment and idle resources is a model in which fiscal policy works because increases in government spending lead to unexpected declines in inventories and unexpected declines in inventories lead to firms to expand production , which leads to increases in income and saving .
I would , therefore , say that Fama 's claim is " wrong " .
Not only does it not hold in all models in the class , it does not hold in any models in the class .
Greg Mankiw disagrees : Greg Mankiw's Blog : Fama 's arguments make sense in the context of the classical model ... presented in Chapter 3 of my intermediate macro textbook .... I would go on to the Keynesian model ....
But whether one leaves the classical model behind to embrace the Keynesian model is a judgment call ...
Mankiw thinks that Fama is not wrong but is , rather , making a " judgment call . "
But Mankiw writes in his chapter 3 that the classical model " assume [s ] that the labor force is fully employed . "
And so Greg gets himself into Cretan Liars ' Paradox territory here : Fama says that there is high unemployment and idle resources , while Mankiw says that Fama is not wrong because he makes sense as long as the labor force is fully employed and there are no idle resources .
Is Mankiw 's answer here a " wrong " answer , or is he too making a " judgment call " ?
I seek an empirical test .
I seek a Harvard undergraduate to take Greg Mankiw 's course this spring , to write the following in an appropriate place : the classical model of chapter 3 shows us that expansionary fiscal policies have no effect on output even where there are idle resources -- unemployment .
and to report back on the reaction of the course instructors .
Let 's ask another question .
Does Greg Mankiw believe in the classical model he is using to defend Fama ( in the classical model , the LM curve is vertical , and a vertical LM curve leads to a vertical supply curve , and to the result that demand side policies such as a change in government spending or taxes cannot change real output ) ?:
I disagree ... that the LM curve is vertical ...
Introspection is not a particularly reliable way to measure elasticities .
There is a substantial empirical literature on money demand that demonstrates that it is interest - elastic .
...
According to Ball , the interest semi-elasticity of money demand is - 0.05 :
This means that an increase in the interest rate of one percentage point , or 100 basis points , reduces the quantity of money demanded by 5 percent .
How far off is the vertical LM case as a practical matter ?
One way to answer this question is to look at the fiscal - policy multiplier .
In chapter 11 of my intermediate macro text , I give the government - purchases multiplier from one mainstream econometric model .
If the nominal interest rate is held constant , the multiplier is 1.93 .
If the money supply is held constant , the multiplier is 0.60 .
If the LM curve were completely vertical , the second number would be zero .
...
Greg has been pretty good at saying there is a lot of uncertainty about the fiscal policy multipliers , and about explaining why estimates differ across studies , and why he favors one set of estimates over another , so I do n't want to come down too hard on his disagreement with the 1.93 figure in his " favorite textbook " , but it does seem like he is defending Fama with a model that he does not believe in .
Thousands demonstrate in German city of Duisburg against Gaza onslaught
By our reporters
21 January 2009
About 2,000 people demonstrated in the German city of Duisburg last Saturday against Israeli aggression and its war in the Gaza Strip .
The demonstration was called by the Muslim group Organization for Human Dignity and Rights ( HDR ) .
The demonstration in Duisburg
Participants in the demonstration expressed their anger and indignation over the massacre of Palestinians in Gaza , but also protested against the stance taken by European governments .
One banner read : " Why is Israel able to do anything it likes ? "
Another banner read : " Today the European Union shows its true face . "
The demonstration was accompanied by a huge contingent of police .
Squads were deployed at the front , alongside and behind the demonstrators , even though the march route had been cleared ahead of time .
The reason for this enormous police presence was a minor incident that occurred at the major protest in Duisburg a week earlier .
On the preceding Saturday 10,000 people demonstrated in Duisburg against the Gaza war and Israeli policy .
The protest march and subsequent rally were largely peaceful , with relatively low numbers of police in attendance .
However , as the demonstration made its way through the city centre the anger of participants was provoked by the presence of two large Israeli flags hanging from a house along the route .
Some demonstrators threw snowballs at the flags .
In order to de-escalate the situation , one policeman intervened to remove the two flags .
Since the apartment was empty , the policeman broke down the door .
It emerged later that the apartment belonged to a student who admitted he stood on the street to observe the reaction to the Israeli flags .
This incident was then blown up in the course of last week into a quasi- hysterical campaign .
The Social Democratic Party ( SPD ) in the state of North Rhine - Westphalia demanded a state parliamentary debate and the dismissal of the local police chief .
The Central Council of Jews also criticized the action of the police .
The Duisburg police chief was forced to publicly apologize , and the two police officers who removed the flags are threatened with disciplinary action .
Feeling strengthened by this campaign , pro-Israeli forces , which had originally planned a rally in Essen , moved their demonstration to Duisburg .
The rally was called by a group set up a few days before calling itself " Students in solidarity with Israel in the Ruhr district . "
The group is part of a right - wing political organization and included the student who hung the two flags from his window .
It 's characterised by a fanatical defence of Zionism .
Some of them also defend the US war in Iraq , on the basis that it toppled a regime that threatened Israel .
Supporters of this group openly function as troublemakers , particularly against Muslims and their organizations .
Their own " demonstration " in Duisburg consisted of around 30 to 40 supporters of the group , who gathered in the city centre waving Israeli and US flags .
Later some proceeded to the anti-war demonstration in the neighbouring suburb to provoke the participants by waving their flags and loudly chanting " Israel , Israel . "
Anticipating further provocations , the organizers of the HRD demonstration ended their protest prematurely , to avoid any escalation of the situation .
Reporters of the WSWS spoke with participants at the demonstration .
Zeyneb , Pinar and Sevenc
Zeyneb from Duisburg came to the demonstration with two friends , Pinar and Sevinc .
She said : " I find it totally inhuman , what is happening in the Gaza Strip — innocent women , children and others are bombarded and murdered .
The Israeli army intentionally bombed a UN camp that provided urgently needed food and assistance to the population .
Afterward the army leadership apologized .
But nobody believes them .
What is happening there is inhuman !
" The worst thing is those who are attacked there cannot defend themselves .
They have only stones , while the Israeli army , armed with the most modern weapons , proceeds against innocent people .
Even hospitals for newborn children and homes for orphans have been attacked .
How can one bombard a children 's hospital ?
It is beyond belief !
" In view of this situation and the suffering of the Palestinian population one has to do something .
Therefore we are here to demonstrate . "
Zeyneb also criticized the German media and politicians : " There are many reports in the media which are not correct at all , or they ignore the crimes being committed in Gaza . "
Melek Can Boutchich , a pharmacist in Duisburg , said she had responded to the call for the demonstration because she was opposed to Israeli policy .
" People there [ in the Gaza Strip ] have neither food nor medical supplies .
Even injured women and children have no chance of getting out of the theatre of war .
The world cannot close its eyes to what is going on .
We all have to defend and demonstrate for our rights . "
She also disagreed with the attitude of the German government to the Gaza war , and in particular with regard to German history and the Holocaust .
" Of course one cannot forget what took place at that time under National Socialism , but precisely for that reason Germany should react democratically and oppose the war . "
She had the feeling that many in Germany fear making public their opposition to the war because they would be subject to immediate criticism from the Israeli side .
Melek was also angry with the German Foreign Minister Frank - Walter Steinmeier ( SPD ) .
" The foreign minister flies to Egypt , and one thinks he is seeking to achieve peace , and then he proposes that Germany guard the border between Gaza and Egypt in order to stop the smuggling of arms .
One is left speechless .
I am really angry .
" There is barely anything about the war in the main newscasts , " she continued .
" My husband is an Arab , and we watch the Al - Jazeera television station .
There we see what is really taking place in Gaza ....
You see mutilated people in hospitals .
And they have to be evacuated from these hospitals because bombs are still falling there . "
She declared her opposition to looking at things too simply .
" I have seen that many people in Israel are also against the war .
People in Egypt are against the closure of the border to the Gaza Strip .
But the governments always have a different standpoint than the populations . "
She sharply criticised the double standards of Western governments .
" The US backs the war , " she declared .
" In Iraq they alleged there were missiles , and the US invaded immediately .
It had nothing to do with Saddam Hussein .
But now the US is just looking the other way . "
She assumed that an armistice was now being prepared to coincide with the inauguration of the new US President Barack Obama so he could pose as a peace bringer .
" But the war has cost the lives of thousands in Gaza .
In fact , I think they will find many more dead when they clear the rubble .
How can they count the dead under the destroyed houses ?
In addition , people there have more pressing needs at the moment than to count their dead . "
Melek explained that in this conflict it was not a question of nationality .
" I would also stand here on behalf of other people in this world who have been injured and damaged by war .
I am standing here on behalf of the children , the women , the innocent people in Palestine , who must endure the war , and to ensure that we do not all look away . "
Global losses from illegal and unreported fishing are estimated at $ 10 - 23.5 billion per year , according to a new study published in PLoS One .
Analyzing fishing data from 54 countries , David J. Agnew of Imperial College London and colleagues estimate the “ Illegal , Unreported and Unregulated ” ( IUU ) fish catch at 11 to 26 million tons per each year .
The authors found a strong link between governance and illegal fishing — illicit practices were most widespread in developing countries with poor monitoring and law enforcement .
Estimated catches in West Africa were 40 percent higher than reported catches .
“ This is the first time , to our knowledge , that a significant relationship has been demonstrated on a global scale between the level of illegal and unreported fishing and indices of governance , and it points to the benefits of improving governance , ” the authors write .
“ This is not to say that developing countries with poor governance records are necessarily to blame for illegal fishing , but that they are more vulnerable to illegal activities , conducted by both their own fishers and vessels from distant water fishing nations . ”

“ In Africa , for instance , many coastal states license vessels from distant water fishing nations such as China , Taiwan , Korea , the EU and Russia to fish in their waters , and there is a significant illegal fishing problem from many of these vessels . ”
The authors note that illegal fishing is an important driver of overfishing , which depletes the marine resource base and has ecological impacts .
“ Illegal and unreported fishing can have very significant effects on stocks .
For instance , unreported catches of bluefin tuna from the Mediterranean … have significantly contributed to the rapid decline in the stock , and a failure by the European Union to control unreported catches led to a failure to generate any recovery in North Sea cod until very recently , ” they write .
“ There is a correspondence between our regional estimates of illegal and unreported fishing and the number of depleted stocks in those regions .
For instance out of 53 demersal stocks recognized in the eastern central Atlantic , 32 of which could be assessed , 60 % were overexploited in the early 2000s compared to 30 % of EU stocks and 15 % of New Zealand stocks .
Thus out of these three areas those with the highest and lowest proportion of depleted stocks also had the highest and lowest levels of illegal fishing . ”

“ Illegal fishing creates significant collateral damage to ecosystems .
Illegal fishing , by its very nature , does not respect national and international actions designed to reduce bycatch and mitigate the incidental mortality of marine animals such as sharks , turtles , birds and mammals . ”
The authors do find some evidence of progress : 11 areas saw reductions in illegal fishing since the early 1990s .

Senator wants pay cap for Wall Street ' idiots ' Diane Sweet
Published : Saturday January 31 , 2009
Print This Email This An angry Senator Claire McCaskill , D - Missouri , introduced legislation on Friday that would cap compensation for employees of any company that receives federal bailout funds .
The bill introduced by McCaskill -- the Cap Executive Officer Pay Act of 2009 -- would limit employees to no more than the president of the United States earns annually , which is $ 400,000 .
" We have a bunch of idiots on Wall Street that are kicking sand in the face of the American taxpayer , " an enraged McCaskill said on the floor of the Senate .
" They do n't get it .
These people are idiots .
You ca n't use taxpayer money to pay out $ 18 billion in bonuses . "

States have been slashing funding allocations and contemplating tax increases as a means of balancing their budgets , which makes a recent revelation concerning the state of Utah 's treasury all the more embarassing .
According to investigators , state officials recently uncovered evidence that some $ 2.5 million had been transferred from the state 's coffers into various holding accounts .
The scheme is thought to have originated in Africa , possibly in Nigeria , but is not the same sort of attack that 's typically referenced when a person or article refers to a " Nigerian scam . "
According to the Salt Lake Tribune , the chain of events leading to the theft were set in motion when one of the would - be thieves ( or an associate ) acquired a vendor number for the University of Utah 's design and construction department .
That information allowed the miscreants to forge documents , changing the bank account information for the account in question .
Once the account was under new management , the criminals invoiced the state of Utah for various imaginary repairs and / or expenses with instructions to deposit the cash into the hacked account ( a Bank of America account in Texas ) .
The state paid out $ 2.5 million before the bank finally started making inquiries as to why the account was seeing such a large amount of traffic .
Of the $ 2.5 million transferred , the receiving bank was able to freeze about $ 1.8 million ; the net loss at this point is around $ 700 K .
There is no simple trail back to the perpetrators themselves ; the thieves obscured their own records by providing false identifications and addresses .
The Texas account at Bank of America was reportedly opened by a man with a Minnesota license , and other individuals mentioned in the warrant are also from that state .
The involvement and guilt , if any , of these individuals has yet to be determined , and it may be that the individuals in question were hooked through what would have appeared to be a standard " 419 scheme " on their end .
Existing security measures at both the University of Utah and within the Utah state government obviously failed , but identifying exactly where the failure points were seems more important than pointing fingers at this stage of the investigation .
Was the vendor number leak the result of spyware infestation , poor security , or a failure on the part of the university to recognize how vendor numbers could be used for illicit purposes ?
In this case , it 's particularly important to determine whether the thieves essentially got lucky by infecting a random system with unusually valuable information , or if someone involved in the theft was operating on insider information .
Given that Utah is one of many states facing a massive budget shortfall , losing money to scammers does n't look particularly competent , but once the particulars are known , the hole should be easy to plug .
I suspect this was a one - off operation rather than the sign of a new wave of attacks , as it employed a degree of sophistication we just do n't see in the bombardment of Nigerian scam e-mails that come pouring in , typed in capital letters .
That 's cold comfort for the state employees who are about to come under a bright light , but the other 49 probably hopefully do n't have a much to be concerned about .
Apple is developing a television set that will transform home entertainment by playing films or TV shows straight from the internet , according to a report that has created a buzz among the Californian company 's online fans .
A technology pundit with a US finance house said that the inventive firm would launch a stylish premium television with a Digital Video Recorder ( DVR ) , allowing people to record and download content without a DVD player or set - top box .
" We expect Apple to design a connected television over the next two years ( launching by 2011 ) with DVR functionality built in , " predicted Gene Munster , of American investment firm Piper Jaffray .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Moving into TV production would be a logical next step for Apple chief executive Steve Jobs , who has diversified the company away from its origins as a manufacturer of home computers in recent years .
Under his guidance , the once faltering company has become a powerful force in home entertainment through its gadgets and iTunes online shop , now the world ’s biggest seller of music online .
Apple recently signed a five - year $ 500 m deal for the production of computer monitors with the Korean electronic giants LG , which also makes televisions .
Mike Butcher , editor of UK TechCrunch website , said that an Apple TV set made perfect sense .
" I think it ’s very likely , " he said .
" It would have the iTunes site built into it so you could run or download movies and play your music or video collection . "
Apple already makes the £ 199 Apple TV , a box which transmits music , films and shows onto TV screens but a new television would stand out from the competition because it would not require any extra devices or attachments .
" With the use of a CableCARD for digital HD TV signal , Apple could effectively replace the home entertainment system ( including a music stereo , cable box , Blu-ray / DVD player , and gaming console ) with an all - in - one Apple television , " enthused Mr Munster .
He acknowledged television production was fiercely intensive but suggested Apple knew how to sell premium models in crowded markets , saying : " The argument that Apple will not enter the television market because prices have declined by 70 per cent in the past three years is a similar argument used to conclude Apple would not enter the cell phone market , given phones had seen similar price declines . "
Asked about the story yesterday , an Apple spokeswoman said : " We would never comment on rumour and speculation . "
Jobs usually announces new products at the Macworld conference in San Francisco in January , though he could not make the event last month due to a " hormone imbalance " which has caused weight loss .
Unofficial Apple websites were abuzz with comments welcoming or dismissing the TV speculation .
" Apple wo n't be making any sort of television this year or for the next 1,000,000 years , " wrote one commentator .
Another countered : " If Apple had not just signed a 5 year contract with LG , I would not believe this story …
Now with LG on board they gain instant access to the hardware . "
Tom Dunmore , editor in chief of Stuff magazine , described Apple ’s entry into TV production as possible but unlikely .
He said : " Possible in that they have got the technology to do it ; they produce large screen computers and monitors .
However the Apple TV has not been a massive success and it ’s still referred to as a hobby by the management which suggests to me that they would n’t be able to produce it in way that would be commercially viable . "
" But Apple do like to surprise us , " he added .
President Obama will offer a plan this week to cut the federal deficit in half by the end of his first term in office , largely by winding down the war in Iraq and raising taxes on people making more than $ 250,000 a year , an administration official said Saturday .
His federal budget blueprint also proposes to help reduce the deficit by eliminating waste and inefficiency in government , even as the administration launches ambitious and costly policy initiatives such as increasing access to healthcare and reducing greenhouse gas emissions .
Obama ’s first budget proposes cutting the $ 1.3 - trillion deficit he inherited when he took office to $ 533 billion by the end of his first term , bringing it to about 3 % of the economy , said the official , who asked not to be named because the budget has n’t been released .
As he begins to sell his plan for reaching that goal , the president will meet with a select group of lawmakers and experts Monday in a summit that the White House says will focus on bringing fiscal responsibility to the process of government .
Obama will speak directly to Congress on Tuesday about the state of the country , building toward a presentation of his budget blueprint on Thursday .

Obama ’s emphasis on fiscal responsibility is a key component of his attempt to sell the budget politically , a hedge against critics as the White House contemplates massive government bailouts of banks and automakers and moves to implement a rescue plan for homeowners .
Republican members of Congress have characterized Obama ’s stimulus plan as reckless spending , and the administration ’s intent to raise taxes on higher - income people in the next budget year is likely to draw an outcry .
Even as he talks about the need to stop the collapse of key economic sectors , Obama has repeatedly preached that the recipients of rescue money must act with restraint and responsibility .
On Saturday , the president insisted in his weekly radio and Web address that the government would get its own house in order too .
“ We ca n’t generate sustained growth without getting our deficits under control , ” Obama said .
Advertisement
His budget is “ sober in its assessments , honest in its accounting , and lays out in detail my strategy for investing in what we need , cutting what we do n’t , and restoring fiscal discipline , ” he said .
President Bush inherited a budget surplus from President Clinton , but the deficit soared during the Bush administration .
In the final months of Bush ’s presidency , the federal government ’s bailout of the financial markets pushed the deficit to more than $ 1 trillion .
Since Obama took office , Congress has signed off on a $ 787 - billion economic stimulus plan .
Yet as Obama tackles the problems that were awaiting him upon arrival in the Oval Office , he is also preparing to turn toward a list of domestic policy items he promised during the campaign .
With the unveiling of his budget , Obama will attempt to direct attention toward some of those initiatives , most notably his plan to overhaul the healthcare system .
Advertisement
The White House had been gearing up to make it the first policy initiative on its docket .
But plans were waylaid when former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle , Obama ’s choice to serve as point man on the project , withdrew from consideration for the job after it was discovered that he had n’t paid income taxes on a car and driver and other compensation he received after he left the Senate in 2005 .
The budget plan may cut spending on some health programs , potentially freeing up money to increase access to care .
Aides also say the president plans to begin addressing climate change and energy independence , two other resonant themes of his candidacy , with plans to limit the emission of greenhouse gases and reliance on foreign oil .
A key cost - saving measure of the president ’s plan -- withdrawal of combat troops from Iraq -- would also be the fulfillment of a campaign pledge .
Advertisement
The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have added an estimated $ 135.6 billion in costs above the Pentagon ’s $ 512 - billion budget during the present year , according to Pentagon figures .
Withdrawing troops from Iraq would result in a net savings , even though the president is sending more troops to Afghanistan .
Historically , the war in Iraq has cost more than the war in Afghanistan , and the presence of American forces in Iraq has been much larger .
Even after the U.S. doubles its presence in Afghanistan , it will still be less than half the size of the force now in Iraq .
The president has n’t outlined yet what kind of force , if any , he wants to keep in Iraq and what that might cost .
The budget plan may bring that into sharper relief .
Advertisement
The White House is also anticipating savings from the lapse of Bush ’s temporary tax cuts in 2011 , which apply to people who make more than $ 250,000 a year .
Obama called for the repeal of those tax cuts when he was running for office .
Also under consideration is the idea of taxing the investment income of hedge fund managers as income rather than as capital gains , potentially increasing the rate from about 15 % to about 35 % .
In addition , administration officials say the president will take steps to make government work more efficiently and eliminate programs that do n’t work , though another appointment misstep has slowed that initiative : Nancy Killefer , chosen to head up efforts to eliminate inefficient programs , withdrew from consideration because of personal tax issues .
There will also be an “ honest budgeting ” component to the budget address , critical of “ accounting sleight of hand ” that the administration source says has been part of the budget process in the past .
Advertisement
“ We should not tolerate these kinds of tricks when it comes to accounting for the public ’s tax dollars , ” White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said .
Though Obama ’s budget overview for the fiscal year beginning in October will come Thursday , the full spending plan is n’t due until April .
Still , the sales pitch began over the weekend , with Obama promising in his radio address to get “ exploding deficits under control . ”
Bringing down the deficit is important for the long - term health of the economy , he said : “ We ca n’t generate sustained growth without getting our deficits under control . ”

The Sea Shepherd ship Steve Irwin has collided with a harpoon boat in the Antarctic as the Japanese fleet shrugged off the hardline activists ' attempts to halt whaling .
Sea Shepherd leader Paul Watson said his vessel hit the Yushin Maru No.1 when it swept in front of him to clear the Steve Irwin away from the stern of the factory ship Nisshin Maru so it could take a whale aboard .
Captain Watson said he tried to back away but the movement of the whaling ships made a collision inevitable .
No one was hurt and the vessels were not seriously damaged .
He said the Steve Irwin recovered to be steaming on the stern of the Nisshin Maru and blocking further attempts at transfers .
So far today the whalers have managed to transfer four freshly harpooned minke whales to the Nisshin Maru , in the first successful whaling mounted by the fleet in the presence of Sea Shepherd .
ABOMEY , Benin , Jan 10 ( Reuters ) - Voodoo priests in Benin offered sacrifices and prayers to gods and ancestors on Saturday to seek an end to the Israeli - Palestinian conflict and to other wars in Africa and elsewhere in the world .
The small West African state sandwiched between Togo and Nigeria is the home of the ancient Voodoo religion , which was later carried by slaves to the Americas where it survives in different forms in countries like Brazil , Haiti and Cuba .
Addressing devotees at Abomey , 145 km ( 90 miles ) north of Cotonou , voodoo high priest Dah Aligbonon referred to the conflict in Gaza during ceremonies to celebrate Benin 's national voodoo day , a festival which draws hundreds of foreign visitors .
" All wars , which we deplore , have their origin for the most part in religious misunderstandings , " said Dah Aligbonon .
After sacrificing a cock , spilling its blood on the ground in honour of deities and ancestors , the high priest invoked their aid to end conflict in Gaza , in Somalia , in Democratic Republic of Congo and " everywhere where peace is under threat " .
" If there is no tolerance , religious hatred will spawn what is happening today in Palestine , where dozens of infants and innocents are paying for the intolerance of their parents , " he added , speaking after traditional chants and dancing .
He called for a dialogue between religions in the world .
The voodoo priests , through the casting of cowrie shells , also consulted an oracle , which made a prediction for the year .
The prediction urged Benin , and the wider world , to abandon hate , pride and jealousy and embrace unity , peace and tolerance .
In capitals across Africa , thousands of protesters have taken to the streets in recent days to demand an end to Israel 's 15 - day - old offensive in the Gaza Strip , during which 830 Palestinians and 13 Israelis are reported to have died .

1 Robert J. White , Brain Transplant Specialist
The Scientist :
Dr. Robert J. White is an American surgeon famed for his expertise in the field of transplantology .
His years of research into the human nervous system and the brain lead to the discovery of a spinal cord cooling process used by almost all medical institutions today .
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
He is retired now , but for over 40 years he was a neurological surgery professor for Case Western Reserve University medical school where ... oh who are we kidding , you do n't care about this , right ?
Let 's just get to ...
The Madness :
In 1962 , Dr. White was the first person to succeed in removing the brain of a dog and keeping it alive outside the body .
The canine gray blob was hooked up to a brain wave monitor which proved that , yes , it was still active and full of thoughts .
Whether the thoughts were centered around confused panic and pleas to kill it remain unverified though implied .
Then , in 1964 , Dr. White further succeeded in freaking out everyone around him by transplanting the brain of one dog into the neck of another .
Silly doctor , brains go in the skull , not the neck .
He must have been quite embarrassed when that was pointed out to him .

While the experiment proved that an alien brain can be kept alive in a host 's body , unfortunately it did not create a dog smart enough to write Internet comedy .
Our retirement plan .
Wait , it Gets Weirder :
In the 70s , after a series of experiments , White succeeded in transplanting the head of one monkey onto the body of another one .
Take a moment to let that sink in .
OK , the monkey only lived for a few days , but since then White has repeated his experiment , proving that his monkey heads could basically survive indefinitely with its new host body .
Too bad he had to euthanize them because they were all paralyzed .

Unfortunately , all of you who were just packing to stalk Vin Diesel 's apartment in hopes of wearing him like a new suit , please , put the syringes and saws down .
Modern medicine is still unable to repair nerve damage resulting from severing the spinal cord during the transplant , so all of the monkeys from the experiments ended up paralyzed from the neck down .
BUT , if you feel the life of a quadriplegic is a small price to pay to have girls all over your ( totally unresponsive ) Vin Diesel junk , Dr. White was kind enough to provide a step - by - step guide for you .

Colourfully decorated elephants are used during festivals in India
India has broken a three - decade - long tradition by banning the use of elephants at its yearly military parade in the capital , Delhi .
Authorities decided to do away with the tradition of parading colourfully decorated elephants following protests from animal rights activists .
There have also been security concerns after a near stampede by two elephants at last year 's parade .
Children feted for acts of bravery usually ride elephants at the parade .
Jeeps
Defence ministry spokesman D Mohanty told the BBC that " serious " security concerns had been raised after two elephants almost stampeded as they neared the dais where the president was sitting last year .
He added : " Besides , for four years now animal activists have demanded a ban on the use of elephants .
These two reasons forced the government to decide against their use from this year . "
Elephants for the parade were usually hired from private handlers for 2,000 rupees ( $ 40 ) by the defence ministry .
Authorities say the children at the parade will now been taken on open military jeeps .
Elephants are commonly used in India for transporting cargo and during religious festivals .
There have been a number of occasions , particularly in the southern state of Kerala , where elephants have stampeded at festivals , causing fatalities .

Although small and prosaic , this show is also richly resonant .
It presents 700 of Evans ’s postcards , arranged in gridded expanses according to subjects that are announced by Evans ’s original , hand - labeled dividers , which are also in the grids .
The subjects are wide ranging ; the colors are beautiful .
Evans had a special eye for images in which a pale - colored scene  a beach for example  is punctuated with bits of opaque black , usually figures or horses .
Image  Frame Houses in Virginia by Mr. Evans .

Through his postcard collection , Evans studied to be the artist he would become .
He trained himself to see in terms of photographic images , which helps explain how his own pictures became so lucid so quickly in the late - 1920s and early ’30s .
He was not above copying to learn .
His 1929 photograph “ Front Street , Looking North , Morgan City , La. ” almost perfectly matches the vantage point of a postcard displayed next to it that he owned .
The label equivocates about which came first , but the odds that Evans made the picture first and later found a nearly identical postcard seem too high .
The show opens with a bank of postcards that offer plunging views down the middle of scores of American Main Streets , an almost scary tribute to the country ’s can - do spirit , can - doing again and again .
A memorable Evans image that is not in this show may spring to mind : his 1931 photograph of the rain - slicked main street of Saratoga Springs , N.Y. , lined mostly with diagonally parked Ford Model A’s .
It is the Main Street postcards distilled , enlarged , crystallized in black and white , with undertones of grim complacency .
( Evans disdained color photography until late in life . )
The show includes a smattering of Evans ’s own photographs and the postcard prototypes that he made from them in 1935 and ’ 36 ; the occasion was a publishing project initiated by the Museum of Modern Art that never came to fruition .
Evans had no compunction about radical cropping .
It is startling to see good images become better as he reduces background space and brings central forms forward .
Cropping intensifies the geometry of everyday life to which Evans was instinctively drawn .
Image A detail from  Penny - Picture Display , Savannah .  Credit ... Metropolitan Museum of Art
For example the sudden prominence of the ferry on a postcard of Vicksburg , Miss. , makes the original photograph look slightly lackluster .
The same is true of “ View of Easton , Pennsylvania , ” even though its original is present here only in reproduction .
The closely clipped , game - board - like precision of flat yards , fences and small , boxy houses in the postcard version makes it all but perfect .
Also represented here are the original and truncated versions of Evans ’s images of frame houses in Virginia and a church in South Carolina , and his “ Penny - Picture Display , Savannah . ”
Its tiny , repeating photo portraits echo this show ’s dominant compositional motif .
The postcard ( listen up , appropriation buffs ) almost qualifies as a rephotograph of a rephotograph .
E. Peevie tells stories about life , love , loss and other topics that do n't begin with L .
Not long ago I was on a three - hour domestic flight and , as most people of my generation do , loaded up on reading material to pass the time and drown out the carnival barkers who double as Southwest Airlines attendants .
It struck me , mid-way through Tad Friend ’s engaging “ Letter From California ” in the Jan. 19 New Yorker — a very lengthy examination of current marketing techniques in Hollywood — that , but for the short confinement in the air , this is a story I ’d never have read otherwise .
No knock on Friend , but as opposed to just five years ago , my time spent with the print copy of The New Yorker is limited to “ The Talk of the Town ” and maybe a longer political or sports piece .
I tried to guess how many people actually got around to this writer ’s painstaking look at how movie executives think and make decisions ; probably few and far between , since the length discourages Internet users and , like most magazines , The New Yorker now tends to end up in a pile of unread titles of all but the most single - minded devotees .
Upon reflection , I wonder if The New Yorker , indisputably one of the elite magazines on the market , would be better served on the financial front if it were delivered to subscribers on Saturdays instead of Mondays .
( That ’s in Manhattan , of course ; those in the hinterlands receive their copies willy - nilly throughout the week . )
Time tried this gambit a year or so ago , releasing on Fridays instead of Mondays , but let ’s face it , the once - dominant newsweekly is almost completely irrelevant now — as is Newsweek — and , like its defunct sister publication Life , will probably cease to exist in print before the end of 2009 , no matter what spin is put out .
The New Yorker , on the other hand , remains a vital and utterly original magazine and might well benefit from this change of schedule , when its readers are relaxing on weekends and spend less time online .
One of the media - centric stories last month that caused a ridiculous amount of consternation among flat - earth journalists ( or “ print Creationists ” if you prefer ) was Michael Hirschorn ’s Atlantic essay “ End Times , ” in which he suggested that The New York Times might go out of business in May .
Hirschorn ’s been around the block , is well - liked and respected in the schmoozy media bubble , but this heresy was perceived as out of bounds .
It did n’t matter that he went on to say such an event was unlikely to take place so soon ; just the idea got him into professional hot water , drawing overheated scorn from Portfolio ’s Felix Salmon , The New Yorker ’s James Surowiecki and Columbia Journalism Review ’s Megan Garber , among others .
It was all a silly dust - up stirred up by professionals in the business who , not surprisingly , are in panic - mode .
However , by my reckoning , the most intriguing thought offered by Hirschorn was tossed off in a parenthetical remark , as he considered the bridge between print and online publication .
He wrote : “ Most likely , the interim step for the Times and other newspapers will be to move to digital - only distribution ( perhaps preserving the more profitable Sunday editions ) . ” [ Emphasis added . ]
Actually , Sunday - only print newspapers make a lot of sense for the same reasons I noted above about The New Yorker .
Consider , for example , a fourth - tier daily like The Baltimore Sun , a once - prestigious newspaper that ’s been kicked around in the past two decades — first by Times Mirror and then the Tribune Co. — so that it ’s now a joke in its own city .
Yet while the weekday editions of the Sun are tissue - thin , its Sunday paper is still fat with pre-print advertisements and loaded with editorial content .
The Sun ’s hourglass is grains away from being empty , given owner Sam Zell ’s difficulties and , unlike the Times , might actually shutter completely this summer , perhaps after a last - ditch experiment with free circulation or switching to a tabloid format .
The Times , however — as well as The Washington Post and maybe a handful of other dailies — is n’t in quite the same dire straits and could conceivably stave off financial ruin by going the Sunday - only route .
In effect , the Times would replace Time and Newsweek , larding its editorial pages with more and longer op - eds ; adding in - depth sports articles , as well as keeping the inexplicably popular ( at least to me ) magazine , arts section , and the advertising - friendly style and shopping fluff .
The paper ’s Book Review is , by this point , largely ignored by all but a devoted coterie of cultists , but what the hell , management could keep that too as a sop to older readers .
Oh , and yes , the first section would be reserved for what ’s considered “ news ” by the editors , although those articles , too , would need more substance and a longer shelf life than what currently appears on the front page .
This plan is more than a band - aid and less than a permanent lifeline , for the inevitable death of all print , except in a reduced , niche - driven category , is upon us .
Still , it would provide time , maybe a year or more , for the surviving dailies to figure out transformation plans , a project that , given the hubris of big media companies , was neglected 10 years ago .
As you can see in this television spot from 2003 , the Times sloughed off the Internet , letting a teenager speak about the paper ’s coverage of the web .
The Times , if it went Sunday - only , might also forestall a hostile takeover by some canny entrepreneur who ’d make a stock - price offer to shareholders that even the close - knit Sulzberger family , in control of the Times since 1896 , would eventually accept .
Carlos Slim Helu , the extraordinarily wealthy Mexican who ’s now made two substantial investments in the Times Co. , is seen by some as a relatively benign investor who ’s simply adding to his share total because he believes the Times is a still a valuable property .
Think again : Slim , unlike Zell , is no vanity white knight .
He ’s a telecommunications mogul in Mexico and much of Latin America and his interest in the Times is almost certainly not altruistic .
He ’s content to bide his time , and at the appropriate moment , swoop in , take over from the Sulzbergers , sell off its scrap parts and radically change the company to his own ends .
Sunday - only publication is , admittedly , a temporary fix , but for those who have n’t yet dressed for print media ’s funeral it ’s at least a respite .
I had an interesting discussion with a friend recently about how even people with great interpersonal skills may struggle with speaking in public .
As someone who was once relatively shy , and now speaks on panels and to large groups , I felt it would be useful to share some of the strategies I personally used .
Step 1 : Improve Speaking and Pronunciation
Before I dealt with issue of speaking in public , I first wanted to be a good speaker .
There ’s an unfortunate catch - 22 with public speaking : good speakers have confidence , but they have confidence because they are skilled at public speaking .
To raise my own abilities , and confidence in those abilities , before I ever spoke in public I first practiced just speaking .
Read out loud .
I had a number of choose - your - own - adventure novels I enjoyed when I was young .
In addition to being entertaining , reading them out loud allowed me to practice speaking with a broad , exciting vocabulary .
Choose your own adventure books also lend themselves well to dramatic interpretation , which allowed me to play around with inflection and tone .
My brother and I would sometimes take turns with them , reading a page and then debating which was the best approach .
If I had to pick reading material to start with now , I would probably use op - ed pieces in newspapers .

Emulate other speakers .
As a child I watched Wheel of Fortune with my family .
Pat Sajak had a calm , clear speaking voice .
When I started looking to improve my speech , I would watch and quietly repeat what he said to myself , and later while reading out loud in my room , or even in conversations with friends , I would ask myself “ How would Pat Sajak say this ? ”
Pat Sajak was the ultimate host – he made people feel at ease , projected confidence and charisma , and spoke clearly .
I noticed how he looked people in the eyes , his body language and the way he was expressive with his hands and body – but not too expressive .
Eventually I stopped emulating him , as I grew into my own as a speaker .
Step 2 : Practice Speaking and Poise
Once I was comfortable with speaking out loud clearly , I needed to improve my timing , tone , inflection and presentation .
There were no shortcuts for me – just lots of practice and steady improvement .
Practice speaking to a mirror .
This has always been a little difficult for me .
The usefulness of this activity is hard to dispute though .
The feedback is clear and immediate , and as I started improving it boosted my confidence by seeing how easy it was for myself to present an argument or point of view – even if it was just to myself .

The usefulness of this activity is hard to dispute though .
The feedback is clear and immediate , and as I started improving it boosted my confidence by seeing how easy it was for myself to present an argument or point of view – even if it was just to myself .
Record yourself speaking .
Video works best , but even just hearing audio will point out flaws in your speaking .
You ’ll notice whether you speak too slow or fast , the inflections in your voice , the “ ums ” etc .
If you can stand it , it ’s great to have someone else review your recording and critique you as well .
In high school I picked up a cheap audio recorder and would record myself practicing class presentations .
I did this for timing , as well as to see how I sounded – did my presentation make sense , did I speak clearly , was I too slow or fast .
By the time I had to actually present in class , I had already heard the presentation a half dozen times – and breezed through it .
When I was attending USC for my master ’s , I had to collaborate with other students on group projects which often ended in a class presentation at the close of the semester .
Because we could not always meet in person to practice , we needed to find another way to review our speaking parts .
The easy solution was to upload videos to YouTube .
A couple of my classmates were foreign students who were still learning how to speak English .
Watching them on video allowed me to point out grammar errors , inflection , mispronunciation , etc .
After the course was over , one of them remarked to me that the group project recordings had done more to improve his speaking than the two years he had spent trying to immerse himself in America .
Step 3 : Practice Speaking With Friends and Family
No real secret here – once I started improving my speaking skills , I enjoyed conversation more and was more outspoken among friends .
If you lack interesting material to talk about , consider reading some of my favorite personal development books .
Some other stories and thoughts from this site that provide good conversation fodder include :
Step 4 : Practice Speaking to Others – For a Small Audience
Once I had confidence in my abilities speaking , there were still a couple hurdles to cross .
Among them – would I run out of things to say , and since speeches are a one way street , how would I know if my audience was interested ?
There are a few social situations that can help with this
Multiple person dinner / party conversations .
All human interaction is n’t just one on one – oftentimes we ’ll meet for dinner with multiple people , or perhaps I ’ll be in a circle of friends at a party .
In these cases , when I ’m talking and more than one person is listening , it ’s a bit like a radio show – myself and the person speaking are the radio hosts , and the other spectating conversationalists are our audience .
These situations ( unintentionally ) present fantastic opportunities to work on speaking skills in a ( generally ) warm environment

These situations ( unintentionally ) present fantastic opportunities to work on speaking skills in a ( generally ) warm environment Committee meetings and debate .
I was in a number of service clubs , social clubs , student government organizations etc as a child .
Even at work I continue to have small 3 - 6 person committee meetings .
Once again , this provides a small , reasonably receptive audience to speak to – and one or two people who would provide immediate feedback .
Step 5 : Practice in Small Venues
Once I was able to present my point of view in front of spectator audiences , it was time to speak to real audiences .
I started small , in welcoming environments
Toasts / Speeches at Social Events .
Nobody is going to boo you off stage if you choose to make a toast at a New Year ’s , etc .
Depending on your level of comfort , it can be simple ( “ Here ’s a toast to health and happines in the New Year ! ” ) , or perhaps a short speech if appropriate for the event .
Remember , it ’s just about practicing speaking .

Remember , it ’s just about practicing speaking .
Toastmasters .
I ’ve attended a few toastmaster ’s meetings .
Though I never stuck with it long enough I have no doubt regular attendance would boost anybody ’s speaking skills .
The meetings I attended were well organized and everyone had a chance to speak , if only for a few minutes .
Members also were able to present longer speeches ( 5 - 10 minutes ) that they had worked on and prepared on various topics for the group , who then critiqued them and provided feedback on the presentation , as well as how well the speaker presented .
Practice coupled with constructive criticism is a surefire recipe for public speaking success .
[ reddit-me ]
That ’s it !
Once I was able to speak comfortably at small venues , it was just a matter of increasing the size of my audience .
I typically do not speak to groups larger than 50 - 100 people in person , but I imagine past that point any issues that arise would be most likely related to intimidation and stage fright .
There ’s no cure for that except for preparation , practice and putting yourself out there .
I have glossed over stage fright above , because it ’s hard to address that directly – but after considering it , I think I have an explanation for how I overcame stage fright as well .
Bonus Tip : Non-Speech Performances to Increase Speaking Confidence
The above steps are the basic formula I followed to improve my public speaking skills , but I have one final tip which did n’t fit in the above categories , but that definitely helped me overcome stage fright .
The secret ?
Performing in domains where I already had expertise , just to get me comfortable in front of an audience .
Spectator Sports .
Throughout school I played various sports – swimming , soccer , baseball , basketball , table tennis , tennis , badminton .
I was not a particularly good athlete , but my parents had to come cheer me on anyway .
Being out on the field in front of people , win or lose , gave me the confidence to be out there .
I am sure it helped that my parents were supportive – so be sure to bring some cheerleaders along .

Karaoke , chorus , concerts and open mic nights .
I ’ve always enjoyed music – I played piano when I was younger and play guitar now .
I sang in chorus , played for hundreds of people at concerts and have performed at dozens of open mic nights by myself .
Any chance I get , I ’ll sing at karaoke as well .
Hamming it up for friends and strangers helped boost my confidence to once again deal with stage fright , which made facing crowds easier when I delivered seminars and speeches .

Plays and theater performances .
My good friend Ryan took a theater class his first year in college , and while he was hardly shy before that , taking the class definitely made him more outgoing .
Making a fool out of himself on stage , in front of 500 of his classmates , with no negative repercussions has helped him be effective in his role as a manager today .
A Final Point – Experience and Expertise
One point I have glossed over above is that it takes experience and expertise to speak effectively on a topic .
I can discuss with confidence various technology trends , blogging , web 2.0 , time management , efficiency , etc – but I have no skill in other areas .
The reason I can speak confidently about certain domains is because I have the years of experience , training and personal study to back them up .
Put me in a situation where I need to discuss something that I have no familiarity with , and without adequate preparation time I ’m sure to falter .
If you need to give a speech , do n’t be scared of pushing your limits , but at least be aware of your expertise – and spend an appropriate amount of time preparing .
What do you think ?
What other tips would you add ?

December 1 , 2008 -- Bella Caledonia --
One of Scotland ’s largest neighbours has just voted for independence .
I do n’t mean England , or Ireland , or Scandinavia , but a country which is bigger than all of these combined .
And I use the term “ neighbour ” loosely , because it is a good few hundred miles across the Atlantic from us , and very few readers will have ever been there .
Greenlanders voted by 3 - 1 for almost total independence in late November 2008 .
I say “ almost ” , because while they do n’t get control of defence or foreign policy , they get control of just about everything else .
32 areas of government will be handed over to them .
Every political party , but one , in Greenland backed the “ yes ” vote .
Who could n’t sympathise with this statement that senior politician Hans Jakob Helms made ?
“ Home rule was a compromise , it ’s a simple fact that home rule has reached its limit and there ’s a need for more room for self - government . ”
Applied to Scotland , it appears that even the majority of Unionists support this position .
The result makes Greenlandic independence pretty much inevitable .
Greenland ’s road to independence is a bizarre one .
A colony of Denmark for 300 years , its population is tiny – a mere 57,000 ( less than Guernsey ) , but if it gains full independence , it will be the 13th largest state in the world .
Eighty per cent of the place is covered in ice , and there is no road network to speak of .
People get around by boats or planes .
There are about a dozen settlements , mostly tiny , scattered around the island .
Traditionally , some of them have had almost nothing to do with one another , just because of the sheer distances involved .
It is the largest island in the world – if you do n’t count Australia – at eight times the size of Great Britain .
At one end , it is near the North Pole , and at the other , the same latitude as parts of Shetland – there are even some trees there .
Technically part of North America , its size and remoteness , makes it almost a continent in its own right .
Eighty per cent of the people who live in Greenland are Inuit , only 12 % are Danes .
Under the terms of the referendum , Greenlandic will replace Danish as the language of government .
The native Greenlanders are an obviously non-European people , still tribal to an extent , and mainly nomadic in the recent past .
The native Greenlanders have massive social problems including a degree of permanent unemployment , bad diet , alcoholism , drug abuse and even AIDS .
The suicide rate is also extremely high .
While the traditional Inuit lifestyle was a difficult and harsh one , the modern disillusionment and substance abuse are classic results of colonialism , and can be found in places such as widely separated as Peru and Tibet , as well as parts of Australia and the USA .
By voting “ yes ” , the Greenlanders have displayed the maturity and self - confidence that they require for a happier future .
Greenlandic is now the only official language – even though it has fewer speakers than Scottish Gaelic .
However , Greenland already has some serious problems which are global in nature .
One of these is climate change , something impossible to deal with at a purely local level .
Greenland features prominently in Al Gore ’s documentary , An Inconvenient Truth , with good reason .
If its ice cap melts , the sea level may rise by twenty five feet everywhere , drowning whole cities and nations .
Another theory claims that if it melts , then the Gulf Stream will be set into reverse , and Europe will experience another ice age .
Neither of these are theories that I ’d like to see proven .
Further oil drilling and mining will provide jobs and money for the Greenlandic economy , but they also threaten the hunting and fishing many Inuit still rely on , and poison the island ’s fragile environment permanently .
Greenland ’s economy is much less diversified than Scotland ’s , and subsidised to the tune of £ 400 million by Denmark , but the alternatives may prove simply too costly .
If it is not careful , Greenland also risks replacing Denmark with the USA .
The island played a surprisingly strategic role in both WW2 and the Cold War .
The Americans unsuccessfully tried to buy Greenland off the Danes for $ 100,000,000 .
In 1953 , the Danes allowed them to set up the Thule base in the far north of the island .
It was the most northerly US base anywhere , and allowed the US to monitor Soviet activity in the Arctic .
With shades of Britain ’s Diego Garcia – in 1999 , the Danish High Court ruled that the base was on Inuit land , and that the inhabitants had been illegally evicted .
Shortly after this ruling , it also emerged that a B52 had crashed near there in 1968 .
It had been carrying H - bombs , and an estimated 1700 people were exposed to radiation .
The base is still there .
Some people argue that an independent Greenland would be unable to defend itself , but its relationship with the USA is going to be one sided from the outset .
But what Greenland has done is brave , and we should respect them for it .
As one Welsh blog puts it :
Now , if Greenland , a nation of 57,000 people , speaking what many of our fellow - country men would probably call ‘ a silly language which nobody speaks ’ , has the confidence to have more power , what the hell is stopping Wales ?
When it comes to self - determination , the Nordic countries have a much better record than most .
I suspect there are several reasons for this , one of them being that it is much easier for the likes of Greenland to deal with a nation of several million , than one of tens or hundreds of millions .
Second , the remoteness of many parts of the Nordic countries meant that it was more practical for a number of decisions to be taken locally to begin with .
Denmark ’s other colonies , such as the now independent Norway and Iceland , or the nearly independent Faroe Islands , all neighbours of Scotland , have been given much fairer hearings by Copenhagen , than they would have done from London .
For example , since WWII , the population of the Faroe Islands has doubled , while that of the Shetland Islands has halved .
It ’s worth remembering that Greenland got its parliament in 1979 , the very year that Scotland ’s own vote for an assembly was sabotaged .
Since then , Greenland has never looked back .
Scotland , on the other hand , is only just getting over that defeat .
A short history of Greenland
The first people arrived in Greenland over 4000 years ago , although it has not been continuously inhabited since then .
It is thought that the ancestors of the Inuit arrived in about 1200 .
Southern Greenland ’s European connection goes as far back as 980 , when it was discovered and settled by the Norse .
Their numbers were never particularly great .
By the 15th century , Greenland ’s white population appears to have died out , due to worsening climate , unsuitable farming methods which eroded the thin soil , and conflict with Inuit who came in from the north .
They did not leave much of a legacy , other than a few ruins , and a mere 5 % of Greenlandic DNA .
The Europeans returned in the early 18th century with disastrous consequences .
The missionary Hans Egede heard stories in Norway of the Norse settlement in Greenland , and decided to find out whether it still existed .
He established Godthåb ( Nuuk ) , the capital , and set about converting the natives and wrote down their language for the first time .
He also translated the Bible – an incredible feat as Greenlandic lacked words for “ bread ” , “ sheep ” , “ wine ” and other important Christian imagery : his version of the Lord ’s Prayer includes the surreal line : “ Give us today our harbour seal . ”
Within a few years , a smallpox epidemic had wiped out large numbers of Inuit , and their shamans were being tried for witchcraft .
The Europeans ’ intensive hunting , fishing and whaling made it harder for the Inuit to obtain food , and some of them were also abducted or raped by sailors .
By the end of the 18th century , Greenland was an official Danish colony .
During the 19th century , the first newspaper in Greenlandic appeared , and the first district assemblies .
In 1911 , two regional assemblies were established , one for the north and one for the south .
It was not until 1951 that they were merged .
These assemblies were not a form of home rule – they were more like local councils , and all their business was conducted in Danish .
In the late 19th century , a Greenlander actually reached Scotland by kayak after being blown off course .
He died soon afterwards , but his boat can still be seen in a museum .
In the early 20th century , the USA and Canada claimed parts of Greenland .
In 1946 , the USA attempted to buy all of it from Denmark , but the Danes refused .
In the 1930s , Norway laid claim to a section of east Greenland , but the Permanent Court of International Justice ruled in Denmark ’s favour .
In 1951 , Denmark and the US signed a defence treaty , and the Thule base was established two years later .
By 1953 , Greenland was no longer officially a Danish colony , and was allowed to elect MPs to the Danish parliament .
Proper welfare and medical programs were initiated , and most of the population started to move into towns .
Greenland ’s integration with Denmark meant it became part of the EEC in 1973 , even though 70 % of Greenlanders voted against joining it in the referendum .
In 1978 , Greenlanders voted for devolution , and a year later , a 31 - seat parliament was set up .
All Danish place names were replaced by their Greenlandic versions .
In 1982 , 53 % of Greenlanders voted to leave the EEC , while Denmark itself stayed in .
This put Greenland in a strange political position , but not a unique one – the Isle of Man , Bermuda , the Faroe Islands , Canary Islands and Madeira are amongst those nations currently outside the EU , but still controlled by members of it .
In 1985 , Greenland ’s flag was designed , and in 1996 , the international Arctic Council , an environmental body , was established , with Greenland as a founder member .
In November , 2008 , three quarters of Greenlanders voted “ yes ” …

Allen Stanford forfeited $ 3 million in drug money back in 1999 , and it's a sure thing that within his multi-billion empire he had many more drug dollars under his care .
This is true not just of Stanford , but of the whole Caribbean offshore banking complex , as drug dealers are obviously interested in the regulation - light , few - questions - asked private banking system .
Offshore banks , meanwhile , have grown rapidly as major purchasers of US treasuries over the years .
As you can see in the chart below , they really spiked in the 04-05 range , right as Japanese holdings leveled off .
According this table , Caribbean banks are now the fourth biggest holders of treasuries , having surpassed Brazil and all the oil states combined in just the last year .
So again , how much drug money goes into financing our debt ?
And if you doubt the premise of our question , here 's famed rapper KRS - One making basically the same point
One of the many qualities of pinhole photography is its ability to capture time durations of beyond our vision .
Usually this is in the range of a few seconds , but by combining old and new technologies , it is possible to achieve exposures of far greater duration .
I have always been fascinated with astronomy , its immense scales of space and time reaching far beyond comprehension within our own short instances on Earth .
The project was to record views of Bristol , with the sun trailing across the sky from the winter solstice ( 22nd December ) to the summer solstice ( the 20th of June ) .
The technique is not new .
Several people are currently doing similar work .
Paolo Gioli in Italy did the first solargraph whereas Diego Lopez Calvin Diego Lopez Calvin instigated the new era along with Tarja Trygg in Finland .
I just wanted my hometown of Bristol to be imaged in this way .
Accessible wonder is all the reason I need .
If the members of group A and group B want to form a union AB it can be described by the following chemical equation .
$ $! \text {A} + \text {B} \rightarrow \text {AB} $ $
which will have a rate constant of
$ $! R = k[\text {
A} ] [ \text {B} ] $ $
Assuming this is an elementary process we can solve for the rate of this reaction by the introduction of a progress variable $ $ x $ $ .
$ $! x = ( [ \text { A} ] _0 – [ \text {
A} ] _t ) = ( [ \text { B} ] _0 – [ \text {
B} ] _t ) $ $
Substituting $ $ \ frac{dx}{dt} $ $ for $ $ R $ $ yields …
$ $! \ frac{dx}{dt} = k( [ \text {A} ] _0 – x ) ( [ \text {B} ] _0 – x ) $ $
And to determine the time behavior we simply integrate .
$ $! \int_{x ( 0 ) } ^{x ( t ) } \ frac{dx} { ( [ \text {
A} ] _0 – x ) ( [ \text {
B} ] _0 – x ) } = k\int_0^t dt $ $
Using the method of partial fractions
$ $! \int_0^x \ frac{dx} { ( [ \text {
A} ] _0 – [ \text {
B} ] _0 ) ( [ \text {
B} ] _0 – x ) } – \int_0^x \ frac{dx} { ( [ \text {
A} ] _0 – [ \text {
B} ] _0 ) ( [ \text {
A} ] _0 – x ) } = k\int_0^t dt $ $
Integrating …
$ $! -\ frac {1} { ( [ \text {A} ] _0 – [ \text {
B} ] _0 ) }\ln\left ( [ \text {B} ] _0 – x\right ) _0^x + \ frac{1} {( [ \text {A} ] _0 – [ \text {
B} ] _0 ) }\ln\left ( [ \text {A} ] _0 – x\right ) _0^x = kt $ $
Grouping …
$ $! \ frac {1} { ( [ \text {
A} ] _0 – [ \text {
B} ] _0 ) }\ln\left ( \frac{ ( [ \text {A} ] _0 – x ) }{( [ \text {
B} ] _0 – x ) }\right ) _0^x = kt $ $
Evaluating this from 0 to $ $ x $ $
$ $! \ frac {1} { ( [ \text {
A} ] _0 – [ \text {
B} ] _0 ) }\ln\left ( \frac{ ( [ \text {A} ] _0 – x ) }{( [ \text {
B} ] _0 – x ) }\right ) – \ frac { 1} { ( [ \text {
A} ] _0 – [ \text {
B} ] _0 ) }\ln\left ( \frac{ ( [ \text {A} ] _0 – 0 ) }{( [ \text {
B} ] _0 – 0 ) }\right ) = kt $ $
$ $! \ frac {1} { ( [ \text {
A} ] _0 – [ \text {
B} ] _0 ) }\ln \ left ( \frac{ ( [ \text {
A} ] _0 – x ) }{( [ \text {
B} ] _0 – x ) }\right ) – \ frac { 1} { ( [ \text {
A} ] _0 – [ \text {
B} ] _0 ) }\ln \ left ( \frac{ [ \text {
A} ] _0} {[ \text {B} ] _0}\right ) = kt $ $
Remembering that $ $ [ \text {
A} ] _0 – x = [ \text {
A} ] _t $ $
$ $! \ frac {1} { ( [ \text {
A} ] _0 – [ \text {
B} ] _0 ) }\ln \ left ( \frac{ [ \text {
A} ] _t} {[ \text {B} ] _t} \right ) – \ frac { 1} { ( [ \text {
A} ] _0 – [ \text {
B} ] _0 ) }\ln \ left ( \frac{ [ \text {
A} ] _0}{[ \text {B} ] _0}\right ) = kt $ $
Simplifying , we finally have an expression for the union of two reactive groups of people on Valentine ’s day .
$ $! \ frac {1} { ( [ \text {
A} ] _0 – [ \text {
B} ] _0 ) }\ln \ left ( \frac{ [ \text {
A} ] _t[\text {B} ] _0}{[ \text {B} ] _t[ \text {A} ] _0} \ right ) = kt $ $
May the rate constant ( $ $ k $ $ ) be large today !

The Ascent of Money - Niall Ferguson
The Ascent of Money Synopsis Bread , cash , dosh , dough , loot : Call it what you like , it matters .
To Christians , love of it is the root of all evil .
To generals , it ’s the sinews of war .
To revolutionaries , it ’s the chains of labour .
But in The Ascent of Money , Niall Ferguson shows that finance is in fact the foundation ...

Pain , resentment , guilt , anger , and fear … all of these feelings bubble up inside of us when we think back on our mistakes or the mistakes of those dear to us .
Sometimes the only healthy way to move forward is to look back at our past and inject forgiveness into our lives .
Some say “ forgive and forget . ”
Others say “ forgive , but never forget . ”
No matter which path you choose , the act of forgiving is the first step .
Here are three simple ways to bring more forgiveness into your life .
Forgive Yourself
In general , we tend to be harder on ourselves than we are on others .
If you ’ve made mistakes in the past , it ’s time to let your spirit heal by forgiving yourself .
We all do things we are n’t proud of .
Understand that you were doing the best you could at the time , with the experiences and knowledge you had accessible to you .
Self - forgiveness tips :
Pick an area of your life you would like to work on .
It could be failed relationships , family problems , or business mistakes .
Make a list of all of the people you might have hurt along the way .
This is the toughest part because we tend to bury some of these stressful memories .
So be honest with yourself and take your time .
After you ’ve compiled your list , systematically go through each person on the list .
Think about the situation , validate the circumstances , and forgive yourself for hurting them .
As odd as it may feel , apologize aloud to yourself , “ I forgive myself for hurting this person , ” and take a deep breath .
Once you ’ve completed this practice you ’ll instantly feel a slight sense of relief .
Remember , the simple act of acknowledging your mistakes is always half the battle .
Ask for Forgiveness
Once you forgive yourself , it ’s also important to clear the air with others .
A face to face apology is always the most effective approach .
Depending on the situation , you might be afraid to ask for forgiveness .
But if you do n’t ask , you will never feel the relief of being pardoned for your mistakes .
If you absolutely can’t bring yourself to ask for forgiveness in person , I still recommend writing a letter of forgiveness .
The reason writing a letter works so well is that the process of writing the letter actually assists you in forgiving yourself by reducing pent - up , internal feelings of guilt .
It lets you express your thoughts and process all of the internal drama that has bottled - up in your mind .
Tips for writing your letter of forgiveness :
Do n’t do it out of spite , or because you think it will elevate you to higher moral ground .
No good ever arises from deception .
Realize that a letter ca n’t undo the damage .
A letter of forgiveness might not be enough to change your relationship with the recipient , but it ’s a significant step in the right direction .
Explain your rationale , but do n’t make excuses for your behavior .
Own up to your actions and take responsibility .
Offer to fix the situation , or find a way to make it up to the person .
Make a sincere wish for the well - being of the person you hurt .
After many years of festering emotions , you may have come to hate the act of thinking about this person .
Stop being selfish !
It ’s time to be honest and compassionate .
Hopefully , just writing the letter will allow you to move closer to a positive resolution on all fronts .
Forgive Others
If you ’ve been hurt in the past , you do n’t need to keep suffering .
Whether or not you ’ve gotten closure is irrelevant .
You have the ultimate power to clear the air by simply forgiving those who have hurt you .
You should make a list of all of the people who have done something that still troubles you to this day .
The list might start out small , but as you unwind your memories you are bound to find more people and incidents than you were previously aware of .
Your mind represses these memories in an effort to preserve your conscious sanity .
The drawback is that you probably have n’t processed these events properly .
So while you are n’t actively thinking about them , they are quietly tugging at your consciousness and robbing you of mental energy .
Tips for forgiving others :
Close your eyes and picture the person standing in front of you .
In your mind ’s eye , explain to them how you felt then , how you feel now , and what happened during those hurtful times .
After you ’ve stated your views , let them acknowledge your pain .
Watch their reactions and wait for a response .
There ’s a good chance they will understand your point of view .
Then hug them and tell them that you forgive them .
Yes !
Really do this with all of your emotional might , it ’s a powerful process !
Release them from your troubled past and let your thoughts come back to the present .
After completing only a few of these processes , you ’ll find yourself breathing deeper and interacting differently with these people .
Regardless of whether or not they are still a part of your daily life , you will forever see them in a more positive light … which will ultimately make your future brighter .

An organized mind at work is a wonderful thing to watch .
During his address to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday night , President Barack Obama placed the mind of his presidency on display , and it was wonderfully organized .
The speech — a State of the Union stand - in — presented a clear , mostly left - of - center agenda for his presidency and a series of forceful rationales for his proposed actions .
Obama offered all this up with a now - familiar fair dose of charm and grace .
It ’s been years since any BMOC in Washington has presented such an extensive and well - articulated plan for — dare one say it — change .
This was a political speech , so it had the predictable elements : Americans do n’t give up , we ’ll pull together and rise again .
But the strategic thrust of the speech was deftly delivered : Obama declared that the crisis — make that , crises — of the moment offers opportunities for fundamental shifts in national policies related to the economy , energy , education , and health care .
In other words , the current calamity provides additional cause to proceed rapidly and ambitiously on these fronts .
At the start of the address , Obama said now was not the time to “ lay blame ” for the current predicament .
But he did , noting that for years Washington — a.k.a. the George W. Bush administration — did little to deal with fundamental economic flaws , the nation ’s oil dependency , and the country ’s troubled health care system .
“ We have lived through an era , ” Obama said , “ where too often , short - term gains were prized over long - term prosperity ; where we failed to look beyond the next payment , the next quarter , or the next election .
A surplus became an excuse to transfer wealth to the wealthy instead of an opportunity to invest in our future . ”
So now , he added , a “ day of reckoning has arrived . ”
Thus , a young black guy stood before Congress and in front of an older white guy ( Vice President Joe Biden ) and a woman ( House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ) to lay out a road map for saving America .
Much of the first half of Obama ’s speech was devoted to a forceful , yet not partisan , defense of his first steps in office .
He praised the passage of the stimulus bill .
And as he did so , a televised moment occurred that could well come to symbolize the two parties :
Democrats stood to cheer the $ 787 billion measure ; Republicans kept their backsides in their seats .
In the next election cycle — when the initial results of the stimulus legislation will be apparent — this image will likely be ammo for one of the two parties .
( And when Obama referred to a provision that will provide tax credits for college tuition , many in the chamber applauded ; Senator Mitch McConnell , the Republican leader , did not . )
Obama then hailed and explained his administration ’s preliminary endeavors to prevent the further collapse of the financial system and to address the mortgage implosion .
He acknowledged that doling out billions to bad bankers is a hard sell .
But , once again , he had a convenient foil : the Bush administration .
He declared ,
This time , [ the banks ] will have to clearly demonstrate how taxpayer dollars result in more lending for the American taxpayer .
This time , CEOs wo n’t be able to use taxpayer money to pad their paychecks or buy fancy drapes or disappear on a private jet .
Those days are over .
This not - too - subtle reference to Bush ’s botched bailout received a tremendous ovation .
And Obama , not shying away from bad news , noted that propping up Wall Street will probably require more than the $ 700 billion or so already set aside .
( He did not go into details about his various save - the - system plans . )
The first half of Obama ’s speech was about cleaning up the mess he had inherited .
The second half was about moving ahead with a largely liberal and daring policy agenda :
The only way this century will be another American century is if we confront at last the price of our dependence on oil and the high cost of health care ; the schools that are n’t preparing our children and the mountain of debt they stand to inherit .
And he made it seem so patriotic :
History reminds us that at every moment of economic upheaval and transformation , this nation has responded with bold action and big ideas .
In the midst of civil war , we laid railroad tracks from one coast to another that spurred commerce and industry .
From the turmoil of the Industrial Revolution came a system of public high schools that prepared our citizens for a new age .
In the wake of war and depression , the GI Bill sent a generation to college and created the largest middle - class in history .
Many State of the Union addresses end up grab - bag shopping - lists of initiatives .
Obama made his priorities obvious : energy , health care , and education .
He outlined his goals in each area clearly .
It was very seminar - like .
In the energy category , there was a call for energy efficient technology , solar , and hybrids .
He made a pitch to economic nationalism , noting that China , South Korea , Germany and Japan have passed the United States by in these areas .
He urged Congress to pass legislation to curb global warming pollution and boost renewable energy : “ We will invest fifteen billion dollars a year to develop technologies like wind power and solar power ; advanced biofuels , clean coal , and more fuel - efficient cars and trucks built right here in America . ” ( Clean coal ?
Perhaps he should check in with Al Gore . )
Regarding health care , he tied the lack of health care reform to the nation ’s dire economic situation .
It ’s a crafty move : attaching a big - ticket ( and complicated ) policy matter to the economic crisis .
“ Nearly a century after Teddy Roosevelt first called for reform , ” Obama said , “ the cost of our health care has weighed down our economy and the conscience of our nation long enough . ”
He did not describe a specific plan .
His message was big - concept : the economic downturn is more reason , not less , to get cracking on health care reform .
On education , he also shared no details , but he repeated his previous stance : the education system that fails too many children requires more money and more reform .
He did lay down a marker : “ By 2020 , America will once again have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world . ”
( One of the biggest applause he received the whole evening came when he called on parents to take responsibility for their kids ’ education . )
As for fiscal responsibility , Obama did what all presidents do : he promised to cut unnecessary government spending and to hold a “ conversation ” on Social Security .
But he also did what few have done : he presented a vigorous case for increasing taxes on the well - heeled .
He noted he will end the Bush tax breaks for the wealthiest 2 percent and reiterated what he said on the campaign trail : “ If your family earns less than $ 250,000 a year … you will not see your taxes increased a single dime .
I repeat : not one single dime . ”
He basically dared the Republicans to come after him as a tax - and - spend Democrat .
Obama deliberately concentrated on domestic issues .
But he quickly ran through his national security to - do list .
When he noted that he “ will soon announce a way forward in Iraq that leaves Iraq to its people and responsibly ends this war , ” he earned enthusiastic applause .
Even Senator John McCain stood up and clapped .
When he referred to his decision to shut down Gitmo , there were more applause .
And once the legislators were done cheering that , Obama declared , “ I can stand here tonight and say without exception or equivocate that the United States of America does not torture . ”
More applause — including from McCain and the Joint Chiefs of Staff .
Obama saved his political poetry for the end .
He talked about hope , about the need to transcend cynicism and doubt and to eschew “ the petty and the trivial . ”
He pointed out a Miami banker sitting in the First Lady ’s box who had given away his $ 60 million bonus to 471 people who worked for his bank .
He hailed Ty ’Sheoma Bethea , a young girl from South Carolina sitting next to Michelle Obama , who wrote a poignant letter to Congress asking for help for her dilapidated school .
“ We are not quitters , ” she had said in her letter .
Obama stole her line .
“ We are not quitters , ” he proclaimed .
We better not be .
Obama had laid out a stunningly grand game plan : fix the economy , solve the housing crisis , save Wall Street , transform America ’s energy system , revive its education system , renew and expand its health care system , and lessen the deficit — and , oh yes , while crushing al Qaeda and resolving wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
But he outlined all this with a can - do attitude that seemed more than canned optimism .
He was both serious and up - beat .
He recognized the daunting challenges and he hailed the possibilities for progress .
That is , he acted like a leader .
He acknowledged these are , in a way , the worse of times , but he contended they could — if the right decisions are made — lead to better times .
Let ’s turn lemons into an energy drink , he urged .
There ’s no telling if Obama can pull off any of this , or if he wins the legislation he seeks in these areas that these policies will produce a revived America .
But for anyone who wants to believe in him — and in troubling times , people tend to want to believe in their leaders —
Obama came across as confident and in command .
He provided reason to believe .
The State of the Union is not so strong at the moment , but the state of his presidency , at this early point , is .
AND THEN CAME JINDAL .
The same cannot be said for Republican Louisiana Bobby Jindal ’s presidential prospects .
He delivered the GOP response to Obama ’s speech , and he served up retro Republican nostrums .
An American of Indian ancestry , he started out with class by hailing Obama for having “ completed a redemptive journey that took our nation from Independence Hall to Gettysburg to the lunch counter and now , finally , the Oval Office . ”
Then he lit into Obama and his meta- approach : “ The strength of America is not found in our government .
It is found in the compassionate hearts and enterprising spirit of our citizens . ”
To illustrate this point , Jindal told an anecdote about an unnamed government bureaucrat who during Hurricane Katrina told a sheriff that the sheriff could n’t send out rescue boats without proof of insurance and registration .
Yes , the GOP ’s poster boy of the night was actually making the case that Katrina proved that citizens should trust Republicans more than Democrats .
Policy - wise , Jindal had little to say except cut taxes , cut taxes , cut taxes .
And during his brief response , he reminded the viewers eight times that Americans “ can do anything . ”
( He also tossed out false facts about Obama ’s stimulus bill . )
There are n’t many — if any — Capitol Hill Republicans whom the party would want to put on national display after an Obama speech .
Jindal was chosen because he ’s young , he ’s the child of immigrants , and he speaks to the party ’s base .
But he was far from dynamic , and he essentially just read the first ( and now tattered ) page of the GOP playbook : government sucks .
If Jindal , who passes for a rising Republican star , and the GOP want to tie themselves to this weak mast in the middle of the current storm , Democrats at this stage do n’t have much to worry about .
I have just submitted a draft article for inclusion in the Monad .
Reader entitled “ The Typeclassopedia ” .
I will let the abstract speak for itself :
The standard Haskell libraries feature a number of type classes with algebraic or categorical underpinnings .
Becoming a fluent Haskell hacker requires intimate familiarity with them all , yet acquiring this familiarity often involves combing through a mountain of tutorials , blog posts , mailing list archives , and IRC logs .
The goal of this article is to serve as a starting point for the student of Haskell wishing to gain a firm grasp of its standard type classes .
The essentials of each type class are introduced , with examples , commentary , and extensive references for further reading .
I would love feedback from anyone , from the newest newb to the expertest expert , who would be kind enough to take a look .
Particular types of feedback I would appreciate include :
Are there parts that are confusing or could be worded more clearly ?
Are there parts that are stated incorrectly ?
Do you know of any additional references that could be included ?
I am looking for more references for Foldable , Traversable , and Comonad in particular , so if you know of any good resources / examples / papers related to any of those , please let me know .
At 48 pages and 110 citations , the article is rather hefty , so I certainly do n’t expect most people to read through all of it anytime soon — but even if you only take a look at a section or two about which you are particularly interested and / or knowledgeable , your feedback would be greatly appreciated !
I hope that this can become a valuable reference for the Haskell community .
Edit , 16 March 2009 : a revised and updated version of the Typeclassopedia has now been published in the Monad .

Authorities in the field of software engineering have long lamented the fact that functional programming ( FP ) does n't seem to catch on .
Their sympathizers often blame that on shortcomings in the audience or their pointy - haired bosses , but that is the easy way out : to assume that someone that disagrees with you simply lacks the ability to understand you is a way of shielding yourself from the possiblity that you are the one with a shortcoming : the inability to provide a proper explanation .
I think that the actual reason for the limited adoption of FP languages is exactly that : the way the advantages are formulated and exemplified are completely obvious and compelling to their proponents , but those same explanations and examples utterly fail to convince most software engineers , because they simply do not appeal to the problemsare confronted with in their daily line of work .
I think this hypothesis is best exemplified by the seminal paper Why Functional Programming Matters .
This paper sets out toand then goes on with explanations likeand applications to things like the Newton - Raphson approximation and tree pruning in artifical intelligence .
[ I 'm inserting an intentional dramatic silence here , in which you can see my facial expression turn to complete astonishment ]
Now how in heavens name can one expect to convince the average software engineer of the tenets of functional programming with these kinds of examples ?
If it does one thing , it is scaring people away by seeming unnecessarily difficult and academic .
Every introduction to a programming language shows you the recursive method to calculate Fibonacci numbers .
It 's abstract , many people do not relate to it very well , but it 's only a single example .
However , the documentation for FP languages seem to consist solely of these kinds of highly mathematically inspired examples .
No ' Address ' class to be found there .
Has n't anyone written a functional equivalent of the Pet Store application to demonstrate the power of FP for the regular work that most of us do ?
People that want to improve the world often overlook one fundamental problem : you cannot improve the world just by being right .
You need to convince others of that fact if you want to exert influence .
If you cannot convince them , find out why you cannot convince them .
I think there is a bright future ahead for functional programming , as soon as someone stands up to convince the masses .
Update : As not everyone reads the comments , I would like to highlight a few points made there :
[..] demonstrate to the ' real world ' that functional programming is vitally important , [..] [ listing of advantages ]
Such a catalogue of ' advantages ' is all very well , but one must not be surprised if outsiders do n't take it too seriously . [..]
We must must find something to put in its place - something which not only explains the power of functional programming , but also gives a clear indication of what the functional programmer should strive towards .

Exactly why i dont get the fuzz about functional programming .
But it sounds like you know more about it than me , could you provide a simple useful , non-abstract example ?
I 'd really like to learn more about it but it's hard to catch on without any real - life ( well programming real life anyway ) situations
By Tubbie , Saturday 21 February 2009 23:39
The reason FP - proponents show mathematical examples is because that is what FP excels at .
The problem is that most code most programmers write every day is mostly about ' interacting with stuff ' ( Database , User Interface , etc... ) , and does n't really contain any complex math or algorithms .
FP languages are fundamentally different , and they are n't worth learning if it only solves some edge cases .
By Dooievriend , Sunday 22 February 2009 00:19
I agree with Tubbie , FP has other uses than ( Object Oriented ) imperative programming .
I 'm still studying to become an ICT - guy one day , and had a course on Prolog , Haskell and Mercury this semester .
I liked it a lot , and it is great for solving logical riddles like the Einstein - problem , sudoku's , hitori-puzzles or mathematical problems .
Still , after passing the course , I do n't have a clue how one would be able to build a gui with it , or how one can easily interact with a database .
To me , FP will be used , but only embedded in another language , when complex and often changing problems arise .
This is how I believe FP - languages should be utilized , and I know of at least one example where Mercury used in this way was the secret weapon which gave one company its edge over its direct competitors .
Though I do n't think the average programmer writing an average business application would need a FP language to excel at its job ...
By H!GHGuY , Sunday 22 February 2009 08:44 @ Dooievriend / Tubbie :
And that 's where mixed languages come into play .
Mixing imperative languages with functional languages to combine the best of both worlds .
By Confusion , Sunday 22 February 2009 10:55 @ Kage :
I intend to try and create those kinds of useful , non-abstract examples , but I 'm not sure whether I 'll succeed .
I certainly do n't think they will be simple .
One of the main points that the quoted article makes is that FP allows for new ways of modularizing your code .
To show the power of that , you need an example that requires modularization and that almost certainly means a large bit of code .
Another major argument in favor of FP is the way immutable data and side - effectless functions prevent bugs , but to demonstrate that , you need an example with an insidious bug , which is hardly ever simple .
Those same aspect mix very well with concurrent programming , but I think demonstrating the advantages in concurrent programming also requires a complex example .
@ Tubbie &Dooievriend :
I fully agree with H!GHGuY : mixed languages are the key to the adoption of FP languages .
I have developed and interest in Scala , which I think looks extremely promising .
By Jack , Sunday 22 February 2009 14:49
Although I agree that most introductions to functional languages ( and application as a whole ) are academic , this does not that there are n't any good examples out there on how they can be used .
E.g. : take a look at Practical Common Lisp http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/ .
I have to admit it is n't purely functional , though .
The above comments on mixed languages are probably right .
Heck , even C# supports lambda expressions nowadays !

@blog post :
" Every introduction to a programming language shows you the recursive method to calculate Fibonacci numbers .
It 's abstract , many people do not relate to it very well , but it 's only a single example . "
The Fibonacci example ( but also factorial ) is often used as a concrete example of the language 's syntax .
Since functional programming languages are centered around functions , what could be a better way to show how to define them ?
You could say Fibonacci and factorial are the Hello World of the functional world .
@Jack :
" Heck , even C# supports lambda expressions nowadays ! "
Not only that , it even has @Dooievriend : Real World Haskell is a book about the purely functional programming language Haskell and tackles problems such as parsing , web programming , databases , and GUIs.@blog post : " Every introduction to a programming language shows you the recursive method to calculate Fibonacci numbers .

By Morton , Sunday 22 February 2009 18:12
I agree with your central argument , but I see fewer such toy examples every year .
I think language designers and advocates are starting to realise the importance of useful , real - world examples .
Here 's hoping these kinds of examples continue fading into obscurity .
However , I have a tough time seeing where is FP * not* catching on .
I often find co-workers using functional patterns in their code without even realising it .
It is getting more difficult to find languages that do not have ( or plan to support ) advanced FP .
When Java and .NET decide to start supporting FP concepts , you 've got to wonder who thinks FP has n't caught on .
By dons , Sunday 22 February 2009 19:54
You 're attacking a strawman : Why Functional Programming Matters was written 25 years ago ...
Why not contrast with how FP languages are introduced in 2009 .
See e.g. Real World Haskell : full of web , gui , database , concurrent servers , and even bloomfilters for fun .
All in an introductory text .
The programming universe of 2009 is very different to that of 1984 .

I am enjoying the adavantages because I went out and learned functional programming and discovered for myself what the advanatages are .
I ( and my team ) have developed a substantial , real world , commercially available and purchased by large companies , business application in F# .
The win is that there is a reduction in code written from 4 to 10 times depending on the nature of the task .
We know this very specifically because we had some historical code that we re-wrote in F# .
The code is also significantly more maintainable and more extensible .
Of course this gives us a competitive advantage .
So maybe it is good that most are not convinced .
I have this secret weapon all to myself
Is your point that no one has yet written an article that convinces YOU of the advantages of Functional Programming ?

Thank you , that link looks promising .
@ Alex :
I am convinced .
The point of the blogpost was an idea on why many others do not seem convinced .
@dons :
The example may have been unfortunate , but I intended it as an ( exaggerated ) example of what documentation of FP languages tends to look like .
I cannot take a look at Real World Haskell without buying it ; do you know of other Haskell examples that would falsify my hypothesis ?
@RayNbow :
I intended to say that it is all and well that Fibonacci may be found in the documentation for * any * language , but that the documentation for FP languages seems to consist solely of that kind of mathematically inspired examples .

By necrobious , Sunday 22 February 2009 21:16 @dons , agreed .
I 've been making my way through Realworld Haskell ( http://book.realworldhaskell.org/ ) in my spare time , and have been amazed at how much useful information is packed into that book .
Its being called the ' pickaxe book ' and the ' camel book ' for haskell and defiantly worth picking up
By Dennis , Sunday 22 February 2009 21:20
I 'm not using a functional language yet in production , but I am using functional techniques in C# , even for some very mundane stuff .
Validating Excel uploads , for example .
I used lexical closures to build a DSL , that let me very easily specify validation rules involving logical combinations of cells .
It 's the same sort of coding they were doing in that definition of reduce , but using a mainstream language for a very prosaic task ... with the end result that I save myself an awful lot of boring repetitive work .

>Playing with Haskell - HTTP server </a >.
And there are may other examples , especially lately .
On the other hand , there are still FP people out there who would just as soon you < i > did n't < /i > think of FP as a great tool : I 'm thinking here of Paul Graham and the whole " FP as secret weapon " meme .
Finally , there are a lot of people who really are n't that concerned about how practical FP is , they 're just interested in for abstract mathematical aesthetics , blah blah blah .
( I 'm probably guilty of this , but then I teach at a liberal arts college , so I 'm allowed . )
" Avoid success at all costs " is the unofficial slogan of ( at least a certain crowd of ) Haskellers .
What 's really interesting , however , is that many of the real practical advantages of FP arose out of this very lack of concern for practical utility .
This is the " unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics " phenomenon described by the physicist Eugene Wigner .
Perhaps the best strategy to find deep , long - lasting and profound advantage for real - world work is to take this seemingly paradoxical approach : studiously ignore practical considerations , on the one hand , in order to develop good theory ; then , later , turn back to apply the more powerful tools you discover that way .
This strategy has worked for mathematics for thousands of years , after all , and the overall dialectical process has been institutionalized in the disciplinary structure of pure and applied mathematicians , scientists and engineers that have brought us modern technology .
Perhaps we should n't be surprised if this structure evolves in computing as well .
On the one hand , Don ( dons ) has it right : FP has come a long way in terms of practical stuff .
For another example ( besides the Real World Haskell book ) , see this post ( also featured on reddit ) about someone 's very positive experience putting a web server together with Haskell : Playing with Haskell - HTTP server .

Finally , there are a lot of people who really are n't that concerned about how practical FP is , they 're just interested in for abstract mathematical aesthetics , blah blah blah .
( I 'm probably guilty of this , but then I teach at a liberal arts college , so I 'm allowed . )
" Avoid success at all costs " is the unofficial slogan of ( at least a certain crowd of ) Haskellers .
What 's really interesting , however , is that many of the real practical advantages of FP arose out of this very lack of concern for practical utility .
This is the " unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics " phenomenon described by the physicist Eugene Wigner .
Perhaps the best strategy to find deep , long - lasting and profound advantage for real - world work is to take this seemingly paradoxical approach : studiously ignore practical considerations , on the one hand , in order to develop good theory ; then , later , turn back to apply the more powerful tools you discover that way .
This strategy has worked for mathematics for thousands of years , after all , and the overall dialectical process has been institutionalized in the disciplinary structure of pure and applied mathematicians , scientists and engineers that have brought us modern technology .
Perhaps we should n't be surprised if this structure evolves in computing as well .
By Don Stewart , Sunday 22 February 2009 22:45 @Confusion yep , as others have pointed out , RWH , 25 years after " Why FP Matters " is online and free .
To really hammer home how things have shifted from the abstract to the concrete , consider what one Amazon reviewer said :
" [ RWH ] cover [s ] the same amount of material the examples cover in another more mainstream language would have taken several more pages if not multiple volumes .
How many books cover file processing , regex , parsing , network programming , we programming , system programing , GUI programming and 2 different concurrency mechanisms while teaching a new language all that in around 600 pages "
So I think we have a constructive proof that the FP community is taking practical teaching and application very very seriously .
We 're all about pragmatics .
By Petey , Monday 23 February 2009 00:55
To see how FP is useful , look at Ruby on Rails .
Or even the higher - level primitives in Python ( e.g. list interpretations ) .
Many of the core design patterns from Scheme and Lisp are gradually moving into mainstream languages , but in a less abstract , more explicit way .
By Tony Morris , Monday 23 February 2009 01:46 Unconvincing .
Nope sorry , I still think it is the anti-intellectualism of the pragmatists who have infected the industry .
By BMeph , Monday 23 February 2009 05:16
Anyway , going along with the " secret weapon " theme :
Since writers in both @dons
You know , you should add a " full disclosure " blurb to your post about RWH , considering you are one of its authors , and therefore directly benefit when people get " hooked " by Haskell and buy the book ...
Anyway , going along with the " secret weapon " theme :
Since writers in both Javascript and php have added functions for programming in a functional style , it seems that the secret is out , and being catered to by those in the know .
By MeBigFatGuy , Monday 23 February 2009 05:48
At the end of the day , the language does n't really effect the normal programmer .
It 's the size of the pool of well written libraries that matter .
That 's why Java stomps on other languages .
By ekzept , Monday 23 February 2009 07:07 FP demands a massive change to the programming mindset .
There are programmers , for example , who see reduce or map and say " Well , that 's just a loop " .
It 's not .
That 's one possible implementation of it .
They are so committed to that way of thinking that they cannot see things done any other way .
But take a loop , take any program fragment .
The FP approach can be thought of as asking and seeking ultimate questions of program parameterization .
If I write a loop , why can't I pass it the body of the loop as a parameter ?
Why can't I pass a portion of the body as a parameter so I can use it elsewhere ?
Recall that one of the earlier major OO languages , Smalltalk , did and does have FP constructs tied to its Sequence classes .
That subsequent OO opted to abandon these and other dynamic constructs was a step backwards , not an improvement .
BTW , Java may " stomp " on other languages but its primacy is n't without significant question in certain fields .
Few people working numerics would give up LAPACK , or LINPACK , or NAG .
Java has issues with bare hardware .
Java 's libraries are ossified about a certain way of moving data around which may not lend itself to new ways of data management , including ones where the relational database no longer plays such an important role * especially * for big datasets .
Java can be awkward to use in mixed ( programming ) language settings .
I 'm pessimistic that producing " practical packages " in FP will turn the tide .
We have those already , as the writings of Paul Graham show ( although he speaks about LISP ) .
And there 's success to be had on a big scale , as Ericsson 's Erlang demonstrates .
I think this is about the nature of programmers committed to The Way They Now Know How To Do Things rather than anything about FP .
By Confusion , Monday 23 February 2009 07:15 @ Tony Morris :
Many in the industry simply are n't intellectuals .
It 's not anti-intellectualism : it 's non-intellectualism .
If FP is really only for intellectuals , then everyone writing in favour of it is mostly preaching to the quire .
Moreover , pragmatism cannot ' infect ' an industry : capitalist markets force industries to be as pragmatic as possible .
However , as FP has distinct advantages , pragmatism includes FP .
By Paul , Monday 23 February 2009 09:03
So then the best of both worlds would be functional programming on the JVM ?
That must be why I 'm so excited about Clojure
By Tony Morris , Monday 23 February 2009 10:18 @ Confusion
I disagree .
It is the anti-intellectuals .
Children can learn pure functional programming .
In fact , both of my two have - I put their standard well above that of my former IBM colleagues bashing away in their Java IDE and they are just normal kids .
I know of other children who have done same .
Functional Programming has caught on quite a lot .
To the extent that it has n't is the same extent to which pragmatism has indeed corrupted the faculties of reason ( PS : pragmatism does n't mean what you think it means ) .

Also , AFAIK it also implies being able to declare anonymous functions , which make it possible to do memoization and other cool generator - like stuff
The most simple practical benefit I 've had in using functional languages ( JavaScript ) has been to use callbacks in a simple manner .
I declare a function once , and then pass it as an argument to another function .
Another very useful thing is to be able to collapse the five - ten lined loop into one line , when all you want to do is iterate of one object and either return another ( map ) , check if some or all of the items meet a test ( filter ) and so on .
These are pretty practical things , all of them .

As a non-FP man , this seems like an insightful blog .
FP has always had something almost mythical to me : it seems extremely useful at things that I do n't understand and am not required to understand for my work .
It might be useful to me , but I would n't know how or where to look .
And as soon as I 'd say that out loud , I 'd have people telling me about learning a new language that I cannot use in my work environment such as Haskell .
Sure , I could spend a lot of time understanding it all and only then find out its usefulness , but it would require a lot of time , which I do n't have .
I need to be convinced quickly that every hour I invest in learning something new will be payed back over a reasonable amount of time or I 'll defer learning until I 'm forced to .
@ Tony Morris :
Your comments are exactly the kind of snobbish , elitist and excluding comments that hold back progress .
You might have the best tool / language / technique / etc. in the world , but when you belittle people who do n't use it / understand it / etc. , this perfect thing will hardly ever get used because you drive people away from you and as such , it .
You might be very good at software engineering , but you , sir , suck at people skills .
If you enjoy being right and all alone in a high and mighty tower , be sure to keep it up .
By Steven G. Harms , Monday 23 February 2009 17:11 I write Perl , functionally .
Why :
1. I work alone , pretty much .
2 . I work on a lot of projects quickly , and when I have a bug in one of them , it 's very easy to debug
sub main
{
bin ( bar ( boo ( foo( @ARGV ) ) ) )
}
does something you do n't like , it 's incredibly easy to debug .
Break in foo , did I get the data I expected ?
What did I send up the stack ?
Maybe I 'm just way too un -fancy about this programming stuff , though , but why not just say
" FP is really easy to debug since all those side effects are gone " ?
By Gabe da Silveira , Monday 23 February 2009 19:17
I studied Scheme in my undergrad and enjoyed it , but did not grok FP per se .
Like functional code itself , the explanation ( elimination of side effects ) is elegant to the point of triteness .
However I think people need to feel the pain of working with and maintaining large imperative code structures to really understand the need for FP .
The trouble with this is that the type of bugs that arise are disparate in nature , and not readily associated with the more general problem ( pervasive state ) .
A programmer without exposure to FP will simply look for an immediate solution rather than thinking " there must be a better way . "
The core problem is that it's hard to break through and communicate a solution not only to the problem at hand , but 10,000 other likely bugs that are just waiting to bite you in the ass .

I am trained in OOP , and it took about a year to change my hate towards FP ( Haskell ) into a deeper understanding of the merits of FP above OOP .
Current OOP languages are really dumb once you know about what you can easily achieve in FP .
Note that some OOP design patterns are direct part of the FP paradigm .
Switching from pure OOP to FP is a pain , but switching back to pure OOP once you 've learned FP is a pain too .
The fp community consists of people who do n't shave themselves , do n't know about fashion and are generally a few times smarter than the average programmer .
Ok , ok , not always true .
I mean that fp people are generally clever people that love to explore new algorithms and exotic techniques .
They tend to love mathematics .
This means that there examples and their research is less accessible .
Like the author of the blog post I feel these examples are less down to earth .
It takes you time to learn the fp paradigm .
To start off , you could study functions as a first
class citizen in JavaScript .
This really helps to get the core idea .
You could then move on to Haskell ,
Programs written in Haskell tends to be several times smaller than there pure OOP counterparts .
This is better for maintainability , testability and other - illities .
Also , the rise of multi core systems and the death of concurrency by threads and locking mechanisms opens the way for languages like Haskell , since multi-core programming is an easy piece in u pure functional language .
There have been made some very insightful remarks here already .

It might be unreasonable to expect to learn new concepts within the smallest time span possible and expect to reap the most benefit .
Learning costs time .
For example , ask yourself , how long did it take you to become a good imperative programmer ?
If possible , try to dig up some old code from when you were just a beginner ( say , 1 year after you started programming ) and compare it to something you have written recently .
Probably you 'd notice you have grown a lot as a programmer .
Learning a ( total ) new concept such as functional programming and to fully benefit from it also takes a lot of time .
You can not expect to be able to master it within a small time frame , just like it is impossible to completely convince someone of its benefits with just a few sentences .
Only by undertaking the journey to understand ( parts of ) the concept one can convince oneself .
The barriers to Functional Programming are the many preliminaries .
Functional languages often have a syntax deviating from mainstream languages .
While it is a minor problem , it does scare off the new people .
The different syntax , however , suits the functional paradigm , just like ( domain specific ) languages as SQL and LINQ have a syntax suitable for querying data .
Learning the syntax is learning to read .
The next barrier is to understand what you have read .
What does it mean ?
For the imperative world , most of us here already have a certain mental model of how the computation takes place , namely by executing statements step by step , altering a global state .
In the ( purely ) functional world , the model of computation is nothing more than a certain way of evaluating expressions , reducing them to simpler expressions .
This process resembles what we did in our math classes ( algebra ) in high school , where we simply replaced variables with their values .
Learning this model is needed to be able to understand what 's going on .
But this is not all there is to it .
Being able to read and understand a language , does not automatically mean we can express our thoughts in it , or at least not very well .
People learn to express themselves through practice .
By building small programs one after another , first by copying examples , then by altering them , we develop a deeper insight .
The problem here is that people often want to create something tangible and cool , i.e. something involving I/ O such that a running program 's behaviour is observable ( other than your computer box getting hot ) .
A program performing I/O is a somethig that alters some external state .
This does not directly fit into the functional programming model and thus I/O has always been a bit tricky .
Even in Haskell , where I/O actions have beautifully been modeled using monads , explaining how I/O works is not something you want to burden a beginner with .
This puts us in a dilemma .
We want beginners to play and create cool things , but we do n't want to overload them with all the nitty details .
The unfortunate result is that I/O ( and monads ) are introduced late in books and tutorials ( so no " Hello World " as a first greeting ) .
The challenge perhaps here is to present a simplified view on I/O , such that we can introduce it earlier , and revisit I/O when the beginner has become more familiar with FP .
( You might compare this to teaching Bohr 's atomic model in chemistry class before teaching the orbital model . )
On the other hand , give I/ O to beginners too early and they may stray off the path to the Dark Side , falling back to their old behaviour and solving their problems in their old and customary , stateful way .
Now , I noticed I kinda drifted off so I 'll stop typing for now .
If you want a ( 3 hours ) Haskell crash course , you could watch Simon Peyton - Jones ' talk " A Taste of Haskell " ( @MrX : It might be unreasonable to expect to learn new concepts within the smallest time span possible and expect to reap the most benefit .

I think there is a point in this article , but it is written at the wrong time .
At the moment I see a increasing interest in functional programming by developers who do not have a real academic background ( and as a result often did n't learn a functional language during their study ) .
The main reason for this is ( I think ) the new languages which mix functional and non-functional paradigms such as Scala and Fan ( and I think F# , but I do n't know this language well enough to be certain that it also allow non-functional stuff ) .
As a result of the increasing popularity of Scala ( among Java developers , since that is the world I work in ) , developers also start to gain interest in more pure functional languages such as Haskell and ( common ) Lisp ( or Clojure ) .
There are definitely some areas in ' real world ' programming which can benefit from functional programming solutions .

Because all those advantages are also disadvantages .
Stateless programs ;
No side effects
Real - world programs are all about side effects and mutation .
When the user presses a button it's because they want something to happen .
When they type in something , they want that state to replace whatever state used to be there .
When Jane Smith in accounting gets married and changes her name to Jane Jones , the database backing the business process that prints her paycheque had better be all about handling that sort of mutation .
When you fire the machine gun at the alien , most people do not mentally model that as the construction of a new alien with fewer hit points ; they model that as a mutation of an existing alien 's properties .
When the programming language concepts fundamentally work against the domain being modelled , it 's hard to justify using that language .
Concurrency ;
Plays extremely nice with the rising multi-core technology
The problem is just pushed around .
With immutable data structures you have cheap thread safety at the cost of possibly working with stale data .
With mutable data structures you have the benefit of always working on fresh data at the cost of having to write complicated logic to keep the data consistent .
It 's not like one of those is obviously better than the other .
Programs are usually shorter and in some cases easier to read
Except in the cases where they are longer and harder to read .
Learning how to read programs written in a functional style is a difficult skill ; people seem to be much better at conceiving of programs as a series of steps to be followed , like a recipe , rather than as a series of calculations to be carried out .
Productivity goes up ( example : Erlang )
Productivity has to go up a lot in order to justify the massive expense of hiring programmers who know how to program in a functional style .
And remember , you do n't want to throw away a working system ; most programmers are not building new systems from scratch , but rather maintaining existing systems , most of which were built in non-functional languages .
Imagine trying to justify that to shareholders .
Why did you scrap your existing working payroll system to build a new one at the cost of millions of dollars ?
" Because functional programming is awesome " is unlikely to delight the shareholders .
Imperative programming is a very old paradigm ( as far as I know ) and possibly not suitable for the 21th century
Functional programming is very old too .
I do n't see how the age of the concept is relevant .
Do n't get me wrong .
I love functional programming , I joined this team because I wanted to help bring concepts from functional programming into C# , and I think that programming in an immutable style is the way of the future .
But there are enormous costs to programming in a functional style that can't simply be wished away .
The shift towards a more functional style is going to happen slowly and gradually over a period of decades .
And that 's what it will be : a shift towards a more functional style , not a wholesale embracing of the purity and beauty of Haskell and the abandoning of C ++.
I build compilers for a living and we are definitely embracing a functional style for the next generation of compiler tools .
That 's because functional programming is fundamentally a good match for the sorts of problems we face .
Our problems are all about taking in raw information -- strings and metadata -- and transforming them into different strings and metadata .
In situations where mutations occur , like someone is typing in the IDE , the problem space inherently lends itself to functional techniques such as incrementally rebuilding only the portions of the tree that changed .
Many domains do not have these nice properties that make them obviously amenable to a functional style .

There is another possible locus of shortcoming : the idea itself .
Functional programming might actually just plain not be important at all .
It could be that it 's not catching on because it's an exceptionally bad idea .
It could also be that it's an idea with extremely limited applicability and that it 's caught on like wildfire in those few areas where it is even a little useful .

I think I can understand a lot for me to learn better .

US efforts to rebuild Iraq and train its armed forces have been costly US reconstruction efforts in Iraq were " grossly overburdened " by wasteful spending , according to a report by the special inspector general for Iraq .
Stuart Bowen blames a lack of security and " dramatic " course changes for the waste , but says fraud was a " relatively small " problem .
His report comes as a congressional commission set up to monitor spending has been holding its first hearings .
The US has spent nearly $ 51bn ( £ 36 bn ) on rebuilding Iraq and its army .
Officials initially estimated that the reconstruction programme would cost $ 2.4 bn .
' Learning curve ' America " was neither prepared for nor able to respond quickly to the ever - changing demands " of the programme , said Mr Bowen , the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction , in testimony before the congressional commission on wartime contracting .

" For the last six years we have been on a steep learning curve , " he added .
Mr Bowen began overseeing US expenditure on Iraq about five years ago , and his report is an attempt to set out the lessons he and his team have learned over that period .
According to the report , when he first took the job , then Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld asked him : " Why did you take this job ?
It is an impossible task . "
On his first trip to Iraq , he says in the report , he observed large quantities of cash moving out of the office of the comptroller for the Coalition Provisional Authority , after which he overheard someone say : " We ca n't do that anymore .
There is a new inspector general here . "
Mr Bowen is concerned that the mistakes made in Iraq are being repeated in Afghanistan .
" It 's too late to do the structural part and make it quickly applicable to Afghanistan , " he told the Washington Post .
President Obama should avoid having " multiple versions " of federal acquisition regulations in Afghanistan by issuing a single set of regulations " that everyone will follow " , Mr Bowen says .

World Running Out of Weapons to Fight Superbugs
In an article in the current issue of " The New England Journal of Medicine , " medical doctors Barbara Murray .
and Cesar Arias evaluate the past , present and future response to preventing and treating " superbugs , " organisms that are resistant to antibiotics .
Superbugs can evade antibiotics by by producing an enzyme that destroys the drug or creating a barrier to the drug , the doctors say .
Or superbugs can pump out any antibiotic that reaches the bacterial cell or modify the target of the antibiotic so the drug cannot bind to it .

" Most of the public has heard of MRSA [ methicillin - resistant Staphylococcus aureus ] because it produces the most cases each year , " said Murray , co-author and director of Division of Infectious Diseases at the UT Medical School .
" However , they have not heard of other superbugs that can be far worse . "
" The Gram - negative bacteria are the most antibiotic - resistant with fewer treatment options in life - threatening diseases , such as certain forms of pneumonia , bloodstream infections , gastroenteritis and even meningitis , " said Murray .
Gram - negative bacteria can release toxins created by their cell walls into the bloodstream , where it is harder to treat them , she said .
MRSA appears to be claiming more lives in the United States than HIV / AIDS .
According to an October 2007 report in the " Journal of the American Medical Association , " 94,360 U.S. patients developed an invasive infection from MRSA in 2005 and nearly one of every five , or 18,650 of them , died .
In the same year , 17,011 people died from HIV / AIDS .
Genomics is the study of an organism 's genomes to chart its DNA sequencing .
It was once viewed as a possible avenue to better weapons against superbugs , but Murray and Arias say that has not happened .
" We have run out of options .
The promise of genomics has not panned out .
Gene sequencing has not helped us find a better way to fight these bugs , " said Murray .

According to a 2004 report , " Bad Bugs , No Drugs , " by the Infectious Diseases Society of America , none of the 89 new drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration were antibiotics .
The report found that research on new antibiotics is drying up , due in part to the expense of bringing a new drug to market .
" Academics ca n't do it all .
Pharmaceutical companies can't do it all .
Everyone needs to work together to address this potential worldwide public health crisis , " said Arias , co-author of the article and assistant professor in infectious diseases at the medical school .
Murray and Arias say people taking antibiotics without prescriptions or not following their prescriptions as directed allow the antibiotics to be exposed to a wide - range of bacteria in the body , both good and bad , giving the bugs an opportunity to find ways to beat the antibiotic weapons .
" This overuse threatens the effectiveness of these precious drugs , " says Dr. Cindy Friedman , medical director of the Centers for Disease Control 's program called Get Smart : Know When Antibiotics Work .
" Doctors and patients are both part of the problem .
Studies show that if a doctor believes a patient wants an antibiotic , he or she is much more likely to prescribe one , even if the patient does n't really need one . "
Most illnesses are caused by two kinds of germs - bacteria and viruses .
Antibiotics work against infections caused by bacteria , like a strep throat .
Antibiotics do not work against viruses like the common cold , the flu and the majority of sore throats and runny noses .
Delay in diagnosis is also an issue .
Murray said even with advancements , it takes about 48 hours or more from the time a culture is taken to determine what a person may have contracted and to determine what antibiotics are likely to be effective .
The gram - negative bacteria Neisseria gonorrhoeae is responsible for the sexually transmitted disease gonorrhoea .

" It may not sound like a lot of time , but with some of these bugs you have to move quickly to save a patient .
You do n't want the bacteria to spread , " Murray said .
" Research needs to include finding new testing methods . "
" MRSA and other antibiotic - resistant bugs are one of the greatest threats facing health care today , " said Stephen Prescott , M.D. president of the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation , where researchers in November published the first visual evidence of a key piece in the puzzle of how superbugs spread antibiotic resistance in hospitals and throughout the general population .
" These infections are easily transmitted - they make their way into the body through breaks in the skin , even microscopic ones , and through nasal passages .
They resist treatment with standard antibiotics , which makes them dangerous , " said Prescott .
" And they are particularly threatening in hospitals , because they attack patients whose immune systems may already be compromised . "
The Division of Infectious Diseases at the UT Medical School is working toward solutions .
It has now established the Laboratory for Antimicrobial Research , headed by Arias , within the Center for the Study of Emerging and Re-Emerging Pathogens , headed by Murray .
Supported with funding from the National Institutes of Health , the lab aims to investigate the clinical and molecular aspects of antibiotic resistance , attempting to understand the complex mechanisms by which bugs become resistant to antibiotics and then designing new strategies to combat them .
" We are struggling , really struggling , to treat patients around the world .
If something is n't done soon , more and more bugs are going to gain the upper -hand .
There are simply not enough new drugs to keep pace with antibiotic - resistant bacterial infections , " Murray said .
" We are sounding the alarm , and hopefully the world will hear it . "

BBC News
The retired Army officer had worked in Oman , Afghanistan , Bosnia and Kosovo Willard Foxton , whose father killed himself after losing his entire life savings in the alleged Madoff fraud scandal , has spoken to the BBC about his grief and anger .
To what depths of despair must a man sink , to walk calmly into a public park near his home , lie down on a bench , put a gun to his head and pull the trigger ?
It is the question the family of retired Army officer Bill Foxton must now confront .
For on Tuesday afternoon , in broad daylight , that is precisely what he did .
It is a tale of our times .
Mr Foxton 's family believe he is - without question - the victim of the banking crisis .
A week before his death , Mr Foxton called his 28 - year - old son Willard and told him he had lost all the family money - his entire life savings , close probably to £ 1 m .
" He told me he was in a fight with his banks .
He 'd put his money in two hedge funds but they were n't returning his calls because their offices had been closed down , " he said .
" The money had all been invested with Bernie Madoff .
He was more shaken then I 'd ever heard him " .
' Walking away ' And Bill Foxton was no stranger to risk .
Since retiring from the British army in the 1970s , he had spent a 30 - year career in the defence and security industries .
He had worked in the world 's conflict zones - Oman , Bosnia , Kosovo and , until a few months ago , Afghanistan .
In 1999 he was awarded the OBE for his work in Kosovo .
It 's the little people who are left to pick up the pieces
He had been highly paid and had accrued a nest egg and retired in November at the age of 65 .
A month later , Bernie Madoff was arrested .
The fund he had run , which had been offering high rates of return to investors , turned out to be bogus .
Billions of dollars of clients ' money had disappeared .
Mr Madoff is under house arrest and , at the age of 70 , faces up to 20 years in jail .
Willard Foxton believes his father is the victim not just of Bernie Madoff but of the failures of the banking industry in general .
He contrasts his father 's fate with that of many leading bankers .
" It 's the little people who are left to pick up the pieces , " he said .
" They 're all retiring .
Even the ones who have wrecked their banks completely are walking away with millions of pounds .
" Ultimately they 're not getting a phone call saying , ' Your father 's shot [ him ] self ' . "

McDonald's :
No workers comp for employee shot protecting patron Muriel Kane
Published : Sunday February 22 , 2009
Print This Email This Fast food giant McDonald 's has denied workers compensation benefits to a minimum wage employee who was shot when he ejected a customer who had been beating a woman inside the restaurant .
A representative of the administrator for McDonald 's workers compensation plan explained that " we have denied this claim in its entirety as it is our opinion that Mr. Haskett 's injuries did not arise out of or within the course and scope of his employment . "
Nigel Haskett , then aged 21 , was working at a McDonald 's in Little Rock , Arkansas last summer when he saw a patron , later identified as Perry Kennon , smacking a woman in the face .
A surveillance video of the incident , which had been posted to YouTube , was taken down after McDonald 's charged copyright infringement , but according to written descriptions of the video , Haskett tackled Kennon , threw him out , and then stood by the door to prevent him from reentering .
( Update :
The video is now available in a news report from KARK4 in Little Rock , which is not subject to copyright claims and which can be seen below . )
Kennon went to his car , returned with a gun , and shot Haskett multiple times .
Haskett staggered back into the restaurant and collapsed .
Kennon , who has a long criminal record , was arrested a few days later and charged with first - degree battery .
The judge at his arraignment praised Haskett as a hero .
Haskett has since undergone three abdominal surgeries and has incurred over $ 300,000 in medical bills .
McDonald 's has declined to comment on their reasons for refusing his claim , because the case is still pending before the Workers Compensation Commission , but according to Haskett 's lawyer , Philip M. Wilson :
" McDonald 's position now is that during thirty - minute orientation Mr. Haskett and the other individuals going through the orientation were supposedly told that in the event of a robbery or anything like a robbery . . . not to be a hero and simply call 911 .
Mr. Haskett denies that anything like that was even mentioned during orientation or at any time during his employment with McDonald's . "
McDonald 's may be on shaky legal ground in their attempt to deny benefits .
As explained by the blog " Joe 's Union Review , " courts have repeatedly ruled that injuries incurred in the course of " good samaritan " acts while on the job are entitled to compensation , especially if they result in good will towards the employer .
" McDonalds is really living up to its reputation as an evil empire , " another blog comments .
" They re no longer merely all about moving in on the little guy , or clogging your arteries with fry grease , or making kids big chunkers , but are also now turning on their employees . "
This video was broadcast by KARK4 News and was posted at YouTube on February 22 , 2009 .

The ship set sail from the Lebanese port of Tripoli A Lebanese ship carrying aid for Gaza has been stopped by the Israeli navy and taken under escort to the Israeli port of Ashdod , Israeli officials say .
Earlier , officials in Lebanon said Israeli gunboats had fired on the ship before soldiers boarded it , although Israel denied this .
Lebanese PM Fouad Siniora has called on the international community to persuade Israel to allow the shipment through .
In the West Bank , Israeli troops have killed a Palestinian militant .
The Israeli military said Ala a - Din Abu Rop was a local commander of the armed wing of the Islamic Jihad group .
There have been sporadic incidents of violence since Hamas and Israel declared separate ceasefires on 18 January , following Israel 's three - week attack on the Gaza Strip .
Activists aboard The Togo - flagged Tali aid ship was reported to have set off from the Lebanese port of Tripoli on Tuesday carrying 50 tonnes of medical supplies , food , clothing and toys for Gaza .
Ehud Barak said the aid ship " tried to slip into Gaza waters "
Also on board were eight activists and journalists , as well as the former Greek - Catholic archbishop of Jerusalem , Monsignor Hilarion Capucci , who had served time in an Israeli jail in the 1970s for smuggling arms for the Palestine Liberation Organisation ( PLO ) .
An organiser of the shipment , Maen Bashur , said the ship had been confronted by an Israeli military boat 32 km ( 19 miles ) off the Gazan coast late on Wednesday .
" We were informed by the crew that the Israeli forces boarded the ship after firing shots at it , " he told the AFP news agency .
" We have lost contact with them . "
He said the ship was asked to turn back as " two Israeli military helicopters flew over the area and fired flares " .
The Israeli military denied troops had fired at the ship .
" No gunshots were fired on board during the boarding and capture of the cargo boat , " it said .
Israeli Defence Minister Ehud Barak said the Israeli navy had requested the ship head towards Egypt , and only boarded it after it headed back towards Gaza .
" At first the ship understood we were prohibiting it from heading to Gaza and steered towards El - Arish [ in Egypt ] , " he said .
" From Egyptian territorial waters it tried to slip into Gaza waters .
That is when the Israeli navy boarded it . "
The army said the crew of the ship would be questioned by police , while all humanitarian goods found on board would be transferred to Gaza by land Search Ala a - Din Abu Rop was shot dead by Israeli troops during a raid on his home near Jenin , in the West Bank , on Thursday .
An Israeli military spokesman said the 21 - year - old was suspected of involvement in attacks on Israelis .
He was fully armed when troops stormed his home , and weapons and ammunition were found during the search , the military said .
Ala a - Din Abu Rop 's father said his son had been sleeping , alongside his brothers , when soldiers broke into the house before dawn .

Barter Your Professional Website Design Services
for
Upscale Hair Salon Services in Equal Value
i.e. $ 500.00 in website services = $ 500.00 in salon services which can be performed at different times .
The salon services you barter for can be gifted by you to another person .
All barter terms subject to a formal Barter Agreement .
All salon services performed at the Salon , located in a west suburb of Minneapolis , MN .
After doing a little research I 've found that some very talented web design and marketing people live and work right here in the Twin Cities .
Talented professionals always seem to gravitate to other talented professionals so it makes perfect sense to pursue a barter relationship of this kind .
By way of introduction my name is Kevin Thomas and I 'm a business advisor working with the principal of the salon .
She desires to keep her expansion plans confidential .
As far as the website is concerned she does n't want anyone outside of her trusted business circle to know about it , until it goes live .
The principal has been in the salon business , starting in Uptown , for a long time and is regarded as one of the top stylist - colorist - operators in the Twin Cities .
She 's very well known and word of mouth advertising has built her business to the extent that there is about a six week wait to see her personally .
Now , she wishes to leverage that reputation to expand her business .
One of her priorities is to have a new website built , tested and operating in the very near future .
The salon 's current site is rough , somewhat amateurish and exists only as a placeholder .
The new site must be unique ( no cookie cutter ' out of the box ' ) without being too glitzy .
We 'd like it to incorporate contemporary themes while at the same time being easy to use , intuitive , interactive and fast loading .
Our vision is for the site to be very relevant and informational for the user .
It should tell the story of the salon and its founder , and then allow the user to interact by making a reservation request or to initiate and complete a product purchase transaction .
In the main her clientele is female , wealthy and very busy .
They hold their time to be precious and they spend it judiciously .
Her website should especially appeal to the sensitivities of people like that .
It should be designed with SEO in mind , but not primary .
Local Google searches ideally should return page one results , but searches originating outside of the twin cities trade area are of less interest [ at this time ] .
It should be built to function in as many of the older browsers as possible while looking good and working well on a cell phone / PDA .
After the design and build work has been completed we would like to have full use of the art work , copy and fonts as well as templates which will allow us to add content to the site at will .
I can promise you that anybody would be very pleased to have their hair style and color designed and performed by this talented lady .
As I mentioned earlier , reservations for personal appointments with her typically need to be made six weeks in advance , despite the fact that her prices are among the highest in this market .
It 's so true that the finest services and products are always in demand .

If the Obama stimulus package passes , never before in history will a larger fraud be perpetuated against the hard working American taxpayer .
A stimulus package that creates too much debt does not stimulate the economy so much as temporarily " overdrives it " followed by a bust when we need to pay the debt off .
The US taxpayers will have to pay interest on the debt and the borrowing will take money that was available for investment and lock it up in government debt .
If the US government would not have borrowed the money , then the money would have been available for industry and individuals to borrow for productive purposes .
If on average , the taxpayers only pay 4 % interest on the government bonds - interest rates will get higher in the future , this works out to 36 billion dollars a year .
Divide the 36 billion a year by the number of taxpayers paying income tax and it comes out to $ 400 a year in interest for every tax payer .
This is on top of all the other government obligations .
People should consider whether or not their children and grandchildren should be required to pay hundreds of dollars in interest every year just to payoff Obama 's political friends .
This is perhaps why over half of the stimulus package is directed to Unions .
Much of the rest of the stimulus package goes to make work job type programs and liberal causes .
But consider , should every taxpayer be liable for $ 5,000 to pay back the Obama supporters ?
Obama promised 3 million jobs with a stimulus bill building infrastructure .
The hard reality is that there is no way to have a net increase of 3 million jobs in the next couple of years building infrastructure or by other government programs but Obama campaigned hard on the stimulus and still would like to reward his supporters .
900,000,000,000 / 306,000,000 = $ 2,950 per person .
138,000,000 people file a tax return .
Over 1/3 of taxpayers pay no income tax .
So the tax burden for the stimulus package would go to about 90,000,000 taxpayers .
900,000,000,000 / 90,000,000 = $ 10,000 per taxpayer .
1 ) Obama 's 900 billion stimulus bill .
US population is about 306,000,000 people right now .
The current size of the stimulus package that is being discussed is more than 900 billion .
The amount of money per person is :
2 ) Obama even after vetting and finding out various potential nominees are tax evaders and tax cheats , he has nominated them anyway .
Therefore filling some of the highest government positions including the Treasury Secretary and head of the IRS with tax cheats .
What does this say to the average American tax payer ?
It says to me either that it is fine to cheat on taxes unless you get caught or else it is fine to cheat on your taxes is you have politically powerful connections .
3 ) Immediately closing Guantanamo bay and suspending military tribunals on terrorists there .
If he wants to close the facility , he should have created a committee to figure out how to do it in a rational manner .
4 ) Tries to reverse substantially all of Bush 's executive orders immediately - an incredibly stupid thing for any president to do in first days in office .
Executive orders are the orders not just of one man but an administration and usually address some problem .
It is impossible to reverse 8 years worth of executive orders and replace them with something else right away .
There is little question in my mind that Obama has shown himself to have the single worst record ever in the first month in office .
Can we stand another 3 years and 11 months of this ?
The four worst decisions of Obama are :
COMMENT # 2 [ Permalink ]
... Brad Friedman said on 2/11/2009 @ 11:15 am PT ...
Yvonne Ricks -
Though your note wreaks a bit of copy and pasted talking point shill spam , I do n't have time to track down the original source for now , so will presume , for the moment , that you actually believe what you 've posted above .
I 'll also , kindly , overlook the fact that it 's almost completely off topic from the original post .
You 're welcome .
That said , I 'm no particular defender of Obama's , or Democrats , but bullshit is bullshit , and you need to be called out ( again , on the presumption you 're actually sincere , rather than simply posting knowing disinfo ) .
So I 'll respond briefly to some of your talking points .
4 ) Tries to reverse substantially all of Bush 's executive orders immediately - an incredibly stupid thing for any president to do in first days in office .
Using this metric , I guess you 'd have to include Bush 's first four weeks as " worst in history " as well , since he did the same thing .
Somehow , I feel you 'd like to over look that .
Moreover , a bad executive order is a bad executive order , and as far as I can tell , the ones that the Obama Admin is reviewing and / or reversing , are orders that are very bad .
So I have no idea why you believe that would think such responsible behavior is somehow a mark against Obama .
3 ) Immediately closing Guantanamo bay and suspending military tribunals on terrorists there .
If he wants to close the facility , he should have created a committee to figure out how to do it in a rational manner .
He did n't " immediately close Guantanamo " .
You 've either been misinformed , or do n't care .
He ordered that it be shut down within a year .
Big difference .
( Even if I 'd rather have had him close it down immediately , as you wrongfully asserted he did ) .
Suspending military tribunals , many of which have been illegal up until now , or incredibly poorly carried out --- such that there is not even evidence collated for most of those being held , despite years in captivity --- makes perfect sense , of course .
In fact , many of those prisoners may end up going free , eventually , even the ones who should n't , if the tribunals are n't reviewed .
Check your facts , because it seems you have no clue what you 're talking about here .
2 ) Obama even after vetting and finding out various potential nominees are tax evaders and tax cheats , he has nominated them anyway .
Therefore filling some of the highest government positions including the Treasury Secretary and head of the IRS with tax cheats .
The Treasure Secretary and the head of the IRS , in the context you 're using it , are the same person : Timothy Geithner .
So , even if you believe he is a " tax cheat " ( which he may be , as far as I know ) , he is not " tax cheats " ( plural ) .
Therefore , unless you are aware of something I 'm not , he has not " fill[ed ] some of the highest governmnent positions ... with tax cheats . "
I make no excuse for his having nominated others with questionable tax issues ( notably , Daschle , as the others I 've heard about are ridiculous issues . )
But it'd be nice if you got your facts correct rather than risking becoming the " Worse Commenter in BRAD BLOG history for a first time Commenter " .
Finally , your " number 1 worst decision " is the most filled with nonsense and debunked GOP talking points , but I 'll touch on a few of them .
For a start , again , I 'm not defending the package .
I 'll leave that up to others .
I am , however , defending facts .
Particularly the ones which you simply make up , or pass along , though already debunked elsewhere .
Obama promised 3 million jobs with a stimulus bill building infrastructure .
The hard reality is that there is no way to have a net increase of 3 million jobs in the next couple of years
He promised no such thing .
He said he hoped to create or save 3 million jobs ( actually , it may have been 2 , I can't recall , but that 's not my point here ) .
Again , he said he hoped the plan would create or save x number of jobs .
Big difference .
Obama campaigned hard on the stimulus and still would like to reward his supporters .
That 's just silly .
Does n't even merit response , since a ) it 's wholly without substance and b) George W. Bush spent 8 years , explicitly --- and with miles of evidence to demonstrate it , and for much much larger sums --- doing exactly that .
Did you bother to call him out on that anywhere ?
If so , please share the URL with us .
Much of the rest of the stimulus package goes to make work job type programs and liberal causes .
Pure GOP talking point nonsense .
" Make work " gave you away , chief .
The prhase is both meaningless , and otherwise , incorrect .
But consider , should every taxpayer be liable for $ 5,000 to pay back the Obama supporters ?
Maybe , maybe not .
And a perfectly legitimate question to ask and discuss .
Had the rest of your screed been as reasonably writ , you 'd not be getting smacked down for idiocy at this point .
A stimulus package that creates too much debt does not stimulate the economy so much as temporarily " overdrives it " followed by a bust when we need to pay the debt off .
Again , not sure I agree with you , but I 'm not an economist , and had you brought up just these points , you might not have given away your GOP shill status and we 'd welcome a legitimate conversation about it .
The US taxpayers will have to pay interest on the debt and the borrowing will take money that was available for investment and lock it up in government debt .
If the US government would not have borrowed the money , then the money would have been available for industry and individuals to borrow for productive purposes .
That point is pure nonsense .
The reason we 're in this mess , is that there is no borrowing going on , because the banks have locked up the money .
You 've heard of " the bailout " right ?
The TARP program ( for better or worse , ) that makes money available to institutions to try and open up lending again , since the Government , at this point , is the only one who can borrow money ?
There is no substance to your allegation that private borrowers will have a smaller pool from which to borrow , because the government has locked it up .
If you have any evidence to the contrary , I hope you 'll share the URL with us .
People should consider whether or not their children and grandchildren should be required to pay hundreds of dollars in interest every year just to payoff Obama 's political friends .
Too bad you ruined your own legitimate point by tossing in that " Obama 's political friends " bullshit .
Had you avoided that , we might have had a conversation about the otherwise legiimate question you were asking about the cost of the program to future generations .
( I 'd likely argue the cost will be much greater to future generations if this is n't done , and that you did n't bother making the same argument when it was Bush running up your grandkids tabs far higher , but at least we could have had the discussion ) .
If the Obama stimulus package passes , never before in history will a larger fraud be perpetuated against the hard working American taxpayer .
Not true .
Your comment here might well qualify in that category .

When not doodling at work , Sudoku keeps Dave Sykes from USA awake , interested and sane .
Cheers for a 30 something married guy who manages to keep his job while still uploading his doodles to Flickr for us .
The process is simple and well described by Sykes : Work ... bored ...
Sudoku ... sketch ... the margins provide space to doodle when the numbers make my brain hurt .
Maybe Sudoku is the only thing keeping me sane at work , between calls .

Beautiful Killer Sudoku records
This professional - looking snapshot of a Killer Sudoku record sheet was taken in February 2009 by a number logic fan named Alasdair Nicol from Berlin , Germany .
" You ca n't beat the Guardian puzzle page on a Saturday ; Sudoku , Killer Sudoku and Futoshiki all on one page " says Alasdair .
" After messing up the grid in the newspaper , I had to copy it by hand for a second attempt " .
The result is shown above .

Never too young for a Sudoku records
Aaron Wormus was walking through the bookstore with his 5 year old daughter when the young lady asked for her own Sudoku book and got one , suitable for kids .
About 10 minutes after Annie understood the simple rules of Sudoku she came back with her first solved one .
" Pretty impressive for a 5 - year - old " says Wormus .
We very much agree .

Agony Sudoku records
Part of Robert Bryn 's spiritual practice / self - improvement regimen in L.A. is sitting by the pool and working on Sudoku .
The above doodle was made on an airplane during one of Bryn 's flights .
" I was having such a hard time with the puzzle that I made a mess of it in the airline magazine " says Bryn .
" I copied it into my graph paper notebook and made a little drawing while I was agonizing over it .
Some Sudoku puzzles are just a little bit too hard , are n't they ?
Consolation Sudoku records
And while we are on the subject of agony puzzles here is another guy nicknamed Cheego who was travelling in bad conditions , tired and worried .
" It was too difficult to even think to use the Moleskine for drawings , poems , or intelligent things " says Cheego so the only remaining option was coming up with his own doodled Sudoku .
We are not sure what exactly Cheego means by " intelligent things " ( perhaps Pic - a - Pix ? ) but if you are wondering what a Moleskine might be : it 's a very stylish brand of notebook manufactured by an Italian company that holds the same name .

There ’s been considerable media attention surrounding a recent breakthrough in the development of a male birth - control pill ( MBCP ) .
Fact of the matter is that it ’s still about 5 to 10 years away .
It ’s taking forever for a men ’s pill to come to market .
What ’s taking so long ?
Well , the issue is not as simple as it might first appear .
Sure , there are still some technical hurdles to overcome , but the delay in developing a MBCP has definite political , economic and even discriminatory aspects to it .
Barriers to entry do in fact exist for the male pill — disempowering barriers that men should most certainly be aware of — including those set up by sexist women who belittle male reproductive accountability , unfair gender biases , self - serving feminists who refuse to relinquish reproductive power , and a risk averse Big Pharma .
And men themselves are also to blame .
Far too many guys have gotten comfortable over the idea that birth - control pills are exclusive to women .
Most men have not yet realized the implications of having access to a pill of their own .
Consequently ( and quite disturbingly ) , conversations about the male pill have migrated outside the sphere of male interests .
Women tend to frame the issue as it pertains to their concerns and their needs , while politicians and pharmaceutical companies neglect the issue , unsure as to what it means to them .
Ultimately , however , this is about men .
It ’s about men gaining fair and equal access to a powerful contraceptive that will finally allow them to have the same control over their reproductive processes as women — an outcome that will greatly benefit male interests .
How the male pill works
An international consortium of physicians recently revealed a formula for “ safe , effective and reversible ” hormonal contraception for males .
The breakthrough involves progestin , which is found in women ’s birth - control pills and the male sex hormone testosterone .
Progestin helps suppress ovulation when used in an oral contraceptive and it appears to function in the same way for men , suppressing the rate and extent of sperm production .
The developers claim that this contraceptive will be as effective as a vasectomy .
Men will have to take the pill for about 2 to 3 months to deplete their sperm .
It will take a similar amount of time to restore normal levels of fertility once off the pill .
Bring it
For the most part , both men and women appear to be in favor of the MBCP .
Trouble is , most men and women do n’t truly understand why it ’s so important .
Particularly women .
Now , I do n’t mean to begrudge women their reasons for welcoming the male pill .
It ’s all good .
I think it ’s great that couples will finally be able to share the burden of birth control .
And it will undoubtedly be a welcome alternative for those women who cannot take the pill or other contraceptives ( of which there are many ) .
There ’s also the issue of accessibility .
A 2004 report from the Reproductive Health Technologies Project calls contraceptive availability an “ unfinished revolution . ”
Indeed , we need more contraception and more options .
But this is fundamentally an issue of male reproductive control
This is a male issue about male reproduction .
And all that it entails .
The pill will resolve a number problems that men typically face .
It will be dramatically less invasive and severe than a vasectomy — a procedure that can be reversed , but one that ’s quite involved and not always possible .
The male pill will also prove to be much more reliable than condoms or withdrawal which can have worst - case failure rates of 15 and 27 percent respectively (!!! ) .
Also , the male pill will have a profound sociological impact similar to what happened after the advent of the female birth - control pill .
This will prove to be a seminal event as far as the men ’s movement is concerned .
In fact , a strong case can be made that the delay in the male pill has been caused by an underdeveloped male social movement .
The sense of urgency to develop a MBCP has been quelled by the dissenters and the disconnected .
Men need to be aware of those forces that work to prevent the advent of not just the male pill , but a cohesive and powerful men ’s rights movement itself .
Negative male stereotyping
The possibility of a male pill has caused a number of women to pause and reflect on the implications .
Should a woman believe a guy who says , “ Trust me , baby , I ’m on the pill . ” ?
Most women would likely say no .
It ’s doubtful that women would put faith in men to stick to a strict schedule of birth - control pill popping .
Men are supposed to be untrustworthy and irresponsible , right ?
After all , they ’re not the ones who would have to deal with a pregnancy .
Aside from what this says about negative male stereotyping , this complaint neglects three fundamental issues .
First , people must take control over their own reproductive processes and not rely on the other person .
This goes for both men and women .
The MBCP will finally help men know for certain that they have virtually no chance of impregnating a partner .
Which immediately brings to mind the problem of trust that many men are confronted with today .
Should men trust women when they make the same claim ?
How many times has a man been duped into fatherhood by an opportunistic woman ?
Well , according to a Cornell University study , over a million American births each year result from pregnancies which men did not intend .
What does this say about female reproductive accountability ?
The male pill , will at the very least , help men avoid this risk .
Second , the MBCP strictly deals with contraception .
It will do nothing to prevent the spread of sexually transmitted diseases .
The advent of a male pill will not eliminate the need to wear a condom as far as STDs are concerned .
And third , most men do in fact deal with a pregnancy and the introduction of an unexpected child — be it parental or fiscal responsibilities .
There are more accountable single dads who have joint custody of their children than ever before in history .
An unwelcome power shift
As Glenn Sacks has said , “ Power is the reward which comes with responsibility . ”
Indeed , because women have had to bear the burden of contraception , they have gained control over an integral component of human life , namely reproduction .
The MBCP threatens to wrest that control from women to men .
Quite understandably , some feminists are concerned about this possibility .
And , I ’m sorry to say , that ’s too bad .
Men are currently at a distinct disadvantage when it comes to the choice of reproduction — but this is now set to change .
As an example , according to the 2004 National Scruples and Lies Survey ( which polled 5,000 women in the United Kingdom ) , 42 % of women claimed they would lie about contraception in order to get pregnant , regardless of the wishes of their partners .
Wow .
Other evidence suggests that over 10 % of children turn out not to be the offspring of the expected father when DNA tests are done , suggesting that many men obliviously help in the raising of children who are not actually theirs .
This is no laughing matter .
Child support rates are increasing , with some fathers giving their ex’s as much as 15 to 25 % of their take home pay per child .
And it ’s widely known that fathers are second class citizens in the courts .
For example , in some U.S. states a father cannot present DNA evidence to disprove paternity .
For those men who truly do n’t want to have children — something that is completely within their rights — the MBCP will help them achieve that level of control .
And again , female claims that this will allow men to forever shirk their paternal responsibilities and live in perpetual adolescence are not just gross generalizations , but sexist statements of the highest order .
The Man is holding men down
Quite surprisingly , Big Pharma has dragged their feet in developing the MBCP .
Despite over 20 years of research , they claim that there ’s little money to be made .
In fact , that ’s one of the main reasons that the pharmaceutical firms Bayer and Organon abandoned their male pill programs last year .
This is because men are not demanding it
Men are clearly not showing Big Pharma that they want a male pill .
Research shows that most males are not ready for personal birth control .
A recent MSN - Zogby poll revealed that only 14 % of Americans would definitely take it or insist that their partner take it .
And tellingly , the study indicated that women are slightly more excited about the prospect than men .
While at the same time other studies show that men do in fact want alternative contraception options .
What ’s going on here , guys ?
Perhaps confusion has something to do with it .
There ’s a very underdeveloped sense of a male collective consciousness .
It appears that men , for the most part , do n’t yet realize the importance of reproductive control — something women have , for obvious reasons , been very aware of for quite some time now .
Some men , for example , dismiss the male pill on account of their fear that it would transgress their masculinity .
This is exactly the mentality that has to be abandoned and replaced by some more forward thinking ideas that will work help equalize not just reproductive options , but other gender issues that set men at a disadvantage or limit biological potential .
Times they are a changin ’
Perhaps I ’m understating the fact that 14 % of men are ready to use the pill .
That ’s a significant number unto itself .
Maybe it ’s a positive sign that attitudes are changing and that broader acceptance is on its way .
In all likelihood , demand will probably increase once the pill is finally made available .
It will become real for men once it becomes a real option .
And hopefully it will wake men up to the possibilities .
Issues of gender , sexuality and reproduction are not just women ’s issues .
They ’re a vital element of the collective human condition .

( CNN ) -- Scientists in Colombia have unearthed the remains of a true prehistoric monster believed to be the biggest snake ever to have lived on Earth .
An artist 's impression of what Titanoboa cerrejonensis would have looked like .
Named Titanoboa cerrejonensis , the snake would have weighed 1,140 kilograms ( 2,500 pounds ) and measured 13 meters ( 42.7 feet ) nose to tail tip -- dwarfing the largest modern pythons and anacondas which can grow to 6 meters ( 19.5 feet ) .
Scientists believe it slithered around the planet between 58 and 60 million years ago .
Geologist David Polly , who identified the position of the fossil vertebrae which made a size estimate possible , said in a statement Wednesday : " At its greatest width , the snake would have come up to about your hips .
The size is pretty amazing .
" But our team went a step further and asked , how warm would the Earth have to be to support a body of this size ? "
Titanoboa 's fossilized remains were discovered at a coal mine in the tropical Cerrejon region of northern Colombia by an international team of scientists .
" Truly enormous snakes really spark people 's imagination , but reality has exceeded the fantasies of Hollywood , " paleontologist Jonathan Bloch , who co-led the expedition , told reporters .
" The snake that tried to eat Jennifer Lopez in the movie ' Anaconda ' was not as big as the one we found . "
Based on the snake 's size , the team was able to calculate that the mean annual temperature in equatorial South America 60 million years ago would have been about 91 degrees Fahrenheit , about 10 degrees warmer than today , Bloch said .
" Tropical ecosystems of South America were surprisingly different 60 million years ago , " said Bloch .
" It was a rainforest , like today , but it was even hotter and the cold - blooded reptiles were all substantially larger .
" The result was , among other things , the largest snakes the world has ever seen ... and hopefully ever will . "
According to Nature.com , snakes are poikilotherms ( cold - blooded ) that , unlike humans , need heat from their environment to power their metabolism .
Therefore research suggests that at the time the region would have had to be no less than 86 to 93 degrees Fahrenheit for the snake to have survived .
Most large snakes today live in the tropical regions of South America and south - east Asia , where the high temperatures allow them to grow to impressive sizes .
Meanwhile , Carlos Jaramillo -- who was also part of the expedition -- said the tropical rainforest at Cerrejon appeared to have thrived at these temperatures .
" This data challenges the view that tropical vegetation lives near its climatic optimum , and it has profound implications in understanding the effect of current global warming on tropical plants , " he said .

Rep. Pete Hoekstra ( R - Mich . ) has been catching a lot of flak for his addiction to Twitter : During a recent congressional visit to Iraq , Hoekstra discovered that he had BlackBerry service in Baghdad ( " Just landed in Baghdad .
I believe it may be first time I 've had bb service in Iraq " ) and went on to post several tweets as he moved around the capital .
The congressional trip was supposed to be a secret , but Hoekstra – a member of the House Intelligence Committee – broke the embargo with his Twitter updates .
Congressional Quarterly 's sharp - eyed John Donnelly took note ; Twitterversy ensued .
As anyone who 's caught the Rhino to the Green Zone knows , revealing information about convoy movements or itineraries is a big operational security no -no .
Same goes for VIP trips to war zones .
Courtney Littig , the spokeswoman for the Democrats on the Intelligence Committee , told the New York Times : “ Generally speaking , we encourage the members to hold off on any communication until they are wheels down at Andrews Air Force Base . ”
Hoekstra 's defense , posted yesterday on his website : Democrats do it too .
" President Obama , Speaker Pelosi , Secretary Clinton , and even Chairman Reyes are among the many Democrats who have announced their travel to Iraq or other sensitive destinations before arrival or while in country , and have participated in publicized events abroad before returning to the United States , " he said .
Partisan sniping aside , this whole controversy says more about the paranoiac level of official security that persists to this day in Iraq , despite the drop in violence .

The soldier had been in Afghanistan for " a number of weeks " and was about one - third of the way through his tour , Air Chief Marshal Houston said .
He had previously been deployed in East Timor .
His family had been notified of his death .
Air Chief Marshal Houston said the warmer months of the year were the time when the Taliban was more active .
Activity had been more intense than in any previous campaign season in the seven years that Australian forces had been there .
" I guess we can anticipate if we have a relatively mild winter that ... the tempo of operations will continue at a higher level than we 've seen in the past , " he said .
" It depends a lot on the weather .
If we have a bad winter that could shut down their operations altogether . "
The situation in Afghanistan remained " very dangerous " and Defence had a number of operations running in the province .
" Sadly , sometimes we lose those who are among our finest and most courageous , " he said .
The Defence Force would not release further details about the soldier at present , he said .
Rudd offers nation 's condolences
The Prime Minister , Kevin Rudd , offered the nation 's thoughts and prayers to the family of the dead soldier this morning - a refrain almost identical to that delivered a month ago after the death of Australian commando Michael Fussell , also in Afghanistan .
" This brave soldier , wearing the uniform of Australia , died in the fields of duty , wearing his nation 's uniform and wearing it with pride , '' Mr Rudd said .
" Our prayers and those of the entire nation are with his family and his friends and his loved ones on this most tragic of days . ''
Mr Rudd said the soldier - whose family has asked his name not be released - was killed when Taliban insurgents launched a rocket attack on an Afghan forward - operating base .
He would not say how many Australians were present .
" I 've said before that there 's no higher calling for any Australian than to wear the uniform of Australia , " he said .
" And on a difficult and tragic day , such as today , we are reminded of the cost of wearing that uniform and that is to ultimately surrender your life for your country . "
Mr Rudd said he would not reconsider troop numbers in Afghanistan , despite the eight Australian deaths there since 2001 .
" [ It ] is an important part of the war against terrorism , the war against al - Qaeda , " he said .
" It is also part and parcel of our obligations to our allies and friends , given that this war in Afghanistan began following the terrorist attacks on September 11 [ 2001 ] . "
More than 1000 Australian troops in Afghanistan About 1090 Australian troops are in Afghanistan as part of Operation Slipper , which began in 2002 .
The two main groups operating out of Oruzgan are the Mentoring and Reconstruction Task Force and the Special Operations Task Group .
The soldier is the eighth Australian soldier to be killed in Afghanistan .
An Australian man fighting with British defence forces in Afghanistan was killed a week before Christmas .
Dual British - Australian national Stuart Nash , 21 , was killed fighting with Britain 's 1st Battalion in Helmand province , a volatile area in the south .
Australian soldier Lieutenant Michael Fussell , 25 , died on November 27 in a roadside bomb explosion in the country 's Oruzgan province .

This just in , America ’s youth are a bunch of narcissitically self - entitled little snots .
I ’m thinking of an anti-drug commercial right now .
Can you guess which one ?
The paper of record ( Max Roosevelt ) , tells me that universities are dealing with “ grade disputes ” and that the probable cause is “ student expectation ” .
In other words , “ My grades are n’t as high as I think they should be , so we have a dispute . ”
Really , it is n’t fair .
You work , like , really really hard all semester .
Ya know , like , going to every class and even reading all of the books that the professor assigns .
You could n’t possibly , like , receive , like , a C for that .
You even took the time to learn how to use an apostrophe and everything .
We ’ll get Grampa Bud ’s statement out of the way early , “ Who ever told you that life was fair ? ”
Jason Greenwood of the University of Maryland sums up the student perspective :
“ If you put in all the effort you have and get a C , what is the point ? ” he added .
“ If someone goes to every class and reads every chapter in the book and does everything the teacher asks of them and more , then they should be getting an A like their effort deserves .
If your maximum effort can only be average in a teacher ’s mind , then something is wrong . ”
If you did n’t get an A , it ’s because you did n’t do everything that the teacher asked – and more .
Or maybe it ’s because you really have no business being in a university … but i do n’t want to sound elitist or anything .
The professors did n’t weigh in much .
This is not surprising as it ’s hard to quote someone kicking over the trash can for the tenth time that day , or convey what it looks like when someone pulls out a handful of his / her own hair .
What little they said boils down to , “ there ’s a problem with the sense of entitlement among students , ” and , unfortunately , the mutterings with which they fleshed out this thesis did not get published .
What a professor did do was launch a study to quantify just how much snot runs out of the noses of the student body .
Ellen Greenberger found that two thirds of students surveyed said that explaining to a professor that they were trying hard should count towards a better grade .
It will be great fun to see this horde descend upon the workplace in a few years time and tell their bosses that trying hard should be factored into getting a raise .
Professor Greenberger ends up making a bunch of excuses for the kids .
It might be a “ heightened sense of achievement anxiety . ”
In which case we can only hope that there is a pill in the pharma - pipeline that can ease achievement anxiety .
Competition and pressure may also be major factors in the whining temper tantrums about what ’s deserved and unfair .
To this end , some institutions are attempting to ease the students into learning for the sake of knowledge rather than the end result of a grade .
Another theory posits that the students became high efficiency test takers through high school and just can’t handle professors expecting them to think and express their thoughts .
Bullshit .
They ’ve been coddled and told that they ’re special for their whole lives .
Here ’s a lesson for the youth out there reading that wo n’t even cost one credit hour of tuition : you ’re not special ; you never will be special …at least not any more special than anyone else .
A few of you are actually special , but you ’re not bitching about how you should get an A for effort because you ’re special .
It ’s a big , mean world out there and you ’re going to have to take off the diapers someday .
Or maybe you do n’t think that you ’ll have to take off the diapers , and that ’s a more serious issue than whether or not a professor gives you the grade you expect .
The professors , however , do n’t get the worst of it .
From what i can gather , the administrative offices at universities spend a silly amount of time dealing with this issue .
Worse than the students are the parents who call to set things right for their baby and have been known to go so far as threatening legal action when the university is n’t being “ fair ” .
If Mommy is still making phone calls on behalf of baby when baby reaches his twenties , we can safely assume that teachers throughout baby ’s academic career have been hearing from mommy about how the family expects their baby to be treated .
Did you guess which anti-drug commercial i’ve been thinking of ?
It ’s the one where dad bursts in on little boy smoking pot and gets off the handle enraged , culminating in his screaming , “ Where did you learn to do this ? ”
The boy , who had found his dad ’s box of fun paraphernalia , looks up and says , “ I learned it from you , Dad , ” tearfully , “ I learned it from you . ”
And so we conclude another chapter of The Decline and Fall of Western Snivelization .
BEIJING -- China 's exports slowed dramatically last month and imports plummeted , highlighting the effects of the global slowdown on the world 's third - largest economy and the failure of its stimulus program to gain traction so far .
Exports in January fell 17.5 % from a year earlier and imports dropped 43.1 % , according to Chinese government data released Wednesday .
That boosted the country 's trade surplus -- at the center of recent criticism from Washington -- to $ 39.11 billion .

It is yet another glaring example there is no difference between Bush , Obama , or anybody else anointed by the global elite to serve as presidential window dressing — the Daily Telegraph reports this morning that former Reichsminister of State and Rockefeller minion Henry Kissinger was dispatched by the Obama administration to talk with Russian president Dmitry Medvedev about reducing stockpiles of nuclear warheads .
Kissinger met with Putin at the Russian Prime Minister ’s country house outside of Moscow .
“ The decision to send Mr. Kissinger to Moscow , taken by Mr Obama when he was still president - elect , is part of a plan to overcome probable Republican objections in Congress , ” reports Adrian Blomfield , Moscow correspondent for the British newspaper .
It is said the “ secret negotiations ” were conducted in December .
Obama , of course , runs nothing and the reprehensible octogenarian war criminal Kissinger was dispatched on orders of the elite , not Obama .
It is said Kissinger had a sit - down with former Russian boss Vladimir Putin at his country house outside of Moscow .
“ While the details of the ambitious initiative are yet to be revealed , the proposal to return to the negotiating table after eight years of reluctance in Washington has been welcomed in Britain and elsewhere , ” reports the Daily Telegraph .
No doubt a fly on the wall of Putin ’s country house would reveal other topics of discussion , as the elite and the military - industrial complex have made trillions on the phony “ Cold War ” and its subsequent permutations over the decades and really has no desire to slash nuclear warheads , not unless they can make a bunch of money in the process .
“ Mr Obama apparently chose Mr Kissinger for his consummate diplomatic skills and his popularity in Moscow , an affection earned by his open acknowledgment of Russia ’s international resurgence . ”
Kissinger ’s “ consummate diplomatic skills ” are well - known — over the years he has micromanaged the bombing of small and defense countries and is responsible for the murder of millions of people , most notably a few million Vietnamese , Cambodians , and Indonesians .
It is absurd to think Obama chose Kissinger or anybody else for that matter .
Obama , like all previous presidents in the modern era , is little more than a wind - up doll with notable oratory skills and a knack for reading teleprompters .
Along with Obama foreign policy guru and notorious Russia - hater Zbigniew Brzezinski , Kissinger is a Rockefeller functionary and Trilateral Commission member .
He is also a prominent Bilderberg member and long time member of the Council on Foreign Relations .
He worked for the Rockefeller Brothers Fund as director of its Special Studies Project .
The CFR , Trilateral Commission , and the Bilderbergers have one objective — to create world government under the guise of a New World Order .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
It is safe to say the meeting with Medvedev and Putin had more to do with the New World Order than reducing the number of nukes in Russia and the United States .
Last month , Kissinger went on the pages of the International Herald Tribune and called for a New World Order .
During an interview with CNBC ’s Mark Haines and Erin Burnett on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange , Kissinger said the anointment of Barack Obama represents an “ opportunity ” to create a New World Order “ at a moment when there is upheaval in many parts of the world simultaneously , ” never mind the fact these upheavals are orchestrated by the elite and the international bankers .
Of more immediate importance than any number of nuclear warheads is Russia ’s strategic relationship with China and Iran and its relations with Cuba , Venezuela and Brazil .
Moreover , Putin and the Russians have vehemently opposed the Soros / Freedom House / CIA sponsored revolutions in former Soviet republics and have signaled their intention to resist these globalist sponsored so - called revolutions .
“ A system of permanent revolutions , rose revolutions or some others , is the most dangerous , ” Putin told Interfax on December 23 , 2004 , well before the U.S. orchestrated provocation in South Ossetia .
It is no secret , as well , the globalists are irked by Russia ’s nationalization of the Yukos oil - producing division by Rosnfet .
Putin became somewhat of a hero to the anti-globalist movement when he wrestled “ power from multinational corporations , multilateral institutions , and the global economic system they promote , ” as Liliana N. Proskuryakova described it .
In addition , the Russians have consistently resisted the loan - sharking operations of the global elite , most notably in regard to the IMF and the World Bank .
Between 2000 and 2004 , Putin persistently refused to borrow from these institutions .
Now that the banksters and neolibs have managed to knock Russia and other oil - producing nations down a few notches — due largely to artificially induced falling oil prices — it is time for them to strike a new deal with Russia as the New World Order scheme gains momentum .
Thus it is fair to say Kissinger ’s meeting with Medvedev and Putin had less to do with nuclear stockpiles than it had to do with offering a deal the Russians may not be able to refuse .
In short , Kissinger ’s trip was likely what it appears to be — a meeting between mob bosses as they set about to carve up their respective spheres of influence .

BEIJING , China ( CNN ) --
A monk carrying a Tibetan national flag and shouting slogans set himself on fire in south - central China on Friday and then was shot at by police , a human rights group reported .
Tibetans in exile in India mark the new year and protest against Chinese rule .
Police fired three shots at the monk , but it was not known if any hit him or whether he survived , said Matt Whitticase , spokesman for the London - based Free Tibet organization .
Whitticase said he based his report on eyewitness accounts .
The Chinese foreign ministry told CNN it could not offer comment on the incident because it is a " domestic issue , " while the Chinese state media reported that police had put out the flames and taken the man to hospital .
About 40 minutes before the shooting , around 1,000 monks trying to observe the Monlam Festival had gathered at Kirti Monastery in Aba County , Sichuan Province , said Whitticase .
Some of the worst unrest during Tibetan protests in March 2008 occurred in the same area .
The monks had approached the gates of a prayer hall in defiance of an order by authorities that barred them from observing the Monlam Festival , which is part of the Tibetan new year .
They were prevented from entering the prayer hall and told to go back to their rooms , which they did .
A monk , identified as being in his 20s and going by the single name of Tabe , left the monastery a while later and walked the short distance into town , shouting slogans and holding a self - drawn Tibetan national flag above his head , Whitticase said .
The flag contained a picture of the Dalai Lama , the spiritual leader of Tibet .
When the monk arrived in town , he doused himself with fuel and set himself on fire , Whitticase said .
The monk was immediately surrounded by armed police , who were not able to get near him because of the flames .
Eyewitnesses said the police leveled guns at the monk and fired three shots .
The monk collapsed to the ground , the Free Tibet spokesman said .
After police extinguished the flames , the monk was placed in a van and driven away to an undisclosed location , the witnesses said .
Xinhua , the Chinese state news agency , reported a local official as saying that the man had been taken to a local hospital immediately after police extinguished the flames .
Shi Jun , secretary of the Aba Tibetan - Qiang Autonomous Prefecture committee of the Communist Party of China , told the agency : " The man suffered burn injuries on his neck and head . "
The agency added that the incident is now being investigated .
London 's Daily Telegraph newspaper noted that Tibetan exile groups said last year that police shot and killed a handful of protesters in Aba County .
The campaigners released graphic photographs of bodies and the names of five alleged victims .
Chinese state media said police wounded " rioters " in self - defense , the newspaper said .
China rejects Tibetan claims of independence or greater autonomy and claims sovereignty over the area .

' Tan Jabs ' - Because Some People Are Just That Stupid
Increasing numbers are risking their health just because they want to have a tan , say researchers in an editorial published on bmj.com today .
The authors , led by Michael Evans - Brown from Liverpool John Moores University , argue that while the actual number of people having ' tan jabs ' ( the drugs Melanotan I and Melanotan II ) is unknown , they are easily available via the internet and in some tanning salons and hairdressers .
A thriving online community of users exist , the largest of which is Melanotan.org with over 5,000 members .
Evans - Brown fears that people using the ' tan jab ' are putting their health at risk .
" Serious concerns exist about the quality of the preparations that are currently available – not only the drug content and dose , but also contaminants and sterility .
Some users , especially those who are injecting drugs for the first time , are reusing or sharing injecting equipment , which places them and others at risk of infections , including blood borne viruses . "
While small clinical trials have so far only linked melanotans to facial flushing , nausea and vomiting , one of the greatest concerns , say the authors , is that the drugs may interact with how the body functions , especially given that people who want to maintain a tan will be using it for a long time .
There are two types of Melanotan that are likely to be used more and more by the general population , says the editorial .
Both melanotan I and melanotan II tan the skin , with melanotan II also causing penile erections and increases in sexual desire .
The authors argue that health professionals need to respond to this growing trend by warning patients about the dangers of using illicitly supplied drugs as well as reporting any adverse reactions .
In conclusion , Evans - Brown says that this issue will not go away given that society 's appetite for drugs for lifestyle reasons appears to be " insatiable . "
A couple of months ago , PR industry heavyweight ( and one of my business inspirations )
Todd Defren wrote about how he does n't hesitate to engage in corporate espionage , as long as it's ethical .

We were long told that the grueling accounts of torture , sexual abuse , and mental terror inflicted under orders from president Bush in Guantanamo Bay ( and many other sites in the war on Jihadist terrorism ) were lies .
The testimony came from Jihadists , after all .
The testimony of a man like Binyam Mohamed , who may be released this week to Britain , could not be trusted .
But then came the testimony from FBI agents who saw the barbarism authorized in the camp ; and increasingly , more and more US servicemembers have come forward to testify to rigged trials , orchestrated sadism , instrumental rape as policy and abuse of medical ethics .
Here 's the latest - 15,000 words from Army Private Brandon Neely .
Some flavor of Standard Operating Procedure :
The prisoners arrived in orange suits .
Some had orange ski caps .
They had goggles on their eyes , earmuffs on their ears , surgical masks on their faces , and black gloves on their arms .
They were handcuffed and leg - shackled .
They had chains around their waists with a padlock on the back .
The handcuffs were attached to the waist chain .
This is classic sensory deprivation apparatus , designed to break down a person 's mental stability .
Prisoners who in any way resisted force - feeding or offered any kind of resistance were IRFed , an over - powering method that soon became a routine form of abuse :
I do n't believe the IRF team was used for the right reasons at all .
At least the people on the team used it for the wrong reasons .
It was their way to beat up on someone who was smaller and weaker than them .
I have often wondered why you would need 5 healthy , grown men , in riot gear , to go take a down a detainee who was most likely underweight and very weak .
You could always tell when someone got IRFed , as the detainees throughout the camp would start chanting and screaming .
So I could tell when the detainee on Alpha Block was IRFed that day .
By the time the IRF team was coming off the block and I was walking back towards Alpha Block I noticed a couple of the guys had blood on their arms , hands , and uniforms .
They were washing their hands with water .
The detainee was escorted off the block to medical , where he was given stitches for multiple lacerations to his head .
Later that day I came back on the block and saw the cage this detainee was IRFed in .
The cement floor was a dull red color from the blood .
You could tell at one point before it was washed out that there was a lot of blood on the floor of that cage .

Coming out tonight …
In an exit interview with PBS ’s Jim Lehrer on the NewsHour airing tonight , Vice President Cheney repeats claims that Saddam Hussein worked with al - Qaeda .
Asked if he made any mistakes in his eight years as V.P. , Cheney only mentions underestimating the psychological harm Saddam had done to his own people .
He said his administration bore no blame for the economic problem and the terror threat was inherited because of the poor handling by previous presidents .
And he shrugged off a statement today by a key figure , who used to work under him , calling the handling of one terror suspect out - and - out “ torture . ”
( Recasts with added detail on criticism of capital injection )
WASHINGTON , Feb 5 ( Reuters ) - The U.S. Treasury looks to have overpaid financial institutions to the tune of $ 78 billion in carrying out capital injections last year , the head of a congressional oversight panel for the government ’s $ 700 billion bailout program told lawmakers on Thursday .
Elizabeth Warren , a Harvard law professor , said her group estimated the Treasury paid $ 254 billion in 2008 in return for stocks and warrants worth about $ 176 billion under the Troubled Asset Relief Program , or TARP .
Warren said the Treasury , under then - Secretary Henry Paulson , misled the public about how it would price them .
“ Treasury simply did not do what it said it was doing ...
They described the program one way , and they priced it another , ” Warren said at a hearing before the Senate Banking Committee .
She added that Paulson “ was not entirely candid ” in describing TARP ’s bank capital injection program .
Members of the committee condemned management of the TARP program , which is barely four months old .
“ Implementation ... proceeded in a chaotic , unorganized and ad hoc manner , ” said Democratic Sen. Daniel Akaka of Hawaii .
Warren said Treasury may have had a reason for paying more for investments than they appear to have been worth at the time of the transaction .
“ Once again , Treasury needs clear goals , methods , and measurement , ” she said .
Warren will release a report Friday on TARP .
Neil Barofsky , another watchdog for the TARP program , told the Senate committee his office is turning to criminal investigations .
“ That ’s going to be a large focus of my office , ” he said .
Barofsky , the inspector general for TARP within Treasury , told the Los Angeles Times in an interview Wednesday that misrepresentations in applications for TARP funds would be grounds for criminal prosecution .
OVERHAULING TARP
The Obama administration plans to unveil a new strategy on Monday aimed at reviving paralyzed credit markets , helping struggling homeowners , and lifting the economy out of recession .
Tighter TARP management is expected to be a part of that package .
A preview of that came on Wednesday when the White House announced a $ 500,000 annual cap on executive pay at companies receiving TARP money .
On projections by some analysts that the TARP program may need more money soon , Indiana Democratic Sen .
Evan Bayh said , “ There will be no additional funding for this program without airtight assurances that it will be better managed . ”
The TARP was launched last year by the Bush administration in response to an alarming slowdown in global capital markets triggered by a housing slump that undermined mortgage - backed bonds carried on the books of major financial institutions .
Congress approved the $ 700 billion program after Paulson said it would be used to buy broken bonds and clean off banks ’ balance sheets .
But days after that approval , Paulson changed the focus to buying preferred shares in banks .
Warren told the banking committee that after three months on the job , her panel is still not getting enough answers from Treasury .
She described the bailout as “ an opaque process at best . ”
Barofsky raised concerns about potential fraud in one of several programs funded by bailout money -- the Federal Reserve ’s Term Asset - Backed Loan Facility ( TALF ) .
“ Treasury should consider requiring that some baseline fraud prevention standards be imposed , ” Barofsky said in his first report to Congress .
He told the committee the government has collected more than $ 271 million in dividends from its TARP - financed bank shares and said the department needs a strategy for administering its holdings .
A Treasury spokesman said the department would adopt many of Barofsky ’s recommendations .
Treasury holds $ 279.2 billion in preferred shares from 319 financial institutions , paying dividends of between 5 and 10 percent , according to Barofsky ’s report .
The government also received common stock warrants from 230 institutions , most of which are now out of the money .
The largest positions in warrants include AIG AIG.N , Bank of America BAC.N , Citigroup C.N and General Motors GM.N .
Yet another watchdog group -- Congress ’s Government Accountability Office -- told the committee Treasury needs to keep closer track of TARP money disbursed and that the program needs internal controls and “ a clearly articulated vision . ”
Barofsky 's report was posted on the Webhere .

Strange , is n't it , that the biggest , most ambitious , most expensive clean energy project in the world , a zero- carbon , zero - waste new city called Masdar City , is going up in the oil - rich Abu Dhabi ?
Then again , maybe it 's not so strange .
There are good reasons why the royal family that runs Abu Dhabi , the largest of the seven emirates that make up the United Arab Emirates , and home to an estimated 9.2 % (! ) of the world 's proven oil reserves , is so committed to solar energy , zero waste , super - efficient buildings , sustainable materials , personalized electric transport and other clean tech innovations :
1 . They know that energy is the biggest business in the world .
2 . They know oil supplies are limited .
3 . They understand the threat of climate change .
4 . They have more money than they can spend .
5 . And they run the country without opposition , so if they want to get something bold and risky done , like building a new city for 50,000 people , they get it done .
There are no NIMBY ( not - in - my - backyard ) problems at Masdar , although that 's also because there are no backyards anywhere near Masdar .
It 's being built in a desert , outside the city of Abu Dhabi .
I 've been reading and writing about Masdar for a year or so , and today I finally had a chance to see it .
This week , I 'm visiting Abu Dhabi for the World Future Energy Summit , a meeting of about 3,000 people to discuss clean energy .
The conference is attracting business people and political leaders from around the world .
( Speakers include Tony Blair , Lord Nicholas Stern , Nobel prize winner Dr. Rajendra Pachauri and Susan Hockfield , the president of MIT . )
Disclosure : The Masdar Initiative , the parent company of Masdar City , paid my expenses to attend .
Today , Masdar took about 50 reporters on a tour of Masdar City , which is still in its early stages .
Currently under construction are a headquarters building , and a couple of buildings that will be part of the Masdar Institute , a research - oriented graduate school being developed in cooperation with MIT .
The institute is expected to open later this year , with about 250 faculty and staff and about 150 students .
Because Masdar wants to attract top students from around the world , those admitted will get free tuition .
There 's lots more about the city at the Masdar website .
The most impressive thing we saw today was a solar energy power plant , consisting of an array of solar photovoltaic panels , spread across a 55 - acre site .
When construction is completed in March , the solar facility will have 87,777 panels and be able to generate 10 megawatts of electricity — making it the largest solar power plant in the Middle East and North Africa .
That 's still not very big .
By comparison , a typical coal plant can generate about 700 megawatts .
The solar plant is being designed and built by an Abu Dhabi - based startup called Enviromena Power Systems , whose CEO , Sami Khoreibi , told me that he started the company explicitly to take advantage of opportunities being created by Masdar .
" We hope to use this project as a launching pad , " Khoreibi said , noting that the abundant sunshine in the Middle East make it a perfect site for solar power .
The 10 Mw plant cost about 185 million dirhams , the local currency , or about $ 50 million dollars .
Interestingly , Masdar has been conducting field tests since 2007 of solar photovoltaic panels — 33 systems from 15 countries .
The purpose is to measure their performance against cost under challenging , real - world conditions .
( Summers here feature sweltering heat . )
" We 're testing and constantly analyzing the data , and using it for our procurement process , " said Dr. Samir Tabu Zaid , a Masdar executive who responsible for solar .
Here he is , snapped with my iPhone :
The test results wo n't be made public , Zaid said , because some companies that supplied panels did not want to be measured against their peers .
He would n't even say which companies were competing , although he said they come from the U.S. China , Japan , Taiwan , Spanish and Germany , among other places .
But we know that two companies did very well because their panels were chosen for the first 10 MW solar plant .
One is Suntech , the big Chinese company that makes conventional silicon crystalline solar panels , and the other is First Solar , a U.S. manufacturer that makes thin film solar in , among other places , Toledo , Ohio .
The Walton family of Wal - Mart fame were among the early investors in First Solar .
Each is supplying 5 MW of solar .
Eventually , solar photovoltaic power is expected to deliver about 80 % of the electricity to Masdar .
The city will need 200 to 250 MW .
First Solar is n't the only U.S. company that wants to profit from Masdar .
Applied Materials , of Santa Clara , CA , is supplying machinery for a solar PV manufacturing plant that Masdar is building in Germany .
CH2MHill , the Colorado - based U.S. construction and engineering firm , is project manager for Masdar City .
CH2MHill 's CEO , Ralph Peterson , is speaking here .
( He 's also agreed to speak at FORTUNE 's Brainstorm Green conference . )
A big question : Will the Masdar Initiative make money , and , if so , how ?
If the city is a success , it will attract businesses and other tenants , but the upfront costs – an estimated $ 22 billion – do n't justify Masdar purely as a real estate development .
Longer term , the hope of Abu Dhabi and Masdar is to invent , develop and export clean technology .
As Khaled Awad , director of property development at Masdar , put it today : " This city is supposed to be a destination for innovation . "
Query why this can't be happening in Silicon Valley or Washington , D.C. , but in a flat world , we 'll all benefit from the work unfolding here .
Banks have kept most of last month 's Bank of England 's base rate cut for themselves , research for the Independent shows today .
An analysis of more than 1,000 current mortgage deals shows that rather than pass on the 1 per cent cut lenders have trimmed the average fixed rate deal by just .14 per cent , from 5.76 to 5.62 per cent .
Tracker mortgages have become more expensive since the Bank of England 's measure on December 4 .
The average loading on capped rates has increased from 2.35 per cent to 2.6 per cent above base rate - up .25 per cent .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Someone taking out a typical tracker for a £ 200,000 mortgage will pay £ 40 a month more , when the base rate cut should have reduce payments by £ 160 a month .
The analysis by Defaqto financial experts shows that many of Britain 's 11.7 m mortgage holders will find that they do not benefit much if at all from the Bank of England 's rate cuts when they come to re-mortgage .
Home - buyers seeking to enter the property market will find it more expensive to borrow money , putting further downward pressure on plummeting house prices .
The Bank of England cut the base rate by half a per cent today to 1.5 per cent - its lowest level for more than 300 years in an attempt to stave off a severe recession .
Policymakers hope banks and building societies will pass on the cut in full to homeowners , putting more money into the economy .
However David Black , principal banking consultant at Defaqto , said the analysis showed many banks were seeking to rebuild their crippled balance sheets at the expense of borrowers .
This week , First Direct has increased its offset base rate tracker from 3.49 to 3.89 per cent - an increase in the margin over base rate from 1.49 per cent to 1.89 per cent .
HSBC has increased its base rate tracker margin from 1.64 per cent to 1.95 per cent .
Many lenders have failed to change their standard variable rate at all after December 's 1 per cent cut - including GMAC - RFC and Norwich & Peterborough and West Bromwich building societies .
Leeds building society has cut its rate by less than half a per cent .
Mr Black expected many landers would take tracker mortgages off the market today and replace them with more expensive products in order to boost margins , rather than see existing products follow rates down .
Half of British borrowers are on fixed rates , 40 per cent on tracker or discounted variable rates and less than 8 per cent on standard variable rates .
The Council of Mortgage Lenders warned borrowers not on trackers that banks were unlikely to lower rates much further regardless of how low the base rate fell .
" Many borrowers on tracker rates are likely to benefit from a reduction in Bank rate .
However , as the Bank rate is already very low , some trackers will be reaching their floors , " the CML said .
" Those borrowers will still be paying very low rates historically ; the average mortgage rate over the last 10 years has been 5.84 per cent , " the CML said .
" Borrowers with standard variable rate mortgages should not expect a cut in Bank rate to be matched by an equivalent reduction in their mortgage rate , as there will not be an instant equivalent reduction in the cost of funds to lenders . "
The CML said that banks were trying to rebuild their balance sheets as well as be fair to savers and borrowers .
However Which ?
chief executive , Peter Vicary - Smith , said the banks must treat savers and borrowers equally - rather than just cutting savings rates and not mortgages .
" Banks can't have their cake and eat it – they must either maintain rates for savers or pass on the full benefits of the rate cut to their mortgage customers , " Mr Vicary - Smith said .
" Many banks are offering rates as low as 0.1 per cent on savings accounts so for them to say they are looking out for savers by not passing the rate cut onto borrowers is a hollow argument .
" Individual consumers did n't cause the financial crisis and should n't be the ones to suffer as the banks try to recapitalise their businesses . "
Scientists at Tufts University have patented a shock absorber that converts compressive energy into electricity , which can then be stored in a hybrid vehicle 's batteries .
Called the Power - Generating Shock Absorber ( PGSA ) , actually an electromagnetic linear generator , it uses " magnet arrays , high magnetic permeability spaces , coil winding arrays , " and a linear electric motor to capture the energy of its motion and use it to charge the batteries .
The movement of a standard shock absorber creates heat , which is neutralized by the oil in the shock .
In a PGSA , a linear electric motor converts the magnetic field created by the repetitive motion into electricity .
Or , if you like your technology to sound science -y , it " uses an electromagnetic linear generator to convert variable frequency , repetitive intermittent linear displacement motion to useful electrical power .
"
The technology can be used on any vehicle that uses shocks and batteries , but its greatest application could be on trucks due to their higher mass and electricity - generation potential .
Electric Truck , LLC has licensed the shock technology , which is predicted to generate between 2 kW and 17 kW of energy on an average road .
According to the men who created it , " the percentage of recoverable power / energy for a 2,500 lb vehicle that employs four optimized design regenerative magnetic shock absorbers and whose average speed is 45 mph on a typical US highway is likely to be between 20 % and 70 % . "
Put four of those on a Prius and stay in town , and all of a sudden you 're talking about interstellar gas mileage .

Sea Shepherd announced today that they have decided to give up their Operation Musashi campaign against the Japanese whaling fleet for this season , citing the whalers ’ increasingly violent and dangerous tactics in the Antarctic .
“ I have said always said that we would do everything we can short of hurting people to end illegal whaling in the Antarctic Whale Sanctuary , ” said Captain Paul Watson .
“ Although we are willing to take the risks required , even to our own lives , I am not prepared to do to the Japanese whalers what they do to the whales and the escalating violence by the whalers will result in some serious injuries and possibly fatalities if this confrontation continues to escalate . ”
[ social_buttons ]
Watson still called the campaign a success because his organization prevented the Japanese from hunting whales for nearly a month and a half .
However , three Sea Shepherd crew members inquired injuries from Japanese attacks , mostly stemming from their surprising use of long - range acoustic device weaponry .
The campaign was halted only four days early , but at the rate that confrontations were escalating , Watson said it was no longer worth the risk .
The Steve Irwin faced an tough challenge against three harpoon ships the last few weeks .
Sea Shepherd collided with Japanese ships on two occasions , one of which was documented by the whalers and spread across the internet .
Watson dismissed claims that he intentionally rammed the Japanese ships .
“ The whalers and their hired PR flunkies can say whatever they want now but we have over 1,000 hours of video footage documenting every moment of the campaign .
Our story will be told on a weekly series on Animal Planet with the show Whale Wars .
People can watch and judge for themselves .
The camera is the most powerful weapon in the world and we intend to demonstrate that power . ”
Apparently Japan also realizes the damage that the Whale Wars footage had on their image : Sea Shepherd has received word that Japan dispatched a ship called the Taiyo Maru # 38 from Fiji last week with orders to find , board , and capture the Steve Irwin vessel and all video footage on board .
Perhaps this could have had a hand in Watson ’s decision to abort the campaign early ?

For two decades as a Bob Evans waitress , Ms. Baker relied on a busboy to clear syrup - plastered dishes and wipe biscuit crumbs from her tabletops .
But with restaurants in a sharp downturn amid the recession , Bob Evans is among a growing number of full - service eateries that are eliminating busboys to cut costs .
Instead , servers are primarily responsible for clearing their tables .

Shawn Peters , the author of three books on religion and the law , including “ When Prayer Fails : Faith Healing , Children and the Law ” ( Oxford , 2007 ) , said the outcome of the Neumann case was likely to set an important precedent .
“ The laws around the country are pretty unsettled , ” said Mr. Peters , who teaches religion at the University of Wisconsin Oshkosh and has been consulted by prosecutors and defense lawyers in the case .
In the last year , two other sets of parents , both in Oregon , were criminally charged because they had not sought medical care for their children on the ground that to do so would have violated their belief in faith healing .
One couple were charged with manslaughter in the death of their 15 - month - old daughter , who died of pneumonia last March .
The other couple were charged with criminally negligent homicide in the death of their 16 - year - old son , who died from complications of a urinary tract infection that was severely painful and easily treatable .
“ Many types of abuses of children are motivated by rigid belief systems , ” including severe corporal punishment , said Ms. Swan , a former Christian Scientist whose 16 - month - old son , Matthew , died after she postponed taking him to a hospital for treatment of what proved to be meningitis .
“ We learned the hard way . ”
All states give social service authorities the right to go into homes and petition for the removal of children , Ms. Swan said , but cases involving medical care often go unnoticed until too late .
Parents who believe in faith healing , she said , may feel threatened by religious authorities who oppose medical treatment .
Recalling her own experience , she said , “ we knew that once we went to the doctor , we ’d be cut off from God . ”
The crux of the Neumanns ’ case , Mr. Peters said , will be whether the parents could have known the seriousness of their daughter ’s condition .

Investigators said the Neumanns last took Kara to a doctor when she was 3 .
According to a police report , the girl had lost the strength to speak the day before she died .
“ Kara laid down and was unable to move her mouth , ” the report said , “ and merely made moaning noises and moved her eyes back and forth . ”
Despite all our efforts to make every software development project a success , some are cursed from the very start .
Here are 26 early warning signs — all , alas , real - world experiences — that an enterprise software development project is headed for a death march .
The project name changes for the third time in as many months .
The development manager decides that it is better to write a completely separate version of the software for the U.K. rather than to internationalize a single version .
The requirements definition is begun four months after development started .
The newly hired director of R&D proudly informs the board of directors that the project will be 99 percent completed six months ahead of schedule , and assures the board that the software can ship directly to clients without going through beta testing .
You are a Web developer .
You open the ZIP file with the HTML documents the client produced for the site scripts you need to integrate with the Web application .
And you discover the client 's HTML documents are all Microsoft Word files , saved in HTML format .
You realize the reason the company hired you as a consultant is to referee a dispute among two competing departments over which technical platform to use .
The memo says you will develop a 64 - bit application using a 16 - bit platform .
The developer does n't understand the spec document and continues to develop anyway .
And the QA team does n't know how to test , but they " test " anyway .
When you see the project budget , you realize that over half of it was spent on a Web designer to create a Photoshop mock - up of the home page — with no regard to whether that design is feasible .
Or with any attention to the thousands of pages of content that will exist underneath that home page .
The user or client requests new features instead of focusing on bug fixing and performance enhancements .
You find a list of 16 software development best practices and realize that not a single one of them is being followed .
You are asked to port your project from Windows to MS - DOS .
The technical project manager asks you to compose the list of user requirements — without consulting any actual potential users .
People started sending notes " to file " rather than to each other .
The notes are alibis about why the sender has nothing to do with the upcoming ( but unacknowledged ) failure .
Status reports are seen as insubordinate .
The new CIO replaces all the people who have deep organizational knowledge with outsiders from his old firm .
It is a big project and is named Project Iceberg .
Or it 's the third time the company is trying to pull this off , and the project is code - named " Phoenix . "
Somehow , you do n't believe this one can spring from the ashes .
Even the customers who got the free version are pissed off .
The manager of your mission - critical project ( handling 80 percent of the company 's revenue ) has three months exposure to the technology of choice , and is training four brand - new developers at once .
The manager is given a three - month project deadline .
You learn that management had to insist that the interface definitions be checked into version control after the first code freeze .
They change the project manager and relocate the whole project from one city to another .
( You consider yourself lucky that the cities are on the same continent . )
The QA team is told , " We 've only allocated three weeks for testing " ( on a project that has lasted six months already ) .
Or QA is told , " The date is fixed .
We have to have all this functionality by that date . "
The program manager decided to try Agile methodology " to save time . "
In a previous era , pre-cell - phones and ubiquitous Internet access :
You get screeching abuse from a new project manager hired three days ago in New York , after you return from three days locked in regional CIO meetings in Frankfurt .
Why ?
Because you had n't responded to the e-mail messages she had sent ( and which you did n't get ) , and you had n't updated her " project dashboard " that you knew nothing about .
Management decides to spend a million dollars on a $ 20,000 project .
Then the managers start agreeing with computer company salespeople that the $ 1 million in software requires $ 2 million of hardware .
Meanwhile , a secretary purchases an off - the - shelf PC and a shrink wrapped CD containing some new office automation packages .
She implements the project during her lunch break .
( Arguably , we should count this one as a success . )
The lead developer tells you that maintaining a complete history of all database updates is a requirement for the application , but he has n't had time to ( read : does n't know how to ) design a data model for it yet .
So he decides to go ahead and start with the Web front end and worry about it later .
And this is the lead developer .
I ’m not sure why they are having a sale on Xbox LIVE Gold cards , but I do n’t think anyone would mind .
12 months ( +1 extra for free ) is now only $ 29.99 from the regular $ 49.99 .
The sale will only last until February 28th , so go get it before it ’s too late !

Laser scanning was used to plot the exact dimensions of the prints
The earliest footprints showing evidence of modern human foot anatomy and gait have been unearthed in Kenya .
The 1.5 - million - year - old footprints display signs of a pronounced arch and short , aligned toes , in contrast to older footprints .
The size and spacing of the Kenyan markings - attributed to Homo erectus - reflect the height , weight , and walking style of modern humans .
The findings have been published in the journal Science .
The footprints are not the oldest belonging to a member of the human lineage .
That title belongs to the 3.7 million - year - old Australopithecus afarensis prints found in Laetoli , Tanzania , in 1978 .
Those prints , however , showed comparatively flat feet and a significantly higher angle between the big toe and the other toes , representative of a foot still adapted to grasping .
Exactly how that more ape - like foot developed into its modern version has remained unclear .
The fossil record is distinctly lacking in foot and hand bones , according to lead author Matthew Bennett of Bournemouth University , UK .
" The reason is that carnivores like to eat hands and feet , " Professor Bennett told BBC News .
" Once the flesh is gone there 's a lot of little bones that do n't get preserved , so we know very little about the evolution of hands and feet on our ancestors . "
The footprints were found near Ileret in northern Kenya .
The site , on a small hill , is made up of metres of sediment which the researchers carefully cleared away .
What they found was two sets of footprints , one five metres deeper than the other , separated by sand , silt , and volcanic ash .
The team dated the surrounding sediment by comparing it with well - known radioisotope - dated samples from the region , finding that the two layers of prints were made at least 10,000 years apart .
Another critical feature that the series of footprints makes clear is how Homo erectus walked .
There is evidence of a heavy landing on the heel with weight transferred along the outer edge of the foot , progressing to the ball of the foot and lifting off with the toes .
" That 's very diagnostic of the modern style of walking , and the Laetoli prints do n't give that same character , " Professor Bennett said .
The finding is a critical clue for mapping out the evolution of modern humans , both in terms of physiology and also how H. erectus fared in its environment .
H. erectus was a great leap in evolution , showing increased variety of diet and of habitat , and was the first Homo species to make the journey out of Africa .
" There 's some suggestion out there that Homo erectus was able to scour the landscape for carcasses and meat ... and was able to get there very quickly , had longer limbs and was much more efficient in terms of long distance travel , " Professor Bennett added .
" Now we 're also saying it had an essentially modern foot anatomy and function , which also adds to that story . "

Ms. Afary says that mandatory premarital programs to teach about sex and birth control , instituted in 1993 to control population growth , helped women delay pregnancy and changed their views toward marriage .
By the late 1990s , she says , young people were looking for psychological and social compatibility and mutual intimacy in marriage .
Despite the gains they have made , women still face extraordinary obstacles .
Girls can legally be forced into marriage at the age of 13 .
Men have the right to divorce their wives whenever they wish , and are granted custody of any children over the age of 7 .
Men can ban their wives from working outside the home , and can engage in polygamy .
By law , women may inherit from their parents only half the shares of their brothers .
Their court testimony is worth half that of a man .
Although the state has taken steps to discourage stoning , it remains in the penal code as the punishment for women who commit adultery .
A woman who refuses to cover her hair faces jail and up to 80 lashes .
Women also face fierce resistance when they organize to change the law .
The Campaign for One Million Signatures was founded in 2005 , inspired by a movement in Morocco that led to a loosening of misogynist laws .
The idea was to collect one million signatures for a petition calling on authorities to give women more equal footing in the laws on marriage , divorce , adultery and polygamy .
But Iran ’s government has come down hard on the group , charging many of its founders with trying to overthrow it ; 47 members have been jailed so far , including 3 who were arrested late last month .
Many still face charges , and six members are forbidden to leave the country .
One member , Alieh Eghdamdoust , began a three - year jail sentence last month for participating in a women ’s demonstration in 2006 .
The group ’s Web site , www.we-change.org, has been blocked by the authorities 18 times .
“ We feel we achieved a great deal even though we are faced with security charges , ” said Sussan Tahmasebi , one of the founding members of the campaign , who is now forbidden to leave Iran .
“ No one is accusing us of talking against Islam .
No one is afraid to talk about more rights for women anymore .
This is a big achievement . ”
Women ’s advocates say that the differences between religious and secular women have narrowed and that both now chafe at the legal discrimination against women .
Zahra Eshraghi , for example , the granddaughter of the revolutionary leader , Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini , signed the One Million Signatures petition .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The United States on Tuesday denied that a telephone call from Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert to President George W. Bush forced Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to abstain in a U.N. vote on the Gaza war .
“ Some of what we ’ve seen is not accurate , ” White House spokesman Tony Fratto said .
“ There are inaccuracies , ” he said about Olmert ’s remarks Monday night in a speech broadcast on Israeli television and widely reported in the media .
Olmert said he had demanded to talk to Bush with only 10 minutes to spare before a U.N. Security Council vote on a resolution opposed by Israel calling for an immediate ceasefire .
“ He gave an order to the secretary of state and she did not vote in favor of it -- a resolution she cooked up , phrased , organized and maneuvered for .
She was left pretty shamed and abstained on a resolution she arranged , ” Olmert said .
State Department spokesman Sean McCormack , who was with Rice at the United Nations last week during debate on the U.N. resolution , said the remarks were “ just 100 percent , totally , completely untrue . ”
McCormack added that Washington had no plan at the moment to seek clarification from Israel .
In his speech , Olmert described his call to Bush while the U.S. president was giving a speech in Philadelphia .
“ I said , ‘ I do n’t care .
I have to talk to him now , ’ ” Olmert said , describing Bush , who leaves office on January 20 , as “ an unparalleled friend ” of Israel .
“ They got him off the podium , brought him to another room and I spoke to him .
I told him , ‘ You ca n’t vote in favor of this resolution . ’
He said , ‘ Listen , I do n’t know about it , I did n’t see it , I ’m not familiar with the phrasing . ’ ”
Olmert said he then told Bush : “ ‘ I ’m familiar with it .
You ca n’t vote in favor . ’
Arab ministers said after the U.N. vote Thursday that Rice had promised them the United States would support the resolution , but then made an about - face after talking to Bush .
A few minutes before the scheduled vote at the United Nations , Rice ’s staff told reporters she would make a few brief comments beforehand , but then abruptly canceled her press appearance , saying she would instead speak to Bush by phone .
The vote was delayed while other ministers waited for Rice to finish the call .
She then entered the U.N. Security Council chamber , huddled with Arab ministers who shook their heads as she spoke to them .
Immediately after the vote , Rice left for Washington without talking to waiting reporters .
Rice joined her French and British ministers in drawing up the resolution and the three Western powers haggled with Arab countries for three days over wording , which Rice told the U.N. Security Council she supported .

CIUDAD JUAREZ , Mexico ( Reuters ) - Mexico is sending up to 5,000 new troops and federal police to the country ’s most violent city , where law and order is on the brink of collapse in a war between gangs supplying drugs to the United States .
The army said on Thursday the deployment could take the number of soldiers and federal police to over 7,000 in Ciudad Juarez , which is across the U.S. border from El Paso , Texas .
This month alone , drug hitmen killed 250 people in Juarez , where a meeting of cabinet members on Wednesday was rattled by three bomb scares , forcing soldiers to briefly shut the city ’s international airport .
“ In yesterday ’s meeting ( government officials ) talked about sending 5,000 troops and police to Ciudad Juarez , ” said army spokesman Enrique Torres .
“ They are expected to arrive in the next few weeks . ”
At the heavily guarded meeting on Wednesday , Interior Minister Fernando Gomez Mont had said the troop reinforcements would be “ notable ” but declined to give more details .
Torres said there were 2,020 troops and 425 federal police in Ciudad Juarez , a city of around 1.6 million people .
Drug trade analysts say Mexico ’s most - wanted fugitive , Joaquin “ Shorty ” Guzman , who leads a cartel from the Pacific state of Sinaloa , wants control of Ciudad Juarez , currently in the hands of local drug lord Vicente Carrillo Fuentes .
Law and order in Ciudad Juarez is close to collapse as Guzman ’s hitmen seek to destroy the Juarez cartel ’s entire operation , drug experts say , and kidnappings and extortions of business people are rampant .
In a what could be a new scare tactic by the gangs , a local newspaper received another anonymous bomb threat on Thursday .

Police evacuated El Heraldo newspaper in the state capital Chihuahua , south of Ciudad Juarez , after a man called the paper to warn of two bombs planted in the building .
It turned out to be a false threat .
“ It may have been another attempt by organized crime to spread fear or to distract the police , ” El Heraldo ’s news editor David Pinon told Reuters .

President Felipe Calderon has sent out some 45,000 troops across Mexico to try and crush drug gangs but clashes between rival cartels and security forces killed around 6,000 people last year .
The United States supports Calderon ’s military operation and is concerned the violence could destabilize Mexico , a key trading partner , and spill over the border .
A U.S. Senate committee said on Thursday it would discuss hold two meetings on the surging violence along the border , days after the Obama administration warned travelers about the growing risks there .
“ The recent escalation of violence along the southern border demands our immediate attention , ” said Senator Joseph Lieberman , chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee .
“ We must assess border security programs and plans in place and we must review the readiness of federal , state , and local law enforcement , ” he said .
The panel would examine how the two governments were addressing the situation and determine the potential for increased terrorist activity .
The committee said it may also look into whether there is merit to deploying National Guard to the border , fencing issues and potential mass migration from Mexico .
During the last couple of days , there has been a discussion in various places about JavaScript frameworks implementing Sizzle , the new CSS selector engine by John Resig , which is allegedly the fastest .
Resig wrote
Tom an email , saying that he would be pleased if MooTools joined the other frameworks by implementing Sizzle in its codebase , replacing our own selectors engine .
I do n't really know how many frameworks are actually thinking of using Sizzle in place of their own selectors code , as the only source I can find for this is Ajaxian .
Their information about Dojo was n't correct , so I 'm assuming that information about other frameworks is incorrect as well .
I do know that Dojo is considering including Sizzle as part of the Dojo foundation , based on an email Dylan Schiemann wrote to Aaron Newton .
As I understand it , Sizzle would become a Dojo Foundation project , with the ultimate goal of including it into Dojo Toolkit .
They have this idea of having the major framework developers all contribute to a unified CSS selector engine .
Now that you know the general picture , let me explain why this is a bad idea not only for MooTools , but for any framework other than Dojo and jQuery .
There are several reasons why a project like MooTools would never include a third party library like Sizzle in its codebase .
First of all , we already have a very fast , very manageable and solid CSS selector engine in place .
I worked on it a lot , I know how it works , and I know that if it ever needs a fix , every MooTools collaborator can just git it and fix it , right away .
Every Mootools collaborator knows how MooTools works , what our code practices are , and how to submit either a patch ( if they do n't have Git credentials ) , or patching the code themselves .
With Sizzle , I would have to submit a patch to the Dojo codebase , which would have to be passed through Dojo .
This leaves the possibility that the patch could be rejected , leaving us with a part of our library that does n't fit with our core philosophies .
It is largely a matter of code itself .
MooTools has its own very strict code rules and conventions .
For example , everyone working on MooTools knows that if they have to detect Explorer , they need to use Browser .
Engine . trident , everywhere .
If a developer does n't do that , he would probably be yelled at by myself .
By including a standalone library like Sizzle , we would be breaking our own rules .
MooTools does a great deal of work by abstracting common functionality and reusing these abstraction everywhere , for both ease of update and code readability .
By including a standalone library like Sizzle , we would be breaking this paradigm that has worked so well for us so far .
But most of all , we would be breaking the very essence of MooTools , being one single entity , perfectly balanced and in harmony with all of its parts .
Sizzle itself is well written , do n't get me wrong , but I honestly do n't think it 's any better that what we currently have .
First , Sizzle is a very big script in size compared to our selectors engine .
Second , it ( unintentionally ) highlights a shortcoming in SlickSpeed by caching every expression 's results .
John has a speed folder in his Sizzle GitHub repository , where he is comparing a selectors engine to real - world frameworks .
SlickSpeed runs every expression five times , recording the median result .
Since Sizzle caches the results , Sizzle results will always come out five times faster than anything else , assuming the code is as efficient as every other framework's .
Third , as some of you might already know , MooTools post - processes every node resulting from any query .
This tends to make things slower .
Sizzle however is a pure engine , therefore makes no post - processing at all .
This results in a very unfair comparison .
In an effort to test the true efficiency of our CSS selectors engines , I have made a modification to SlickSpeed , so that it runs every test only once , and a couple of modifications to the MooTools code .
This special testing version of MooTools no longer " extends " the resulting nodes ( I did that by simply adding a method that passes an optional parameter to the default function getElements , as I cannot pass parameters using SlickSpeed ) , and it uses querySelectorAll where available , just like Sizzle does .
This way we can have a true comparison between engines , instead of frameworks and engines .
Feel free to test my results in every browser available to you .
As you can see , the Sizzle engine is slower in many browsers .
Even assuming Sizzle were faster than MooTools in every test , it would be unwise to adopt it .
The Dojo Foundation and jQuery have it easy .
The Dojo people can just work on their own code repositories , where everyone knows what to do and how to contribute .
It 's basically the same thing for jQuery : Sizzle is copyrighted by John Resig .
He will always have a way to add / remove / modify whatever he pleases .
Us outsiders , however , wo n't have it as pretty .
We would have to gain the approval of the Sizzle project before making changes , limiting the power we have over our own codebase .
As with any project , there is always a chance that a patch that we submit wo n't be accepted .
In that case , we 're stuck with code we do n't like .
This centralization of code would create a dangerous precedent , eliminating competition in the marketplace and choices for developers who rely on frameworks .
Quoting Wikipedia :
[ A ] monopoly exists when a specific individual or enterprise has sufficient control over a particular product or service to determine significantly the terms on which other individuals shall have access to it .
It is often argued that monopolies tend to become less efficient and innovative over time , becoming " complacent giants " , because they do not have to be efficient or innovative to compete in the marketplace .
Sometimes this very loss of psychology efficiency can raise a potential competitor 's value enough to overcome market entry barriers , or provide incentive for research and investment into new alternatives .
I 'm not saying that John Resig seeks a monopoly over CSS selector engines , but that 's sure what it looks like .
Competition and innovation will stop if everyone uses the same piece of code .
Yes , competition and innovation .
Sooner or later , it will become too cumbersome trying to make Sizzle , or any other " shared component " fit our selfish , OCD - driven developer needs .
No sane contributor will be eager to take the extra steps to contribute to different parts of our libraries , and in the end we 'll have contributors completely ignoring the selector side of it .
Personally , I would never ever take my developers through the process of learning two different sets of project guidelines just because they want to contribute to the selector engine and make modifications .
As I 've said , MooTools developers know MooTools stuff .
That 's what MooTools is all about : MooTools stuff .
This is the way it should be for every other framework , otherwise , it 's kinda pointless having your own .
Unifying portions of frameworks would be the end of independent innovation , and we would become reliant on John and Dojo to make it better .
Or we could fork it , which would negate any proposed benefits , like having all developers of all frameworks work on a common piece of code .
If MooTools were allowed to submit any code which we wanted , we would have to assume that the same would be true of all other framework projects adopting Sizzle .
Without any serious form of control , it would soon become a monster script that fits nobody 's needs .
Citing a bold sentence in this Ajaxian article :
It 's very likely that Sizzle will eventually expand into other areas of JavaScript libraries ( such as DOM manipulation and event binding ) .
Let 's face it : every selector engine , every part of our libraries has benefited from the others .
Where they diverge is not an indicator of which framework is superior to another .
Rather , they are differences in philosophy .
If everyone were to use the same , shared codebase , these awesome open source contributions and general advancements will stop , and users would n't be able to choose the approach which works best for them .
I do n't want to see that happening .
The very reason we have many JavaScript frameworks is because we want to do the same things , differently .
Each one has its own way to code , its own way of solving problems .
By including something that 's not MooTools in MooTools , we would make MooTools be less MooTools ( and more jQuery , in this case ) .
So , if using one shared selector engine is ok , where do we draw the line ?
Is it ok to use a shared DOM manipulation library , or a shared event library ?
What makes our framework ours ?
If we start replacing core parts by outsourcing them to Dojo , our frameworks will just be a dull layer for code we did n't even write , and we will lose credibility .
Why use a layer when I can just use the real deal ?
Why would I use MooTools , if it 's just a layer for Dojo or jQuery code ?
Do n't even try and justify that it's not , because the code would be on Dojo servers , administered by Dojo foundation rules .
Its Dojo's .
We at MooTools prefer MooTools code , by MooTools coding standards and rules .
And I 'd be surprised if many frameworks are willing to give this all away for nothing .

Melbourne , February 7 , 2009 --
The heatwave across south - eastern Australia in recent weeks has given a hint of what we can expect as global temperatures continue to rise : black - outs , fatalities and transport chaos as privatised infrastructure fails .
Many are in mourning as bushfires have devastated rural Victoria , with the death toll passing triple figures and more than 750 homes destroyed .
The country town of Marysville has been erased from the map .
Several other towns have all but been destroyed .
Even before the bushfire catastrophe , South Australia and Victoria had seen a sharp increase in deaths as a result of the heatwave , with Adelaide ’s central morgue quite literally overflowing — the “ excess ” cadavers were stored temporarily in a refrigerated freight container .
Thousands of homes were left without electricity as demand soared , overwhelming the existing grid .
Melbourne ’s rail system collapsed into chaos as temperatures reached over 40°C .
University of Adelaide climate scientist Barry Brook put this tragedy into perspective on his blog on February 3 .
He pointed out that more people are thought to have died due to heat stress in the last week than died in the infamous Ash Wednesday bushfires in 1983 , which killed 75 .
This was before the bushfires that raged out of control in rural Victoria over the weekend of February 7 - 8 , now the worst ever in the state 's history .
Climate change
What do such once unusual and extreme weather events tell us about global warming ?
Climate scientists , activists and media sources like Green Left Weekly , among others , continue repeating that key climate tipping points are being crossed right now .
It ’s not something we will only have to think about in the future .
Urgent action is required immediately , because runaway climate change threatens life itself .
So can we say that climate change is at least partly responsible for those deaths ?
And do the politicians and corporate interests who are resisting sustainable change also bear some responsibility ?
What we can say with certainty is that the temperatures reached are exceedingly unlikely based on past meterological data .
Previous records tumbled across the south and south - east of the country .
The Australian Bureau of Meteorology released a report , Special Climate Statement 17 , on February 4 , which documented what it described as an “ exceptional heatwave ” .
Tasmania experienced seven of the eight highest temperatures on record ; Adelaide reached 45.7 C° , the third highest on record and had it ’s highest overnight minimum temperature of 33.9 °C ; Melbourne peaked at 45.1 °C , with the maximum temperature staying above 40 °C and minimums staying above 30 °C for three consecutive days — the first time this has happened since records were kept .
Extreme weather events have occurred in the past .
It simply is n’t possible to attribute any one unusual event to climate change .
But at the same time , the scientific evidence for global warming is conclusive , and the predictions of its impacts include a far greater number of intense heatwaves .
Brook argues that the likelihood that climate change is responsible for Adelaide ’s heatwave is very high .
He pointed out that 10 months ago Adelaide suffered another unprecedented heatwave — 15 days in a row with the maximum temperature exceeding 35°C .
He calculated the chances of Adelaide having two such extreme weather events so close together .
The odds are that it should occur just once every 1.2 million years .
Along with the heat - stress related deaths , the heatwave threw some of Australia ’s most inefficient , privatised infrastructure into disarray .
Transport meltdown
In Melbourne , the private rail operator Connex was already blaming the heat for train cancellations on January 18 , despite the temperature clocking in at a moderate 25°C .
Between January 28 and January 30 , more than 1000 trains were canceled ; including at one stage , all services on eight metropolitan lines .
On January 30 alone , 740 trains — a third of those scheduled — did not run , leaving thousands of commuters stranded for up to an hour and a half on scorching hot platforms .
Dr Paul Mees , a transport planning lecturer at RMIT ( Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology ) , told the 7.30 Report TV progam on January 29 that “ privatisation is the culprit .
We ’re becoming the international benchmark for failed privatisation of urban public transport systems . ”
Currently , Melbourne is the only capital city which has fully privatised it ’s metropolitan rail system .
The Victorian state government still maintains the network infrastructure .
Transport minister Lynne Kosky told the Victorian state parliament on February 5 , that the government spends $ 80 million a year on rail maintenance and that this would increase to $ 120 million by the end of 2009 .
But this public spending is dwarfed by the annual government subsidy of $ 345 million per year made out to Connex directly — more than half of the $ 589 million revenue Connex took in 2007 .
A 2006 report by urban planning academics titled Putting the public interest back into public transport , Victoria ’s privatised public transport system cost taxpayers $ 1.2 billion more than if it had remained state - owned .
So not only is it outrageous that people have to put up with regular delays and cancellations , but Melbourne ’s privatised transport is costing taxpayers more !
While the government has pointed the finger at the “ once- in - a- century ” heatwave as the sole cause of the problem , Connex executive chairperson Jonathan Metcalfe tried to shift the blame to train drivers in the Rail , Train and Bus Union .
In January , he accused drivers of causing up to 80 % of train cancellations by refusing to drive trains with no air - conditioning , broken locks and other “ minor ” faults .
But his attempted buck - passing has not stemmed growing public anger at his company .
In the 1920s , trains left Flinders Street Station , one of Melbourne ’s main stations , more frequently than they do today .
Public transport use in Melbourne has increased by 70 % in last 10 years , but there has been only a 9 % increase in services and hardly any new trains running in peak hours .
In fact , between 2002 and 2005 , Melbourne ’s excess trains were sold off for scrap despite increasing demand for public transport .
It is not just the public train system that is unable to cope with extreme heat ; during the heatwave hundreds of thousands of homes in Victoria and South Australia experienced blackouts as the electricity grid failed in numerous places and supply was shut off for up to an hour to cope with the demand .
Five hundred thousand homes in western Melbourne and regional Victoria were left without power following an explosion at an electrical substation .
The power - failures may also have contributed to the significant increase in heat - related deaths .
On February 3 , the Victorian state coroner announced that there had been almost two and a half times more deaths in the last week of January than the same time last year .
Jane Castle from the Total Environment Centre and one of the authors of the Rule Change Package , a proposal to reduce greenhouse emissions and electricity costs , has said the current energy system is hurting consumers and the environment Australia - wide .
“ Regulators plan to approve a $ 17 billion spending spree in NSW alone by networks bent on expanding the grid .
To pay for this , Energy Australia ’s customers in Sydney and Newcastle are facing increases in network prices of over 70 % ” , she said .
Stopping climate change
This raises the question of whether privately owned energy and transport infrastructure is compatible with the need to transform our economy along sustainable lines .
Can energy and transport be organised for profit and be sustainable ?
Should the companies who profit most from the status quo be allowed to dictate the pace of environmental change , as they do today ?
Increasingly , climate activists will need to confront these issues .
Such is the urgency required to deal with the climate emergency , that direct government intervention and investment will be necessary to make the transition possible .
If essential services remain in private hands , then profit , rather than the needs of people and planet , will continue to determine what decisions get made .
The huge amount of money that privitisation costs taxpayers would be better put towards expanding and improving public transport , and to start a rapid transition to renewable energy sources .
Even if emissions were slashed tomorrow , the science indicates that there will still be a high likelihood of temperature rises and significant changes to existing weather patterns .
If the existing systems ca n’t even cope with the conditions we are seeing now , then it can be assumed they will fail even more disastrously in the future — unless we can organise and pressure the government to act .

LOS ANGELES , Feb 22 ( Reuters ) - The Japanese movie “ Departures ” , about an out - of - work cellist who takes a job as an undertaker preparing corpses for cremation , was the surprise winner of the Oscar for best foreign language film on Sunday .
The movie was directed by Yojiro Takita and stars Masahiro Motoki as a musician who loses his job when his orchestra folds .
It was an upset win , after the Israeli animated documentary “ Waltz with Bashir ” was widely tipped to take the honor .
A second Japanese movie won an Oscar for best animated short film .
The award for best picture and a raft of other Oscars went to rags - to - riches romance “ Slumdog Millionaire , ” directed by Briton Danny Boyle .
[ ID :nN22321218 ]
In “ Departures ” , Motoki ’s unemployed character sells his expensive cello and moves with his wife to the snowy northern town where he grew up , in an attempt to start a new life .
Answering a mysterious job ad for someone to “ help with journeys ” lands him a post as an apprentice mortician , something he feels obliged to hide from his wife .
To his surprise , he discovers that he has an aptitude for the job , which teaches him about life and death .
“ Japanese people tend to avoid the topic of death and treat it as taboo , ” Takita told reporters .
“ I was uncertain and worried about how this movie would be released and whether people would accept it . ”
Unlike their counterparts in many countries , Japan ’s “ noukanshi ” morticians perform cleansing and beautifying services in the presence of the bereaved family , in a ritual that combines an atmosphere of sympathy and reverence with a magician ’s sleight of hand .
The initial idea for the film came from lead actor Motoki , but it took 10 years to reach fruition , becoming a labour of love for cast and staff who did not expect a box office hit , said Japan - based film critic Mark Schilling , an old friend of the director .
“ It ’s a great audience film , ” he said .
“ It ’s got comedy , it ’s got emotions .
It ’s dealing with something that everybody has to deal with , but in an unusual and interesting way . ”
Motoki spent months learning to play the cello and rehearsing funeral rites until he could perform them like a professional , while Takita also attended a number of funeral rituals to gain an understanding of how families react .
( For a Jan. 30 interview with the director , click [ ID:nT179956 ] )
“ Departures ” , already a hit in Japan , is scheduled for limited release in the United States in May , with screenings planned in nearly 30 other countries .
Another Japanese film , “ Tsumiki no Ie ” , or La Maison en Petits Cubes , won the Oscar for the best animated short film .
The 12 - minute film , directed by Kunio Kato , portrays the life of an old man who battles floods caused by global warming .

Responding to criticism over deaths of people who have been Tasered by police , the federal government has promised the United Nations Human Rights Council to " find an effective way to engage civil society " in the review process on the weapons .
It 's not clear how such public involvement would be carried out .
The pledge was contained in a first - ever review of Canada 's record on human rights , released yesterday in draft form by a working group of the Geneva - based organization .
There is no legal force to recommendations by the UN body – nor to promises by diplomats .
However , rights activists count on the " name and shame " publicity aspect of the newly implemented reviews by the 47 - nation council .
It 's the first time nations are reviewed on their record by their peers .
That means nations can be criticized by states whose own political leaders have shown disdain for human rights .
Canada , for example , took a pounding from Iran – assailed by international human rights groups for rights abuses – on several fronts , including treatment of " aboriginal women , migrants , Muslim , Arabs and Afro-Canadians . "
Still , much of the review consists of material provided in submissions to the working group by human rights and civil society organizations in Canada who present written reports for study by member nations .
They largely focused on treatment of aboriginal people that was termed " shameful , " from high suicide rates to missing and murdered women .
Canadian responses were usually general , with the specific promise on Tasers being an exception .
Among several countries to voice concern about the deaths of people who have been Tasered by police , Italy recommended Ottawa " prescribe more rigorous procedures for their possession and use . "
A Canadian official told the working group the use of Tasers is being widely studied in Canada and " a number of police forces and governments " are examining them .
The official further promised public engagement in the follow - up to ongoing review in Canada .
The Canadian delegation was headed by John Sims , deputy minister for Justice Canada , and included diplomats and officials from Indian and Northern Affairs and Foreign Affairs , among other departments .
According to Amnesty International , 25 people have died after being Tasered in Canada .
In B.C. , an inquiry is investigating the death of Robert Dziekanski , after he was shot with a Taser by the RCMP at the Vancouver airport in October 2007 .
The first part of the inquiry last year examined the use of Tasers by B.C. police .
Many countries among the 47 member states talked about extreme poverty among aboriginal people and the failure of the government to live up to treaty obligations .
As a result , several recommendations urged Canada to make changes in that area .
One recommendation calls for Canada to endorse the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples , a statement supported in draft form by the former Liberal government .
It passed in 2007 , with only Canada , New Zealand , Australia and the United States in opposition .
Norway expressed concerns about " the scale and character of violence against indigenous women " and advised the implementation of a national strategy in Canada to " respond to the severity of those issues . "
The United Kingdom said Canada should " give the highest priority to addressing these fundamental inequalities " between aboriginal people and other Canadians by , among others measures , settling land claims .
In the draft report , Canada acknowledged " wrongs in the past " on aboriginal issues .
" While the challenges are significant , there is progress on many fronts , including education , entrepreneurship , economic development , land claims and safe drinking water . "
Submissions were not limited to criticism .
Most nations included some form of praise for Canada , whether it was Ukraine noting the promotion of gender equality , or Jordan praising participation in the rights council itself .
Some nations expressed nostalgia for policies of Canada 's former Liberal government , bemoaning recent shifts under the Conservatives .
The working group yesterday published about 70 recommendations – some suggesting Canada merely " consider " an action .
The government 's response will be included in a future report .
Canada faces another review in four years .

Drew Barrymore Has Tongue Bling ( Video , Photos )
has been making the rounds while promoting her latest film , He 's Just Not That Into You .
At the L.A. premiere , she graced the red carpet and debuted a well kept secret ... her tongue piercing .
It seems Drew has always wanted to have some tongue bling and finally took the plunge last summer .
She reports that it did n't hurt much at first but the pain intensified afterward to the point where she could n't eat or drink for two weeks .
She proclaimed it a very effective " sick , sadistic and weird diet . "
The actress sat down with Ellen DeGeneres and chatted it up about the experience .
Ellen presented her with an assortment of tongue bling - see video below .
The downside of her new piercing is that it seems to be scaring the guys away .
She said , " I got it and then I 've been single ever since .
I did it for myself .
I always wanted to get one . "
We 've also got photos and video of Barrymore with Jessica Lange at the Golden Globes .
The two , who starred together in Grey Gardens , appear to be inseparable .
Is it just us or do they seem like more than just friends ?
In the second video , Barrymore says , " we fell in love " during the filming of the movie .
Check out photos and video below .

DAVOS , Switzerland ( CNN ) --
Tehran stood ready to work with U.S. President Barack Obama to establish better relations with Washington , Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki told a CNN - hosted panel at the World Economic Forum .
Iran 's Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki talks Thursday at the World Economic Forum in Davos .
Speaking during a debate on the foreign policy challenges facing the new president , Mottaki said Americans had talked enough .
" Now it is time for them to listen , " he urged .
" I believe the president of the United States needs more time to express his ideals and objectives , " Mottaki continued .
" I believe the U.S. should see why it needs to change .
These are strategic issues , not tactical measures .
" The U.S. needs to change because the world has changed drastically .
Therefore a new framework should be realistic .
President Obama has courage and he must tell us which aspects of the Bush administration he is against . "
In an earlier session at the five - day meeting of political and business leaders , Mottaki said that the U.S. would find " a creative and cooperative reaction , including from Iran " if it changed its policies in the Middle East .
Mottaki was speaking alongside Kenyan President Raila Odinga , senior ministers from France , Iraq and Afghanistan and Nobel peace laureate and nuclear weapons inspector Mohamed ElBaradei at a session hosted by CNN's Christiane Amanpour .
Panelists urged Obama to focus on the situation in the Middle East , the war in Afghanistan , the humanitarian crisis in Zimbabwe and nuclear proliferation .
Odinga welcomed the presidential election of the half - Kenyan Obama , saying " there is a lot of hope in the world right now . "
" Kenyans , like the rest of the world , have been electrified by the campaign and election of President Obama , " he said , calling on the new president to work with " progressive " African leaders .
" I belong to those who believe that Africa deserves better , " Odinga said .
" Because of poor leadership , Africa has not been able to claim its rightful place in the world . "
French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner rejected suggestions his country was anti-American , claiming , " We were never against America .
We just did not like certain American policies . "
He said Europe was ready to build a new partnership with the U.S. towards solving global problems .
He described Obama as a " man of conviction " who had " opened hearts and minds . "
Afghan Defense Minister Abdul Rahim Wardak called on Obama to make his conflict - stricken country a " focal point in the global war against terror , " but urged him to back up military force with investments in economic development and infrastructure .
Afghans had suffered in misery as the world prospered , despite having helped end the Cold War by " shattering the invincibility of the Red Army " in opposing the Soviet invasion of the 1980s , Wardak said .
" We need the support of the people , and making sure their lives are better under this government will bring a lasting victory , not just military operations , " said Wardak .
" The world is a global village ... and Afghanistan should never be allowed to become a failed state where the terrorists can hide and operate from . "
Calling for a change of regime in Zimbabwe , Kenya 's Odinga said the continent 's leaders had failed the southern African nation 's people , who are battling starvation and disease amid a power struggle between President Robert Mugabe and the opposition Movement for Democratic Change .
" African leaders have not had the courage to tell Mugabe that the time to leave has come , " Odinga said .
" The time to go is now . "
But Kouchner said telling Mugabe to quit would not suffice : " There is a very real reason to go in -- with medical forces , not an army ; a humanitarian intervention at least .
Mugabe is not ready to leave .
He is in good shape . "
ElBaradei , director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency , called on Obama to move toward a " legal commitment " to abolishing nuclear weapons and said he hoped for a " safer , saner and more human " world .
" Does it really make any sense that we still have 27,000 warheads in existence ? "
ElBaradei asked .
" Does it make sense that Russia and U.S. continue to deploy nuclear weapons against each other ? "
He said the new administration in Washington should be open to dialogue in addressing all international issues , adding that he had had " zero confidence " in previous efforts to isolate Tehran .
" Any time you try to isolate a country , the situation gets much much worse ...
Whether you like or dislike your enemy , you have to talk to them , " he said .
He also called on Iran to cooperate with IAEA inspectors over its nuclear program , which Tehran insists is intended solely for peaceful purposes .
Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari said Baghdad welcomed the " new direction " in Washington .
" We have all been very encouraged by the positive messages we are getting on Iraq and Palestine , " he said , adding that Iran was both " a neighbor and a friend . "
He said military commanders and the Iraqi government would decide when U.S. troops would withdraw from Iraq , and predicted the situation in Iraq would stabilize in coming months .
" This year Iraq will hold free elections and at the end of the year I hope you will see a different picture . "
The debate airs Saturday on CNN International .

The Employment minister Tony McNulty has admitted that he could not survive on the basic unemployment benefit paid to people made redundant .
As dole queues surged to a 10 - year high of 1.97 million , he acknowledged that it was " very , very difficult " to exist on jobseekers ' allowance ( JSA ) .
The benefit is worth £ 60.50 a week for people aged 25 and over , and £ 47.95 a week for younger claimants .
Mr McNulty is paid a salary of £ 104,050 – equivalent to £ 2,000 a week – as a minister of state .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
It takes him just over five hours to earn the equivalent of the weekly JSA payment .
His salary is dwarfed by the income of his wife , Christine Gilbert .
She was paid up to £ 230,000 last year as the chief inspector of education , children 's services and skills .
Mr McNulty 's admission came in a BBC Radio 5 Live interview when he was asked how he expected people to make ends meet on £ 60 a week .
He replied : " We just need to work with them to try and get them back into work at the earliest opportunity . "
Challenged about whether he could survive on that income , he conceded : " I do n't think I could .
I 'd be the first to say that . "
The minister added : " I think it 's very , very difficult and in most instances – not everybody – people will have other support from the state as well , through a range of other benefits . "
Brendan Barber , the TUC general secretary , said the comments proved the need for an increase in jobseekers ' allowance , adding : " Even government ministers admit they could n't live on today 's unemployment benefit of less than £ 10 a day – one of the lowest relative to wages in the developed world . "
Steve Webb , the Liberal Democrat work and pensions spokesman , said : " The minister is n't telling people on benefit anything they do n't already know .
What is appalling is that he does n't appear to want to do anything about it . "
The jobless total reached 1.97 million at the end of December .
It looks certain to pass two million next month following a spate of redundancies after Christmas , and business leaders forecast that three million people could be on the dole within a year .
The number of people claiming JSA stood last month at 1.23 million , a rise of 73,800 since December and the 12th consecutive increase .
The size of the workforce dropped last year by 66,000 to 29.4 million .
The number of UK - born workers in employment fell by 278,000 to 25.6 million , while non-UK - born workers increased by 214,000 to 3.8 million .

Theresa May , the shadow Work and Pensions Secretary , said : " These figures once again expose what a cynical piece of political spin the Prime Minister 's claim of ' British jobs for British workers ' was . "
Further job losses announced yesterday included 380 at the cash - and - carry retailer Makro , which is closing superstores in Coventry , Wolverhampton and Swansea , while 65 posts are being axed by the newspaper group News International .
The Governor of the Bank of England , Mervyn King , delivered a grim prediction over the length and severity of the downturn .
He warned Britain was in a " deep recession " and forecast a 4 per cent contraction in the economy between last summer and this summer .
That is far larger than previous projections .
Mr King also feared that repairing the impact of the credit crunch on bank lending " will not be easy and will take time " .
The Health Secretary , Alan Johnson , also suggests in an interview in The Spectator today that the downturn could last until the beginning of 2011 .
Contrasting the current economic slump with previous recessions , he told the magazine : " What happened in the Eighties and what happened to a certain extent in the Nineties is that whole areas , Hull for instance , were just left with no help at all .
" If we can get through this , a year , 18 months , even two years , with all the agencies focusing on how you give people skills to fill the vacancies , then you will have a completely different picture at the end of this than you did at the end of the Eighties . "
On a sunny morning when many Angelenos flocked to parks and beaches , Judy Riha hit a busy , noisy commercial stretch of La Cienega Boulevard on a hunt for illegal billboards .
She stopped every few feet Saturday -- nine times within a two - block stretch -- to count and take note of ads large and small selling cigarettes , energy drinks , movies and retirement plans .
“ They ’re holding the city hostage , ” she said , pointing to the ads , at the start of the 2 1/2 - mile stretch she was assigned to canvass as part of a neighborhood plan to curb the growing number of signs popping up in City Council District 10 .
The district includes Wilshire Vista , Mid-City and South Robertson .
The move comes as the city tries to grapple with complaints from residents and a host of legal challenges brought by billboard companies .

A three - month sign moratorium took effect Dec. 26 to give the city time to draft new laws regulating their quantity , size , location and brightness .
A two - year statewide moratorium targeting electronic billboards was proposed Friday in Sacramento .
In Los Angeles , signs without permits have continued to sprout despite the local ban , according to city lawyers .
Some billboard companies have argued that the city is violating their 1st Amendment right to free speech and favoring some companies over others .
One state legislator worries that limiting electronic billboards could worsen an already sagging economy .
The issue has turned residents like Riha , who works in the entertainment industry , into watchdogs as they fan out across corridors , creating a record of signs they see on poles , storefronts and high - rises .

With a clipboard in hand , she set out with about 20 residents to take inventory of billboards along Pico and Wilshire boulevards and other strips .
They wrote down sizes , addresses and identification numbers to submit to the city at the end of the month .
“ We ’re stepping out -- some with their partners , some with strollers -- and making a day out of it , ” she said , standing on the corner of Venice Boulevard and La Cienega with a 360 - degree view of eight billboards , some digitized .
“ People like us are going to save this city . ”
The event was organized by the Pico Neighborhood Council and the Coalition to Ban Billboard Blight .
“ We want the city to compare what we found against their database and figure out which ones are illegal , ” said Josh Pretsky , a resident of Faircrest Heights and coordinator of the event .

He said he expected residents to find about 600 signs .
It is unclear how many are illegal .
In a separate inventory in Council District 11 late last year , residents counted nearly 500 signs in areas including Brentwood and Pacific Palisades .
A 35 - year resident of the Fairfax area , Ron Smith , 69 , decided to get involved .
“ I ’ve started noticing more and more signs as I ’m driving , ” he said .
“ It can be blinding sometimes . ”

A new study published in theclaims that multivitamins are useless at preventing cancer and cardiovascular disease in women .
The mainstream media has predictably picked up on this story , gleefully running it as " proof " that nutrition is worthless and only pharmaceuticals can enhance your health .
What they 're not telling you , though , might shock you .
Here 's the truth about this so - called " scientific " study on multivitamins :
The women followed in this study were n't actually given any multivitamins at all .
They were simplyif they take multivitamins !
Since no multivitamins were given to women , there was no quality control at all .
Did these women take cheap , synthetic vitamins bought at Costco ?
Or did they take quality supplements from better sources ?
Nobody knows because it was n't tracked !
If you ask most people , they will TELL you they eat healthy , and that they take multivitamins .
But in reality they do n't .
Most people greatly exaggerate the description of their own health habits .
There was no ability of this study to reliably measure how often consumers actually took their multivitamins .
Did they take them once a week ?
Once a month ?
Once a year ?
Even taking them once a year would have counted in this study as " taking multivitamins . "
Gee , no wonder the results showed no improvement ...
In effect , .
What it really measured was the degree to which people exaggerate their own claims of health habits , and the degree to which the mainstream media so easily falls for junk science .
The MSM remains utterly clueless about nutrition , and it simply reprints practically any study published in a medical journal , even when that study is obviously based on deceptive science and a pro-Pharma agenda .
All these attacks on vitamin C , vitamin E , antioxidants and multivitamins have the same source : and its effort to try to discredit nutritional supplements in order to please advertisers .
The very idea that nutrition is bad for you but Big Pharma 's chemicals are good for you is insane to begin with .
But that 's what they want you to believe : Nutrition is n't required in the human body , they claim .
But pharmaceutical chemicals are essential !
What they want you to do is shut up , eat your ( processed ) food , take your ( chemical ) medications , get your ( fraudulent ) disease screening , pay your taxes , watch television ads , make more ( sheeple ) babies and stop questioning the status quo .
And multivitamins ?
Stop wasting your money on them .
You 'll need that money to buy more monopoly - priced pharmaceuticals , after all .
This is some awesome barbecued lamb .
It 's the result of a fairly complicated process -- a hybrid of braising and smoking .
But I figure this is the season for a challenging barbecue recipe , what with the Rodeo BBQ Championship coming up and all .
I figure Houston barbecue enthusiasts are ready to show off their stuff .
( I coulda been a contender ! )
The smoky - flavored , falling - off - the - bone tender meat this recipe yields is even better than the stellar barbacoa de borrego at Gerardo 's Drive - In Grocery .
At Gerardo's , the kitchen crew steams the lamb in giant steel - jacketed gas - fired kettles over a chile broth in a process related to the stewed goat dish called birria .
Mexican barbacoa is still made in a smoker by a few Tejano barbecue enthusiasts , but commercial pit barbacoa is all but extinct in Texas .
Vera 's in Brownsville is one of the last restaurants in the state to use a real pit to make barbacoa .
In the old days , Mexican ranch hands used to wrap cow heads up in canvas or maguey leaves and bury them in the coals .
( In the movie Giant , Elizabeth Taylor faints when they unwrap the package and show her the head . )
But health departments frown on such traditional barbacoa these days .
Borrego actually means mutton , but for some reason , Anglos are more comfortable
translating it to " lamb . "
Which is odd when you think about it , since Anglos are usually squeamish about eating veal , suckling pig , tiny cabritos and other baby animals .
Mutton used to be a traditional meat in Texas barbecue and is still found at a few African - American barbecue joints such as Ruthie 's in Navasota and Sam 's in Austin .
So call this " Mexican mutton barbecue " if you like .
A square - cut lamb shoulder is n't the most common roast in the world , but if your butcher can't find one , try a Mexican meat market .

A few weeks ago , Mike Ash wrote up a fantastic article about thread safety on OS X .
Apple ’s pushing technologies like NSOperation , currently available on 10.5 , and Grand Central , available in the upcoming 10.6 release , in order to help developers utilize all CPU cores and ease the pains of threaded programming , so thread safety is an important topic .
One of the key points to his article was the difference between “ not thread safe ” and “ main thread only , ” and I think this topic deserves a closer look .
There are two problems with the current state of affairs .
First , the documentation is poor .
Apple ’s API documentation often does not distinguish between “ not thread safe ” and “ main thread only . ”
The second is that many classes , documented or not , are only safe to use from the main thread .
Both of these problems are important because knowing this information impacts how you write your code .
The result is that your architecture is limited to main thread only .
Main thread only complicates your code , plus it means you do n’t get to use NSOperation or Grand Central at all or to their fullest extent .
Before I delve into some more concrete examples of how the current situation affects architecture , I ’d like to discuss why you would ever use multiple threads .
Why Multithreading
The first benefit to using multiple threads is that it allows you to spread CPU intensive tasks over multiple cores .
Such CPU intensive tasks are include encoding audio , video , and generic number crunching for scientific applications .
However , even if your application is not CPU intensive ( and most are n’t ) , multithreaded programming also helps with perceived responsiveness .
You see , AppKit ( the framework for building desktop Mac OS X applications ) is not thread safe .
It has the concept of a “ main thread ” where all user interface code runs .
All drawing and event handling happens on this main thread .
As a result , applications must not perform long running processes in response to user interactions .
For example , if a user clicks a button , and , in response , you perform a long running task , you will starve the main thread , blocking it from running .
If your application locks up the main thread for about 2 to 4 seconds , your users will see what ’s officially known as the spinning wait cursor , or unofficially named the “ spinning pizza of death ” ( SPOD ) or “ the beach ball of hell ” .
Regardless of what you call spinning wait cursor ( I like SPOD ) , avoiding SPODs is essential to providing a good user experience .
Keeping responses to user interactions fast means your application will feel snappy and quick .
Threading using Synchronous APIs
As I alluded to earlier , one way to to keep the main thread responsive is to offload long running tasks to a background thread .
( Timers are another way , but that ’s another post . )
For example , let ’s say we ’ve got a task that ’s composed of two steps , or subtasks .
We could create a method such as this , that gets executed in its own thread :
- ( void ) performLongRunningTask { [ self performTask1 ] ; [ self performTask2 ] ; [ self sendResultsToMainThread ] ; }
This code is pretty straight forward .
It ’s even relatively easy to add more subtasks , conditional logic , and error checking .
With the standard definition of “ not thread safe ” you ’d think this code is fine .
All classes are used within the context of a single thread , thus they ’re safe to use .
Now we see the problem of “ not thread safe ” versus “ main thread only . ”
If these classes are main thread only , we ’ve got a serious problem .
We ca n’t use the technique of using a background thread to offload long running operations .
This also eliminates using NSOperation , in its default mode .
Coding on the Main Thread
Luckily , writing code only on the main thread without SPODs is sometimes possible .
Say the classes we use for our two tasks are main thread only , but they also have asynchronous APIs .
By asynchronous APIs , I mean they have methods that start a long running operation and send you some sort of notification when its finished .
Many of Apple ’s classes have asynchronous APIs , such as WebKit , PubSub , NSSpeechSynthesizer , and many of the I/O classes .
In order to write our long running task using asynchronous APIs on the main thread , we could use some sort of state machine :
- ( void ) startLongRunningTask { NSAssert ( _state == kIdleState , @ " incorrect state " ) ; [ self startTask1 ] ; _state = kPerformingTask1State ; } - ( void ) task1 Finished { NSAssert ( _state == kPerformingTask1State , @ " incorrect state " ) ; [ self startTask2 ] ; _state = kPerformingTask2State ; } - ( void ) task2 Finished { NSAssert ( _state == kPerformingTask2State , @ " incorrect state " ) ; [ self doSomethingWithResults ] ; _state = kIdleState ; }
As you can see , this reorganization complicates our long running task quite a bit .
We ’re forced to break up the flow of execution into multiple methods .
Add in more than two steps , conditional logic flow , and error handling , and all of a sudden our state machine code gets even more complicated .
While there are techniques and tools to help write state machines , for example the state pattern and the state machine compiler , I ’d rather do this kind of stuff using synchronous APIs .
Synchronous code is easier to understand and write , thus its easier to avoid bugs and extend the code in the future .
Now if the APIs you want to use not only require the main - thread , but do not provide asynchronous methods , you ’re in an even worse situation .
You ca n’t move these long running tasks to a background thread and have to risk SPODing .
Apple Script and Scripting Bridge are two APIs I ’m now familiar with , having used them on Textcast , that have this limitiation .
The Bugs
Given the availability of NSOperation and Grand Central , it ’s only getting more important to know which classes we can and cannot use on background threads .
I ’ve opened two bugs regarding the documentation :
r. 6522412 : Thread safety should be explicitly mentioned in every classes ’
API documentation
r. 6522368 : The Threading Programming Guide does not mention main - thread safety
Also , requiring so many classes to be on the main thread is very limiting .
I do n’t like my architecture to be backed into a corner .
I ’d rather not write state machines and I ’d rather be able to use NSOperation .
Hopefully we ’ll see more classes that are safe for background threads in Snow Leopard , but this is a much harder issue for Apple to tackle .
I should probably open a bug regarding Scripting Bridge being synchronous and main - thread only , as well .
There are probably other APIs that also fall into this category , that I just have n’t personally run across yet .
“ The case against the defendant is strong and it continues to grow stronger as the government ’s investigation continues , ” Mr. Litt said .
“ Given the defendant ’s age , the length of the likely sentence , the strength of the proof against the defendant , including his confessions , these facts present a clear risk of flight . ”
Ira Lee Sorkin , a lawyer for Mr. Madoff , said at the hearing that Mr. Madoff had not meant to violate the agreement and should not be sent to jail .
Mr. Madoff is not a flight risk , and he and his wife tried to recover the valuables after speaking to their lawyers and realizing they should not have mailed them , Mr. Sorkin said .

But speaking after the hearing , Mr. Sorkin disavowed his earlier statements that Mr. Madoff was cooperating with prosecutors and F.B.I. agents seeking to unravel the Ponzi scheme .
“ No one ever said he was cooperating with the government , ” Mr. Sorkin said — though he had previously said that “ we ” were helping investigators from the F.B.I. and the S.E.C. Mr. Sorkin said he had meant that Mr. Madoff ’s firm , Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities L.L.C. , was cooperating with the investigation .
Mr. Madoff told F.B.I. agents last month that he had overseen a financial fraud that had cost investors as much as $ 50 billion , according to a criminal complaint filed in federal court in Manhattan .
The fraud was continuing just days before Mr. Madoff confessed it to the F.B.I. , according to a lawsuit filed by a New York company that claims Mr. Madoff took in $ 10 million from it on Dec. 5 .
A government - appointed receiver has now taken over his firm , and S.E.C. agents and F.B.I. investigators are conducting a far - flung investigation to see who might have aided Mr. Madoff .
On Monday , the trustee overseeing the liquidation of Mr. Madoff ’s firm sent 8,000 claim forms to people who may have invested with Mr. Madoff , asking them to detail what they believe they are owed .
TOKYO ( Reuters ) - Toyota Motor Corp said on Wednesday it would recall more than 1.35 million Vitz and two other models globally to fix a defect in the seatbelt , a component in the exhaust system or both .
Subject to the recall in Japan are 525,898 Vitz , Belta and Ractis cars built from January 2005 to April 2008 , Toyota said in a filing with the transport ministry .
It will also recall a combined 830,000 units of the Vitz subcompact , called Yaris in many markets , and Belta exported to Europe , North America and other markets , a spokeswoman said .
One case of fire was reported in Japan due to the faulty seatbelt design , which could cause a noise - absorber device to melt when the seatbelt tensioner is activated in a collision , Toyota said .
No accident was reported in Japan from the defective exhaust - gas recirculation ( EGR ) pipe , which could crack in the worst - case scenario and cause exhaust gases that fail to clear emissions standards to leak .
Toyota declined to disclose the estimated cost of the recalls .
Its shares ended flat at 2,980 yen compared with a 1.0 percent rise in the transport equipment subindex .
In pictures : Fire refugees Australian police have charged a man with lighting one of the country 's deadly bushfires .
The 39 - year - old was charged with arson causing death , for lighting a fire near Churchill in eastern Victoria state .
The blaze killed at least 21 people .
Prime Minister Kevin Rudd has described Australia 's deadliest bushfires as mass murder .
At least 181 people were killed as the fires swept through Victoria in south - east Australia at the weekend .
The man , who can not be named for legal reasons , has been charged on two counts of arson .
He faces a maximum penalty of 25 years in prison for the deadly arson charge , and a maximum of 15 years for the second arson charge .
He also faces unrelated charges of possessing child pornography .
See map of fires
He did not appear in court in Morwell to hear the charges .
His lawyer has described him as psychologically unwell and in a fragile mental state .
Marysville 's journey to hell After being remanded in custody , the man was transferred to the state capital Melbourne , police say for his own safety because of public anger .
He will appear in court there on Monday .
Victoria Police Commissioner Christine Nixon has said it was possible a devastating blaze that killed at least 15 people in the town of Marysville was also the work of arsonists .
Marysville - a town that was virtually wiped out - remains cordoned off .
Investigators are still scouring the town where 80 % of buildings were destroyed , and they had not been able to identify and remove all bodies , State Premier John Brumby said .
In other developments : • Two men questioned in connection with allegations of looting in a fire - hit area have been released without charge • Police have published a photo - fit of a man wanted for questioning over a suspicious fire that started on Thursday in the Melbourne suburb of Ivanhoe .
The fire has been brought under control • Firefighters are still trying to battle at least a dozen different blazes •
The tally of homes destroyed is now more than 1,800 , and the number of people left homeless more than 7,000 •
The Australian government plans to hold a national day of mourning and has promised to remove bureaucratic hurdles that have prevented the creation of a nationwide fire alert system .
•
More than 150 actors , sports stars , politicians and musicians have taken part in a fundraising telethon .

A reader chided me for not making note of the truly dreadful factory output figures released last Thursday , which showed a fall of 9.6 % .
I have to confess that I have fallen into “ Japan bad news ” syndrome , in that I expect bad news out of Japan and therefore did not focus enough on the details .
And while I do not aspire to covering every financial news story ( that ’s what the MSM is for ) , the latest figures paint a grim picture , even by our new , desensitized standards .
It was n’t simply that December was truly awful , but it came on top of a nearly - as - bad November .
From Bloomberg :
Japanese manufacturers cut production an unprecedented 9.6 percent last month , deepening a recession that ’s expected to be the worst in the postwar era .
The drop eclipsed the previous record of 8.5 percent decline set in November , the Trade Ministry said today in Tokyo .
Economists predicted a month - on - month decrease of 8.9 percent … .
The International Monetary Fund said this week that Japan ’s gross domestic product will shrink 2.6 percent this year , the bleakest projection for any Group of Seven economy except the U.K .
That contraction would be Japan ’s worst since World War II .
Yes , the Baltic Dry Index , which some see as a proxy for international trade , picked up a bit from its near - death level in January , but that may be due to Chinese New Year - related spending .
A hedge fund correspondent sent Frank Veneroso ”s ; latest piece , “ The Yen : Will The Traders Push The Land Of The Rising Sun Off The Face Of The Earth ? ” which gives a sense of how bad things could get .
Some excerpts :
1) The Japanese industrial production data and METI forecast was bad beyond all imagining .
Industrial production might fall by 1/3 in the 12 months ending in January .
It could fall in a mere four months between November and February by more than half the U.S. Great Depression decline which took almost four years .
2 ) Nothing like this has ever happened to a major industrial nation to my knowledge – not even during the 1929 – 1933 Great Contraction .
3 ) The trade weighted yen is by far the strongest currency in the world .
Japan is losing competitiveness fast .
Given the lags in trade matters will get worse .
4 ) The insane trader community continues to push the yen up as a safe haven .
It is all so detached from reality I suppose they could take it higher .
Yves here .
I only get the privilege of reading Veneroso now and again , but I cannot recall him taking a tone remotely like what follows :
I have been writing about an Asian black hole for almost two months now .
I have been crying from the rooftops about an emerging depression in Japan .
It has been as though a neutron bomb had gone off in the world .
There was no one who seemed to notice , no one who seemed to listen .
Every week it gets worse and worse and worse .
Today it was Japan … .
THERE HAS NEVER BEEN DATA THIS BAD FOR ANY MAJOR ECONOMY – EVEN IN THE GREAT DEPRESSION .
December industrial production came in down 9.6 % , worse than the METI forecast .
It is now down almost 21 % year over year .
METI forecasts a further 4.7 % decline in February .
The inventory to production ratio soared again .
Maybe METI will be correct .
If it is , Japan industrial production will have fallen 28 % ( non annualized ) in four months .
It will have fallen by a third in about a year .
Nothing in the history of major nations compares .
A 28 % decline in four months would be more than half of the entire decline in U.S. industrial production over the 3 years and nine months of the U.S. Great Depression .
It would be a greater decline in four months than in any 12 month period in the Great Depression in the U.S.
We are literally looking at the unimaginable .
( I am attaching the U.S. industrial production index from the Great Depression for comparison ) .
IT ’S A DEPRESSION IN JAPAN – ALREADY – PURE AND SIMPLE .
Veneroso later turns to how markets are making matters far worse by pushing the yen to an unwarranted high level :
Financial markets have only one rationale in economic theory : to sift through all of the fundamental information that has a bearing on prospective returns to investments and thereby establish the set of “ right ” prices that will lead to an optimal allocation of real resources .
Because of uncertainty and imperfect information , an optimum allocation will never be reached , but a second best allocation can .
There is no other “ social ” rationale for financial markets .
When financial markets become nothing other than a casino , as they had during the bubble period , and market participants flee fundamentals for the witchcraft of technical analysis and other divinings of market dynamics , market participants will send prices flying about in ways that have nothing to do with prospective returns to real investments .
The result will be a serious misallocation of real resources .
When bubblized markets go from a mere speculative casino to a casino in which pivotal players are driven only by the pursuit of short - run fee income by hook or by crook , you can get a more willful proliferation of “ false ” prices and an even worse misallocation of resources .
This is what has happened over the last ten years .
The result is what economic theory says it should be : today ’s global financial , economic , and social catastrophe .
The ruling maxim in such a regime seems to be that market participants will push prices to the point where they do the maximum financial , economic and social damage .
I believe that , despite the massive losses to market participants that such behavior has now brought them , their behavior has not changed .
Half a generation is enough to breed a cohort among market participants that knows of no other way .
This cohort has been hurt and has had its wings clipped , but the markets have become commensurately less liquid .
This cohort still runs the show .
Let us now apply this to the Japanese yen .
According to the most recent economic data the land of the rising sun apparently risks falling off the face of the earth .
Nonetheless , the Japanese yen soars .
We hear the ludicrous mantra from all the investment banks and all of their speculator clients that the yen is a safe haven amidst the global chaos .
To my mind the real reason why the yen soars is because it soars .
Except for a brief interlude in the mid 1990s the Japanese yen has been bounded on the upside by a ROUND NUMBER – 100 YEN TO THE DOLLAR .
It bumped against the ceiling time and again .
In recent months the unwinding of massive yen financed carry trades caused a powerful , though transitory , impetus on the part of yen debtors to panic purchase yen .
This impetus broke the yen through its magic barrier of 100 .
Since everyone now ignores fundamentals and only looks at the witchcraft of charts and technical tools they now all have the next technical objective of 79 yen to the dollar on the brain .
That was the spike high in the yen in that brief mid 1990s foray above the great ROUND NUMBER of 100 .
In my judgment it is this chart objective on the brain that explains yen strength today now that most of the panic buying by yen carry traders has abated .
Yves here .
Veneroso does omit a couple of factor : first , that Japanese banks , unlike their US , UK , and Euro counterparts , have almost no exposure to the Anglo - Saxon debt binge .
But they have their own issues .
Japanese banks still have significant holdings of industrial companies .
Under Basel rules , they can count 50 % of market value as equity .
Japanese stocks and the yen tend to move inversely , and the yen at current levels or higher has pushed the Nikkei to levels that make bank capital look less than solid .
And now that the industrial side of the economy is falling off a cliff , the Nikkei is unlikely to soon even if the yen were to fall a fair bit .
Second , with Japan at tantamount to zero rates , its currency is not vulnerable to deprecation due to short - term interest rate cuts , which in theory makes it appealing .
Back to his piece :
The yen is strengthening massively against currencies all over .
On a trade weighted basis , it is by far the strongest currency on the planet .
There are long lags between changes in currencies , exchange rates and trade .
The recent take off in the yen is not yet fully reflected in Japanese exports .
The lags are too long .
The weakness we are seeing in Japanese exports today is in large part derived from aggregate demand weakness from its trading partners .
It is the result of an earlier appreciation in the yen for perhaps 120 yen to the dollar to 110 to the dollar or 100 to the dollar .
And perhaps , most importantly , it is the result of a secular trend in which its lower wage neighbors in Asia are making inroads – big inroads – into the global markets which it has traditionally dominated as an exporter .
When the long lags between the yen exchange rate change and trade and industrial production fully run their course the land of the rising sun may fall off the face of the earth .
And with it will fall all the market participants who refuse to look at fundamentals and chase chart witchcraft and ephemeral market dynamics who have been the big bulls engineering that yen exchange rate that will maximally undermine the markets , economy , and social fabric of Japan .
It ’s a little early in the week for apocalyptic forecasts .
One can only hope Veneroso is wrong , but it seems likely that the ( considerable ) damage of an overly high yen is already done .
Marking the end of the Chinese New Year , the Lantern Festival takes place on the 15th day of the year - during the first full moon .
People across Mainland China and Taiwan celebrate the festival in many colorful ways , from fiery folk traditions to firework displays and laser shows .
Unfortunately , this year 's festival ended on a somewhat sour note as an unauthorized fireworks show set an unoccupied skyscraper on fire in downtown Beijing , and one firefighter lost his life fighting the blaze .
Collected here are 27 photos of the festival , and a handful from the Mandarin Oriental Hotel fire in Beijing .

Mulching Your Next of Kin
I ’m rather bewildered by this and therefore do n’t feel especially able to offer an intelligent comment ( what ’s new I hear you cry ) , but I thought I should draw your attention to it anyway .
Our options for disposing of our dead are either burial ( running out of space ) or burning .
It uses a staggering amount of fossil fuel to cremate a body .
Wikipedia reports that you could drive 4,800 miles on the energy equivalent of the energy used to cremate one body .
Crematories also release between 0.8 and 5.9 grams of mercury ( from amalgam tooth fillings ) , as each body is burned .
There is a growing green burial movement , using biodegradable coffins and planting trees on top of bodies and so on which is wonderful , but you might also like to consider a new process called Promession .
Promession basically sets out to convert the human body into a form that can be mulched .
They actually use the word mulch in their literature , so all we permaculturists who have joked for years that we would like to be mulched upon our demise can now actually do it .
The Promessa Foundation who are behind this explain the process thus ( see also illustration right , in Spanish for no obvious reason , but you get the general idea – click to enlarge ) ;
> An important part of the solution is to remove that which is least important ; the water that makes up 70 percent of a normal - sized body .
Technically speaking , this is done using an entirely closed individual process in which the corpse is freeze - dried in liquid nitrogen .
This makes the body very brittle , and vibration of specific amplitude transforms it into an organic powder that is then introduced into a vacuum chamber where the water is evaporated away .
> The now dry powder then passes through a metal separator where any surgical spare parts and mercury are removed .
In a similar way , the powder can be disinfected if required .
The remains are now ready to be laid in a biodegradable ( mulch able ) coffin .
There is no hurry with the burial itself .
The organic powder , which is hygienic and odourless , does not decompose when kept dry .
The burial takes place in a shallow grave in living soil that turns the coffin and its contents into compost in about 6 - 12 months time .
In conjunction with the burial and in accordance with the wishes of the deceased or next of kin , a bush or tree can be planted above the coffin .
The compost formed can then be taken up by the plant , which can instil greater insight in and respect for the ecological cycle , of which every living thing is a part .
The plant stands as a symbol of the person , and we understand where the body went .
I have yet to come across any energy evaluations that compare the energy requirements to ‘ promess ’ ( would that be the verb ? ) someone as opposed to cremating them .
The first facility is up and running in Sweden since 2001 .
The Promessa Foundation offer franchises for anyone wanting to set up such a facility .
They state that “ since the remains do not cause any impact on the environment , this should also lift restrictions making it possible to place gravesites freely ; in the home , on family property or other places with emotional ties to the deceased and next of kin ” .
I still have a mental picture of my eventual remains being interred in some south facing meadow somewhere with a highly productive strain of walnut hand selected by Martin Crawford of the Agroforestry Research Trust planted on top .
But then , perhaps , if there was a local promession facility , I could be reduced to mulch , and sprinked round the tomato bushes .
Not a bad way to go either …
' WHAT do you say ? " the mother said as the toasted sandwiches were put down in front of her twin boys .
The boys placed their hands together in a prayer position and said , " Thank - you , Lord . " I laughed .
We were in a cafe .
I laughed because they thanked God but they did n't thank the woman who made the sandwiches and brought them to the table .
They did n't tip either .
My second - best laugh recently was at the news that Australia 's largest outdoor advertising agency , APN Outdoor , rejected an attempt by the Atheist Foundation of Australia to put slogans on buses .
British atheists have 800 buses around Ol ' Blighty emblazoned with : " There 's probably no God .
Now stop worrying and enjoy your life . "
So the Little Aussie Atheists decided to do their bit for the cause .
The cause being freedom of speech , rational thought , intelligent discussion and consciousness - raising .
In the same way religious groups try to spread the good news to help ease people 's existential pain , so too are the atheists .
One man 's good news is another man 's harmful propaganda defacing public spaces .
As a rule , we atheists do n't tend to try to convert .
Enlighten , suggest and argue ?
Sure .
We 're a bit , " Well if you 're intelligent enough you 'll work it out eventually . "
Blame the existence of child abuse , torture , war , hunger , poverty , pain , the inequitable distribution of wealth and the fact that God does n't have a Facebook page .
This Epicurean riddle comes in handy : " If God is willing to prevent evil but not able to , he 's not omnipotent .
If he 's able but not willing , then he 's malevolent .
If he is both able and willing , whence cometh evil ?
If he is neither able nor willing , then why call him God ? "
The Atheist Foundation of Australia approached APN with a slogan and a fistful of cash .
APN , a company that has run religious and political slogans in the past , initially said : " Sounds good , no problems . "
So APN and AFA spent three weeks tweaking , diluting and compromising until APN abruptly pulled the plug .
End of discussion .
( CNN ) -- Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal 's swipe at federal spending to monitor volcanoes has the mayor of one city in the shadow of Mount St. Helens fuming .
Gov. Bobby Jindal says spending for the U.S. Geological Survey is questionable .
" Does the governor have a volcano in his backyard ? " Royce Pollard , the mayor of Vancouver , Washington , said on Wednesday .
" We have one that 's very active , and it still rumbles and spits and coughs very frequently . "
Jindal singled out a $ 140 million appropriation for the U.S. Geological Survey as an example of questionable government spending during the GOP response to President Obama 's address to Congress Tuesday night .
The governor , a rising Republican star , questioned why " something called ' volcano monitoring ' " was included in the nearly $ 800 billion economic stimulus bill Obama signed earlier this month .
Watch " Is Jindal prime - time ready ? " »
" Instead of monitoring volcanoes , what Congress should be monitoring is the eruption of spending in Washington , " Jindal said .
But Marianne Guffanti , a volcano researcher at the U.S. Geological Survey , said , " We do n't throw the money down the crater of the volcano and watch it burn up . "
The USGS , which received the money Jindal criticized , is monitoring several active volcanoes across the Pacific Northwest , Alaska and Hawaii .
One of those is Mount St. Helens , about 70 miles north of Vancouver , Washington , and neighboring Portland , Oregon .
The volcano killed 57 people when it erupted in 1980 and sputters back into action periodically , most recently in late 2004 and early 2005 , when it sent plumes of steam and ash thousands of feet into the air .
USGS researchers are also keeping a close eye on Alaska 's Mount Redoubt volcano , about 100 miles from Anchorage , which is predicted to go off again within a few months .
Its last eruption , in 1989 , disrupted air traffic and forced down a commercial jet that sucked ash into its engines .
" If we can give good information about what 's happening , that system of diversions and cancellations all works much more efficiently , " Guffanti said .
" And fewer people are delayed and standard business is resumed quickly . "
Louisiana is no stranger to natural disasters itself , having been devastated by Hurricane Katrina in 2005 .
But Timmy Teepell , Jindal 's chief of staff , said the governor stands by his statement .
" That was just one example of wasteful spending in the largest government spending bill in history , " Teepell said .
" The governor made it clear that we need to grow jobs , not government . "
iReport.com : Share your thoughts on Obama , Jindal speeches
The $ 140 million line - item for the USGS includes not only monitoring , but also replacement of aging equipment " and other critical deferred maintenance and improvement projects . "
The spending could provide new jobs " no different than the amount of money you would spend on building a street or building a bridge or something , " said Danny Boston , an economist at Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta , Georgia .
Pollard , a former Army officer who has served as Vancouver 's mayor for 14 years , said USGS equipment used to keep tabs on volcanoes is frequently damaged or destroyed .
He said he was n't sure how many jobs the money could produce , but , " For us and the people who live closer to it than Vancouver , it 's important . "
iReport.com : Jindal 's tone ' insulting '
" We lost lives the last time , and we could lose them again , " he said .
CNN 's Brian Todd and Matt Smith contributed to this report .

Does Mountain
Dew cause shrinkage of penis size ?
I heard somewhere that the coloring in Mountain Dew can lower your sperm count .
Origins : Wild
rumors like the ones quoted above about a popular brand of lemon - lime soda have been circulating for several years now .
The first clue to its questionable veracity is the variety of reported effects : Drinking Mountain

Or decrease your sperm count .
Or cause your penis to grow smaller .
Well , whatever occurs , it only happens to guys , and it hits them below the belt , right ?
Sounds a lot like the early 1990s legend that claimed Tropical Fantasy brand soft drinks contained a “ secret ingredient ” to cause sterility in black male drinkers , does n’t it ?
These rumors are primarily spread about PepsiCo ’s Mountain Dew soft drink , although it has also been told about Mello Yello ( a Coca - Cola product which , though still available , has been supplanted by Surge ) .
The key factor is the presence of a dye called Yellow No. 5 in these drinks ( presumably in large quantities ) , a food coloring that allegedly has nasty effects on one ’s manhood .
Yellow No. 5 , also known as tartrazine , is an FD&C ( i.e. , approved for use in food , drugs , and cosmetics ) coloring dye commonly used to give various foods ( such as beverages , candy , and ice cream ) a bright lemon yellow color .
It has long been deemed safe by the Food and Drug Administration .
It has also been in use
since 1916 , so if it were shrinking penises and testicles , we ’d probably have heard something more than rumors about it by now .
( The FDA ’s established acceptable daily intake [ ADI ] for tartrazine is 5.0 milligrams per kilogram of body weight per day , which is about .01 ounces for a 132 - pound person . )
Many other common food products contain Yellow No. 5 as well , so more than just Mountain Dew drinkers would notice the effect if it were real .
( Soft drinks do n’t contain a significantly larger amount of Yellow No. 5 than other food
products . )
The FDA has required since 1979 that food and drugs containing Yellow No. 5 be labeled to indicate its presence ( and the U.S. Department of Agriculture requires similar labeling for meat and poultry ) , but that requirement came about because tartrazine was found to be associated with a variety of allergic type reactions in sensitive people , not because it wreaked havoc with the male reproductive system .
If you ’re male and drink a lot of Mountain Dew , you will notice one related but perfectly harmless side effect : quite a bit of yellow liquid will flow out of your penis .

Hello Mr. Griffin .
I ’m sure you have heard of the popular movie on the internet , Zeitgeist .
It had three separate parts about Christianity being fake , the Federal Reserve being a conspiracy and bad , and that the government was involved in 9/11 .
Well the sequel just came out , Zeitgeist Addendum , and it seems very dangerous .
This movie screams controlled opposition / false solution propaganda more than anything I have ever seen .
The movie starts off with why the Federal Reserve is bad .
It seems to latch onto valid concerns that the freedom movement / Ron Paul supporters have been worried about .
But its solution is really , really bad and is already sending a lot of people in the wrong direction .
It goes on to say that money is evil and has caused every problem in the world .
If only we abolished all money and private property everything would be great .
All resources should collectively belong to all humans of the world .
Intelligent management of resources and technology could allow everyone to be free .
The world would turn into some utopia .
All crime would go away and greed and corruption would go away .
We should be a one world community .
It even specifically says that voting for liberty candidates like Ron Paul is the wrong thing to do .
I guess we should give up all hope and let bad politicians do whatever they want to us .
It is full of doublespeak , wild assumptions , and crazy socialist propaganda .
It also put in more about how religion is bad .
I am convinced this thing was specifically made to stop the liberty movement from achieving anything .
It puts in just enough truths that we believe in to trick people into following the wrong path .
I think statements about what is wrong with this film from liberty organizations like Freedom Force International would do a lot of good and would prevent some people from going in the wrong direction .
Some people might think the best idea is to just ignore it and it will go away .
But it appears to be incredibly popular online and gaining support .
Even the most popular Ron Paul website posted the video .
And the most popular Ron Paul message board has three threads with hundreds of posts talking about it .
Here is the video link .
Jonathan , 2008 Oct 6
REPLY FROM E.G. :
Jonathan , I do n’t like to criticize anything that is helping to spread the truth about the Federal Reserve and 9/11 but I must agree with the substance of what you have said about this video .
I watched it two nights ago and was deeply disturbed by its message .
At first , I thought it would be best to just let it play itself out in expectation that most viewers would cross it off as whacky .
However , the production value is high , the effects and sound score are compelling , and there is enough truth embedded in the beginning to capture the attention and possibly the trust of many within the freedom movement .
So here are my comments on a few items of concern :
1 . The information about the Federal Reserve is , for the most part , right on target .
However , I practically fell out of my chair when the program repeated that old , silly argument about the Fed not creating enough money to cover the cost of interest on debt ; and , therefore , the world must forever be in debt .
I knew right there that the writer did not read The Creature from Jekyll Island or , if he did , he forgot my analysis of this common myth .
For those who are interested in that topic , it is fund on pages 191 - 192 of The Creature .
2 . The next jolt came when the program praised Civil War Greenbacks , calling them debt - free .
Actually , Greenbacks were contrary to the U.S. Constitution and , although they were not fiat money issued by the banks , they were fiat money issued by the government .
That was better than paying interest on nothing to bankers , but they still wiped out the purchasing power of American money through massive inflation .
They can not correctly be called debt - free , either , because they represented debt on the shoulders of the government , which means , of course , on the shoulders of the taxpayers .
It never ceases to amaze me how people think that the solution to money created out of nothing by those big , bad bankers is to have money created out of nothing by those nice , trustworthy politicians .
Yet , that is what this program supports .
3 . There is a lengthy segment in which the author of I Was an Economic Hit Man , John Perkins , tells the story of how propagandists in the U.S. manipulated public opinion to support military action against several Latin American countries .
Then Perkins says that these propagandists scared Americans by telling them that the leaders of these countries were Marxists who were aligned with the Soviets .
This , of course , is a half truth that is just as dangerous as a total lie .
It is true about the propagandists and their strategy to scare the public into supporting military intervention in those countries , but it is false to portray those dictators as great humanitarians who cared only for the well being of their people .
That is total bunk .
They WERE aligned with the Soviet Union and they WERE part of a Marxist / Leninist strategy to dominate Latin America ; a strategy that continues to this day .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
There was plenty not to like on both sides of that struggle , but objective historians would never depict the Rhodesians ( the CFR crowd in the U.S. ) as bad guys but depict the Soviet puppets as good guys .
In his book , Perkins reveals this same slant .
He exposes the foul tactics of international corporations , the IMF , and World Bank , but he never mentions a Leftist dictator , such as Fidel Castro or Hugo Chavez without praising them .
Perkins is a collectivist aligned with the Left , and that strongly influences his telling of this story .
Yet the producers of the video make no mention of this bias and give him an inordinate amount of time to present his slanted view without challenge .
4 . Perhaps the biggest insult to our intelligence is the main theme of the program .
It is that profits are the root of all our problems today .
That being the case , we must change mankind to reject profit and we must work together on some other basis .
It is never quite clear what that basis is , but , whatever it is , it will be administered and directed by an elite group , at least in the beginning .
I was stunned by the fact that this is pure Marxism .
Marx theorized that people had to be re-educated ( in labor camps , if necessary ) to cleanse their minds of the profit motive .
He and his disciples , such as Lenin and Stalin and Khruschev , said that , eventually , the character of man would be purged of greed , and then the state would wither away because it no longer would be needed .
Sure !
We saw that in the Soviet Union and China , right ?
Yet this Marxist nonsense is exactly what is offered in this video program .
It is Communism without using the name .
The profit motive is neither good nor bad .
It can be applied either way depending on social and political factors .
The desire for profit is merely the desire to be compensated for our labor , our creativity , our knowledge , or even for our risk .
Without profit , very little would be accomplished in the world – not even if everyone spent a few years in labor camps to be re-educated .
It is a basic part of man ’s nature and is the mainspring of human progress , as Henry Grady Weaver described it in his book by that same title .
Throughout history , whenever man lived in a system that allows him to be rewarded for his work , there has been great productivity and abundance .
By contrast , where social engineers gained control of the state and restricted people from receiving the fruits of their labor , productivity fell , and scarcity was the norm .
The profit motive functions differently in different political systems .
In a free system where government does not intervene in the market place , the profit motive always will manifest itself as competition , each person or each company trying to deliver better quality products and services at lower prices .
That was how it used to be in the early days of America , and that is what led to the greatest outpouring of productivity and abundance the world has ever seen .
However , in a collectivist system where government controls every conceivable aspect of economic and commercial activity ( the system that now exists in America ) , the profit motive always manifests itself as a quest for political influence and laws to favor one group over another .
The net effect is to eliminate competition in the market place .
Under collectivism , success is achieved , not by creating better products and services for less cost , but by controlling legislators and government agencies .
It is a system of legalized plunder , as Frederic Bastiat called it in his famous treatise , The Law .
Unfortunately , it is the system that dominates most of the world today .
Zeitgeist Addendum ignores this reality .
At one point the narrator even says that the greatest evil in the world today is " the free enterprise system . "
That ’s an incredible statement , especially inasmuch as the free enterprise system has been dead for several decades .
It lives in name only .
The whole world now is in the grips of non-competitive monopolies and cartels that have forged partnerships with governments .
All of the evils to which this program alludes are the result , not of the free enterprise system , but of the abandonment of free enterprise and the adoption of collectivism .
This program creates a mythological boogeyman and then advocates more of the very thing that has brought us to the mess we are in today .
The enemy of mankind is not profit .
It is a political system of big government .
Yet , this program is supportive of some of the most notable big - government collectivist on the planet .
Marxist / Leninists may be enemies of collectivists in Washington , DC , but they are collectivists in their own right .
The Communist model is no better than the Nazi model .
There is much more that could be said about other program topics such as technology supposedly being our salvation , about the a future world in which no one has to work , and about common ownership of land , oceans , natural resources , etc. but , for the most part , these merely are sub issues to the ones already described , so I will spare my readers the pain of further discourse .
In summary , this program does NOT offer a cure .
It offers a mega dose of the disease itself .

Twin federal lawsuits filed in Phoenix and Seattle accuse the nation 's two biggest mortgage lenders of using their industry muscle to twist the independent home - appraisal process into a corrupt moneymaking scheme .
Seattle - based law firm Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP filed the lawsuits and is seeking class - action status in both cases .
Robert Carey , a Hagens Berman lawyer in Phoenix and former Arizona Chief Assistant Attorney General , said Wells Fargo has rigged the appraisal process by using an affiliated management company to bully appraisers into doing the lender 's bidding .
Carey filed the complaint Friday in U.S. District Court on behalf of a Scottsdale couple , Grant and Lanie Gomez .
The Seattle lawsuit , filed Jan. 12 , makes similar allegations about Countrywide , now a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America .
Countrywide spokeswoman Shirley Norton said the Seattle lawsuit is without merit , and Wells Fargo spokeswoman Marjorie Rice said her employer 's process for obtaining home - loan appraisals is legitimate .
" We believe our appraisal process is fair , accurate , consistent with all governing appraisal standards , and focused on obtaining objective assessments of the residential properties involved , " Rice said .
Both complaints accuse the lenders of violating the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act , which protects consumers involved in real estate transactions , and the Racketeering and Corrupt Policies Act , best known by its acronym RICO and usually associated with organized crime .
" You do n't have to be a gangster , " Carey said .
" You can just have a scheme that fleeces people out of millions of dollars . "
In each complaint , a co-defendant is listed .
The Wells Fargo lawsuit names Valuation Information Technology LLC , also called Rels Valuation , the bank 's designated appraisal management company .
Likewise , Countrywide 's appraisal management company , LandSafe , is a co-defendant in the Seattle lawsuit .
An appraisal management company arranges with third - party appraisal firms to appraise each property involved in a new or refinanced mortgage loan .
The lawsuits claim those companies drove down the price of appraisals by threatening to blacklist appraisers who did n't agree to the lower fees , but continued to charge the bank 's customers a higher rate .
They also accuse the firms of threatening to blacklist appraisers that did not provide whatever appraisal amount the banks were seeking for each home .
In Crash Course Chapter 14 – Assets and Demographics I make these statements :
The boomers are the wealthiest generation ever , they hold nearly all of the assets , and they will need to dispose of those assets to fund their retirements .
In order to fund their retirement dreams , boomers are going to have to sell off their assets .
Who exactly are the boomers planning on selling their assets to ?
Even if [ the smaller following ] generation somehow could afford to buy all these assets , there simply are n’t enough people in this generation to buy them .
Figure 1
Figure 1 : the Yellow and Red bars represent the US population broken out into age bands of five year increments for women and men , respectively .
The green circle draws attention to a “ hole ” that exists in the population demographics with the Boomers represented as the “ bulge ” just a little higher up the chart from the hole .
In red and yellow text to the right we see the six main sources of wealth for boomers ( not ranked ) .
Of the six , the five in red have to be sold in order to extract the wealth contained within them .
Now , within a single decade , both stocks and then homes have failed boomers as investment vehicles .
Prior to these setbacks , boomers had only known a world dominated by constant inflation and a future that was always larger .
The retirement dreams of an entire generation were built upon these two conditions remaining true .
But now we have ample evidence that there was some sort of a flaw in these plans .
As I wrote recently , much of this inflation and growth was an illusion based on an unsustainable expansion of debt that was destined to stop .
Why ?
Because it ’s not possible to consume beyond your means forever .
Sooner or later the bills must be paid .
At this point I am wondering if widespread retirement was a two - generation long experiment , a happy artifact of an oil - driven bonanza of growth that will not soon be replicated .
Retirement was a foreign concept prior to 1930 and may well prove to become an exotic destination in the future .
The next illusion to pop , if it has n’t already for many , is the notion that a substantially larger pool of boomers can sell their assets to a significantly smaller group of younger folks for anything close to their full asking price .
Remember , markets have a very simple rule :
Well , if boomers outnumber the generation behind them , then it stands to reason that , sooner or later , there will be more sellers than buyers .
So while I think it ’s reasonable to discount the value of any potential future Social Security payments downward , I also think the total value of boomer assets have to be discounted as well .
And this brings us to the most likely source of future value : community .
If our monetary assets stand a chance of failing us , then it ’s time for us to plan on obtaining what we need and want by other methods .
In this , there ’s a bright silver lining , because lives filled with deeper connections and personal interdependencies can be just what the doctor ordered .
Barack Obama
Gibbs Takes on Santelli
Updated 4:54 p.m.
By Michael D. Shear
Anger among homeowners about President Obama 's foreclosure bailout plan boiled up to the White House today as press secretary Robert Gibbs unleashed a barrage of criticism at a former trader whose rants against the plan this week have made him a cable and Internet phenomenon .
Rick Santelli , a CNBC reporter who exploded in a tirade this week from the Chicago Board of Trade , has accused the president of crafting a housing bailout that is unfair to the millions of people who bought a house responsibly and have been making their mortgage payments .
" Government is promoting bad behavior , " Santelli said on his network ( see video , above ) .
" Do we really want to subsidize the losers ' mortgages ? "
He continued : " This is America !
How many of you people want to pay for your neighbor 's mortgage ? . . . President Obama , are you listening ? "
Later , in a video that has become a YouTube sensation , Santelli called for Obama to put his plan to an Internet referendum and called for a new Tea Party to protest the housing plan .
" President Obama !
Are you listening ? " Santelli demanded .
Apparently someone in the White House was .
In response , Gibbs attacked Santelli by name repeatedly , accusing him of not having read the president 's housing plan and mocking the former derivatives trader as not being an effective spokesman for the little guy .
" I 'm not entirely sure where Mr. Santelli lives or in what house he lives , " Gibbs told reporters , his voice dripping with derision .
" Mr. Santelli has argued -- I think quite wrongly -- that this plan wo n't help everyone .
This plan will help , by the money that 's invested in Freddie and Fannie , will drive down mortgage rates for millions of Americans . "
Later , Gibbs added : " Now , every day when I come out here , I spend a little time reading , studying on the issues , asking people who are smarter than I am questions about those issues .
I would encourage him to read the president 's plan and understand that it will help millions of people , many of whom he knows .
I 'd be more than happy to have him come here and read it .
I 'd be happy to buy him a cup of coffee , decaf . "
The exchange underscores the potential for a new wave of class warfare as the president unveils economic plans that reward some people , often at the expense of others and without regard to who is most responsible for the economic downturn .
The stimulus plan that Obama pushed through Congress largely avoided that kind of fight .
But the housing plan -- which targets up to 9 million homeowners for help -- has quickly become a focal point for homeowners who are paying their mortgages but still struggle economically .
Gibbs ' response also indicates that the White House is particularly sensitive to the attack that they are unconcerned with the people who have been acting responsibly as the economy crashed .
The president has repeatedly said he is looking for a new era of responsibility , a phrase that he used in his inaugural speech .
In his response , Gibbs insisted that the plan will not help people who acted irresponsibly .
" It wo n't help somebody trying to flip a house .
It wo n't bail out an investor looking to make a quick buck , " Gibbs said .
" It wo n't help speculators that were betting on a risky market .
And it is not going to help a lender who knowingly made a bad loan . "
And he used unusually direct language in criticizing an individual from the briefing podium .
" I think we left a few months ago the -- the adage that , if it was good for a derivatives trader , that it was good for Main Street .
I think the verdict is in on that , " Gibbs said .
He ended by holding up the president 's housing plan -- an indication that he had planned his response in advance , expecting a question about Santelli .
" Let me do this , too , " Gibbs said .
" This is a copy of the president 's home affordability plan .
It 's available on the White House Web site , and I would encourage him , download it , hit print , and begin to read it . "
Santelli , appearing on CNBC today quickly after Gibbs ' comments , appeared to be enjoying the attention .
" This is exactly what we want .
They are making things clear , " Santelli -- who was hardly a household name 48 hours ago -- said .
" If you listen to the clip yesterday , we never referred to any specifics .
It was the notion of not going down the road subsidizing other people 's
mortgages .
I think its terrific that this has been opened up to national debate . "
He added : " I think its wonderful that he invited me to the White House .
I 'm not really big on decaf though .
I think I prefer tea . "

To parody the decline of the famous London Telephone Booths , infamous British guerilla artist Banksy puts an axe through this one .
2 Reymond ’s Real Life Transformer
One of the most famous works of french artist Guillaume Reymond , this series of performances , “ TRANSFORMERS ” , brings together different types of vehicles , gathering them according to a precise choreography , and creating what looks from the sky like gigantic robots .
3 Dougherty ’s Branchworks
Artist Patrick Dougherty makes fantastic sculptures and huts from saplings , branches , and twigs .
This one above is called the Na Hale ‘o waiai , Hawaiian for “ Wild dwellings built from strawberry guava . ”
4 Havel ’s Tunnel House
Houston artists Dan Havel and Dean Ruck turned them into an art installation known as ‘ Inversion . ’
Using boards from the outside of the houses they created a large funnel - like vortex running between the two that ends in a small hole in an adjacent courtyard .
It ’s a cool effect particularly for those who always wanted to experience a black hole without the whole ‘ being crushed to a quantum singularity ’ end result .
5 Azevedo’s Ice Sculptures of Melting Men
Brazilian artist Nele Azevedo created hundreds of sitting figures out of ice .
The installation lasted till the last one melted in the heat of the day .
6 Mortimer ’s Public Prayer Booth
Combining a telephone booth and a prayer station , Kansas City - based artist Dylan Mortimer created this installation called “ Public Prayer Booth ” .
If you ever came across one , you can pull down the kneeler and pray on the spot .
7 Broecker ’s Drink Away the Art
Drinking in the name of art … what can be better ?
On this “ interactive art ” installation by Hannes Broecker , museum goers are invited to pick up a glass and take a drink of a variety of cocktails in the container .
8 Salcedo ’s Chair Building
This amazing art installation was made by Colombian sculptor Doris Salcedo for the International Istanbul Biennale in 2003 .
She used over 1,550 chairs stacked on an empty lot between two buildings .

Mysteries :
What is going on ?
Monetary policy appears to be expansionary by some measures .
True ?
What measures should we look at .
True , never been a period like this .
Fed buying illiquid assets .
Has to do things about current crisis ; does n't have to neglect the future .
What is the Fed doing ?
Added 1.5 times to its balance sheet ; reserves growing in the 1000s of percent annual rate ; money M2 growth at 20 % annual rate for the last 6 months .
It 's buying assets , such as Treasury Bills , commercial paper , mortgages , including $ 29 billion of unsaleable Bear Sterns assets .
Paid for those assets by issuing reserves -- printing money .
Who is holding those reserves ?
Banks .
People are very fearful , worried there will be a collapse .
Fed encouraged that fear because it never in its 95 year history had a policy of lender of last resort , so it went in the spring it helped Bear Sterns ; people thought it would behave as it always has behaved , which is to bail out large banks .
Then it let Lehman fail , complete reversal of its policy for the last 40 years .
Policy change not necessarily objectionable , but it came unannounced , which created fear .
Portfolio managers did n't know what would happen next , so held cash , to wait and see .
What are the banks doing with the reserves ?
Holding the assets .
Fed pays interest on the reserves at a very low rate .
Within a bank , there is a reserve requirement - - a minimum amount of capital to have on hand .
Corporations holding large cash balances .
People do n't know what the government is going to do ; the Paulson treasury changed its mind , the Fed has done things it 's never done before ; want to protect yourself .
Fed it also holding Treasury Bills .
It 's buying up mortgages .
Traditionally if the Fed wanted to increase the money supply - - lower interest rates -- it would intervene in the Treasury market , federal funds rate , rate that banks charge each other overnight , buying up Treasuries .
If it wanted to do decrease the money supply , it would do the reverse , selling Treasuries , raising the federal funds rate .
Recently it 's gone beyond Treasuries , buying up other assets , injecting cash into the system .
Banks and people all over the world are buying Treasuries with the cash the Fed is supplying .
It is also supplying a lot of cash -- reserves -- to foreign Central Banks so foreigners can buy Treasury bills and support the dollar .
8:43 What does it mean to say the policy is expansionary if the money is coming right back out to buy up Treasuries ?
Some of it is showing up as growth in money , M2 .
Most of the reserves are being held , potential for expansion .
If it 's held in the form of Treasuries it is expansive ?
Yes , because they are liquid .
Member banks have a much more liquid balance sheet than 6 months ago .
Measure of their fear .
Traditionally if the Fed injected cash much would be lent out .
Now there is so much caution that banks are holding onto that money , and investing in Treasuries which are relatively safe .
Holding both cash and Treasury Bills .
Both will be available and will be exchanged for productive assets when the fear lessens .
Foreign Central Banks coordinating with the Fed .
Fed has the swap line , lending reserves to foreign Central Banks in exchange for claims on those banks .
Foreign banks operate in this country and need U.S. dollars .
What about foreign Central Banks ?
They are expanding their money supply , but not as much as the U.S. , trying to stimulate their economies .
12:30 Federal Government is spending more than it takes in in taxes .
When we talk about people turning to Treasuries , there are two things going on .
They are bidding on the existing stock of Treasuries , driving down the existing return , which is why Treasury rates are very low .
But at same time , Federal government is issuing new Treasuries , borrowing ; running a $ 1.2 trillion deficit for the year , before we begin to fund the new stimulus plan .
Federal Government is flooding the world ( though small relative to world 's capital stock , large relative to amount that will be available from those sources ) and also printing money to help fund those purchases .
Bottom line is money supply has grown dramatically and will grow even faster as confidence is restored .
Ironically , the biggest worry right now seems to be deflation .
That 's changing .
There is a difference of opinion about what is meant by " inflation . "
Milton Friedman : sustained rate of increase in a broad - based price index .
Other economists , especially Keynesian economists , have defined it as any increase , even a one - time short - term increase .
Falling oil and food prices cause consumer price index moving negatively , but they are one - time changes in the price level , not persistent or likely to go on .
Monetarist approach : persistent and sustained .
Distinguish between relative price changes and general price changes .
Oil price decline is a relative price change that will make the price level go down as a one - shot matter but only temporarily .
If money supply is growing that dramatically , why is that not showing up as sustained higher prices that continue to grow ?
First principle : government controls rate of growth of the money stock and the public decides how much they want to hold .
Will change when public 's confidence is restored ; then pressure on Federal Reserve at that time will be to mop up the enormous increase of reserves .
Normally , as inflation starts to be realized , the response of the Fed will be to try to get the reserves out of the system .
But this time , they will be under pressure by Congress , Wall Street , business community saying the recovery is just starting , prices are n't rising all that much .
In the 1970s the Fed knew it had an inflationary policy and vowed it would n't do that .
But when the unemployment rate got to 7 % , about where it is now , they would say they have to do something about the unemployment rate .
That 's how we got the Great Inflation , not ended until Paul Volker decided to follow what he called practical monetarism , not paying most attention to the unemployment rate but focusing on the inflation rate .
Earlier podcast .
Story in WSJ today , dispute within in the Fed about whether and how much they should buy long - term securities .
Those concerned about inflation vs. those concerned about political pressures .
Long - term securities : Central Banks consider their principle responsibility to not create inflation ; does n't mean they are not concerned about unemployment , but always have their eye out to see that they are not creating inflation .
One way they do that is to keep their balance sheet so that they can buy and sell the securities that they own .
Long - term securities are not easy to sell because they fluctuate in price so much .
By buying long - term securities it is buying things it will be unlikely to sell .
In the 1940s , period before the war and post - war , Fed bought long - term securities and made sure the interest rate did not go above 2.5 % ; produced a big inflation .
21:30 The coming inflation is going to make the 1970s look like a picnic -- a picnic on a rainy day .
Who would disagree with you ?
There are people on Wall Street , most of the people at the Fed , particularly at the Board of Governors , have their sights set on the shorter term .
Meeting at the Board in 1967 : group called the Consultants , Friedman and Meltzer at same meeting ; Friedman turned to McChesney Martin , Chairman at the time , and said :
You 've done a good job of handling the most recent mini-recession , but now making big mistake , putting the money back in .
McChesney Martin did n't think much of economists but nice man , nodded his head .
After meeting , Friedman said to Meltzer , " I think he heard me . "
Meltzer : " No , I think he understood you . "
Then inflation for 14 years .
Why are interest rates currently so low ?
Should n't they be higher , reflecting expected inflation ?
Because people all over the world are fearful .
But they 've moved up quite a bit in the last month .
What measures should we be looking at ?
Money supply and spread between real and nominal interest rates .
Where will that show up first ?
Spread between real and nominal interest rates ; moved quite a bit , no longer anticipating deflation .
Which interest rate ?
Ten year bonds , five year bonds .
Any arrows left in the monetary quiver ?
People argue that the Fed 's main instrument is the Federal funds rate , but the Federal funds rate is now close to zero , so it 's like pushing on a string .
Nothing it can do .
Not true .
Quantitative easing : they 're going to buy longer term securities and they 're not going to pay attention to the Federal funds rate because it 's so low and they can't make it lower ; so they 'll put out reserves against other assets .
But all easing is the same -- they are buying assets .
Totally false that they have no weapons left .
But as long as there is an atmosphere of fear , pushing money out is not going to have any effect in the short run .
But sooner or later , probably later rather than sooner , people will begin to buy other assets or consumer goods ; that is , they will start to accumulate more cash balances and they will want to spend them .
Traditional textbook story : Fed as helicopter drop , people wake up one morning and have more money than they want to hold , spend it .
But the Fed is sprinkling it on financial institutions .
When the banks are less fearful they will lend it out to consumers .
We do n't allow large banks to fail .
Uncertainty in the markets about the policy environment .
Yesterday 's first speech by Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner unveiled his plan but it did n't have many details ; markets went down by 5 % .
28:35 Japan : Meltzer honorary adviser to Japanese Central Bank for 16 years , including all the 1990s .
Governor of Bank of Japan ( the Central Bank ) , Masaru Hayami .
In Diet ( parliament ) they spent trillions of dollars for infrastructure , fast railroads , tracks laid down in small villages , paved every square foot .
Result was nothing .
Hayami believed that as long as banks are n't lending there is no point to increasing money growth , so he would n't do it .
Successor adopted policy : buy long - term bonds .
Efficient way to get money into circulation , does n't need the banks .
Fiscal stimulus failed .
Monetary policy was n't tried : Hayami did n't believe it would work .
One meeting : Central bankers believed there were too many reserves in the system , something like the U.S. now .
Thinking about raising interest rates ; ¼ point not enough to do any harm , but it was signal that they were not going to continue a policy of providing additional money growth .
Recession deepened .
Mistake .
Don Kohn was at the meeting also and told them in a mild way that they should n't do that .
Can understand Hayami 's unease because of lack of response of banks .
What should they be doing right now ?
Trying to clear up the mess in the financial system .
32:21 Going back to the Bear Sterns bailout / merger / marriage , Fed 's and Treasury 's match - making with J.P. Morgan guaranteeing $ 32 billion in toxic assets which at the time we were told we might break even on but now know are not worth much , March 2008 : Fed and Treasury have been trying to get the banking system into health .
Not very successful , prevented it from getting worse ; some interest rate spreads have come down .
What have they done wrong ?
Continued what they have been doing for 40 years :
Too big to fail .
That 's a policy that invites people to take excessive risks .
One of the main reasons we got into this mess : no bank believed they were going to fail .
Greenspan put :
That is , if things got bad , Greenspan would take the bad assets off their hands .
Terrible policy .
There are three things they can do as lender of last resort in crises like this : 1 . can save the bank ; 2 . can merge the bank ; 3 . can let the bank fail .
They never allowed the third option for a large bank .
They need to announce that their policy is to give part of what they need at a concessional rate to any bank that needs capital , but the bank has to first raise half the capital in the marketplace .
If they can't raise it in the market then the market has valued them as insolvent .
We have a law on the books called the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act ( FDICIA ) , passed in 1991 .
While the bank still has some remaining capital , close it down , get rid of the stockholders , sell the remaining capital .
What if every bank is in that situation ?
But they 're not .
Wells Fargo is not .
Pittsburgh National , JP Morgan
Chase does n't have that problem .
We are not going to eliminate the banks .
We are going to eliminate the management and stockholders .
Let the bank continue to run and sell it off , in pieces if necessary .
Is that a logistical nightmare ?
No .
People argued last March that if we let Bear Sterns go bankrupt , bankruptcy laws are so convoluted , the whole banking system would freeze up .
We would just have new management .
Did that for Continental Illinois back in the 1980s and sold it to Bank of America .
Where will the new managers come from ?
They do n't have to be bankers .
For Continental Illinois , not a banker .
Wo n't that be a political decision ?
All these decisions are political .
Geithner is running into the same problem Paulson had : comes up with a program that will value the bad assets , but you can't value those bad assets at the present time .
They sell every day , but their value is based on the very uncertain value of those houses and the uncertainty of the ability of anybody to put together the mortgages that have been broken apart and sold in pieces .
Selling recently at $ 45 per $ 100 - - meaning that for a face value of $ 100 , expect to get $ 45 - - less than half , but more than zero .
But if they tried to buy all those assets at that price , they would bankrupt the banks that have to sell them .
We value those banks every day ; stock is sold on the market ; take value for whole bank ; if they can't raise the capital , they are bankrupt .
Suppose a bank is holding a security on its balance sheet , mortgages or pieces of them .
If none defaulted , certain cash flow .
But because the default rate is uncertain -- and high , house prices expected to go down 11 % -- discount when sold to 45 cents on the dollar .
Because of mark - to - market accounting the bank is listing those assets on its books at 45 cents .
Some do and some do n't .
The ones that do have taken their hit .
But a lot say some of these mortgages we 'll hold to maturity , on the hope that none of them will default , in which case they do n't have to mark them to market .
While the banks may do that with their accounting , the market every day values the bank , and that price values all the assets held by the bank .
Big discount because of the uncertainty .
If the price is n't zero , then the bank is n't insolvent by that definition .
Right , but if it can't raise capital enough to comply with its reserve requirements , it 's insolvent under the FDICIA law .
Let the regulators take over before the entire capital is eroded so that the taxpayers would n't take such a big hit .
42:15 What about proposals to get rid of mark - to - market accounting ?
Mixed mind : agree that many of these assets , the market values are n't very good ; but do n't like changing rules when it 's convenient for you because then you do n't have rules .
Judges changing the value of mortgages : we have a bankruptcy law and it does n't permit that .
Bankruptcy law is valuable to have because it tells you what will happen .
Not a good idea to change it .
Cochrane podcast : let the system work out its problems .
Paulson Treasury 's answer : we asked the banks if they would do that and they said No .
No surprise !
Would you rather have low - cost subsidized capital or would you rather go out to the market ?
Of course they said they can't go out to the market , it 's too hard .
But there is capital out there .
California bank , IndyMac , just got sold .
Greenspan put : Piece in Sunday NY Times by Joe Nocera , provocative piece : investment bankers , Bear Sterns , Lehman , etc. were misperceiving the risk they were taking .
Used value at risk , statistical technique for evaluating how bad things can get and risk of catastrophe .
His claim : Value - at - risk tool is misleading because although it tells you the odds of a bad event , it does n't weight the amount of the bad event .
A bad event that is 1 out of 10,000 is one thing , but a bad event that destroys your company is catastrophic .
Similarly , some say these banks were leveraged even 35 - 1 , and in that situation a 4 % downturn does n't just lose you 4 % , but puts you out of business .
Hard to believe that managers of these firms put their companies on the line knowingly thinking that if it happens they 'll be bailed out .
Book :
Many of these bankers had very sophisticated models of risk , using things like the normal distribution , but do n't allow for large persistent one - time changes that occur .
For example , the Russian default , failure of long - term capital .
Instead of normal distributions , you have fat tails .
Taleb 's Black Swan argument , in Nocera article .
But if you get a bad event every few years you'd be looking for that .
You get that more frequently in recent years because no one is allowed to fail , so you get people taking big risks .
SEC told investment banks they could let their leverage go up to about 30 % , so they did .
Managers made oodles of boodle ; had risk models that did n't tell them about this event .
Conversation with Myron Scholes , a principal at Long Term Capital Management ( LTCM ) : you worked out what happens with fat tails ; why did n't you tell Merriweather about that ?
Scholes :
We did ; he did n't want to hear it .
One other thing :
Fed did not allow them to fail .
Continued to take the risks .
50:02 Alternative explanation , where history comes in , explanation being pushed by some economists :
Does n't have anything to do with that , just irrational exuberance , got to dance when the music is playing .
Is that plausible ?
Counter - evidence : JP Morgan
Chase did n't do that it , Pittsburgh National did n't do it , Wells Fargo did n't do it .
Bank of America did n't do it until after the crisis started it bought out Countrywide and Merrill Lynch .
Did the ones that did not count on being bailed out ?
Yes .
How would you prove that ?
Ca n't prove it .
No doubt that it induces risk taking ; but hard to understand how it induced so much risk taking .
That goes along with the fat tails -- they ignored the fat tails .
Was that stupidity and myopia , or overconfidence about being bailed out ?
How bailed out are they ?
Acemoglu podcast .
They 've lost a lot , so ex post it was not a good strategy to count on it .
But in the past they got bailed out .
Look at LTCM -- should have been allowed to fail .
Fed just put together a consortium of private money .
Leaned on private money to bail it out .
Not a purely voluntary decision .
53:33 How did we get into this mess -- one part of it .
Six reasons : will stick to two .
One is : there is nothing more sacred among the sacred cows of Congress than housing .
They could n't do enough to help people buy houses , and they did what they never should have done , encouraging Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to buy up these bad securities .
Why ?
Fannie and Freddie subsidized interest rates .
They could have subsidized them on the budget , to be transparent , what a democracy is supposed to do .
But not in the interest of the Congressmen .
The number of dollars they were putting out in the market went from $ 400 billion to $ 2.5 trillion since 1980 , over 25 years .
Question :
What role did monetary policy play in this problem ?
Too big to fail .
Second big item .
John Taylor : blame Greenspan 2001 - 2005 ?
Incentives .
Greenspan gave them the wherewithal to buy these bad assets ; but he did n't make them buy them .
Claim is : in the aftermath of 9 - 11 attacks and Internet bubble , worry about recession , so Greenspan responds by lowering the federal funds rate to 1 % , historically low level and holds it there .
Did that induce liquidity in the system ?
Money growth was n't all that high ; we got a little inflation and Fed reacted .
What he did do was encourage the subsidy : could buy a mortgage that was yielding 5 - 6 % and finance it with short term borrowing at 1 - 2 % .
Gap between fixed and adjustable rate mortgages grew .
Meltzer was visiting scholar at the Fed in 2003 ; Greenspan believed there was a risk of deflation and continued that policy .
Tough job , make mistakes .
Fifteen years good policy , made a mistake .
Long term rates were falling as well .
Why ?
They are an average of expected future short rates and they expected the Fed to continue to keep short rates low .
Tough economic times have spilled onto the streets of Venice , which has become a favorite place to park for scores of otherwise homeless people living in cars and campers .
The practice has ignited a mini-uprising among residents living in the pricey coastal community .
The number of cars and recreational vehicles has swelled so much over the last year that Councilman Bill Rosendahl , who represents the city ’s coastal areas , has proposed creating special zones away from neighborhoods where people can sleep in their vehicles .
“ The community has been going ballistic , ” Rosendahl said .
“ They ca n’t park their own cars .
Some of the folks who live in their cars and in campers defecate and urinate outside and create other issues of quality of life and health . ”
His proposal , similar to programs in Santa Barbara and Eugene , Ore. , would allow the cars and recreational vehicles to park in select “ municipal properties , parking lots of churches or community - based organizations , industrial areas and other areas that would have minimal impact on residential communities . ”
Current city laws prohibit sleeping in a car or RV on the street .
“ Let ’s stop kidding ourselves , ” Rosendahl said .
“ People are living in their cars .
. . .
So let ’s deal with the reality .
In this economic downturn , it ’s even increasing . ”
Up to 200 people are living in campers or cars in the Venice area , which has many residential areas where overnight parking is not restricted , the councilman said .
As part of his proposal , which is expected to be heard by a council committee within the next few weeks , neighborhoods in Venice would have the option of restricting overnight parking to residents who live in apartments and houses .
However , some Venice residents said they feared that Rosendahl ’s plan might also designate certain residential streets in the beach - side community as RV zones .
“ We do n’t believe the solution is turning residential areas into urban RV campgrounds , ” said Mark Ryavec , who heads the Venice Stakeholders Assn. , which recently submitted to Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and the council a petition with 237 signatures of residents opposed to Rosendahl ’s proposal .
Residents in parts of Venice have for years battled what they view as an incursion by RV dwellers .
The tensions are particularly pronounced in and near the Oakwood section , a roughly one - square - mile area bounded by California Avenue , Lincoln Boulevard , Rose Avenue and Abbot Kinney Boulevard .
Residents complain that some RV occupants defecate in alleys , party into the wee hours , and dump waste into gutters and storm drains .
Ryavec , co-chairman of a neighborhood council committee that is studying homelessness and RV living , said the panel has identified more than 20 “ relatively isolated ” sites in Rosendahl ’s 11th Council District that could each accommodate five to 10 RVs .
They include an area across from the Dockweiler State Beach RV park , vacant rental - car lots in Westchester , and an RV and boat storage lot off Lincoln Boulevard .
He said , however , that many RV dwellers “ want to stay in Venice . ”
Terry , an RV dweller in Venice who spoke on the condition that her last name not be used because she feared retribution from residents , said more people have been forced to live in their vehicles because of the tough economy , the rash of condo conversions that have left many tenants without shelter and rules limiting overnight parking on certain streets in Santa Monica and Los Angeles ’ Westside .
Terry said Los Angeles police officers have proposed that she and others move their RVs to the area across from Dockweiler State Beach .
“ That ’s 10 miles away , ” Terry said , as she exercised her dog near the Oakwood Recreation Center one recent evening .
Her 1976 blue - and - white RV stood across the street .
“ These vehicles are n’t going to make it down there . ”
She said such a move would be a hardship because her two teenage children attend school in the area ; her daughter also works at a nearby restaurant .
For the last three years , she and her children have lived in their car , a van and now the RV , which she said she bought for $ 850 when it was in fine working order .
Since then , she said , people that she suspects are Venice residents have sliced her tires , put gravel in her gasoline tank , stolen her son ’s clothes and dented the RV ’s door with clubs .
“ We ca n’t tell the police , ” she said , adding with a note of irony : “ We ’re the criminals . ”
In Santa Barbara , another town along the California coast that has become a favorite locale for people living in vehicles , the city started an “ RV Safe Parking ” program four years ago as part of its outreach to the homeless .
Seventy - five people have received permits to participate in the program , parking their cars at night in various city and county lots , as well as some operated by churches .
Under a city contract , the New Beginnings Counseling Center has an outreach worker check on participants at least twice a week , referring them to housing and job assistance programs as well as other services that cater to their financial , physical and mental well - being .
Participants are required to provide their own restroom facilities , either in an RV or a portable toilet if they have a car , said Gary Linker , executive director of New Beginnings .
They must also follow a list of rules , and there have only been a few complaints from nearby residents over the last four years , he said .
Those who apply for the program -- there is a waiting list -- are interviewed by the outreach worker to make sure they qualify .
“ We have to make sure people are n’t traveling through on vacation .
This is n’t a KOA , ” Linker said .
Rosendahl said his proposal is limited to the coastal district he represents , since Venice has been “ overwhelmed , ” but it directs the council to address the issue of RV and car dwellers on a district - by - district basis .
He also emphasized that the measure was meant to “ kick the process in gear , ” with the understanding that plenty of related issues still must be debated and resolved .
That includes whether to limit the RV zones to people who can prove they have roots in the area .
That became an issue in Ontario in 2007 , when the city set up a secure “ tent city ” near the airport for the homeless , complete with bathroom and shower facilities .
When hundreds of people from outside the San Bernardino County city descended on the site , Ontario officials decided to limit it to people who could produce documents showing that they had lived in the city .
“ There is not an easy answer , ” Rosendahl said .
“ But at least this raises the issue of homelessness to a higher level . ”

Forget the Oscars , the biggest Indian winners of the Slumdog Millionaire fairytale are two of the film 's child actors plucked from the shanty towns of Mumbai , after it emerged they are to be given " free homes " by the state government .
Azharuddin Mohammed Ismail , 10 , and Rubina Ali Qureshi , nine , who play the lead characters in their younger years , currently live in shacks in the Garib Nagar slum in Bandra East , Mumbai .
But Amarjit Singh Manhas , the chairman of the Maharashtra housing authority , told the Times of India : " We felt that since the children have made the nation proud , they must be given free houses . "
There had been anger after pictures emerged of the child stars living in squalor despite the £ 10 m movie earning about £ 69 m since its north American release in November .
Set in Mumbai , which is part of Maharashtra state , Slumdog Millionaire won eight awards at the Oscars on Monday , including best picture .
Danny Boyle , who won best director for the movie and cast the Hindi - speaking children from Mumbai 's slums in the two lead roles , has repeatedly denied accusations he had exploited the children and not paid them enough .
Film - makers pointed out that trust funds had been set up for the children and they had been sent to school .
The Mumbai board 's decision has delighted the children 's families , according to the Times of India .
Azharrudin's father , Mohammed Ismail , told the newspaper : " We have barely got any money from the film - makers .
In fact , whatever came , has already been spent .
We do not even have a pucca wall in this shanty and our future is equally uncertain .
In fact , this decision is definitely a piece of good news for us . "
Another big winner from the movie appears to be Frieda Pinto , who a year ago was an unknown model in India struggling to break into Bollywood .
But after the Oscars , she has been welcomed by Hollywood , securing a part in a new Woody Allen film alongside Anthony Hopkins and Naomi Watts .
Pinto , who in the US has been mistaken for a person of Hispanic descent ( her family is from the former Portuguese colony of Goa , in south India ) , is now India 's most highly paid actress .
Industry sources quoted by the Indian press say Pinto will get up to $ 3 m ( £ 2 m ) for the movie – small change in Hollywood but double the fee paid to Bollywood 's most famous female faces .
She has also signed up with the Los Angeles - based Creative Artists Agency , the world 's most powerful talent agency which represents such Hollywood royalty as Nicole Kidman and Bruce Willis .
But it has not been easy for the Indian star to break on to the global scene – the actress 's break - up with her fiancé generated tabloid headlines across the world .
On a recent afternoon , security researcher Chris Paget was able to capture the passport card information of several unsuspecting individuals while driving through San Francisco , using a device he built in his spare time for a total of $ 250 .
A video released by Paget shows just how easy it is to clone RFID ( Radio Frequency ID ) tags with this relatively simple technology .
The tags he captured are part of a new generation of ID cards that come with embedded RFID microchips .
These vulnerable IDs include PASScards , new mini-passports the size of a credit card which are designed for non-air travel between the US , Canada , Mexico and the Caribbean .
They also include the Enhanced Drivers ' Licenses ( EDLs ) issued by New York , Michigan and Washington states .
These cards use the same type of simple RFID tags used in shipping and pallet tracking , which allows them to be read from a distance of tens of feet under normal conditions — and UW researchers demonstrated 50 meters in some situations .
Paget 's work confirms a study released by RSA Labs and the University of Washington last year which found that RFID tags in PASScards and EDLs were vulnerable to remote capture using widely available tools .
That study pointed out while the vulnerable information is only a unique number — not a name or passport number — there is still a reasonable threat to privacy since the tags can enable location tracking , could eventually be linked to individuals , and could also be cloned into fake IDs , making identity theft easier .
( The RFID tags embedded in passport books issued by the US government are somewhat more secure , with a shorter range and some cryptographic protections . )
The same factors that make radio great for broadcasting — radio waves travel through many materials to many receivers — make it inappropriate for sensitive information , including unique ID numbers .
A person carrying an unprotected RFID passport card or other ID may be broadcasting personal information or a tracking number to anyone with the right reader .
You can catch Paget presenting his findings at the upcoming ShmooCon in Washington DC this Sunday .

Agencies , yes .
But not Treasuries .
Keith Bradsher of the New York Times , citing Ben Simpfendorfer of RBS , argues that China ’s government is likely to reduce its purchases of US debt .
“ All the key drivers of China ’s Treasury purchases are disappearing — there ’s a waning appetite for dollars and a waning appetite for Treasuries , and that complicates the outlook for interest rates , ” said Ben Simpfendorfer , an economist in the Hong Kong office of the Royal Bank of Scotland .
In some sense China ’s purchases of US debt has to fall from its current level , as the current level of purchases is unsustainable in a context where China ’s reserve growth seems to have slowed .
The TIC data show a $ 44.4b increase in China ’s US holdings in September and a $ 67.5 b increase in October , with nearly all the increase coming from the rise in China ’s short - term Treasury holdings .
That said , the available data from US suggest that China has yet to lose its appetite for either dollars or Treasuries , despite all the talk coming out of China .
We do n’t have data for November or December , so the available US data points are by now a bit stale .
But China ’s $ 67.9 b of purchases of Treasuries in October were exceptionally high ( $ 43.5 b in September is n’t shabby either ) .
That level of Treasury purchases suggests , if anything , that China was shifting funds into dollars , as China ’s recorded US purchases almost certainly exceeded China ’s October reserve growth .
I suspect that China was n’t shifting into the dollar so much as holding more dollars in ways that register in the US data , so I would discount this data point a bit .
Still , the raw October data does n’t indicate a shift away from either the dollar or Treasuries .
Rather the opposite .
Over the last 12 months , China ’s recorded US Treasury purchases have topped $ 190 billion -- a record .
Most of the rise has come in the past few months of data .
The US survey of foreign portfolio investment has tended to revise China ’s purchases of Treasuries up , so $ 190 billion should be considered a minimum .
The TIC data for November and December is n’t available .
But I suspect that the $ 136 b increase in Fed ’s custodial holdings of Treasuries over the last two months provides some clues about the evolution of China ’s portfolio .
Central bank holdings of Treasuries at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York continue to rise rapidly .
As of now , I would argue the available evidence suggests that China ’s appetite for Treasuries has increased in q4 -- largely because of a fall in its appetite for Agencies .
Let ’s see what the November and December TIC data show .
Looking ahead , China ’s official purchases of Treasuries will be function of three things :
1 ) The pace of China ’s reserve growth .
That will be determined by the evolution of China ’s trade surplus , FDI flows and hot money flows .
The World Bank expects China ’s current account surplus to rise in dollar terms in 2009 ; I tend to agree .
Oil will not average close to $ 100 a barrel in 09 .
The fall in commodity import prices will help to offset a ( probably large ) fall in exports .
The fall in exports implies fewer imported components , and China ’s domestic slowdown implies fewer imports too .
But FDI inflows will slow and hot money flows clearly have reversed , so overall reserve growth ( counting the increase in China ’s hidden reserves ) should slow .
2 ) The share of China ’s reserves that are held in dollars .
That is currently close to 70 % best I can tell .
I have no idea if China will want to continue to maintain that dollar share even as the US runs huge fiscal deficits .
But now that China is pegging tightly to the dollar , I would guess that Europe would put a lot of pressure on China not to sell dollars for euros in a way that drives up the euro .
That would be tantamount to driving the RMB down v the euro to support China ’s exports to Europe .
I consequently do n’t expect a big change in the dollar share , but that is a huge assumption .
3 ) The share of China ’s dollar reserves that are invested in Treasuries .
That share is currently rising , big time .
At some point though China will have brought its Agency portfolio down to an acceptable level and start to worry about the size of its Treasury holdings .
So I would n’t expect it to rise forever .
Sum it all up and the pace of China ’s Treasury purchases should fall from their recent monthly highs in 2009 .
But that is only because they currently are at such a high level .
Even SAFE cannot sustain a close to $ 70 b a month pace of Treasury purchases for all that long .
Not unless it really plans to run its Agency portfolio down to zero .
One last point :
Hot money has to go somewhere and hot money outflows from China could go into the dollar .
If Chinese reserve growth is below China ’s 2009 current account surplus , private Chinese investors will be building up their foreign assets .
China ’s government wo n’t necessarily be the only Chinese buyer of dollars .
Or , for that matter , euros .
Data on China ’s recorded long - term purchases are here , data on China ’s short - term holdings are here ) .

Shep here , with the rundown of the notable new DVD releases , including my pick of the litter , The Midnight Meat Train .
All titles hit stores this Tuesday , February 17 !
First up , High School Musical 3 : Senior Year .
Unless these kids wind up getting held back , because they were wasting time dancing in the hallways , I think we should be safe .
I mean , Disney would n’t actually make a College Musical , would they ?
… Would they ??
Ridley Scott ’s Body of Lies with Leonardo DiCaprio and Russell Crowe hits stores .
I did n’t see this one .
Do n’t know if anyone else did either .
If you ’d like to change that , hit up your local Hollywood Video on Tuesday .
On the other hand , if you ’d like it to stay the same … just stay at home .
If you ’d like to get up - to - date on your Oscar nominees , but are discoraged by the fact that so few are playing near you , rest easy , because Clint Eastwood ’s Changeling starring Oscar - nominee ( and previous winner ) Angelina Jolie wanders into our home video lives .
Larry Charles and Bill Maher ’s religion documentary , Religulous comes out .
If you ’d like to see Maher and the director of Borat test your faith , one cleverly edited overzealous religious fanatic at a time , then by all means , hop on board .
( Oh hell , I ’ll watch it . )
Clark Gregg ’s terminally underwhelming adaptation of Chuck Palahniuk ’s 2001 novel , Choke about a guy who chokes himself in restaurants to gain the sympathy ( and money ) of those brave enough to step up and save him .
A movie that should have been really good ( particularly due to the excellent casting choice of Sam Rockwell in the lead role ) , is too straight - forward for the satire to sink in at all .
Flash of Genius , starring Greg Kinnear as the guy who invented the windshield wiper and took on the Ford Motor Company after they tried to steal the idea .
For those of you looking for a nice little inspirational flick , this ought to do the trick .
And here ’s some of the rest : the spectacularly shitty Quarantine , the I - sorta - wish - I ’d - seen - it - and - now ’s - my - chance How to Lose Friends and Alienate People , the direct - to - video sequel Feast III : The Happy Finish , another direct - to - video sequel , Still Waiting … ( directed by Jeff Balis , a fun fact for Project Greenlight fans ) , and the Criterion Collection releases David Lean ’s 1954 adaptation of Hobson ’s Choice , starring Charles Laughton .
Some titles hitting blu - Ray this week are High School Musical 3 , Body of Lies , Quarantine , Richard Attenborough ’s 1982 Best Picture - winner , Gandhi , and Mel Gibson ’s classicly controversial Jesus flick The Passion of the Christ .
However , friends , if there ’s just one of this week ’s new releases that you check out , make it The Midnight Meat Train , a terrific little underseen ( and quite poorly marketed ) horror film directed by Ryuhei Kitamura and starring Bradley Cooper ( the douchey fiance in Wedding Crashers ) , Leslie Bibb ( the reporter in Iron Man ) , and the one and only Vinnie Jones as the mysterious guy chopping up unsuspecting subway patrons as if they were meat !
Sure , that does n’t exactly make the film sound scintillating , but the film , based on one of Clive Barker ’s Books of Blood stories , is an expertly crafted and excellent example of how modern horror does n’t always have to suck .
Cooper plays an aspiring photographer who , when trying to capture the raw and real horror of life in a subway station , notices something fishy about the big creepy guy in the suit with the large suitcase .
He investigates and terror ensues .
It ’s a movie that gets weirder and weirder as it goes along and has the balls to not let you know what the hell ’s going on until after its climax , pulling off the big reveal with a few well - chosen shots and sparse expository dialogue .
Though the gruesome effects can look a little dopey at times , it ’s always creative and fun .
It ’s so hard to find a horror movie that has some good ol ’ fashioned thrills and a cool story and never feels the need to talk down to the audience .
The Midnight Meat Train is that movie .
It ’ll be out on DVD and blu - Ray on Tuesday .
Check this one out !

NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
A day after publishing a cartoon that drew fire from critics who said it evoked historically racist images , the New York Post apologized in a statement on its Web site -- even as it defended its action and blasted some detractors .
A New York Post cartoon has sparked a debate over race and cartooning this week .
Many of those critical of the cartoon said it appeared to compare President Obama to a chimpanzee in a commentary on his recently approved economic stimulus package .
" Wednesday 's Page Six cartoon -- caricaturing Monday 's police shooting of a chimpanzee in Connecticut -- has created considerable controversy , " the paper said about the drawing , which shows two police officers standing over the body of a chimpanzee they just shot .
The drawing is a reference to the mauling of a woman by a pet chimpanzee , which was then killed by police .
In the cartoon , one of the officers tells the other , " They 'll have to find someone else to write the next stimulus bill . "
The Post said the cartoon was meant to mock what it called an " ineptly written " stimulus bill .
" But it has been taken as something else -- as a depiction of President Obama , as a thinly veiled expression of racism , " reads the statement .
" This most certainly was not its intent ; to those who were offended by the image , we apologize . "
Watch reaction to Post 's apology »
But the statement immediately swerves to fire back at some of the image 's critics .
" However , there are some in the media and in public life who have had differences with The Post in the past -- and they see the incident as an opportunity for payback , " the statement says .
" To them , no apology is due .
Sometimes a cartoon is just a cartoon -- even as the opportunists seek to make it something else . "
Several African - American leaders , including the Rev. Al Sharpton , attacked the image , which was drawn by artist Sean Delonas .
Sharpton said Thursday he and the leaders of " various groups " would respond at 5 p.m. Friday outside The Post 's offices in midtown Manhattan .
" Though we think it is the right thing for them to apologize to those they offended , " the statement appeared to blame those who raised the issue " rather than take responsibility for what they did , " Sharpton said .
He accused the newspaper of having " belatedly come with a conditional statement after people began mobilizing and preparing to challenge the waiver of News Corp in the city where they own several television stations and newspapers . "
Delonas has made Sharpton the butt of previous cartoons in The Post .
In a brief phone interview with CNN , Delonas called the controversy " absolutely friggin ' ridiculous . "
" Do you really think I 'm saying Obama should be shot ?
I did n't see that in the cartoon , " Delonas told CNN .
" It 's about the economic stimulus bill , " he added .
Col Allan , the Post 's editor - in - chief , said Wednesday that the cartoon " is a clear parody of a current news event . "
" It broadly mocks Washington 's efforts to revive the economy .
Again , Al Sharpton reveals himself as nothing more than a publicity opportunist , " Allan said in a written statement .
But Sharpton was not alone in his criticism .
Barbara Ciara , president of the National Association of Black Journalists , said The Post showed a " serious lapse in judgment " by running the cartoon .
" To think that the cartoonist and the responsible editors at the paper did not see the racist overtones of the finished product should insult their intelligence , " Ciara said in a written statement .
" Instead , they celebrate their own lack of perspective and criticize those who call it what it is : tone deaf at best , overtly racist at worst . "
iReport.com : Share your reaction to the N.Y .
Post cartoon
" Comparing President Obama and his effort to revive the economy in a manner that depicts violence and racist inferences is unacceptable , " said National Urban League President Marc Morial in a statement issued Wednesday .
The nearly $ 800 billion stimulus package was the top priority for Obama , the first black U.S. president , who signed it Tuesday .
In an open letter to The Post , musician John Legend criticized the newspaper and called on New Yorkers not to buy it , or talk to its reporters or buy its advertising space .
Addressing the newspaper 's editors , Legend wrote , " Did it occur to you that our president has been receiving death threats since early in his candidacy ?
Did it occur to you that blacks have historically been compared to various apes as a way of racist insult and mockery ?
Did you intend to invoke these painful themes when you printed the cartoon ?
" If that 's not what you intended , then it was stupid and willfully ignorant of you not to connect these easily connectable dots .
If it is what you intended , then you obviously wanted to be grossly provocative , racist and offensive . "
Either way , Legend said , the fact that the cartoon was printed " is truly reprehensible . "
All About Racism and Bigotry • Barack Obama • Economic Stimulus
By GottaLaff
Some liberals are beginning to suspect Bush loyalists in career government positions are doing their best to try to deflate and hinder President Obama 's agenda .
the timing struck Huffington Post reporter Sam Stein as "
. "
The paper published its report just one day after President Obama ordered the prison closed .
en. Dianne Feinstein ( D - CA ) wrote Secretary of Defense Robert Gates , asking him to " immediately review the circumstances behind the conversion of these positions and the hiring of any former Bush administration appointees
Allegations of improper ' burrowing ' of political appointees to career positions are very troubling to me ,
Stein is not the only media figure openly wondering whether Bush loyalists still in government would attempt to " send a signal , " " undermine " or even " sabotage " President Obama .
Rachel Maddow wondered aloud if " Bush loyalists " who remain in government are trying to " undermine " President Obama .
I think we may see sabotage as well .

Army Document Reveals Plan to Take 7 Million Acres in SE Colorado
From : Not 1 More Acre !
TRINIDAD , Colorado —
The Pentagon has been planning since at least 2004 to acquire almost 7 million acres in southeastern Colorado , forcing more than 17,000 residents off their land to establish the largest military base in the world , according to documents obtained in a federal court case .
The unprecedented acquisition of 6.9 million acres , or 10,800 square miles , of private and public land would result in a military reservation larger than some states , including Massachusetts , New Hampshire and New Jersey .
The multi-service battlefield would be more than triple the size of the enormous White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico , which at 3,200 square miles is currently the largest military installation in the United States .
It would undermine the whole southeastern corner of Colorado east of the Rockies destroying the last intact shortgrass prairie remaining in the American Great Plains .
The May 2004 policy document prepared by Fort Carson was obtained as part of a federal court challenge to Pentagon plans to expand the size and boundaries of the 238,000 - acre Pinon Canyon Maneuver Site ( PCMS ) .
A copy of the document , titled “ Analysis of Alternatives Study : Pinon Canyon Manueuver Site , Colorado , ” can be found at http://www.not1moreacre.net/docs.
Expansion opposition group Not 1 More Acre ! is suing the Army over violations of the National Environmental Policy Act ( NEPA ) associated with the Pinon Canyon Transformation Environmental Impact Statement issued in 2006 .
NEPA requires public disclosure of major federal actions .
The 2004 document strongly supports the use of 5.9 million acres of private land and 1 million acres of public land across five counties to form an installation for training all branches of the US military as well as “ allied forces . ”
The region was overcome by the Dust Bowl in the 1930s and includes the Comanche National Grassland the largest expanse of prairie set aside for restoration from that era .
The Pentagon ’s analysis makes clear that the land acquisition was designed to take place in many phases , with the first phase matching almost exactly the Army ’s current push for about 100,000 acres next to the PCMS .
Rancher and Not 1 More Acre ! board member Mack Louden said the document revealed the true scale of the Pentagon ’s ambitions to swallow southeastern Colorado .
“ This report also shows that far from compromising its plans , the Army is actually sticking almost exactly to the phased acquisition laid out in this document , ” Louden said .
“ Army assistant secretary Keith Eastin has stated publicly that the Pentagon will be back for more land in the future . ”
“ People need to understand the sheer size of this planned land grab and the disastrous consequences of letting the Pentagon get one more acre .
The damage to this fragile region and the rare wildlife it supports would be catastrophic .
Ranchers whose relationships with the native grasslands go back many generations would lose their lands and their livelihoods .
The region ’s family ranching and agriculture - based economy and the communities that depend upon it would be devastated .
And a vast trove of historical , archaeological and paleontological treasures would be lost . ”
Jim Herrell , a co-plaintiff in the lawsuit against the Army explained , “ Now we see why the Army plans to build extensive facilities and intensify use on the 238,000 acres they already have but rarely used .
The Army got its foot in the door in the 1980s with promises that they ’d never be back and there would be no live - fire .
Those promises are broken .
Letting the Pentagon go ahead with their plan inside and outside the PCMS would open the gate to an unconscionable drain on taxpayers . ”
“ Every level of democracy has voiced its opposition to the expansion of the size and boundaries at Pinon Canyon clearly and repeatedly yet the Pentagon and its contractors refuse to heed the will of the people , ” added Mr. Herrell .
On September 31 President George W. Bush signed into law legislation that continues a Congressional ban first adopted in 2007 on funding for all aspects of the Pinon Canyon expansion plan .
The ban – led by Colorado ’s Rep. Marilyn Musgrave ( R , 4th CD ) and co-sponsored by Rep. John Salazar ( D , 3rd CD ) – prevents any expenditure on expanding facilities within the existing 238,000 - acre PCMS or acquiring additional land .
The Government Accountability Office is investigating numerous Army violations of that ban and is due to report later this year .

Fighting games are one of the few game genres that are n't perfectly suited for play on the default Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 controllers .
Street Fighter 's one - joystick , six - button legacy control scheme comes from its arcade cabinet roots , but the home consoles have evolved with the gamepad .
The first - party gamepads have enough inputs to map to the game 's controls , but the physical interface and button layouts do n't translate perfectly .
Analog sticks have too much play to pull off moves effectively , and the directional pads on the Xbox 360 and PS3 controllers have their own issues that make them less than ideal for the quarter - , half - , and full - circle moves in the complete street fighter 's repertoire .
The Sixaxis / Dual Shock 3 has a recessed D pad that does n't offer enough surface area for the thumb , and the Xbox 360 controller 's D pad performance is so poor that the Internet explodes whenever rumors about an improved D pad surface .
The good news for fighting game fans is that peripheral manufacturers have prepared new premium console arcade sticks to coincide with the launch of Street Fighter IV on the consoles .
Japanese manufacturer Hori has brought its popular Real Arcade Pro joystick line to the PS3 and Xbox 360 , and longtime peripheral manufacturer Mad Catz has entered the market with two Street Fighter IV FightSticks that have the potential to upgrade how gamers view the Mad Catz brand .
We got our hands on the Hori Real Arcade Pro EX and the two Mad Catz FightSticks for some Street Fighter IV testing .
We also pulled out our Hori Fighting Stick EX2 to see how the now - classic controller compares to the new sticks .
Mad Catz Street Fighter IV FightStick Tournament Edition
Price : $ 149.99 Platform(s ) : PlayStation 3 , Xbox 360 Rating :
Mad Catz Street Fighter IV Fight Stick Tournament Edition ( 1 ) ( 2 ) ( 3 ) ( 4 ) ( 5 ) ( 6 )
This official Street Fighter IV joystick is the closest you can get to the arcade experience without importing a Japanese cabinet and setting it up in your living room .
Mad Catz has not only utilized the exact same Sanwa joystick and button hardware used in Street Fighter IV arcade machines , but it has also recognized that you may want to modify the stick even further .
The stick internals are easy to access , but Mad Catz warns that the product warranty goes poof as soon as you take an Allen wrench to the case , so make sure that you know what you 're doing before you start modding .
Inside you 'll find a universal mounting plate in case you want to swap out the joystick , and you 'll find labeled , color - coded pin-outs for all of the buttons for easy replacement .
In addition to the authentic Sanwa button and joystick hardware , Mad Catz threw in a lot of other really nice features that help to make the controller even more special .
The stick can be toggled to function as the left or right thumbsticks or as the controller D pad .
The start , select , and PS / Xbox guide buttons sit out of the way in the top left corner , and the control panel also has a lock switch that disables the administrative buttons during combat .
The control panel lets you enable two turbo speeds for individual face buttons .
The stick also has a small compartment built into the back of the case to store the cable when you need to take the stick on the road .
You can even remove the rubber pads underneath the controller and bolt it down using the predrilled holes if you want to build a serious stand for the stick .
When put to a field test , the FightStick TE worked as advertised .
The Sanwa hardware responded exactly as you would expect it to , and we were uppercutting tigers and pulling off spinning pile - drivers with no problem .
None of the game 's special moves were particularly difficult to pull off with the Sanwa joystick , and the extra-sensitive buttons made it easy to start up Chun - Li's hyakuretsukyaku lightning kicks and E. Honda 's hundred hand slap .
The two extra buttons at the end gave us some problems -- they 're set to mirror the functionality of all three punch or kick buttons by default in case you 're unable ( or too lazy ) to hit the three buttons the old - fashioned way , but our testers accidentally hit the bonus buttons more than a few times in - game .
Disabling the buttons through the game menu proved to be a quick fix , but we 're sure players can adjust to the extra buttons given enough practice time .
The Street Fighter IV FightStick Tournament Edition is a faithful companion that will ward off hadoukens throughout the Third World Warrior Tournament and beyond .
Getting real Serious players who need a specific joystick and button configuration can order custom - built joysticks , modify existing joysticks , or build their own joysticks from scratch ( much like how Jedis craft their own lightsabers ) .
The Shoryuken.com forums are the top resource for modders looking for guides and advice on parts .
You can also find reputable stick makers there if modding looks a little too challenging .
Hori Real Arcade Pro EX
Price : $ 129.99 Platform (s ) : Xbox 360 Rating :
Hori Real Arcade Pro EX ( 1 ) ( 2 ) ( 3 ) ( 4 ) ( 5 ) ( 6 )
The Hori Real Arcade Pro EX is roughly the same size as the FightStick Tournament Edition and shares many other similarities .
The Hori stick comes equipped with an authentic Sanwa joystick for exceptionally precise handling and arcade - style buttons with an eight - button layout — albeit slightly more splayed than the FightStick TE .
One big difference is that the button hardware comes straight from Hori .
The case features a raised headset plug and an Xbox guide button near the joystick , and back and start buttons above the eight - button layout — though the headset plug placement is a bit odd , Hori thoughtfully included ties to make sure your cable does n't get in the way .
The button assignments lead off with the left and right triggers , which makes navigating around the menus difficult to get used to — but they should n't affect your ability to fight , because you can reassign buttons from within the game menu .
These quirks aside , the Hori Real Arcade Pro EX is an excellent competitive - level arcade stick .
While you do n't get bonuses like turbo settings or the ability to assign the functionality of the stick between the thumbsticks and the D pad , the stick positively shines in combat .
The buttons did n't feel as sensitive as the Sanwa buttons used in the FightStick TE , but they did n't give us any problems and they emulated the arcade experience fairly well .
The less - sensitive buttons meant that we had to press down a little bit further to get the taps to register , but we did n't have any problems after we got used to them .
We were able to perform many complicated moves , like Vega 's bloody high claw ultra , instantaneously without a hitch .
Bottom line :
If you 're looking for a high - quality joystick , look no further .
At $ 129.99 , it 's a bit of a hit to the wallet , but it 's still more affordable ( and perhaps more available ) than Mad Catz 's comparable stick .
And if you 've got a PlayStation 3 , do n't feel left out -- Hori makes a comparable controller called the Real Arcade Pro 3 .
Gamepad fighting
The first - party gamepads from Microsoft and Sony may not be ideal for Street Fighter IV , but that does n't mean you wo n't be able to find a good gamepad once the game comes out .
In addition to its two new arcade sticks , Mad Catz is coming out with a Street Fighter IV FightPad that just might be the ultimate gamepad for fighting game fans .
The FightPad resembles the classic Sega Saturn controller with a healthy - sized D pad and a full six - button set on the front face .
The D pad on the controller we tested felt responsive and accurate .
We pulled off 16 spinning pile - drivers in a row without a problem after spending just a few minutes with the pad .
Hori Fighting Stick EX2
Price : $ 59.99 Platform (s ) : Xbox 360 Rating :
Hori Fighting Stick EX2 ( 1 ) ( 2 ) ( 3 ) ( 4 ) ( 5 ) ( 6 )
The Hori Fighting Stick EX2 is the oldest and least expensive stick to be tested as part of this feature , but we wanted to include it because it 's still a major powerhouse that continues the Hori tradition of quality hardware .
The EX2 features a six - button layout designed to match Japanese arcades in terms of spacing and button size .
We do n't know if the Hori - manufactured 30 mm buttons are the same type used in the more expensive Real Arcade Pro EX , but they feel and perform just as well .
The joystick , also made by Hori , feels responsive and accurate .
The Fighting Stick EX has a slightly unconventional button layout like its RAP cousin .
Though the A button is where you would expect it to be , the B , X , and Y buttons are arranged along the top row .
This layout is not quite as difficult to get used to as the Real Arcade Pro EX 's layout , but it can still make navigating through menus a bit tricky at times .
We did , however , enjoy having just six buttons in the business area , which eliminated sloppy 8 - button mistakes and provided a more accurate arcade experience .
The stick still has the bumper buttons , but they 've been moved next to the back , start , and Xbox Guide control panel buttons , where they are accessible but not too easy to accidentally hit .
The Fighting Stick EX is more portable than the other sticks in our comparison thanks to a smaller , more compact case , but it may take a bit of time to get used to , because there is n't an abundance of real estate to rest your hands on .
The controls are still excellent , and the joystick turned out to be one of our favorites after we got used to the smaller case .
Special moves that require frequent button presses like Blanka 's electric thunder do n't require you to smash down too hard , preserving controller longevity and giving you a higher degree of control , and we executed complex attacks like the spinning pile - driver and shoryuken without any trouble .
Overall , the Hori Fighting Stick EX is an excellent joystick with accurate controls and an affordable price .
If you 're looking for a great stick to start off your tournament career , you can't go wrong with this one .
PS3 owners can look to the Hori Fighting Stick 3 for a similar controller built for their platform .
Are you a bat or a ball ?
You probably noticed that all of the arcade sticks featured in this story have lollipop , ball - style joysticks and convex action buttons .
They look perfectly normal if you 're from Japan or have spent a lot of time playing newer fighting games , but many old - school players might be used to the bat joysticks and concave buttons commonly found on Street Fighter II machines in the United States and the UK .
The Japanese sticks also have square restrictor gates ( you can feel them out by moving the stick around the edges ) , while American sticks have circular gates .
The joystick and button variations have their own unique performance characteristics , but the differences are subtle , and it does n't take long to adjust if you need to adapt to a new setup .
Mad Catz Street Fighter IV FightStick
Price : $ 69.99 ( PS3 ) , $ 79.99 ( X360 ) Platform(s ) : PlayStation 3 , Xbox 360 Rating :
Mad Catz Street Fighter IV Fight Stick ( 1 ) ( 2 ) ( 3 ) ( 4 ) ( 5 ) ( 6 )
The Mad Catz FightStick crams many of the extra features of its rarer and more expensive brother into a smaller case , but the designers had to make a few sacrifices to reach the more affordable price point .
The stick uses the same square - gate ball joystick and eight - button layout design as the more expensive Tournament Edition FightStick .
What the standard edition stick does n't include , however , are the authentic Sanwa hardware pieces , opting instead to go for Mad Catz joystick and buttons .
The standard stick comes with many of the bells and whistles featured on the Tournament Edition including individual - button turbo settings , stick assignment toggling , and the handy out - of - the - way placement of the start , select , and PS / Xbox guide buttons to keep you from accidentally mashing one of them during a critical fight .
Perhaps the best news about the controller is that it 's just as easy to mod as the FightStick TE .
If you want to swap out the buttons or the joystick , you 'll be happy to know that it features the same button labels , quick - connect cables and universal mounting plate for the joystick .
The controls work quite well , but they were the least responsive components we encountered when compared to the other sticks we tested .
That 's not to say this is n't a good controller ; it just requires more practice to get used to its quirks , which are compounded by the smaller size of the case -- which offers less room to rest your hands on , like the case for the Hori Fighting Stick EX - - and the extra two buttons off in no - man 's - land on the far right .
During testing , even simple moves like the hadoken and tatsumaki senpukyaku were hit or miss until we became accustomed to the stick , but we never became totally confident while attempting supers and ultras .
The Mad Catz FightStick is probably the best arcade - style joystick that you 're going to find in an average retail store , and it's a good investment if you 're looking for a full - featured controller .
Serious players should look at the stick because of its enormous modding potential .
If exceptional hardware precision is what you 're after though , you may want to consider upgrading to the Tournament Edition .
On January 1st 1994 , a rebel army called the Emiliano Zapata Liberation Front ( EZLN ) rose against the Mexican government in Chiapas , Mexico .
Workers Solidarity contributor Andrew Flood has been researching the life of ordinary people in the Zapatista area .
Below he writes about some of his findings
Much of the discussion around the Zapatistas has focused on their communiqués and essentially divides into two camps , one that sees them offering a new model of revolutionary organisation , the other that criticises them on the basis of problems with their political program .
However , little has been written about day - to - day life in the rebel area , so when an opportunity arose to travel there in the summer of 1996 I took it .
Since then I have interviewed people who have worked with Zapatista communities .
In September 1997 , I also paid a brief visit to the community of Diez de Abril , where the Irish Mexico Group has a peace camp .
Diez de Abril is situated between the towns of Altamirano and Comitan .
It is on a ranch occupied in 1995 .
About 100 families live there .
80 % of the people in Diez are Tzeltal , the other 20 % are Tojolobal .
Many people only speak one of these languages and little or no Spanish .
As elsewhere in Chiapas , conditions are harsh due to poverty , with little education , a lot of ill health and a high death rate for children as a result .
There is no sanitation in the community , except the latrines they constructed themselves and there is no access to clean water .
Diez was occupied on 10th April , 1995 .
As a community delegate explained
" we had to move onto the ranchers ' land because we were living like animals in the hills .
The land there was very bad , and difficult to harvest .
... The majority of the community voted to call the village Diez De Abril .
They chose that name because it honoured Zapata who was killed on that date .
He was a companero , fighting against the government . "
" We used to meet where the church is now , and there decided where to put the houses , and to give a house to the international observers .
We measured the land and divided it up among the people .
Each family has a plot of land of their own and then there are also collectives . "
Come together
The church in Diez is the main assembly point for the community and all the people of the community meet there once a week - after mass on Sunday morning .
These village assemblies , at which everyone may speak and everyone has a vote , decide all questions that face the community , from whether to buy a lorry or a tractor to how the repair of the fences or the bridge will be done .
Sometimes it is necessary for more then one assembly in a week , particularly at times of high tension .
In addition there are several sub-assemblies of the people that work on particular projects in the community .
Two examples are the cattle collective and the sewing collective .
Each collective has a co-ordinator , a secretary and a treasurer .
The co-ordinator is changed at least once a year .
The main assembly may also appoint delegates to co-ordinate particular tasks , and with the co-ordinators of the collectives , they form a council which meets between assemblies and organises the work .
All of these delegates are recallable if the assembly or their collective is unhappy with them .
From what we are told , a similar decision making structure works in other Zapatista communities and , in addition , communities send delegates to regional meetings .
The Zapatista zone has around 32 rebel municipalities that refuse to recognise the Mexican or local state government .
These municipalities send delegates to the council that organises the rebellion , the Clandestine Revolutionary Indigenous Committee ( CCRI ) .
According to interviews with its members , these delegates are also recallable " if some member of the CCRI does not do their work , if they do not respect the people " .
It is this body that leads the Zapatistas rather than the rebel army or its commander , Subcomandante Marcos .
The Zapatistas are involved with a Peace Process .
But in this process not even the CCRI can make decisions , instead each document produced by the talks , or any proposed change in tactics , must first be decided by all the communities .
In June of 1994 a communiqué explained that the decision to enter talks had been made in each community after " the study , analysis , and discussion of the peace accords took place in democratic assemblies .
The voting was direct , free , and democratic . "
This account can only be a brief summary of the methods the Zapatistas use to make decisions , one which cannot discuss the problems they face in doing so .
Right now some tens of thousands of people are making decisions in this way , and have been doing so for the last four years in the most difficult of circumstances .
This demonstrates that the similar methods of democratic decision making , which anarchists advocate everywhere , are not only practical , but offer an alternative way to organise than forever hoping to get a few good men elected to the Dáil or Assembly .

The UN agency for Palestinian refugees said today it has halted all aid shipments into the Gaza Strip after the Hamas government seized thousands of tonnes of food and other provisions .
The UN Relief and Works agency said it made the decision after Hamas personnel intercepted an aid shipment for the second time this week .
In a statement , the agency said 10 truckloads of flour and rice delivered into Gaza yesterday were taken away by trucks affiliated with the Hamas - run social affairs ministry .
Earlier this week , Hamas police took away thousands of blankets and food parcels meant for needy residents .
The UN said the suspension would remain in effect until the aid is returned and the agency receives credible assurances from the Hamas government that such thefts will end .
There was no immediate reaction from Hamas .
UNRWA spokesman Chris Gunness said the agency would continue to distribute aid from its existing supplies in Gaza , but he warned that stocks were running thin .
" There is enough aid for days , not weeks , " he said .
Complicating the situation , he said that the agency has not been able to import plastic bags used for food distribution , and that existing supplies will run out early next week .
Some 80 % of Gaza 's 1.4 million people rely on the UN agency for food and other support , and UN officials say the need for aid has increased since Israel ended a military offensive in Gaza last month .
The offensive , meant to halt years of Hamas rocket attacks on southern Israel , killed nearly 1,300 people and caused widespread destruction .
Israel halted its Gaza operation on 18 January .
Hamas then announced it would hold its fire .
However , sporadic fighting has persisted .
Today , Gaza militants launched two more rockets into Israel , the military said .
There were no injuries , but it illustrated the fragility of the Gaza truce .
The rocket attacks followed a border incident late yesterday in which Israeli forces shot and killed a Palestinian who the Israeli military claimed had neared the fence armed with a grenade .
Egypt 's attempts to mediate a long - term ceasefire have failed so far .
Hamas is demanding Israel open Gaza 's blockaded border crossings as part of any agreement , but Israel says it will not turn the crossings over to Hamas control .
It also wants international guarantees that weapons smuggling into Gaza will stop .
On July 8 , 1949 , the Long Island Star Journal published a full - page ad for a community of affordable homes that the developer Levitt & Sons was building on a tract of farmland near Farmingdale , about twenty miles east of Queens .
The ad featured an eight - hundred - square - foot ranch house on a sixty - by - one - hundred - foot plot .
“ This is Levittown !
All yours for $ 58 ! ” a month , the ad read .
“ Practically everything you can think of is included in that price .
Refrigerator , range , Bendix , Venetian blinds , General Electric oil burner , legal fees , appraisal charges —yes , sir , the whole works are in . ”
Prospective buyers could choose from five slightly different models , which were all priced at $ 7,990 .
If they were former G.I.s , as most were , the government guaranteed them a mortgage , with no down payment .
As recently as the summer of 2000 , there were houses for sale in Levittown for under two hundred thousand dollars .
After the Nasdaq crash of April , 2000 , prices fell for several months in a row , and Richard Dallow , the owner of the Dallow Agency , one of Levittown ’s leading real - estate agents , thought that the long - predicted property slump had arrived .
He had to reduce the price of one house from $ 199,000 to $ 189,000 , and then to $ 179,999 .
It finally sold for $ 177,000 .
But in the fall of 2000 buyers returned to the market .
To Dallow ’s surprise , prices kept rising right through the recession that began in March of last year , through the aftermath of 9/11 , and through the first nine months of this year .
“ If we could buy that house for two hundred thousand dollars today , we ’d grab it in an instant , ” he said .
“ Today , that same house would probably be in the two - hundred - and - seventy - five - thou sand - dollar - to - three - hundred - thousand - dollar range , and it would go quickly . ”
Richard Dallow ’s family has been selling real estate in Levittown since 1951 , when his father , Ted , moved there from Queens .
Dallow has lived through several real - estate booms since joining the family business , in 1971 , but the endurance of this one has stunned him .
During the 1990 - 91 recession , house prices in Levittown fell by about a fifth , and they remained steady for several years .
Dallow expected the current recession to cause a similar downward adjustment , but instead houses keep getting more expensive .
“ It has to impact at some point , ” he said .
“ But , then again , in the summer of 2000 I thought it was impacting , and then things came back . ”
By and large , the kinds of people buying houses in Levittown are the same as they have always been : cops , firefighters , janitors , retail workers , and others to whom fifty thousand dollars a year is a good salary .
But now many of them have to apply for jumbo mortgages — loans of more than three hundred thousand dollars — which used to be reserved for the well - to - do .
“ Levittown has always been a low down - payment area , ” Dallow explained .
“ If the price is three hundred and thirty thousand and you put down five per cent , that ’s a mortgage of three hundred and thirteen thousand five hundred .
You need a jumbo mortgage .
For Levittown . ”
A few years ago , it became fashionable to deny what was , in retrospect , perfectly obvious : a speculative bubble had developed on Wall Street .
Instead of warning investors to go easy , bullish analysts came up with increasingly outlandish justifications for stratospheric stock prices : the death of inflation ; the rise of the Internet ; a productivity “ miracle ” ; the end of the business cycle ; the aging of the baby boomers .
Such rationalizations are n’t heard much in connection with the stock market these days , but similar arguments are becoming prevalent in discussions of real estate .
“ The single - family housing market is not in a bubble , and I do n’t think it is susceptible to a bubble , ” said Frank Nothaft , the chief economist at Freddie Mac , one of two government - sponsored companies — the other is Fannie Mae — that provide mortgage financing to tens of millions of American families .
“ The economic fundamentals help to explain a lot of what we have seen with house prices in recent years . ”
Nothaft ran through a list of these fundamentals : the mildness of the recession ; low mortgage rates ; the modest inventory of new homes ; rising demand for housing from immigrants and “ echo boomers ” — boomers ’ children who are old enough to start families and buy a home .
“ We are not going to see the price of single - family homes fall , ” he insisted .
“ It ai n’t going to happen . ”
Many independent economists are also sanguine .
Karl Case , a Wellesley economics professor who specializes in the real - estate market , reminded me that the average price of houses across the country has risen every single year since the Second World War .
Alan Greenspan , the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board , has also dismissed comparisons between the real - estate market and the stock market .
Speaking on Capitol Hill in July , he said that house prices reflected rising immigration and a shortage of building land .
Of course , Greenspan has a vested interest in keeping the housing market humming .
For the past eighteen months or so , he has been relying on the stimulative effects of the housing boom to offset a precipitate fall in business investment .
If he succeeds in exploiting the buoyant housing market to prevent a “ double dip ” recession , it will be one of the great Houdini acts of economic policymaking .
Considering the way that Greenspan helped inflate the stock market during the late nineteen - nineties , by keeping interest rates artificially low and refusing to acknowledge the bubble , some homeowners might be tempted to put their properties on the market while they still can .
In Levittown and elsewhere , many of them are doing just that .
“ They are saying we are never going to see prices like this again , and it ’s time to sell , ” Richard Dallow said .
In Manhattan , where the average price of a two - bedroom apartment is now nine hundred and thirty - three thousand dollars , the number of properties for sale has risen sharply in the past couple of months , but would - be sellers may have missed the peak .
In March , April , and May , the Corcoran Group , one of the city ’s largest real - estate agencies , enjoyed the best three months in its history .
Since then , the volume of sales has fallen short of expectations , and prices have started to slip .
“ Anecdotally , I can say that certain apartments are not getting the prices that they did in the spring , ” Pamela Liebman , the president and C.E.O. of the Corcoran Group , confirmed .
The market is softening in other affluent areas as well , including parts of San Jose and the Dallas suburbs .
This may be what Wall Street analysts used to call a “ healthy correction , ” which does n’t spread to places like Levittown , but it could also mark the beginning of something much more serious .
“ In a real - estate crash , the top end of the market usually cracks first , ” Christopher Wood , a financial analyst at C.L.S.A.
Emerging Markets , a brokerage and investment bank , warned .
“ Then the bad news cascades down . ”
In 1989 , at the peak of the last real - estate boom , Wood advised his New York friends to sell their apartments and rent for a year .
He is issuing the same advice again .
“ The American housing market is the last big bubble , ” he said .
“ When it bursts , it will be very ugly .
In places like Manhattan and San Francisco , prices could easily drop forty or fifty per cent . ”
Even Nothaft concedes that prices can’t keep on rising vertiginously .
Over the next few years , he predicts , they will gradually revert to their historic rates of increase : between four and five per cent per annum .
The many Americans who view their houses as their most important and enduring store of wealth will be hoping fervently that Nothaft is right .
However , his optimistic prognosis inevitably brings to mind the declamations of stock - market analysts like Abby Joseph Cohen and James K. Glassman .
While the Dow and the Nasdaq were on the ascent , these seers regularly predicted a reversion to more modest gains at some point , but they dismissed the prospect of a severe and lasting downturn .
Unfortunately , there is no reliable way to determine how much houses are worth .
Many factors come into play , including location , size , condition , interest rates , and the overall state of the economy .
In the end , the search for intrinsic value is doomed to failure : all assets are worth what somebody will pay for them .
Twenty years ago , gold was worth seven hundred dollars an ounce ; now its price is about three hundred dollars an ounce .
In January , 2000 , stock in Yahoo ! was worth nearly five hundred dollars ; now it is worth . . . well , no need to go into painful details .
Houses are less volatile than Internet stocks , but their prices vary greatly from time to time and place to place .
Taking the United States as a whole , house prices have appreciated by almost forty per cent since 1997 , which is the biggest jump in a five - year period since the late nineteen - seventies .
Regionally , the pattern has been uneven .
In San Francisco , house prices have risen by seventy - five per cent in the past five years ; in Boston , they have virtually doubled ; on Long Island , they have increased by about eighty per cent .
Meanwhile , homeowners in other parts of the country , such as Mississippi , New Mexico , and West Virginia , have largely missed out .
If house prices are considered relative to income — a common method of assessing value — prices in the country as a whole are at their highest levels since the late nineteen - eighties .
In San Francisco in 1989 , for example , a typical house was selling for a price equal to three and a half times the average family income in the city .
During the early nineteen - nineties , the ratio of house prices to income fell , to two and a half .
Last year , it moved back above three .
In Boston , New York , and Washington , the pattern is similar .
Meanwhile , the ratio of house prices to rents has risen to an all - time high .
“ Valuation looks quite extreme , and not just at the top end , ” Ian Morris , the chief United States economist at HSBC Bank , said .
“ Even normal mom - and - pop homes are now very expensive relative to income . ”
Of course , most people who buy or sell a home do n’t look at valuation ratios .
Potential sellers look at what other homes in the area have fetched ; potential buyers work out whether they can afford the monthly payments .
Low interest rates and ready access to credit are the main things propelling the market .
Last month , the fixed rate on a thirty - year mortgage dropped below six per cent for the first time since 1965 .
Richard Dallow ran through the financial arithmetic facing a young couple who buy a home in Levittown for three hundred and forty thousand dollars .
Assuming they put five per cent down , their monthly mortgage payments come to about two thousand dollars .
Including property taxes and utilities , Dallow estimated the couple ’s total monthly housing costs at about three thousand dollars .
This may sound like a lot of money for a city cop earning less than fifty thousand dollars a year , but the government subsidizes house buyers with a generous tax break on interest , and in most families there are two wage earners .
“ When I first started in the business , people could afford a house on one income , ” he said .
“ Today , the husband and the wife both work , and the husband generally works two jobs , just to make ends meet . ”
Developments in the financial industry have also made it easier for middle - class families to get big loans .
Many real - estate agents now have an in - house mortgage broker who can go online and arrange a loan from any one of dozens of financial institutions .
“ That is one of the things that has changed drastically , ” Dallow said .
“ We get people approved within a few hours .
Some of them do n’t even need approval .
They come pre-approved . ”
Twenty years ago , lenders used to set a strict limit of twenty - eight per cent of gross income for mortgage repayments .
Today , they rely on software programs , which also take into account the borrower ’s credit rating , rental history , and other factors , and some homebuyers end up getting loans with monthly payments that are close to forty per cent of their income .
As a result , mortgage - interest payments are consuming a record share of household income .
During the past decade , the Clinton and Bush Administrations have pursued the goal of increased homeownership by encouraging Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to expand their lending .
“ Owning something is freedom as far as I ’m concerned , ” President Bush said recently .
“ It ’s part of a free society . ”
Thanks to low interest rates and to Fannie and Freddie , sixty - eight out of every hundred American households now own their homes , but worthy policies can have unintended consequences .
Cheap money and declining lending standards are often associated with speculative peaks , which invariably are followed by busts .
Whether they realize it or not , homeowners who burden themselves with hefty mortgages are taking a risk , especially if they might need to sell within the next few years .
In the housing market , affordability is not the same thing as sustainable value .
Current interest rates reflect the depressed state of the economy , and they ca n’t last .
In the next few months , the economy could improve , in which case the mortgage rate would rise considerably .
Should it reach 8.5 per cent , which is where it was in the middle of 2000 , the monthly payment on a mortgage of three hundred thousand dollars would rise by about five hundred dollars , and many potential buyers in places like Levittown would be priced out of the market .
If , on the other hand , a double - dip recession materializes , mortgage rates may drop to 5.5 per cent , but unemployment will increase and many homeowners will be forced to put their homes on the market .
At the moment , the jobless rate is only 5.6 per cent , well below its average level over the past thirty years , and most people are either employed or confident of finding work .
But if unemployment rises sharply , as it does during most recessions , potential buyers will be too worried about their future to take on a big mortgage , and house prices will fall dramatically .
Realtors like to boast that property is much safer than the stock market , but that is n’t always true .
“ Ultimately , the weaknesses that infect the stock market almost always catch up with the property market , ” HSBC ’s Ian Morris warns .
After the stock - market crash of October , 1987 , house prices rose for three years , but then dropped at the end of 1990 .
In Tokyo , where the biggest property bubble of the twentieth century took place during the nineteen - eighties , the stock market peaked in December , 1989 .
Real estate kept going up for another year , whereupon it collapsed .
A homebuyer needs to ask not whether prices are rising currently but how much future buyers will be willing to pay when he or she wants to sell .
Many people seem to have forgotten what happened after the property boom of the nineteen - eighties came to an end .
Between 1989 and 1995 , inflation - adjusted house prices in San Francisco and San Jose fell by almost forty per cent .
In Honolulu , the downturn lasted a full decade : between the second quarter of 1991 and the first quarter of 2001 , the real price of houses fell by almost a third .
These cases are not atypical .
In housing markets where speculative bubbles have developed , falls of thirty , forty , or fifty per cent are often needed to restore balance .
When inflation is running at five or ten per cent a year , housing can be made cheaper without prices having to fall much in absolute terms .
Sellers keep their asking prices steady , and inflation gradually eats into them .
This is what happened during the early nineties in many areas .
Today , though , the option of invisible price cuts is no longer available , because inflation has virtually disappeared .
( In September , the consumer price index was just 1.5 per cent above its September , 2001 , level . )
If house prices have to come down in order to restore sanity in the real - estate market , the falls will be out in the open , where everybody can see them .
If the housing market does crack , the ramifications for the rest of the economy are huge .
Since the end of 2000 , housing has been the biggest source of spending growth in the economy , both directly , through increased homebuilding , and indirectly , through the so - called “ wealth effect . ”
( When a family sees the value of its home rising , it is less apt to save for the future , because it is getting better off anyway . )
As anybody who has tried to hire a carpenter or a builder recently already knows , the country is in the midst of a construction boom .
Every month , a hundred and fifty thousand new homes are being built , and in some areas land is getting scarce .
The “ teardown , ” once considered a California curiosity , is now a familiar sight in other places , such as the Hamptons and the North Shore of Long Island .
When new homes are built , and when existing homes get more expensive , the country ’s stock of wealth increases .
In the past seven years , about $ 2.6 trillion of housing wealth has been created , which translates to about thirty - five thousand dollars for every homeowner .
This is n’t nearly as much as the eight trillion dollars of stock - market wealth that has been eviscerated since the Nasdaq crash , but houses are distributed more equitably than stocks , which tend to gather in the portfolios of the already wealthy .
Consequently , changes in house prices tend to have a bigger effect on spending patterns than changes in the stock market .
Many families have offset their losses in the stock market by refinancing their mortgages and taking out home - equity loans .
During the past two and a half years , homeowners have raised more than three hundred and fifty billion dollars in this way , of which they have already spent more than a hundred billion , on S.U.V.s , furniture , and other consumer goods .
In the words of Fortune , “ The American home has become a virtual ATM . ”
Should house prices start to fall , the cash machine would run out of money .
Homeowners who bought at or near the top of the market would see the value of their homes fall below the value of their mortgages , a condition known as “ negative equity , ” and they would try to rebuild their savings .
In Japan , Britain , and Scandinavia , this process has in the past led to collapses in consumer spending , and the same thing could easily happen here .
Businesses have already severely curtailed their expenditures .
Were corporations and consumers to retrench simultaneously , there would be little that Alan Greenspan , or anybody else , could do to prevent a full - blown slump .
After eight years in which ideology reigned supreme , President Obama , it is often said , will bring a welcome pragmatism to Washington .
It is worth asking just what this means , or is likely to mean .
What , for example , is the connection between being a pragmatist in politics and being willing to compromise ?
Must a self - styled pragmatist have no ideological commitments ?
It is also worth recalling that “ pragmatism ” names what was , until fairly recently , the dominant trend in contemporary philosophical thought .
And so it is also natural to ask : what , if anything , do the philosophical and political uses of the term have to do with one another ?
Pragmatism , when it names a school in philosophy , is a somewhat slippery term .
In particular , those who call themselves pragmatists vary enormously in how “ realist ” they are when characterizing what they are talking about .
But the main ideas that all would share grow out of a certain way of understanding science and language that , for most English - speaking philosophers , is associated with the arguments of W.V. O. Quine ( and in a somewhat different way , Ludwig Wittgenstein ) .
Quine argued that it was a mistake to think of claims about the world , whether they were ordinary common sense claims like “ the stove is hot , ” or theoretical claims like “ temperature is mean kinetic energy , ” as having their meaning “ individually , ” as individual sentences , and as such , describe some bit of the world they could be matched or tested against .
Rather , all our remarks about the world , from ordinary observations through theoretical posits ( “ that ’s gravity for you ! ” ) , even including the very abstract laws of logic , had to be thought of as enmeshed within one smoothly interrelated scheme , a single “ web of belief , ” and when trouble strikes , when the experiment or observation does not go as we predict , it is entirely up to us to adjust the scheme wherever we wish .
It will be for pragmatic reasons that we choose to leave the observation claim intact and look to theory for adjustment , and equally , it is merely for pragmatic reasons ( not out of any misplaced sense of “ necessity , ” for in this view , there is no such thing ) that we will probably choose to leave the laws of logic alone too .
So when the experiment regarding the speed of light goes differently than we thought , what follows ?
We could affirm all our Newtonian theory and deny the observation , adjusting our web of belief there ; or we could affirm it all and alter our logic , alter say the law of the excluded middle .
The right choice would seem to be Einstein ’s alternative conception of light and time — but that is just because that revision causes the least disruption in the scheme overall .
It is , pragmatically , the most sensible change to make , that ’s all .
To say Einstein ’s view “ is true ” is just to say the overall scheme we like best — the scheme we choose for pragmatic reasons — includes it .
Now for some , such as Richard Rorty , this was just the start of the argument .
Rorty thought we could not speak of “ the world ” ( or any part of it ) apart from the conceptions by which we picked it out , and so we could not be realists about what we spoke of , or referred to .
This strand of the argument has roots that reach back to Kant : we know the world by the concepts we impose on it , and so any talk of “ the world ” apart from those concepts must be impossible , self - contradictory .
Thus Rorty represents a strand of anti-realism in pragmatism , and this is the strand most closely associated with continental thinkers such as Barthes and Derrida too .
Language one might say , in this view , runs all the way down .
The things we speak of have the character they have because we characterize them as we do .
Alternative characterizations are certainly possible — for reasons of habit or culture ( or if we are speaking of political institutions , it is typically said , for reasons of power ) we use the ones we do , but it is a mistake to see the descriptions or characterizations we do use as “ driven by ” or “ determined by ” the world as it is apart from us .
How could that be ?
Since we can not pick out any bit of “ the world ” without employing some conceptual scheme or other , how can we speak of the scheme we do employ as vindicated by some neutral nature , by how the world is apart from us — or , to use Rorty ’s useful and mocking phrase , by how Nature would describe Herself if only She could speak ?
Ironically , though the word “ pragmatism ” has connotations of the sensible and familiar , when used to stand for this set of arguments , it refers to a puzzling anti-realism , and it is this strand of pragmatism that is no longer as highly regarded as it was twenty years ago .
Philosophers today tend to be very wary of a view that cannot make sense of our causal relation to the world as giving us genuine knowledge of how the world is .
It seems just flat out wrong to think that I do not detect an actual difference in actual temperature when I put my hand on the stove .
But the idea that our claims about the world must be understood holistically , that no sentence can be thought of as facing the world “ on its own ” — this strand of philosophical pragmatism remains intact .
Now when the term is used politically , “ pragmatism ” tends to mean something like “ driven largely by regard for good consequences . ”
The good pragmatist , it is said , will be indifferent to which side of the political spectrum champions a policy , and asks only how well will the policy work .
The current bailout proposals are good examples .
Though strong government involvement in an economy might be favored by New Deal Democrats and decried by proponents of a pure free market , the pragmatist could not care less what the pedigree of an idea is , who likes it , who does n’t , and why .
A pragmatist in this sense of the term just wants evidence of its likelihood to succeed or fail given a set of facts in the background .
If it works well , generates good results , fine ; it will be embraced .
If not , it is cast aside .
There is no interest in ideological purity , and no embarrassment if one uses one policy against one set of facts and what might in some ways be a contrary one against another .
Now , two things are left out of this account so far , and these things are uncertain as we look towards the future under Obama .
The first is what the political goals or aspirations will be .
“ Political pragmatism ” refers to a kind of willingness to do whatever works to reach the desired goal , but it does not , it cannot , say what that goal will be .
For example , right now , confronting our looming economic depression is a non-controversial and urgent goal ; no one denies its importance .
But what about reducing class differences , or reducing the prison population , or reducing the population of unwed mothers ?
There are many possible goals the Obama administration may or may not pursue with pragmatist energy .
But being committed to non-ideological pragmatism in its own right does not say anything as to which projects you will be a pragmatist about , what you will give priority to and what you will let slide .
Some projects are themselves non-partisan , such as addressing an economic depression .
But most others are not , and when we turn to which of these will be taken up , some ideology or commitment to principles must enter in .
Just what the commitments of the Obama administration turn out to be before these more optional matters will simply have to be seen as they unfold in time .
Secondly , there is a complicated connection between “ pragmatism ” and “ compromise . ”
In some matters , the pragmatist may reasonably believe there really is a best , most pragmatic solution .
For example , it really may be a fact that certain government policies will turn the economy around and others will not , it really may be a fact that certain policies will reduce AIDS infection rates and others will not .
Here , before these kinds of issues , a good pragmatist will be as hostile to compromise as any ideologue .
Since he wants the best outcome , and such and such policy just is the best way to get that , there is no good reason to swerve from this course .
But in other contexts it may be that there is no clear “ fact of the matter ” and disagreement is more over the sensibility or symbol .
Here the pragmatist may indeed compromise , or seek compromise , for here compromise may itself be “ the best outcome . ”
There is no clear factual answer to the question “ how much should we spend on the arts ? ” ( as opposed to the space program ) .
In a case like this , the good pragmatist may seek compromise between the warring parties without feeling he has sacrificed his principles .
It will be interesting to see where Obama draws this line , where he feels there is a right answer that must be achieved in the best possible way , and where he feels there are reasonable opinions on both sides , neither better nor worse than the other ; and so here we must just divide the issue as best we can .
For example , it will be interesting how he sees sexual education policies , gun control , capital punishment , charter schools and perhaps even some of the issues at the edges of abortion rights ( like parental notification issues ) — are these issues about which there is no clear right or wrong , just reasonable differences , and so we must compromise as best we can ( unlike the ideologues of the Bush era ) , or , are these issues where there are clear human rights that must be respected , and compromise is a last resort ?
I have my own ideas as to where Obama will stand on this list , but right now , as we look forward and speculate about this very important matter , only time will tell .
It might appear then that the expression “ pragmatism ” shares little across its philosophical and political uses , but this is not quite right .
Certainly , you would be disappointed if , knowing what it means in one context , you expected the counterpart view in the other .
Political pragmatists are not generally anti-realists , and philosophical pragmatists do not champion their freedom from deference to ideological consistency .
But the ideas of flexibility , of freedom to revise where necessary in order to reach the goal in question­ — these are the underlying themes of pragmatism in any domain .

Now that he ’s in office , Obama ’s approval ratings are starting to normalize , as partisan back - and - forth picks up .
Just a week ago , Gallup found an astonishing 83 percent approval of how he has handled his transition , showing he had even won over most Republicans .

The new job - approval figure puts him at the upper end of opening poll numbers for presidents , but does n’t set a record .
Gallup ’s initial job approval ratings were President John F. Kennedy , 72 percent ; Dwight Eisenhower , 68 percent ; Jimmy Carter , 66 percent ; Richard Nixon , 59 percent ; Bill Clinton , 58 percent ; George W. Bush , 57 percent ; and Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush , 51 percent .
Gallup ’s Obama poll included 1,591 adults , and has a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points .
For Obama , 12 percent disapproved and 21 percent had no opinion .
Bush hit a low of 25 percent approval late last year , but he rebounded somewhat before leaving office .
Banks around the world desperately want bailouts of billions of dollars , but they also have another need they ’re unaware of : women , women and women .
At the recent World Economic Forum in Davos , Switzerland , some of the most interesting discussions revolved around whether we would be in the same mess today if Lehman Brothers had been Lehman Sisters .
The consensus ( and this is among the dead white men who parade annually at Davos ) is that the optimal bank would have been Lehman Brothers and Sisters .
Wall Street is one of the most male - dominated bastions in the business world ; senior staff meetings resemble a urologist ’s waiting room .

( CNN ) -- Lavish weddings on soap operas are commonplace -- beautiful , wealthy characters united amid copious tears , heaps of flowers and exquisite attire .
Actresses Tamara Braun and Eden Riegel take part in the wedding as depicted on ABC's " All My Children . "
Monday 's ceremony on ABC's " All My Children " was much the same , except for the couple : Bianca Montgomery and Reese Williams , both wearing designer dresses , united in daytime television 's first lesbian wedding .
" When my character did first come out of the closet , there was a lot of negative reaction , " said Eden Riegel , the actress who plays Bianca .
Her character is the daughter of Erica Kane , a longtime mainstay on the show played by Susan Lucci .
" People were very protective of Erica Kane 's daughter , and I think that the beauty of the show is that we were able to reach people and get people sort of used to the idea , " Riegel said .
Watch the actress talk about her character and the wedding »
The ceremony , portions of which were posted on a Web site dedicated to ABC daytime television and SOAPnet.com , featured both women wearing designer dresses and holding red roses .
" I promise to love you and devote myself to you , " says a tearful Reese , played by Tamara Braun , during the ceremony , her hands in Bianca's .
" Because standing here with you , it 's where I belong . "
Lucci said , " Once Bianca came out and said she was gay , Erica said , ' But no !
You wo n't get married ! '
Well , now that Bianca is getting married , you know , the other part of Erica is like , ' Hooray ! '
You know ?
' I get to plan my daughter 's wedding after all ! ' "
At least one religious group , however , expressed its disapproval of the nuptials .
" I think it is really important to understand that there are a lot of things that people do n't really want to see and do n't want coming into their homes , and lesbian weddings are certainly one of them , " said Glenn Stanton of the group Focus on the Family .
But gay and lesbian groups hailed the televised wedding as a victory .
" It 's reality , " said Neil Giuliano , president of the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation ( GLAAD ) .
" So when we see a lesbian couple getting married on daytime drama , it simply reflects what 's happening in the real world . "
Actress Braun said , " If you are brave enough to want to get married , especially with the divorce rate as high as it is , then you should have that right no matter what sex you are , who you love , what color you are , how many extra toes and feet you have ... equal rights for all people . "
Recent high - profile same - sex weddings included that of talk show host Ellen DeGeneres and her partner , actress Portia de Rossi , last August .
However , same - sex marriage remains a hot - button issue in many states -- particularly California .
The state was one of several to ban same - sex marriage in the November 4 elections .
But unlike the others , California had been issuing marriage licenses to same - sex couples since a May 15 ruling by the state Supreme Court legalized the unions .
However , California 's Proposition 8 , the measure outlawing same - sex marriage , passed with about 52.5 percent of the vote .
Three groups -- the American Civil Liberties Union , gay - rights group Lambda Legal and the National Center for Lesbian Rights -- filed a legal challenge to the vote , asking the state Supreme Court to rule the ballot - initiative process was " improperly used " to strip away a right protected by the state constitution .
The court has said it will hear the appeal , but will not block the implementation or enforcement of the law in the meantime .
Arguments in the case could be heard as early as next month .
Same - sex marriage is legal in Massachusetts and Connecticut .
Rhode Island recognizes same - sex marriages from other states , and Vermont , New Jersey and New Hampshire allow civil unions .

[ digg - reddit - me ] According to Wikipedia , “ the Congressional Research Service ( CRS ) is the public policy research arm of the United States Congress .
As a legislative branch agency within the Library of Congress , CRS works exclusively and directly for Members of Congress , their Committees and staff on a confidential , nonpartisan basis .
CRS reports are highly regarded as in - depth , accurate , objective , and timely , but as a matter of policy they are not made directly available to members of the public . ”
Which makes the reports it has prepared on various stimulus measures extremely interesting – as their reports strive to give the consensus expert view of the issues involved , without partisan affiliation .
I ’ve prepared some highlights from the non-partisan ( and confidental ) CRS reports on the effectiveness of tax cuts and other stimulus measures ( available thanks to Wikileaks … H /t Marc . )
CRS – RS21126 – Tax Cuts and Economic Stimulus : How Effective Are the Alternatives ( PDF )
The summary :
While temporary individual tax cuts likely have smaller effects than permanent ones , temporary cuts contingent on spending ( such as temporary investment subsidies or a sales tax holiday ) are likely more effective than permanent cuts .
( Sales tax holidays may , however , be very difficult to implement in a timely fashion ) .
The report offers a quick explanation of why tax cuts are n’t ideal short term stimulus on page 1 :
A tax cut that is saved will have no short term stimulative economic effect ( or long term one , if the cut is financed by a deficit , since increased private saving would be offset by decreased government saving ) .
Thus , in general , tax cuts received by individuals will not be successful as a short run stimulus if they lead to additional saving , and tax cuts received by firms will not be successful unless they lead to spending on investment ( or lead quickly to spending on consumption by shareholders ) .
The problem in this instance is that private virtue – saving money – undermines the public good stimulus seeks to achieve – stimulating the economy – which can only be achieved by spending money .
The report discusses corporate tax cuts on page 5 :
General corporate rate cuts are less likely to be effective than investment subsidies because they have a smaller “ bang - for - the - buck . ” because much of their cost is a windfall that only affects cash flow and not the return to new investment .
Since even temporary investment subsidies do not appear to have worked effectively , a corporate rate cut would be expected to have a small effect .
CRS – Report R4104 – Economic Stimulus : Issues and Policies ( PDF ) ( It appears the Wikileaks link is down , so try this . )
The summary :
Economists generally agree that spending proposals are somewhat more stimulative than tax cuts since part of a tax cut may be saved by the recipients .
The most important determinant of the effect on the economy is the stimulus ’ size .
[ my emphasis ]
The report describes the cause of our current panic / crisis as the ripple effect of the sudden collapse of Lehman Brothers , the near miss at Merrill Lynch , and the government rescue of AIG – all following upon the failure of other large institutions over the months before hand – from Bear Stearns to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
These actions eroded market confidence further , resulting in a sudden spike of the commercial paper rate spread from just under 90 basis points to 280 basis points , a spike that in times past might have been called a panic .
If financial market confidence is not restored and private market spreads remain elevated , the broader economy could slow more due to difficulties in financing consumer durables , business investment , college education , and other big ticket items .
The report does n’t get into telling the story of how the world economy almost came to an end at 2 pm on September 18 .
One of the problems the report explains with stimulus is that we can only design it to be effective based on our economic forecasts .
As the report explains on page 8 , economic forecasting has its problems :
Economic forecasts are notoriously inaccurate due to the highly complex and changing nature of the economy , so it is difficult to accurately assess how deep the downturn will be , and how much fiscal stimulus would be an appropriate response .
But the report nevertheless ventures a guess , on page 2 , based not on any particular forecaster , but only the consensus among them :
Forecasters now predict that GDP will continue to contract until the second half of 2009 and the rate of decline will accelerate .
If correct , this recession would be the longest in the period since World War II .
The report discusses three elements by which to judge the stimulus – how fast it works ; how effective the stimulus is per dollar paid ; and the size .
Predicting the right size for the stimulus must primarily be based on the economic forecasts – which the report notes are “ notoriously inaccurate . ”
But the first two measures should be maximized no matter what the forecast is .
The report describes why effectiveness is important in a section called “ Bang for the Buck ” on page 8 :
If the goal of stimulus is to maximize the boost to total spending while minimizing the increase in the budget deficit ( in order to minimize the deleterious effects of “ crowding out ” ) , then maximum bang for the buck would be desirable .
The primary way to achieve the most bang for the buck is by choosing policies that result in spending , not saving .
Direct government spending on goods and services would therefore lead to the most bang for the buck since none of it would be saved …
One non-spending measures the report analyzes is seen to have a good “ bang for the buck ” but to take too long to act :
Investment incentives are attractive , if they work , because increasing investment does not trade off short term stimulus benefits for a reduction in capital formation , as do provisions stimulating consumption .
Nevertheless , most evidence does not suggest these provisions work very well to induce short - term spending .
This lack of effectiveness may occur because of planning lags or because stimulus is generally provided during economic slowdowns when excess capacity may already exist .
On page 10 , the report cites Mark Zandi of Moody ’s Economy.com , and an advisor to John McCain , and includes a chart of his estimates of the multiplier effect of the various policy proposals .
The report qualifies it ’s endorsement of Zandi ’s work , saying , that there is significant disagreement about fundamental matters among economists , but that :
Qualitatively , most economists would likely agree with the general thrust of [ Zandi ’s ] estimates , however — spending provisions have higher multipliers becausetax cuts are partially saved , and some types of tax cuts are more likely to be saved by theirrecipients than others .
I ’ve graphed the values Zandi provides to give a visual measure of the different in the types of stimulus :
[ Click on the image for a larger version of the chart . ]
As you can see , the spending measures have far greater “ bang for the buck ” values .
The report acknowledges that Zandi’s and most other economic models might understate the stimulus from tax cuts – but the alternate explanation for the data given by defenders of tax cuts is that they take longer to have an effect :
there is a behavioral lag , since time elapses before the recipient of a transfer or tax cut increases their spending .
For example , the initial reaction to the receipt of rebate checks was a large spike in the personal saving rate …
It is unclear how to target recipients that would spend most quickly , although presumably liquidity - constrained households ( i.e. , those with limited access to credit ) would spend more quickly than others .
In this regard , the advantage to direct government spending is that there is no analogous lag .
These reports seems to provide a good deal of information mainly missing from the public debates – as Republicans talked about tax cuts , tax cuts , tax cuts as the best type of stimulus .
Whether the stimulus bill we end up with works or not , these reports at least help explain the assumptions underlying it .

February 6 , 2009 -- The International Socialist Organisation Zimbabwe ( ISOZ ) has consistently argued for the last few years that the poor and working people would pay dearly if they naively followed the false calls for “ change ” championed by the Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) and its imperialist - supported civic society allies , and subordinated their organisations to the same .
We called for the urgent establishment of a radical and anti-neoliberal united front of working people 's organisations , to spearhead the struggle even when the opposition leadership eventually sold out .
We argued that the MDC was preparing for a sell - out deal with Robert Mugabe 's ruling Zimbabwe African National Union - Patriotic Front ( ZANU - PF ) as a junior partner and that Mugabe was now ready to accept this .
Three years ago , we wrote :
The perspective of a government of national unity between the opposition and ZANU - PF is shared by the elites now dominant in the ruling party , in the two main opposition parties and local and international capitalists .
Their main efforts , despite current disagreements are driven towards achieving such goal , as an instrument in pre-empting social revolution in an important periphery capitalist state sent into mortal crisis by the failure of neo-liberal capitalism …
And that for the MDC :
Its primary preoccupation is towards reaching a sell - out agreement with the ZANU - PF dictatorship that will not benefit the poor and working people … ( that ) the opposition is dominated by the petite - bourgeois elite , who long ago prostrated themselves before Western neoliberal forces and are now eager to get into state power , even as junior partners , and accumulate as a neo -colonial dependent capitalist class .
And for ZANU - PF that :
ZANU - PF elites now want the peace to grow and launder the wealth acquired in the last decade but cannot do so in the context of a crisis ridden state under siege from the West… ( and that ) despite his rhetoric , Mugabe is now ready to capitulate and enter into an elitist compromise deal with the MDC , the West and business .
But only after the 2008 elections , which he hopes to use to legitimise his party ’s claim to being the senior partner …
Our warnings have now come to pass with MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai and the MDC agreeing to finally join Mugabe in a so - called “ all - inclusive government ” and parliament , unanimously passing Constituional Amendment # 19 and the massively neoliberal 2009 budget and monetary policy issued by the regime .
Under the deal Tsvangirai becomes prime minister while Mugabe chairs the Council of Ministers , with the opposition having 16 to ZANU - PF 's 15 ministers .
The deal mandates a constitutional reform process that will lead to a referendum and new constitution in 18 months ' time , overseen by a parliamentary select committee .
Understandably , many ordinary people out of desperation have welcomed the deal as possibly giving them some relief from their current suffering .
But despite this there are many reasons why working people must oppose the government of national unity ( GNU ) and continue with the struggle against the ZANU - PF dictatorship .
With time , as hardships accelerate under dollarisation and the neoliberal policies of the GNU , most people will come to oppose it .
Seven reasons to oppose a government of national unity , Constututional Amendment 19 and the draft constitution process
1 . The losers of the March 2008 elections retain most of the power , with Mugabe remaining the head of state and government and Tsvangirai , leader of the victorious party , reduced to slightly above a ceremonial role .
2. Mugabe remains in the driving seat and the MDC the junior spanner boy -- which is why the Western countries are unhappy .
Mugabe remains the head of state and government with authority to appoint ministers , chair cabinet , dissolve parliament , declare war , enter into international treaties , assent legislation , and appoint or dismiss key state officials like the service chiefs , judges , the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe governor , ambassadors and permanent secretaries .
This is why he has already reappointed Gideon Gono as the governor of the Reserve Bank for another five years .
All he is required to do is to consult the prime minister Tsvangiraibut not necessarily agree with him .
3 . The deal leaves Mugabe in charge of the key security ministries and state agencies and leaves the generals in the Joint Operations Command in power , meaning the ZANU - PF regime can always throw out the deal if it no longer suits it .
4. Decisions in cabinet have to be made by consensus , thereby neutralising the opposition 's numerical advantage .
5 . The GNU creates an overbloated and expensive coalition government and parliament with more than 50 ministers and deputy ministers , and nearly 300 MPs and senators when the country is facing its worst economic crisis .
So happy were MDC MPs with passing of amendment 19 , they were shouting tapinda tapinda ( `` We too are now in ' ' ) .
6 . The GNU is based on a neoliberal , free - market economic policy that will bring untold suffering to the working people while giving huge luxuries to the rich and the capitalists .
Adoption of such free - market policies is one of the fundamental preconditions demanded by the Western countries led by the USA and Britain to support the deal .
Both parties support this and already the regime has unleashed an all - out neoliberal war on the poor and working people through its 2009 national budget and monetary statement .
7 . The GNU is pushing an undemocratic , neoliberal and elitist constitution and constitutional process on Zimbabwe with a constitution written by politicians and the elites , with civic society and ordinary people reduced to a rubber - stamping role .
The political parties will fast track their draft constitution onto the people .
While massively protecting the interests of the rich and business , including the right to private property , it leaves out the labour , social economic rights of the ordinary people , such as the right to health , education , food , housing , and medicinal drugs and care for those affected with AIDS / HIV , and fair labour practices like the right to a living wage and the right to strike ; the right for traders to earn a living , including state support and freedom from police harassment .
Way forward : reject the GNU and draft constitution process
Although the elites have come up with a temporary ceasefire deal , their GNU is shaky politically and economically .
The ZANU - PF dictatorship is not interested in genuine powersharing , which is why it has reappointed its brutal economic czar , Reserve Bank governor Gono , for another five years , and retained so much power .
Economically , given the reluctant Western imperialist support and a growing world recession , the prospects for economic recovery remain slim , thereby perpetuating social and political tensions .
The ordinary people have no choice but to fight back against the massive attacks on their living conditions arising from dollarisation and liberalisation .
For these reasons , progressive social movements , trade unions , student unions and civic groups must not call for a ceasefire and must not have naïve illusions in the GNU deal or the constitution drafting process .
Some elitist and pro-MDC NGOs are trying to persuade , bribe and bulldoze civic society to give a chance to the GNU and its politician - driven constitutional process , saying we can improve on this .
We must reject this .
If the engine is defective , the car can never move .
The whole deal and the constitutional process stink and are anti-people .
They can not be improved .
Insist on the constitutional process laid out in the People 's Charter , which calls for a completely new people - driven ``All Stakeholders Conference ' ' , which will lay out the process for constitutional reform .
Now is not the time to patch up a bogus and anti-people deal , but to accelerate the struggles against the illegitimate regime and its neoliberal economic policies as is already being done by university students , teachers , lecturers and railway and water workers .
United we can overcome the dictatorship and convene fresh elections under a new democratic and people - driven constitution , one that brings both political democracy and addresses bread and butter demands of life as we have seen in constitutions won in Venezuela and Bolivia .
Such powerful reforms can set the foundations for the much more critical struggle against the very system of capitalism itself , which breeds poverty and dictatorship , and instead fight for true human emancipation , socialism .
But to ensure progress it is imperative that there is urgent regroupment in a united front of the radical , anti-neoliberal and left forces , including organised labour .
To avoid the treachery we experienced in the popular frontist People 's Convention , which was dominated by the imperialist - funded and - controlled groups , it is essential that there be a serious shake out and split between the militant , serious and pro-working people anti-neoliberal movements opposing the elitist constitution - drafting process and the opportunistic , cowardly and imperialist - funded and - controlled ones who want to hijack civic society movements to support the elitist and neoliberal GNU and draft constitution processes .

A 42 - year - old HIV patient with leukemia appears to have no detectable HIV in his blood and no symptoms after a stem cell transplant from a donor carrying a gene mutation that confers natural resistance to the virus that causes AIDS , according to a report published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine .
The patient underwent a stem cell transplant and since , has not tested positive for HIV in his blood .
" The patient is fine , " said Dr. Gero Hutter of Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin in Germany .
" Today , two years after his transplantation , he is still without any signs of HIV disease and without antiretroviral medication . "
The case was first reported in November , and the new report is the first official publication of the case in a medical journal .
Hutter and a team of medical professionals performed the stem cell transplant on the patient , an American living in Germany , to treat the man 's leukemia , not the HIV itself .
However , the team deliberately chose a compatible donor who has a naturally occurring gene mutation that confers resistance to HIV .
The mutation cripples a receptor known as CCR5 , which is normally found on the surface of T cells , the type of immune system cells attacked by HIV .
The mutation is known as CCR5 delta32 and is found in 1 percent to 3 percent of white populations of European descent .
HIV uses the CCR5 as a co-receptor ( in addition to CD4 receptors ) to latch on to and ultimately destroy immune system cells .
Since the virus can't gain a foothold on cells that lack CCR5 , people who have the mutation have natural protection .
( There are other , less common HIV strains that use different co-receptors . )
People who inherit one copy of CCR5 delta32 take longer to get sick or develop AIDS if infected with HIV .
People with two copies ( one from each parent ) may not become infected at all .
The stem cell donor had two copies .
While promising , the treatment is unlikely to help the vast majority of people infected with HIV , said Dr. Jay Levy , a professor at the University of California San Francisco , who wrote an editorial accompanying the study .
A stem cell transplant is too extreme and too dangerous to be used as a routine treatment , he said .
" About a third of the people die [ during such transplants ] , so it 's just too much of a risk , " Levy said .
To perform a stem cell transplant , doctors intentionally destroy a patient 's immune system , leaving the patient vulnerable to infection , and then reintroduce a donor 's stem cells ( which are from either bone marrow or blood ) in an effort to establish a new , healthy immune system .
Levy also said it 's unlikely that the transplant truly cured the patient in this study .
HIV can infect many other types of cells and may be hiding out in the patient 's body to resurface at a later time , he said .
" This type of virus can infect macrophages ( another type of white blood cell that expresses CCR5 ) and other cells , like the brain cells , and it could live a lifetime .
But if it can't spread , you never see it -- but it 's there and it could do some damage , " he said .
" It 's not the kind of approach that you could say , ' I 've cured you . '
I 've eliminated the virus from your body . "

Before undergoing the transplant , the patient was also found to be infected with low levels of a type of HIV known as X4 , which does not use the CCR5 receptor to infect cells .
So it would seem that this virus would still be able to grow and damage immune cells in his body .
However , following the transplant , signs of leukemia and HIV were absent .
" There is no really conclusive explanation why we did n't observe any rebound of HIV , " Hutter said .
" This finding is very surprising . "
Hutter noted that one year ago , the patient had a relapse of leukemia and a second transplant from the same donor .
The patient experienced complications from the procedure , including temporary liver problems and kidney failure , but they were not unusual and may occur in HIV - negative patients , he said .
Researchers including Hutter agree that the technique should not be used to treat HIV alone .
" Some people may say , ' I want to do it , ' " said Levy .
A more logical -- and potentially safer -- approach would be to develop some type of CCR5 - disabling gene therapy or treatment that could be directly injected into the body , said Levy .
Less invasive options to alter CCR5 could be on the horizon within the next five years , said Levy .
" It 's definitely the wave of the future , " he said .
" As we continue to follow this one patient , we will learn a lot . "
One drug that 's currently on the market that blocks CCR5 is called maraviroc ( Selzentry ) .
It was first approved in 2007 and is used in combination with other antiretroviral drugs .

" I think we will have to think very hard about building up our manufacturing base .
It 's not old fashioned – many factories are cutting edge – and we have to accept that if we want economic growth it can't come from financial services , " she said .
An open letter to Hazel Blears MP , secretary of state for communities and local government .
Last week you used an article in the Guardian to attack my " cynical and corrosive commentary " .
You asserted your political courage , maintaining that " you do n't get very far in politics without guts , and certainly not as far as the cabinet table " .
By contrast , you suggested , I contribute " to the very cynicism and disengagement from politics " that I make my living writing about .
You accused me of making claims without supporting evidence and of " wielding great influence without accountability " .
" We need more people standing for office and serving their communities , " you wrote , " more people debating , engaging and voting ; not more people waving placards on the sidelines . "
Quite so .
But being the placard - waving sort , I have a cynical and corrosive tendency to mistrust the claims ministers make about themselves .
Like you , I believe opinions should be based on evidence .
So I have decided to test your statements against the record .
Courage in politics is measured by the consistent application of principles .
The website TheyWorkForYou.com records votes on key issues since 2001 .
It reveals that you voted " very strongly for the Iraq war " , " very strongly against an investigation into the Iraq war " and " very strongly for replacing Trident " ( " very strongly " means an unbroken record ) .
You have voted in favour of detaining terror suspects without charge for 42 days , in favour of identity cards and in favour of a long series of bills curtailing the freedom to protest .
There 's certainly consistency here , though it is not clear what principles you are defending .
Other threads are harder to follow .
In 2003 , for instance , you voted against a fully elected House of Lords and in favour of a chamber of appointed peers .
In 2007 , you voted for a fully elected House of Lords .
You have served without public complaint in a government which has introduced the minimum wage but blocked employment rights for temporary and agency workers ; which talked of fiscal prudence but deregulated the financial markets ; which passed the Climate Change Act but approved the construction of a third runway at Heathrow ; which spoke of an ethical foreign policy but launched an illegal war in which perhaps a million people have died .
Either your principles , by some remarkable twists of fate , happen to have pre-empted every contradictory decision this government has taken , or you do n't possess any .
You remained silent while the government endorsed the kidnap and the torture of innocent people ; blocked a ceasefire in Lebanon and backed a dictator in Uzbekistan who boils his prisoners to death .
You voiced no public concern while it instructed the Serious Fraud Office to drop the corruption case against BAE , announced a policy of pre-emptive nuclear war , signed a one - sided extradition treaty with the United States and left our citizens to languish in Guantánamo Bay .
You remained loyal while it oversaw the stealthy privatisation of our public services and the collapse of Britain 's social housing programme , closed hundreds of post offices and shifted taxation from the rich to the poor .
What exactly do you stand for Hazel , except election ?
The only consistent political principle I can deduce from these positions is slavish obedience to your masters .
TheyWorkForYou sums up your political record thus : " Never rebels against their party in this parliament . "
Yours , Hazel , is the courage of the sycophant , the courage to say yes .
Let me remind you just how far your political " guts " have carried you .
You are temporarily protected by the fact that the United Kingdom , unlike other states , has not yet incorporated the Nuremberg principles into national law .
If a future government does so , you and all those who remained in the cabinet on 20 March 2003 will be at risk of prosecution for what the Nuremberg tribunal called " the supreme international crime " .
This is defined as the " planning , preparation , initiation or waging of a war of aggression " .
Robin Cook , a man of genuine political courage , put his conscience ahead of his career and resigned .
What did you do ?
It seems to me that someone of your principles would fit comfortably into almost any government .
All regimes require people like you , who seem to be prepared to obey orders without question .
Unwavering obedience guarantees success in any administration .
It also guarantees collaboration in every atrocity in which a government might engage .
The greatest thing we have to fear in politics is the cowardice of politicians .
You demanded evidence that consultations and citizens ' juries have been rigged .
You 've got it .
In 2007 , the high court ruled that the government 's first consultation on nuclear power was " seriously flawed " and " unlawful " .
It also ruled that the government must commission an opinion poll .
The poll the government launched was reviewed by the Market Research Standards Board .
It found that " information was inaccurately or misleadingly presented , or was imbalanced , which gave rise to a material risk of respondents being led towards a particular answer " .
As freedom of information requests made by Greenpeace reveal , the consultation over the third runway at Heathrow used faked noise and pollution figures .
It was repeatedly pre-empted by ministers announcing that the runway would be built .
Nor did the government leave anything to chance when it wanted to set up giant health centres , or polyclinics , run by GPs .
As Dr Tony Stanton of the Londonwide Local Medical Committees has pointed out , " a week before a £ 1 m consultation on polyclinics and hospitals by NHS London closed , London 's 31 primary care trusts were issued with instructions on setting up polyclinic pilots and GP - led health centres " .
Consultations elsewhere claimed that there was no need to discuss whether or not new health centres were required , as the principle had already been established through " extensive national level consultation exercises " .
But no such exercises had taken place ; just a handful of citizens ' juries engaging a total of a thousand selected people and steered by government ministers .
Those who were n't chosen had no say .
Fixes like this might give you some clues about why more people are not taking part in politics .
I believe there is a vast public appetite for re-engagement , but your government , aware of the electoral consequences , has shut us out .
It has reneged on its promise to hold a referendum on electoral reform .
It has blocked a referendum on the European treaty , ditched the regional assemblies , used Scottish MPs to swing English votes , sustained an unelected House of Lords , eliminated almost all the differences between itself and the opposition .
You create an impenetrable political monoculture , then moan that people do n't engage in politics .
It is precisely because I can picture something better that I have become such a cynical old git .
William Hazlitt remarked that : " Man is the only animal that laughs and weeps ; for he is the only animal that is struck with the difference between what things are and what they ought to be . "
You , Hazel , have helped to reduce our political choices to a single question : whether to laugh through our tears or weep through our laughter .

Way back in August of 2007 , Barack Obama having declared he was a candidate for the Presidency of the United States , some “ reporter ” asked him whether he would be willing to use nuclear weapons , either in the War on Terror or to prevent " nuclear proliferation " by those dirty Mullahs .
To the absolute delight of ( a ) Dubya the Dimwit , ( b ) Bomb - Bomb - Iran McCain and ( c ) Hillary the Chicken - Hawk , candidate Obama replied ;
" I think it would be a profound mistake for us to use nuclear weapons in any circumstance  involving civilians .
Let me scratch that .
There ’s been no discussion of [ using ] nuclear weapons .
That ’s not on the table . "
Actually , the use of nuclear weapons against civilians has long been " on the table , " going back to 1945 , when President Truman deliberately murdered many hundreds of thousands of Japanese , apparently as a warning to Joseph Stalin to halt further Soviet occupation of territories in both Europe and Asia .
Or Else !
And , according to Adm .
Mike Mullen , the holdover Bush - Cheney Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , when asked by the Jerusalem Post last week whether the potential for military action against Iran had changed , Mullen replied " I do n’t think the new administration has taken any options off the table , including military force . "
Leaving aside the propriety of the Chairman of our Joint Chiefs of Staff even responding to questions put to him about Obama - Biden policy by journalists  particularly Israeli journalists  how did President Obama ’s press - secretary respond when asked for clarification of Mullen ’s remarks ?
" In tackling Tehran ’s nuclear ambitions , alleged support for terrorism and threats against Israel , " White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said " we must use all elements of our national power [ including , apparently , our use of nukes against those who do n’t have nukes ] to protect our interests as it relates to Iran . "
Hey , why not ?
If nuking hundreds of thousands of totally innocent women and children enabled Truman to protect our interests as it related to Joe Stalin , maybe it ’ll work for Obama .
If you ’re wondering how Truman came to nuke all those helpless civilians in August , 1945 , barely three months after he discovered  upon succeeding FDR as President  that we were close to developing such a thing , you might check out a truly remarkable American Experience documentary , entitled The Trials of J. Robert Oppenheimer , originally broadcast just last week .
Of course , the documentary is only tangentially about Truman and his fatally flawed understandings of what nukes ( to say nothing of thermo - nukes ) were , how they worked and what  if anything  they were good for .
As the documentary makes clear , Oppenheimer served as the indispensable Director of the Los Alamos team , which , as a result of about a year ’s intensive effort , designed and successfully tested the first implosion fission device , which utilized a near - critical mass of almost pure Plutonium - 239 .
Truman and others believed ( falsely ) that if only we kept secret what Oppenheimer and his extraordinary team had done , Russian scientists would never be able to duplicate it .
What the documentary does not make clear  perhaps deliberately  was that there were two very different nukes developed .
" Little Boy , " the nuke Truman dropped on Hiroshima , was not all that difficult to develop .
In fact , they never even bothered to test it .
Simplicity , itself , a 60 pound projectile of almost - pure Uranium - 235 was propelled down a gun-barrel at another 60 pound target of almost - pure Uranium - 235 .
The principal difficulty in producing such a nuke was in producing hundreds of pounds of almost - pure Uranium - 235 , and Oppenheimer had almost nothing to do with that production .
( It is interesting to note that metallurgist A.Q. Khan  sometimes referred to incorrectly as the Father of Pakistan ’s nuclear bomb  had everything to do with the production of hundreds of pounds of almost - pure Uranium - 235 , and almost nothing to do with the design and testing of the bomb , itself . )
Now , for various reasons , no one who can make an implosion - type nuke , requiring only a few pounds of almost - pure Plutonium - 239 , ever bothers to design , test , produce and stockpile Uranium - 235 gun - type nukes .
And when the Russians did test their first nuke , in 1949 , it was a Plutonium - 239 implosion - type nuke , apparently very similar to the one we first tested in 1945 .
So , Truman and others concluded ( falsely ) that the Russians must have stolen the design from us .
Consequently , the reasoning went , if we improved our security and then went ahead  as Edward Teller and others urged  to develop the so - called " Super , " which was to use a Plutonium - 239 implosion - nuke as a trigger , to ignite a thermonuclear explosion , then the stupid Russians would disappear , permanently , from our rearview mirror .
How to improve security ?
Well , get rid of all those Commie spies , in every closet and under every bed .
And above all , get rid of Oppenheimer .
Robert Oppenheimer had openly consorted with known members of the Communist Party in the 1930s , his mistress was a member , his brother Frank was a member and Frank ’s wife was also a member .
Now , Robert Oppenheimer had always opposed Teller ’s " Super , " primarily on the grounds that it would not be  could not be  militarily useful .
There were no targets for such a doomsday device .
( Oppenheimer has basically been vindicated for having this view .
Although we could easily have 100 - Megaton yield nukes in our stockpile , most of them are less than a thousandth of that . )
Anyway , in October 1952 , we tested a two stage thermonuclear device ( sited on a small island in the Pacific , which ceased to exist ) , reportedly weighing a total of 82 tons , and having a yield of about 10 megatons .
But would n’t you just know it .
Just 3 years later those pesky Russians tested their first thermonuclear device , having a yield of 1.6 Megatons .
However , here ’s the kicker  they dropped theirs from an aircraft !
Obviously , their TN - weapon did n’t weigh 82 tons , and you can bet your sweet bippy they did n’t steal the secret on how to make it deliverable by aircraft from us .
In fact , it was only after we studied the rad -chem fallout that we figured out what their secret was .
Okay , so Truman was about as wrong about nukes as any President could possibly be .
The option of nuking civilians should never have been on the table then , and if Obama really wants " change we can believe in , " he should take it off the table .
And the sooner the better .
Сейм Литвы одобрил предложение оппозиции временно на 15 % урезать зарплату президента страны , а также высших государственных чиновников категории так называемого политического доверия – премьера , спикера , вице- министров и ряда других .
Одобренный депутатами проект в ближайшие дни должен быть поставлен на голосование .
Согласно предложению , это была бы « временная , действующая до конца текущего года мера , принимаемая с учетом сложной экономической ситуации » .
Зарплату президента Валдаса Адамкуса , срок полномочий которого истекает в июле этого года , решено не трогать .
« Оставим право выбора за президентом » , — сказал , представляя проект , парламентарий Витаутас Гапшис .
Ранее Адамкус заявлял , что готов , если это поможет преодолению экономического кризиса , отказаться от части жалованья .
Президентская зарплата « на бумаге » равна в Литве 25 тыс. литов ( 7,25 тыс.евро ) в месяц .
Примерно треть из этой суммы надо вычесть на налоги .
( Fortune Magazine ) -- Arkady Volozh , CEO of Yandex , Russia 's largest online - search company , is playing with a set of nesting dolls ( for real ! ) .
Instead of the traditional folk decoration , though , these figurines are outfitted with the names of Internet companies doing business in Russia .
The first and biggest doll has Yandex emblazoned on its belly in bold red and black letters .
A smaller doll bears the Google logo , followed by one representing Rambler , Russia 's other homegrown search engine .
" We were charitable with these dolls , " Volozh says .
" If we had been honest , we would have left the second doll blank and made Google third .
We 're that much bigger than them . "
Having conquered search in Russia , Yandex is setting its sights on the U.S. The Moscow - based company is opening Yandex Labs not far from Google ( GOOG , Fortune 500 ) headquarters in Mountain View , Calif .
Volozh says he 'll staff the office with 20 or so engineers to index Web pages for a Russian audience and keep abreast of technology developments that bubble up in Silicon Valley .
Volozh certainly will be going after some of the same tech superstars Google recruits , but some wonder whether Yandex has grander ambitions , including a play for some of Google 's U.S. market share .
One possibility : grabbing part of the growing market for image searches .
Volozh denies that he 's chasing Google .
In fact , Yandex , which got its start in the late 1980s , long before Google founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page had even met , arguably has the superior search technology .
Yandex 's search algorithm is rooted in the highly inflected and very peculiar Russian language .
Words can take on some 20 different endings to indicate their relationship to one another , and " while this makes the language precise , " says MIT linguistics professor David Pesetsky , " it makes search extremely difficult . "
Google fetches the exact word combination you enter into the search bar , leaving out the slightly different forms that mean similar things .
Yandex has found a way to catch them all .
As a result , Yandex controls 56 % of the search market in Russia ( compared with Google 's 23 % ) , boasts an impressive two - thirds of all revenue from so - called search ads , and draws more than three billion hits a month .
Last month Firefox dropped Google as its default search engine in Russia in favor of Yandex , putting Yandex on track to conquer still more of the market .
And Yandex ( short for " yet another indexer " ) continues to innovate .
While some of its services are similar to offerings available in the U.S. ( blog rankings , online banking ) , it also has developed some applications that only Russians can enjoy , such as an image search engine that eliminates repeated images , a portrait filter that ferrets out faces in an image search , and a real - time traffic report that taps into users ' roving cellphone signals to monitor how quickly people are moving through crowded roads in more than a dozen Russian cities .
Says noted venture capitalist and Yandex board member Esther Dyson : " What I love about Volozh is that he 's never been complacent . "
Volozh has aspired to run a transparent operation from the beginning , stocking his board with reputable folks like Dyson and forgoing the favor - seeking that is common in Moscow .
Indeed , the fact that the SEC gave Yandex the green light to list on Nasdaq says a lot , according Nasdaq managing director Paulina McGroarty .
" It shows that the management was ready to show the world that they have that stamp of approval , " she says .
Changing plans
The financial crisis derailed Yandex 's IPO plans , but it has helped the company stay clear of some of the Kremlin - connected oligarchs who had wanted to buy in : Industrialist Alisher Usmanov was set to take a 10 % stake in Yandex , but the meltdown of the Russian market has forced the controversial businessman to rethink his investments .
Volozh says his company is cash - flow positive , and as a result it does n't need to raise more money right now .
Yandex 's growth certainly has been impressive : Revenue has doubled every year since 2000 , and last year reported sales topped $ 300 million .
According to Volozh , Yandex has turned down repeated buyout offers from Yahoo ( YHOO , Fortune 500 ) , Microsoft ( MSFT , Fortune 500 ) and Google .
( The companies declined to comment . )
Analysts value the business at about $ 6 billion .
While Yandex may not be interested in serving American customers , Google is definitely eager to increase market share in Russia , which boasts the fastest - growing Internet population in Europe .
Google struggled when it first began making Russian - language search available in 2001 , largely because its technology failed to take into account the complexities of Russian grammar .
Its market share for much of the decade hovered at a tepid 6 % .
Then , in 2006 , Google hired a few dozen Russian engineers to address the language issues , and its market share jumped instantly .
With its huge potential for growth , says Alla Zabrovskaya , who heads public relations for Google in Moscow , " Russia is a pivotal country for Google . "
As the market leader , Yandex has momentum on its side , but Volozh believes the company 's real edge in Russia is its local roots .
" We can joke in Russian , which Google can't do , " Volozh told Fortune during a meeting at Yandex 's California offices .
Two years ago , for example , Yandex hosted a televised live chat with then - President Vladimir Putin .
The company insisted that the President answer users ' most popular questions and forgo the Kremlin 's usual scripted format .
" When did you have sex for the first time ? " was one of the most popular , and Putin had to respond .
" I do n't remember , but I certainly remember the last , " he quipped .
" I can pinpoint it down to the minute . "
The home - team advantage should help Yandex maintain its market share in Russia , but it also puts a lot of pressure on the company .
If Yandex were to stumble , that would be a disappointment to Russia , which , despite its highly educated population , has few successful homegrown tech companies to root for .
And Volozh might even have to order a new set of nesting dolls .

IRVINE , Calif . 
A new federal law aimed at protecting children from lead in toys has also forced a nationwide halt in sales of off - road motorcycles and recreational vehicles built for young riders , killing off a multimillion - dollar industry that was thriving despite the recession .
Thousands of powersports dealers were told to halt sales of vehicles designed for children 12 and younger because of new lead restrictions in an act of Congress that took effect Feb. 10 .
Even used vehicle sales are banned by law passed in response to lead found in toys imported from China .
" We 're out of business as far as the youth market goes , " says Rick Rizzon , owner of Rizzon Cycle in Middlesex , N.J. " It 's crazy . "
With the motor vehicle industry already hurting from recession , he said the ban means a 20 % drop in sales of youth off - road motorcycles and the parts business for bikes already sold .
The ban hits California especially hard .
Off - roading is hugely popular among families in the state and several state parks are devoted to dirt riding .
Kevin Matty , finance director at Temecula Motorsports in Temecula , Calif. , ( where the desert is a big draw for dirt bikers ) estimates the ban will wipe out half of his business sales .
" I thought it was a joke , " Matty said , until the manufacturers told him he had to take the youth vehicles off the showroom floor .
Economic repercussions Passed by Congress after a series of reports concerning toys made in China with lead , the law bans sale of products aimed at children if they contain more than 600 parts per million of lead , says Joseph Martyak , chief of staff to the acting chairman of the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission .
Lead is found in steel and other metal alloys in the frame , motor and multiple other parts , said Paul Vitrano , general counsel for the Motorcycle Industry Council .
The lead strengthens the metals and resists corrosion .
Supporters of the law hailed its passage in August .
Rep. John Conyers , D - Mich. , a bill co-sponsor , said at the time that supporting the law " is a vote for industry accountability , regulatory integrity , and most importantly , child safety . "
Martyak said the wording of the law left the commission no choice but to enforce the ban on youth cycles and ATVs even with no evidence children would ingest or absorb the items .
The industry has petitioned the commission for an exemption .
The ban will have repercussions economically .
The Motorcycle Industry Council estimates nearly 100,000 youth bikes were sold in the USA in 2008 , though some were aimed at kids 13 and older and not covered by the ban .
Dealernews , an industry trade publication , estimates that the value of inventory at U.S. dealers that can no longer be sold probably exceeds $ 100 million .
Beyond current inventory , Kawasaki spokeswoman Jan Plessner said the company has " millions and millions of dollars " worth of parts now in the product pipeline to dealers that can not be sold .
Most cycles and ATVs are made overseas , but there are tens of thousands of jobs attached to the industry here .
More than 13,000 powersports dealers sell products in the United States , according to the Motorcycle Industry Council , employing an estimated 124,000 people .
Vitrano says the industry estimates the retail market value for all off - road cycles and ATVs is $ 14.5 billion a year , including sales , service , parts , accessories and payroll .
' Are you kidding ? '
Children appeared perplexed by the ban .
" Are you kidding ?
This is silly , " says Zack Bartell , 12 , who was taking a dirt - bike riding lesson at School for Dirt 's track next to Kawasaki Motors ' U.S. headquarters here .
" There 's no way I 'm going to stick a motorcycle part in my mouth . "
The 12 - and - under market is a huge focus for the industry because it believes children who ride will grow up to be adult riders and consumers as well .
It builds bikes with single - cylinder motors as small as 50 cc that fit children .
Children as young as Karsyn Boyd , who said she was " 6 and a quarter , " were riding with ease after an hour or so of instruction , carving figure eights , traversing hills and cutting around orange cones .
Vitrano says the ban will have a perverse effect :
Rather than no longer riding , kids who can't get a cycle their size may hop on a bike made for older children or adults — one inappropriate and dangerous for a smaller child .
Terry Dempsey , sales manager at Long Beach Motorsports in Long Beach , Calif. , said he sold $ 120,000 worth of youth bikes last year , plus more in parts , service and accessories .
" We 're already down 30 % ( from recession ) , and now we just lost another 10 % to 15 % of our customer base , " Dempsey says .
The economy notwithstanding , enthusiasts say the ban needlessly kills a family - oriented sport where children ride with their moms and dads and , like other sports , can induce children to behave .
" I know if I keep my grades up , I can keep riding , " says Zack , who started riding at age 5 .

Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad will deliver Channel 4's alternative to the Queen 's Christmas Day speech this year , it has announced .
He will be shown telling British viewers " the general will of nations " is for a return to " human values " .
His speech , in Farsi with English subtitles , will be the channel 's 16th alternative Christmas message .
Unlike previous years , it will be broadcast at night and not at the same time as the Queen 's speech .
The message of seasonal goodwill is to be aired at 1915 GMT .
' Alternative view '
In his speech , Mr Ahmadinejad congratulates the people of Britain on the anniversary of the birth of Jesus Christ .
As the leader of one of the most powerful states in the Middle East , President Ahmadinejad 's views are enormously influential
Dorothy Byrne
Channel 4
He says that problems in society are rooted in the rejection of the message of the prophets of God , including Jesus .
And he criticises the " indifference of some governments and powers " towards the teachings of " the divine prophets " .
Channel 4 head of news and current affairs Dorothy Byrne said : " As the leader of one of the most powerful states in the Middle East , President Ahmadinejad 's views are enormously influential .
" As we approach a critical time in international relations , we are offering our viewers an insight into an alternative world view . "
' Divisive denial ' But Stephen Smith , director of the Holocaust Centre in Newark , Nottinghamshire , criticised Mr Ahmadinejad 's " benign " message as " deception " .
" This message of so - called peace needs to be treated very carefully , " he said .
A speech Mr Ahmadinejad gave in December 2005 , in which he referred to the Holocaust as " the myth of the Jews ' massacre " , angered Jewish groups .
Mr Smith criticised " the fact that somebody who openly denies the Holocaust is given legitimacy on prime time television , someone who uses Holocaust denial to be divisive " .
In spite of his ridiculous and often offensive views , it is an important way of reminding him that there are some countries where free speech is not repressed
Ben Summerskill
Stonewall Mr Ahmadinejad has also been criticised for the treatment of gay people in Iran .
Last year , when asked in a visit to New York 's Columbia University about the execution of gay people in Iran , he replied : " In Iran we do n't have homosexuals like in your country . "
Gay rights group Stonewall said Mr Ahmadinejad should " celebrate the fact that he can appear on television to give a message like this " .
" In spite of his ridiculous and often offensive views , it is an important way of reminding him that there are some countries where free speech is not repressed , " director Ben Summerskill said .
Channel 4's first alternative message was delivered by gay icon Quentin Crisp in 1993 .
Others to have given the broadcast include French actress Brigitte Bardot , former X Factor judge Sharon Osbourne and TV chef Jamie Oliver .
Last year 's message was given by Sgt Maj Andrew Stockton , a British soldier who lost an arm fighting in Afghanistan .

It ’s no use lying to ourselves .
The state of California is no longer safe .
Its government has assumed the likeness of something inimical .
It is “ progressive , ” having turned to the “ left . ”
It has put out the welcome mat for La Raza ( UnidosUS ) , Antifa , and the People ’s Liberation Army .
The state appears to be run by Marxists .
Should that surprise us ?
California ’s business and political elites are tied to Beijing .
San Francisco , with its many homeless encampments , is part Chinese colony and part liberal zoo .
Meanwhile , Los Angeles is becoming a foreign city .
During a research trip to Puerto Rico , ecologist James Porter took samples from underwater nuclear bomb target USS Killen , expecting to find evidence of radioactive matter - instead he found a link to cancer .
Data revealed that the closer corals and marine life were to unexploded bombs from the World War II vessel and the surrounding target range , the higher the rates of carcinogenic materials .
" Unexploded bombs are in the ocean for a variety of reasons - some were duds that did not explode , others were dumped in the ocean as a means of disposal , " said Porter .
" And we now know that these munitions are leaking cancer - causing materials and endangering sea life . "
These findings will be presented at the Second International Dialogue on Underwater Munitions on February 25 - 27 in Honolulu .
Data has been gathered since 1999 on the eastern end of the Isla de Vieques , Puerto Rico - a land and sea area that was used as a naval gunnery and bombing range from 1943 - 2003 .
Research revealed that marine life including reef - building corals , feather duster worms and sea urchins closest to the bomb and bomb fragments had the highest levels of toxicity .
In fact , carcinogenic materials were found in concentrations up to 100,000 times over established safe limits .
This danger zone covered a span of up to two meters from the bomb and its fragments .
According to research conducted in Vieques , residents here have a 23 % higher cancer rate than do Puerto Rican mainlanders .
Porter said a future step will be " to determine the link from unexploded munitions to marine life to the dinner plate . "
While Porter believes every nation with a coastline has problems with unexploded munitions , there is a solution .
" With the creation of the Ordinance Recovery System , we now have a way to safely remove unexploded munitions , " he said .
The machine picks up unexploded bombs off the sea floor and delivers them safely to a lift basket for surface disposal or deep sea burial .
It is operated remotely with proportional toggle switches that allow much more fine control of the delicate undersea operation than an on / off button .
The system relies on an underwater hydraulic system designed James Barton , president of Underwater Ordinance Recovery , Inc. , with the technical expertise of machinists at the UGA instrument shop .
" When you remove the bomb , you remove the problem - but you 've got to pick it up , " said Porter .

ABC officially announced the cast list for Season 8 of their reality TV showand Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak is listed amongst the contestants for this year 's show .
A Silicon Valley icon and philanthropist for the past three decades , Steve Wozniak , a.k.a.
" The Woz , " helped shape the computer industry with his design of Apple 's first line of products , the Apple I and II , and influenced the popular Macintosh .
After leaving Apple Computer Inc. in 1985 , Wozniak was involved in various business and philanthropic ventures , focusing primarily on computer capabilities in schools and stressing hands - on learning and encouraging creativity for students .
In 2000 , he was inducted into the Inventors Hall of Fame and was awarded the prestigious Heinz Award for Technology , The Economy and Employment .
Wozniak is also a published author with the release of his New York Times Best Selling autobiography , iWoz : From Computer Geek to Cult Icon , in September 2006 .
Dancing with the Stars is a " reality " - based competition in which stars are paired with professional dancers to compete in various styles of ballroom dancing .
At home viewers vote for their favorite dancing couple by phone .
Steve Wozniak along with Steve Jobs co-founded Apple , Inc. Wozniak was the engineer behind many of the early Apple computer designs .
While he is said to remain an official employee of Apple , Wozniak plays no role in the day to day operations of the company .
Dancing with the Stars premieres on ABC on Monday , March 9th at 8 p.m .
Likewise , Bank of America was well aware of the $ 3.2 billion in bonuses that Merrill paid to its rank and file in late December .
The two companies had agreed in September that Merrill might pay up to $ 5.8 billion , according to a private agreement reviewed by The New York Times .
Several weeks after that agreement was struck , a top deputy to Mr. Lewis met with Mr. Thain and asked him to lower the bonus pool below $ 3.5 billion and to increase the portion paid in cash .
Mr. Thain agreed to do so , according to two people familiar with the meeting .
Mr. Thain , meanwhile , lobbied for a bonus of his own until December , according to people familiar with his board discussions .
The initial $ 40 million suggestion floated on his behalf was no longer viable and Mr. Thain himself suggested a figure of $ 5 million to $ 10 million .
After that number was pilloried in public , he formally asked the board to award him nothing .
On Dec. 9 , Mr. Thain flew to Charlotte to attend Bank of America ’s board meeting , where Merrill ’s financial results through November were presented .
Already 60 percent of Merrill ’s losses were visible , but neither Mr. Lewis nor his board questioned Mr. Thain about the losses , according to a person close to Mr. Thain .
Mr. Lewis did not immediately disclose the losses to his shareholders , who had voted to approve the merger just days before .
Mr. Lewis later said that the losses greatly accelerated in mid-December , which caught him off guard .
On Friday , James Mahoney , a Bank of America spokesman said that “ we have not disputed that we were kept informed about the financial condition of the company . ”
During the last two weeks of December , while Mr. Thain was skiing in Vail , Mr. Lewis told federal regulators that he was thinking of backing out of the deal because of the losses .
Government officials , according to Mr. Lewis , told him he had to complete the deal in order to keep markets calm .
But Mr. Lewis did not tell Mr. Thain about his talks with the government until Jan. 5 , according to a person close to Mr. Thain .
AS the merger closed , and a new year began , Mr. Thain was prepared to take on a leadership role at Bank of America , even though several of his top deputies , longtime Merrill leaders , began leaving the bank themselves .
Mr. Lewis , battered by analyst questions about the wisdom of the Merrill takeover , became disenchanted with Mr. Thain .
In mid-January , he met with Mr. Thain at Merrill ’s downtown headquarters .
After a five - minute meeting , Mr. Thain was out .
Furious , Mr. Thain paced the halls of Merrill , venting his frustration to at least two people .
“ I do n’t know how these people can run this company without me , ” he told them .
Beginner 's Guide to the New World Order Published on : February 14th , 2009 Modified on : February 14th , 2009
" THIS IS NOT CORE OF CORRUPTION , but this is made by the same filmmaker .
A mini documentary about the New World Order written and directed by Jonathan Elinoff from Loose Change , details the basic understanding and evidence to introduce someone unfamiliar with the information .
Jonathan 's film series , Core of Corruption , is sometimes featured and the expected release date for that series is March 27th , 2009 .
Another film you might remember Elinoff from is RAW : Republicans Against the War which was another mini-doc released exclusively online , also available on this channel " ( categories : )
Clojure is a LISP - style language for the JVM .
One focus of Clojure is concurrency , which it supports with its immutable its data structures ( Clojure comes with persistent data structures ) .
Another feature is Software Transactional Memory ( STM ) , which allows to use transactions , instead of Locks or Mutexes , to update shared memory .
While STM is a controversial technology that still needs to prove itself , having access to an implementation on the JVM offers an easy way to experiment with it .
Clojure is expected to have a 1.0 release in the near future , and a lot of Clojure libraries are already available .
Some of them take inspiration from Ruby libraries , just to name a few :
Compojure is a Clojure web framework which , according to its README , was inspired by the Ruby web framework Sinatra .
Ring is a way to offer HTTP services , similar to Python 's WSGI and Ruby 's Rack .
clj - record is an ActiveRecord - like ORM mapper .
Lancet is a Clojure build tool , like Rake , by Stuart Halloway
clj - haml is a port of Ruby 's HAML library .
Clojure libraries inspired by Ruby libraries are one way the two languages interact .
Another way is JRuby - the two languages share the same underlying runtime , the JVM .
Daniel Kwiecinski explores the idea of combining JRuby and Clojure in a blog entry and experiments with making Clojure data structures and features available in JRuby as Ruby objects .
Particularly interesting in this regard are Clojure 's Persistent Data Structures , for instance its Persistent Vectors .
Note :
In this context , the word " persistent " does n't refer to data being persisted to disk .
Persisted Data Structures are immutable ; modifications , like insertions , are possible but they always yield a new " copy " of the full data structure .
Clojure 's implementation and the immutability constraint allow to avoid having to do a full deep copy ; instead , only a relatively small delta has to be copied .
Karl Krukow shows the implementation of Clojure 's Persistent Vector , and explains how it achieves its performance behavior .
Another opportunity for JRuby developers is Clojure 's STM support , which is offers a way for Ruby developers to experiment with this concept .
Even if the Ruby code does n't explcitly use any particular Clojure STM features , it 's still possible to write the underlying application model in Clojure , and have JRuby for the fronted part , be it from Rails or other Ruby frameworks .
Another option is to use Clojure for performance bottlenecks .
While JRuby 's performance is steadily improving , there are still situations where it'd be nice to exchange ( J ) Ruby 's polymorphmism and flexibility for performance .
In MRI , performance bottlenecks in a Ruby application can be fixed by writing a native extension .
In JRuby , one solution is to write code in Java , be it Java source code or a way to generate JVM bytecode ( either bytecode generation with a Ruby bytecode DSL or a language like Charles Nutters ' Duby ) .
Choosing a lower level , system language , be it C ( for MRI ) or Java ( for JRuby ) has an obvious downside : dropping down to the level of Java and losing features such as Blocks , many types of metaprogramming , etc .
Clojure is a possible solution for this problem : the language has various levels of flexbility .
For instance , normal Clojure functions have low call overhead as they 're mostly reduced to static method calls .
Clojure does offer different styles of runtime polymorphism , for instance in the form of multimethods .
Clojure is a LISP and comes with a powerful macro system .
Macros allow compile time metaprogramming , which brings even more opportunities to offload code generation to the computer ( instead of writing boilerplate or repetitive code in Java by hand ) .
Clojure code is always compiled to JVM bytecode , Ahead Of Time ( AOT ) compilation is also supported .
Azul 's Cliff Click took a closer look at the performance of some JVM languages , including Clojure and JRuby and provides some information about Clojure 's performance .
All in all , Clojure offers a lot of opportunities to write fast code in an elegant style .
The other side of the medal is of course a matter of dependencies : using Clojure means another new dependency to a project .
Whether it's a good idea to add another , still little known , language like Clojure to a project , is a question every team has to answer .
The STM solution to concurrency and shared data has been widely debated .
Clojure creator Rich Hickey had a long discussion with Azul 's Cliff Click on the topic of STM .
Another source of information about STM is last September 's ACMQueue issue on Concurrency .
What do you think : JRuby and Clojure - a good match ?
It is Damien Hirst with a bloody hole in his head – the richest bad boy of British art finally turned into a piece of half - pickled art himself .
Spanish artist Eugenio Merino 's sculpture , which shows a Hirst figure pointing a gun at himself and blowing his own brains out , is meant to be a comment on the British artist 's own £ 50 m diamond - studded skull , For the Love of God .
Merino has called his piece " 4 the Love of Go(l ) d " , suggesting that Hirst 's attempts to increase the value of his own work would only be enhanced by his own death .
" I thought that , given that he thinks so much about money , his next work could be that he shot himself .
Like that the value of his work would increase dramatically , " Merino told The Guardian .
" Obviously , though , he would not be around to enjoy it . "
Merino 's work , displayed in the sort of glass case that Hirst likes to fill with formaldehyde and dead animals , has been on display at Madrid 's ARCO art fair .
" It is a joke but it is also paradoxical that if he did kill himself his work would be worth even more , " said Merino .
" That is a metaphor for the current state of the art world . "
Merino said that many people thought the work meant that he hated Damien Hirst , when in fact he was a great admirer .
" I am a fan .
I studied him at art school .
I 'm just adding my own little grain of sand , " said Merino , who devoted the rest of his ARCO show to parodies of Hirst 's work .
These included a football split in half to expose the inside of a skull and brain called " Hooligan 's Anatomy " after Hirst 's own anatomical works .
Hirst may have set records with his diamond - studded skull and the recent , credit crunch - defying £ 111 m auction of his work , but Merino is not himself averse to money .
In fact , the Hirst money - making magic seems to have rubbed off on him .
His 4 the Love of Go(l ) d has been snapped up by a buyer from Florida , reportedly for $ 41,000 ( £ 28,800 ) .
All his other Hirst spoofs have also been bought at ARCO , going to collectors in Holland and Portugal .
" The art market is bad but actually this year has been spectacular for me , " the 33 - year - old artist said .
" It is ironic .
I 've never sold so much . "

TOKYO ( Reuters ) - Poetry in the loo can cut down on paper use too , says a Japanese group campaigning to save toilet paper as part of the country ’s battle against global warming .
Simply pasting a “ toilet poem ” at the eye level of a person seated in the cubicle can help cut toilet paper use by up to 20 percent , a study by the research center Japan Toilet Labo showed .
“ That paper will meet you only for a moment , ” reads one poem .
“ Fold the paper over and over and over again , ” says another .
Or just : “ Love the toilet . ”
Now the group is looking to have its posters displayed in 1,000 public toilets .
“ We asked ourselves what we could do for the environment in the toilet ? ” said Ryusuke Nagahara of the Japan Toilet Labo .
“ The answer is to save toilet paper and save water . ”
Toilet paper use in Japan has been increasing in recent years , according to an industry body , possibly because of a rise in the number of public toilets , where people tend to use more paper .
“ It ’s because it ’s free , ” said an official at the Kikaisuki Washi Rengokai .
“ At home , people are more inclined to scrimp . ”
• Pledge follows acknowledgment of difficulty of closing facility •
More than 200 detainees remain at Guantánamo Bay
President - elect Barack Obama is to issue an order to close the Guantánamo detention centre in his first week in office , according to his advisers .
Obama , who takes over the presidency next Tuesday , will make closure one of his first decisions , two of his advisers told the AP news agency .
The pledge comes only the day after Obama appeared to row back from campaign promises by saying closure was more complicated than he had realised and it would be a challenge to do so in his first 100 days in office .
Guantánamo has become a touchstone for the new administration .
Democrats and liberal lawyers , as well as European governments , have repeatedly called for its closure , seeing it as an affront to human rights .
Some of the detainees have been tortured .
There were about 700 detainees after a sweep of countries throughout the world as part of George Bush 's " war on terror " .
While most have been released , more than 200 are still held .
There is no consensus yet on what to do with them .
Some will be released , and some could be transferred to other countries , while the remainder could face trial on the US mainland .
Five human rights groups today urged Obama to stop a war crimes trial at Guantanamo of a Canadian , Omar Khadr , now 22 , who is accused of killing a US soldier in Afghanistan when he was 15 .
HOUSTON /ST JOHN’S , Antigua ( Reuters ) - Flamboyant
Texas billionaire Allen Stanford and three of his companies were charged with “ massive ongoing fraud ” Tuesday as federal agents swooped down on his U.S. headquarters .

In a civil complaint filed in federal court in Dallas , the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission accused Stanford , who sponsored international cricket matches , and two other top executives at Stanford Financial Group of fraudulently selling $ 8 billion in high - yield certificates of deposit in a scheme that stretched from Texas to Antigua and around the world .
“ We are alleging a fraud of shocking magnitude that has spread its tentacles throughout the world , ” said Rose Romero , regional director of the SEC ’s office in Fort Worth , Texas .
The SEC complaint names Stanford International Bank , based in Antigua with 30,000 clients in 131 countries and $ 8.5 billion in assets , as well as broker - dealer and investment adviser units based in Houston , with 30 U.S. offices .
In all the company claims to oversee $ 50 billion in assets .
Stanford ’s assets have been frozen and a federal judge has appointed a receiver “ to take possession and control of defendants ’ assets for the protection of defendants ’ victims . ”
On Tuesday morning , about 15 federal agents , some wearing jackets identifying them as U.S. marshals , entered the lobby of Stanford ’s office in the Houston Galleria area , a Reuters eyewitness said .
Stanford Financial remained open for business but was “ under the management of a receiver , ” according to a sign taped to the door of the firm ’s Houston office .
Stanford spokesman Brian Bertsch referred press inquiries to the SEC .
Stanford , a 58 - year - old Texan running the firm that his grandfather founded , has denied any wrongdoing .
His location remained a mystery after the SEC said on Tuesday he had failed to respond to recent subpoenas seeking testimony and did not produce “ a single document .
Stanford ’s real estate holdings and celebrity associations have drawn comparisons with Wall Street investment manager Bernard Madoff , charged in an alleged $ 50 billion fraud .
Stanford has endorsement relationships with golfer Vijay Singh and England soccer star Michael Owen as well as involvement in polo .
Last year Forbes Magazine estimated Stanford ’s personal fortune at $ 2.2 billion .
Stanford ’s website showed no apparent cause for distress on Tuesday , touting a motto of “ hard work , clear vision , value for the client . ”
The website highlighted its sponsorship of the 2009 Sony Ericsson Open in Key Biscayne , Florida in March .
According to the 25 - page SEC complaint , Stanford International Bank ( SIB ) sold $ 8 billion in CDs “ by promising high return rates that exceed those available through true certificates of deposits offered by traditional banks . ”
There were no signs of imminent criminal charges against Stanford , and a Justice Department spokesman would not confirm or deny the existence of a criminal investigation .
But Peter Henning , a professor at Wayne State University Law School in Michigan and a former federal prosecutor , said U.S. prosecutors have likely already filed a sealed criminal indictment against Stanford to be unveiled at a later time .
“ The amount of money involved indicates that there will be criminal interest in this , as well as the number of potential victims involved , ” Henning said .
‘ BETRAYED ’
Investors like Kelly Dehay , a Realtor , showed up at Stanford ’s Houston office on Tuesday to inquire about their funds , only to be turned away at the door .
Dehay said his Stanford broker sold him a CD held by the Antiqua - based SIB and promised returns above 8 percent .
“ I started planning for my retirement a long time ago , ” Dehay said .
“ I feel very betrayed . ”
The developments come as investors , politicians and regulators focus on the returns promised and provided by investment firms , following the alleged Madoff scheme .
Stanford ’s investment companies were exposed to losses from the alleged Madoff scheme but falsely reassured investors otherwise , the SEC charged .
The SEC outlined the Madoff link in its charges against Stanford , and said his firm had sought to remove nearly $ 200 million from its accounts in recent weeks .
The SEC also alleged that Stanford falsely told at least one customer earlier this month that he could not withdraw a multimillion - dollar certificate of deposit because the SEC had frozen the account .
“ Recently , as the market absorbed the news of Bernard Madoff ’s massive Ponzi scheme , SIB has attempted to calm its own investors by claiming the bank has no ‘ direct or indirect ’ exposure to Madoff ’s scheme , ” the SEC said .
“ These assurances are false . ”

SERIES OF ALLEGATIONS
The SEC also alleged that :
-- SIB reported identical returns of 15.71 percent in 1995 and 1996 , which the SEC called “ improbable ” and suspicious .
-- Ninety percent of SIB ’s claimed investment portfolio was in a “ black box ” shielded from any independent oversight , and only Allen Stanford and aide James Davis , also charged , knew details of the bulk of the portfolio .
-- Stanford failed to cooperate with the SEC probe and continued to mislead investors by falsely saying the SEC had frozen accounts or the company had ordered a moratorium on CD redemptions .
-- A major , unidentified clearing firm stopped processing wires to SIB for purchase of SIB - issued CDs after the clearing firm was unable to obtain information about the company ’s financial condition .
-- Stanford used false information to promote a mutual fund program separate from the CDs .
The program grew to more than $ 1.2 billion from less than $ 10 million in 2004 .
James Dunlap , an Atlanta lawyer representing about a dozen investors who bought CDs from Stanford Financial Group , said he planned to sue the financial firm as early as Tuesday and would likely allege the company breached its contract .
Dunlap is representing several investors who tried unsuccessfully to get back their investments with Stanford in recent days .
Several investors have told lawyers they assumed the CDs they bought were safe short - term instruments that were insured , two lawyers said .
But when an investor working with Dunlap tried to get $ 250,000 out of a CD that came due last week , she was told she would have to wait .
ANTIGUA
Stanford came to prominence in the cricket world following his private Twenty20 competition in the Caribbean and , in particular , the $ 20 million game in November between England and his own team , made up of West Indian players .
The England and West Indies cricket boards suspended sponsorship talks with Stanford following the fraud charges .
“ The England and Wales Cricket Board ( ECB ) and the West Indies Cricket Board ( WICB ) have suspended negotiations with Sir Allen Stanford and his financial corporation concerning a new sponsorship deal , ” the ECB said in a statement .
ECB chairman Giles Clarke said his organization may utilize get - out clauses in its deal with Stanford .
“ Clearly , that is a matter we would consider , ” he told reporters before suggesting that the proposed quadrangular Twenty20 series in England in May was now unlikely to happen .

ediff is great .
I had previously used meld but meld is buggy and underpowered .
I use the Python , Haskell , and R integration all the time .
It 's so convenient to have a REPL that works within your editor .
It 's pretty much the reason I switched .
Type some Haskell code , hit C - C C-l , and your cursor is in a buffer with your code loaded .
The buffer management concept makes a lot of sense .
The way you switch between buffers with C-x b matches my workflow well .
magit made my work on improving the git UI effectively obsolete .
( But it 's really slow for some reason ... )
" C-h a " is a useful way to interface with a huge interface surface
The vim scripting language is an abomination and I refused to learn it .
I 've already made a tiny function in emacs lisp for composing entries for my blog software .
I believe the basic editing key bindings are just not the way I operate .
I made a point of not using viper because it produces the uncanny valley effect , where it 's close enough to vi that you get frustrated by esoteric keys not working , and instead forced myself to learn the emacs way before I start changing things .
But now I 'm again considering trying viper .
Undo .
I get how it 's intended to work but it never quite feels right .
Could be learned through more experience , maybe .
I feel like the different programing modes have different keys do needlessly different things .
I understand that a unified UI is contrary to the point of a software system defined by its customizability , but that makes it hard for me to get an intuition for the natural way things ought to work .
For example , why does n't C-h m show me the Haskell - mode specific keybindings while it does in other modes ?
I 've been using vim for a very long time -- over ten years -- but over those years I 've envied more and more the way emacs integrates other software .
So a few months ago I switched .
I do n't see it as the religious issue that many people make it out to be , so the only real hurdle was taking the time to read the manuals .
It turns out switching is surprisingly not that painful ; any competent user of a Unix is already familiar with the basic emacs keybindings because shells use them too .
People have historically complained about emacs being bloated but it was bloated on computers of the 80s ; it 's tiny compared to even simple Java or web - based software today .
I have found my mind has " vi mode " and " other editor " mode , so I keep hitting emacs keybindings in Firefox or Visual Studio .
For comparison ( eclipse / emulator are the Android development tools ) :
What I like : What I do n't like : I get the feeling there are tons of customization tricks that people use that I 'm missing .
So please , tell me your emacs tips !
One of the big things I 've been wanting is making it so when I load up code under the Chromium directory my editor configures itself with the appropriate defaults ( e.g. , .h files are C++ , and M- x compile should run SCons from the proper directory ) .
I saw some project local variables scripts on the emacs wiki but I could n't get them to work right , probably because I 'm missing understanding .
1 Mix the gelatin with the water , then set it aside .
Pour ½ cup ( 120 milliliters ) of cold water into a small bowl .
Stir in 2 envelopes of unflavored gelatin .
Set the bowl aside for 10 minutes so that the gelatin can " bloom . "
During this time , you can prepare the rest of the ingredients .
2 Prepare a 9 by 9 - inch ( 22.86 by 22.86 - centimeter ) square baking pan .
Lightly coat the bottom and sides of a 9 by 9 - inch ( 22.86 by 22.86 - centimeter ) baking pan with cooking oil .
Generously dust it with powdered sugar or cornstarch .
3 Dissolve the granulated sugar with the rest of the water .
Pour the remaining ½ cup ( 120 milliliters ) of water into a saucepan .
Stir in the granulated sugar ( not the powdered sugar ) .
Clip a candy - making thermometer to the saucepan so that it 's ready for the next step .
4 Add the gelatin , then bring the sugar water to 240 °F ( 115 °C ) .
Stir the gelatin water into the sugar water .
Bring the solution to a boil over medium heat .
Let it cook until it reaches 240 °F ( 115 °C ) .
Do not stir during this time .
5 Remove the saucepan from heat and add in the salt and vanilla extract .
Once the sugar water reaches 240 °F ( 115 °C ) , take the saucepan off the stove and set it down onto a heat - safe surface .
Stir in the salt and vanilla extract .
If you do n't like vanilla , you can leave it out or replace it with a different extract .
6 Beat the sugar water in an electric mixer until it doubles in volume .
Pour the sugar water into the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with whisks .
Beat it on a low - speed setting for 2 minutes , then beat it on high for 10 to 15 minutes .
It 's ready when it turns soft and twice its size .
7 Transfer the mixture to the prepared pan .
Use a rubber spatula to help spread the mixture across the bottom of the pan , from corner - to - corner .
If the marshmallow mixture is sticking to the spatula , lightly coat it with cooking oil first .
8 Allow the marshmallow mixture to set for 3 hours .
Leave it uncovered someplace where it wo n't get disturbed .
Once it finishes cooling , dust it with ½ cup ( 65 grams ) of powdered sugar .
9 Cut the marshmallow mixture into 1 - inch ( 2.54 - centimeter ) squares .
Turn the marshmallow slab onto a cutting board .
Use a pizza cutter or a sharp knife to cut it into 1 - inch ( 2.54 - centimeter ) squares .
If the marshmallows are too sticky , coat the blade with some cooking oil .
Clean Energy From Nuclear Fuel Rods and Oil Rigs [ WTF ?!
FTW !]
February 20th , 2009 by Matthew Phelan
Few energy technologies fit CleanTechnica ’s “ Technology Inspired By Nature ” tag - line as thoroughly as the University of Michigan ’s VIVACE Converter — which as we ’ve already mentioned derives many of its innovations from imitating how fish create and exploit turbulent currents .
As adorable and eco-friendly as that sounds , it ’s also reassuring for investors and geeks to know that VIVACE has additional foundation in over a century of really hardcore ( and phenomenally mind - numbing ) mechanical and structural engineering research ( i.e. Fluid Dynamics ) .
VIVACE is basically taking countless studies on suppressing “ vortex - induced vibrations ( VIV ) ” — which can damage everything from the metal cables supporting oil rigs to the nuclear fuel rods placed in a coolant flow — and instead uses them to encourage vibrations and generate energy .
I took a very long look at the research over at SolveClimate.com and interviewed VIVACE inventor Dr. Michael Bernitsas , who conceived of the idea while working with oil companies to suppress VIV on offshore oil rigs and submerged pipelines .
The data comparing VIVACE to conventional power sources has to be seen to be believed .

U.S. Ready to Respond to N.Korea Missile Admiral Keating says the U.S. is prepared to shoot down a North Korean missile .
Feb. 26 , 2009  --
In an exclusive interview with ABC News ' Martha Raddatz , Adm. Timothy Keating , head of the U.S. Pacific Commands , said that the military is prepared to shoot down any North Korean ballistic missile -- if President Obama should give the order .
" If a missile leaves the launch pad we 'll be prepared to respond upon direction of the president , " Keating told ABC News .
" I 'm not a betting man but I 'd go like 60 / 40 , 70/30 that it will , they will attempt to launch a satellite .
There 's equipment moving up there that would indicate the preliminary stages of preparation for a launch .
So I 'd say it 's more than less likely . "
" Should it look like it 's not a satellite launch -- that it 's something other than a satellite launch -- we 'll be ready to respond . "
Intelligence reports suggest that North Korea is preparing a long - range missile test .
Earlier this week , North Korea announced its plans to send a satellite into orbit as part of its space program .
However , many in the international community assert that North Korea 's satellite test is simply a means of concealing a long - range missile test -- a move that would flare existing tension in the region .
Keating said that the military is ready to respond with at least five different systems : destroyer , Aegis cruiser , radar , space - based system and ground - based interceptor .
All of these work in conjunction with one another to protect against any missile threat .
Destroyers are fast , multi- purpose warships that can be used in almost any type of naval operation .
They would likely play a defensive role , helping to repel an air attack and offering a platform for gunfire and missiles to hit airborne objects .
The Aegis cruiser is part of the Navy 's computer - based command and control system that integrates radar and missiles to fight against land , air and sea attacks .
For Keating , the Aegis combat system can tracks threats and counter any short - or medium - range missiles .
Radars vary in type and design , but the military would likely employ a range of sea- based and early warning radars to detect the presence of a North Korean missile , track warheads ' movement and more easily home in on the position of a missile to knock it down .
Space - based infrared system is a defense system that provides warning of any missile launches , detecting the threat and employing other tools to obliterate it .
Ground - based interceptor is a weapon that seeks and destroys incoming ballistic missiles outside of the earth 's atmosphere .
Its sensors give the military the ability to locate and obliterate a North Korean missile .
" We will be fully prepared to respond as the president directs , " Keating said .
" Everything that we need to be ready is ready .
So that 's ready twice in one sentence , but we 're not kidding , it does n't take much for us to be fully postured to respond . "
Missile Launch a ' Stern Test ' of Obama
In the U.S. arsenal is a " very sophisticated and complex , but effective ballistic missile - defense system , " Keating says , which would provide a line of attack against any kind of ballistic missile or warhead that springs from a North Korean launch pad .
Ground - based interceptors , he says , will be able to take down an object other than a satellite .
And while they have not moved ships into place yet , Keating says he is prepared to do so at a moment 's notice .
Experts say that North Korea 's announcement of its satellite launch is an attempt to put Pyongyang on President Obama 's radar .
" It 's a fairly stern test early of President Obama and his administration , " Keating said .
Members of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of [ North ] Korea , a state body , chastised critics Thursday , saying it would retaliate against those who attempt to disrupt its satellite plan .
Keating says the U.S. military is keeping a close eye on the launch pad , but does not want to jump the gun .
" We 're intentionally being a little more cautious and a little more reserved as to not stimulate unnecessary activity in North Korea , " he said .
" We want to do no harm , if you will . "
Nevertheless , Keating says that his priority first and foremost is defending the United States .
" If that means we detect a missile that is a threat to U.S. territory , then we are going to defend U.S. territory .
And [ if ] we hit what we 're aiming at that should be a source of great confidence and reassurance to our allies and partners . "
The CPAN has improved Perl in many ways , but it 's exposed other problems .
If you know how to use the CPAN , you can install and upgrade modules and distributions .
This is great for users .
You get new features and new capabilities , and sometimes you can even change how Perl works internally , without having to upgrade Perl itself .
That 's great for the core developers , because people can experiment with new features and ideas and even syntaxes and dialects without changing the core .
Everything is great ... except for the unforeseen repercussions .
Someone discovered a bug in a core library , and wanted to release a new version without forcing people to upgrade all of Perl and all of their libraries at the same time .
In general , that 's a good policy .
Someone decided that a CPAN module was so widely - used that it belonged in the core .
I can see how that argument works .
It 's certainly worked on lots of modules in the past .
Someone said " That 's great that this is in the core , but someone 's paying me to use it with an older version of Perl , so I refuse to tie its syntax or feature set or capabilities to only those which the current development version of Perl provides . "
I can understand that desire .
None of these are bad ideas in and of themselves , but the consequences are poisonous together .
The chosen solution to one problem was to maintain a core module somewhere outside of the core , where the Perl 5 porters were n't the people responsible for day - to - day maintenance , and to release new versions to the CPAN as they were ready , and to juggle the release schedule with the release schedule for new versions of the Perl core , which should always contain the newest versions of core modules available , even if those modules live elsewhere and have already had releases elsewhere .
Imagine trying to coordinate the release of the core language and half a dozen dual - lived modules .
Now imagine trying to coordinate the release of the core language and several dozen dual - lived modules .
Now there 's a big snarled shoelaces problem and we do n't know anybody named Alexander .
Did I mention that some of these modules have to run on various versions of Perl , unmodified ?
( I spent a summer and fall writing tests for some of these modules , hearing from some maintainers that I could n't use core modules in those tests because those core modules had n't been in core long enough that they were available on older versions of Perl long enough for people to have them installed , nevermind that if they were capable of installing newer versions of these modules , they were fully capable of installing dependencies , and suddenly I wonder if I 've had a persistent pounding in the back of my skull since about June of 2001 , because sometimes it sure feels that way . )
Several modules are in this situation , and we do n't have good answers to several questions :
Who maintains this code ?
Which version of this code is authoritative ?
Which release of this code should supersede other releases ?
When will the next release take place ?
What are the dependencies of this code ?
What is the support and deprecation policy for this code ?
What are the requirements for dependencies in language or supporting libraries for this code ?
Good software developers and project managers ask and answer these questions regularly .
Your answers are critical to the long - term success and maintainability of your project .
I 'll talk about p5 p 's answers in my next entry .
( If you hate the pun in the title , trust me : all of the other candidates were worse . )
ADVERTISEMENT RNC chair denies fraud charges : ' It 's all false ' John Byrne and David Edwards
Published : Sunday February 8 , 2009
Print This Email This UPDATE WITH VIDEO BELOW : Steele denies charges A U.S. Attorney 's office " erroneously " sent a confidential court document to The Washington Post after the Post requested a different file , exposing that the newly - elected chairman of the Republican National Committee had his 2006 Senate campaign pay his sister 's defunct company for services that were potentially never performed -- including $ 37,000 for " catering / web services " paid to her company 11 months after she filed to have it dissolved .
Federal agents have contacted Steele 's sister , the chairman 's spokesman told the paper .
Former Steele campaign finance director Alan Fabian offered the information to the US Attorney 's office as part of attempt to seek leniency for himself in another case .
" It is unclear how extensively his claims have been pursued .
Prosecutors gave him no credit for cooperation when he was sentenced in October , " the Post said .
Steele 's spokesman , Curt Anderson , dismissed the charges .
' " It 's from , what , a convicted felon ?
And it has no substantiation in fact , " he said .
But Fabian 's claims surfaced just as Steele begins his new role at the RNC , where he 's responsible for stewarding hundreds of millions of party dollars .
And they were apparently at least in part substantiated by documents Fabian produced to investigators .
The Post also corroborated some of the claims .
In one allegation , Fabian says Steele 's Senate campaign paid more than $ 37,000 to Brown Sugar Unlimited , a company run by Steele 's sister , Monica Turner .
Records show the expense being for " catering / web services , " but Turner filed to dissolve her company 11 months before the payment was received .
The former Maryland lieutenant governor mounted an unsuccessful bid for Senate in 2006 .
He was the first African American elected to statewide office in Maryland .
" The recent allegations outlined four specific transactions , " Cauvin wrote .
" In addition to the payment to Steele 's sister , Fabian said that the candidate used money from his state campaign improperly ; that Steele paid $ 75,000 from the state campaign to a law firm for work that was never performed ; and that he or an aide transferred more than $ 500,000 in campaign cash from one bank to another without authorization . "
" The bank transfer was made against the explicit wishes of other Maryland Republicans , who had hoped to use it to support the campaigns of state legislators , " he added , according to Steele aides and aides to former Maryland governor Robert Ehrlich Jr .
More on the story is available here .
UPDATE : Appearing on ABC's This Week Sunday , Feb. 8 , Steele denied the charges .
" It 's all false , " he argued .
" This is not the way I intend to run the RNC with this over my head , " he said .

Man Wakes Wife From Coma By Biting Her Toes
A Chinese man has successfully broken the 10 - year comatose state of his wife by biting her toes .
She had suffered a head injury from an industrial accident and had not shown any signs of movement until one day she suddenly squeezed his wrist .
Zhang Kui , of Shenyang , China , claimed that he had tried everything he could think of to wake his wife and nothing seemed to work .
â€ œI played the radio , sang and talked to her and even tickled her , but nothing worked .
I then recalled someone saying that the feet are the home for many nerves .
I wondered if I could wake her up by biting her feet , â€  he told the press .
Zhang would not give up and he bit her toes gently and faithfully every day for 10 years until one day , well , one day , it worked !
His wife of 27 years , Lv Fengshuang , is still unable to speak , but she can move her arms and smile .
â€ œI got goose bumps .
It was like a dead person suddenly gripping your hand , â€  Zhang said .
Zhang hopes that some day soon he will once again hear the voice of the woman he has loved so well and so long .

A redditor recently made the following question
how would a socialist society deal with members who do not want to work , yet still claim to be entitled to the fruits of other people ’s labor ?
Also how would under performing or laziness be dealt with ?
I ’ve dealt with the similar concept of stagnation in a previous post but to this question , another redditor gave a very well thought out response that I believe should not be lost in comment history .
UPDATE : I ’ve been informed by a commenter that this was actually lifted from the Anarchist FAQ .
That ’s why you should give attribution people …
Anarchism ( Libertarian Socialism ) is based on voluntary labor .
If people do not desire to work then they cannot ( must not ) be forced to .
The question arises of what to do with those ( a small minority , to be sure ) who refuse to work .
On this question there is some disagreement .
Some anarchists , particularly communist - anarchists , argue that the lazy should not be deprived of the means of life .
Social pressure , they argue , would force those who take , but do not contribute to the community , to listen to their conscience and start producing for the community that supports them .
Other anarchists are less optimistic and agree with Camillo Berneri when he argues that anarchism should be based upon “ no compulsion to work , but no duty towards those who do not want to work . ”
[ “ The Problem of Work ” , in Why Work ? , Vernon Richards ( ed. ) , p. 74 ]
This means that an anarchist society will not continue to feed , clothe , house someone who can produce but refuses to .
Most anarchists have had enough of the wealthy under capitalism consuming but not producing and do not see why they should support a new group of parasites after the revolution .
Obviously , there is a difference between not wanting to work and being unable to work .
The sick , children , the old , pregnant women and so on will be looked after by their friends and family ( or by the commune , as desired by those involved ) .
As child rearing would be considered “ work ” along with other more obviously economic tasks , mothers and fathers will not have to leave their children unattended and work to make ends meet .
Instead , consideration will be given to the needs of both parents and children as well as the creation of community nurseries and child care centers .
We have to stress here that an anarchist society will not deny anyone the means of life .
This would violate the voluntary labor which is at the heart of all schools of anarchism .
Unlike capitalism , the means of life will not be monopolized by any group — including the commune .
This means that someone who does not wish to join a commune or who does not pull their weight within a commune and are expelled will have access to the means of making a living outside the commune .
We stated that we stress this fact as many supporters of capitalism seem to be unable to understand this point ( or prefer to ignore it and so misrepresent the anarchist position ) .
In an anarchist society , no one will be forced to join a commune simply because they do not have access to the means of production and / or land required to work alone .
Unlike capitalism , where access to these essentials of life is dependent on buying access to them from the capitalist class ( and so , effectively , denied to the vast majority ) , an anarchist society will ensure that all have access and have a real choice between living in a commune and working independently .
This access is based on the fundamental difference between possession and property — the commune possesses as much land as it needs , as do non-members .
The resources used by them are subject to the usual possession rationale — they possess it only as long as they use it and cannot bar others using it if they do not ( i.e. , it is not property ) .
Thus an anarchist commune remains a voluntary association and ensures the end of all forms of wage slavery .
The member of the commune has the choice of working as part of a community , giving according to their abilities and taking according to their needs ( or some other means of organizing production and consumption such as equal income or receiving labor notes , and so on ) , or working independently and so free of communal benefits as well as any commitments ( bar those associated with using communal resources such as roads and so on ) .
So , in most , if not all , anarchist communities , individuals have two options , either they can join a commune and work together as equals , or they can work as an individual or independent co-operative and exchange the product of their labor with others .
If an individual joins a commune and does not carry their weight , even after their fellow workers ask them to , then that person will possibly be expelled and given enough land , tools or means of production to work alone .
Of course , if a person is depressed , run down or otherwise finding it hard to join in communal responsibilities then their friends and fellow workers would do everything in their power to help and be flexible in their approach to the problem .
Some anarchist communities may introduce what Lewis Mumford termed “ basic communism . ”
This means that everyone would get a basic amount of “ purchasing power , ” regardless of productive activity .
If some people were happy with this minimum of resources then they need not work .
If they want access to the full benefits of the commune , then they could take part in the communal labour process .
This could be a means of eliminating all forces , even communal ones , which drive a person to work and so ensure that all labor is fully voluntary ( i.e. not even forced by circumstances ) .
What method a community would use would depend on what people in that community thought was best .
It seems likely , however , that in most anarchist communities people will have to work , but how they do so will be voluntary .
If people did not work then some would live off the labor of those who do work and would be a reversion to capitalism .
However , most social anarchists think that the problem of people trying not to work would be a very minor one in an anarchist society .
This is because work is part of human life and an essential way to express oneself .
With work being voluntary and self - managed , it will become like current day hobbies and many people work harder at their hobbies than they do at “ real ” work ( this FAQ can be considered as an example of this ! ) .
It is the nature of employment under capitalism that makes it “ work ” instead of pleasure .
Work need not be a part of the day that we wish would end .
As Kropotkin argued ( and has been subsequently supported by empirical evidence ) , it is not work that people hate .
Rather it is overwork , in unpleasant circumstances and under the control of others that people hate .
Reduce the hours of labor , improve the working conditions and place the work under self - management and work will stop being a hated thing .
In his own words :
“ Repugnant tasks will disappear , because it is evident that these unhealthy conditions are harmful to society as a whole .
Slaves can submit to them , but free men create new conditions , and their work will be pleasant and infinitely more productive .
The exceptions of today will be the rule of tomorrow . ”
[ The Conquest of Bread , p. 123 ]
This , combined with the workday being shortened , will help ensure that only an idiot would desire to work alone .
As Malatesta argued , the “ individual who wished to supply his own material needs by working alone would be the slave of his labors . ”
[ The Anarchist Revolution , p. 15 ]
So , enlightened self - interest would secure the voluntary labor and egalitarian distribution anarchists favor in the vast majority of the population .
The parasitism associated with capitalism would be a thing of the past .
Thus the problem of the “ lazy ” person fails to understand the nature of humanity nor the revolutionizing effects of freedom and a free society on the nature and content of work .

When people think of BDSM , one of the things their minds see is either bondage or spanking , and that is something whether you are into BDSM or vanilla that is enjoyed by many people , the difference is in the severity .
I like to think there are three stages to spankings ,
Stage
One is the use of your hand only ….. this can still sting but it is a milder form and one that both parties can feel if you like so they know the force and sting behind the slaps , it is no less effective but easier to control and as the surface of the hand is relatively large the force is distributed evenly across the butt or tits * depending where you are slapping *
It will still hurt if you want it to and will still make the area being spanked glow red
The next I call Stage Two …… the use of an instrument .
This could be anything , and as the play progresses then so can the tools used .
A paddle or a crop are good ones to start with as well as a fly swat , yes you read that right , they are the perfect shape and deliver a nice sting , a slipper is also good , these are all things found in your house already so the cost * apart from the crop or flogger * should be minimal *
The marks left from these things are more noticeable , the sting more intense and the pleasure received if your sub / slave is into pain is greater
The next is Stage Three ….
This stage is not for those just starting out as it is the most extreme and can and sometimes does cause the most damage if undertaken by a Dom or Master who does not know what He is doing or used on a sub / slave who is new to this type of thing .
The use of a whip , a cane or flogger , the intense whipping of a certain area and the continual beating of the sub / slave will leave welts and possibly break the skin , it will also leave scars if care is not taken
As with all things in BDSM care needs to be taken and an attentive Master or Dom will always know his property to ensure that they are comfortable with what is happening , spanking is fun but only if it is done correctly and with safety in mind at all times , that said , relax and enjoy this great addition to your lifestyle
Many of us have life insurance .
Some of us have it because we have to as we need it for our mortgage and others have it because they want to make sure that their families are looked after financially if they are not able to look after them .
It is worth making sure that your reason for having life insurance is worthwhile to start with .
If you have savings or other money behind you , then there will be no reason to need life insurance as well as that money should be enough .
However , if you have a mortgage then the insurance could be a condition made by the mortgage provider .
Once you have decided that it is necessary for you to have the insurance , then you will need to look at how much you are paying for it .
If you got one with a mortgage then you may have been sold the one that your mortgage provider recommended or if you used a financial advisor , they may have recommended one .
You will not have to stick with these though and so it is worth seeing whether there is a cheaper one .
There are different methods that you can try in order to do this .
Financial advisor
If you used a financial advisor before then you may wish to go back to them to ask them to check whether the policy that you took out is still the cheapest .
Do make sure that your financial advisor is independent first though .
Some are associated with particular financial institutions and therefore can only recommend products that those places provide .
However , there are some that are independent and will look across all products and these will be the ones that are most likely to find you the policy that will be the best value for money .
The only drawback is that they will charge you and that means that you will need to be confident that they will be able to reduce your premium enough to more than cover the cost of you paying them for their services .
Whether this is possible will depend on how long you are paying your life insurance for .
Insurance broker
An insurance broker is a cheaper alternative to using a financial advisor as they do not charge .
They will look across a limited selection of insurers and let you know whether you could switch to a different one and save money .
They will not charge you because they get paid based on commission that they earn on the leads that they provide .
So if they recommend a particular insurer to you , it is likely that the insurer will pay them commission as a result of that .
This means that there is a risk that they will only recommend insurers that pay them high commission .
You may still be able to find one that saves you money through a broker , but there may be better ones that they do not recommend to you .
Comparison website
A comparison website is very similar to a broker except that it is automated .
They are also paid through commission and they will provide you with a list of insurers that you will be able to compare on price and decide which you feel will be the best for you to go with .
As these use an automated system , you will not need to speak to anyone and this could be preferable for some people , but others may prefer to use a broker as they will be able to explain their situation to them and may even be able to deal with them face to face if they have a local branch .
Own research
The cheapest way to check all insurers and compare them is to do the research yourself .
Some insurers also do not appear on comparison websites so you will be sure to include those as well using this method .
However , it is very time consuming as you will need to put your details in to every insurer to get a quote so that you can see how their price compares to others .
It might be quicker if you use comparison websites as well , as this will allow you to find prices for a selection of insurers and you will not need to visit them singly as well .
It can be good to ask people that you know as well as they may be able to make a recommendation as well .
If they have found a particular insurer to be really cheap then it could be worth you getting a quote from them .
It can be quite time consuming to do all of this research but it will be especially worthwhile if you have an insurance policy that will last a long time so you will be paying a lot into it .
You want to make sure that you are getting a good deal and that you are not paying more than necessary for the insurance cover that you want .
You do need to be careful though , that any cheaper ones will still give you the service that you need .

The disclosure forms for prescription drugs are typically printed using eye - aching 6 - point Helvetica Light Condensed .
It would doubtless be smaller if this minimum were n’t mandated by law .
As a designer or typesetter , your job is to make sure the type you create is n’t just legible , but readable , and usually there ’s no FDA around to make sure you do the right thing .
If you do n’t want your small type to look like it ’s hiding something , if you really want it to be read , it takes some extra effort , because all type programs default to settings for creating full - sized text .
When you start setting smaller type than this , whether it ’s for footnotes , contracts , legal notices , or the front and back matter of books , you have to make adjustments .
Typeface choice
If you ’ve struggled to read a drug disclosure , you know that a light , condensed face for small type is bad news .
What you really want is a face with a wide set width , that is , one whose characters are relatively wide .
In addition , you ’ll want a face with a generous x-height : one whose lowercase letters are rather tall .
Below is a selection of faces illustrating this .
All of these footnotes are set in 7 - point with 9 points of leading .
The apparent size of the various faces varies widely , as does their relative readability .
The faces , from top to bottom , are Adobe Garamond , Bookman , Baskerville , Helvetica , ITC Avant Garde Book , and Antique Olive .
Likewise , faces with a heavier stroke weight and less contrast between the thick and thin parts of their characters are more legible in small sizes .
Palatino , for example , holds up better in petite formats than Garamond , and both fare better than Bodoni .
Although Helvetica Light Condensed may be a poor choice for setting small type , Helvetica itself is not , because it scores high on all the previous criteria : big x-height , good color , and a wide stance .
In fact , many sans serifs fare well in small sizes for the same reasons .
In general , humanist sans serifs such as Gill Sans work better than a geometric sans , such as Futura or Avant Garde , because the shapes and proportions of their letters share more of a seriffed face ’s visual cues to easy character recognition .
Antique Olive is a face that was specifically designed for legibility ( by Roger Excoffon , in the 1960s ) , but it ’s sadly neglected today .
With its lowercase letters that are almost as big as its caps , it stands up very well in small sizes .
Italics suffer particularly badly when set small .
Ironically , they were first developed 500 years ago by Aldus Manutius as a way to cram more type onto a page , because their narrower characters saved space and paper for his popular cheapo editions .
They looked crowded then too , and when you reduce the size of italic type , it can quickly start to look like alphabet soup .
Word and letter spacing
No matter which face you use , when setting small type you should loosen the tracking .
Spaces between characters always appear to change size faster than the type they ’re with : Just as type appears too loosely spaced when its size grows , it appears pinched as its size is reduced .
Depending on the setting , you may have to alter your type ’s hyphenation and justification ( h&j ) settings as well .
Often , loosening tracking to open word spaces enough will cause overall slack character spacing .
In such cases , consider making the h&j Optimal value for word spaces more than 100 % of normal .
( “ Normal ” being the value established in the font itself . )
Leading and line length
You ca n’t reduce point size much without also narrowing its measure ( that is , shortening its line length ) .
For two or three lines , you can suffer a reader to endure small type over a long measure , but in longer paragraphs , it becomes too easy to lose track of the correct baseline as the eye moves from right margin to left .
Generous leading helps .
In magazines with image captions set at reduced point sizes , designers often leave the leading the same as the surrounding text type .
This not only makes for easier reading , but it also makes it easier to align the captions to the page ’s baseline grid .
Footnotes — especially lengthy academic ones — present a particular challenge because they ’re normally set to the full width of the page , matching the measure of the text type .
In these cases , generous leading is a must .
Often , using italics for footnotes will allow for an effective contrast with the text type while allowing you to use a slightly larger point size than you ’d be obliged to use for footnotes set in a roman type .
Background checks
The visual fragility of small type makes it extra vulnerable to other forms of graphic static , such as high color contrast .
In addition , when small type is printed in a blended color ( that is , not pure cyan , magenta , or yellow ) , the screening used to create that blend is going to cause a loss of sharpness more exaggerated than that seen in larger type .
Any slight misregistration multiplies the problem .
The result is fuzzy text that ’s hard to decipher .
Avoid reverses — white type on black — when using small type , especially small italic type or typefaces with high contrast , such as Bodoni .
Inevitably , the ink that forms the black background will spread slightly into the white type areas , thinning them and possibly breaking up thin strokes and hairlines .
Proofing on a desktop printer may not reveal these problems , as these printers are less prone to ink spread than a printing press , especially on absorbent , uncoated paper .
Small can be beautiful
All type is meant to be read , even the fine print — although you have to wonder if the people who write the text necessarily agree .
As always in typography , it ’s the little things that count , and this is nowhere more true than in little type .
OpenType Pro fonts to the rescue ( again )
For the 500 years that commercial type was set using hot or cold metal , it was normal for different sizes of a typeface to have different designs .
Small types were wider , slightly bolder , with taller lowercase characters .
In the 1960s , phototype introduced the possibility of using a single master character design to generate type in a range of sizes .
Fonts with different master sizes ( 8 - point for classified ads , 12 - point for text , 18 - point and up for display ) were still made , but not universally used .
Desktop digital type made the problem worse , forcing everyone to use a single - size type master — usually 12 - point — for type of all sizes .
The OpenType format has broken this limitation by allowing several fonts representing the same typeface to be bundled together transparently in the same package .
Adobe calls these size - specific variants “ opticals . ”
They ’re found in a handful of Adobe ’s OpenType pro fonts .
A good example is Adobe ’s Arno Pro ( shown here ) , which offers five size - dependent variants : caption ( 6 –8.4 point ) , small text ( 8.5 –10.9 point ) , regular ( 11 – 13.9 point ) , subhead ( 14–21.4 point ) , and display ( 21.5 + point ) .
The design of each is matched to the demands of readability in various size ranges .
Designs for smaller sizes feature wider , taller , bolder characters , features that become less so as point size increases .
The only one of Adobe ’s recommended optical ranges that Arno lacks is poster , which would normally kick in above 72 - point .
These point - size ranges are n’t normative , though , and font developers are free to use whatever ranges they choose .
A font could just as easily have three ranges , for example , covering small , medium , and large sizes , applied to point - size ranges of the maker ’s choosing .
As of today , the complete list of Adobe Pro fonts including opticals is Arno , Brioso , Cronos , Chaparral , Garamond Premier , Jenson , Kepler , Minion , Sanvito , Utopia , and Warnock .

UK government 's former chief scientific adviser says Iraq war was about oil , not weapons of mass destruction – and warns there will be more ' resource wars ' to come
The Iraq war was just the first of this century 's " resource wars " , in which powerful countries use force to secure valuable commodities for themselves , according to the UK government 's former chief scientific adviser .
Sir David King predicted that with human population growing , natural resources dwindling and seas rising because of climate change , the squeeze on the planet would lead to more conflict .
" I 'm going to suggest that future historians might look back on our particular recent past and see the Iraq war as the first of the conflicts of this kind – the first of the resource wars , " he told an audience of 400 in London as he delivered the British Humanist Association 's Darwin Day lecture .
Implicitly rejecting the American and British governments ' argument that they went to war to remove Saddam Hussein and search for weapons of mass destruction , he said that the US was very concerned about energy security and supply because of its reliance on foreign oil from unstable states .
" Casting its eye around the world – there was Iraq , " he said .
This strategy could also be used to maintain supplies of other essentials such as minerals , water and fertile land , he added .
" Unless we get to grips with this problem globally , we potentially are going to lead ourselves into a situation where large , powerful nations will secure the resources for their own people at the expense of others . "
King was the UK government 's chief scientific adviser in the run-up to the Iraq war , which began in March 2003 , but he said he did not express his views on the true motivation for the conflict to Tony Blair .
" It was certainly the view that I held at the time , and I think it is fair to say a view that quite a few people in government held at the time , " he said , " but … the chief scientific adviser 's view on that matter was not sought . "
King , who is now director of the Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment at the University of Oxford , said he had previously tried to persuade the Bush administration to adopt more climate - friendly policies .
" I went into the White House in 2001 to persuade them that decarbonising their economy was the way forward – I did n't get much shrift at that time , " he said ruefully .
" What I can tell you is that if I had managed to persuade the government of America that investing – instead of going into Iraq – in decarbonising their economy with roughly a tenth of [ the estimated $ 3 trillion the US spent on the war ] , they would have managed it . "
King 's lecture , entitled Can British science rise to the challenges of the 21st century ?
was part of the celebrations of Charles Darwin 's 200th birthday and the 150th anniversary of the publication of On the Origin of Species .
He said that politicians should not allow the financial crisis to distract them from the imperative to tackle climate change .
" I would like to see [ in ] every speech that Gordon Brown makes on the current fiscal crisis , that he also includes the current global warming crisis , " he said .
" It 's fine for the prime minister to make a very good speech on climate change , but then you need all members of the cabinet , because reducing carbon by 80 % by 2050 will require every part of government to respond . "
He added that in a world of growing population and dwindling resources , fundamental changes to the global economy and society were necessary .
" Consumerism has been a wonderful model , I would suggest , for growing up economies in the 20th century .
Is that model still fit for purpose in the 21st century when resource shortage is our biggest challenge ? "

Is the Octuplets ' Mother Crazy , Addicted , or Anti-social ?
Watching Nadya Suleman , the mother of octuplets , calmly explain herself to NBC's Ann Curry , a number of concerns may rush through our heads .
In fact , Suleman reminds me of no one so much as Rod Blagojevich .
Both maintain they are are sane - and moreover right - in the face of nearly universal opprobrium .
Suleman claims that people disapprove of her multi-motherhood because she is n't married .
This is true , of course , because it undermines her ability to support the children , both financially and emotionally .
Indeed , she is also unemployed .
And she has a history of depression .
Taken together , her appearance raises these concerns :
Suleman is crazy .
Suleman 's placid demeanor while telling Curry she plans on supporting her 14 children while devoting all of her love and attention to each and every one of them reveals someone who is not realistic about time management .
Suleman is self - possessed and articulate -- remarkably more so than Blagojevich , the former two - time governor of a large state .
What lies behind that calmness ?
Even more than Blagojevich , she seems incapable of comprehending the most obvious shortcomings of her behavior and life plan .
Anyone who has watched programs about multiple births ( usually thought of as five or more children born at once ) and immense families ( let 's arbitrarily call these ones with a dozen or more kids ) knows that they require military like precision , two capable and energetic parents , and someone earning a salary .
Even then , these families often seem on the verge of chaos and economic ruin .
Suleman contemplates none of this .
Perhaps she is doing some good financial planning around media contracts for her and her children 's story -- even though reports are that manufacturers are refusing to donate diapers and other baby products to the family because she and her story are so bizarre .
If I were Suleman , I would be nervously examining each child -- which she does n't have to bother herself with since they are still hospitalized -- and frantically calculating my finances .
Suleman is addicted .
Suleman 's most notable quote from the interview with Curry was : " All I wanted was children .
I wanted to be a mom .
That 's all I ever wanted in my life . "
This statement reminds us of teen mothers who feel that a child will justify their lives , as well as provide someone to love them .
Suleman seems to have these feelings in spades .
Having children as life justification is not unusual , of course -- even for normal people .
But to go to such outlandish lengths to provide yourself this gratification , at the cost of any other possible life satisfaction and in a way destructive to you and your loved ones ' lives , indicates addiction .
" I want what I need , no matter what the consequences . "
Suleman is antisocial .
When the octuplets ' birth on January 26th at a Kaiser Permanente facility was publicized on every media outlet , revealing the participation of 45 trained medical personnel , my first thought was , " Who is paying for this ? "
No one has yet asked or answered the question .
Candidates include the general public , California taxpayers , Kaiser Permanente members .
Ms. Suleman is not a self - supporting human being , even before her multiple birthing .
Recently disclosed financial documents reveal that she collected more than $ 168,000 in disability payments between 2002 and 2008 for an on - the - job back injury , which she said left her in near - constant pain ( I guess she wo n't be lifting those babies ) .
So paying for her children on her own is the last thing on Suleman 's mind -- and apparently Ann Curry 's and the rest of the media .
Americans are just not good at calculating health care and humanitarian costs .
While states and municipalities are drastically reducing their law enforcement , medical rescue , and health care resources , we still cheer when 20 firefighters and police officers rescue a puppy who falls through the ice .
We spend up to a quarter of our emergency medical care funds on people in the last months of their lives , who rarely are able to appreciate these efforts .
But while doctors , hospital resources , and social services are and will be devoted to the Suleman clan , others will be forced to do without .
This is our modern American reality , just as someone like Suleman is capable of playing on American generosity and bigheartedness .
( also in : Italiano , Deutsch , Português , Русский ) Quick summary : I wrote a compiler that starts with a ladder diagram and generates native PIC16 or AVR code .
Features include : digital inputs and outputs
timers ( TON , TOF , RTO )
counters ( CTU , CTD , `circular counters ' for use like a sequencer )
analog inputs , analog ( PWM ) outputs
integer variables and arithmetic instructions
easy - to - use serial communications , to a PC , LCD , or other device
shift registers , look - up tables
EEPROM variables , whose values are not forgotten when you lose power
simulator , to test your program before you generate PIC / AVR code
This program is free software ; source code and executables are available for download .
Introduction PLCs are often programmed in ladder logic .
This is because PLCs originally replaced relay control systems , and forty years later , we still have n't quite let go .
A PLC , like any microprocessor , executes a list of instructions in sequence .
Ladder logic tools abstract this ; you can program the PLC by wiring up relay contacts and coils on - screen , and the PLC runtime will simulate the circuit that you 've drawn .
Some of the relay contacts can be tied to input signals from the real world ; some of the coils can be tied to outputs .
That way you can make your simulated circuit interact with other devices , and actually control things .
That is the point .
Actually it 's more general than that , because you can incorporate timers and counters and arithmetic operations that you could n't ( easily ) perform with just relays .
The circuit concept is still useful though , partly just because it 's intuitive , but also because it abstracts the concurrency issues .
It looks like this : || Xa Xb Yout || 1 | |-------]
[------+-------]
[------+-------(
)-------|| || | | || || | Xc | || || +-------]/[------+ ||
This is a simple piece of combinational logic .
There are three input terms , Xa , Xb , and Xc .
There is one output term , Yout .
The expression is Yout := Xa and ( Xb or ( not Xc ) ) .
This makes sense if you think of Xa and Xb as normally open relay contacts , Xc as normally closed relay contacts , and Yout as a relay coil .
Of course it gets more complicated than that : || || || Asetpoint || 1 ||-------------------------------------{READ ADC}----|| || || || Atemperature || ||-------------------------------------{READ ADC}----|| || || || || || || || || || {SUB min_temp :=} || 2 ||------------------------{
Asetpoint - 20 }--------|| || || || {ADD max_temp :=} || ||------------------------{
Asetpoint + 20 }--------|| || || || || || || || || | | [ Atemperature >]
Yheater || 3 | | [ max_temp ]+------------------------(R)-------|| || | || || Xenable | || ||-------]/[------+ || || || | | [ Atemperature <] Xenable Yheater || || [ min_temp ]--------]
[--------------(S)-------|| || || || || || || || || || {SUB check_temp :=} || 4 ||-----------------------{
Asetpoint - 30 }-------|| || || || || || || || || | |[ Atemperature >] Yis_hot || 5 || [ check_temp
]-------------------------(
)-------|| || || || || || || ||------[END ]----------------------------------------|| || || || ||
This is for a simple thermostat .
There are two analog inputs ; one of them is for the setpoint , so that it might , for example , be connected to a pot that the user turns to select the desired temperature .
The other provides the temperature measurement ; it might be a semiconductor temperature sensor , or a platinum RTD with suitable interfacing circuitry .
There is a digital output , Yheater .
That might control a heating element , through a suitable switch ( a TRIAC , or a relay , or a solid - state relay , or whatever ) .
We close the loop with a simple hysteretic ( bang - bang ) controller .
We have selected plus or minus 20 ADC units of hysteresis .
That means that when the temperature falls below ( setpoint - 20 ) , we turn on the heater , and when it climbs above ( setpoint + 20 ) , we turn the heater off .
I chose to add a few small frills .
First , there is an enable input : the heater is forced off when Xenable is low .
I also added an indicator light , Yis_hot , to indicate that the temperature is within regulation .
This compares against a threshold slightly colder than ( setpoint - 20 ) , so that the light does not flicker with the normal cycling of the thermostat .
This is a trivial example , but it should be clear that the language is quite expressive .
Ladder logic is not a general - purpose programming language , but it is Turing - complete , accepted in industry , and , for a limited class of ( mostly control - oriented ) problems , surprisingly convenient .
A Ladder Logic Compiler for PIC16 and AVR Modern sub -3.00 USD microcontrollers probably have about the computing power of a PLC circa 1975 .
They therefore provide more than enough MIPS to run reasonably complex ladder logic with a cycle time of a few milliseconds .
I think PLCs usually have some sort of runtime that 's kind of like an interpreter or a virtual machine , but if we 're doing simple logic on a processor without much memory then a compiler might be a better idea .
So I wrote a compiler .
You start with an empty rung .
You can add contacts ( inputs ) and coils ( outputs ) and more complicated structures to build up your program .
Timers ( TON , TOF , RTO ) are supported .
The max / min durations depend on the cycle time of the `PLC , ' which is configurable ; timers can count from milliseconds to tens of minutes .
There are counters and arithmetic operations ( plus , minus , times , div ) .
Circuit elements may be added in series or in parallel with existing elements .
An I / O list is built from the ladder logic drawn .
You can have internal relays ( Rfoo ) , for which memory is automatically allocated , or inputs ( Xfoo ) and outputs ( Yfoo ) , to which you must assign a pin on the microcontroller .
The selection of pins available depends on the microcontroller .
I have tried to support the most popular PICs and AVRs ( see below ) .
You can edit the program in graphical form :
Then you can test the program by simulating it in real time .
The program appears on screen with the energized ( true ) branches highlighted , which makes it easy to debug .
The state of all variables is shown at the bottom of the screen in the I/O list .
Once the program works in simulation you can assign pins to the inputs and outputs and generate PIC or AVR code .
The code generator is n't all that difficult .
If you realize that a parallel circuit is an OR and a series circuit is an AND , it 's a second - year CS assignment , and not a very long one .
The editor is actually much more challenging .
It would take some work to make a smart compiler , though .
For the AVR a good register allocator would provide a major speedup .
If you wanted to get very fancy then you could apply standard logic reduction algorithms , and maybe state reduction too .
That would be much more difficult .
The timers screw things up anyways .
Even ignoring all that , my code generator for the AVR is very poor .
The AVR back end still generates PIC code ... for example , it does not really take advantage of the fact that the AVR has more than one register .
Some of the code that it generates is just embarrassingly bad .
The PIC back end is better , but not really great .
None of this matters much until you 're trying to run dozens of rungs of logic with fast cycle times .
I support the A/D converter , PWM unit , and UART on those microcontrollers that provide them .
That means that you can write ladder logic that reads analog inputs , and that sends and receives characters over serial ( for example to a PC , if you add a suitable level - shifter like a MAX232 , or to a character LCD ) .
It is possible to send arbitrary strings over serial , as well as the values of integer variables , as ASCII text .
Finally , I now support `preserved variables ' on devices with EEPROM ; you can indicate that a particular variable should be auto - saved to nonvolatile memory whenever it changes , so that its value is persistent across power - on resets .
Limitations , and Disclaimer
Of course a microcontroller with this software can't do everything that a PLC will .
Most PLC environments offer more features and predefined blocks than my tool does .
The PLC hardware is better too ; usually the inputs and outputs are designed to withstand incredible electrical abuse .
You can get a PIC16F877 on a carrier board for ten or twenty USD , though , and you 'll pay a fair bit more for a PLC with the same capabilities .
So far I have received very few bug reports compared to the number of people with questions or feature requests .
There is still great possibility for defects , especially in the targets for microcontrollers that I do not physically have ( and therefore cannot test ) .
Certainly do not use LDmicro for anything safety - critical , or anything that would break something expensive if it failed .
As noted above , the code that it generates is far from optimal .
Also , not all of the data RAM in PIC16 devices is available to the ladder logic program .
This is because I have not implemented very much support for all the paging nonsense .
I do , however , support the program memory paging , which is necessary to access program memory locations in the PIC16 beyond 2 k .
Download
This software is tested under all versions from Windows 2000 to Windows 10 .
Unconfirmed reports suggest that it works under WINE .
The download is a .exe file ; there are no other files required , so there is no installation program .
Save it somewhere on your computer and just run it , and it will work .
The manual is included in the .exe file , but you can download it separately if you want .
The compiler generates Intel IHEX files .
Most of the programming software that I have seen expects this .
Of course you need some sort of programming gadget to get the hex file into the chip .
For the AVRs , I recommend an AVRISP mkII , which is available from various distributors .
For the PICs , I recommend Microchip 's PICkit 2 or 3 , which is available from their web store .
Both of these are officially supported , connect over USB , and cost less than 40 USD .
It should generally be possible to use code generated by LDmicro with a bootloader .
Most AVR parts have special fuses ( BOOTRST , BOOTSZx ) that will need to be configured for whatever bootloader you are using .
The PIC16 parts do n't have any specific hardware support for a bootloader , but LDmicro generates code with the correct format to allow the bootloader to rewrite the reset vector .
I would appreciate any bug reports .
The following chips are supported : PIC16F628(A )
PIC16F88
PIC16F819
PIC16F877(A )
PIC16F876(A )
PIC16F887
PIC16F886
ATmega128
ATmega64
ATmega162
ATmega32
ATmega16
ATmega8
It is also possible to generate C code from the ladder program .
That is less convenient , but you could use it on any processor for which you have a C compiler .
LDmicro can generate interpretable byte code .
If you are willing to write an interpreter then you can use this to run your ladder code on any kind of target .
There is not very much documentation on this , but I provide a sample interpreter in mostly - portable C .

Please report any defects .
This is free software , with no department in charge of quality control .
I do not even have the hardware to test many of the targets myself .
A bug that is not reported is unlikely to ever be fixed .
I have a tutorial , in which I describe how to enter a simple ladder diagram , simulate it , and then generate an IHEX file and program it into a PIC .
That is probably the easiest way to get started with this software .
If you have questions about LDmicro , then ask them on the forum .

Macworld Expo Microsoft wants you to know that it's not just the Mac that 's holding a 25th birthday party : 2009 marks the 25th year that Redmond has developed software for Apple 's quarter - centarian computer .
The Apple / Microsoft relationship has had its rocky moments , to say the least .
But the fact remains that Microsoft has consistently been at the top of the heap among Mac- productivity software publishers since the company released Word 1.0 for Mac in 1984 .
In the Beginning , There Was Word
Although it was Microsoft 's first productivity app for the Mac , Word did n't originate at Microsoft .
It 's earliest ancestor was Bravo , arguably the first WYSI ( sorta ) WYG word processor , developed at Xerox PARC in 1974 .
Seven years later , Microsoft hired Charles Simonyi , one of Bravo 's lead developers , to head - up work on Word 's most - direct progenitor , Multi-Tool Word , which was released in the spring of 1983 for Xenix , Microsoft 's sole foray into the world of Unix .
In 1984 , Multi-Tool Word was ported to the Apple 's new Mac , and Microsoft has been publishing productivity software for the Mac ever since .
For its next trick , Microsoft released Excel 1.0 in 1985 .
Then it shipped PowerPoint 1.0 in 1987 , which remained a Mac-only app until 1990 .
Although obviously influenced by previous spreadsheets such as VisiCalc , Lotus 1 - 2 - 3 , and Microsoft 's own MultiPlan , Excel was developed inside Microsoft .
After a brief vaporware scare from Lotus Jazz , Excel settled into its role as the Mac 's go - to spreadsheet .
PowerPoint was developed by Forethought of Sunnyvale , California , just up the road from Apple 's Cupertino home .
Originally called Presenter , that name was changed by Forethought to PowerPoint when trademark problems surfaced .
Forethought and PowerPoint were bought by Microsoft in 1987 , and in 1989 Microsoft bundled its three Mac apps together in the first version of Office for Mac : Word 4.0 , Excel 2.20 , and PowerPoint 2.01 .
Ron Paul :
We killed a million Iraqis and that pleased bin Laden David Edwards and Muriel Kane

The conservatives attending this week 's Conservative Political Action Conference are generally hawkish when it comes to foreign policy , but they applauded Rep. Ron Paul ( R - TX ) on Friday when he told them the US has no choice but to get out of Iraq .
" Part of the reasons why we lost this last election was the foreign policy issue , " Paul insisted .
" Generally speaking , the presidential candidate who argues the case for less war - mongering will win the election . "
Paul noted that George Bush ran in 2000 on a pledge to end Bill Clinton 's nation - building , but then he " joined the idea that the American taxpayers -- you -- have an obligation to take care of everybody and police the world . "
" This is literally what bankrupts the country , " Paul complained .
" It costs us a trillion dollars a year to take care of our foreign policy , and that cannot last . "
" The person most pleased with our foreign policy is Osama bin Laden , " Paul went on .
" He said , ' I 'm going to get you to come over here and we 'll fight you on our sand , and we will do what we did to the Soviets . ' ...
He said he will do the same thing , he will eventually bankrupt this country . "
" So yeah , " Paul acknowledged .
" We want to get rid of a bad guy in Iraq -- we did .
But ... another one million Iraqis got killed .
Believe me , they were n't all terrorists .
...
But nevertheless , it pleased Osama bin Laden . "
Paul concluded by criticizing President Obama for proposing to send another 17,000 troops to Afghanistan .
" Do n't we know anything about history ? " he asked .
" It is bankrupting our country .
It will end ... because we can't afford it .
...
That 's what the financial crisis is telling us .
... and the sooner we realize that the better . "

Luke Palmer and Nick Szabo can shoot me for this if they want , but I think this is warranted , and I want to connect a couple of dots as well .
Luke is one of a number of computer scientists , with Conal Elliott probably being the best known , who have devoted quite a bit of attention to Functional Reactive Programming , or FRP .
FRP has been discussed on LtU off and on over the years , but , unusually for LtU IMHO , does not seem to have gotten the traction that some other similarly abstruse subjects have .
In parallel , LtU has had a couple of interesting threads about Second Life 's economy , smart contracts , usage control , denial of service , technical vs. legal remedies , and the like .
I would particularly like to call attention to this post by Nick Szabo , in which he discusses a contract language that he designed :
Designing the contract language radically changed my idea of what program flow and instruction pointers can be .
Its successor , a general - purpose programming language , may thereby make event - oriented programming and concurrency far easier .
The language is targeted at GUI programming as well as smart contracts , real - time , and workflow programming .
My answer to the problems of concurrency and event handling is to make the ordering of instructions the syntactic and semantic core of the language .
The order of execution and event handlers are the easiest things to express in the language rather than kludged add - ons to a procedural or functional language .
In recent private correspondence , Nick commented that he 'd determined that he was reinventing synchronous programming Ã la Esterel , and mentioned " Reactive " programming .
Ding !
To make a potentially long entry somewhat shorter , Luke is working on a new language , Dana , which appears to have grown out of some frustration with existing FRP systems , including Conal Elliot 's Reactive , currently perhaps the lynchpin of FRP research .
Luke 's motivating kickoff post for the Dana project can be found here , and there are several follow - up posts , including links to experimental source code repositories .
Of particularly motivating interest , IMHO , is this post , where Luke discusses FRP 's interaction with garbage collection succinctly but nevertheless in some depth .
Luke 's most recent post makes the connection from Dana , which Luke has determined needs to have a dependently - typed core , to Illative Combinatory Logic , explicit , and offers a ~ 100 line type checker for the core .
I find this very exciting , as I believe strongly in the project of being able to express computation centered on time , in the sense of Nick 's contract language , in easy and safe ways extremely compelling .
I 've intuited for some time now that FRP represents a real breakthrough in moving us past the Von Neumann runtime paradigm in fundamental ways , and between Conal Elliott 's and Luke 's work ( and no doubt that of others ) , it seems to me that my sense of this may be borne out , with Nick 's contract language , or something like it , as an initial application realm .
So I wanted to call attention to Luke 's work , and by extension recapitulate Conal 's and Nick's , both for the PLT aspects that Luke 's clearly represents , but also as a challenge to the community to assist in the realization of Nick 's design efforts , if at all possible .
“ Purposeful domestic resistance ” would require military to “ rapidly determine the parameters defining the legitimate use of military force inside the United States . ”

Tuesday , Dec 16 , 2008
A recent report produced by the U.S. Army War College ’s Strategic Institute warns that the United States may experience massive civil unrest in the wake of a series of crises which it has termed “ strategic shock . ”
The report , titled Known Unknowns : Unconventional Strategic Shocks in Defense Strategy Development , also suggests that the military may have to be used to quell domestic disorder .
“ Widespread civil violence inside the United States would force the defense establishment to reorient priorities in extremis to defend basic domestic order and human security , ” the report , authored by [ Ret . ]
Lt. Col. Nathan Freir , reads .
“ Deliberate employment of weapons of mass destruction or other catastrophic capabilities , unforeseen economic collapse , loss of functioning political and legal order , purposeful domestic resistance or insurgency , pervasive public health emergencies , and catastrophic natural and human disasters are all paths to disruptive domestic shock . ” it continues .
“ An American government and defense establishment lulled into complacency by a long - secure domestic order would be forced to rapidly divest some or most external security commitments in order to address rapidly expanding human insecurity at home … ”
“ Already predisposed to defer to the primacy of civilian authorities in instances of domestic security and divest all but the most extreme demands in areas like civil support and consequence management , DoD might be forced by circumstances to put its broad resources at the disposal of civil authorities to contain and reverse violent threats to domestic tranquility .
Under the most extreme circumstances , this might include use of military force against hostile groups inside the United States . ”
Lt. Col. Freir concludes .
See Pages 31 - 32 ( PDF ) for quoted sections .
Freir is a Senior Fellow in the International Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies ( CSIS ) .
He joined the think tank in April 2008 after retiring from the U.S. Army after 20 years as a lieutenant colonel .
In his role at CSIS he rubs shoulders with a whole host of globalist luminaries including Zbigniew Brzezinski , Henry Kissinger , Brent Scowcroft and Richard Armitage .
Echoing recent comments made by Pentagon advisors , along with other notable figures such as Colin Powell and Joe Biden , Freir also warns that the incoming Obama administration should prepare for a “ first term crisis ” that could act as a catalyst for such unrest .
“ The current administration confronted a game - changing ‘ strategic shock ’ inside its first eight months in office , ” the report reads .
“ The next administration would be well - advised to expect the same during the course of its first term .
Indeed , the odds are very high against any of the challenges routinely at the top of the traditional defense agenda triggering the next watershed inside DoD [ Department of Defense ] . ”
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
We have recently highlighted plans to station thousands more U.S. troops inside America for purposes of “ domestic security ” from September 2011 , an expansion of Northcom ’s militarization of the country in preparation for potential civil unrest following a total economic collapse or a mass terror attack .
“ The U.S. military expects to have 20,000 uniformed troops inside the United States by 2011 trained to help state and local officials respond to a nuclear terrorist attack or other domestic catastrophe , according to Pentagon officials , ” reported the Washington Post last month .
In a September 8 Army Times article , Northcom announced that the first wave of the troop deployment , which was put in place on October 1st at Fort Stewart and at Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado Springs , would be aimed at tackling “ civil unrest and crowd control ” .
After a controversy arose surrounding the admissions made in the Army Times article , Northcom retracted the claim but conceded that both lethal and non-lethal weaponry traditionally used in crowd control and riot situations would still be used in the field .
The increasing militarization of America is part of a long term agenda to abolish Constitutional rule and establish a “ military form of government , ” following a large scale terror attack or similar disaster , as Tommy Franks , the former commander of the military ’s Central Command , alluded to in a November 2003 Cigar Aficionado piece .
Franks outlined the scenario by which martial law would be put in place , saying , “ It means the potential of a weapon of mass destruction and a terrorist , massive , casualty - producing event somewhere in the Western world – it may be in the United States of America – that causes our population to question our own Constitution and to begin to militarize our country in order to avoid a repeat of another mass , casualty - producing event .
Which in fact , then begins to unravel the fabric of our Constitution .
Two steps , very , very important . ”
In the short term , the domestic deployment of troops is likely aimed at combating likely civil unrest that will ensue after a complete economic collapse followed by a devastating period of hyperinflation .
This warning was again echoed a few days ago in a leaked internal memo from Citibank .
“ The world is not going back to normal after the magnitude of what they have done .
When the dust settles this will either work , and the money they have pushed into the system will feed through into an inflation shock , ” wrote Tom Fitzpatrick , Citibank ’s chief technical strategist .
The memo predicts “ depression , civil disorder and possibly wars ” as a fallout from an economic collapse that many say is on the horizon .
Naturally , the claim that such troop deployments are merely to aid in disaster relief efforts is a thin veil aimed at distracting from the real goal .
Should a real tragedy occur , volunteers and already existing civil aid organizations are fully capable of dealing with such events , as we witnessed on 9/11 .
The military are primarily trained to kill people and break things , and their role during the Hurricane Katrina relief efforts was mainly focused on detaining people in sports stadiums , shooting alleged looters and seizing guns from wealthy home owners in the high and dry areas , while real recovery measures were left to volunteers and local state authorities .
The open admission that U.S. troops will be involved in law enforcement operations as well as potentially using non-lethal weapons against American citizens is a complete violation of the Posse Comitatus Act and the Insurrection Act , which substantially limit the powers of the federal government to use the military for law enforcement unless under precise and extreme circumstances .
Section 1385 of the Posse Comitatus
Act states , “ Whoever , except in cases and under circumstances expressly authorized by the Constitution or Act of Congress , willfully uses any part of the Army or the Air Force as a posse comitatus or otherwise to execute the laws shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than two years , or both . ”
Under the John Warner Defense Authorization Act , signed by President Bush on October 17 , 2006 , the law was changed to state , “ The President may employ the armed forces to restore public order in any State of the United States the President determines hinders the execution of laws or deprives people of a right , privilege , immunity , or protection named in the Constitution and secured by law or opposes or obstructs the execution of the laws of the United States or impedes the course of justice under those laws . ”
However , these changes were repealed in their entirety by HR 4986 : National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 , reverting back to the original state of the Insurrection Act of 1807 .
Despite this repeal , President Bush attached a signing statement saying that he did not feel bound by the repeal .
It remains to be seen whether President elect Obama will reverse Bush ’s signing statement .
The original text of the Insurrection Act severely limits the power of the President to deploy troops within the United States .
For troops to be deployed , a condition has to exist that , “ (1 ) So hinders the execution of the laws of that State , and of the United States within the State , that any part or class of its people is deprived of a right , privilege , immunity , or protection named in the Constitution and secured by law , and the constituted authorities of that State are unable , fail , or refuse to protect that right , privilege , or immunity , or to give that protection ; or ( 2 ) opposes or obstructs the execution of the laws of the United States or impedes the course of justice under those laws .
In any situation covered by clause ( 1 ) , the State shall be considered to have denied the equal protection of the laws secured by the Constitution . ”
Is the incoming Obama administration and Northcom waiting for such a scenario to unfold , an event that completely overwhelms state authorities , before unleashing the might of the U.S. Army against the American people ?
[ Ret. ] Lt. Col. Freir ’s Known Unknowns report addresses this specifically , stating :
“ A whole host of long - standing defense conventions would be severely tested .
Under these conditions and at their most violent extreme , civilian authorities , on advice of the defense establishment , would need to rapidly determine the parameters defining the legitimate use of military force inside the United States .
Further still , the whole concept of conflict termination and / or transition to the primacy of civilian security institutions would be uncharted ground .
DoD is already challenged by stabilization abroad .
Imagine the challenges associated with doing so on a massive scale at home . ”
The deployment of National Guard troops to aid law enforcement or for disaster relief purposes is legal under the authority of the governor of a state , but using active duty U.S. Army in law enforcement operations inside America absent the conditions described in the Insurrection Act is completely illegal .
The political left and right need to join forces and denounce this plan for what it is – another unconstitutional step towards the incremental implementation of martial law and the militarization of America .

Massachusetts Wants Residents to Pay Sales Tax …For Purchases in Tax Free New Hampshire Part 2
The outrage has been growing since word got out that Massachusetts is trying to force a New Hampshire store to implement a 5 % Massachusetts sales tax on Deval Patrick ’s subjects .
And the outrage is n’t limited to Massachusetts residents .
New Hampshire is not too happy about this either .
Manchester Mayor Frank Guinta , who should have run for governor , promised to fight this outrageously unconstitutional idea .
He called this lawsuit harassment .
Meanwhile Nancy C. Kyle , president of the Retail Merchants Association of New Hampshire sums up my feelings on this when she claims that this is just the beginning :
think it ’s horrific , ” she said .
“ I do n’t think it ’s any coincidence that the state of Massachusetts is going after a medium - sized retailer .
They ’re testing the waters to see how it goes and if they win their case , the big - box retailers are next
Exactly , Massachusetts is trying to see how much it can get away with .
If the communist governor of Massachusetts is allowed to get away with this blatant violation of the commerce clause in the constitution than it will just be the beginning .
There will be many stores who are also forced to implement the laws that Massachusetts is incompetent to enforce .
Some New Hampshire officials seem to be taking a wait and see attitude :
The issue is going through the courts of Massachusetts so it would be premature for us to take any position , but we are monitoring it
Governor Lynch may be for the first time taking a position on an issue that I agree with :
Colin Manning , a press secretary for Gov. John Lynch , said yesterday , “ There is no sales tax in New Hampshire and there should be no tax charged to items sold in New Hampshire . ”
And we certainlyshould n’t be bullied into it by a governor who is overstepping his bounds in such a blatantly unconstitutional manner .
Deval Patrick is upset that so much potential revenue is being lost to New Hampshire that he wants to not only put a stop to residents crossing the border to shop , he wants New Hampshire to enforce Massachusetts tax laws .
He wants to dictate where his subjects can shop .
This Union Leader article sums it up well with the following statement :
The State of Massachusetts is trying to turn New Hampshire businesses into tax collection agents for the Massachusetts Department of Revenue .
To this , there is only one appropriate response from the state of New Hampshire .
It is n’t “ no . ”
It ’s “ Hell , no . ”
The Union Leader article goes even further :
If the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court upholds this clearly unconstitutional cross - border tax grab , Gov. Lynch should immediately dispatch the National Guard to all six Town Fair Tire locations in New Hampshire and tell Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick , “ If you want that revenue , come and get it . ”
If you think that that position is extreme , the paper does n’t think so :
We are not joking .
New Hampshire cannot let Massachusetts apply its taxes on our sovereign soil .
It can subjugate its own people all it wants , but it must not be allowed to turn New Hampshire residents doing business entirely in the state of New Hampshire into subjects of the state of Massachusetts
Just for the record , in my post yesterday about this issue I called the residents of Massachusetts “ subjects ” before the Union Leader article did the same .
But that is neither here nor there , I just wanted to throw that out there .
Governor Lynch needs to step up to the plate on this issue , he needs to actually show that he has a pair and he needs to stick up for the businesses of New Hampshire .
He needs to defend what we like to call the New Hampshire advantage .
Where will this insanity stop ?
What about meals taxes ?
If Massachusetts residents eats in a New Hampshire resident will they have to pay the 8 % New Hampshire meals tax and the 5 % Massachusetts meals tax .
What about taxes on hotels and lodges ?
What if New Hampshire decides to follow suit on such things as taxes on meals and hotels enjoyed in Massachusetts ?
Where does it end ?
We know that eventually this will spread to other states looking to make a few extra dollars instead of cutting wasteful spending .
This is just the beginning .
This rather puts Burnout Paradise ’s sprawling cityscape into perspective .
FUEL , Codemasters ’ new open world racing game , features 5000 km of open terrain .
This new chunk of footage illustrates that to startling effect .
We were already intrigued the massive space Codies were talking about , but this brings it home .
Suddenly the idea that it really does have that much space in it seems real .
Not only that , but it ’s out in May .
Oh my .
We ’ll have an interview with the developers , Asobo Studio , very soon .
Adopting an animal is an exciting time for a household .
There are many different places that animals can be found , but the absolute best choice would be an animal shelter or breed rescue group .
Every year over 4 million dogs and cats are euthanized for no other reason that the fact that there are not enough homes available for all of them .
This problem hasbecome biggerin large part because of three mainreasons :
First , puppy mills which breed animals only for the money theycan make without any regard for the health and well being of the animals ; second , individuals whodecide to breed their own animals to make money and ; third , individuals whodo not spayor neuter their animals , and carelessly let their animals breed and produce litters .
Animal shelters are often filled to capacity for these reasons .
By adopting an animal from a shelter or rescue group , you are helping to solve the pet overpopulation problem .
Some people believe that an animal shelter will not have aparticular breed type , but sheltersoften havepurebred animals if that is what you are looking for .
The process may take longer if you are looking for apurebred animal , but often the breed you are looking for willbeturned over toa shelter at some point if you are patient .
There are also breed rescue groups for almost every breed of animal .
A list of these groups can be found through your local animal shelter , or you can find them online by searching for whatever breed you are interested in .
Be sure to include the words " rescue group " in your search criteria .
Alsoremember thatmixed breed animals make wonderful pets , so do not rule out adopting a mixed breed even if you are set on adopting a purebred animal .
You have finally found the perfect pet from a shelter or rescue groupand you are still wondering what you can do to help put an end to the petoverpopulation problem .
Here are some things you can do to continue to help .
Please have your pet spayed or neutered .
Most shelters will do this as part of your adoption fee , but if for some reason the animal you gethas not been fixed , please havethis done .
There are often lower cost spay / neuter clinics provided to the public several times a year , so there is no excuse not to spay or neuter your animal .
Another thing you can do is shop your conscience by only shopping at pet supply stores that do not sell live animals .
If your local pet shop does sell live animals , let them know how you feel about this problem .
If puppy mill breeders have trouble selling their animals to pet shopsthey will no longer want to be in this business .
Also , please consider you newly adopted pet as a member of your family .
Too many people decide to get an animal and then find out the situation does not work for them .
Please do your homework before you make this decision so you are not in the position of having to turn your animal over to a shelter because you did not thoroughly understand the commitment .
By adopting your animal from a shelter or breed rescue group you can feel good about helping solve an enormous problem and know that you are part of the solution .

NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) --
Gold futures fell Thursday as investors digested fresh developments in Washington surrounding the government 's proposed plan to help resuscitate the U.S. financial sector .
Key leaders of the House and Senate committees that oversee Wall Street announced Thursday that a " fundamental " bipartisan agreement has been reached on principles for a $ 700 billion rescue plan to patch the shattered financial sector .
" Until the bailout proposal becomes law , investors will remain reluctant to take big positions in a number of commodity complexes , " said Edward Meir , a commodities analyst at futures brokerage MF Global .
Gold for December delivery fell $ 13 , or 1.5 % , to end at $ 882 an ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange .
Several lawmakers
Thursday openly predicted that the unprecedented plan would be approved by Congress , but they remained mum on specifics of the plan , which has to go back to their leadership and the White House for ultimate approval .
See full story .
In a sobering speech to the nation late Wednesday , Bush said major sectors of the U.S. financial system are at serious risk of disruption .
If the plan is enacted , gold prices could rebound , analysts said .
The plan " will continue to undermine the value of the U.S. dollar and further support a flow of capital out of paper into hard assets , into gold and silver , " said Peter Spina , president , Gold Seek LLC .
The dollar turned lower Thursday , limiting commodities ' losses .
A weaker greenback tends to push up dollar - denominated commodities prices .
See Currencies .
" Given the weaker U.S. economic and dollar outlook , increased safe - haven demand and improved technical picture , gold is in a strong position to push higher , " said James Moore , an analyst at TheBullionDesk.com
Also in metals , platinum for October delivery lost 2.8 % to $ 1,184.20 an ounce , while December palladium dropped 4.1 % to $ 242.45 an ounce .
December silver fell 1.2 % to $ 13.28 an ounce , with December copper rose slightly to $ 3.13 a pound .
In spot trading , the London gold - fixing price 38099902 , used as a benchmark for gold for immediate delivery , stood at $ 888.50 an ounce Thursday afternoon , down $ 7.50 from Wednesday afternoon .
On the equities side , the Amex Gold Bugs Index HUI , lost 2.9 % to close at 336.11 points .
Breaking : Somali pirates acquire Citigroup ?
Amid a slew of piracy stories from Somalia , a fake Bloomberg piece is circulating the ‘ net today with a report that Wall Street bankers might cringe upon reading :
Somali Pirates in Discussions to Acquire Citigroup
By Andreas Hippin
November 20 ( Bloomberg ) —
The Somali pirates , renegade Somalis known for hijacking ships for ransom in the Gulf of Aden , are negotiating a purchase of Citigroup .
The pirates would buy Citigroup with new debt and their existing cash stockpiles , earned most recently from hijacking numerous ships , including most recently a $ 200 million Saudi Arabian oil tanker .
The Somali pirates are offering up to $ 0.10 per share for Citigroup , pirate spokesman Sugule Ali said earlier today .
The negotiations have entered the final stage , Ali said .
“ You may not like our price , but we are not in the business of paying for things .
Be happy we are in the mood to
offer the shareholders anything , ” said Ali .
The pirates will finance part of the purchase by selling new Pirate Ransom Backed Securities .
The PRBS ’s are backed by the cash flows from future ransom payments from hijackings in the Gulf of Aden .
Moody ’s and S&P have already issued their top investment grade ratings for the PRBS’s .
Head pirate , Ubu Kalid Shandu , said : “ We need a bank so that we have a place to keep all of our ransom money .
Thankfully , the dislocations in the capital markets has allowed us to purchase Citigroup
at an attractive valuation and to take advantage of TARP capital to grow the business even faster . ”
Shandu added , “ We do n’t call ourselves pirates .
We are coastguards and this will just allow us to guard our coasts better . ”
In real pirate news , the Weekly Piracy Report counted 11 incidents last week .
And James Carrol debunks the lessons of piracy in the International Herald Tribune .

Hi Blog .
The new policing system for NJ is slowly materializing .
In what looks to be a privy leak to the Yomiuri ( scooping almost all the other newspapers according to a Google News search ; distracted by a drunk Nakagawa and Hillary ’s visit ? ) , yesterday ’s news had the GOJ proposal for new improved “ Gaijin Cards ” .
Yomiuri says it ’s to “ sniff out illegals ” and to somehow increase the “ convenience ” for foreigners ( according to the Yomiuri podcast the same day ) .
It ’s still to centralize all registration and policing powers within the Justice Ministry , and anyone not a Special Permanent Resident ( the Zainichis , which is fine , but Regular Permanent Residents who have no visa issues with workplace etc. ) must report minute updates whenever there ’s a lifestyle change , on pain of criminal prosecution .
Does n’t sound all that “ convenient ” to me .
I ’m also not sure how this will be more effective than the present system in “ sniffing out illegals ” unless it ’s an IC Card able to track people remotely .
But that ’s not discussed in the article .
I last reported on this on Debito.org nearly a year ago , where I noted among other things that the very rhetoric of the card is “ stay ” ( zairyuu ) , rather than “ residency ” ( zaijuu ) .
For all the alleged improvements , the gaijin are still only temporary .
One bit of good news included as a bonus in the article is that NJ Trainees are going to be included for protection in the Labor Laws .
Good .
Finally .
Read on .
Arudou Debito in Sapporo
=========================
Govt to issue new ID cards to sniff out illegals
The government intends to strengthen its efforts to prevent foreigners from staying here illegally by unifying administrative systems for foreign residents in the nation , according to a draft bill to revise the immigration law obtained by The Yomiuri Shimbun on Monday .
The draft legislation to revise the Immigration Control and Refugee Recognition Law states that the justice minister will issue new residence cards to aliens staying in Japan for mid- to long - term periods of time .
The current alien registration certificates issued by municipal governments will be abolished , and foreigners will instead use the new cards as identification .
The draft bill also includes provisions to imprison or deport people who forge the envisaged cards .
The government plans to submit the bill during the current Diet session , according to sources .
The new residence cards will carry the foreigner ’s name , date of birth , gender , nationality , address , status of residence and period of stay .
The cards will be issued to aliens staying in Japan legally .
The cards will enable authorities to detect illegal stayers by checking whether they possess the cards .
The draft bill will require foreign residents to report to the Immigration Bureau any changes such as to their place of employment , school or address .
Under the current law , foreign residents are required to report such changes only to municipal governments .
However , this system has bogged down attempts by the Immigration Bureau to keep a comprehensive track of foreign residents .
The revised law also will allow the bureau to investigate , on a voluntary basis , institutions and other bodies that are responsible for helping foreigners enter the country .
So - called special permanent residents –Koreans living in Japan–will not be required to acquire the envisaged residence cards .
Instead , new identification certificates will be issued to them .
To reduce the time and paperwork involved in renewal procedures , the draft bill calls for extending the period of stay to five years for aliens who are currently allowed to stay in Japan for up to three years .
The draft legislation also includes a provision to create a new status of residence for aliens coming to Japan on the government ’s foreign trainee system .
It stipulates that the Minimum Wages Law and other labor - related laws will be applied to such foreign trainees .
The foreign trainee system is aimed at transferring Japan ’s technical expertise to other countries .
Under the system , foreign trainees participate in workshops and training programs at companies for up to three years .
However , the system has been criticized because some companies take advantage of these trainees by making them work excessively long hours for low pay .
For the first year of their stay , the foreign trainees are not officially recognized as laborers , and therefore they fall outside the reach of labor - related laws .
Meanwhile , the status of residence for international students will no longer be divided into “ college students , ” who attend a college or advanced vocational school , and “ pre-college students , ” who attend a high school or Japanese language school .
Under the envisaged new system , the two categories will be integrated to allow foreign students to skip procedures to change their status of residence when they go on to higher education .
外国人に 「在留カード」…偽造行為に罰則、国が一元管理へ
http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/politics/news/20090216-OYT1T01221.htm
政府が今国会に提出する出入国管理・難民認定法改正案の概要が１６日、明らかになった。
中長期に日本に滞在する外国人に対し、身分証となる「在留カード」を法相が発行し、在留管理を国に一元化する。これに伴い、市区町村が発行している外国人登録証明書は廃止する。カードの偽造行為には懲役刑や強制退去処分の罰則規定を設ける。
カードには氏名や生年月日、性別、国籍、住所、在留資格、在留期間を記載。勤務先や住所などに変更があった場合は、入国管理局に届け出ることを義務づける。
「特別永住者」と呼ばれる在日韓国・朝鮮人は在留カードの対象から外し、新たな身分証明書を発行する。原則３年が上限の外国人の在留期間を５年に延長することも盛り込んだ。

A new strain of malware that can spread rapidly from machine to machine using a variety of infection techniques , including the poisoning of web servers which then go on to contaminate visitors , has reportedly been identified by Security Researchers .
( Source : theregister.co.uk )
The malware , dubbed VIRUX by security researchers at Trend Micro , is spreading around the globe , but seems to be propagating faster in the U.S. than anywhere else .
( Source : trendmicro.com )
VIRUX appears to be more complex than its cousin VIRUT and has the ability to circumvent Microsoft 's Windows Firewall security software .
( Source : eweek.com )
Infector Chooses Multiple Infection Styles
The Malware Infectors Choose Any Of The Following Infection Styles :
Like a tooth cavity , the virus inserts its code into available spaces within the normal file appending
The virus inserts its code after the normal file 's code prepending
The virus inserts its code before the normal file 's code entry - point , a complex infection technique used to evade immediate detection
Stunned by its effectiveness , a TrendLabs researcher recently wrote , " VIRUX hunts down target files and infects them using more than one infection technique and sometimes more than one encryption routine . "
( Source : trendmicro.com )
VIRUX can and will infect both .EXE and .SCR files , turning them into variants of VIRUX themselves .
Once infected , the infected PC connects to IRC ( Internet Relay Chat ) servers where it joins a channel to receive and execute commands on the affected PC .
VIRUX Also Infects Script Files
Apart from the routine mentioned above , what sets VIRUX apart from VIRUT is that it also infects script files .
For .
PHP , .ASP and .HTML files , VIRUX inserts a malicious IFrame code which is automatically loaded when the script files are opened .
If the script files happen to be uploaded to a publicly accessible website , any visitor to the affected sites will be led to the malicious URL embedded in the IFrame code that automatically downloads other malicious files to your PC .
A pretty thorough breakdown of how the virulent virus has changed has been composed by Websense Researcher Nicolas Brulez who concludes :
" Many aspects of the Virut virus have changed , making newer variants much more effective .
The fact that it infects running processes makes it very virulent .
If you move a file that matches the requirements in the infected code onto an infected machine , it is instantly infected .
The virus also uses the SFC ( System File Checker ) functions to make sure Windows wo n't pop up an error message if a Windows file is infected .
The fact that it infects
Web pages makes it even more virulent , as Webmasters could and probably do upload infected HTM / ASP / PHP pages , leading to various exploits that target their visitors . "
( Source : websense.com )
Microsoft researchers say that once your system is infected , it injects its code into various system processes such as explorer.exe and winlogon.exe and hooks low - level Windows APIs ( Application Program Interface ) to ensure that it stays in memory .
Information regarding Win32 / Virut as well as prevention tips are available from Microsoft .

Perhaps the safest advice is also the simplest : avoid those sites you do n't trust 100 % .

Stephen Lawrence was murdered by white youths in 1993 Police forces in England and Wales are still institutionally racist despite attempts to confront the issue , a review claims .
The report criticised failures to recruit and keep black officers and the reliance on stop and search techniques .
The Runnymede Trust also said some forces were " dragging their feet " when it came to reporting racist offences .
The findings come from the Trust 's review , The Stephen Lawrence Inquiry 10 Years On. ' Significant problems '
The review looked at the murder of black teenager Stephen Lawrence , who was killed in an unprovoked racist knife attack by a gang of white youths in April 1993 .
In 1999 , the Macpherson Inquiry severely criticised police for the handling of the subsequent murder investigation .
The Runnymede Trust - a body that specialises in studying equality - singled out the Crown Prosecution Service ( CPS ) for praise for its work on recording and monitoring data related to racist incidents .
However , its review found in the intervening years since the inquiry there were still significant problems .
It said black and minority ethnic officers were more likely to be dismissed than white colleagues .
A disproportionate amount of black and minority ethnic officers left their police careers early , the report also found .
I think it can be said that the police are still institutionally racist
Rob Berkeley , Runnymede Trust director
The report said : " While much is made of the fact that the percentage of officers from these backgrounds has doubled between 1999 and 2008 , in reality this is only from a relatively low starting - point of 2 % to approximately 4 % .
" This is considerably below the national target ( 7 % ) set for the police service overall .
" It is difficult , in light of these continued challenges , to argue that the charge of institutional racism no longer applies , " the report said .
Rob Berkeley , director of the Runnymede Trust said : " I think it can be said that the police are still institutionally racist .
" There 's lots of controversy about the term , but if they were in 1999 they still are in 2009 . "
A Home Office spokeswoman said : " We are determined to work with the police service to offer fair and equal opportunities to all its members , regardless of age , gender , ethnicity or background .
" We have already come a long way : over the last 10 years minority ethnic officer representation in the police service has doubled . "

It 's Monday , which apparently means time for yet another Blu-ray fighting Chinese high definition disc format , this time NVD .
With China Blue HD barely out the door and EVD conspicuous only in its absence , HD NVD players apparently went on sale today in Wuhan , featuring 12 GB of storage on a red laser disc format that -- unlike the Toshiba technology backed CBHD / HD DVD variant -- is not only Made in China , but Created in China , with the hope that owning their own IP can net 4 - 5 times the profit for its manufacturers .
80 % of the world 's DVDs and players are reportedly produced in China , so now production lines can switch to NVD HD cheaply -- stop us if you 've heard this before .
It 's clear that these companies are chafing under the royalties of foreign tech , but until we hear something about content support in any major way , it 's hard to believe this format war is even worth fighting .

Here at TSA we love Burnout , we really do .
However , we ’re always up for some more racing fun .
Enter FUEL .
According to the official site , FUEL ( caps essential ) will be ‘ the world ’s largest ever racing environment , with over 5,000 square miles of spectacular wilderness .
The multi-terrain , multi-vehicle racing , on and off - road , two and four - wheeled vehicles race a massively diverse environment , from scaling the highest snow - capped mountain to racing the deepest arid canyon . ‘
The game is currently expected sometime in 2009 .
– ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW –
Seemingly a mixture between the open - world nature of Burnout and the grungy appearance of Motorstorm , FUEL is definitely something to keep your eyes on .
But why the news story all of a sudden ?
Well , if you had n’t guessed by the title then Codemasters have released the first video of gameplay footage , which must make this post into the hundreds of thousands of words .
Enjoy .
In How Much is a Trillion , we talked about how a trillion of anything could relate to us as individuals .
For those seeking a great job , one paying $ 1 for every second , they were unlikely to even earn a trillion dollars , as it would take more than 31,000 years to do it .
Remember , that ’s $ 1/ second .
And it would take more than 31,000 years to spend / earn a trillion dollars .
Moving on , for sports fans , we compared a trillion dollars to the amount of money it would take to give every major baseball player on the 40 - man roster of every one of the thirty teams , a $ 250 million contract just like A - Rod’s .
And we found that they were short of a trillion dollars , with plenty of room to spare .
So much room , that they could have , effectively given every player a $ 750 million contract , and still not quite reached a trillion , though they would be close .
Then we looked out into the depths of space to find that the furthest things we ’ve seen out there were about 90 trillion miles away , but the light from them would take 15 billion years to reach us , just so we could see what they were up to 15 billion years ago .
Well , here ’s some more perspective .
We found out from our $ 1 / second job that it would take 31,709 years to reach one trillion seconds .
( That ’s 1,000,000,000,000 . )
One trillion seconds ago , humans were just becoming humans .
We used to call them Cro-Magnon , but scientists seem to favor the term “ Early Modern Humans ” ( or EMH ) now .
Not sure why .
Something to do with them not really being all that different from Neanderthals after all .
A trillion seconds ago , the Earth was coming out of its last ice age .
A trillion minutes ago saw the beginnings of any form of “ mankind ” with the emergence of the genus Homo .
There are some who would argue that the downfall of Earth began here .
I ’ll let you folks discuss that one .
A trillion hours ago , we were in the middle of the Cretaceous Period .
Flowering plants were starting to dominate the planet .
Dinosaurs were still around , but they would soon be gone .
A trillion days ago , multi-cell organisms did not yet exist on this planet .
And in the rare places you did find your unicelluar life forms , it was probably because the crust had finished forming in that particular part of the Earth .
I would n’t invest in real estate just yet , as property values are bound to change .
And a trillion weeks ago , the Earth did n’t exist .
Nor did our Solar System , nor the Milky Way galaxy , not any of the other galaxies we ’ve seen with our best telescopes .
The Big Bang had n’t even happened yet .
And that was just a trillion weeks ago .
If time really is money , then money is time .
And at the rate we are spending money on things that are not really helping us at all ( such as the endless war in Iraq , or the financial markets bailouts ) , we will soon be literally spending our way into oblivion .

It ’s a kitchen degreaser .
It ’s a window cleaner .
It kills athlete ’s foot .
Oh , and you can drink it .
Sounds like the old “ Saturday Night Live ” gag for Shimmer , the faux floor polish plugged by Gilda Radner .
But the elixir is real .
It has been approved by U.S. regulators .
And it ’s starting to replace the toxic chemicals Americans use at home and on the job .
The stuff is a simple mixture of table salt and tap water whose ions have been scrambled with an electric current .
Researchers have dubbed it electrolyzed water -- hardly as catchy as Mr. Clean .
But at the Sheraton Delfina in Santa Monica , some hotel workers are calling it el liquido milagroso -- the miracle liquid .
That ’s as good a name as any for a substance that scientists say is powerful enough to kill anthrax spores without harming people or the environment .
Used as a sanitizer for decades in Russia and Japan , it ’s slowly winning acceptance in the United States .
A New York poultry processor uses it to kill salmonella on chicken carcasses .
Minnesota grocery clerks spray sticky conveyors in the checkout lanes .
Michigan jailers mop with electrolyzed water to keep potentially lethal cleaners out of the hands of inmates .
In Santa Monica , the once - skeptical Sheraton housekeeping staff has ditched skin- chapping bleach and pungent ammonia for spray bottles filled with electrolyzed water to clean toilets and sinks .
“ I did n’t believe in it at first because it did n’t have foam or any scent , ” said housekeeper Flor Corona .
“ But I can tell you it works .
My rooms are clean . ”
Management likes it too .
The mixture costs less than a penny a gallon .
It cuts down on employee injuries from chemicals .
It reduces shipping costs and waste because hotel staffers prepare the elixir on site .
And it ’s helping the Sheraton Delfina tout its environmental credentials to guests .
The hotel ’s kitchen staff recently began disinfecting produce with electrolyzed water .
They say the lettuce lasts longer .
They ’re hoping to replace detergent in the dishwasher .
Management figures the payback time for the $ 10,000 electrolysis machine will be less than a year .
“ It ’s green .
It saves money .
And it ’s the right thing to do , ” said Glenn Epstein , executive assistant at the Sheraton Delfina .
“ It ’s almost like fantasy . ”
Actually , it ’s chemistry .
For more than two centuries , scientists have tinkered with electrolysis , the use of an electric current to bring about a chemical reaction ( not the hair - removal technique of the same name that ’s popular in Beverly Hills ) .
That ’s how we got metal electroplating and large - scale production of chlorine , used to bleach and sanitize .
It turns out that zapping salt water with low - voltage electricity creates a couple of powerful yet nontoxic cleaning agents .
Sodium ions are converted into sodium hydroxide , an alkaline liquid that cleans and degreases like detergent , but without the scrubbing bubbles .
Chloride ions become hypochlorous acid , a potent disinfectant known as acid water .
“ It ’s 10 times more effective than bleach in killing bacteria , ” said Yen - Con Hung , a professor of food science at the University of Georgia - Griffin , who has been researching electrolyzed water for more than a decade .
“ And it ’s safe . ”
There are drawbacks .
Electrolyzed water loses its potency fairly quickly , so it ca n’t be stored long .
Machines are pricey and geared mainly for industrial use .
The process also needs to be monitored frequently for the right strength .
Then there ’s the “ magic water ” hype that has accompanied electrolyzed drinking water .
A number of companies sell so - called ionizers for home use that can range from about $ 600 to more than $ 3,000 .
The alkaline water , proponents say , provides health benefits .
But Richard Wullaert , a Santa Barbara consultant , said consumers should be careful .
“ Some of these people are making claims that will get everybody in trouble , ” said Wullaert , whose nonprofit Functional Water Society is spreading the word about electrolyzed water .
“ It ’s time for some serious conferences with serious scientists to give this credibility . ”
Most of the growth has happened outside the United States .
Russians are putting electrolyzed water down oil wells to kill pesky microbes .
Europeans use it to treat burn victims .
Electrolyzing equipment is helping to sanitize drinking water in parts of Latin American and Africa .
It ’s big in Japan .
People there spray it on sushi to kill bacteria and fill their swimming pools with it , eliminating the need for harsh chlorine .
Doctors use it to sterilize equipment and treat foot fungus and bedsores .
It ’s the secret weapon in Sanyo Electric Corp .'s “ soap - less ” washing machine .
Now Sanyo is bent on cleaning up Japan ’s taxis with a tiny air purifier that fits into a car ’s cup holder .
The device uses electrolyzed water to shield passengers from an unwelcome byproduct of Japan ’s binge - drinking business culture : vomit .
“ There was some concern about the spreading of viruses and bacteria via the taxi , not to mention the . . . stinky smells , ” Sanyo spokesman Aaron Fowles said .
Sanyo ’s taxi air washer is n’t yet available in the U.S. ; commuters will have to hold their noses for now .
But the U.S. Department of Agriculture , the Food and Drug Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency have approved electrolyzed water for a variety of uses .
PuriCore of Malvern , Pa. , and Oculus Innovative Sciences of Petaluma , Calif. , have developed treatments for chronic wounds .
Albuquerque , N.M. - based MIOX Corp. sells municipal water - purifying systems .
EAU Technologies Inc. of Kennesaw , Ga. , caters to both ends of a dairy cow , with alkaline water to aid the animal ’s digestion and acid water to clean up its manure .
Integrated Environmental Technologies Inc. of Little River , S.C. , is working with oil companies to keep wells free of bacteria and with high schools to sanitize sweaty wrestling mats and grungy football equipment that spread skin infections .
Electrolyzer Corp. of Woburn , Mass. , is going after the hospitality market .
The Sheraton Delfina purchased one of its machines .
So has the Hyatt Regency Chicago and the Trump International Beach Resort near Miami .
Patrick Lucci , Electrolyzer ’s vice president of marketing , likes to bombard prospects with scientific studies , then give ‘em the old razzle - dazzle .
He ’ll swig the processed salt water before he mops the floor with it .
“ Try that with bleach , ” he said .
The unit in Santa Monica looks a little like an oversized water heater , with two tanks side by side -- one for making the hypochlorous acid sanitizer , the other for the sodium hydroxide cleanser .
Rebecca Jimenez , director of housekeeping , heard grumbling from the cleaning staff when the hotel brought the machine in last fall .
Housekeepers doubted that the flat , virtually odorless liquids were really doing the job .
Some poured the guest shampoos into their bottles to work up a lather .
“ If it does n’t suds up , it does n’t work , ” Jimenez said .
“ That ’s the mentality . ”
Still , she said , most have come around and are enjoying working without fumes and peeling skin .
Minnesota food scientist Joellen Feirtag said she was similarly skeptical .
So she installed an electrolysis unit in her laboratory and began researching the technology .
She found that the acid water killed E. coli , salmonella , listeria and other nasty pathogens .
Yet it was gentle enough to soothe her children ’s sunburns and acne .
She ’s now encouraging food processors to take a look at electrolyzed water to help combat the disease outbreaks that have roiled the industry .
Most are dubious .
“ This sounds too good to be true , which is really the biggest problem , ” said Feirtag , an associate professor at the University of Minnesota .
“ But it ’s only a matter of time before this becomes mainstream . ”

Twitter is increasingly helping journalists to pick up and follow stories , but the media is not the only sector to benefit - IT professionals can get just as much out of tweeting .
The hype around the social networking tool is reaching new peaks , but Jeffrey Mann , a Gartner analyst who specialises in web collaboration , says a little over - reaction does n't mean it is n't useful to business .
He says IT staff can use it in much the same way as other business professionals - boosting their own public profile , keeping up with recent developments in the sector , and taking part in the day ’s debate .
Techno talk
And the medium itself means IT staff are more likely than those in other sectors to have an enthusiastic online community waiting for them .
Mann says a lot of techies and geeks use Twitter , so many discussions are technology - related .
The potentially huge audience of Twitter means your posts could reach a massive number of people .
As a result , users often steer clear of posting highly personal information and instead use it as a forum to explore and develop their ideas and opinions .
“ People use it to keep track of people they meet at conferences , bloggers they like , and things like that , ” says Mann .
“ But they are not asked to do it by their companies - it is not a part of their job , it is about getting ideas out there and getting their name talked about .
A lot of people are hesitant to post personal things .
It tends to be somewhere between personal and professional . ”
Get in the know
IT workers can use Twitter in the same way journalists do : to keep up with what is going on , what is new and which companies have announced a new product or the latest batch of redundancies .
It is often used as a signalling device , so users generally have to sift through the entries , find what is relevant and may have to do more work to corroborate what is being said .
Mann says , “ Things may not be discussed in depth , as it is more like chatting .
Things pop up , and people start talking about it .
There is a lot of volume and noise .
You have to pick out what is important , then take steps to find out what is really going on . ”
A useful tool
It can be helpful when there is little communication over a certain event or topic - as users of Salesforce.com found when the site went down recently .
And plenty of IT ’s highest profile figures are on Twitter , so it is a good way of keeping up with the industry ’s big thinkers .
And it could even be a way of becoming one of those big thinkers , says Mann .
“ It helps to build up your own profile and become known outside the boundaries of your company .
It could help find you a job and it contributes to your personal brand , ” he says .
Get involved
It may be worth getting involved now , if you are not already .
Mann predicts the hype around Twitter is about to come to a peak , before dropping off next year .
“ It is reaching the top of the hype cycle .
It is probably going to peak soon .
It is useful and fun , and you can see some benefits , but we are already beginning to see some alternatives such as Yammer , ” he says .
“ It will start reappearing in other forms .
Big companies and vendors are likely to introduce their own , similar sites , to use it in a more controlled way with a smaller number of users . ”
The army surrounded the BDR barracks in an upscale residential area of Dhaka
By Mark Dummett
BBC News , Dhaka
Bangladesh 's newspapers on Wednesday morning all carried pictures of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina saluting members of the country 's paramilitary border force , the Bangladesh Rifles , at their annual parade the day before .
The BDR will feature on all of Thursday 's front pages as well - but this time for turning the peaceful streets of the capital into a battle zone .
For about five hours , bullets whizzed over rooftops and the occasional thud of mortar rounds echoed along the strangely empty streets .
Dhaka is one of the most congested cities on the planet , but for once there were no traffic jams .
Instead the army had planted rows of anti-aircraft cannons at key junctions near the barracks , and heavily - armed policemen forced vehicles off the roads .
Bangladeshi border guards launched the mutiny over pay and benefits Street children pointed out patches of dried blood on a pavement .
As a military helicopter flew over the BDR headquarters - a large compound famous for its rose gardens that sits in the heart of a plush residential neighbourhood - the mutineers let rip with an almighty barrage of automatic gunfire .
A large plume of smoke billowed out of the barracks ' conference centre , where Bangladeshi news channels speculated that the men had held their commanding officers captive .
For a while , regular army units tried to fight their way into the barracks from at least two directions .
We have taken up arms to save our souls .
This is a clash between the army and the BDR because they have always exploited us .
BDR mutineer
From our position on a roof nearby we could here one of the mutineers calling out to his colleagues with a megaphone .
" Brothers , let 's stay together , " he declared .
" The army is trying to come in and we will stop them by any means . "
Later one of the men telephoned the BBC Bengali service in Dhaka .
He complained that the BDR rank and file had been mistreated by their officers , who are seconded by the regular army , for generations .
" We have taken up arms to save our souls , " the unnamed soldier said .
" This is a clash between the army and the BDR because they have always exploited us .
It has been the same thing for 200 years , " he said .
" This is not political . "
Profound implications Today 's extraordinary events certainly will have profound political implications .
Sheikh Hasina offered an amnesty to the mutineers Bangladesh has a new government which only took office in January .
It will now have the tricky task of deciding how to deal with the mutineers .
The man who called us said they were supported by 20,000 men , but that is certainly a massive exaggeration .
Nevertheless the BDR has bases around the country and thousands of men who might sympathise with the rebels .
Of equal concern to the government will be how a dispute over pay and conditions could have escalated so suddenly , surprisingly and violently .
By nightfall it seemed as if a settlement between the mutineers and the government might have been reached , with Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina personally negotiating an amnesty for the men in exchange for them laying down their weapons .
But they have not yet done that , and as the standoff at the BDR headquarters continues , the mood this night is still tense .

The Federal Government has delayed its annual statement on improving life expectancy for Indigenous Australians .
Last year the Prime Minister promised to give an annual update on the first sitting day of Parliament every year .
But there was no such statement in Parliament yesterday .
A spokeswoman for Kevin Rudd says the statement will be made next week , on the eve of the anniversary of the apology to Indigenous Australians .
Remember the bacon burger ?
You know , the burger made from ground bacon ?
Well , its creator ( who posts here sometimes as PhotoKirk ) just emailed me saying he wanted to push the envelope for 2008 , so he went pretty nuts .
He essentially made a Jucy Lucy ( cheese - stuffed patty ) from ground bacon and then DEEP - FRIED IT !
He says :
It was pretty good , but not as good as the original 100 % Bacon Burger .
I think using a smaller patty and cooking it on the grill would have been better .
Perhaps that will be Bacon Burger 3.0 ...
I do n't know , I think he 's pretty much gone as outrageous as possible and that going smaller and grilled would be a downgrade .

President Obama said there were difficult days ahead
US Republicans have broadly welcomed President Barack Obama 's plan to withdraw most troops from Iraq by 2010 .
However , they suggested he should give credit to his predecessor for stability brought by the " surge " strategy of pouring extra troops into Iraq .
House Republican Minority Leader John Boehner described the plan as responsible while remaining flexible .
Iraqi PM
Nouri al - Maliki said his forces were capable of controlling security in Iraq after US troops leave .
President Obama announced that the US " combat mission " would officially end by August 2010 .
' Responsible approach '
However , up to 50,000 of 142,000 troops now there will stay until the end of 2011 to advise Iraqi forces and protect US interests , he said .
Mr Obama praised the progress on security made but warned : " Iraq is not yet secure , and there will be difficult days ahead . "
A London - based spokesman for Mr Maliki 's party , Zuhair al - Nahar , told the BBC : " The Iraqi security forces have proved their efficiency and have proved their capability .
" In many provinces , for example in the south , you hardly see any presence of American troops and in many areas of Baghdad the same applies .
" So the Iraqi security forces have shown that they are capable of controlling the security situation . "
Among Republican support , House Republican Minority Leader John Boehner said Mr Obama had outlined " a responsible approach that retains the flexibility to reconsider troop levels and to respond to changes in the security environment " .
Republican Senator John McCain , Mr Obama 's former rival presidential candidate , said he supported the plan .
He said it was " one that can keep us on the right path in Iraq , " the Associated Press news agency reported .
He told senators : " Let us have no crisis of confidence now .
" Instead , let us welcome home our fighting men and women - not just thanking them for serving in Iraq , but congratulating them on bringing us to victory there . "
However , Democratic congressman Dennis Kucinich questioned keeping some troops in Iraq while withdrawing others .
" You can't be in and out at the same time , " he said .
Some Democrats are concerned that the timetable falls short of Mr Obama 's election pledges on troop withdrawal .
Mr Obama had said previously that he would completely pull out troops within 16 months of taking the top job in January 2009 .
In his address at Camp Lejeune , a Marine Corps base in North Carolina , Mr Obama said his national security team had drawn up a " new strategy " for US involvement in Iraq .
The strategy recognised that the long - term solution in Iraq must be political and that the most important decisions about its future must now be made by Iraqis , he said .
I asked Robert Gates , the defence secretary , whether he could look the outside world in the eye and say ' America won ! '
North America editor Justin Webb
Read Justin's thoughts in full
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid described Mr Obama 's plan as " sound and measured " but said the US " must keep in Iraq only those forces necessary for the security of our remaining troops and the Iraqi people " .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the plan was " good news " because it signalled an end to the war , but called for clearly - defined missions for the remaining troops .

Iain Dale and John Redwood represent the not - so - stupid face of the Stupid Party ; the Thatcherite blogger and the Thatcherite former cabinet minister are clearly very intelligent blokes .
Yet both display an uncharacteristic degree of political illiteracy today , founded on wilful misconstrual of what can be included under the general heading of ‘ rightwing politics ’ .
Iain – yes , we are on first name terms – has authored a post under the headline ‘ Why the BNP is Left Wing ( and Fascist ) ’ .
His reasoning runs like this :
But the fact remains that BNP beliefs DO have more in common with Socialism than with Conservatism – centralised command control , trade tariffs , state owned businesses … I could go on .
I struggle to think of a single issue which joins the BNP and mainstream conservatism .
The Nazis were called National Socialists for a reason .
Fascism is invariably described as a creed of the right .
It is n’t .
As with the BNP , fascism has far more in common with the left , at least in political theoretical terms .
That the word ‘ Nazi ’ is an abbreviation of National Socialist is frequently trumpeted by rightists as conclusive proof that Hitler was some kind of crypto-communist .
But what ’s in a name ?
Let ’s give the matter a moment ’s reflection .
Nick Clegg in Britain , Vladimir Zhirinovsky in Russia and Taro Aso in Japan are all leaders of parties that style themselves ‘ Liberal Democrats ’ .
Would Iain argue for one moment that they have some kind of common underlying political identity ?
Surely not .
Meanwhile , Redwood maintains on his website that ‘ some socialists try to distinguish communism from fascism . ’
The implication has to be that the two cannot be distinguished .
The origin of the nonsense peddled by Dale and Redwood can be located with some precision .
If you want the fullest exposition , head for chapter 12 of Hayek ’s ‘ The Road to Serfdom ’ , tellingly called ‘ The Socialist Roots of Nazism ’ .
That Hayek is the originator of the critique is itself significant .
As the Austrian economist ’s support for Pinochet ’s Chile underlines , he openly preferred free market dictatorships to social market democracies .
In his ideal polity , the full franchise would not be extended to anyone who worked for the public sector or to anyone under 45 .
In short , he was not a committed democrat .
But more importantly , his proposition that any variety of statism is ipso facto ‘ socialist ’ cannot be supported by any serious historical investigation .
Socialism by definition involves working class control of the means of production , distribution and exchange .
In both Hitler ’s Germany and Mussolini ’s Italy , the capitalist class retained beneficial ownership of the commanding heights of the economy , despite central direction .
That is how come IG Farben ended up running the chemical factories of Auschwitz as a private capitalist company , on a for - profit basis .
No wonder the bourgeoisie funded the rise of fascism to power in both instances , with the full connivance of the parties of the mainstream right .
Naturally , fascist governments make it their first task to smash the organisations of the working class , especially the socialist and communist parties and the trade unions .
Despite Redwood ’s protestations that the right is inherently democratic , layers of the Conservative Party – from the January Club in the 1930s to the Monday Club of the 1970s and the Conservative Democratic Alliance of the current decade – have always been prepared to flirt with fascism .
To underline the point , let me conclude with two quotes from Winston Churchill , a former Tory prime minister .
Both are sufficiently well - known for it to be certain that Redwood will be aware of them .
The first was addressed by Churchill to Mussolini :
If I had been an Italian , I am sure that I should have been wholeheartedly with you from the start to finish in your triumphant struggle against the bestial appetites and passions of Leninism …
Externally , your movement has rendered service to the whole world .
The second – which dates from as late as 1939 – relates to Hitler ’s rise to power :
I have always said that if Great Britain were defeated in war , I hoped we should find a Hitler to lead us back to our rightful position among nations .
I suppose , on Hayek ’s distorted logic , that is enough to make Churchill some kind of ‘ socialist ’ too .
I doubt that either Dale or Redwood would want to go quite that far .
But in short , just as the anti-Stalinist left has to face up to the reality that Stalinism originated within Marxism , the anti-fascist right needs to recognise that fascism is the bastard offspring of their tradition .
Simple denial of reality does not obviate that requirement .

Charles Oliver Nutter Java , Ruby , and JVM guy trying to make sense of it all Source About
And after you read the “ excuse ” given by the newspaper ’s editor for the dead monkey cartoon about Obama ’s economic stimulus package , you really need to check out the same cartoonist ’s other cartoons , including depicting gays as people who screw sheep , and a cartoon showing Al Qaeda celebrating the Democrats ’ electoral victory in 2006 .
This guy really exemplifies what ’s become of the conservative movement .
The best argument they can make about how to proceed in the face of our economic crisis is a racist joke about the assassination of our first black president .
The party of Limbaugh , Palin and tax - cheat plumbers lives on .
What a year for corporate criminality and malfeasance !
As we compiled the Multinational Monitor list of the 10 Worst Corporations of 2008 , it would have been easy to restrict the awardees to Wall Street firms .
But the rest of the corporate sector was not on good behavior during
2008 either , and we did n't want them to escape justified scrutiny .
So , in keeping with our tradition of highlighting diverse forms of
corporate wrongdoing , we included only one financial company on the 10
Worst list .
Here , presented in alphabetical order , are the 10 Worst Corporations of 2008 .
AIG : Money for Nothing
There 's surely no one party responsible for the ongoing global
financial crisis .
But if you had to pick a single responsible
corporation , there 's a very strong case to make for American
International Group ( AIG ) , which has already sucked up more than $ 150
billion in taxpayer supports .
Through " credit default swaps , " AIG
basically collected insurance premiums while making the ridiculous
assumption that it would never pay out on a failure -- let alone a
collapse of the entire market it was insuring .
When reality set in , the
roof caved in .
Cargill : Food Profiteers
When food prices spiked in late 2007 and through the beginning of 2008 ,
countries and poor consumers found themselves at the mercy of the
global market and the giant trading companies that dominate it .
As
hunger rose and food riots broke out around the world , Cargill saw
profits soar , tallying more than $ 1 billion in the second quarter of
2008 alone .
In a competitive market , would a grain - trading middleman make
super - profits ?
Or would rising prices crimp the middleman 's profit
margin ?
Well , the global grain trade is not competitive , and the legal
rules of the global economy -- devised at the behest of Cargill and
friends -- ensure that poor countries will be dependent on , and at the
mercy of , the global grain traders .
Chevron : " We ca n't let little countries screw around with big companies "
In 2001 , Chevron swallowed up Texaco .
It was happy to absorb the
revenue streams .
It has been less willing to take responsibility for
Texaco 's ecological and human rights abuses .
In 1993 , 30,000 indigenous Ecuadorians filed a class action suit in
U.S. courts , alleging that Texaco over a 20 - year period had poisoned
the land where they live and the waterways on which they rely , allowing
billions of gallons of oil to spill and leaving hundreds of waste pits
unlined and uncovered .
Chevron had the case thrown out of U.S. courts ,
on the grounds that it should be litigated in Ecuador , closer to where
the alleged harms occurred .
But now the case is going badly for Chevron
in Ecuador -- Chevron may be liable for more than $ 7 billion .
So , the
company is lobbying the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative to
impose trade sanctions on Ecuador if the Ecuadorian government does not
make the case go away .
" We can't let little countries screw around with big companies like
this -- companies that have made big investments around the world , " a
Chevron lobbyist said to Newsweek in August .
( Chevron subsequently
stated that the comments were not approved . )
Constellation Energy : Nuclear Operators
Although it is too dangerous , too expensive and too centralized to make
sense as an energy source , nuclear power wo n't go away , thanks to
equipment makers and utilities that find ways to make the public pay
and pay .
Constellation Energy Group , the operator of the Calvert Cliffs nuclear
plant in Maryland -- a company recently involved in a startling ,
partially derailed scheme to price gouge Maryland consumers -- plans to
build a new reactor at Calvert Cliffs , potentially the first new
reactor built in the United States since the near - meltdown at Three
Mile Island in 1979 .
It has lined up to take advantage of U.S. government - guaranteed loans
for new nuclear construction , available under the terms of the 2005
Energy Act .
The company acknowledges it could not proceed with
construction without the government guarantee .
CNPC : Fueling Violence in Darfur
Sudan has been able to laugh off existing and threatened sanctions for
the slaughter it has perpetrated in Darfur because of the huge support
it receives from China , channeled above all through the Sudanese
relationship with the Chinese National Petroleum Corporation ( CNPC ) .
" The relationship between CNPC and Sudan is symbiotic , " notes the
Washington , D.C. - based Human Rights First , in a March 2008 report ,
" Investing in Tragedy . "
" Not only is CNPC the largest investor in the
Sudanese oil sector , but Sudan is CNPC 's largest market for overseas
investment . "
Oil money has fueled violence in Darfur .
" The profitability of Sudan's
oil sector has developed in close chronological step with the violence
in Darfur , " notes Human Rights First .
Dole : The Sour Taste of Pineapple
A 1988 Filipino land reform effort has proven a fraud .
Plantation
owners helped draft the law and invented ways to circumvent its
purported purpose .
Dole pineapple workers are among those paying the
price .
Under the land reform , Dole 's land was divided among its workers and
others who had claims on the land prior to the pineapple giant .
However , wealthy landlords maneuvered to gain control of the labor
cooperatives the workers were required to form , Washington , D.C. - based
International Labor Rights Forum ( ILRF ) explains in an October report .
Dole has slashed it regular workforce and replaced them with contract
workers .
Contract workers are paid under a quota system , and earn about $ 1.85 a day , according to ILRF .
GE : Creative Accounting
In June , former New York Times reporter David Cay Johnston reported on
internal General Electric documents that appeared to show the company
had engaged in a long - running effort to evade taxes in Brazil .
In a
lengthy report in Tax Notes International , Johnston reported on a GE
subsidiary 's scheme to invoice suspiciously high sales volume for
lighting equipment in lightly populated Amazon regions of the country .
These sales would avoid higher value added taxes ( VAT ) in urban states ,
where sales would be expected to be greater .
Johnston wrote that the state - level VAT at issue , based on the internal
documents he reviewed , appeared to be less than $ 100 million .
But , he
speculated , the overall scheme could have involved much more .
Johnston did not identify the source that gave him the internal GE
documents , but GE has alleged it was a former company attorney , Adriana
Koeck .
GE fired Koeck in January 2007 for what it says were
" performance reasons . "
Imperial Sugar : 14 Dead
On February 7 , an explosion rocked the Imperial Sugar refinery in Port
Wentworth , Georgia , near Savannah .
Days later , when the fire was
finally extinguished and search - and - rescue operations completed , the
horrible human toll was finally known : 14 dead , dozens badly burned and
injured .
As with almost every industrial disaster , it turns out the tragedy was
preventable .
The cause was accumulated sugar dust , which like other
forms of dust , is highly combustible .
A month after the Port Wentworth explosion , Occupational Safety and
Health Administration ( OSHA ) inspectors investigated another Imperial
Sugar plant , in Gramercy , Louisiana .
They found 1/4 - to 2 - inch
accumulations of dust on electrical wiring and machinery .
They found as
much as 48 - inch accumulations on workroom floors .
Imperial Sugar obviously knew of the conditions in its plants .
It had
in fact taken some measures to clean up operations prior to the
explosion .
The company brought in a new vice president to clean up
operations in November 2007 , and he took some important measures to
improve conditions .
But it was n't enough .
The vice president told a
Congressional committee that top - level management had told him to tone
down his demands for immediate action .
Philip Morris International : Unshackled
The old Philip Morris no longer exists .
In March , the company formally
divided itself into two separate entities : Philip Morris USA , which
remains a part of the parent company Altria , and Philip Morris
International .
Philip Morris USA sells Marlboro and other cigarettes in
the United States .
Philip Morris International tramples the rest of the
world .
Philip Morris International has already signaled its initial plans to
subvert the most important policies to reduce smoking and the toll from
tobacco - related disease ( now at 5 million lives a year ) .
The company
has announced plans to inflict on the world an array of new products ,
packages and marketing efforts .
These are designed to undermine
smoke - free workplace rules , defeat tobacco taxes , segment markets with
specially flavored products , offer flavored cigarettes sure to appeal
to youth and overcome marketing restrictions .
Roche : " Saving lives is not our business "
The Swiss company Roche makes a range of HIV - related drugs .
One of them
is enfuvirtid , sold under the brand - name Fuzeon .
Fuzeon brought in $ 266
million to Roche in 2007 , though sales are declining .
Roche charges $ 25,000 a year for Fuzeon .
It does not offer a discount price for developing countries .
Like most industrialized countries , Korea maintains a form of price
controls -- the national health insurance program sets prices for
medicines .
The Ministry of Health , Welfare and Family Affairs listed
Fuzeon at $ 18,000 a year .
Korea 's per capita income is roughly half
that of the United States .
Instead of providing Fuzeon , for a profit ,
at Korea 's listed level , Roche refuses to make the drug available in
Korea .
Korean activists report that the head of Roche Korea told them , " We are
not in business to save lives , but to make money .
Saving lives is not
our business . "

Federal authorities have launched a civil rights investigation into several Los Angeles police officers accused of lying under oath in a drug possession case that was dismissed last year when a videotape sharply contradicted their testimony .
An FBI agent and a federal prosecutor last week surveyed a Hollywood apartment complex where a security camera documented the 2007 arrest of Guillermo Alarcon Jr. by LAPD officers , according to an attorney who represents Alarcon in a civil claim against the Police Department .
An FBI spokeswoman confirmed the existence of the probe and said that Department of Justice officials in Washington , D.C. , would ultimately weigh in on whether federal charges would be filed against the officers .
“ We ’re investigating allegations that the defendant ’s civil rights may have been violated , ” said spokeswoman Laura Eimiller .
She declined to provide further details .
Advertisement
Deputy Public Defender Victor Acevedo , Alarcon ’s defense attorney during last year ’s trial , said the FBI interviewed him about the case in December .
He said that his client had been framed and that the officers deserved to face criminal charges .
“ They have no business being police officers , ” Acevedo said .
“ Because they were willing to send an innocent man to prison , for what they did they should go to prison . ”
The officers have denied wrongdoing .
The federal investigation is but one of several probes into accusations that the officers committed perjury .
The Los Angeles County district attorney ’s office has launched its own criminal investigation and the LAPD is conducting an internal affairs review of the case .
Advertisement
Luis Carrillo , Alarcon ’s civil attorney , said the FBI had yet to interview his client but that two district attorney ’s investigators and a prosecutor interviewed Alarcon about the case in August .
At Alarcon ’s trial in June , Officers Richard Amio and Evan Samuel testified that they were on patrol in Los Angeles when they chased Alarcon , 29 , into his Hollywood apartment building .
The officers told jurors that they saw him throw away a black object .
They testified that Samuel quickly picked up the object and found about $ 260 worth of powder and crack cocaine inside .
But footage from a security camera at the apartment building , which is managed by Alarcon ’s mother , showed that officers searched for more than 20 minutes before an object allegedly containing cocaine was found .
They were aided by other officers , including Manuel Ortiz , who testified about the case at a preliminary hearing in January .
Advertisement
The quality of the tape , a copy of which was obtained by The Times , is poor and it is difficult to clearly hear what is being said .
But at one point , soon after the drugs were found , an officer seems to make a reference to the arrest report that needed to be filled out .
“ Be creative in your writing , ” the officer appears to tell another after the discovery .
Acevedo argued at trial that his client was innocent and that the officers had planted evidence and then lied about it .
Advertisement
After viewing the videotape , Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Monica Bachner dismissed the charges at the request of prosecutors .
The judge also declared Alarcon factually innocent .
Ira Salzman , an attorney representing Samuel and Ortiz , said his clients testified truthfully in the case .
He said prosecutors had concluded that the tape was edited in two places to remove about 13 seconds of sound .
Salzman cautioned that he had yet to view a complete version of the video but said that he believed that the officers did pick up an object containing drugs but continued to search for more .
Advertisement
“ They testified truthfully to the best of their ability , ” he said .
“ I believe that they ’re good officers and good men . ”
The video begins after Alarcon already had been taken into custody .
But in the police report and during their testimony , the officers mentioned finding only one object containing drugs .
LAPD Cmdr . Rick Webb , who oversees the department ’s internal affairs group , said the agency ’s probe is continuing .
He declined to comment further , citing state laws that protect the privacy of police officers accused of misconduct .

Samuel , who left the LAPD and joined the Chino Police Department in February , was fired while on probation in Chino two weeks after The Times reported on Alarcon ’s case , a Chino spokeswoman said .

The Dark Side of Overdrive
Faster is always better .
Thanks to that simple philosophy , LCD pixel response times have been driven down to puny proportions in recent years .
Today , even the slowest panels are rated at 16ms or better and deliver adequate response for all but the most fanatical PC gamers .
High performance screens , meanwhile , now trade low single - digit millisecond blows in the battle for fast response dominance .
That ’s the good news ; the bad news is that the quest for ever lower pixel response times comes with a pair of undesirable side effects : input lag and inverse ghosting .
Superficially , the two appear to be unrelated , but they share the same underlying cause .
The culprit is a response - enhancing technique known as overdrive .
Also common to both input lag and inverse ghosting is a rather murky cloud of controversy .
Some sneer at the idea that input lag even exists , while others argue that while it may exist , only pedants with a penchant for pointless whining could possibly notice it .
Unsurprisingly , the monitor manufacturers have n’t exactly been falling over themselves to talk about input lag and inverse ghosting .
The conspicuous failure of the industry to openly address these issues – whether the result of ignorance or intent – does n’t help the situation and is a problem we 've experienced ourselves during the process of writing this piece .
More on that in moment .
First , make no mistake : both input lag and inverse ghosting are very real .
We intend to lay out the evidence here to confirm that .
However , to what extent you will notice , much less be bothered by either is another question .
Scientists said Friday they believe a severe storm off the coasts of Oregon and Washington in December may be responsible for the bruised and confused California brown pelicans reported in recent weeks throughout California , far from their seaside homes .
About 4,000 of the big brown birds had enjoyed an unusually warm November in Oregon when they were suddenly hit by freezing temperatures and 60 mph winds , said David A. Jessup , senior veterinarian for the California Department of Fish and Game .
Many of the pelicans were starving and suffering from frostbite and diseases including pneumonia , bronchitis and hepatitis when they were forced to make a 1,000 - mile trip to warmer climates in Southern California .
“ A high proportion of these birds are adult , ” Jessup said , “ and quite a few have severe frostbite injuries : frozen toes and foot webs , and nasty lesions on their pouches .
Advertisement
“ They ’re in pretty good body condition otherwise .
Even confused and depressed pelicans were not showing signs of brain damage . ”
But exposure to bad weather does n’t explain all of the problems discovered in blood and tissue samples of pelicans found dead or dying on airport runways , farm fields , freeways and high in the mountains .
For example , blood samples from four of 19 ailing birds sent to USC biology professor David Caron for analysis had detectable levels of potentially fatal algae toxins such as domoic acid .
Additional tests were being conducted by the Department of Fish and Game , the National Wildlife Health Center in Madison , Wis. , the California Animal Health and Food Safety Laboratory at UC Davis and SeaWorld in San Diego .
Advertisement
Jessup said he planned to release a report on the problem within a few days .
In the meantime , wildlife rescuers from San Francisco to San Diego continued to retrieve and rehabilitate hundreds of stricken pelicans .
“ Until complete test results are available , we ’re not prepared to say what is to blame for the constellation of symptoms we ’ve been seeing in these birds , ” said Laurie Pyne , development director for the International Bird Rescue Research Center .
“ We ’re still trying to put the puzzle pieces together . ”
More than 70,000 breeding pairs of pelicans inhabit California and Baja California , Mexico , and total numbers have surged to about 620,000 birds along the West Coast , Gulf Coast and Latin and South America .

Pakistan said today it had arrested the alleged ringleader and five other suspects behind the Mumbai terror attacks that left 179 people dead as it acknowledged for the first time that they were launched from Pakistani soil .
" Some part of the conspiracy has taken place in Pakistan , " Rehman Malik , Islamabad 's top interior ministry official , told reporters .
" Most of them [ the suspects ] are in custody . "
He said investigators had traced a boat used by the attackers to reach India from Pakistan and discovered two of the suspects ' hideouts near the southern port city of Karachi .
Other leads pointed to Europe and the US and Malik said Pakistan would ask the FBI for help .
India , which has maintained that the attack was planned and carried out by militants in Pakistan , has been pressing the Pakistani government to crack down on Lashkar - e - Taiba , a Pakistan - based militant group widely blamed for the bloodshed .
Pakistan has already arrested several of its leaders .
Tracing telephone calls and bank transfers had led to the capture of a key figure in the conspiracy , Hammad Amin Sadiq , Malik said .
" He was basically the main operator , " Malik said , adding that his interrogation led to the raid on the two hideouts , one in Karachi , and the other two hours ' drive way .
Malik said the breakthrough in the investigation came when the authorities traced the fishing boat used by the militants , and purchases of equipment such as life jackets and the engine for the rubber dinghy used by them to go ashore in Mumbai , India 's financial centre .
" They had some kind of training , they went into the ocean , " Malik said , saying they had sailed from Karachi .
" Some of the accused who have been arrested … have given us the full rundown . "
Malik said investigators had been unable to establish the identities of the nine gunmen killed in the attack last November , although Pakistan has confirmed that Mohammad Ajmal Kasab , the gunman caught alive , was a Pakistani .
He added that the evidence collected made a connection to the leadership of Lashkar - e - Taiba , including Zaki-ur - Rehman Lakhvi and Zarrar Shah , who India says masterminded the attacks .
The Indian foreign ministry said that the information would be studied before any reaction was given .
Pakistan released the results of its investigation as Richard Holbrooke , Barack Obama 's special envoy to Pakistan and Afghanistan , finished a four - day visit to the country .
Holbrooke was scheduled to arrive in Kabul today and is due to visit India next week on the final leg of a regional tour to devise a new strategy for stabilising the region .
Newsline
A stern , unyielding version of Islam is replacing the kinder , gentler Islam of the Sufis in Pakistan .
The common belief in Pakistan is that Islamic radicalism is a problem only in FATA , and that madrassas are the only institutions serving as jihad factories .
This is a serious misconception .
Extremism is breeding at a ferocious rate in public and private schools within Pakistan ’s towns and cities .
Left unchallenged , this education will produce a generation incapable of co-existing with anyone except strictly their own kind .
The mindset it creates may eventually lead to Pakistan ’s demise as a nation state .
For 20 years or more , a few of us have been desperately sending out SOS messages , warning of terrible times to come .
In fact , I am surprised at how rapidly these dire predictions have come true .
A full - scale war is being fought in FATA , Swat and other “ wild ” areas of Pakistan , resulting in thousands of deaths .
It is only a matter of time before this fighting shifts to Peshawar and Islamabad ( which has already been a witness to the Lal Masjid episode ) and engulfs Lahore and Karachi as well .
The suicide bomber and the masked abductor have crippled Pakistan ’s urban life and shattered its national economy .
Soldiers , policemen , factory and hospital workers , mourners at funerals and ordinary people praying in mosques have all been reduced to globs of flesh and fragments of bones .
But , perhaps paradoxically , in spite of the fact that the dead bodies and shattered lives are almost all Muslim ones , few Pakistanis speak out against these atrocities .
Nor do they approve of the army operation against the cruel perpetrators of these acts because they believe that they are Islamic warriors fighting for Islam and against American occupation .
Political leaders like Nawaz Sharif and Imran Khan have no words of solace for those who have suffered at the hands of Islamic extremists .
Their tears are reserved exclusively for the victims of Predator drones , even if they are those who committed grave crimes against their own people .
Terrorism , by definition , is an act only the Americans can commit .
What explains Pakistan ’s collective masochism ?
To understand this , one needs to study the drastic social and cultural transformations that have rendered this country so completely different from what it was in earlier times .
For three decades , deep tectonic forces have been silently tearing Pakistan away from the Indian subcontinent and driving it towards the Arabian peninsula .
This continental drift is not physical but cultural , driven by a belief that Pakistan must exchange its South Asian identity for an Arab - Muslim one .
Grain by grain , the desert sands of Saudi Arabia are replacing the rich soil that had nurtured a magnificent Muslim culture in India for a thousand years .
This culture produced Mughul architecture , the Taj Mahal , the poetry of Asadullah Khan Ghalib , and much more .
Now a stern , unyielding version of Islam ( Wahhabism ) is replacing the kinder , gentler Islam of the Sufis and saints who had walked on this land for hundreds of years .
This change is by design .
Twenty - five years ago , the Pakistani state used Islam as an instrument of state policy .
Prayers in government departments were deemed compulsory , floggings were carried out publicly , punishments were meted out to those who did not fast in Ramadan , selection for academic posts in universities required that the candidate demonstrate a knowledge of Islamic teachings and jihad was declared essential for every Muslim .
Today , government intervention is no longer needed because of a spontaneous groundswell of Islamic zeal .
The notion of an Islamic state – still in an amorphous and diffused form – is more popular now than ever before as people look desperately for miracles to rescue a failing state .
Villages have changed drastically ; this transformation has been driven , in part , by Pakistani workers returning from Arab countries .
Many village mosques are now giant madrassas that propagate hard - line Salafi and Deobandi beliefs through oversized loudspeakers .
They are bitterly opposed to Barelvis , Shias and other sects , who they do not regard as Muslims .
The Punjabis , who were far more liberal towards women than the Pukhtuns , are now beginning to take a line resembling that of the Taliban .
Hanafi law has begun to prevail over tradition and civil law , as is evident from the recent decisions of the Lahore High Court .
In Pakistan ’s lower - middle and middle classes lurks a grim and humourless Saudi - inspired revivalist movement that frowns on any and every expression of joy and pleasure .
Lacking any positive connection to culture and knowledge , it seeks to eliminate “ corruption ” by regulating cultural life and seizing control of the education system .
“ Classical music is on its last legs in Pakistan ; the sarangi and vichitraveena are completely dead , ” laments Mohammad Shehzad , a music aficionado .
Indeed , teaching music in public universities is violently opposed by students of the Islami Jamaat - e - Talaba at Punjab University .
So the university has been forced to hold its music classes elsewhere .
Religious fundamentalists consider music haram or un -Islamic .
Kathak dancing , once popular with the Muslim elite of India , has few teachers left .
Pakistan produces no feature films of any consequence .
Nevertheless , the Pakistani elite , disconnected from the rest of the population , live their lives in comfort through their vicarious proximity to the West .
Alcoholism is a chronic problem of the super rich of Lahore – a curious irony for this deeply religious country .
Islamisation of the state and the polity was supposed to have been in the interest of the ruling class – a classic strategy for preserving it from the wrath of the working class .
But the amazing success of the state is turning out to be its own undoing .
Today , it is under attack from religious militants , and rival Islamic groups battle each other with heavy weapons .
Ironically , the same army – whose men were recruited under the banner of jihad , and which saw itself as the fighting arm of Islam – today stands accused of betrayal and is almost daily targeted by Islamist suicide bombers .
Pakistan ’s self - inflicted suffering comes from an education system that , like Saudi Arabia ’s system , provides an ideological foundation for violence and future jihadists .
It demands that Islam be understood as a complete code of life , and creates in the mind of a school - going child a sense of siege and embattlement by stressing that Islam is under threat everywhere .
On the previous page , the reader can view the government - approved curriculum .
This is the basic road map for transmitting values and knowledge to the young .
By an act of parliament passed in 1976 , all government and private schools ( except for O - level schools ) are required to follow this curriculum .
It was prepared by the curriculum wing of the federal ministry of education , government of Pakistan .
It sounds like a blueprint for a religious fascist state .
Alongside are scanned pictures from an illustrated primer for the Urdu alphabet .
The masthead states that it has been prepared by Iqra Publishers , Rawalpindi , along “ Islamic lines . ”
Although not an officially approved textbook , it is being used currently by some regular schools , as well as madrassas associated with the Jamiat Ulema - e - Islam ( JUI ) , an Islamic political party that had allied itself with General Musharraf .
These picture scans have been taken from a child ’s book , hence the scribbles .
The world of the Pakistani schoolchild remained largely unchanged , even after September 11 , 2001 , the event that led to Pakistan ’s timely desertion of the Taliban and the slackening of the Kashmir jihad .
Indeed , for all his hypocritical talk of “ enlightened moderation , ” General Musharraf ’s educational curriculum was far from enlightening .
It was a slightly toned down version of the curriculum that existed under Nawaz Sharif which , in turn , was identical to that under Benazir Bhutto who had inherited it from General Zia -ul - Haq .
Fearful of taking on the powerful religious forces , every incumbent government has refused to take a position on the curriculum and thus quietly allowed young minds to be moulded by fanatics .
What may happen a generation later has always been a secondary issue for a government challenged on so many fronts .
The promotion of militarism in Pakistan ’s so - called “ secular ” public schools , colleges and universities had a profound effect upon young minds .
Militant jihad became part of the culture on college and university campuses .
Armed groups flourished , they invited students for jihad in Kashmir and Afghanistan , set up offices throughout the country , collected funds at Friday prayers and declared a war which knew no borders .
Pre -9/11 , my university was ablaze with posters inviting students to participate in the Kashmir jihad .
Post - 2001 , this ceased to be done openly .
Still , the primary vehicle for Saudi-ising Pakistan ’s education has been the madrassa .
In earlier times , these had turned out the occasional Islamic scholar , using a curriculum that essentially dates back to the 11th century , with only minor subsequent revisions .
But their principal function had been to produce imams and muezzins for mosques , and those who eked out an existence as ‘ maulvi sahibs ’ teaching children to read the Quran .
The Afghan jihad changed everything .
During the war against the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan , madrassas provided the US - Saudi - Pakistani alliance the cannon fodder they needed to fight a holy war .
The Americans and Saudis , helped by a more - than - willing General Zia , funded new madrassas across the length and breadth of Pakistan .
A detailed picture of the current situation is not available .
But according to the national education census , which the ministry of education released in 2006 , Punjab has 5,459 madrassas followed by the NWFP with 2,843 ; Sindh has 1,935 ; the Federally Administrated Northern Areas ( FANA ) , 1,193 ; Balochistan , 769 ; Azad Jammu and Kashmir ( AJK ) , 586 ; the Federally Administrated Tribal Areas ( FATA ) , 135 ; and the Islamabad capital territory , 77 .
The ministry estimates that 1.5 million students are acquiring religious education in the 13,000 madrassas .
These figures appear to be way off the mark .
Commonly quoted figures range between 18,000 and 22,000 madrassas .
The number of students could be correspondingly larger .
The free boarding and lodging plus provision of books to the students , is a key part of their appeal .
Additionally , parents across the country desire that their children be “ disciplined ” and given a thorough Islamic education .
The madrassas serve this purpose , too , exceedingly well .
Madrassas have deeply impacted the urban environment .
Until a few years ago , Islamabad was a quiet , orderly , modern city different from the rest of Pakistan .
Also , it had largely been the abode of Pakistan ’s elite and foreign diplomats .
But the rapid transformation of its demography brought with it hundreds of mosques with multi- barrelled audio - cannons mounted on minarets , as well as scores of madrassas illegally constructed in what used to be public parks and green areas .
Now , tens of thousands of their students , sporting little prayer caps , dutifully chant the Quran all day .
In the evenings they swarm the city , making women minus the hijab increasingly nervous .
Total segregation of the sexes is a central goal of the Islamists , the consequences of which have been catastrophic .
For example , on April 9 , 2006 , 21 women and eight children were crushed to death and scores injured in a stampede inside a three - storey madrassa in Karachi , where a large number of women were attending a weekly congregation .
Male rescuers , who arrived in ambulances , were prevented from moving the injured women to hospitals .
One cannot dismiss this incident as being just one of a kind .
In fact , soon after the October 2005 earthquake , as I walked through the destroyed city of Balakot , a student of the Frontier Medical College described to me how he and his male colleagues were stopped by religious elders from digging out injured girl students from under the rubble of their school building .
This action was similar to that of Saudi Arabia ’s ubiquitous religious ‘ mutaween ’ ( police ) who , in March 2002 , had stopped school girls from leaving a blazing building because they were not wearing their abayas – a long robe worn in Saudi Arabia .
In a rare departure from the norm , Saudi newspapers had blamed and criticised the mutaween for letting 15 girls burn to death .
The Saudi-isation of a once - vibrant Pakistani culture continues at a relentless pace .
The drive to segregate is now also being found among educated women .
Vigorous proselytisers carrying this message , such as Mrs Farhat Hashmi , have been catapulted to the heights of fame and fortune .
Their success is evident .
Two decades back , the fully veiled student was a rarity on Pakistani university and college campuses .
The abaya was an unknown word in Urdu .
Today , some shops across the country specialise in abayas .
At colleges and universities across Pakistan , the female student is seeking the anonymity of the burqa .
And in some parts of the country she seems to outnumber her sisters who still “ dare ” to show their faces .
I have observed the veil profoundly affect habits and attitudes .
Many of my veiled female students have largely become silent note - takers , are increasingly timid and seem less inclined to ask questions or take part in discussions .
They lack the confidence of a young university student .
While social conservatism does not necessarily lead to violent extremism , it does shorten the distance .
The socially conservative are more easily convinced that Muslims are being demonised by the rest of the world .
The real problem , they say , is the plight of the Palestinians , the decadent and discriminatory West , the Jews , the Christians , the Hindus , the Kashmir issue , the Bush doctrine – the list runs on .
They vehemently deny that those committing terrorist acts are Muslims , and if presented with incontrovertible evidence , say it is a mere reaction to oppression .
The immediate future does not appear hopeful : increasing numbers of mullahs are creating cults around themselves and seizing control of the minds of worshippers .
In the tribal areas , a string of new Islamist leaders have suddenly emerged : Baitullah Mehsud , Maulana Fazlullah and Mangal Bagh .
Poverty , deprivation , lack of justice and extreme differences of wealth provide the perfect environment for these demagogues to recruit people to their cause .
Their gruesome acts of terror are still being perceived by large numbers of Pakistanis merely as a war against imperialist America .
This could not be further from the truth .
In the long term , we will have to see how the larger political battle works out between those Pakistanis who want an Islamic theocratic state and those who want a modern Islamic republic .
It may yet be possible to roll back those Islamist laws and institutions that have corroded Pakistani society for over 30 years and to defeat its hate - driven holy warriors .
There is no chance of instant success ; perhaps things may have to get worse before they get better .
But , in the long term , I am convinced that the forces of irrationality will cancel themselves out because they act at random whereas reason pulls only in one direction .
History leads us to believe that reason will triumph over unreason , and the evolution of the humans into a higher and better species will continue .
Using ways that we cannot currently anticipate , they will somehow overcome their primal impulses of territoriality , tribalism , religiosity and nationalism .
But , for now , this must be just a matter of faith .
There is a film from the mid-Eighties which is well worth watching again .
Brewster 's Millions stars Richard Pryor as a man challenged with spending $ 30 million in 30 days if he wants to inherit $ 300 million .
It 's harder than it sounds .
The will of his eccentric uncle stipulates that , at the end of the process , he must have nothing of value to show for his spending spree .
With only the help of a little charitable giving and some gambling , it must all disappear as if into thin air .

President - elect Barack Obama boards his plane in Washington January 16 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Jim Young
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Authorities on Friday arrested a U.S. man on suspicion of threatening to kill President - elect Barack Obama based on statements he posted on a website about UFOs and aliens , the Justice Department said .
Steven Joseph Christopher , in three postings to www.alien-earth.org, said he planned to assassinate Obama in Washington “ as a sacrificial lamb , ” the department said in a statement .
“ It ’s really nothing personal about the man .
He speaks well ... .
But I know it ’s for the country ’s own good that I do this , ” Christopher reportedly wrote .
“ It ’s not because I ’m racist that I will kill Barack , it ’s because I can no longer allow the Jewish parasites to bully their way into making the American people submit to their evil ways . ”
Christopher added that he needed money to get to Washington and that he did not own a gun , the department said .
Unprecedented security surrounds Obama , who will be sworn into office on Tuesday and become the nation ’s first black president .
Christopher , who is from Wisconsin but was arrested in Brookhaven , Mississippi , could face up to five years in prison and a $ 250,000 fine if found guilty .
ROTHERA BASE , Antarctica ( Reuters ) - Economic downturn is curbing tourism to Antarctica in a respite to a long - term surge that environmentalists want to cap to avert damage to the world ’s last big wilderness .

The number of visitors to the icy continent is likely to fall to 39,000 in the 2008 - 09 summer season from a record 46,000 a year ago , according to the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators ( IAATO ) .
“ It ’s been impacted by recession , ” Steve Wellmeier , executive director of the association , said in a telephone interview .
He projected that numbers could rebound to 43,000 next season but not challenge the record until 2011 or 2012 .
First seen by sailors only in 1820 , Antarctica has been drawing ever more rich tourists with wildlife such as penguins and seals along with jagged mountains , glaciers and icebergs .
Fewer than 1,000 a year visited until the early 1980s .
Environmentalists and some nations want tighter controls to protect visitors and wildlife .
Worries include shipwrecks , oil spills and an aggravation of stresses on animals and plants that may already be suffering from global warming .
“ The growth trajectory for tourism has been too steep , ” said Jim Barnes , head of the Antarctic and Southern Ocean Coalition ( ASOC ) , which groups 100 environmental organizations .
“ Sooner rather than later ( governments ) will need to address the issue of overall visitor numbers , ” ASOC wrote in a submission to the 47 members of the Antarctic Treaty before an annual meeting in Baltimore from April 6 - 17 .
CAPS ON VISITOR NUMBERS
“ ASOC would prefer to see a conservative overall figure that is in the order of magnitude of present total numbers , ” it said .
Some governments have spoken of caps but have not set numbers .
But the tourist association says fears are exaggerated .
“ We ’re talking about a continent that is larger than Australia and we ’re talking about a number of tourists that would fill a football stadium , ” Wellmeier said .
“ Seriously , is this a number for concern ? ”
Wellmeier said there was no evidence that tourism damaged Antarctica .
Still , governments are worried even though many agree that tour operators have set themselves strict standards .
And almost all tourist visits are to the peninsula , the part of the southern hemisphere that has warmed most in the past 50 years , apparently because of global climate change stoked by human use of fossil fuels .
“ The increase in visitor numbers is in the context of global warming .
The presence of visitors enhances the risks to the environment , ” said Yves Frenot , deputy head of the French Polar Institute .
Visitors could inadvertently bring in new seeds or spores -- even diseases -- that might gain a foothold in a slightly warmer environment .
And accidents including the first sinking off Antarctica of a cruise ship , the MV Explorer , in November 2007 highlighted risks for tourists .
More than 150 passengers and crew were rescued before the vessel sank off King George Island .
In another incident , a Norwegian cruise ship ran aground on Deception Island off Antarctica in early 2007 .
Apart from tourists , several thousand scientists , other staff and some reporters also visit .
The Rothera base on the Antarctic peninsula run by the British Antarctic Survey , for instance , has about 100 summer staff .
Among exotic draws , the clear Antarctic air lacks almost all smell -- there is nearly no vegetation or pollution .
Colors are largely limited to white snow , blue sky or sea and dark rocks .
On the shore the sound is sometimes a fizzing as thousands of bubbles from thawing icebergs pop at the surface .
Jose Retamales , head of the Chilean Antarctic Institute , criticized use of large cruise liners off Antarctica .
Non-binding guidelines say operators must have their own search and rescue backups -- many tour ships stay within range of each other .
SHIPS STAYING CLEAR OF ICEBERGS
“ I ’m worried about some excesses , ” he said .
“ Just 200 people aboard a vessel is a big risk . ”
The biggest ships , run by Princess Cruises , have more than 3,000 people aboard .
Wellmeier said such vessels were modern , stayed clear of icebergs and do not let tourists land on Antarctica .
Instead , they view the coast through binoculars .
Smaller cruise ships moor just offshore and run small fuel - sipping inflatable launches to land , enabling tourists to make day trips ashore and return to their cabins overnight .
There are no hotels in Antarctica and IAATO opposes any construction -- in line with a treaty for protecting the Antarctic environment .
The few tourists who visit the interior stay in tents .
Scientific bases , such as at Rothera , have hotel - like rooms for scientists and visitors , with two to a room .
The United States -- from where a third of all tourists come -- wants measures including a ban on landings by vessels with more than 500 people aboard .
Among other proposals preferred by some nations are that all vessels should have ice - hardened hulls , should burn only light diesel fuels , and that lifeboats should have covers to protect against the cold .
A few visitors go inland .
“ We aim to leave only footprints , take back only photos and memories , ” said Keith Heger of PolarExplorers , who led five people to ski the last 110 kilometers ( 68 miles ) to the South Pole in January .
“ Trash and even human waste created is brought out . ”
Bad weather forced the group to abandon a climb of Mount Vinson , Antarctica ’s highest peak at 4,897 meters ( 16,070 ft ) .
The fee to take part in a similar trip next season -- $ 67,000 .
Summer temperatures at Rothera are around zero degrees Celsius ( 32 Fahrenheit ) , with top temperatures of about 7 Celsius ( 44.6 Fahrenheit ) .
It rains nearly as frequently as it snows .
Tourists visit the South Pole in summer , when temperatures are around minus 40 Celsius ( - 40 F ) .
Polish businessman and climbing instructor Rafal Szczepanik , aged 32 and on the trip , reckoned it was probably less - environmentally damaging than flying to the tropics and staying in an air - conditioned hotel .
“ You probably produce more carbon dioxide in a four - star Caribbean hotel than you do walking in Antarctica , ” he said .

Achilles , Tortoise and Yessenin - Volpin February 16 , 2009
Posted by Alexandre Borovik in Uncategorized
[ moved here from the old blog ]
I quote a description of Zeno ’s “ Achilles and Tortoise ” paradox from Wikipedia :
“ In a race , the quickest runner can never overtake the slowest , since the pursuer must first reach the point whence the pursued started , so that the slower must always hold a lead . ” ( Aristotle Physics VI:9 , 239b15 )
In the paradox of Achilles and the Tortoise , we imagine the Greek hero Achilles in a footrace with the plodding reptile .
Because he is so fast a runner , Achilles graciously allows the tortoise a head start of a hundred feet .
If we suppose that each racer starts running at some constant speed ( one very fast and one very slow ) , then after some finite time , Achilles will have run a hundred feet , bringing him to the tortoise ’s starting point ; during this time , the tortoise has “ run ” a ( much shorter ) distance , say one foot .
It will then take Achilles some further period of time to run that distance , during which the tortoise will advance farther ; and then another period of time to reach this third point , while the tortoise moves ahead .
Thus , whenever Achilles reaches somewhere the tortoise has been , he still has farther to go .
Therefore , Zeno says , swift Achilles can never overtake the tortoise .
Thus , while common sense and common experience would hold that one runner can catch another , according to the above argument , he cannot ; this is the paradox .
Scott Aaronson ’s post in his blog Shtetl - Optimized “ And they say complexity has no philosophical implications ” ( see more about it below ) reminded me that the most natural approach to the paradox is complexity - theoretic .
Indeed , we have two different timescales : the one , in which the motion of Achilles and the Tortoise takes place , and another one , in which we discuss their motion , repeating again and again
“ it will then take Achilles some further period of time to run that distance , during which the tortoise will advance farther “ .
Clearly , each our utterance takes time bounded from below by a non -zero constant ; therefore the sum of the lengths of our utterances diverges .
However , our personal time flow has no relevance to the physical time of the motion !
Well , probably this explanation of the paradox is well - known , but the reason why I am writing this post is the next , even more fascinating story mentioned in Shtetl - Optimized .
In a sense , it is dual to the Achilles and Tortoise paradox ( and perhaps the duality could be made explicit ) .
It is told in Harvey M. Friedman ’s lectures Philosophical Problems in Logic .
Friedman said :
I have seen some ultrafinitists go so far as to challenge the existence of 2100 as a natural number , in the sense of there being a series of “ points ” of that length .
There is the obvious “ draw the line ” objection , asking where in 21 , 22 , 23 , … , 2100 do we stop having “ Platonistic reality ” ?
Here this … is totally innocent , in that it can be easily be replaced by 100 items ( names ) separated by commas .
I raised just this objection with the ( extreme ) ultrafinitist Yessenin - Volpin during a lecture of his .
He asked me to be more specific .
I then proceeded to start with 21 and asked him whether this is “ real ” or something to that effect .
He virtually immediately said yes .
Then I asked about 22 , and he again said yes , but with a perceptible delay .
Then 23 , and yes , but with more delay .
This continued for a couple of more times , till it was obvious how he was handling this objection .
Sure , he was prepared to always answer yes , but he was going to take 2100 times as long to answer yes to 2100 then he would to answering 21 .
There is no way that I could get very far with this .
Yessenin - Volpin ’s response makes it clear that the Achilles and the Tortoise paradox is not so much about the actual infinity as of a potential infinity ( or just plain technical feasibility ) of producing the sequence
1/2 , 1/4 , 1/8 , 1/16 , etc .
in real time .
I agree with Scott Aaronson : and they say complexity has no philosophical implications !
However , there is yet another layer in this story .
Anonymous said in a discussion in Shtetl - Optimized :
What a beautifully clever way to respond to such a line of questioning !
Well , one should remember that Alexander Yessenin - Volpin ( listed in Wikipedia as Esenin - Volpin ) was one of the founding fathers of the Soviet human rights movement and spent many years in prisons , exile and psychiatric hospitals .
He knows a thing or two about interrogations ; in 1968 , he wrote and circulated via Samizdat the famous “ Memo for those who expects to be interrogated “ , much used by fellow dissidents .
It is remarkable how the personality of a mathematician can be imprinted on his work and his philosophical views .
Indeed , Alexander Sergeevich Yessenin - Volpin was also a pote of note .
One of his poems , a very clever and bitterly ironic rendition of Edgar Alan Poe ‘s The Raven , is quite revealing in the context of our discussion .
I give here only the first two and the last three lines of the poem .
( A full text of the poem ( in Russian ) can be found here and here . )
Как -то ночью , в час террора , я читал впервы е
Мора ,
Чтоб Утопии незнанье мне не ставили в укор … [ … ] …
Но зато как просто гаркнул чёрный ворон : « Nеvеrmоrе ! »
И вожу , вожу я тачку , повторяя : « Nеvеrmоrе … »
Не подняться… « Nеvеrmore ! »
To make these lines more friendly to the English speaking reader , I explain that the first two lines refer to Thomas More ‘s Utopia : the protagonist reads Utopia to avoid an accusation that he has not familiarized himself with the utopian teachings promoted by the totalitarian system .
The three exclamations “ Nevermore ! ” which end the poem do not need translation .
The poem is written in 1948 ( by a remarkable coincidence , the year when George Orwell wrote his 1984 — the title of the novel is just a permutation of digits ; in 1949 , when Orwel ’s novel was published , Yessenin - Volpin started his first spell in prisons ) .
As we can see , Yessenin - Volpin , who was 23 years old at the time , developed an ultrafinitist approach to utopian theories ( and especially to the utopian practice ) much earlier than to problems of mathematical logic .

If you do n’t know by now , Rachel Maddow is the world ’s most unlikely cable news talk - show host .
For one thing , she does n’t watch TV .
And she ’s young ( 35 ) , is a Rhodes scholar with a PhD from Oxford , and is openly gay — an industry first .
( More than one friend has told me that her ascent is some consolation for the passage of California ’s anti-gay - marriage Prop 8 . )
But her combination of lefty sensibilities , a hipster vibe , wicked smarts , and genuine good cheer has taken the entire country by storm .
She ’s made msnbc competitive against cnn ‘s Larry King for the first time .
Existing in the space between Jim Lehrer ’s NewsHour and Jon Stewart ’s Daily Show , Maddow ’s hour - long show privileges reporters and actual experts over pundits , real information over blather and fake fights , and comes with healthy sides of sass and sarcasm .
It ’s a mix she learned at the left - of - center radio network Air America , where she still broadcasts a live show each weekday .
In her spare time , Maddow ’s writing a book on the role of politics in the US military .
In her other spare time , she ’s an enthusiast of graphic novels and mixology .
An extended interview is available here .
— Clara Jeffery
Mother Jones :
You ’re TV’s “ It Girl . ”
Why did your popularity take off so explosively ?
Rachel Maddow : Two things happened .
One , I opened up an umbrella factory at the start of monsoon season .
The other thing was that Keith Olbermann ’s ratings are off the charts , so I have the best lead - in in cable news .
I just hit the contextual lottery .
MJ : You ’ve risen to fame critiquing the Bush administration .
Will your show change without that foil ?
RM : As if Fox News did really poorly with Bush in the White House ?
Not having the campaign to cover is the biggest change .
But there ’s probably been , I do n’t know , three days in the nine years I ’ve been in radio where I ’ve felt like I was reaching , and that ’s usually because I ’m hungover .
MJ : You ’ve widened the circle of commentators you deem worthy of talking to .
RM :
The good thing about being — I do n’t want to call myself a pioneer , so I wo n’t , but you know what I mean — is that you get to bring your peeps with you .
And it ’s not out of some effort at affirmative action , but you represent your own experience .
MJ : You ’re representing on a lot of different fronts : women , youngish people , gays and lesbians , lefties , Oxford PhDs , comic book enthusiasts …
RM : People who are n’t conventionally attractive or a size zero , people with unruly hair .
MJ : That must be a lot of pressure .
RM : Well , it would be if I thought about it .
But it ’s just me and my conscience .
That ’s my only real audience .
I care about what my girlfriend thinks , and my friends , but ultimately it ’s me in the mirror .
MJ : Speaking of mirrors , you changed your look a lot for TV .
How was that handled ?
RM :
It was n’t at anybody else ’s encouraging .
I wanted my appearance to not be the only thing people would pay attention to .
So essentially I was seeking genericness .
MJ : Will women eventually be able to host a show and wear glasses ?
RM : I ’m not sure msnbc would stop me from wearing my glasses now if I wanted to .
The problem is technical , in that the frames are cheap plastic and they reflect .
MJ : Although in the Kennedy era , everybody wore big , chunky glasses on air .
RM : Women or was it all dudes ?
MJ : It was all dudes .
RM : I mean , I ’m sort of in “ Dude Looks Like a Lady ” territory anyway .
MJ : Still , it ’s nice that you have a hipster sensibility .
There ’s something so homogenized about the news on every level .
RM : Working in news is a homogenizing lifestyle — that ’s part of the problem .
People say , “ You seem too normal . ”
Well , yeah , I ’ve been in this industry for six weeks .
Wait until I ’ve been working 14 - hour days and having no outside life for five years .
MJ : While at Stanford you were disastrously outed :
You ’d asked the interviewer to hold a story on being gay until you could tell your parents , but they did n’t .
How does that make you feel about outing ?
RM : Well , that was more of a bumbling issue than an outing issue .
I do n’t think they did it out of malice .
It was a student paper , and it just happened .
Somebody did mail the interview to my parents , which was , I think , a malicious act , but you can spend your life being mad or you can realize you were dumb and did n’t protect yourself .
MJ : But as the first lesbian talk - show news host …
I do n’t know what title you ’d use …
RM : It ’s a very small glass ceiling I ’ve broken .
MJ : [ Laughs . ]
… And the issue in general ?
RM : I ’m in favor of outing when people have demonized or scapegoated gay people for their own public gain .
I do n’t think just being a Republican is reason enough .
MJ : You ’ve been an activist .
Is being a journalist influenced by progressive values the same thing ?
RM : No .
Activism is setting a goal of something you would like to be different , and figuring out what would have to change to achieve that goal .
It ’s sort of like math .
What I ’m doing in broadcasting is n’t anything like that .
The only thing I ’m trying to change in the world is to increase the amount of useful information in it .
And entertainment , honestly .
MJ : Speak of your love of Pat Buchanan .
RM : Aww .
Pat is a good debater , and I love that , and he has strong beliefs .
He listens to people who disagree with him and he ’s not condescending .
MJ : He has a great laugh .
RM : He does .
And he knows a lot .
You want to talk Watergate ?
He was there .
You want to talk culture war ?
That was him .
Southern strategy , comma , Buchanan .
MJ : Does he get it when you introduce him with an “ It ’s Pat ! ” headline ?
RM : We ’ve never talked TV shows , so I do n’t know if he ’s an snl guy .
MJ : You ’re writing a book about the influence of politics on the US Military .
How is it changing ?
RM : My central thesis is that we need more politics in the military .
This idea of “ the foreign policy consensus ” gave Congress an excuse to be hands - off about deploying armed forces for reasons that never got debated and were often scandalous when they came to light .
The number of Iraq veterans who ran for Congress this year ?
Holy shit .
To have the Democratic Party become the party of the veterans ?
There ’s a realignment happening at the urging of members of the military who are sick of being used .
MJ : Olbermann just renegotiated his contract for a reported $ 7.5 million a year .
When do you get to renegotiate ?
RM : For $ 7.5 million ?
Ha !
It remains to be seen whether I ’m a flash in the pan .
MJ : Is smart the new black ?
RM : [ Laughs . ]
Black is the new black .
PATNA , India–Eight members of a man 's poverty - ridden family were shot and beheaded and their bodies were thrown into a river in eastern India after he secretly married a wealthy girl , police said yesterday .
Police in the eastern state of Bihar found the eight bodies floating in a river and have charged 15 people , mostly from the girl 's family , with the killings .
The weekend killings took place after 21 - year - old Ratan Mandal and 18 - year - old Kanchan Kumari got married in secret , afraid their families would not approve because of an old social rivalry .
" The girl 's family invited the boy 's family for a meeting on the pretext of settling the dispute , but killed all eight and beheaded them , " said Raghunath Prasad Singh , a senior police officer from Bhagalpur , where the incident took place .
Bhagalpur , one of India 's most lawless regions , has been notorious for revenge killings .
Men and women have been killed in the villages of eastern and northern India for marrying outside their caste or against their families ' wishes .
Last May , a young couple was killed by the girl 's family in northern India for marrying within the same village .

Prosecutors accuse the barman of having also served alcohol illegally to youths on 173 occasions in 2005 - 2007 .
卒業していく君へ 。
卒業おめでとう。本当は面と向かって言ったほうが良いのだけど先生という立場だと私の発言が思った以上に重くなってしまうので直接君にはいえない。でも、君への言葉を一度形にしておかないと私の頭に一生こびりつきそうなのでここに書かせてもらうよ。
今年、君は卒論に苦しんだね。君が卒論に苦しんだ理由は自分でも分かっていると思うけど、常に外部に正解を求めたことにあるんだ。私が「どうして、それが正しいと思うの？その理由を教えて。」と聞くと、いつも君は表情を凍らせて黙ってしまったね。何度も何度も「研究には正解とか不正解とかない。誰も答えを知らないから研究になっているんだ。だから、自分の主張をとりあえず述べて、相手の反論が正しいと思えてから自分は間違っていたと考えれば良いんだよ。」と伝えたのだけど、 最期 最後まで君は自分の主張の正しさを自分の言葉で言えず、常に私の保証を求めたね。はっきり言ってそれが私にとっては本当につらかった。
君が雑談ならば私とも明るくおしゃべりできるのに、研究の話となった瞬間に凍り付いてしまうのは、雑談は自分の感情をベースに話せるので自信を持てる（自分の感情だもの、正しいも正しくないもない）のに対して、研究の話は自信がないからだよ。
どうして、自信がなかったのかといえば、たぶん、間違うことに対して恐怖をいだいているからだと思うよ。何で間違うことに対して恐怖を抱いているのかというと、まだ君には精神的な背骨が育っていないからだと思う。君は、自分の価値判断の基準を外部に委ねており、自分の内部にそれがない。君が自分の価値判断の基準だと思っているのは、外部に依存した「優等生な自分」「良くできる自分」という役に立たない基準なんだ。
もちろん 、 「良く出来る自分」というものをきっちりと咀嚼し、自分の精神的な背骨にしている人は大勢いる。でも、君のは、「他人が君をどう思うか」という基準なんだ。精神的な背骨として使えるのは「自分が自分をどう思うか」というものなんだ。ざっくり言えば、他人が君のことをかっこ悪いと思っていても自分が自分のことをかっこよいと思っていれば動じないというもの。何をもってかっこよいとするかは、親の見方、彼女の見方、友達の見方、小説内の見方、アニメの中での見方など何に由来していてもかまわないのだけど、自分が咀嚼しているのが重要。自分が咀嚼しているならば、周りの環境が急に変わっても、自分の背骨は急には不安定にならない。
私の判断基準の基礎は両親が作った。その基準をベースに、読んだ本、小学校・中学校・高校の素敵なあるいは面白い、個性的な先生達、見たテレビ番組、体験したいろいろなことをミックスして私の背骨はできている。大学での私の指導教員の発言や考え、教えも今や立派
な に私の背骨の一部だ。いまでは、自分が研究を進めるとき指導教員の声が聞こえてくるくらいだ。「それは何の意味があるの？」「それの定義は何？」とか。私の美醜の基準は、明らかにいままで読んだ小説や漫画に由来しているよ。
精神的な背骨がある人は、自分が間違えることをだいたい許容できる。自分の判断基準からしてどうでも良いことならば、間違えたって直してより良いものにしていけば良いだけだから。自分の判断基準からして重要な間違いならば凹むかもしれないけどね。でも、一度背骨を作り上げている人ならば、背骨自体を強化したり、変更したりできるので案外タフだ。
一方、精神的な背骨が無い人は、いかなる間違いも許容できない。なぜならば、判断基準は外にあるためどの間違いが自分に致命的でどの間違いが自分に致命的でないかが判断できないから。だって、判断するのは他人。完璧に振舞いたいのだけど、どう振舞えば完璧かわからなくなり、自信が無くなり、自分が嫌いになる。まるで、プライドを殻にした甲殻類みたいになるんだ。判断基準は外にあるので、自分が取れる選択肢は「 他人に嫌われないようにする 」
「他人にかっこ悪いと思われないようにする 」
「他人にできない奴とみられないようにする」というものしかない。強化も変更もできないんだ。
価値の判断基準が自分の外にある人間は表現者になれない。その表現の仕方が研究だろうと、スピーチだろうと、絵画だろうと、価値の判断基準は常に自分の内部にあり、その基準に基づいて自分の考えや思いを外に問うのが表現だ。価値の判断基準が外にある人間は、自分の内部にあるものが外に問うだけのクオリティに達しているかを常に悩んでしまい表現を外に出せない。外に出せない限り、いかなる人間も表現者とはなりえないんだ。
表現者は、外の世界に自分の考えや思いを問うのがその存在意義だ。外に問うということは反論を食らうということなので、皮膚は破れ、肉は断たれる。でも、骨は守る。傷を癒し、身のこなしを鍛え、骨を強化し、場合によっては骨を入れ替え、再び世の中に自分の考えや思いを問う。考えや思いを外に問わなければ何も始まらないから、ただ、そうする。
だから、君がもし表現者になりたいのだとしたら、精神的な背骨を手に入れる必要がある。それはどんなものでも良い。私が君をどう思うかではなく、君が君をどう思うかそれが重要だ。君は私じゃないし、私は君じゃない。究極的には、私が君をどう思おうが君はそれに左右される筋合いはない。
君が背骨を手に入れる手助けをしきれなかったことに悔いが残るが、この研究室で卒論をやった経験が数年後に役にたつことを祈っている。君が新たな場所で新たな師匠に立派に鍛えてもらえますように。さようなら、お元気で。
Meanwhile , backstage in a room full of reporters , Penn was asked what he would say if had a chance to talk to those protesters .
" I 'd tell them to turn in their hate card and find their better self , you know .
I think that these are largely taught limitations and ignorances , " he explained .
" It 's very sad in a way , because it 's a demonstration of such emotional cowardice to be so afraid to be extending the same rights to a fellow man as you would want for yourself . "
Those protesters he 's referring to were seen by thousands as they passed by Sunset and Highland .
It was a small group from the infamous Kansas - based Westboro Baptist Church , who own hateful web domains like www.godhatesfags.com.
" We 're here to warn you , " a young woman told an LAist Featured Photos contributor on video .
" I 'm picketing the Oscars because the entertainment industry in this country is just one of the pieces , one of the institutions , that you 're using to promote sin and filth and rebellion against the commendants and standards of God . "
" For those who saw the signs of hatred as our cars drove in tonight , I think that it is a good time for those who voted for the ban against gay marriage to sit and reflect and anticipate their great shame and the shame in their grandchildren 's eyes if they continue that way of support , " Sean Penn said in his acceptance speech for actor in a leading role last night at the Oscars .
" We 've got to have equal rights for everyone . "
Backstage at the Oscars with Sean Penn , Questions asked by various media outlets .
Q. Congratulations .
I asked you a couple questions at the SAG Awards .
You were talking about that , actually , you remember Harvey Milk , being old enough to remember him .
Can you talk about , now that you 've won the highest honor in Hollywood for this award , what it means to you to be able to bring his story and how important you feel his story is ?
What Harvey Milk was and what he represented .
A . You know , that means a lot to myself and to everybody involved , not only in the movie , but to anybody who believes in equal rights for human beings , it 's pretty simple .
And , certainly , what I mentioned from the stage earlier tonight , to see this culture of ignorance , and that breeds this kind of hateful expression , that these people have their signs outside essentially telling you that you 're less than human .
There 's nothing more important than the themes of this movie as well as addressing things that are simply , you know , entertaining , I think .
But there 's nothing more important , and so being part of something like that is a privilege .
And when you see something like what you saw outside today , it enhances that .
Q. Hi , Sean . Congratulations .
You certainly deserve the award .
I wanted to ask you , what did you say to those people who were holding those signs tonight , if you happen to go back past Sunset and Highland and see some of those signs and what they 're saying ?
A. I 'd tell them to turn in their hate card and find their better self , you know .
I think that these are largely taught limitations and ignorances , this kind of thing , and it's a really it 's very sad in a way , because it 's a demonstration of such emotional cowardice to be so afraid to be extending the same rights to a fellow man as you would want for yourself .
I would ask them not to tempt those of us who see something more deeply than they are looking at it , as angry as they tend to be in a void .
Q. Tonight , in your acceptance speech , you mentioned President Barack Obama .
I 'm wondering what you would like to see the president do in relation to gay rights .
A . We know his public position as far as the specific issue of gay marriage has not been , let 's say , officially supportive of that .
I would like to believe that that 's a political stand right now and not necessarily a future one or a felt one .
I do n't think that he or that any of us , and in particular our president , will long be able to take that position .
It 's inevitable that this is not because it's not a human luxury ; these are human needs and they will be gotten .
So he 's going to have to he 'll adapt .
Right now I think it 's more focused on , more interested in what we 're going to do to tell him that we will support him in making those kinds of taking those kinds of initiatives .
He 's got people dying right now en masse , and people are desperately poor en masse , and I think those two emergencies need to be taken care of , without him taking too much time about the details of how he approached civil rights .
But the day is going to come and it's going to come quickly .
Q. Could you speak a little bit you spoke very emotionally about your competition this evening with Mickey Rourke .
Could you speak a little bit about your relationship and what you feel about him and sort of the sense of how you guys have grown together ?
A. I 've been making movies for over 25 years and I can't speak for his consistent sense of me .
He 's an excellent bridge burner at times , but we 've had for the most part a very close friendship .
And he 's somebody that I alternatively looked up to and advised and directed , I 've wanted to work with and admired and quite literally had me , almost throughout THE WRESTLER , weeping .
He 's one of our most talented actors , he always was .
I do n't really think of it as comebacks are funny , and we talk about it with him , but everyone in this room has to make a comeback every day .
Life is tough .
And I think what 's sensational about him is always what 's been sensational about him ; he 's one of the great poetic talents in acting that we have .
Q. Australia .
One of the signs of the protesters out there said , " Heath is in hell . "
Can you speak to that ?
A. I do n't know what that means .
Q. I think it references that he 's gone and that the Academy Heath 's in hell .
A. I think if we get used to dismissing these kind of comments rather than commenting on them , we 'll be better off .
It 's meaningless jibberish .
We 've got to focus on people who are clear enough about what they mean .
Q. Sean , congratulations .
A. Hello .
Q. The words " passionate " and " commitment " are words that your friends and everyone around you associate you with .
Do you know where that came from , and do you wish it on your children ?
Is that something that you try to instill in them ?
A . Well , I think we all try to we hope for that in our children , and by whatever means you attempt to instill it in them .
I can't accuse myself of having those qualities , although I appreciate what they said , and I certainly strive for that .
Move over makeup models …. your career is in jeopardy .

We ’re a full - service employer brand and communications agency .
We change the way people think about your company , to attract the right talent , and keep it .
Are you careful with the friends you keep ?
What about those on your Facebook page ?
According to a recent report , your " Friends List " could determine which doors are open and closed to you in the near and distant future .
The report likens the situation to this : say you hung out with some super lefties during your early years -- perhaps even Communist Party members -- and you keep those chums , be they close or distant friends , on your Facebook Friends List .
Several years later you decide to run for office or apply for an executive position at a big corporation ; will those friends come back to haunt you ?
Until Facebook officially changes its controversial terms of use ( TOS ) policy , users do n't actually own anything on the site -- even if they terminate their membership .
Since February 4 , Facebook 's new terms of use policy allows the popular site to share your personal details with third party organizations , even after you 've decided to delete their account .
Thankfully , Facebook and CEO Mark Zuckerberg have decided to revert to the more agreeable terms of service penned prior to Feb.
4 , meaning user details should evaporate when users wish to end their association with the site .
( Source : latimes.com )
However , some critics believe users have already waived the right to privacy by merely opening a Facebook account .
Whether or not to Share Personal Details
Fox News recently pondered this question : " But some may ask -- did n't you already make that decision when you shared your life 's details and photos with your 400 Facebook friends , who then shared your personal news with their 400 Facebook friends , and so on ?
Should n't you expect to lose some control over what happens to your photos ? " ( Source : foxnews.com )
Privacy groups agree that despite the danger , users continue to share too many personal details online .
" You would think that it would be absolutely obvious at this point , given the amount of media and general societal chatter about that fact , but it still amazes me that there 's surprise around this issue , " remarked New York City - based privacy expert Lisa Sotto .
" Clearly these are sites that use data very robustly and store extremely sensitive data , and that should be absolutely obvious to any user . "
It seems many privacy groups have lost faith in Facebook , even after the site 's decision to revert back to a more favorable terms of use policy .
To these media watchdogs , it 's not unlikely that the company will again seek a similar policy , perhaps one not quite so obvious with its privacy violations .
Randy Skoglund , director of Americans for Technology Leadership , believes these companies owe their users more honest policies .
" Facebook , and other online companies , need to be transparent in their business practices and let consumers know exactly what personal information will be retained and what it will be used for , " he said .
Of course , it takes two to tango , and Facebook users may need to be more vigilant than ever before in protecting themselves online .
Reports of an underwater Stonehenge at the bottom of Lake Michigan , including a rock with a Mastodon carved in it have been circulating the internets over the last couple of days .
There has been speculation over the validity of the carving and conspiracy theorists are wondering why this 2007 story has taken so long to receive significant public attention .
But , we here at GeekDad think researchers need to consult their science ( fiction ) texts .
This has H.P. Lovecraft written all over it .
Clearly , the discover is the remains of a now disbanded Deep One temple worshiping Cthulhu , Father Dagon or Mother Hydra .
Of course , any suggestion that this R'lyeh is ridiculous .
It has been well documented that is at some unknown location in the southern oceans ( where they keep finding all those giant squid : Cthulhu spawn , most likely ) .
Those of us who have been teaching our children Lovecraft 's version of pre-history may consider this further justification for our actions .
We all might want to brush up on our Lovecraft reading .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Al Qaeda ’s deputy leader accused Barack Obama of betraying his race and his father ’s Muslim heritage on Wednesday and urged more attacks , as the group tried to counter the incoming U.S. president ’s global popularity .
Osama bin Laden ’s second - in - command Ayman al Zawahri attacked Obama as a “ house Negro , ” a racially - charged term used by 1960s black American Muslim leader Malcolm X to describe black slaves loyal to white masters .
“ You represent the direct opposite of honorable black Americans like ... Malcolm X , ” Zawahri said in an 11 - minute recording publicized on the Internet on Wednesday .
It was al Qaeda ’s first high - level commentary on Obama ’s election on November 4 .
Bin Laden could also release a message on Obama within the next two weeks or so , one analyst said .
Zawahri criticized Obama ’s support for Israel and plans to send more U.S. troops to Afghanistan , where he said they were destined to fail .
He urged Islamist fighters to keep striking a “ criminal ” United States until it withdraws from Muslim lands .
The recording was distributed on a videotape that carried pictures of Obama at the Western Wall in Jerusalem and Malcom X , flanking Zawahri in the center .
U.S. officials and analysts , alert for signs of an attack in the period leading up to the transfer of presidential power on January 20 , said there was no sign of an imminent threat .
They cast Zawahri ’s message as an attempt to shift al Qaeda ’s focus from U.S. President George W. Bush and maintain an enmity against the United States among its supporters .
“ They ’re faced with what is by any accounting a change in this country , ” said one U.S. counterterrorism official who asked not to be identified .
OBAMA BRINGING CHANGE
“ The way they ’re dealing with the change represented by the election of an African American as president of the United States is to insist that nothing has changed , ” he said .
Obama ’s transition office declined to comment .
His election was greeted with broad hope in the Middle East , where U.S. relations with Arabic countries were deeply strained under Bush .
Daniel Benjamin , a counterterrorism official under former President Bill Clinton , said Obama ’s election on a platform of breaking with Bush policies was a boost to American “ soft power , ” or nonmilitary international influence .
Al Qaeda 's second - in - command Ayman al Zawahri 's message criticizing U.S. president - elect Barack Obama and urging attacks on " criminal " America is seen in this video grab released November 19 , 2008 .
REUTERS / SITE Intelligence Group via Reuters TV
“ I think they ( al Qaeda ) are deeply threatened by the fact there is a new American president and that he has come to office saying he wants to have a more constructive relationship with the one billion Muslims in the world . ”
Zawahri , he said , “ feels like he has a competitor for the hearts and minds . ”
Zawahri referred to Obama ’s Kenyan father , who was raised Muslim but became an atheist .
Obama is a Christian .
“ You were born to a Muslim father , but you chose to stand in the ranks of the enemies of the Muslims , ” Zawahri said .
The Malcolm X reference probably reflects the influence of American - born al Qaeda spokesman Adam Gadahn , believed to be close to Zawahri , said a U.S. terrorism monitor who goes by the pseudonym Laura Mansfield .
Zawahri has employed the “ house Negro ” insult before , when in 2007 he used it to label Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and her predecessor , Colin Powell , who are both black .
“ And in you and in Colin Powell , Rice and your likes , the words of Malcolm X ... concerning ‘ House Negroes ’ are confirmed , ” Zawahri said in the message released on Wednesday .
His spoken remarks could also be translated as “ house slaves , ” but al Qaeda ’s accompanying English translation , distributed by the IntelCenter Web monitor , used “ house Negroes . ”
Mansfield said it typically takes bin Laden , deep in hiding , longer than Zawahri to produce a statement reacting to events and relay it to an outlet .
But it would not be a surprise if he released one soon , she said .

The tech community loves to blame the dearth of IPOs on smothering regulation ( SarBox ) and a general " how dare you ask the public for money " attitude on the part of public - market investors .
And those factors no doubt have something to do with it .
But then there 's the matter of crappy companies .
Would you rush out and scramble for shares of the next great tech IPO when the chart of one of 2007 's most ballyhooed ones looks like this ?
Especially when you learn that the company has now postponed its Q4 report because of accounting concerns ?
( That 's TechTarget , by the way .

But the industry 's complaints about how these regulations have killed the golden goose will have more weight when the industry is producing dozens of rapidly growing , high - quality emerging companies every year .

Nokkrar tegundir túnfiska ganga árlega norður og suður eftir hafinu eftir hitastigi sjávar .
Fiskar eru flokkaðir eftir göngumynstri í sjógandandi fiska sem ganga milli sjávar og ferskvatns , fljótagöngufiska sem ganga milli ferskvatnskerfa , t.d. úr á í vatn og öfugt , og ú thafsgöngufiska sem ganga milli búsvæða í sjó .
Sjógangandi fiskar skiptast aftur í vatnagöngufiska sem lifa í sjó en æxlast í fersku vatni , sjógöngufiska sem lifa í ám en æxlast í sjó , og tvíátta fiska sem flytja milli sjávar og ferskvatns einhvern tíma á æviskeiðinu , en ekki til að æxlast , heldur venjulega af líkamlegum ástæðum ( vegna þroskaferils fisksins ) .

A lot of people make their way to this blog using that exact search term , and since there does n't seem to be anything on the Internet devoted to that subject alone , I 'll see what I can do .
Hopefully a lot of people who know more than I do on the subject will add comments to the post afterward to make it even more helpful .
The short answer is : no .
Norwegians can't just up and understand Icelandic .
Icelandic is quite different in structure from the three Scandinavian languages Norwegian , Swedish and Danish , with a case system more like German or Latin , more complex verb conjugation depending on person , it retains the th sound ( both voiced and unvoiced , just like English ) and apparently has a ton of irregularities .
Adding to that , its much smaller population and geographic isolation mean that people outside of the country do n't get to hear it spoken very much either .
That being said , Icelandic is much easier for Norwegians and other Scandinavians to learn than your average English / Spanish / English - and - Spanish / etc. speaker .
Knowing Norwegian and then going on to Icelandic is a bit like knowing French and then going on to Latin in that you 'll find a lot of similarities in vocabulary that make your knowledge of French quite useful , but in having to master a quite different grammar it's not all that much help and you 're still going to have to spend quite a bit of time with that .
It also worth remembering that Nynorsk in general and a number of western Norwegian dialects are closer to Icelandic than Bokmål .
Nynorsk for example writes the word " what " as " kva " instead of " hva " ( h is silent ) in Bokmål , and in Icelandic this is written hvað , but pronounced kvath ( th as inat , notink ) .
Apparently some of the western dialects retain more of a case system as well .
The Icelandic Wikipedia has a few examples of these : ( B = Bokmål , N = Nynorsk , Í = Icelandic ) The closest language to Icelandic is Faroese , but since Faroese is spoken by even less people than Icelandic and does n't have the simpler grammar that the three major Scandinavian languages have , it 's not really a language you 'd want to put any time into unless you were interested in Faroese itself or had family or a house in Tórshavn or some other situation that let you learn it for free or something close to it .
Speaking from personal experience , as a person that can generally make my way through something written in Norwegian without too much trouble , I can definitely understand more written Icelandic than if I had never studied it in the first place , but understanding the whole meaning of the text is beyond me .
Taking a look at this page for example written about fish : fiskar looks like fisker ( fishes ) er looks like er ( is , are ) dyr is the same ( animal ) sem looks like som ( that ) í is i ( in ) og is og ( and ) með is med ( with ) en looks like it might be men ( but ) flestir looks like flere ( many ) So thanks to that I can generally understand that it means something like " Fishes are ( something ) animals that something in water ( probably ) and something with something .
Many fishes are with cold blood , but some ( ? ) something ( fish name ) and ( fish name ) are with hot blood .
Of fishes are found about ( ? )
29,000 kinds ( I assume that 's what that word means ) so / thus there are something something animals .
And that 's being nowhere close to fluent in Norwegian .
It 's a pretty safe bet to say that if you 're interested in Icelandic but find it a bit too challenging at the moment / can't find enough good material to learn the language / are too far away / etc. , learning another Scandinavian language first could be a good idea , just do n't think that you 'll be able to understand Icelandic without putting in some serious time there as well .
One fun thing you can do to get a tiny bit of an idea of what Icelandic looks like to a speaker of a Scandinavian language ( it 's not perfect by any means but still kind of fun to try out ) is to do the following .
First take a text written in Icelandic like this :
We 're going to put this through Google 's translator which is only available for Swedish , Norwegian and Danish ( no Icelandic ) so first we 'll have to remove all the accented characters that do n't exist in those three languages and replaceNow we tell Google that this is Norwegian and see what happens when it turns this " Norwegian " into English : Okay , that 's a bit of a mess near the end but it does illustrate a little bit how Icelandic looks to someone that knows a Scandinavian language in that there 's a lot that is impossible to understand but interspersed with parts that make perfect sense ( " in the sea " for example ) though note that comprehension would still be better than that due to being able to recognize words likeas ( that ) and as ( these ) , which is a kind of linguistic instinct that does n't get picked up by an automatic translator .
Finally , Scandinavians will often tell you that even though their languages are quite similar and there 's a kind of an accepted common Scandinavian tongue , they will often default to English if that turns out to be an easier method , so if you 're a Norwegian speaker in Iceland and do n't know any Icelandic but do know English then you 'll end up using good old rock - steady English instead of trying to get by with a kind of pan-Scandinavian mishmash that might or might not work .
Your Norwegian or Danish or Swedish will definitely help you learn the language in a shorter period of time if you intend to stay in Iceland for the long term , but it 's certainly not a kind of pan-Scandinavian linguistic pass that everyone can understand .
Anything to add or correct to this ?
Please let me know in the comments section below and I 'll update the post accordingly .
Bless bless !
How our liberties have been destroyed
Since Labour was elected 12 years ago , a massive and frightening array of powers have been introduced which curtail Britain 's long - fought - for commitment to the freedom of the individual .
There are 56 such freedom - destroying powers , according to the Convention on Modern Liberty .
They range from the shameful decision to ban inconvenient but peaceful protests in the vicinity of Parliament to the storage by the police of DNA samples taken from entirely innocent people .
The plethora of cameras and databases recording and holding personal information is eroding our civil liberties
Town Hall Stasi routinely deploy anti-terrorist powers to snoop on dog foulers and families suspected of cheating school catchment area rules .
Low - ranking officials have access to the chilling ContactPoint database containing the sensitive personal details of every child in England .
A giant new NHS database will allow confidential patient records to be accessed by health workers across the land .
The list is terrifying .
But still ministers are not satisfied they have sufficient powers to pry into every aspect of our lives .
The Home Office will shortly announce details of a new Big Brother ' Intercept Modernisation Programme ' which will store details of our every phone call and internet visit .
The Coroners and Justice Bill will allow the state to order inquests involving matters of national security to be held in secret if the details could prove embarrassing to ministers .
This means it will be possible to die in modern , ' civilised ' Britain without anyone - not least relatives - knowing how and why .
And , as we reveal today , there will soon be compulsory CCTV cameras tracking people as they shop in supermarkets for a bottle of wine .
Without fanfare , ministers have slipped powers into the Policing and Crime Bill for councils to force any premises selling alcohol to install the cameras and hand over any relevant footage to the police .
But , if passed , it will mean there is virtually no aspect of public life not under surveillance .
Police already have 4.2 million cameras trained on the streets , numberplate recognition systems watching our roads and are even , as we revealed earlier this week , insisting drinkers should be spied upon with CCTV in their local pub .
Save for places of worship , nowhere is sacred or private .
Everyone is a potential suspect .
This Labour Government , in ways that would shock its socialist forebears , is systematically acquiring the tools of a totalitarian state in a way not even Orwell could have predicted .
The price we are paying in the loss of individual freedoms is awesome .
But so is the £ 34 billion cost to the taxpayer of running the likes of ContactPoint and the ID cards database over the next decade , according to the Convention .
Yet are the watchers prepared to be watched themselves , to check they are not abusing the pervasive powers which they have amassed ?
Of course not .
In a display of dizzying hypocrisy , ministers this week introduced a law which makes it a criminal offence , punishable by ten years in prison , to take a picture of a police officer .
The Press will be hampered in reporting legitimate rallies at which police are present .
Peaceful demonstrators will be stopped from taking their own record of events and tourists who dare to take a picture of the Pc guarding Big Ben could quickly find themselves behind bars .
Of course , the Government defends this , and the many other assaults on liberty since 1997 , by pointing to the increased threat Britain faces from serious crime and terrorism .
But with every erosion of the values our enemies so despise , we hand these terrorists a victory to savour .
Enough is enough .
Bushfire Hotline - 1800 240 667
The towns of Kinglake and Marysville have been wiped out and around the state more people have died than in any previous natural catastrophe — one so lethal that authorities are treating it like a major terrorist attack .
The first of several interstate victim identification teams arrived yesterday to assist Victoria Police under a national terrorist contingency plan .
More than 70 people died in the Black Friday fires of 1939 — and 75 on Ash Wednesday in 1983 , 47 of them Victorians .
But as the official death list topped 93 last night , senior police sources told The Age they feared the final figure would be much greater .
MULTIMEDIA : Tales of survival
So many bodies are scattered in fire zones around the state that it could take days to find and retrieve them all .
The names of those killed are only just starting to emerge .
Among them were former Channel Nine newsreader Brian Naylor and his wife Moiree , at Kinglake West .
Victoria 's morgue was full last night — with hospitals and universities being asked to store bodies until formal identifications could be made .
Some of the many injured people in hospital were not expected to survive .
Prime Minister Kevin Rudd yesterday promised help from the army , which has sent bedding to Warragul and heavy equipment to cut fire breaks near Yea .
" Hell and all its fury has visited the good people of Victoria … many good people now lie dead , " Mr Rudd said .
" Many others lie injured . "
Premier John Brumby launched a bushfire appeal fund in partnership with the Federal Government and the Red Cross .
He said the weather conditions that spawned 400 fires across the state were " much worse " than those that produced Ash Wednesday or Black Friday , and he hoped never to see it again .
Schools at Strathewen , Kinglake and Marysville have been destroyed and dozens more will be closed today .
Worst hit was the once - pretty alpine town of Marysville , reduced to a tangled mess of smoking rubble and twisted iron .
Most residents were evacuated to nearby Alexandra — itself under threat from fire last night .
But some of those who left too late or stayed to fight the fire lost their lives .
The fire that began at the old Murrindindi sawmill near Yea earlier on Saturday destroyed the hamlet of Narbethong and then Marysville , house by house , street by street .
In an hour , Marysville was no more .
Every public building including the police station , post office , telephone exchange and much - loved guest houses and a hotel , had been destroyed .
Worse was that some of the gutted cars and buildings had bodies in them .
The few locals who stayed and survived talked numbly yesterday of one firefighter 's family being killed , of a pensioner dying at home and of several cars with human remains in them .
Local builder Leigh Jowett saved the old house in which he had grown up — then helped his neighbours save theirs .
" There might only be 15 or 20 houses left in Marysville , " Mr Jowett said .
" There 's only three left in Falls Road — and the whole main street is gone apart from one motel . "
Former Marysville resident Graham Haycraft was distressed to hear his old family home had been destroyed but counts himself lucky to have moved out .
" Marysville missed out in 1939 and on Ash Wednesday , but not this time , " he said last night .
" My heart goes out to people who are part of my life . "
He expects to return for funerals .
There were similar scenes and stories at Kinglake , at Churchill in West Gippsland and at Bendigo .
Stories of offhand heroism emerged yesterday .
Reluctant teenage hero Rhys Sund declined to be photographed after driving a tiny tractor and trailer across country behind the fire front at Chum Creek , near Healesville , to save his sister Rhiannon and a group of frightened women and children from an isolated farmhouse .
" I 'm so proud of the young bloke , " Rhys 's father Mark Sund said yesterday .
" He cut down the fences in his way and went in .
" Rhys has n't been to bed yet .
He 's been fighting the fire all night . "
Channel Seven reporter Norm Beaman last night was celebrating his wife Annie 's escape from the Kilmore East fire while he was stopped at a police road block several kilometres from their isolated Mount Disappointment property .
Beaman praised the bravery of a local policeman , Peter Gough , who drove a police sedan through burning bush to the farm while Beaman was forced to stay at the roadblock after returning from Melbourne to tackle the fire .
" Annie put up an incredible fight by herself , " he said .
" She wet down the house and garden with fire pumps then when the shearing shed and machinery shed exploded she left .
She told me on the mobile that she was going to jump in the dam , but she changed her mind and drove to a burnt - out paddock with the neighbours , where they wrapped themselves in wet blankets .
That 's where Peter Gough found her .
He 's a very brave cop . "
Although the worst might be over , the danger is not past .
The Bureau of Meteorology has predicted dangerous conditions for much of the week , warning of further lightning strikes and strong winds .
Fire danger would still be " very high " from midday to 6 pm on most days .
Last night the 30,000 - hectare Beechworth fire was causing concern and none of the major fires burning across the state had been contained .
A containment line was still being built around Alexandra to protect it from the fire .
Loading
The Kinglake fires were hitting around Glenburn , with concerns for homes along Melba Highway and Yea River Valley , towards Murrindindi .
The Churchill blaze covers up to 33,000 hectares , the Bunyip fire about 25,000 hectares .
And a 15,000 - hectare fire has started in national park near Dargo .
Bestselling author Stephen King added his imprimatur to Amazon 's latest attempt to break open the electronic book market today with the unveiling of a new version of its Kindle reader in New York .
The new gadget – which is due to go on sale in America at the end of February – is the second version of the Kindle , boasting longer battery life over its predecessor , as well as a storage capacity that has been extended from 185 MB to 2GB .
The cost will stay the same , at $ 359 ( £ 240 ) , but the main change is in the product 's design – the new Kindle sports a sleek new look that is intended to appeal more to the general public rather than the previous blocky version did .
The announcement , which was widely expected , came at an event in New York hosted by Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos .
He said that the Kindle had helped revolutionised the electronic book market since launching in 2007 .
" We 've been selling e-books for years , and guess what ? " he asked .
" It did n't work - until 14 months ago . "
King , who has published more than 40 novels since 1974 , read an excerpt from his new novella , Ur – which is being released exclusively for the Kindle .
Although Amazon has not revealed how many Kindles it has sold since launching the first version in November 2007 , it has struggled to keep up with demand .
Citigroup analyst Mark Mahaney estimated recently that Kindle sales for 2008 could be as high as 500,000 units , putting it on a par with the early days of Apple 's iPod music player and potentially creating a market worth $ 1bn in sales by 2010 .
There is no sign that the device will be available in the UK , however .
Although the device itself works outside of the US , the Kindle 's Whispernet service – which piggybacks on mobile phone networks and allows it to be updated over the air – is not compatible with European telecoms systems .
Amazon has failed to reach an agreement with the continent 's plethora of mobile phone companies , and has yet to announce availability outside the US .
The widely - leaked announcements also left industry observers unimpressed .
Jeffrey Lindsay , an analyst with Bernstein Research , said that was still too expensive for mainstream consumers .
" Really we do n't see them as having taken the device to the next level , " he told Reuters .
" We think it 's an incremental step of improvements .
They 're advancing very conservatively . "

Just give me credit for my work , and , keep in context .
Since the media has decided to scare everyone with predictions of chemical , biological , or nuclear warfare on our turf I decided to write a paper and keep things in their proper perspective .
I am a retired military weapons , munitions , and training expert .
Lesson number one :
In the mid 1990s there were a series of nerve gas attacks on crowded Japanese subway stations .
Given perfect conditions for an attack less than 10 % of the people there were injured ( the injured were better in a few hours ) and only one percent of the injured died .
60 Minutes once had a fellow telling us that one drop of nerve gas could kill a thousand people , well he did n’t tell you the thousand dead people per drop was theoretical .
Drill Sergeants exaggerate how terrible this stuff was to keep the recruits awake in class ( I know this because I was a Drill Sergeant too ) .
Forget everything you ’ve ever seen on TV , in the movies , or read in a novel about this stuff , it was all a lie ( read this sentence again out loud ! ) .
These weapons are about terror , if you remain calm , you will probably not die .
This is far less scary than the media and their “ Experts , ” make it sound .
Chemical Weapons
Chemical weapons are categorized as nerve , blood , blister , and Incapacitating agents .
Contrary to the hype of reporters and politicians they are not weapons of mass destruction they are “ area denial , ” and terror weapons that do n’t destroy anything .
When you leave the area you almost always leave the risk .
That ’s the difference ; you can leave the area and the risk but soldiers may have to stay put and sit through it and that ’s why they need all that spiffy gear .
These are not gasses , they are vapors and / or air borne particles .
The agent must be delivered in sufficient quantity to kill / injure , and that defines when / how it ’s used .
Every day we have a morning and evening inversion where “ stuff , ” suspended in the air gets pushed down .
This inversion is why allergies ( pollen ) and air pollution are worst at these times of the day .
So , a chemical attack will have it ’s best effect an hour or so either side of sunrise / sunset .
Also , being vapors and airborne particles they are heavier than air so they will seek low places like ditches , basements and underground garages .
This stuff wo n’t work when it ’s freezing , it does n’t last when it ’s hot , and wind spreads it too thin too fast .
They ’ve got to get this stuff on you , or , get you to inhale it for it to work .
They also have to get the concentration of chemicals high enough to kill or wound you .
Too little and it ’s nothing , too much and it ’s wasted .
What I hope you ’ve gathered by this point is that a chemical weapons attack that kills a lot of people is incredibly hard to do with military grade agents and equipment so you can imagine how hard it will be for terrorists .
The more you know about this stuff the more you realize how hard it is to use .
We ’ll start by talking about nerve agents .
You have these in your house , plain old bug killer ( like Raid ) is nerve agent .
All nerve agents work the same way ; they are cholinesterase inhibitors that mess up the signals your nervous system uses to make your body function .
It can harm you if you get it on your skin but it works best if they can get you to inhale it .
If you do n’t die in the first minute and you can leave the area you ’re probably gonna live .
The military ’s antidote for all nerve agents is atropine and pralidoxime chloride .
Neither one of these does anything to cure the nerve agent , they send your body into overdrive to keep you alive for five minutes ,
after that the agent is used up .
Your best protection is fresh air and staying calm .
Listed below are the symptoms for nerve agent poisoning :
Sudden headache , Dimness of vision ( someone you ’re looking at will have pinpointed pupils ) , runny nose , excessive saliva or drooling , difficulty breathing , tightness in chest , nausea , stomach cramps , twitching of exposed skin where a liquid just got on you .
If you are in public and you start experiencing these symptoms , first ask yourself , did anything out of the ordinary just happen , a loud pop , did someone spray something on the crowd ?
Are other people getting sick too ?
Is there an odor of new mown hay , green corn , something fruity , or camphor where it should n’t be ?
If the answer is yes , then calmly ( if you panic you breathe faster and inhale more air / poison ) leave the area and head up wind , or , outside .
Fresh air is the best “ right now antidote . ”
If you have a blob of liquid that looks like molasses or Kayro syrup on you ; blot it or scrape it off and away from yourself with anything disposable .
This stuff works based on your body weight , what a crop duster uses to kill bugs wo n’t hurt you unless you stand there and breathe it in real deep , then lick the residue off the ground for a while .
Remember they have to do all the work , they have to get the concentration up and keep it up for several minutes while all you have to do is quit getting it on you / quit breathing it by putting space between you and the attack .
Blood agents are cyanide or arsine which affect your blood ’s ability to provide oxygen to your tissue .
The scenario for attack would be the same as nerve agent .
Look for a pop or someone splashing / spraying something and folks around there getting woozy / falling down .
The telltale smells are bitter almonds or garlic where it should n’t be .
The symptoms are blue lips , blue under the fingernails rapid breathing .
The military ’s antidote is amyl nitride and just like nerve agent antidote it just keeps your body working for five minutes till the toxins are used up .
Fresh air is the your best individual chance .
Blister agents ( distilled mustard ) are so nasty that nobody wants to even handle it let alone use it .
It ’s almost impossible to handle safely and may have delayed effect of up to 12 hours .
The attack scenario is also limited to the things you ’d see from other chemicals .
If you do get large , painful blisters for no apparent reason , do n’t pop them , if you must , do n’t let the liquid from the blister get on any other area , the stuff just keeps on spreading .
It ’s just as likely to harm the user as the target .
Soap , water , sunshine , and fresh air are this stuff ’s enemy .
Bottom line on chemical weapons ( it ’s the same if they use industrial chemical spills ) ; they are intended to make you panic , to terrorize you , to herd you like sheep to the wolves .
If there is an attack , leave the area and go upwind , or to the sides of the wind stream .
They have to get the stuff to you , and on you .
You ’re more likely to be hurt by a drunk driver on any given day than be hurt by one of these attacks .
Your odds get better if you leave the area .
Soap , water , time , and fresh air really deal this stuff a knock - out - punch .
Do n’t let fear of an isolated attack rule your life .
The odds are really on your side .
Nuclear Weapons
Nuclear bombs .
These are the only weapons of mass destruction on earth .
The effects of a nuclear bomb are heat , blast , EMP , and radiation .
If you see a bright flash of light like the sun , where the sun is n’t , fall to the ground !
The heat will be over a second .
Then there will be two blast waves , one out going , and one on it ’s way back .
Do n’t stand up to see what happened after the first wave ; anything that ’s going to happen will have happened in two full minutes .
These will be low yield devices and will not level whole cities .
If you live through the heat , blast , and initial burst of radiation , you ’ll probably live for a very , very long time .
Radiation will not create fifty foot tall women , or giant ants and grass hoppers the size of tanks .
These will be at the most 1 kiloton bombs ; that ’s the equivalent of 1,000 tons of TNT .
Here ’s the real deal , flying debris and radiation will kill a lot of exposed ( not all ! ) people within a half mile of the blast .
Under perfect conditions this is about a half mile circle of death and destruction , but , when it ’s done it ’s done .
EMP stands for Electro Magnetic Pulse and it will fry every electronic device for a good distance , it ’s impossible to say what and how far but probably not over a couple of miles from ground zero is a good guess .
Cars , cell phones , computers , ATMs , you name it , all will be out of order .
There are lots of kinds of radiation , you only need to worry about three , the others you have lived with for years .
You need to worry about “ Ionizing radiation , ” these are little sub atomic particles that go whizzing along at the speed of light .
They hit individual cells in your body , kill the nucleus and keep on going .
That ’s how you get radiation poisoning , you have so many dead cells in your body that the decaying cells poison you .
It ’s the same as people getting radiation treatments for cancer , only a bigger area gets radiated .
The good news is you do n’t have to just sit there and take it , and there ’s lots you can do rather than panic .
First ; your skin will stop alpha particles , a page of a news paper or your clothing will stop beta particles , you just gotta try and avoid inhaling dust that ’s contaminated with atoms that are emitting these things and you ’ll be generally safe from them .
Gamma rays are particles that travel like rays ( quantum physics makes my brain hurt ) and they create the same damage as alpha and beta particles only they keep going and kill lots of cells as they go all the way through your body .
It takes a lot to stop these things , lots of dense material , on the other hand it takes a lot of this to kill you .
Your defense is as always to not panic .
Basic hygiene and normal preparation are your friends .
All canned or frozen food is safe to eat .
The radiation poisoning will not effect plants so fruits and vegetables are OK if there ’s no dust on em ( rinse em off if there is ) .
If you do n’t have running water and you need to collect rain water or use water from wherever , just let it sit for thirty minutes and skim off the water gently from the top .
The dust with the bad stuff in it will settle and the remaining water can be used for the toilet which will still work if you have a bucket of water to pour in the
tank .
Biological Weapons
Finally there ’s biological warfare .
There ’s not much to cover here .
Basic personal hygiene and sanitation will take you further than a million doctors .
Wash your hands often , do n’t share drinks , food , sloppy kisses , etc. , …. with strangers .
Keep your garbage can with a tight lid on it , do n’t have standing water ( like old buckets , ditches , or kiddie pools ) laying around to allow mosquitoes breeding room .
This stuff is carried by vectors , that is bugs , rodents , and contaminated material .
If biological warfare is so easy as the TV makes it sound , why has Saddam Hussein spent twenty years , millions , and millions of dollars trying to get it right ?
If you ’re clean of person and home you eat well and are active you ’re gonna live .
Overall preparation for any terrorist attack is the same as you ’d take for a big storm .
If you want a gas mask , fine , go get one .
I know this stuff and I ’m not getting one and I told my Mom not to bother with one either ( how ’s that for confidence ) .
We have a week ’s worth of cash , several days worth of canned goods and plenty of soap and water .
We do n’t leave stuff out to attract bugs or rodents so we do n’t have them .
These people can’t conceive a nation this big with this much resources .
These weapons are made to cause panic , terror , and to demoralize .
If we do n’t run around like sheep they wo n’t use this stuff after they find out it ’s no fun .
The government is going nuts over this stuff because they have to protect every inch of America .
You ’ve only gotta protect yourself , and by doing that , you help the country .
Finally , there are millions of caveats to everything I wrote here and you can think up specific scenarios where my advice is n’t the best .
This letter is supposed to help the greatest number of people under the greatest number of situations .
If you do n’t like my work , do n’t nit pick , just sit down and explain chemical , nuclear , and biological warfare in a document around three pages long yourself .
This is how we the people of the United States can rob these people of their most desired goal , your terror .

For more of Cinema Blend 's BEST OF 2008 click HERE .
We all know that the technology and machinery that makes movies great is n't always behind the scenes .
While it might be a series of computers and controlled stunt toys that make movies look great , the gadgets and gizmos that show up onscreen are the ones that really inspire us .
And 2008 gave us more than enough to appreciate .
After all , one of the biggest stars of the year was a little trash compactor robot , andbiggest star has gadgets even the Pentagon would envy .
Below is our list of the 10 best robots , gadgets and machines of 2008 , from Wall - E to A.R.I.A , the Batpod to time machines .
It 's been a good year for machinery , maybe even better than it 's been for actors .
Behold our mechanical masters .
This is no contest .
While Eve is sleek and beautiful , Wall - E had more character and soul than most human actors onscreen this year ..
" Sit down there , make yourself comfortable , put your feet in the stirrups , and ...
It 's something , is n't it ?
Hundred bucks , all in - not counting my labor , and the ... cost of the dildo .
" It 's way , way more than just the Batmobile on two wheels .
It 's a feat of engineering no one but the new Batman could pull off , not to mention look good riding .
With nothing resembling faces , arms or voices , the robots that helped him build the Iron Man suit stole the show during those early test runs .
And stealing any attention from Robert Downey Jr. this year is no easy trick ..
The sweded movies ofwere all fantastic , but there was special genius in the way Jack Black recreated Robocop out of some used car parts .
His Ghostbuster costume gets an honorable mention ..
Who knows if it 's robot technology or straight - up magic that keeps the ectoplasmic Krauss humming inside that old diving bell , but whatever it is , it 's awesome .
The hilarious Teutonic voice fromcreator Seth MacFarlane is a bonus ..
OK , we all should have figured the mysterious woman would be a computer , given that it 's a Spielberg idea , but the A.R.I.A. supercomputer at least looked really cool , even if the logic was n't there at all ..
Does it tell the truth ?
Is it manipulated by the evil Morgan Freeman ?
Who cares !
For the first time in movie history , is at the heart of a summer blockbuster .
The movie was just a bunch of wasted narrative opportunities , but the mechanical , steam - powered city at its center , entirely underground and lit by spooky amber lights , was marvelous , from the Wes Anderson - esque fonts to the answering machine that was operated by foot pedals .
High - tech wonders were n't really what madegreat -- well , not great , but pretty entertaining , But the time machine that Jesus uses to travel back in time , for reasons we never really understand , would make any high school theater department weep with envy .
People have been speaking a lot about the memory of technology recently - much of it stemming from the recent comments by Lynne Brindley , the head of the British Library , who said that we need to work harder to preserve our digital memories .
Although , scandalously , there was no mention of the Internet Archive in there , Brindley hit on a truth - our lives are better recorded than ever , but all that information is more easily lost because we track it in files and formats that we may no longer be able to understand in just a couple of years .
So the question remains : how do we make sure we can recover our digital lives at an unspecified point in the future ?
Yeah , you could translate it from one format to another or assiduously keep everything backwards - compatible .
But some researchers in Portsmouth thing they 've come up with a better answer - an emulator to end all emulators .
Nearly € 1 m has been given to the faculty of Creative and Cultural Industries researchers to help create software that can look back in time and capture the workings of old computers , files , software and technologies .
They also hope to be able to future - proof the software so every single piece of data and software created can be encoded to be read by newer , faster , better computers in the future .
This Rosetta Stone for the digital world , they say , could help people recover files from floppy disks , old computers and archaic machines ( and the internet too , I suppose ) forevermore .
Rather than running a single emulator , they hope to code a single contraption that can translate whatever it finds into something your computer can understand .
It 's part of a € 4 m EU project which wants to help preserve modern life for future generations : a sort of digi-cultural archaeology that is likely to get more important as the years go by .
I 'd like to think this is the silver bullet for our memories , but it 's also a Sisyphean task - the never - ending attempt to emulate everything for everyone ( and , of course , retain working machines that can read those old floppies , too ) .
All I know is that things were a lot simpler when all we did was scratch pictures on the walls of caves .
Women Orgasm More For Wealthy Men
A British researcher finds that women come more often in the arms of wealthy men .
 Womens orgasm frequency increases with the income of their partner ,  said Dr Thomas Pollet , the Newcastle University psychologist behind the research .
He believes the phenomenon is an evolutionary adaptation that is hard - wired into women , driving them to select men on the basis of their perceived quality .
The study is certain to prove controversial , suggesting that women are inherently programmed to be gold - diggers .
Women are turned on by wealthy men .
It really is true .
But the idea that stereotypes are true of course is evil crimethink .
We are encouraged to respond to such thoughts by engaging in what Orwell called CrimeStop .
But the mental technique of CrimeStop is protective stupidity .
I do not feel more safe as a result of the promotion of this mental technique .
The desire of women for a wealthy man seems an obvious product of evolution .
That people behave in ways that are a product of our evolutionary history seems obvious to me .
Of course ignorant people come up with all sorts of alternative explanations for why we behave as well do .
Cassie is unrepentant about dating rich men .
 Of course it is much better to sleep with men with lots of money ,  said the 27 - year - old lawyer from London .
 Any girl who tells you different is lying .
Rich men are powerful and successful and confident and charismatic .
They know what they want , and they go out and get it .
That translates to being fantastic in bed . 
Women do pick up on the confidence of a successful alpha male and most are attracted to it .
So pick - up artists like Roissy advocate a strategy of adopting alpha male behaviors as pick - up techniques .
While some ( though not all ) of his female readers object to the efficacy of these techniques I think he 's right overall .
But if you can create wealth then you 'll do even better .
Alpha behavior techniques plus wealth work better than just wealth or just the techniques .
So it still helps to get rich .
We are the products of our evolutionary history Denying this does not change us .
The denial just leads us into rationalizations to explain why we engage in behaviors that are evolutionary strategies .

Flying may be the safest form of transport , but many of the three million people who take to the air each day are terrified of crashing .
Now more than ever , though , it 's possible to survive a plane crash .
Most people believe that if they 're in a plane crash their time is up .
In fact the truth is surprisingly different .
In the US alone , between 1983 and 2000 , there were 568 plane crashes .
Out of the collective 53,487 people onboard , 51,207 survived .
The advances in science and technology now mean over 90 % of plane crashes have survivors .
And there are many things you might consider to increase your chances of surviving such as : • how to survive the moment of impact
• the life and death decisions you should make during the evacuation
• what to do if there is a fire onboard
• how to survive if your plane ditches into water
• statistically where you should sit to increase your chances of surviving .
World leading aviation safety expert Professor Ed Galea , of the University of Greenwich , has studied over 2,000 survivor reports and compiled a unique database .
The important thing is to get your upper torso down as much as possible
Tom Barth " Surviving an aircraft crash is not a matter of fate .
You can help yourself getting out of an aircraft quickly , and so there are things you can do to improve your chances of surviving , " says Professor Galea .
He has discovered what all these survivors were doing that got them off the plane alive and his findings are extraordinary .
Time and time again many of the passengers struggled to undo their seatbelts .
" People tend to try and press a button on the seatbelt because in this emergency situation , they revert to normal behaviour .
And what 's normal behaviour for most people ?
Well , they experience a seatbelt in their car and in their car , it 's a push - button system .
" This seat belt is different to what 's in your car ; it 's a latch that you 've got to pull . "
If your plane is about to crash , you may be told to adopt the brace position - an important step , says Tom Barth from AmSafe Aviation , an expert in how to survive an impact .
" The brace position is a position that will offer you the best chance to survive in a crash because it stops you from flying forward and striking the seat or interior in front of you , " says Mr Barth .
" The important thing is to get your upper torso down as much as possible , limiting the ' jackknife ' effect from impact forces . "
His team in Phoenix , Arizona , has developed the first airbag ever to be put onboard commercial aviation seats .
It 's a technology that has saved thousands of lives every year in the car industry and he 's hoping it will do the same in the aviation world .
It makes the seat safer and complements other safety technologies such as the fire resistant interior , to ensure that you stay conscious and are able to evacuate the wreckage .
Look around you and see where your nearest cabin crew are - they 'll tell you what to do
Helen Muir
" The airbag is folded up in the seatbelt itself and deploys away from the occupant , making it safe for children and adults .
The airbags inflate very rapidly in about 30 milliseconds , which is much faster than you can blink your eye . "
Many plane crashes have a post - crash fire but it's not the flames that are likely to kill you , it 's the toxic smoke .
Smoke onboard is lethal ; in just a few breaths you can pass out .
And if you had to evacuate in smoke , finding your exit is very difficult .
But there is one simple step you can take which could increase your chances of getting off in the presence of smoke , says Professor Galea .
" I count the seat rows from my seating position to the exit .
So in the event of smoke or if emergency lighting fails and it's very dark , I know the number of seat rows and I can feel my way to an exit .
By counting the seat backs I 'll know when I 've reached the exit row . "
Professor Helen Muir , of Cranfield University , who studies the behaviour of passengers during evacuations , believes how you behave in those last few minutes can make the difference between life and death .
She has her own " one simple step " suggestion .
" If you want to survive an aircraft accident , even though they 're very infrequent , every time you get on an aeroplane you want to sit down and then make a plan , " she says .
" In other words , look around you and see where your nearest cabin crew are , because they 're the people who will tell you what to do and will make a huge difference .
Then look where your nearest exits are , both in front , behind and across , and work out how you would get there . "
But what about the one question that everyone wants to know - the Holy Grail in aviation safety is where to sit on a plane to increase your chances of staying alive ?
CRASH SURVIVOR
I felt like I was on a rollercoaster or something
Mercedes Johnson Mercedes Johnson survived the American Airlines Flight 965 which crashed into a Colombian mountain in 1995 .
Out of 159 onboard , only four lived and Ms Johnson believes where she sat played a role in her survival .
" The location where we were sitting was over the wing which was near the exit row and I 've heard on numerous occasions that those rows are one of the safest areas to sit in because it's the most reinforced with metal , " says Ms Johnson .
But sitting over the wings is n't always the best place , because you do n't know how your plane is going to crash .
" I 'm often asked , ' well , where should I sit in an aircraft to have the best chance of surviving ? ' " says Ms Muir , " and , sadly , I have n't got a good answer . "
" They 're unpredictable events , so you never know whether it 's going to be a crash landing or whether you 're going to have a fire in one of the engines .
And this means you can't say where 's the best place to sit . "

The brace position is all very well , but has anyone , including all these researchers , actually tried to do it on a plane ?
With a typical seating pitch of 31 " ( much less on budget airline and chartered flights ) getting you back down horizontal , as shown in the picture above , is virtually impossible for most 6 foot tall people who make up a sizeable amount of the population .
Dan Robinson , Liverpool , UK Due to a ' close call ' a few years ago I am now terrified of flying .
I am due to go to New York in December and I have been dreading it but I feel a little more relaxed after reading this report as I know there are things I can do incase of emergency .
M , Cambridge I 'm flying to Australia in a few weeks .
Such information is just what I need .
Thanks again to the Beeb for providing us with the little facts that make all the difference .
Prysor Williams , Pandy Tudur , N. Wales
If smoke is such a big killer , then why not have smoke hoods stored with Lifejackets under every seat .
They would cost next to nothing , weigh virtually zero and take up almost no space when folded , but perhaps save more lives than lifejackets ever did , giving that few minutes needed to get through the smoke and out of the exit .
Dave , Tonbridge , UK
Of the stats quoted , I expect the majority of survivors are from small , light aircraft .
Indeed , what is an aircraft defined as for the purposes of these statistics ?
The fact remains that when heavy passenger airliners slam into the ground , the impact forces and resultant debris / shrapnel will kill you and you will not be able to hold a brace position .
It is nonsense to suggest otherwise .
the safest place to sit ?
At home of course !
Could Milla Harrison please mention some good examples of when a plane has crashed into the sea , and has avoided violently breaking up .
If there were some good stories of people surviving jet crashes into the sea , then correct lifejacket technique might become of interest .
With the exception of planes running off the end of a runway into the sea , I was under the impression that the sea does n't make a good landing zone .
Andrew Other , Manchester Surely one of the easiest ways to reduce death and injury from the initial collision would be for the seats to face backwards .
Then , instead of having to adopt an unnatural brace position , the seat would provide the necessary support .
kevin mcilroy , harrow Professor Galea says that it is NOT a matter of fate surviving a crash , but that there are things that you can do to improve your chances .
However , it could still be fate that those people survive .
It was fate that they sat where they did and took the action they did .
Therefore it was fate that they survived !
Matt Jones , Northallerton
This article actually makes very little sense .
The seatbelt bit ?
What , so the survivors often had difficulty undoing their seatbelts ?
And ?
How was this helpful to surviving ?
All this article does is reitterate the safety talk at the begining of each flight - and we all know that !
Glyn Williams , London I saw a test on TV and if people knew the number of rows to the exit and had made a plan , they emptied the airplane quicker and 45 % more people would survive .
So now I always do that count and plan , and also read how to open the doors .
Fiona Macartney , Rugby , UK
There is a factual error in this report , air travel is not necessarily the safest form of transport .
It all depends how it is measured , in fact rail travel wins on safety in terms of accidents per journeys and accidents per hours travelled .
Air travel only edges it on accidents per mile travelled .
Andrew Kelly , Bath I 've always assumed that the best place to sit to have a best chance of survival is somewhere near the back next to the aisle , the premise being is that the rest of the plane acts as a huge crumple zone .
This assumes that the plane does n't stall or drops tail - first out of the sky .
Dave Mills , Nottingham
Before every flight the cabin crew give a safety briefing on all this important stuff .
Next time you fly look around the cabin when this is happening .
I 'll guarantee at least 50 - 75 % are not listening and watching .
These are the people who are going to be between you and a safe exit if it all goes wrong ...
Reassuring thought isnt it ?
Bob Ward , Great Yarmouth UK
I used to fly 15 or more times a year over a period of 10 years and can agree with all the advice above .
Awareness of exits and your own location , wear the seatbelt at all times and always put your shoes back on well before landing , not after the plane has stopped !
The other unwritten rule of any disaster is that you have to know that you are going to survive , never ever give up !
simon mallett , UK Maidstone I 've just recently had to travel quite frequently by air for business , having previously only flown for the occasional foreign holiday .
I 'm amazed at how few other people actually listen to the on - board emergency briefing given by the flight crew prior to take - off .
Perhaps the survivors of plane crashes are the one 's that DO listen !
Max Harris , Crawley , UK
Why are you asking the survivor how her seat choice helped her ?
She is n't an engineer .
She has no special insight .
Ask an expert .
Lindsay , Glasgow I can't help thinking that this story is rather misleading .
Are n't most of the events you call " crashes " in fact " crash - landings " , or even just " emergency landings " ?
Also , I have never heard of a large aircraft coming down on water and not breaking into pieces ( seaplanes excluded ) .
Having said that , flying is still the safest way to travel , and I 'm not afraid of flying - but if a plane I was on crashed , I would NOT expect to survive .
Gordon Morrison , Basingstoke , UK I think that one of the simplest things to do to improve your chances is to listen to the safety announcement .
I get quite annoyed at the businessmen who have done this flying thing so many times that they think they do n't have to listen .
My safety will also depend on them doing the right thing if the time comes .
John Powers , Kettering Northants
Some very good advice but the alternative brace position simply would not be possible for many people in economy class as the seat pitch is too short .
My knees are usually touching the seat in front so there is no way I could put my head down to my knees .
Dave , Horsham , UK
It 's good to know this , however one question - how on earth are you supposed to adopt the braced position over your knees ( position 1 in the picture ) when most airlines in economy class dont give you the room ( as most of the chairs are so close together you are alomost sitting on the person behind 's legs ) ??
Emma Lipman , Bahrain
How many airlines have you travelled on that give you anough leg room to adopt the " protective brace " position ?
Peter Smithj , Surbiton , UK Depends on the magnitude of the crash - Of the 568 crashes how many were very trivial ?
Of the sort of crashes that people really worry about i.e. flying into a mountain or exploding mid air at 30,000 feet I do n't think an airbag is really going to help !
james , Doncaster I do n't see why they have n't invented some sort of system which envelopes the whole seat and protects you from fire , smoke and impact .
You almost end up in some kind of baloon type contraption , with air inside , which would also float if the crash happened at sea .
Tony Brannon , Alvechurch , UK Let 's not have unreasonable survival expectations .
The Economist recently reported that , in the history of aviation , there has been no case of passengers surviving the crash - landing of a wide - bodied aircraft on water .
Skip the life - belt drill .
John Heath , Edinburgh
Air travel is indeed the safest per mile travelled , but is not the safest per journey .
That safety title goes to rail travel .
Dominic , London I always have a wry smile when the flight attendents point out the " whistle and light " on the life jacket " for attracting attention " .
I just assumed the flaming wreckage of the crashed aircraft would be sufficient !
C Simmons , Belfast
As a retired Firefighter , when myself and wife fly anywhere I always ask to be seated at the main entrance / emergency exit doors , generally one has to be physically fit to be afforded these seats , as in the event of an accident / emergency you can assist Cabin Crew to open door or doors .
I also tell Flight Attendants that I am a retired Firefighter , this usually goes down well .
My main suggestion would be that in the event of an accident / emergency where fire and smoke ingresses into the cabin , I would keep as low as possible to the cabin floor as there is always air close to the floor , making my way to exit with my wife behind me , but in constant contact by touch , this should ensure as safe a passage to exiting the Aircraft as is possible under such extreme conditions .
If at all possible , panic should be avoided and controlled at the onset of it happening .
Allan L. Mair. , Cumbrenauld , Glasgow , Scotland .
I heard that the brace position is requested as the crash position on a plane becauase it 's the most efficient way to break your neck and therefore make your death instant .
Maybe an expert would like to comment ?
Lee Pike , Cardiff , UK
This sounds bizarre , but I feel it merits some consideration .
I have always thought that the roofs of aircraft should be fitted with a series of massive parachutes .
These would be deployed , manually or automatically , in an apppropriate emergency to bring the aircraft down safely .
C. Matthews , birmingham , uk The image : ALTERNATIVE BRACE POSITIONS made me laugh .
When was the last you sat on a plane and there was that kind of leg room .
Most people , myself included have to enjure plane journeys with their knees wedge tight up against the seat infront .
shaun , brighton
Some experts feel that it is safer to be seated backwards , facing the tail , if a crash occurs , because your body supposedly takes the impact in a less harmful way .
Travellers supposedly like to ride facing forwards , but I would definitely trade a view for greater safety .
I always ride the train facing backwards for the same reason .
DeeDee Doke , Ely , UK
Do n't military transporter jets that carry soldiers have seats back to front , which is supposed to be better for survival in an event of a crash .
I have read that commercial airlines do n't do this because passengers like to sit going forwards .
They also so that the back of the plane is generally safer and that is where the black box is usually located .
JT , Tunbridge Wells , Kent
When black box flight recorders were invented it was hailed as the beginning of the end for plane crashes .
With the information gathered from the boxes of downed aircraft , it was said that eventually we 'd understand all potential problems , and that in turn would eventually stop crashes .
There 's hundreds of points on an aircraft that can be monitored , but only a few crucial pieces of info are , such as air speed , height , etc .
If that technology had been exploited when it was invented , we could have put a serious boot into the chances of dying in a plane crash .
Military planes rarely crash , because they are constantly linked through satellites to ground control , where someone can monitor every point on the plane , alerting the pilot to potential dangers .
If this ( expensive ) system was installed with commercial jets , maybe I would n't be too scared to fly ...
Alan McAllister , Glasgow , Scotland
As a crew member of 35 years the first thing a passenger could do to help themselves would be to watch and listen to the safty demonstration .
So many people think it is clever to read the paper and be seen not to watch .
With the newer seats in First and Club class cabins the Life jacket is not always UNDER THE SEAT and the positon of the seat required in an emergency is NOT always upright .
R Sayle , Hampton
I 've heard that wearing cotton clothing as opposed to anything made of non-natural fibers is better in cases of fire onboard a plane , or anywhere for that matter .
The fabric will not cling to your body if it catches fire , increasing the magnitude of the burn (s ) received and chances of getting third - degree burns .
I always wear cotton clothing when flying just in case .

Reading The Ferengi Programmer by Jeff Atwood really made me quite concerned .
Here 's clearly an opinion which to me seems not grounded in sustained experience in applying the principles and is likely poor message going out to junior programmers .
In the post the author treats SOLID principles by Bob Martin as a ruleset that programmers apply from time to time .
Once you get yourself into that frame of mind it is difficult to then contest the rest of the post .
I would want to re-present the same topic with a different frame of mind .
SOLID principles are principles that you learn in your early days as a designer .
These are formative stages when you are honing your skills and attempting to review your designs in terms of specific checklists of items to go through as a mechanism of validating your design .
But each time you apply them , you internalise a part of them , and soon in 3 or more years of regular application , their application becomes internalised and ingrained .
At this stage you might even well forget that they exist , since you apply them subconsciously , day after day , time after time , and sometimes referring back to them only when debating or reviewing your designs with other designers .
The analogy to the painter is in the post referred to : Are You Following the Instructions on the Paint Can ? is also quite instructive .
The instructions on the paint can are for one time painters , hobbyists , amateurs etc .
No experienced painter is likely to be reading them since he 's probably internalised them .
But each seasoned painter would want every junior painter to learn the instructions and the costs of not following them before stepping up to deciding whether and when not to follow them .
He is unlikely to teach a new painter in the making - follow the instructions that make sense .
Sure you do make tradeoffs at times in design .
Most people tradeoff guidelines in all spheres .
However the keyword is to understand that you are breaking a guideline and then do so explicitly knowing its costs fully well .
My big difficulty with the post is that it is an advice which may do more harm to junior programmers than good .
It might encourage them to make tradeoffs before they learn the cost and implications of making the tradeoffs .
And it might set themselves away from a path that requires careful and judicious application ( which requires a lot of effort in the early days ) and helps them internalise the principles .
I would not recommend the post I refer to to any junior and upcoming programmer .
My advice is as follows .
If you have grown to a stage where you are applying these rules implcitly - do n't worry , you have the experience on your side to generally make the right judgement calls and you are likely to anyway apply them under most of the cases .
In such a situation , this post and the one it refers to are probably inconsequential to you .
If you are at a stage where you still need to review your design with respect to the SOLID principles ( or other appropriate design principles ) - please take your time to apply the principles , learn if you are breaking them , understand the costs of doing so ( I would recommend that involve a senior programmer / designer in the process ) and then by all means make the best judgement .
Principles distilled over time and experience should be adjusted preferably by those who understand the cost and implications of doing so , the rest should strive to reach that state first .
To clarify , the reason why I upfront made the statement " seems not grounded in sustained experience in applying the principles " , is that those who have internalised them hardly every feel the burden ( if at all ) of applying them , and are unlikely to ever ever treat it as an explicit checklist , and they seem like checklists to those who have n't internalised them .
Precisely the audience to whom you want to craft a more careful and nuanced message .
As a blogger myself , I ’ve always wondered what other people ’s workstations look like .
I realize many of you probably wonder the same thing , so I ’ve decided to prepare this post which includes photos of work spaces from popular blogs and websites .
Most pictures show Mac computers being used , sometimes in conjunction with PC ’s and / or laptops .
It ’s also interesting to see how some spaces are very clean and minimalistic , while others draw inspiration from busier set ups .
Thanks to all of you that participated in this fun article and sent their images .
Finally , if you have a popular website or blog and would like to be featured here , simply contact me so that I can include it here .
The article will be expanded as other photos get submitted over the coming days .
Now , let ’s go explore some interesting workstations and get inspired …

A key figure in Illinois Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich ’s alleged scheme to sell a U.S. Senate seat has sought immunity from federal authorities in return for his cooperation .
Businessman and political fundraiser Raghuveer P. Nayak is Individual D in the federal complaint , sources said .
Individual D was being squeezed by the governor for campaign cash , according to prosecutors , in order to appoint Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. ( D - Ill. ) to the Senate seat vacated by President - elect Barack Obama .
Investigators appeared at Nayak ’s home in Oak Brook , a Chicago suburb , the morning the FBI arrested Blagojevich , the sources said .
Federal agents that day contacted a number of people connected to the case .
Nayak has not been accused of wrongdoing .

He declined to comment for this article .
A 54 - year - old millionaire who made his fortune in medical businesses , he was little - known outside Chicago ’s close - knit Indian community and Illinois political fundraising circles until the governor ’s Dec. 9 arrest , which has made him a central figure in the scandal .
The Chicago Tribune has reported that Nayak hosted an Oct. 31 luncheon where he discussed raising $ 1 million for Blagojevich to help persuade the governor to choose Jackson .
The congressman ’s brother Jonathan appeared at a Nayak - sponsored fundraiser for the governor three days before Blagojevich was arrested .

The congressman has acknowledged speaking with Nayak about his desire for the Senate seat but said he was not aware of a fundraising effort to support his bid .
Jackson ’s lawyer , James Montgomery Sr. , reacted to the news of Nayak ’s bid for immunity by saying , “ If that is indeed the case , and if that cooperation relates to my client , then [ Nayak ] is trying to save his own skin .
That ’s all I have to say . ”
Attempts to reach the congressman were unsuccessful Sunday evening .
Only Blagojevich and his chief of staff are charged in the federal complaint , which alleges the two - term Democrat put a price on many of his official actions .

Federal prosecutors say the case epitomizes the worst excesses of a political system in which public officials raise money from people who want something from their government .
Those who supply the money are never far from government ’s most powerful players .
And that system would n’t exist without people like Nayak .
Federal and state election reports show that Nayak , his wife and his businesses for the last decade have donated more than $ 779,000 and raised hundreds of thousands more for candidates ranging from the Cook County circuit court clerk to Obama .
He has contributed primarily to Democrats but also to Republicans .
Nayak has been a notable contributor and fundraiser for three state officials who have been among the governor ’s harshest critics since the scandal broke -- Atty .
Gen. Lisa Madigan , Lt. Gov. Patrick Quinn and Treasurer Alexi Giannoulias .

Nayak and his longtime business attorney refused to discuss the Blagojevich case .
But the attorney , Thomas Conley , said his client is “ just a good guy ” and an honest businessman who stepped up when “ the Indian community recognized that it needed to have its interests heard by politicians . ”
Nayak has been a longtime supporter of Rep. Jackson , and he ’s traveled with the congressman ’s father , the Rev. Jesse Jackson , to India .
He also was a partner of Jonathan Jackson on a failed land deal .

A President Forgotten but Not Gone
By FRANK RICH
Published : January 3 , 2009
WE like our failed presidents to be Shakespearean , or at least large enough to inspire Oscar - worthy performances from magnificent tragedians like Frank Langella .
So here , too , George W. Bush has let us down .
Even the banality of evil is too grandiose a concept for 43 .
He is not a memorable villain so much as a sometimes affable second banana whom Josh Brolin and Will Ferrell can nail without breaking a sweat .
He ’s the reckless Yalie Tom Buchanan , not Gatsby .
He is smaller than life .

The last NBC News / Wall Street Journal poll on Bush ’s presidency found that 79 percent of Americans will not miss him after he leaves the White House .
He is being forgotten already , even if he ’s not yet gone .
You start to pity him until you remember how vast the wreckage is .
It stretches from the Middle East to Wall Street to Main Street and even into the heavens , which have been a safe haven for toxins under his passive stewardship .
The discrepancy between the grandeur of the failure and the stature of the man is a puzzlement .
We are still trying to compute it .
The one indisputable talent of his White House was its ability to create and sell propaganda both to the public and the press .
Now that bag of tricks is empty as well .
Bush ’s first and last photo - ops in Iraq could serve as bookends to his entire tenure .
On Thanksgiving weekend 2003 , even as the Iraqi insurgency was spiraling , his secret trip to the war zone was a P.R. slam - dunk .
The photo of the beaming commander in chief bearing a supersized decorative turkey for the troops was designed to make every front page and newscast in the country , and it did .
Five years later , in what was intended as a farewell victory lap to show off Iraq ’s improved post - surge security , Bush was reduced to ducking shoes .
He tried to spin the ruckus as another victory for his administration ’s program of democracy promotion .
“ That ’s what people do in a free society , ”  he said .
He had made the same claim three years ago after the Palestinian elections , championed by his “ freedom agenda ”  ( and almost $ 500 million of American aid ) , led to a landslide victory for Hamas .
“ There is something healthy about a system that does that , ”  Bush observed at the time , as he congratulated Palestinian voters for rejecting “ the old guard . ” 
The ruins of his administration ’s top policy priority can be found not only in Gaza but in the new “ democratic ” 
Iraq , where the local journalist who tossed the shoes was jailed without formal charges and may have been tortured .
Almost simultaneously , opponents of Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki accused him of making politically motivated arrests of rival - party government officials in anticipation of this month ’s much - postponed provincial elections .
Condi Rice blamed the press for the image that sullied Bush ’s Iraq swan song : “ That someone chose to throw a shoe at the president is what gets reported over and over . ” 
We are back where we came in .
This was the same line Donald Rumsfeld used to deny the significance of the looting in Baghdad during his famous “ Stuff happens ! ”  press conference of April 2003 .
“ Images you are seeing on television you are seeing over , and over , and over , ”  he said then , referring to the much - recycled video of a man stealing a vase from the Baghdad museum .
“ Is it possible that there were that many vases in the whole country ? ”  he asked , playing for laughs .
The joke was on us .
Iraq burned , New Orleans flooded , and Bush remained oblivious to each and every pratfall on his watch .
Americans essentially stopped listening to him after Hurricane Katrina hit in 2005 , but he still does n’t grasp the finality of their defection .
Lately he ’s promised not to steal the spotlight from Barack Obama once he ’s in retirement — as if he could do so by any act short of running naked through downtown Dallas .
The latest CNN poll finds that only one - third of his fellow citizens want him to play a post - presidency role in public life .
Bush is equally blind to the collapse of his propaganda machinery .
Almost poignantly , he keeps trying to hawk his goods in these final days , like a salesman who has n’t been told by the home office that his product has been discontinued .
Though no one is listening , he has given more exit interviews than either Clinton or Reagan did .
Along with old cronies like Karl Rove and Karen Hughes , he has also embarked on a Bush “ legacy project , ”  as Stephen Hayes of The Weekly Standard described it on CNN .
To this end , Rove has repeated a stunt he first fed to the press two years ago : he is once again claiming that he and Bush have an annual book - reading contest , with Bush chalking up as many as 95 books a year , by authors as hifalutin as Camus .
This hagiographic portrait of Bush the Egghead might be easier to buy were the former national security official Richard Clarke not quoted in the new Vanity Fair saying that both Rice and her deputy , Stephen Hadley , had instructed him early on to keep his memos short because the president is “ not a big reader . ” 
Another , far more elaborate example of legacy spin can be downloaded from the White House Web site : a booklet recounting “ highlights ”  of the administration ’s “ accomplishments and results . ” 
With big type , much white space , children ’s - book - like trivia boxes titled “ Did You Know ? ”  and lots of color photos of the Bushes posing with blacks and troops , its 52 pages require a reading level closer to “ My Pet Goat ”  than “ The Stranger . ” 
This document is the literary correlative to “ Mission Accomplished . ” 
Bush kept America safe ( provided his presidency began Sept. 12 , 2001 ) .
He gave America record economic growth ( provided his presidency ended December 2007 ) .
He vanquished all the leading Qaeda terrorists ( if you do n’t count the leaders bin Laden and al - Zawahri ) .
He gave Afghanistan a thriving “ market economy ”  ( if you count its skyrocketing opium trade ) and a “ democratically elected president ”  ( presiding over one of the world ’s most corrupt governments ) .
He supported elections in Pakistan ( after propping up Pervez Musharraf past the point of no return ) .
He “ led the world in providing food aid and natural disaster relief ”  ( if you leave out Brownie and Katrina ) .
If this is the best case that even Bush and his handlers can make for his achievements , you wonder why they bothered .
Desperate for padding , they devote four risible pages to portraying our dear leader as a zealous environmentalist .
But the brazenness of Bush ’s alternative - reality history is itself revelatory .
The audacity of its hype helps clear up the mystery of how someone so slight could inflict so much damage .
So do his many print and television exit interviews .
The man who emerges is a narcissist with no self - awareness whatsoever .
It ’s that arrogance that allowed him to tune out even the most calamitous of realities , freeing him to compound them without missing a step .
The president who famously could n’t name a single mistake of his presidency at a press conference in 2004 still can’t .
He can , however , blame everyone else .
Asked ( by Charles Gibson ) if he feels any responsibility for the economic meltdown , Bush says , “ People will realize a lot of the decisions that were made on Wall Street took place over a decade or so , before I arrived . ” 
Asked if the 2008 election was a repudiation of his administration , he says “ it was a repudiation of Republicans . ” 
“ The attacks of September the 11th came out of nowhere , ”  he said in another interview , as if he had n’t ignored frantic intelligence warnings that summer of a Qaeda attack .
But it was an “ intelligence failure , ”  not his relentless invocation of patently fictitious “ mushroom clouds , ”  that sped us into Iraq .
Did he take too long to change course in Iraq ?
“ What seems like an eternity today , ”  he says , “ may seem like a moment tomorrow . ” 
Try telling that to the families of the thousands killed and maimed during that multiyear “ moment ”  as Bush stubbornly stayed his disastrous course .
The crowning personality tic revealed by Bush ’s final propaganda push is his bottomless capacity for self - pity .
“ I was a wartime president , and war is very exhausting , ”  he told C - Span .
“ The president ends up carrying a lot of people ’s grief in his soul , ”  he told Gibson .
And so when he visits military hospitals , “ it ’s always been a healing experience , ”  he told The Wall Street Journal .
But , incredibly enough , it ’s his own healing he is concerned about , not that of the grievously wounded men and women he sent to war on false pretenses .
It ’s “ the comforter in chief ”  who “ gets comforted , ”  he explained , by “ the character of the American people . ” 
The American people are surely relieved to hear it .
With this level of self - regard , it ’s no wonder that Bush could remain undeterred as he drove the country off a cliff .
The smugness is reinforced not just by his history as the entitled scion of one of America ’s aristocratic dynasties but also by his conviction that his every action is blessed from on high .
Asked last month by an interviewer what he has learned from his time in office , he replied : “ I ’ve learned that God is good .
All the time . ” 
Once again he is shifting the blame .
This presidency was not about Him .
Bush failed because in the end it was all about him .

Political pull helped fix Scouts ' dam problem SCOUTING FOR DOLLARS : A special report
This is the fish ladder that the Monterey Bay Area Council installedon its recreational summer dam on the Little Sur River at Camp PicoBlanco .
The pipes fill with water , allowing steelhead trout to jump upthe ladder , from pipe to pipe , and thus migrate up river when the damwould otherwise block them .
The scouts denied responsibility forunlawfully killing steelhead trout , but agreed to settlement withfederal regulators that required them to install the fish ladder .
Scoutofficials say that including legal fees , the cost came to more than onemillion dollars .

The Boy Scouts of America 's Monterey Bay Area Council operated a summer dam on a pristine river and - despite official warnings - allegedly killed federally protected steelhead trout downstream .
And when state and federal regulators sought to have the council stop using the dam , Scout executives turned to politicians to whom they had given campaign contributions or with whom they had personal ties .
The Scout council avoided fines and quietly secured a favorable settlement agreement that , until now , has obscured a full account of their conduct at Camp Pico Blanco on the Little Sur River , north of the rugged Big Sur coast .
In interviews , Scout officials said they followed the rules in using the dam to create a lake for summertime swimming and boating .
They denied seeking special treatment from regulators .
" We are good stewards " of the environment , said Ron Walsh , who was a top official at the camp .
" But on the other hand , we recognized the value of the waterfront program to our kids , and we were not just going to sit idly by . "
The Chronicle obtained details of the June 2002 fish kill and its aftermath from documents obtained under the California Public Records Act and the federal Freedom of Information Act and in more than two dozen interviews .
The imbroglio at the Scout camp began when state Fish and Game officials sought to halt use of the dam about 12 miles south of Carmel , off Highway 1 , because it did not meet environmental standards .
But after the Scouts complained to then - state Sen. Bruce McPherson , R - Santa Cruz , officials agreed to let them continue using the dam .
The Scout council agreed to take precautions to protect the fish .
But within weeks , agents of the National Marine Fisheries Service discovered evidence that camp staff had ignored the safeguards and - rushing to fill the lake in hot weather - " dewatered " the river below the dam , killing at least 30 threatened steelhead trout in violation of the Endangered Species Act .
Concerned about future violations , the federal officials sought to stop the Scouts from damming the Little Sur until the dam met standards .
Scout executives again resisted , saying they needed to continue using the dam so Boy Scouts could use the lake to earn merit badges .
This time they enlisted help from Rep. Sam Farr , D - Carmel , who had attended the camp as a boy .
Ultimately , the council succeeded :
The fisheries service backed off and the Scouts were allowed to continue using the dam on the condition that they substantially improve it .
In interviews , McPherson and Farr confirmed that they had contacted regulators at the request of Scout officials .
They denied their actions were related to their personal ties or campaign contributions .
" Camp Pico Blanco is , if not the most , one of the best - recognized Scout camps in the state . " said McPherson .
" I think that 's probably why it got extra attention . "
Farr said he had done for the Scouts what he would have done for any constituent .
He called the final result " a win- win , " good for both the Scouts and the trout .
Pristine watershed
The Little Sur River winds some 23 miles down the slopes of the Santa Lucia Mountains in the Los Padres National Forest , passing through private land , including the Scout camp , before emptying into the Pacific .
The river " is as close to a pristine watershed as is known to exist " in the area , according to a fisheries service report .
The river is especially important to the steelhead .
The report says their numbers in the south central coast area have dwindled from about 4,750 fish in 1965 to about 800 in 2005 , because of pollution , erosion that clogs streams and dams that dry up waterways .
Since 1955 , the Monterey Bay Scouts had been using the summer dam on the Little Sur .
The concrete dam had a spillway about 10 feet wide .
Every May , the Scouts blocked the spillway with redwood " flash boards , " damming the river and creating a lake .
Thousands of Scouts came from around the state to swim , boat and learn water safety .
Each September , the boards were removed .
The lake was a source of income to the council , since other councils paid for their Scouts to use it .
For decades the Scouts operated the dam with the state 's knowledge .
But in 2001 , state and federal wildlife officials began enforcing tougher rules for recreational summer dams .
The steelhead had been listed as a threatened species and new laws protecting them had gone into effect .
That July , Jonathan Ambrose , a fisheries service biologist , visited Camp Pico Blanco and told Scout officials that if the dam provided insufficient flow downstream , it could harm the steelhead .
By April 2002 , Ron Walsh , the assistant Scout executive at the council , had submitted only an incomplete application to operate the dam that summer .
Yet he wanted a permit quickly , so the council could create the lake in time for the camp 's traditional Memorial Day opening .
A Fish and Game official , Linda Hanson , told Walsh it was too late :
Under the new regulations , the permit would require additional review , records show .
Walsh appealed to other Fish and Game officials , to no avail .
In May , according to the records , Hanson explained that a quick turnaround was n't possible " considering that this would need environmental review , the application was not complete and the site had not been visited . "
Examinations
Then Walsh phoned Hanson again , this time with his attorney on the line .
Hanson told them that summer dams around the state also were being examined .
The council would have to stop using the dam until it obtained a permit .
" The waterfront was one of the real highlights of the camp , " Walsh said in an interview .
" We were really between a rock and a hard place . "
At this point , the Scouts contacted state Sen. McPherson " to see if he could at least facilitate some discussions " with Fish and Game officials , Walsh said .
" We were not trying to get around anything . "
Over the years , McPherson had received campaign donations from firms affiliated with men who were active in Scouting : $ 35,500 from Granite Construction , whose president was David H. Watts , a member of the council board ; $ 5,000 from Chapin Construction , headed by Donald Chapin Jr. , a longtime council supporter .
In interviews , both McPherson and the donors said the contributions had nothing to do with the Scouts or their problem at the camp .
McPherson recalled contacting the head of Fish and Game , Robert Hight .
" It was n't a pressure - point discussion that I had with him , " McPherson said .
" It was more , ' I know that you 're in negotiations , can you get to a resolution and get specific as to what 's needed and satisfy both parties ? ' "
A McPherson aide also phoned Fish and Game headquarters in Sacramento , and the agency 's legislative office then queried Hanson about the project .
She explained that the Scouts had yet to submit a completed application , she wrote .
Hanson held firm when the Scouts ' Walsh phoned yet again .
" It does n't matter who you talk to in the department , the answer will be the same , " she said , according to the record .
" Basically the pressure being applied is asking us to do something we legally cannot do . "
Then on June 3 a news story titled " Scouts ' Summer Fun Dries Up " appeared in the Monterey Herald in which a council official complained that the state was unfairly forcing them to stop using the dam " at the last minute . "
' Any way to fix this ?!'
Later that day , Dirk Brazil , a deputy director of the Department of Fish and Game , faxed a copy of the Herald story to Robert Floerke , a Fish and Game manager and Hanson 's superior .
" Any way to fix this ? ! "
Brazil wrote on the cover sheet bearing the Director 's Office letterhead .
Within weeks , the Scouts ' problem was fixed .
Fish and Game reversed course and agreed to let the Scouts use the dam that summer without the standard permit .
The department said this would allow the state to study the dam 's potential harm to fish .
Hight said in an interview that he recalled nothing about the Pico Blanco issue .
" It does n't ring any bells , " he said .
At Fish and Game , " we received political pressure from legislators all the time , " said Hight , now a judge in Sacramento .
" But we always did the right thing . "
Brazil , now deputy Yolo County administrator , said in an interview that he did not recall how he learned of the Herald story .
He said he did " lots of problem solving " at the department and that it was not unusual for him to send faxes like the one he sent Floerke , the Fish and Game manager .
" If anything , this was me looking at something in my old backyard and asking a very simple question , " said Brazil , who grew up in Monterey County .
According to a federal report , Fish and Game officials were " concerned about the negative publicity . "
Floerke recalled that other Scout councils around the state had complied with the new regulations on summer dams , but at Pico Blanco " it was resistance all the way . "
He acknowledged that after Fish and Game headquarters intervened , his staff agreed to let the council keep using the dam .
" In a simplistic way , if you look at it , yeah , they backed down , " said Floerke , who is now retired .
With the state 's permission , the people who ran Camp Pico Blanco on July 8 , 2002 began to install the flashboards to dam the Little Sur and create the lake .
The Scouts had promised to fill the lake slowly , ensuring that the river had sufficient flow to allow fish downstream to survive .
But when fisheries service special agent Roy Torres arrived with a video camera to monitor the installation , he discovered that the Scouts did not have a gauge to measure the water flow , as required .
Nor had they retained a biologist to help with the installation .
Hot day
One camp staffer told Torres the council planned to take a week to fill the lake .
But a Scout parent told Torres the job would be done in just one day , as always .
It was a hot day , the parent said , and the Scouts wanted to go swimming .
Meanwhile , a camp staffer told Torres that " he has seen many trout in the river and did not see why there were so many regulations protecting them , " according to the agent 's report .
The agent explained that steelhead faced extinction and that was why he was videotaping , the report said .
Chastened , camp staff stopped installing the flashboards .
The next day , when a state official visited , the lake was only a few inches deep .
The third day
But on the third day - when no state or federal officials were present - the lake was quickly filled to a depth of 6 feet .
When fisheries service Special Agent Thomas Gaffney arrived a few hours later , he found that the stream below the dam had been de-watered , according to a report .
Caught among the rocks were 30 freshly killed steelhead , stranded and suffocated .
Gaffney believed more had been killed but had been swiftly devoured by raccoons and birds .
At the camp , Gaffney discovered that the " knife gate " - a slot at the foot of the dam that was supposed to remain open to permit stream flow - had been shut .
During the ensuing investigation , Kenneth W. Allen II , the council 's executive , and his assistant , Walsh , failed to fully cooperate , according to a federal report .
One Scout official suggested that unknown campers or " renegade " staff had filled the lake too fast .
In interviews , Allen and Walsh denied that any Scout officials failed to cooperate .
" As far as we know , we followed the protocol , " Walsh said .
" Why the fish died is anybody 's guess . "
In the end , the fisheries service concluded that the Scout council was responsible for the unauthorized killing of the steelhead :
The lake was filled too fast , de-watering the stream and beaching the fish , said a report .
Lawyers for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , the parent agency of the fisheries service , threatened the Scouts with a fine , which by law could have reached $ 396,000 .
They asked the Scouts to stop using the dam until they obtained permits and modified it to meet current standards .
Council leaders protested , saying the dam was " an integral economic and educational feature " of the camp .
They then turned to Rep. Farr .
An environmentalist , Farr last year received a Sierra Club award .
He sponsored the Big Sur Wilderness and Conservation Act of 2002 , which gave permanent protection to federal lands in the area .
As a former boy Scout , Farr also is a staunch supporter of Scouting - and Camp Pico Blanco .
" I was one of the first Scouts when it first opened " in the 1950s , he said in an interview , recalling that he earned his water safety merit badge in the lake created by the dam .
" My nickname as a kid was Fisherman Farr , " he added .
Scout officials have supported Farr , who had received at least $ 1,750 in donations from Granite Construction , where council board member Watts was president , and from another board member .
Farr then phoned NOAA on behalf of the Scouts .
Assistant General Counsel Michele Kuruc , who was in charge of regional deputies around the country , said she took the call .
" He did certainly recall some of these memories of his own childhood and experiences at the camp , " Kuruc said .
" And he wanted to talk about that a little bit with me . "
Negotiated settlement
Kuruc then phoned Amanda Wheeland , her subordinate handling the case .
" I was told I would be backing down and not be requiring as a condition of settlement that they stop operating the dam , " said Wheeland , who has since retired from the agency .
Wheeland added , " They were able , because of who they were , to negotiate a settlement agreement for the interim operation period that not everyone would have been able to get . "
Kuruc said the agency 's decision was based on many factors .
" It was n't as a result of Rep. Farr 's phone call , " said Kuruc , who is now with the U.N. Food and Agriculture Program .
Farr denied the Scouts received special treatment .
" Our constituents are treated all the same , " he said .
In June 2003 , the Scouts signed a settlement agreement with the fisheries service .
Though it was never made public , The Chronicle obtained a copy .
Instead of a fine , the deal required the council to install a fish ladder ; modify the dam 's spillway to allow steelhead to migrate upstream ; and enhance the stream bed habitat for fish .
The project cost more than $ 1 million , a council official said .
Although the settlement allowed council officials to operate the dam in the meantime , it required them to retain a qualified expert to monitor use of the dam to prevent fish kills and to educate campers about endangered species .
Scout officials admitted no wrongdoing in the agreement , which also shielded them from bad publicity : Neither the fisheries service nor the Scouts could issue a press release about the 2002 fish kill without letting the other party review it in advance .
The Scouts have complied with the settlement terms , said a fisheries official .
" My own experience of the Scouts is that they taught us to be good stewards of the land , " Farr said .
" Leave it better than you find it .
It 's been a motto that I 've used in politics ever since .
And I think frankly , the way this thing got worked out , it did do that . "
