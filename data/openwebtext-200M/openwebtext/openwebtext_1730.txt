Let ’s face it .
African Americans have created the majority of American culture in the 20th century .
By that I mean that their contributions to Music , Entertainent , and Culture have spanned the globe and left an everlasting impact upon the American landscape .
One need not look further than the influence of Hip Hop and Graffiti to see the lasting impression this minority has made on the planet .
Let ’s not forget about Jazz , The Blues , and Rock and Roll as well .
And alongside these great cultural strides we also see how the roots of marijuana prohibition are dangerously intertwined .

Penny - pinching at a time like this is n’t just cruel ; it endangers the nation ’s future .
And it does n’t even do much to reduce our future debt burden , because stinting on spending now threatens the economic recovery , and with it the hope for rising revenues .
So now is not the time for fiscal austerity .
How will we know when that time has come ?
The answer is that the budget deficit should become a priority when , and only when , the Federal Reserve has regained some traction over the economy , so that it can offset the negative effects of tax increases and spending cuts by reducing interest rates .
Currently , the Fed ca n’t do that , because the interest rates it can control are near zero , and ca n’t go any lower .
Eventually , however , as unemployment falls  probably when it goes below 7 percent or less  the Fed will want to raise rates to head off possible inflation .
At that point we can make a deal : the government starts cutting back , and the Fed holds off on rate hikes so that these cutbacks do n’t tip the economy back into a slump .
But the time for such a deal is a long way off  probably two years or more .
The responsible thing , then , is to spend now , while planning to save later .
As I said , many politicians seem determined to do the reverse .
Many members of Congress , in particular , oppose aid to the long - term unemployed , let alone to hard - pressed state and local governments , on the grounds that we ca n’t afford it .
In so doing , they are undermining spending at a time when we really need it , and endangering the recovery .
Yet efforts to control health costs were met with cries of “ death panels . ”
And some of the most vocal deficit scolds in Congress are working hard to reduce taxes for the handful of lucky Americans who are heirs to multimillion - dollar estates .
This would do nothing for the economy now , but it would reduce revenues by billions of dollars a year , permanently .
But some politicians must be sincere about being fiscally responsible .
And to them I say , please get your timing right .
Yes , we need to fix our long - run budget problems  but not by refusing to help our economy in its hour of need .

Aya Tanaka grew up eating Japanese curry in Brazil .
When she 's not cooking or parenting , she teaches eighteenth - century travel literature to undergraduates and researches early modern spice trade routes .
This week she introduces Serious Eaters to the joys of making and eating Japanese curry rice .
Japanese curry rice ( also known as " kare raisu " ) might be the homiest , most comforting of all Japanese dishes .
It is consumed two to three times a month on average in Japanese households , and is very easy to make .
Curry is indeed so Japanese that it's the standard meal in the Japanese Navy on Fridays , and is consistently voted one of the favorite meals in school cafeterias .
There are even reports that curry is the Japanese emperor 's favorite food .
I grew up with my Japanese father 's somewhat rudimentary , from - scratch version of curry rice .
It was only later in college that I learned about the ubiquitous blocks of curry roux that you simply add to a stew , magically turning them into curry .
There are currently five brands of curry available in Japanese grocery stores in the US : S&B 's Golden Curry and Torokeru ( Tasty ) Curry , and House 's Vermont Curry , Java Curry , and Kokumaro Curry .
They are all available in mild , medium hot , and hot versions .
I have also seen Golden Curry in supermarkets with Asian groceries sections .
Cooking with Curry Roux
For the taste test , I opted for the medium hot version and prepared each of them following package directions , in the most traditional way , employing only onions , potatoes , carrots and boneless chicken legs .
Although every Japanese person seems to have a special addition or method to enhance their curry , the basic recipe can't get much easier .
You sauté onions , carrots , potatoes and meat , add water , and cook until the vegetables are tender .
Then you turn off the heat , add and dissolve the curry roux blocks , and return it to a simmer for five minutes .
S&B actually has a great one - minute video that walks you through the process .
For the taste test , I decided to blind taste the five brands twice , once on the day I prepared them , and once the next day , as curry gets a lot better a day later .
I looked for distinctive traits in three separate categories .
Sweetness :
One of Japanese curry 's most distinctive characteristics is sweetness , often provided by the addition of fruit and sometimes honey .
It 's the first thing you taste when curry touches your tongue .

Spices : I was looking for brightness of spices , and perhaps some assertiveness , given that among the sweetness they might get a bit muddled .
The spices kick in about three seconds after the sweetness when you eat curry .

The spices kick in about three seconds after the sweetness when you eat curry .
Texture : Japanese curry is thickened with flour and sometimes corn starch , and the smoothness of the texture is an important vehicle for the delivery of both sweetness and spiciness .
The taste test demonstrated , unsurprisingly , that each curry roux lays somewhere between the sweetness and spiciness spectrum .
Some favor the first , some the latter .
Besides the liveliness of the sweet and spicy components , I think what makes curry special and a Japanese dish in its own right is the transition between the initial sweetness and the spice kick at the end .
Ultimately , it is the full experience , the balance between the two components that I was looking for .
Least Remarkable : Golden Curry
Golden Curry is perhaps the most traditional of the brands , and it is a straight curry — no claims to sweetness .
It has the shortest ingredient list among the five brands tested , with no fruits included .
Yet , despite the lack of sweetness to interfere with the spices , Golden Curry is also the blandest of the brands .
It 's a bit boring , the spices are not remarkable , and the curry 's consistency is a bit sticky , as though the wheat flour used to thicken it were not cooked enough .
Sweetest : Vermont Curry
I know — " Vermont " Curry sounds a bit weird , but I guess the addition of apples and cheddar cheese makes it a Vermonter .
What makes Vermont the sweetest of the curries tested here is also the addition of sugar and honey to the mix .
The ingredient list also lists banana and Gouda cheese , and you can actually taste both in the curry .
All these flavors , blended in a sauce a bit too thick , overwhelm the spices .
Vermont is sweet and comforting , and perhaps the reason why children are so fond of curry in Japan .
Spiciest : Java Curry
Java Curry is the spiciest of the five curries — " robust " , as the packaging claims .
It starts a little sweet as curry should , thanks perhaps to coconut paste in the mix , but right away the spices kick in , and they are harsh .
There is no subtlety in the transition from sweet to spicy , nor in the medley of spices .
Java Curry is perhaps for those who enjoy the heat and sweat resulting from a hot curry .
Best overall : Torokeru and Kokumaro
To be fair , it 's a bit of a tie .
Torokeru is perhaps the best of the curry rouxs because it 's so well rounded .
Its sweetness is derived from fruit ( apple ) and chutney , and there are hints of cheese .
The spices are well balanced and pleasant , and overtake the sweetness just right .
Kokumaro Curry is a bit sweeter than Torokeru , and the spices are a bit livelier .
Kokumaro also handles the transition between sweet and spicy well , although paradoxically , it seems as though there is less contrast between the tastes .
Basically , Torokeru is more balanced and distinct , and Kokumaru more assertive and blended .
The great difference between the two is that Kokumaro 's consistency is thinner and more elegant .
As with all House curries , they use corn starch as a thickener in addition to wheat flour .
How To Customize Your Curry
Given the distinct personalities of these curry rouxs , it 's not uncommon at all to blend two and perhaps more brands .
I could see Java giving Torokeru a kick , and Vermont mellowing down Kokumaro .
Personally , I had always been a fan of Java .
After the taste test , I will be making my curry 70 percent Kokumaro , 30 percent Java .
Sweetness levels may also be increased by adding apples , cubed or grated , to the stew ; spiciness may be heightened to individual tastes by adding chile powder , paprika , or black pepper .
You may also customize your spiciness level by mixing hot and mild curries ( same or different brands ) .

Twenty years ago , William Styron , the American author of Sophie 's Choice , wrote what many regard as the definitive account of severe depression in his memoir Darkness Visible .
Today researchers give scientific credence to his choice of title by demonstrating that people in the grip of despair do indeed see the world in shades of grey .
Depression not only drains life of its pleasure and its purpose ; it also drains the visible world of its contrast .
This " greying " effect may even be a factor in causing , or maintaining , the depression , the researchers suggest .
The findings may help explain why artists consistently depict depression using darkness .
Scientists at the University of Freiburg , Germany , who previously showed people with depression struggled to detect black - and - white contrast differences , have now carried out tests on the retina which show the impact of the illness is similar to turning down the contrast control on a TV .
The effect was so marked that they believe the test could provide a way of measuring the severity of depression .
The study , conducted by Ludger Tebartz van Elst and colleagues , is published in the journal Biological Psychiatry .
John Krystal , who edits the journal , said : " These data highlight the ways that depression alters one 's experience of the world .
The poet William Cowper said that ' Variety 's the very spice of life ' , yet when people are depressed , they are less able to perceive contrasts in the visual world .
This loss would seem to make the world a less pleasurable place . "
The researchers measured electrical responses to gauge the activity of the retina in groups of depressed and non-depressed individuals .
The retina , at the back of the eye , contains the sensitive cells that turn light signals into nerve impulses which , when interpreted by the brain , make it possible to see .
Depressed patients were found to have dramatically lower retinal contrast " gain " than the volunteers who were not suffering from depression .
It made no difference whether or not they were receiving antidepressant medication .
There was also a significant correlation between the level of contrast gain and the severity of their symptoms .
Patients who were most severely depressed had the lowest retinal responses .
The pattern was so consistent it was possible to distinguish highly depressed patients from healthy volunteers simply by looking at the test results .
With further work , " electro - retinogram " tests could provide a better way of assessing a patient 's mood than simply asking : " How do you feel ? " , the scientists say .
Dr van Elst said : " This method could turn out to be a valuable tool to objectively measure the subjective state of depression , having far - reaching implications for research as well as clinical diagnosis of and therapy for depression . "
Darkness may also cause depression .
Many people succumb in winter , when the light is low and sunshine in short supply .
Seasonal Affective Disorder ( SAD ) is often treated with bright artificial light , emitted by special lamps .
They are thought to stimulate the body 's biological clock but they may also improve contrast vision and thus improve mood in two ways .
Off - colour artists whose work described their mood
Claude Monet
He may be famed for his colourful water lilies but when Claude Monet sat down in 1879 to paint his dying wife Camille , the art he produced was distinctly sombre in tone .
Camille had been both Monet 's model and mistress before they married , sharing his poverty as the French artist struggled to make a name for himself .
Vincent Van Gogh Many of Van Gogh 's final paintings lack the bright intensity that dominate his early work .
' Wheat Field with Crows ' is the most famous example .
The bottom half of the painting , done just a month before the artist committed suicide , shows a bright yellow wheat field .
But the sky above the field is a menacing grey - blue .
Many have speculated whether that sky was an indication of the artist 's increasingly suicidal tendencies .
Forecasts from Cisco's Visual Networking Index reveal that P2P traffic is predicted to grow to more than 7 Petabytes per month by 2014 .
This is more than double the amount of data P2P traffic generated in 2009 .
The majority of the bandwidth consumption will be generated by BitTorrent , which is the dominant file - sharing protocol today .
Data consumption patterns on the Internet have changed rapidly over the last years .
Just five years ago some studies estimated that up to three quarters of all the bandwidth on the Internet was consumed by P2P traffic .
At the end of last year this bandwidth share was down to 39 % according to Cisco , and by 2014 it is expected to go down even further to 17 % .
This does n’t mean that there is a decline in interest for P2P or BitTorrent though , as the absolute traffic numbers are expected to rise year after year doubling to 7 Petabytes per month in the next four years .
However , as the rest of the total Internet traffic grows even stronger because of Youtube and other streaming sites , P2P traffic as a percentage of all Internet traffic will decline .
By the end of this year , P2P traffic will not be the largest Internet traffic type for the first time since 2000 .
Internet video traffic is expected to take over this honorary title for now , but this may very well change in the future as P2P video streaming will be widely adopted .
Aside from traditional P2P traffic including BitTorrent , eDonkey and Gnutella , file - hosting services such as Rapidshare and MegaUpload will continue to gain popularity in the coming years .
These other types of file - sharing services will grow explosively according to Cisco , increasing nearly eightfold to 4 Petabytes per month in 2014 .
Together all types of file - sharing traffic will nearly triple by 2014 , still accounting for 27 % of all Internet traffic .
Internet video is predicted to account for 46 % of all traffic in the same year .
Internet traffic market shares
The growth in file - sharing traffic will be most pronounced in Central Eastern Europe with an annual growth rate of 35 % .
North America sits in the middle with a growth rate of 21 % .
Western Europe stays behind with a meager 15 % a year , but this still means that file - sharing traffic will also double there in 2014 compared to 2009 .
The Asia -Pacific region will remain the center of file - sharing as it continues to account for nearly half of all file - sharing traffic on the Internet .
Cisco ’s Visual Networking
Index makes no prediction about BitTorrent ’s market share among P2P application but as the current trend continues it is expected to dwarf the competition .
Image caption Bart De Wever 's ultimate aim is Flemish independence
Belgium 's Flemish separatist party , the New Flemish Alliance ( NVA ) , has emerged as the largest force in parliament , with coalition talks set to start .
The NVA , whose ultimate aim is independence for Flanders , Belgium 's northern half , took 27 of 150 seats .
The Socialists from the southern half , Wallonia , came second .
Correspondents say lengthy coalition talks could undermine efforts to control Belgium 's debt and overshadow its upcoming EU presidency .
Belgium 's King Albert was expected to start consulting party leaders on Monday , on the prospects for forming a new government .
Desire for change
Some analysts believe the next coalition will take in as many as eight parties , the BBC's Dominic Hughes in Brussels reports .
Such a coalition might force the NVA leader Bart De Wever to tone down his nationalist rhetoric .
BELGIUM : A HOUSE DIVIDED Made up of Wallonia and Flanders ( and a small German - speaking community in eastern Belgium )
4 million French speakers in Wallonia
6.5 million Dutch speakers in Flanders
7.7 million voters
Political debate dominated by linguistic disputes
Debt - to - GDP ratio expected to exceed 100 % within next 12 months Language row looms over election
His supporters chanted : " Long Live a Free Flanders " as the result became clear on Sunday night .
Support for his party surged , increasing its representation in the lower house of parliament by 19 seats , according to near - complete results .
However , the Socialist party from French - speaking Wallonia also gained seats - giving it an expected total of 26 .
Combined with the Socialists from Dutch - speaking Flanders , it would form the largest bloc in parliament .
The party 's leader , Elio Di Rupo , could therefore become the first French - speaking prime minister since 1974 .
Mr De Wever said he would be prepared to back a Walloon as prime minister if that would bring more powers to Flanders .
" You do n't have to like each other to work together , " he said .
Mr Di Rupo acknowledged that the Flemish majority had " manifestly " voted for " institutional change " .
The result is a significant loss for Premier Yves Leterme 's coalition of Christian Democrats , Liberals and Socialists .
His government collapsed in April over a long - standing dispute about voting rights in municipalities around Brussels , and the election was brought forward by one year .
Separate lives
Much of public and political life in Belgium is dominated by bitter debates around language and the allocation of public resources .
Government aid to poorer Wallonia , home to four million French speakers , has caused resentment among Belgium 's 6.5 million Flemish majority , correspondents say .
Until now separatist parties have been on the fringes of political debate .
But Mr De Wever , 39 , has pushed his party into the mainstream over the last three years while the other parties have been locked in a political stalemate .
The country also faces economic problems , and some analysts say that Belgium cannot afford a long period of uncertainty .
During the last three years the national debt has grown to unmanageable proportions .
The country 's ratio of debt to gross domestic product is behind only Greece and Italy in the eurozone , analysts say .
Belgium is also taking on the six - month presidency in the European Union in July .
Normally the EU presidency gives a country a higher international profile .
But it may have come along at just the wrong time for Belgium if coalition talks drag on , our correspondent says .

Communicating with a submerged submarine has always been difficult , and since the submarine has to come up to periscope depth it has also been risky .
Now a new buoy developed by Lockheed Martin should enable stealth submarines to send and receive text messages while remaining safely at depth .
At present , nuclear submarines that remain at depths for weeks or even months can receive messages while submerged but cannot reply .
The transmissions are extremely low frequency ( ELF , at 3-3000 Hz ) , or very low frequency ( VLF , at 3000 - 30,000 Hz ) , and the antennas required are dozens of miles long .
Only a handful of ELF transmitters exist , and only two of them are in the US .
If the submarine needs to reply , or if complex communications beyond alphanumerics is needed , the submarine must come up to at least periscope depth to raise an antenna above the surface , and this makes the sub more vulnerable to attack .
Rod Reints , who leads the Lockheed Martin Communications at Speed and Depth program explained that many people think subs can easily make phone calls , but they do not really have that luxury .
There have been attempts to bring submarines onto the US Defense Department Global Information Grid along with all the other Navy ships , such as the High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program , which investigated using the ionosphere as an antenna for communication .
The idea was to excite the upper atmosphere with high - frequency radio waves , and it would then emit the ELF bands required for one - way communicate with submerged submarines .
The new system is the first two - way communication method for submarines at depth .
The actual depth is classified , but according to Reints the cables attached to the tethered buoys are “ measured in miles ” and would allow them to be launched from “ a significant depth . ”
The submarine could continue normal operations at its normal speed while communicating .
Lockheed Martin is developing three versions of the communication buoys in conjunction with Erapsco and Ultra Electronics Ocean Systems .
One version is tethered to the submarine and communicates with the sub via fiber optic cable and with the outside world via the Iridium satellite constellation .
A second version is also attached , but it communicates with the outside world via UHF .
The third version is an unattached acoustic - to - RF buoy that can be dropped from the air or launched from the submarine ’s garbage disposal chute .
All three versions are expendable .
The untethered buoys retain power for three days , while the batteries in the tethered buoys last for around 30 minutes .
When power is lost they scuttle themselves .
The one - meter - long buoys should enable submerged stealth submarines to be as connected to the Defense Department grid as any other vessel in the Navy .
At the moment the emphasis in on two - way text communications , but voice communication could also be possible and has been successfully tested on the Iridium satellite version .
The first buoys are expected to begin Navy sea trials by January next year .

Congratulations Verizon , you 're the latest wireless provider to lose a class - action early termination fee - related lawsuit !
It 's a dispute that 's been circulating in courts since 2008 , and while the settlement was agreed upon quickly , there were a few lingering appeals that have taken this long to get cleared up -- and not in VZW 's favor .
The issue at hand was the company 's $ 175 flat early termination fees , behavior that has proven legally naughty again and again when the same fee is levied regardless of whether you were one month or 20 months into your contract .
Each customer named in the suit will receive approximately $ 87.50 for their troubles , a total of $ 21 million Verizon will have to pay out .
That 's a bit more than AT&T got hit with back in January , but a whole heck of a lot less than Sprint 's massive $ 73 million fine .
TONIGHT UK viewers can enjoy a screening of Mel Gibson ’s The Passion of the Christ – a movie dubbed ‘ The Jesus Chainsaw Massacre ’ by one US critic .
It ’s a film that :
Lovingly and in detail recycles the bloody myth that all Jews are historically and collectively responsible for the murder of Jesus .
These are the words of Christopher Hitchens , who , in a Slate piece earlier this week , robustly tore into the “ paranoid , racist ” Gibson , identifying his latestÂ disgusting , racist outburst against the mother of his youngest child as the product of his upbringing in “ a fascist splinter group that believes it is the salvation of the Catholic Church ” .
Hitchens has recently been diagnosed with cancer of the oesophagus , and has begun chemotherapy .
And yet , his work has continued as brilliantly as ever .
This is important to me , as the man has been one of the single most significant influences on my life .
Most of the nicest things are said about people after they die , but I have no concern for such formalities .
After Hitchens ’ diagnosis , I am sure it brought a wry smile to his face to hear that some Christian preachers and other idiots quickly leapt to the offensive , declaring it a “ gift ” from God .
Is that so ?
Well , in a style Hitchens might approve of , we might notice that Â here is a man who has enjoyed a long , productive life , years of wealth and recognition , of book tours , signings and debates , travels around the world , of engagement with the world ’s finest minds , of raucous applause and standing ovations , of smoking and drinking at a now legendary pace , and that all the while , the heavens watched with folded arms …
A man of true enlightenment principles , Hitchens illustrates so clearly the distinction between the old and new left ; between those who stand with equality , and those who treat as a friend anyone that opposes capitalism ( Islamic fascists included ) .
He proved himself willing to turn away from even former friends when they allied themselves with theocratic or totalitarian forces , and in doing so showed the devotion of an ideological and principled mind .
Hitchens prompted me to see that my atheism must be political too .
I did n’t believe in any supernatural mind , and yet , those who claimed to know the wishes of such a mind wielded extraordinary power in real and not merely spiritual affairs .
This , I realized , had to change .
My newly discovered anti-theism inspired my first piece for the Freethinker , written at age 19 .
In his book , Letters to a Young Contrarian , I felt as if I was being addressed directly .
The book came at a pivotal moment , inspiring me to dedicate my life to the annihilation of the “ mind - forg ’d manacles ” and the institutions of their construction .
Hitchens showed me that theocracy was the great human evil ; that men with a weapon in one hand and a Holy book in the other encompass much of what is debased in thought and action .
And he managed it with charm and wit I had never expected to find in theological debate .
Chris “ call me Christopher ” Hitchens warned me that one must not have heroes , for we are all merely mammals : members of a fearful , semi-rational species with delusions of grandeur .
Not without his own unique weaknesses , Hitchens had claimed to have quit smoking , but would sneak away for his fix away from critical eyes .
I am skeptical of his ability to quit even now .
Similarly with drink , Hitchens ’ personal Christ went by the name of Johnny Walker , and Hitch might just be disciple number one .
I met him only once , in London .
I said , “ I ’m from the Freethinker . ”
He looked me over and replied , “ What ?
Are you serious ?
This is n’t some kind of trick ? ” I did my best not to be offended .
He told me that a lifetime of education is worth having , and said with a twinkle in his eye , that if I learn enough , someday someone might ask my opinion .
It is true that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery .
With that in mind , I raise my glass of Black Label to Christopher Hitchens , the badass of atheism , and to his speedy recovery .

Bloomberg and Benjamin Weinthal contributed to this report .
Lebanese newspaper Al Diyar reported Thursday that a former Lebanese army officer who is suspected of spying for Israel has fled Lebanon .
The man is currently in Frankfurt , the report said .
The suspect , Rasan al - Jud , is suspected of aiding Israel with the help of employees at Alfa , the state - owned mobile telecom company .
Lebanese security forces were searching for four other suspects – all technicians from the company – who have also fled Lebanon , the newspaper reported .
A German Foreign Ministry spokesman told The Jerusalem Post that “ the Foreign Ministry does not have any particular knowledge about the news item .
” Also Thursday , Al - Jazeera reported that Lebanon plans to file a complaint about Israeli “ espionage ” at the United Nations , according to the country ’s information minister , Tareq Mitri , who said a detailed report would be presented to the Security Council later this week .
At least 35 suspects have been arrested since an investigation was launched into allegations of spying by Israeli agents inside Lebanon in April 2009 .
In a related development , a Lebanese court sentenced a 58 - year - old Lebanese man to death on Wednesday after he was found guilty of spying for Israel .
The military court headed by Brig . - Gen. Nizar Khalil ruled that Hassan Ahmed al - Hussein gave Israel information on the location of the leadership of the Shi’ite Hizbullah movement , the state - run National News Agency said .
Hussein was convicted of contacting Israeli intelligence services in 2008 , entering the Jewish state without Lebanon ’s permission and illegal possession of weapons .
The ruling is subject to appeal by Lebanon ’s highest court .
The death sentence is the third handed down by a military court for a defendant found guilty of spying for Israel .

Earlier this week , I mentioned that " Incredible Hercules " co-star Amadeus Cho -- whose solo miniseries " Prince of Power " launched this week -- was the best kid sidekick of the past 30 years , and while that 's true , I did n't really have that much of a chance to go into the reasons why , and if you 're not one of the lucky people to have been following " Herc , " you might be wondering just what 's so great about him .
Well , aside from being generally well - written ( a key factor in any character 's success ) , Cho 's defining feature is that he 's smart .
Really smart .
Infuriatingly smart .
So smart that he can manipulate a team of heroes into punching out a Helicarrier :
So smart , in fact , that he 's consistently referred to as the 7th Smartest Person in the World , which would be a pretty impressive achievement for a teenager even if the world in question did n't have guys like Reed Richards , Tony Stark and Dr. Doom .
But all things considered , it 's pretty easy to say someone 's smart -- showing it 's a whole different matter , and that 's exactly what Greg Pak , Fred Van Lente and a host of awesome artists have done .
So today , for those of you who want to know more ( or fans who want a refresher course ) , I 've put together a list of The 7 Most Brilliant Moments of the World 's 7th Smartest Man !
#1 : OUT - MATHING A MISSILE
Although Amadeus Cho first appeared as one of the new characters introduced in " Amazing Fantasy " ( v.2 ) # 15 , most readers first saw him in the " World War Hulk " crossover , in which he fights ... with math .
Pretty ironic , considering that the rest of " World War Hulk " is pretty much just about Hulk straight - up smashing everything .
But it sets the tone for Cho , not only in that he uses his brain and whatever 's handy to do the impossible , but in that the creators found a way to make " super- intelligence " a visually interesting super - power without necessarily having it result in awesomely gigantic Reed Richardsy Kirby machines .
#2 : DEATH'S HEAD 3 GETS CHOWNED
Let 's be honest here , folks :
In Marvel comics , you 're not really a super - hero until you fight a killer robot from outer space , an achievement Cho knocks out pretty handily in the sewers of Manhattan during " WWH . "
It 's another great example of his ability to use anything , but it also makes him the only guy in Marvel Comics who can honestly say " I took out Death 's Head with a pebble . "
# 3 . HACKING IRON MAN
Again , hacking into allegedly unhackable technology is pretty much de rigeur for super - heroes -- in fact , whenever something shows up that can't be hacked , it 's a pretty safe bet that it will be hacked in about four pages -- but Cho manages to break into a cutting edge Iron Man suit ... with a friggin ' GameBoy .
I mean , look at that thing !
It 's not even a GameBoy Color !
Okay , okay , if you want to get technical , it 's pretty easy to write it off as just a GameBoy case wrapped around a homemade super - computer ( the original Gameboy being large enough to contain four iPhones and a sandwich ) , but still : hacking into Iron Man with only four buttons and a D - Pad .
That 's pretty impressive .
#4 : EROMENOS OR EROMENOT ?
With super - genius characters , it 's very easy to fall into the trap of making them so smart that the reader has a hard time relating to them , but Pak and Van Lente have gone out of their way to make sure that does n't happen with Amadeus Cho .
I mean , who among us has n't had to explain to a foxy , snake - haired Gorgon in a Naughty Schoolgirl outfit that we 're not the eromenos of the massive , hairy - chested , skirt - wearing bodybuilder we hang out with ?
For those of you who do n't know , " eromenos " -- which straight up redirects to " Pederasty in Ancient Greece " on Wikipedia -- was an Ancient Greek term for a teenage boy taken as a lover by an older aristocratic man , and as Delphyne Gorgon says , it was n't exactly uncommon .
But outside of fan - fiction , it 's not a role Cho fills for Hercules , and while his argument might not look very convincing , it was good enough to convince Delphyne .
And really , that 's the tricky part .
#5 : MACKING ON THE AMAZONS
The infamous thumbs - up panel is going to go down as one of " Incredible Herc 's " lasting contributions to Comics Internet Culture , but what most people leave out is the accompanying reaction shot from Cho , who -- after successfully convincing the Amazons of his non-eromenos status -- is attempting to mack on their queen , the Suicide Girl-ish Princess Artume .
And for Cho , " macking " means " figuring out ancient encoded Atlantean maps . "
Unfortunately , she only wanted him for his mind .
#6 : SAVING THROWS
During a confrontation with the sinister Pythagoras Dupree -- essentially Cho's predecessor , who defines himself as the sixth smartest man in the world -- Cho comes to the realization that he is himself a " living hypercomputer , " capable of analyzing a situation from an infinite number of angles and determining the best course of action .
And he discovers this , of course , through a scenario based around tabletop roleplaying games .
Which makes perfect sense .
After all , where else do nerdy kids learn to manipulate random chance in their favor ?
#7 : BRAINFIGHT
Like Cho , Dupree is also has the mind of a hypercomputer , and his entire motivation for trapping his younger counterpart -- which began with the murder of Cho 's parents -- was to force a final confrontation wherein he was going to try to shoot him in the head .
It sounds pretty simple , but Cho 's intelligence gives him the ability to predict where the bullets are going and dodge accordingly , so the challenge was for Dupree to determine where he was going to dodge and shoot there instead , unless Cho could out - think him by two steps ahead .
It is , quite possibly , the most tense scene in comics ever of two guys staring at each other while doing math .
Until Cho decides to end things " War Games " style .
J.D. Hayworth , free - money - from - the - government pitchman
Dan Nowicki uncovers a 2007 infomercial that just - defeated former congressman J.D. Hayworth cut for the National Grants Conference , a flashy group that charges $ 1,000 or more to attend seminars on how to get your hands on government grants .
It 's ... embarrassing .
Hayworth 's campaign explains to Nowicki that his involvement with the group started and ended in 2007 -- a hint at just how bad this looks for a small government challenger to Sen.
John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) .
He 's seen in the video adding credibility to the enterprise , framing it as a way to take power back from a rapacious federal government .
" This is something you should take advantage of , " says Hayworth .
" Why leave it to the big boys on Wall Street or even the business owners on Main Street ?
Bring it to your street , to your home .
Come to one of the National Grants Conferences . "
Side note : Matthew Lesko , whose exclamation mark - covered suits have made him the most recognizable figure in the free - money - from - the - government trade , is a libertarian who 's mocked his own practice in a Reason.tv video making fun of the stimulus .
That 's after the jump .

Hollyoaks producers are to tackle of one of only remaining taboos in soapland as a new member of the Costello clan will suffer from Gender Identity Disorder ( GID ) .
Soaps newcomer Victoria Atkin , 23 , will take on the role of Jasmine Costello , who arrives in the village having spent the summer at a camp in America .
While Heidi's ( Kim Tiddy ) delighted to have her daughter back home , it quickly transpires that she is hiding a huge secret .
Soon after returning to the family fold , Jasmine 's clandestine double life is revealed when her male alter ego Jason emerges as a prominent and overbearing part of her world .
GID - or Gender Dysphoria as it is also known - is when a person is born as one sex but has a desperate desire to be the other , dressing up and acting like the opposite sex in the hope that it will become reality .
Jasmine 's journey will highlight the mental trauma , physical disgust and ongoing frustration of a boy trapped in a girl 's body , as well as the effects that her condition has on those around her .
Left : Victoria as Jasmine - Right : Victoria as Jason
Series producer Paul Marquess said of the storyline : " I am proud that Hollyoaks is able to tackle the issue of GID and the effect the condition has on the families . "
He continued : " Around one in 4,000 people in Britain are receiving medical help for Gender Dysphoria and if we can bring the issue to the forefront to help more young people identify and talk about the condition , then I believe that can only be a positive thing . "
Commissioning editor for Channel 4 drama Roberto Troni added : " Hollyoaks has a track record for tackling challenging issues in a sensitive and intelligent way .
The upcoming GID storyline should not only help raise awareness about the subject , but ask important questions about identity , sexuality and gender that teenagers face . "
He added : " It will make for thought - provoking drama that will have a broad relevance to the Hollyoaks audience . "
Atkin is currently filming at the soap 's home in Liverpool and will make her screen debut at the beginning of August .

low quality jpeg compression , exaggerated low quality jpeg compression , exaggerated
Introduction
One of the first things a photographer learns about image formats is that JPEG image compression is “ lossy ” , meaning that the smaller file produced by greater compression comes at the cost of lower image quality .
How much lower — whether low enough to “ matter ” — depends on the situation .
JPEG compression can be remarkably effective at reducing the size of the image , so despite the lowering costs of storage space and bandwidth , the reduced size is still very appealing : storing essentially the same image in one fifth the file size , for example , means uploading five times faster .
The compression setting is usually controlled in camera with a “ basic / standard / high ” quality setting , each using progressively less compression .
Most image - processing applications , though , use a “ 0 - 100 quality ” or “ 0 % - 100 % quality ” sliding scale , and Adobe Lightroom is no exception :
JPEG Quality Setting in the Lightroom Export Dialog JPEG Quality Setting in the Lightroom Export Dialog
It 's easy to figure out that that “ Quality : 0 ” is less quality than “ Quality : 100 ” , but what does it really mean ?
The JPEG standard is full of complex math that I do n't understand , and I suspect you do n't either , so it 's not exactly intuitive what these “ quality settings ” ( “ quality percents ? ” ) really mean .
This barrier to understanding is exacerbated by the fact that different applications tend to implement the settings in different ways , so “ quality 73 ” means one thing in one app and another in another .
Adding to the confusion for Lightroom users is the fact that Lightroom 's JPEG quality setting is unique : it 's different from every other photo - processing app I know , including other Adobe products .
“ Quality 73 ” in Lightroom , for example , is not the same as “ Quality 73 ” in Photoshop or any other app that I know of .

For the rest of this post :
Lightroom 's Two “ JPEG Quality ” Surprises
I 've been working with digital images for a long time , and have dug around in some aspects to a fairly deep degree ( particularly color spaces , raw compression , and white balance ) , but was surprised by Lightroom 's JPEG - quality settings in two respects :
“ 0 quality ” is not zero —
With some photos , you get pretty good results even at Lightroom quality 0 , more than good enough for web thumbnail use , for example , where the substantial savings in size ( often more than a 90 % savings ! ) make the slight tradeoff worth it .
“ Quality 0 ” in Lightroom might be roughly comparable to “ Quality 50 ” in many non-Adobe apps .
We 'll see some compelling examples below .
“ 0 - 100 ” is really “ 0 - 12 ” — Lightroom maps the 101 points in its 0 - 100 quality scale to only 13 different quality outputs .
Setting the Lightroom quality to 70 , for example , results in the exact same output as setting it to 76 , or anything in between .
7 is the same as zero , and 93 is the same as 100 .
The full mappings are shown in the examples below .
Those familiar with Photoshop will recognize 13 as the number of quality settings in Photoshop 's Save - as - JPEG option ( with 0 being “ Low quality ” , up through 12 being “ Maximum Quality ” ) .
I have n't tested whether these are indeed the same except for the numeric scale presented to the user , but I suspect they are .
( For those wondering , Lightroom does not match Photoshop 's “ Save for the Web ” 0 - 100 scale , either : with “ Save for the Web ” , a quality of 70 produces a result that is actually different than that produced with a quality of 76 , so it can't be the same as Lightroom , where 70 and 76 are identical . )
An Example
Let 's look at an example , a lightened version of the shot from this sunset post last month ...
In the javascript - powered tool in the gray box below , you can see a full - resolution “ actual pixels ” crop from the photo created at various export qualities .
Initially it shows the highly - poserized “ Lightroom quality 0 ” version , but if you mouse over the buttons at the bottom , other versions load , all the way up the scale to “ Lightroom quality 100 ” ( the “ 93〜100 ” button ) ....

As you sweep the mouse over the buttons from left to right , there 's an initial dramatic increase in visual quality at relatively small costs in increased file sizes , but these trends quickly reverse so that toward the higher - quality end of the scale , there 's little to no improvement in visual quality as the file size explodes by leaps and bounds .
To my eye at a glance the 70〜76 quality is just fine , but if I really look carefully with a critical eye , tipping my laptop LCD screen at an angle , I see uneven gradients even in the lossless version .
This might well reflect that the sunset sky was not perfectly smooth ( ! ) , but the pixel - peeper in me wonders whether this smooth - gradient challenge was too much even for the basic technology of the camera image sensor .
Quality - Inspector Features
In visually comparing one quality level to another , it 's very helpful to swap back and forth quickly between the two samples , as it hyper - highlights differences , revealing details of the difference that one would never otherwise notice .
While this is useful , it 's important to maintain a sense of perspective about what viewers will eventually see and actually notice on their own .
Do n't let yourself get carried away by raw pixel - peeping alone .
Comparing quality levels :
Comparing adjacent quality levels —
Comparing adjacent quality levels is as simple as panning the mouse back and forth between the adjacent quality buttons .
Comparing a quality level versus perfect —
Bringing the mouse just below a button reverts the display to the “ lossless ” perfect - quality version , so sweeping the mouse up and down into the button then below it toggles between the view for that button and the perfect - quality version .
Comparing any two quality levels —
Selecting the small circular checkbox below a quality button makes that button the one reverted to when the mouse is brought under a button , so you can select the checkbox for one quality , then move to the button for the other and pan up and down to toggle between the views .
Again , I 'd like to suggest keeping this pixel - peeping in perspective .
It 's easy to let yourself get carried away to the point that you start to find fault where there 's not , or finding importance in some minor fault that wo n't at all be apparent to your intended audience .
A Totally Different Example
Let 's look at a photo with very different compression results .
Here 's an image of some reed shades hanging in front of the window of an old house near my place in Kyoto ( the same window seen in this post from last year ) .
It 's a fairly boring shot , but I 'd thought it might make for an interesting desktop background photo .
This scene has a lot fine detail in the many thin reeds making up the window shades , so you'd be forgiven if your first instinct would be that this image would require high JPEG quality for acceptable results with all that detail , but it 's just the opposite : there 's almost no difference in appearance between the “ Lightroom quality 0 ” setting and lossless ( perfect quality ) TIFF output , but the file size difference is remarkable : the TIFF , even when compressed ( with lossless ZIP compression ) is still more than 15 times larger , while an uncompressed 16 - bit TIFF is more than 50 times larger ( ! )
Again , here are full - resolution “ actual - pixel ” crops ...

As you sweep the mouse over the buttons from left to right , the file size increases considerably as the “ quality ” goes up , especially in the last few steps where again the size explodes by leaps and bounds , but you really do n't seem to get additional visual quality for the extra bytes .
Overall , there really does n't seem to be much difference at all over the entire range , from the the 174k - byte lowest - quality JPEG version to 1.4 megabytes for the highest - quality JPEG version , except perhaps some halos in the low - quality version near the vertical string lines tying the reeds together , but these are gone by the time you get to the next quality level .
Plenty of other differences make themselves known when quickly toggling between views , but in a static view they 're mostly lost among the many details of the photo , and I suspect that when presented with the perfect version and the second - to - the - lowest quality version , only those with a trained eye would be able to pick which was which .
The difference from the first example is stunning , and relates to what visual changes human are sensitive to : we pick up on imperfections in a continuous tone much more readily than slight changes in varied detail .
The JPEG compression algorithm is built around this difference , trying to preserve quality in these smooth gradient areas , but as well as it does , a photo like the sunset presents a daunting challenge .
The lack of detail in the sunset example is reflected in all versions by a drastically - decreased file size compared to the reed - shade example .... the sunset 's smooth gradients compress well , so all quality levels compress much more than their highly - detailed counterparts in the reed - shade example : for the same size result , the lowest - quality versions come in at 34 k and 174k respectively , while the highest - quality versions weigh in at 445 k and 1.4 megabytes .
One thing I find interesting ( but do n't understand ) is that in the first example , the difference in file size between the 47〜53 quality and 54〜61 quality is considerable ( 49 k to 66 k bytes ) , while in the second example , the the same two levels of quality produces essentially the same file size .
There seems to be some kind of switch in compression algorithm once Lightroom is at a quality setting of 54 or above that puts the emphasis on encoding the easily - discernible smooth gradients of the sunset example , and if they are lacking in the image , as with the reed - window - shade example , the attempt at extra quality fails , and the file size does not increase .
That 's my guess , but it 's just a guess .
Let 's look at an example mixed with lots of detail and various areas of smoothness ...

The areas of fine detail seem to firm up at about the 39 〜46 quality level , and the areas of smoothness seem fine there too , but the pixel - peeper in me might want to bump up the quality setting a few levels so that quick toggling reveals less fluctuation in the background .
Five more examples follow , of various types , for your pixel - peeping , compression - understanding enjoyment ...

Conclusions
First of all , you can't directly compare Lightroom 's JPEG quality settings with any other application .
The settings may well map directly to Photoshop 's save - as - JPEG 0 〜12 scale , and they may well partially map to Photoshop 's “ Save for the Web ” settings , but all bets are off when it comes to the JPEG quality setting on non-Adobe applications .
They 're just totally unrelated to how Adobe does it .
( I should make it clear that the difference is neither good nor bad ; I 've presented nothing here about how any other application creates JPEGs , so there are no conclusions to draw about which might be better or worse than Lightroom ; the important point is to recognize that the scales , even if sharing the same “ 0〜100 ” labels , are absolutely completely unrelated . )
The Lightroom default JPEG export quality of 75 , falling in the 70〜76 range , seems to provide for as good a visible result as the highest quality setting for all the samples except for the bridge , which seems to suffer at least slight posterization banding at all levels , including even “ lossless TIFF ” .
The file size , even at this relatively high 70 〜76 setting , is still about one third that of the 93〜100 setting , so is well worth it in most situations .
Those who blindly use the maximum setting for their exports likely waste a lot of local disk space , upload bandwidth , and remote storage space .
But conversely , those who blindly use some lesser setting risk posterization in the occasional photo with an unlucky sky gradient .
Overall , my recommendation is to understand the situation , allowing you to avoid acting blindly .
About These Examples
To produce these examples , I used a plugin for Adobe Lightroom to export each photo at Lightroom 's 13 different JPEG quality settings , and also as a losslessly - compressed TIFF , at a reduced size of 1518 ×1010 ( down from my Nikon D700 's native raw resolution of 4256 × 2832 ) , with medium screen sharpening and minimum embedded metadata .
These are the versions used for the file - size graphs .
These image files have some extra stuff added by Lightroom — a few metadata items , an embedded thumbnail image , and an embedded sRGB color profile — that is the same regardless of the quality setting , so one school of thought would have me remove them before creating the file - size graphs , to isolate just the quality - related differences among the files .
However , I thought it best to leave them there to keep these examples realistic , since since Lightroom will leave them there you export .
The crops you actually see in this post were exported similarly , then converted to losslessly - compressed PNG images for the presentation on this web page .
( Presenting the compressed JPEGs directly would have been problematic because a common browser , Firefox , does not handle display of JPEGs very well , sometimes introducing horrible posterization that does not actually exist in the image . )
This kind of reduced - size test is appropriate for many cases , but less so when you are considering exporting JPEGs for archive , or large JPEGs for print .
To address this area , I 've created the same eight samples as above , but without any image - size reduction , and without any additional export sharpening .
This current web page is already a bit heavy , image wise , so I 've placed the full - resolution images on a separate page , here .

Verse 1 : He left work for a 2 - week leave Overdue for some rest indeed Heading north to a place upstream
Where his wife and his son now waited to receive
One quiet home deep in retreat
Where nobody would know where to reach
It was oh so sweet But imposition of warfare would hit square and turn off delight
And the shock had a force to invite Such a fear that would drive him to flight Cuz it turned out his wife was n’t safe on this night A fear that would cause him to pause
And to pull from his draw his Benelli M4
And to haul in his jeep full floor With a vengeful jaw on an end life score
But before he could settle this he was bedeviled and blown
By the way she ’d hung up the phone
Her last words now a drone
They had him feeling just oh so cold
We are not alone
We are not alone Verse 2 :
And when it hits you get hit with it And when it breaks you get broke with it And when it lights you explode in it And when it goes you just loathe in it This is what you call an upheaval Something like a nightmare ’s equal
But he had the presence of mind
To reject thought lines of heroic retrieval Cuz he heard the panic in her tone
And he felt the weight of unknown
He sensed their helplessness
In the best defense called the local patrol And dispatch arranged for a probe Meanwhile he tried redial on the phone About 4 hours till he showed Rushed into the house to find no one was home Verse 3 : Full search ensues Up and down stairs through every room A lay of the grounds brought views without vehicles or shoes
He was quite confused
No evidence of forced entry
No signs of struggle , there ’s no sign of trouble
He refused to accept this He would attempt connections
No , the search resumes
If no footprints then he knew Entry had to be gained from the chimney ’s flue From the rooftop and trees he drew A path to the woods , now he left to pursue 30 acres till the river brought it through With this much land he ’d need a plane or a few Well the Feds made it two and the search party grew But nothing ever did yield any clues
That was 10 years ago 10 years of no rest and nowhere to go For 10 years he prayed it a ruse 10 years of theories , no truth
We are not alone
Verse 1 : Now this one starts under a fine bliss
With happiness and a divine kiss A loving home including three kids
When all was well before the sickness
But this one comes with an affliction Consulted doctor with condition
And he found cancer in position
Now he brings dreadful premonition Now I do n’t know from superstition
Or times when a soul has to turn to religion
But this young woman was faced with decision
How to fight in a war of attrition
And how to cope
And how to try And how to reach
And how to rise
And how to live with her remaining time
And how to hope for something she can’t find Never in her mind Ever did it climb to a place where her will was resigned Faith so high they could slow down time
And turn these years to an endless shrine
But this is certainly a misfit
And it sure hurts to have to heed it Cuz she do n’t need no one ’s forgiveness
She just needs something to fix this Chorus : I know you ’re worried Do n’t be afraid I ’ve always loved you I ’ll always love you You ’re pain it makes my body hurt
You need to know I ’ve always loved you I ’ll always love you Verse 2 : Like waking up in a dream
And finding it ’s quite a new scene
With a hairless head and a grief so mean
And a sense of a used reprieve Cuz his wife ’s now frail and she ’s far too lean
And no one ’s coming to intervene
No one sure with a cure to be received
And she is ready to be relieved Now there ’s nothing left to do but breathe
Now I ca n’t speak from in the family
Or feign like I know firsthand their misery Cuz how could a father just ignore
His family of five will soon become four
And how does a woman tell her husband to hold on When times get tough and she ’s left and long gone
How does a mother tell her daughter to be strong
For two younger brothers who have shuddered to move on And it ’s so damn heavy the weight ’s on It ’s too unsteady to ride on But he ’s determined to pull through this terminal worldview
And come out it brand new And no husband should have to bury you Cuz we all know that it can bury you Your warmth is felt and we do cherish you Know you ’re in our hearts Chorus : I know you ’re worried Do n’t be afraid I ’ve always loved you I ’ll always love you You ’re pain it makes my body hurt
You need to know I ’ve always loved you I ’ll always love you I know you ’re worried Do n’t be afraid I will always love you And I hear your call Remember me …
Verse 1 : Feelings overflow
And I ’m not letting go Though in my heart I know I know Chorus : Do n’t wanna be over you ( 3 x )
But you are not you Verse 2 : She said this was n’t easy for her Deciding to walk away was n’t easy to her And she said , she felt the world was just something that she observed That she was inadequate
That her place had n’t been earned She said , she was n’t happy with how her life had turned Feeling the real her was something she had to learn I said , this is n’t easy but I support unnerved Believing that in time she ’d wake up and return
But hope would fade as those few days had turned to weeks
And those weeks created something of which I could n’t speak Except to say it spoke as if I was n’t me As if we now had n’t been together since we were teens
As if these nine years were from a convincing dream
And the woman I thought I loved never loved me , I ca n’t conceive
This had to be a thing Sort of like a changeling
It acted and spoke the part
But her essence it could n’t sing Chorus :
Do n’t wanna be over you ( 3 x )
But I ’ll just have to make it through Cuz you are not you Verse 3 : When you ’ve gone astray
And the world just wo n’t obey
When you fall away Well we all must find our own way Verse 4 :
It ’s quite amusing how being apart can yield Levels of clarity on confusion once thought surreal
And what amazement to come to find you can heal
That one ’s future is n’t ill - fated but slated for high appeal Well solace gives opportunity to reveal
And time sheds perspective on why one feels
To see success even in division ’s the test
Well every day we had was n’t anything short of blessed So changeling , change brings
More than deranged things Strange things I ’ve near persevered in an upswing
So cling to new hope More than a good show So do sing , do glow And to this new you Let us remove ado Let us now greet renewed and just start from a different view I ’ll introduce myself
Now you introduce yourself
We ’ll smile and live in health as two friends who have never dwelt Chorus :
Do n’t wanna be over you ( 3 x )
But you are not you Do n’t wanna be over you ( 3 x )
But you are not you You are not you ( 5 x )
Verse 1 : Only notions he considers are hollowed and lost thoughts Visions that confer only sorrow that time ’s caught A ghost upon a body so shoddy and scared soft A mind so terrified it ’s resigned and it ’s shut off
But that ’s to be expected when a boy has been selected
In his hands is placed a weapon as a soldier then directs him Shoot upon your father
To refuse you ’ll burn in horror
No pursuit of pride and honor
He just stands immersed in sweat Family eyes connect
He holds his rifle to his chest
His heart is heavy with regret as he unloads with his offence And “ in the name of freedom ” is chanted to loud applause
While planted in his brain is an image of Hell crossed Sobbing in his spirit and fearing the holocaust
He must compose himself or risk being the next lost Now every shadow hides a face he ’s shot or blown to dust
With every day he ’s dying and getting more out of touch
And every night he dreams he ends the death machine
And finds a way to run from his stranger and this regime
As morning leaves him choking and full of grief
He ’s hoping today will be the day that brings him a reprieve Chorus
If only we could find the fortune Instead of misfortune Would be see it ’s out of proportion
Or have we cut off our feet No way to retreat
In nothing but defeat
But if we can get us lost And try to take it off Could we clean up this distortion
Try to make it soften
Are we all orphans now Have we exhausted now And I never loathed a life
But now I lead this war with me Verse 2 : I suspect my calm ’s Manchurian in nature Just a matter of some time before she makes me waste ‘ em Yet I possess no fury toward this stranger
No I just feel allured by coming danger Change her I would n’t I want to ride the current of her storm Nourish on her sword And let my soul absorb
And he of pure mind , let him to me accord Benevolence to ward off temptation that I have stored Cuz lord knows the craving in me grows
With every step I took I knew the devil in me rose Waiting on a precipice so delicately posed A long and lovely fall no will or fire can oppose
But the beauty of her form brings violence
And I succumb to dancing with this Siren And I can feel the weight of this unload Perception has been altered now I see what she ’s bestowed
The wrath in me explodes and the sins of men are found
The power of her sound reveals malevolence abound
To he who sees no heaven amongst the clouds
The reckoning is coming , get ready for buried ground
Yet I can feel such impurity within I must expel the fiend and let its hole cave in And so to singe this evil now I pull the pin
But clutch it to my heart to end the journey of my twin Chorus
Verse 1 : You never know your shot at fame is over till it passes
Till the hourglass is empty and it ’s backwards
And in the vacuum you just wonder how this happened
As the artist in you now gets enveloped inside a casket I ’ve put much money and time into this passion Never really thought it would end in quite this fashion
But life is what it is and I ’ll never regret the path I ’m just depressed my art never made it to reach the masses Just average , no better and no preferred I guess I felt I had something worthy to give this world Perhaps it was conceit to have thought I would move the herd Ego to think I ’d lead to new standard with note and word And foolish to believe a new paradigm would spur
But though absurd I wo n’t apologize I wo n’t acknowledge my pursuit was just an empty try
So be advised and have the knowledge from this poem occurred
This from the greatest artist in the world you never heard
Well it do n’t matter I ’m sitting inside an empty room Alone with no one present to hear the music boom Like Beethoven or Bach without a chance to bloom
Or for Shakespeare ’s words never to be consumed I just hope that one day my work will be exhumed
To infuse with higher levels now un-pursued
And that maybe the spirit in this will surge
And turn the world into something in which I ’m heard Verse 2 : I ’m inside these four walls I feel confined by four walls
Yes , my mind is four walls
Where thoughts come forth and design rhymes for y’all Just my flow , the audio and my pen Well , written it ’s a 10 But no audience attends Still I ca n’t give in The feeling wo n’t descend I do n’t do this just because , there ’s a cause I defend
So the music never ends I ’m not the caged bird that never sings I ’m the bird in the cage that breaks his wings
Trying to escape from where I feel trapped
So I keep shouting my raps
The sound waves bouncing back
It hits my frame , recharges my spirit
Then clicks my brain , responds with lyrics much stronger than the last Some day this sonic blast
Will cause these walls to crash
And the mass can be exposed
To the greatest never known Grown by the desire and the fire that inspires real writers
And to all of them I ’ve shown
That when I arrive they will cheer But all the while I ’ve been here
All the while in this square Waiting for someone to hear
Or them just to lend an ear Well it do n’t matter I ’m sitting inside an empty room Alone with no one present to hear the music boom Like Beethoven or Bach without a chance to bloom
Or for Shakespeare ’s words to never be consumed I just hope that one day my work will be exhumed
To infuse with higher levels now un-pursued
And that maybe the spirit in this will surge
And turn the world into something in which I ’m heard
Verse 1 : Could you even understand
What it ’s like to be used at hand By so many men I had so much trust in you To have you turn around And sell me to pay your dues Chorus :
So why was I I not good enough And how was I So damn foolish Verse 2 : Could you even understand
And have you gone and washed your hands I ’m sure you have And now I hold my head Above a spirit dead Chorus :
So why was I I not good enough And how was I So damn foolish And where was love
When you sold me away And where was hope
When I ’m raped every day Verse 3 : I ’m not the same girl
Not the same girl Could never be the same girl
In that bright blue world And if you had to choose again Would you keep me then I bet you would n’t And would you even know my voice Would you know my face Withered and stressed to age Well I fought , and I screamed , and I ran And I bruised , and I bled And I felt an evil so cold instead Chorus :
So why was I I not good enough And how was I So damn foolish
And where was love
When you sold me away And where was hope
When I ’m raped every day Outrro :
So close your eyes And just hide from the pain
And breathe a sigh Let your thoughts drift away Away …
Intro :
When the sun fades out And the blackness shrouds
And the wolves all howl
And the stones fall loud When the fear is found And nightmares hound Will you drown in the plague that surrounds Verse 1 : Weight upon a point of pressure , watch as it implodes Wind upon a way of life , see how it erodes
Seek inside a rose to find the wilting of a soul Seize a path unknown and then you ’ll walk the world alone Now travel past the bones of prophets and warlords
Past the empty thrones and treasures of gold hoards
Past the vacant vaults of pharaohs that came before Beyond the crowns of kings once mighty and so adored
And to the top of the ancient ziggurats
To the pyramids and plots and the holy lands forgot
And drop by a place where you can find a spot
That can spot a panorama of the messages in crops
Then stop , ponder if it serves to insight Does it shed a light on the Armageddon that ’s in sight Can it aid or help excite the armies that march strong
The battle to find calm that rattles the rage on Climb on in the race to belong Hang on in the face of the harm
Move through with the pace of a charge
And resist the alarm to embrace all the wrong
Is it truth or just words in a song
Is it hope , is it fear of forgone
Am I knight , am I lowly the pawn Let it known at the sound of the gong Chorus ; This is Mayan times Revelation But I am not afraid And I wo n’t die today
So pull me under I fear no thunder Verse 2 : Who knows why their stronghold could n’t hold me at bay
Why their strength could n’t control me away
Why the drive will not decline or decay
Or why design will leave alive one today
One to prey hard in a graveyard lay
One to take charge in a Braveheart way A mournful mist to assist and portray
The tears of grown men no pen will convey Without a leader to address or sway Our losses move under and cross the raw thunder Without an angel to embrace or save
Our hope is fused into these stones that hold hundreds
And I choose to stand Though I ’m bruised and branded I refuse the noose that I ’m handed My eulogy will read : “ To Hell he ’s been and sipped their scorched gin with a sinful grin ”
Oh strange am I Strangely eyed to look calm as our worlds collide Fools can find shade thinking fate is blind
Their safety buys stakes for their purpose dies
Though worthless lives are worth less lives
My words revive and cry loud for the certain sign
Till end of days sound and the earth is dry Know this is a farewell but it ’s not goodbye Chorus
Verse 1 : Whatever takes to lay to rest all competition , I do So pray to repent that those devout forgotten will not find you Do n’t make an attempt to follow , wallow in your own discomfort Discover how to pay your respects , accept them as your brother I ’m leaving a path through trails of mud Anointing all those in pales of blood
Then focus their lives on lies
And find they ’re hopeless in eyes of mind and why We not designed , we right on time
And when we arrive we get it live Just acknowledge we on fire Nine Leaves are the set design Record time remaining nameless Formless cuz your forms are shameless
You ’ve forgotten where you ’re from And all your flaws that made you famous Threats are painless , aim this at your heart to make the pain lift Shape - shift on this track to scratch your name right off the game ’s list Plain shit I am sick of rappers Pissed cuz I ’m a sicker cracker Fire blacking out the room of places that you stage your acting
You ’ve forgotten where ’s your passion Need to ask , that ’s my infraction
Show me where your skills at and I ’ll show you how to hack and slash ‘ em Chorus : ( excerpts from a discussion on Hip Hop )
Some are being pushed through the machine And being told what to do They ’re not challenging themselves anymore
They forget about themselves as an artist
That may be how it evolved , but that ’s not necessarily how it has to be though Some do what they want to Verse 2 : I ’m backhanding the game , she aint treating us right I aint really the one but I cherish her life I blame the change on us , the same must go for me Our love is deep but I only write once a week Listen , I never held a nine besides my 9 to 9
No jail time , trust me , my life is fine I even rhyme in a suit Cuz my pursuit of happiness is to spit the truth
You lose And I do n’t gotta change up my flow It is what it is , you can ride or you do n’t You ’ll decide as I go Every line you can scope I aint losing sleep
You could live a lie but I wo n’t I aint beat money , you could talk about all your doe Man life is sweet
You could peep my gut as it grows
Hold the cheddar for the cheese
And your beef for the streets
Two sides of a coin , my point , we both eat So yes , I really gotta say this is great
You can hate on my hate so your hate ’s just the same
Do n’t be mad at me homie I paved my own lane Speaking honestly , homie you ’re a waste of a name A waste of my space man , check out my frame I ’m drained but I still speak my piece
This last piece of hate
For these you ’ll take heat Y’all wear shades in the club I ’ll rock mine on the beach Please … Chorus : ( excerpts from a discussion on Hip Hop )
It ’s a competitive sport , Hip Hop Everything is “ I , I , I ” because you have to prove that you ’re the better emcee
And of course it ’s a business Hip Hop was n’t derived from that There is this other dimension of Hip Hop
There are these songs all over the world Verse 3 : They ’ve already forgotten
How it sounds , felt the taste it Before the industry reshaped it and raped it Landscaped your face , now you ’re the Mona Lisa
You gotta do what they do or they wo n’t release ya The fans may greet ya , but you ca n’t look them in the eyes I guess your hustlin ’ features was just a disguise
Make us believe ya , at least you could try You wanna get rich lying relying on false pride
Sold your soul for the price of the gold and the ice Now you ’re a hoe with no hold and they ’re controlling your life
You were exposed to the light but prefer being dumb
The who , what , where When will you remember one
The place you ’ve begun Look what you ’ve become Succumb to what sucks for a successful sum Regrets you ’ll have some Respect you ’ll have none Cuz when it ’s all said and done you ’re one loss was the love Chorus : ( excerpts from a discussion on Hip Hop )
People are forgetting who they are , what Hip Hop culture is , and why they ’re doing it That ’s the forgotten Everybody in Hip Hop is not an artist
You ’re doing what you think people want you to do rather than who you are There ’s no innovation Verse 4 : Have you ever had the feeling of being in slow - mo The type of case that comes with a thinking of “ oh no ”
Or had a vision showing your future as so low But without a way in which you could alter or re-sow Well I ’m a bring it through like a leader that bestows A speech upon his men that ’ll heed ‘em to let go Of the artificial skin that just keeps ‘em in limbo
These seeds will bring the being intended to first grow
You ’re heading to and fro on a path that is void of pride Happy to put aside who you are on the inside
In truth I ca n’t surmise if this turned out all by design
Did you intend to play the fool or did other people decide Did managers advise you sever ties for prize
Well now your dragon slumbers while goblins are on the rise I ’m trudging through the snow while you building a man of lies I ’m speaking to your soul but it ’s greeting me with goodbyes
And now it ’s time to hide cuz I ’m wrecking your false disguise I ’m stepping through the haze with intention to bring demise
And when the rug gets pulled and the mirror brings its surprise Look into your eyes with the question of “ who am I ”
It ’s a good thing for British newspaper reader Reuben Camara that he does n’t pay taxes in Canada .
The Lancashire resident was outraged last year at the price - tag for an April summit that brought the G20 leaders to London for two days .
Billed in some quarters as the “ budget ” summit , the meeting cost an estimated $ 30 million .
“ I ’d hate to think what a full - blown summit would cost , ” Camara complained on the website of the London Daily Standard .
Come to Canada , Ruben — and do n’t forget your cheque book .
Ottawa initially allocated $ 179 million for the G8 and G20 summits — three days of talks that are now expected to set taxpayers back at least $ 1.1 billion .
Most of the money , about $ 930 million , is for security .
Last September , Pittsburgh hosted a G20 summit that resulted in no great breaches of public order but whose security - related costs totaled only about $ 12.2 million ( U.S. ) — less than 1.5 per cent of the projected costs of the summits in Toronto and Huntsville .
“ How you can get to $ 930 million is beyond my comprehension , ” said Antony Davies , an associate professor of economics at Duquesne University in Pittsburgh .
“ That seems impossibly large . ”
For the G20 gathering in Pittsburgh , organizers rented the seven - year - old David L. Lawrence Convention Center , located on the banks of the Allegheny River in the city ’s business and entertainment district .
The Toronto summit will be similarly conducted at the Metro Toronto Convention Centre .
“ They shut down the entire downtown , ” Davies said of the Pittsburgh gathering .
“ It went very well . ”
At the April , 2009 , G20 summit in London , total costs were $ 30 million ( U.S. ) , according to a research report completed this month at the University of Toronto .
Security cost $ 28.6 million .
The U of T report estimated costs for all similar international meetings going back to 1981 , in the case of the G8 .
With just one or two exceptions , the Canadian gatherings are vastly more expensive than other meetings .
Only one other G8 meeting held since 9/11 had security costs greater than $ 124 million ( U.S. ) .
That was in Japan in 2008 .
“ This really comes down to incompetence , ” fumed Liberal public safety critic Mark Holland about Canada ’s billion - dollar summits .
“ There is no justification . ”
Comparisons are tricky because accounting may differ from summit to summit , and figures for Canada may include costs not reflected in the figures for other gatherings .
Public Safety Minister Victor Toews has promised to break down the expenses after the summits .
He conceded expenses could have been reduced if the military , rather than police , had been recruited to provide the bulk of security .
“ Canadians understand that in a democracy you have the police rather than the army in the streets , ” Toews said .
“ And so these are political decisions you make . ”
According to Ward Elcock , former head of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service , summit organizers will deploy about 19,000 security personnel over the three days of meetings that begin Friday .
They will have to be fed , housed and paid considerable sums in overtime .
By comparison , about 4,000 police were on duty for last fall ’s Pittsburgh G20 meeting .
There were about 5,000 for the G20 gathering in London .
“ You ’ve got roughly five times the police force , ” said Davies in Pittsburgh .
He roughly multiplied that city ’s $ 18 million summit costs by five .
“ That takes you to about $ 80 million . ”

What about the remaining $ 800 million ?
“ Maybe someone added on an extra zero ? ” suggested Davies .
Summit expert John Kirton at the U of T , who helped produce the report on summit expenses , says the projected Canadian costs are reasonable .
He attributes them in part to the complexity of holding two meetings in two locations .
“ For the first time in world history , we ’re holding G8 and G20 summits as twins . ”
He said the estimated costs for last year ’s G20 meetings in Pittsburgh and London do not reflect the higher investment the U.S. and Britain make in day - to - day military security compared with Canada .
“ There are military bases everywhere in the United States , ” he said .
“ Americans pay for it everyday .
It ’s billed to the Pentagon . ”
Holland disagreed .
“ That could account for some tens of millions , ” he conceded .
“ But not a billion . ”
A definitive explanation for the seemingly extraordinary cost of the two Canadian meetings will probably have to await the verdict of federal Auditor - General Sheila Fraser .
At least some portion of the high costs may reflect a stark Canadian reality in the post - 9/11 world : when it comes to security , this country has little choice but to be even more vigilant , perhaps far more vigilant , than anybody else — or risk losing U.S. trust .
As for subsequent economic gains that might flow from an international summit , Davies said Pittsburgh ’s experience has not been encouraging .
“ The financial benefit appears to be negligible . ”
In a bizarre turn , the Kings are back in the Ilya Kovalchuk chase , General Manager Dean Lombardi said Wednesday morning , confirming that the sides are " re-engaged " in negotiations .
The Kings had ended their pursuit of the high - scoring left wing on Sunday after he turned down more than one offer without making a counterproposal .
He was stuck at 10 years and $ 100 million and would n't budge .
He has since budged .
Whether that 's because he could n't get those bucks from the New Jersey Devils and the KHL was looking like his only option , or because he has had a change of heart for some reason , is n't clear .
His side is supposed to deliver a counterproposal to the Kings on Wednesday .
It still might not work for the Kings because they are concerned about the average annual value and a ripple effect -- mostly with what kind of jumping - off point a big deal for Kovalchuk will create for Drew Doughty , who has one season left on his entry - level deal .
Stay tuned .
This gets stranger by the minute .

( CNN ) -- Between 14 million and 24 million Americans still lack access to broadband internet , and " immediate prospects for deployment to them are bleak , " said the U.S. Federal Communications Commission on Tuesday .
This newly pessimistic stance contradicted previous statements by the FCC , which had said that high - speed internet service was being made available to all Americans in a timely fashion .
The statement was part of a comprehensive report by the federal agency that attempts to measure the country 's progress in closing the " digital divide " that separates relatively wealthy , wired communities from less affluent , sparsely populated areas with no access to affordable broadband .
The report found disproportionately large segments of people without broadband access in rural areas of North Carolina , Texas , South Carolina , Mississippi , Arkansas , Oklahoma and Kentucky , among other states .
Tuesday 's report , the FCC 's sixth on the subject since it was mandated to do so by the Telecommunications
Act of 1996 , is " the first really credible effort " by the agency to deliver findings based on quality data , said FCC Commissioner Michael J. Copps .
" The sixth time is the charm , " he added .
" The documented failure to connect millions upon millions of Americans disproves previous FCC findings that broadband is being reasonably and timely deployed . "
While the adoption of broadband has grown " significantly " over the last decade , " we still have a long way to go to ensure that all Americans have broadband access , " Copps said .
High - speed internet providers have said it is not economically feasible for them to install broadband in areas with few potential subscribers .
The FCC supports the growth of broadband through public - private partnerships .
In a " National Broadband Plan " announced in March , the agency said it hopes to use educational programs and an expansion of internet infrastructure to give 90 percent of Americans high - speed web access at home by 2020 .
Currently , about 65 percent of Americans have high - speed internet access at home , which the FCC says is a detriment to economic growth .
The FCC also wants to speed overall connections , which are often criticized as slow by global standards .
" Broadband is critical 21st century infrastructure , to which every American household and small business must have access to maximize our nation 's economic growth , catalyze investment , spur job creation , and ensure our global competitiveness , " said FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski .
The FCC report also updates a key standard -- the speed used to determine whether households are served by broadband .
The standard shifts from 200 kilobits per second downstream , a standard set over a decade ago when web pages were largely text - based , to 4 megabits per second downstream , a minimum generally required for using today 's video - rich applications and services .
Research into grammar by academics at Northumbria University suggests that a significant proportion of native English speakers are unable to understand some basic sentences .
The findings -- which undermine the assumption that all speakers have a core ability to use grammatical cues -- could have significant implications for education , communication and linguistic theory .
The research , conducted by Dr Ewa Dabrowska , showed that basic elements of core English grammar had not been mastered by some native speakers .
The project assumed that every adult native speaker of English would be able to understand the meaning of the sentence :
" The soldier was hit by the sailor . "
Dr Dabrowska and research student James Street then tested a range of adults , some of whom were postgraduate students , and others who had left school at the age of 16 .
All participants were asked to identify the meaning of a number of simple active and passive sentences , as well as sentences which contained the universal qualifier " every . "
As the test progressed , the two groups performed very differently .
A high proportion of those who had left school at 16 began to make mistakes .
Some speakers were not able to perform any better than chance , scoring no better than if they had been guessing .

Dr Dabrowska comments : " These findings are ground breaking , because for decades the theoretical and educational consensus has been solid .
Regardless of educational attainment or dialect we are all supposed to be equally good at grammar , in the sense of being able to use grammatical cues to understand the meaning of sentences .
" Of course some people are more literate , with a larger vocabulary and greater exposure to highly complex literary constructions .
Nevertheless , at a fundamental level , everyone in a linguistic community is supposed to share the same core grammar , in the same way that given normal development we can all walk . "
The supposition that everyone in a linguistic community shares the same grammar is a central tenet of Noam Chomsky 's theory of universal grammar .
The theory assumes that all children learn language equally well and that there must therefore be an underlying common structure to all languages that is somehow " hard - wired " into the brain .
Dr Dabrowska has examined other explanations for her findings , such as limitations to working memory , and even so - called " test wiseness , " but she concluded that these non-linguistic factors are irrelevant .
She also stressed that the findings have nothing to do with intelligence .
Participants with low levels of educational attainment were given instruction following the tests , and they were able to learn the constructions very quickly .
She speculates that this could be because their attention was not drawn to sentence construction by parents or teachers when they were children .

She adds : " Our results show that a proportion of people with low educational attainment make errors with understanding the passive , and it appears that this and other important areas of core grammar may not be fully mastered by some speakers , even by adulthood .
" These findings could have a number of implications .
" If a significant proportion of the population does not understand passive sentences , then notices and other forms of written information may have to be rewritten and literacy strategies changed .
" What 's more , the existence of substantial individual differences in native language attainment is highly problematic for one of the most widely accepted arguments for an innate universal grammar : the assumed ' fact ' that all native speakers of a language converge on essentially the same grammar .
Our research shows that they do n't . "
Dr Dabrowska presented her findings in a keynote lecture at the UK Cognitive Linguistics Association Conference on July 7 .

SPD Expands Public Services to Online Reporting
This morning , the Seattle Police Department launched an online program that allows residents to report select low - priority crimes immediately , without having to call 911 and wait for an officer to respond and fill out a police report .

Call me .
Or not .
Whatever .
" On busy nights , people often get upset that it takes a couple hours to respond to a low - level theft whenfor insurance purposes , " explains Detective Mark Jamieson .
" If someone steals your stuff and the suspect is still there , it 's best to call 911 .
But if you wake up in the morning and notice that your lawn mower is gone and there 's no physical evidence , this is an option . "
The new Community Online Reporting Program ( CORP ) is a tool for reporting property destruction , car prowls , low - level property theft , and identity theft .
The system allows you to submit a report , get a General Offense ( GO ) number as if an officer had come out , and then immediately print a copy for your records .
Once submitted , a police supervisor reviews your report for missing information ( in which case you 'll be contacted ) .
Then the supervisor signs off and the report goes into the system .
Using your GO number , you can call the department for updates on the investigation .
While the online program is new for Seattle , Jamieson says the system has been widely used in California and in other cities since 2005 and by all accounts , " the public loves it .
It empowers people .
Cities using this system have seen a decrease in the number of calls for these types of crimes . "
Still , Jamieson says , it 's not for everyone .
" There are people who do n't have access to computers and other people who like the sense of security they get from interacting with an officer — and those people are still welcome to call us .
We 're not trying to replace anything , we 're trying to give people more options .
So for people who want to use this system , it 's now available . "
Now that California ’s billion - dollar " medical marijuana ” industry and its affiliated “ recommendationists ” have made marijuana legally available to any Californian with $ 75 and the willingness to tell a doctor that he sometimes has trouble sleeping , why not go all the way and just legalize the stuff for recreational use as proposed in Proposition 19 on the November ballot ?
Then we could tax it and regulate it , eliminating the illicit market and the need for law enforcement against pot growers .
California would make a ton of money to help dig out of its fiscal hole , right ?
Well , actually , no .
There ’s one problem with legalizing , taxing and regulating cannabis at the state level :
It ca n’t be done .
The federal Controlled Substances
Act makes it a felony to grow or sell cannabis .
California can repeal its own marijuana laws , leaving enforcement to the feds .
But it ca n’t legalize a federal felony .
Therefore , any grower or seller paying California taxes on marijuana sales or filing pot-related California regulatory paperwork would be confessing , in writing , to multiple federal crimes .
And that wo n’t happen .
True , Atty .
Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr. has announced that the Justice Department will not prosecute people who are selling medical marijuana in compliance with California ’s law .
But that ’s an entirely different matter .
The attorney general could cite good legal and constitutional reasons for that policy , because the regulation of medical practice is a state and not a federal responsibility .
And if the medical justification for most of the pot sold through dispensaries is sketchy at best ?
Well , that too is a state problem .
The international treaties that require their signatories , including the United States , to ban the production and sale of cannabis have an exception for medical use .
Most important , the feds can afford to take a laid - back attitude toward California ’s medical marijuana trade because it ’s unlikely to cause much of a trafficking problem in the rest of the country .
Because dispensaries ’ prices are just as high as those for black - market marijuana , there ’s not much temptation to buy the “ medical ” sort in California and resell it out of state .
By contrast , the non-medical cannabis industry that would be allowed if Proposition 19 passed would quickly fuel a national illicit market .
According to a study issued by the RAND Corp .'s Drug Policy Research Center this month , if the initiative passes , the pretax retail price of high - grade sinsemilla marijuana sold legally in California is likely to drop to under $ 40 per ounce , compared with current illicit - market ( or dispensary ) prices of $ 300 an ounce and more .
Yes , the counties would have authority to tax the product , but even at a tax rate of $ 50 an ounce — more than 100 % of the pretax price — the legal California product would still be a screaming bargain by national standards , at less than one - third of current black - market prices .
As a result , pot dealers nationwide — and from Canada , for that matter — would flock to California to stock up .
There ’s no way on earth the federal government is going to tolerate that .
Instead , we ’d see massive federal busts of California growers and retail dealers , no matter how legal their activity was under state law .
Even without the magnet effect of cheap drugs here , the feds coul n’t afford to simply ignore a state ’s flouting of the federal prohibition on marijuana .
For one thing , allowing Californians to openly grow cannabis for non-medical purposes would be a clear violation of international law ; that ’s why the Netherlands , which tolerates retail cannabis sales through “ coffee shops , ” still bans marijuana production .
As the Dutch say , the front door of the coffee - shop trade may be legal , but the back door is illegal .
So , then , should marijuana be kept strictly illicit throughout the United States ?
Not necessarily .
Legalizing cannabis is n’t a terrible idea , but I ’d very much prefer to do it on a non-commercial ( grow - your - own or consumers ’ co-op ) basis rather than creating a multibillion - dollar industry full of profit - driven firms trying to encourage as much cannabis use as possible .
The only way to sell a lot of pot is to create a lot of potheads — not casual , moderate recreational users but chronic , multiple - joints - per - day zonkers .
( The alcohol industry , for example , gets 80 % of its income from people with drinking problems . )
A grow - your - own or co-op system would prevent that marketing push .
In any case , whenever and however we legalize the Demon Weed , it ’s going to have to be at the national level ( which includes modifying the anti-drug treaties ) rather than state by state .
Any other approach is a pipe dream .

The Influences of ' Inception '
As a cinema enthusiast who grew up enamored of directors from Nicholas Roeg to George Lucas , Christopher Nolan said , “ I ’m mindful of the great filmmakers I carry with me . ”
That mélange of influences manifests itself in many ways in “ Inception . ”
But as with any dream , who ’s to say exactly where it came from ?
“ Who knows ? ” Mr. Nolan said .
“ These things are n’t always conscious .
Sometimes these things are suggested to you , and afterwards you go : ‘ Oh , yeah .
Maybe he ’s got a point . ’
I try not to be conscious in my influences .
I try and just do what feels right . ”
Here , at least , are a few of the filmmakers he knowingly drew upon for “ Inception . ”

In a statement , his office in Rome said : “ On Monday June 28 , the prime minister , accompanied by members of his staff and numerous security agents , participated , at the invitation of a businessman , in one of the receptions held on the occasion of his visit to Brazil .
Why do n't we just detonate a nuclear bomb on the Macondo oil well , and seal the Deepwater Horizon spill that way ?
I keep hearing this suggestion in comments here and in conversations out in the real world .
Frankly , whether it 's plausible or not , that tactic is n't ever likely to get an OK .
But a few good stories have been written about the nuclear option recently and , for the sake of armchair speculation , there 's a couple of facts we should keep in mind :
Nuclear bombs have been used to seal leaking wells before , but the situations are n't analogous .
Those successful detonations were used on leaking gas wells , located on dry land .
If tactics that can stop a surface gas leak could naturally be applied to deepwater oil leaks with a high chance of success … well , we 'd probably have this thing stopped already .
The explosion would happen deep under the seabed .
Nobody 's talking about just detonating a bomb underwater .
Instead , the idea is to drill a hole near the broken well and drop a bomb down that .
The goal of an explosion is n't to cap the top of the well , but to pinch it off further down .
This fact matters , because underground detonations are much less of a threat — from a radioactive fallout perspective .
Consider the source .
Who are the most public proponents of nuking the oil spill ?
Mostly aging engineers from the U.S. and Russia who were part of 1960s efforts to use nuclear bombs in peaceful ways — like blasting through mountains to make highways , and quickly " digging " huge canals .
The U.S. scrapped its plans for nuclear - assisted infrastructure development because of concerns over the rather obvious ecological impacts of surface explosions .
( I like to imagine scientists waking up in the morning with a horrible hangover , looking at their notes from the night before , and making a bunch of frantically apologetic phone calls . )
The Soviet Union , on the other hand , had no such qualms .
They nuked their own country peacefully at least 124 times between 1958 and 1989 .
Almost every instance is described as a success , but , as you might expect , outside sources say that the full truth has n't really been reported .

CEO Eric Schmidt 's connections have given the company access to the inner circles of D.C. | Reuters Photo Google search : Political power
Google ’s aggressive tactics have put it on top of the business world , and now the Internet giant is looking to leverage the high profile and sterling connections of its CEO to achieve similar power in the political sphere .
Google boss Eric Schmidt is one of the nation ’s most politically active business leaders — a man who uses the cachet of the company he leads , as well as his own charisma , to build strategic alliances in the Obama administration and on Capitol Hill .
Advertisement
Schmidt , 55 , grew up in Washington and returns frequently to visit his mother , who still lives in Northern Virginia .
Those trips often double as chances to meet with President Barack Obama , chat with staffers at the Federal Communications Commission and meet with top lawmakers .
Schmidt ’s newly formed friendships in town have helped transform Google from a D.C. outsider into an Obama administration darling with growing clout in policy circles .
But the company ’s increasing influence is at risk of a Washington backlash from politicians and competitors , some of whom said Google ’s vast reach is raising privacy , antitrust and other concerns .
“ I ’ve been concerned about Google ’s role in the political system because they ’ve learned how to lobby very effectively ” using both traditional and nontraditional means , said Marc Rotenberg , executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center .
“ When the attention turns to them , it ’s really remarkable the influence that they have . ”
Schmidt has worked to forge relationships with a number of key members of Congress , giving generously to their campaigns and attending their fundraisers .
He recently hosted fundraisers for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) and Sens. Mark Warner ( D - Va. ) and Orrin Hatch ( R - Utah ) .
In June , Google hosted a National Republican Senatorial Committee fundraiser for Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R - Ky. ) and Sen. Mike Enzi ( R - Wyo . ) .
This year , he ’s written $ 4,800 checks to both Senate Democrats from New York , Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand .
New York , of course , is the center of the advertising industry , which is now inexorably tied to Google ’s dominant online ad platform .
In 2009 , Schmidt gave $ 1,000 each to Reps. John Garamendi ( D - Calif. ) and Bob Goodlatte ( R - Va. ) and $ 2,400 to Rep. Anna Eshoo ( D - Calif. ) , whose district includes Google ’s Mountain View headquarters .
And Schmidt wrote $ 10,000 checks to both the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and the National Republican Senatorial Committee .
Altogether , Schmidt has made $ 34,000 in personal donations for the 2010 elections , compared with $ 60,200 during the 2008 election cycle , according to the Center for Responsive Politics .
It is not uncommon for the CEOs of high - profile companies to develop ties in Washington to benefit their business , and Schmidt is certainly not the only one in the tech and telecom industries to do so .
Verizon CEO
Ivan Seidenberg leads the influential Business Roundtable and frequently gets an audience with the president , for instance .
Just last month , Comcast CEO Brian Roberts , who is trying to get approval for his $ 30 billion acquisition of NBC Universal , had lunch with Obama at the White House .
Cisco CEO John Chambers and Oracle CEO Larry Ellison have already surpassed Schmidt in political giving this cycle .
Google critics and supporters agreed that Schmidt has been especially savvy at gaining a seat at the table for some of the most important policy discussions not only for his industry but for the entire U.S. economy .
In fact , Google has become such a powerful player in the political and business worlds that most people contacted for this story refused to speak on the record about their concerns .
Unlike Microsoft and some other technology companies , Google did not go through a long period in which it treated Washington with disdain .
The company quickly saw opportunities in Washington and has steadily beefed up its presence in the city , more than doubling its lobbying spending over the past three years .
But even lawmakers who have been beneficiaries of Schmidt ’s political generosity have started to cast a skeptical eye in Google ’s direction .
Rep. Ed Markey ( D - Mass. ) , a senior member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee , which has jurisdiction over the Internet industry , recently sent a letter to Schmidt , reprimanding Google for accidentally harvesting data from private Wi -Fi networks .
The committee ’s chairman and ranking member — Reps. Henry Waxman ( D - Calif. ) and Joe Barton ( R - Texas ) , respectively — asked the Federal Trade Commission to look into the matter .
Google ’s privacy blunder also became a campaign issue for Richard Blumenthal , the Connecticut attorney general who is running for Sen.
Chris Dodd ’s seat .
He ’s now leading a 30 - state probe into the matter .
Competitors worry that the strategic roles Schmidt and a coterie of ex-Googlers play within the administration and Congress could heavily influence policies to benefit the company ’s ambitions — even though the company insists that Schmidt ’s political giving is purely personal .
“ There ’s a bit of schizophrenia going on here , ” said a Silicon Valley insider who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he does business with Google .
“ On one hand , he ’s professing personal political commitment , and on the other , he has a responsibility and mandate to push forward his own company ’s ambitious agenda .
It ’s impossible to separate the two .
For many firms out here who will be competitors to Google , these are concerns . ”
Competitors noted that Schumer , a recipient of Schmidt ’s campaign contributions , led a group of senators in sharply criticizing Facebook for mishandling users ’ personal information — but did n’t comment when Google ’s Wi -Fi snafu surfaced .
Executives at carriers like Verizon and AT&T are nervous about Schmidt ’s relationship with FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski — who , like Schmidt , has been a close adviser and friend to the president .
One of Schmidt ’s last official meetings with Genachowski was in October , according to agency records .
Schmidt “ expressed his appreciation to the chairman for his leadership in promoting open and robust access to the Internet . ”
Three weeks later , Genachowski formally announced his plan to codify Net neutrality regulations .
Google declined to comment for this story , but some observers said it is n’t surprising that the company and the administration have common values .
Democrats have traditionally been more interested in technology start - ups , while Republicans have typically been more friendly to telecom carriers , “ so the tight relationship is partly based on shared policy views and is enhanced by Schmidt ’s own proactive work with the administration , ” said Paul Gallant , a telecom analyst at Concept Capital ’s Washington Research Group .
“ If you look at Google ’s donations and the flow of personnel from his company to the administration , as well as his personal involvement , Schmidt is certainly one of the bigger players , ” Gallant said .
Google ’s political action committee spending jumped significantly with the 2008 campaign , going from $ 37,000 in 2006 , its first year in existence , to $ 289,000 at the end of 2008 .
As of March 31 , the PAC had spent about $ 183,000 , consistently giving around 60 percent of its funds to Democrats .
Schmidt ’s political interests date back to his days as an executive of Sun Microsystems and Novell in the 1990s .
But it was Schmidt ’s vigorous support of Obama ’s presidential run that started to get attention .
During the 2008 campaign , Schmidt served as an informal economic adviser to Obama and actively stumped for the candidate , who was the first to visit Google ’s headquarters , in 2007 .
After the election , Schmidt and other Google executives paid $ 25,000 each to help pay for a lavish , star - studded inaugural celebration .
Schmidt was then appointed to Obama ’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology , as was Microsoft Chief Strategy Officer Craig Mundie , and became an advocate of the $ 787 billion stimulus package .
Four Google employees went to work in the administration .
Andrew McLaughlin , former head of Google ’s global public policy , is now White House deputy chief technology officer for Internet policy — an issue in which Google has a significant stake .
McLaughlin came under fire for continuing to converse with former colleagues about policy issues such as Net neutrality .
When Obama released a memorandum directing agencies and companies to free up a wide swath of airwaves for wireless broadband services last month , Larry Summers , head of the White House economic team , gave a high - profile speech at the New America Foundation .
Schmidt is the chairman of the New America Foundation — a detail not lost on critics , who point out that Google , which makes a fast - growing mobile operating system and provides 70 percent of the mobile advertising in the U.S. , stands to gain from bigger , faster wireless networks .
“ He ’s a technologist , but he also understands the head - of - state role of a CEO , ” a D.C. tech industry lobbyist said of Schmidt .
“ He ’s rare among CEOs in that he really understands how Washington works . ”
A random walk through Seattle with my point - and - click
A few months back , my car was threatening to be difficult .
It had n’t really acted up , but the “ check engine ” light kept going off , and it struck me that I wish everything in life were kind enough to inform you of its impending break down .
In a panic , I brought my car into a repair shop .
I have no idea what they did , or what was wrong with my vehicle in the first place .
They ended up charging me $ 300 , and I am okay with that being the price of my ignorance .
It also required me to get home from Fremont without a car .
Since I figured I ’d be doing a lot of walking and taking multiple buses ( some of which had me sitting next to nose - picking guy – we ’ll later explore why this always happens ) I decided to take my point - and - click with me .
Now , I rarely have my point - and - click on me .
I generally travel with my huge Canon EOS , which I barely know how to use ( also , for the record , I do n’t know what EOS stands for .
Please do n’t tell me .
I like mystery ) .
Its size often causes me to leave it at home ( make up your own joke ) .
This time , though , I thought ahead , had my tiny camera on hand , and took photos of my walk through Fremont …

Many years ago , the Rainier Brewery was located in south Seattle and a huge red “ R ” sat atop it .
It produced horrible beer .
It eventually closed down , and everyone was duly devastated – we , apparently , loved our crappy beer ( you can still find it , but it ’s made by a different brewer ) .
The huge red R was removed and sent to the Museum of History and Industry .
The brewery turned into Tully ’s coffee headquarters , and the giant red R was replaced with a big green T .
My cousin describes that as the day Seattle died .
This giant red “ R ” in Fremont is a replica of the beloved Rainier logo .
It makes me a little sad to see it …
–
I also spotted this sign in downtown Fremont .
I absolutely loved it , because you ’ll note the restricted hours are only during the daytime .
Translation : if you want to loiter at night and sleep on the sidewalk , we wo n’t harass you .
Way to go , Seattle , by not picking on the homeless .
–
I was able to catch a bus from Fremont back to the U - district , during which I managed to sit next to a man so enthusiastically picking his nose , you ’d have thought he was paid by - the - booger .
This always happens to me .
I ’m trying to figure out ways around it but have yet to discover any ( if I ’m the crazy person picking my nose , then I wo n’t end up sitting next to another crazy person , right ? ) .
Having hopped onto the next available bus , and not really sure where it was headed , I ended up underneath the bridge I needed to be crossing .
It was n’t a total loss , since I discovered a graveyard of wrecking balls …
–
–
Near the collection of wrecking balls , and underneath the University bridge is the Wall of Death .
I struggle to explain it , so I ’ll simply leave it up to the folks at the Seattle Weekly , who do a superb job .
–
Not far away I noticed this mural .
I have never seen it before in my life .
It was kind of a nice realization , since even potholes and panhandlers become familiar in your hometown …
–
As I walked , I encountered this little guy .
–
I left him where he was on the sidewalk .
I assume someone else came by and took him , because a few days later , he was n’t there .
And , that was it , really .
I eventually made it home , though I ended up walking further , and taking more time , than I had intended .
Still , it was nice .
I got to see parts of the city I usually do n’t notice .
Things I tend to simply pass by without a second thought .
I highly recommend it .

GAZA ( Reuters ) - Israel is easing its Gaza embargo to allow snack food and drinks into the Palestinian enclave , Palestinian officials said Wednesday , following an international outcry over Israel ’s raid on an aid flotilla .

Hamas , the Islamist group that rules the Gaza Strip , said the territory needs cement , banned by Israel and essential for reconstruction after a December 2008 - January 2009 war , not soft drinks .
An Israeli official said the new product list , announced hours before U.S. President Barack Obama hosted Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in Washington , was unrelated to Israel ’s May 31 takeover of the convoy that challenged its Gaza blockade .
The talks between Obama and Abbas were expected to focus on ways to ease the embargo , which has drawn mounting international criticism since Israeli commandos , who met violent resistance on a Turkish - flagged ship , killed nine pro-Palestinian activists .
In joint remarks , Obama said the situation in Gaza was unsustainable and Abbas repeated his call to end the blockade .
Obama said the United States was providing $ 400 million in new aid for the Palestinians .
The Palestinian officials , based in the West Bank , said that as of next week , Israel will allow a wider variety of food , such as potato crisps , biscuits , canned fruit and packaged humous , as well as soft drinks and juice , into the Gaza Strip .
“ They will send the first course .
We are waiting for the main course , ” Palestinian Economy Minister Hassan Abu Libdeh said in Ramallah .
“ We are waiting for this unjust siege to end . ”
Israel says its blockade of Gaza is necessary to choke off weapons supplies to Hamas , which is opposed to Abbas ’s peace efforts with the Jewish state .
U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates , asked Wednesday about Israel ’s policy , said Hamas has used humanitarian donations to strengthen its military capabilities in Gaza .
“ Construction materials have n’t gone for housing , they ’ve gone for bunkers , ” Gates said on the program Frost Over the World to be broadcast on Al Jazeera ’s English - language channel .
Hamas played down the impact of the new Israeli product list .
“ We have three factories that make carbonated drinks .
They say they want to allow in potato chips , but we have factories that produce more than enough to meet Gaza ’s needs , ” said Ziyad al - Zaza , economic and trade minister in Hamas ’s Gaza - based government .
“ We are looking for a true , real lifting of the blockade ... the import of raw materials for industry and construction materials for the reconstruction of Gaza , ” he said .
The United Nations says the Israeli blockade has caused a humanitarian crisis in Gaza , an allegation Israel denies .
CEMENT BAN
Israel ’s ban on cement imports into the territory has limited efforts to rebuild homes and infrastructure destroyed or damaged in a three - week war it launched in December 2008 with the stated aim of curbing cross - border rocket fire .
Israeli officials have said Hamas could use cement to build bunkers and other military installations .
Asked about the new list of Israeli - approved products , the Israeli government official said : “ Over the last six months , Israel has increased the volume of goods going into Gaza and their variety .
That policy is continuing . ”
A variety of goods comes into the Gaza Strip from neighboring Egypt via smuggling tunnels .
Egypt , which largely closed its Gaza border after the Hamas takeover , reopened the frontier indefinitely following the Israeli naval raid .
Commenting on the blockade , an Israeli security source said Israel aimed to remove all restrictions on imported food items for Gaza within a few weeks and noted that jam and several other products were approved recently .
“ This has nothing to do with the flotilla , ” the source said , making no mention of whether Israel might expand the list to include reconstruction materials .
Israeli authorities said that last week , Israel transferred 12,413 tons of humanitarian aid through Gaza border crossings .
The shipments included 994,000 liters of fuel for Gaza ’s power station , 748 tons of cooking gas and eight truckloads of medicine and medical equipment , according to an Israeli list .
For most people , beauty is what you can see on the outside .
But we ’re not most people , so please forgive us if we get excited when we heard about pictures which show off the interior components of and HTC phone .
The latest phone to show off its inner beauty is the upcoming Sprint HTC EVO 4G .
The images come courtesy of iFixit.com where you can find complete instructions on how to take apart HTC ’s latest masterpiece .
Over the years , we have disassembles out fair share of HTC phones , but it looks like HTC has been working hard at keeping their handset interiors as simple as possible .
Back in the day , it took nearly 25 different steps to remove all the components from the HTC Magician .
Compared to that , the 15 steps needed to dismantle the EVO seems like child ’s play .
Just a reminder , if you do choose to try things out on your own , your manufacturer ’s warranty from HTC will be null and void .
If your phone ’s in need of repair and you ’re still within your first year , head on over to the closest Sprint store or give HTC a call .

Having watched far too many Ted.com videos I thought it would be fun to come up with one that I might give if I had to come up with one at a moment 's notice .
I wo n't allude to the subject of the talk in the title here but it becomes obvious pretty quickly .
And now , here is the pretend Ted.com talk .
Cue the TED logo , music and applause .
-----------
Most of our communication takes place either through using our mouths in person , or our fingers when writing or typing , and when two people speak the same language this is usually enough to communicate just about everything we need .
But there 's one area of communication that we do n't seem to be interested in using , and I 've always wondered why .
Because without this ability to communicate we end up in some extremely awkward and unproductive situations .
I 'll give you a quick example .
It 's morning , you 're getting ready for work and your wife or whoever is asking you a question .
She wants to know how many people came to your speech last night .
The answer is 5000 .
And you 'd love to tell her .
The problem is that you look like this .
( Picture of guy with toothbrush in mouth , clearly unable to talk )
( Picture of guy with mouth full of toothpaste leaning back and finally managing to blurt out " Wai Ouzend " without spilling anything )
already try to use it , every day
Yes , you 're in the middle of a really good brush and you wo n't be done for another minute or two .
If you 've just started you should be able to take the brush out and just tell her , but if not , you have to make a decision .
Awkwardly sign with your hand ?
Open hand with all digits spread apart for five , then put your finger and thumb together for a circle then jut out two more times for the other two zeros in the 5000 .
Now she 's not sure though whether you meant 500 or 5000 , and trying to sign again is just confusing her .
" Do you mean five hundred or five thousand ? " she asks .
It would be great if you could just signal that you mean the latter , but you do n't know how .
You 're not done brushing either so it 's time to try a different method : take out the brush , tilt your head back a bit and try to say it as best you can .
Five thousand !
And finally it worked , you have successfully communicated the word five thousand to your wife .
That was easy though ; it was just a number .
If she wanted to know something like a person 's name , address , or anything else there would be no way you could have imparted that information without writing it down , finishing brushing your teeth , or spitting the toothpaste out and simply telling her .
So I 'll get straight to the point of this talk , and then expand on why .
I think we should all know some sign language , I believe it should be taught in schools .
We do n't need to be fluent in it , but we should all know some .
How much we should know is a subject for later .
So why should we bother taking the time to learn it ?
It would require a national or even multinational effort to create a populace capable of communicating even the most basic of concepts .
But the thing is , we .
And we fail miserably .
I 'm not talking about using one 's hands for emphasis when communicating , even though here too you can see how little the hands add to the conversation : I 'm talking about when we need to communicate something but can't use our mouth , and do n't have the time or tools to write .
Let 's look at some of the numerous examples of where this is the case .
Here 's a stretch of roadway .
Let 's say you 're in one of the cars there and you just mistakenly cut someone off .
The driver of that car is has now pulled up next to you and is glaring and now is the time to let him know that you did n't mean to cut him off .
What do you do ?
Wave and it might look like you 're making fun , make another motion with one hand and he might think you 're trying to flip him off .
What people often do here is make a kind of throwing up their hands motion complete with an " I 'm sorry , I 'm a huge idiot " face with a half smiling , half cringing type of look , in order to make sure that he knows .
Imagine if you could just make a quick sign saying " I 'm sorry " .
Or you 're driving and next to you a person pulls up and it 's someone you know .
Roll down your window !
he signals .
By the way , to signal that you make a kind of circling motion even though few cars have a manual crank to open windows anymore .
At least that sign is easy to understand .
So you lower the window and it 's kind of hard to hear .
You : HEY !
WHAT'S UP !
Your friend : HEY !
YOU ... TO THE ... ER ?
You : TO THE WHAT ?
Uh oh , the light just turned green and you both have to go .
You do n't know his phone number either , and now you 're driving next to each other at 80 kph and would like to signal something but are n't sure what to do .
Eventually he ends up turning and that 's the end of that .
If you 're lucky in a situation like this you can find a place to pull over and talk , but not always .
Way more awkward than this though is the following situation .
You 're going to work in the morning , you 're standing at this intersection .
That girl across the street is your friend you do n't know very well and you notice each other across the intersection , and it 's too late to pretend you did n't .
Now what do you do ?
To talk to her you would have to yell , meaning she still might not hear you but the people standing next to you will hear you loud and clear .
Same for the people standing near her if she wants to say something to you .
You could meet in the centre of the intersection after the light changes and then walk together a bit , but then again you do n't know her very well .
But you still know her well enough that just breezing by with a nod would n't be nice .
If only there was some way you could exchange a few greetings during the minute or so you 're waiting at the intersection .
See , the thing about relying only on voice is that it 's only useful at short distances , and even then if you do n't have a plane of glass between you and the person you want to talk to .
I once saw two deaf people hanging out together at a Starbucks , signing away .
One of them went to go outside to smoke .
She sat out front , her friend stayed inside , and they continued talking with their hands .
We can't do that .
We spend a lot of time sitting behind glass , especially in our cars , and there is no way to communicate with each other without really raising our voices .
How do you tell someone in their car that they just pulled into the wrong parking spot ?
Get close and ask them to roll down the window , or yell it .
Ever felt annoyed at not being able to talk to someone at an office or embassy because they closed the glass counter and are making every effort to ignore you ?
Well , they 'll still ignore you if you both know some sign language but at least you 'll know you 're getting your point across without having to yell , and they 'll have to avoid eye contact altogether to pretend they do n't know you 're there .
How do you get a message across to a construction worker operating on noisy machinery , your wife or friend vacuuming the house , a person at a noisy bar or concert ?
Option 1 : yell .
Option 2 : signal .
The noisy bar is one area I find to be especially puzzling .
Every day millions and millions of people go to noisy bars and try to meet people , and they often end up sounding like complete idiots when they want to impress someone they 're meeting for the first time , and yet the idea to do something about this has never taken root .
Even the most eloquent of speakers is reduced to the following in a noisy bar . ( video of noisy bar , transcript ) A : DO YOU LIKE THIS MUSIC ?
YEAH ?
ME TOO!B : WHAT?A : ME TOO!B : MY FAVOURITE BAND IS B ..*^$ ! What I 'm proposing here is not full fluency , but would n't it be nice to just be able to signal that you 'll pay for a drink ?
" Here , I 'll pay for this . "
Signal it with your hands .
The conversation at these bars in a country semi-fluent in sign language would still be mostly speech , but peppered with hand signals that actually make sense , signals that add something to the conversation instead of just useless motions .
Did that person say fifteen or fifty ?
Now you know because they habitually made a quick sign at the same time .
Instances where sign language would be a big help are nearly endless , but I 'll just give a few more .
How about giving a speech where the volume for the mic is low and those in the back can only make out about half ?
Add some signing and they 'll have a much easier time following along .
Communicating within the office : you 'd like Employee A to quickly bring you a sheet of paper , the yellow one on the desk , but he 's sitting a ways away .
It 's not important enough to phone , but the distance is still enough that yelling would be awkward .
You could wave him over , then tell him to go back to his desk and get the paper , or if you could sign you could just say " bring the yellow paper " .
Nothing easier .
Got the waitresses attention and you 'd like some water ?
She 's coming over now but she was standing right next to the water when you got her attention in the first place .
A " water please " sign straight away would have let her get it for you without having to make two trips .
Want to talk to the person in front of you in the super quiet library where everyone is studying ?
Even whispering can be heard here .
Signing though , no problem .
Building burning down and firefighters need to communicate with someone at the windowsill to tell her what to do ?
They can use a bullhorn to communicate , but she is n't having as easy a time letting them know that someone else is inside the apartment and is trapped in their room and can't get out .
If she could sign it they could understand her from just about any altitude .
And of course , want to talk to someone who is hard of hearing or completely deaf ?
No problem .
This last one would seem to be the most obvious benefit to knowing sign language , but I wanted to stress the fact that people who have perfectly fine hearing would benefit from it too .
Because the way we use sign language right now is one of two ways : either 1 ) a haphazard , awkward , extremely inaccurate guesswork kind of sign language that varies from person to person , or 2 ) a very limited set of signals such as these used by bicycle riders to show where they intend to turn .
So that 's the main point I 'd like to impart here .
Learning sign language may seem to be an exotic and unnecessary skill for most of us , but the fact is that we use it all the time , or at least we try to .
And fail miserably .
We would n't get anywhere if everyone had their own crude language or crude spoken language made up on the spot , and neither does it make sense for people to use their hands to try to communicate in the way they try to every day , when they do n't even know how .
We want to use our hands to communicate and we try all the time , but somehow we 're of the opinion that only those that can't hear need this skill .
So why not realize that we all try to use our hands to communicate all the time , and then actually learn how to do it properly ?
Thank you for your time .

At a developer 's conference this evening , the MBTA will announce plans to give access to real - time bus location data on all its bus lines by the end of the summer .
In the meantime , the T is immediately releasing data on 12 bus lines , in addition to the five already covered by its " Where 's the Bus " system .
The new routes : 1 , 4 , 15 , 22 , 23 , 28 , 32 , 57 , 66 , 71 , 73 , and 77 .
They join the 39 , 111 , 114 , 116 , and 117 routes .
Although the data is public , it 's not in a human readable form .
Over the past year or so , the T has worked with local application developers to build a variety of applications that people can use on everything from smart phones to electronic signboards .
Also , MBTA General Manager Richard Davey says he will soon go on Twitter .
THE dinosaurs went out with a bang .
Most palaeontologists agree that those creatures and much of the rest of Mesozoic life ended when the Earth collided with an asteroid or a comet 65 m years ago .
But the Mesozoic , too , began with a mass extinction .
Some 251 m years ago , the efluvia of Siberian volcanoes wiped out 95 % of life in the seas , and almost as much on the land , in an episode known as the Great Dying .
This was the end of the Permian period , and of the era of life called the Palaeozoic .
The survivors regrouped , re-evolved and turned into the Mesozoic species that led eventually to the dinosaurs , pterosaurs , ammonites and belemnites that generations of fossil hunters are familiar with .
How that regrouping happened will be the topic of a presentation by Hugo Bucher , the director of the Palaeontological Institute at the University of Zurich , at the Third International Palaeontological Congress in London on July 3rd .
According to Dr Bucher , it occurred faster than anyone had previously thought , but also stuttered on the way as the volcanic activity waxed and waned .
Until now , palaeontologists have thought the recovery took tens of millions of years — a reflection either of the profundity of the Great Dying or of the toxic desert planet that the eruptions created .
But that opinion was based on shaky data .
Most rock sequences that straddle the end of the Permian are either incomplete or hard to date .
Dr Bucher , however , has had the benefit of looking at a set of strata in southern China that were , until recently , off limits to foreign scientists .
These rocks consist of fossil - rich layers containing rapidly evolving marine organisms such as ammonites , interleaved with layers of volcanic ash .
The ash contains minerals such as zircon that can be dated precisely from the radioactive decay of some of their components .
The result is 50 reliable time - points in a section that spans 10 m years .
Previously , the only dateable layers were from the moment the Permian ended and from a subsequent volcanic event some 14 m years later .
The ages of rocks between these two were little more than guesswork .
Dr Bucher 's studies of the Chinese sections indicate two things .
First , that there was not one mass extinction at the end of the Permian , but several .
Second , the time the recovery took has been greatly overestimated .
He says that species such as ammonites and conodonts ( primitive eel - like creatures with teeth ) had recovered within 1 m years of the initial extinction .
Another , smaller episode of volcanism 2 m years later , which once again heated the planet and turned the seas acid , hammered life again — and again it recovered quickly .
Only two of 15 ammonite families survived this second extinction , says Dr Bucher , but within a million years those two had speciated into 15 , and ammonites had regained their former diversity .
There also seems to have been a third episode of environmental disruption before conditions stabilised , around 6 m years after the initial extinction , and life was left in peace to reconstruct complex ecosystems of the sort that had existed before .
Over the next 4 m years , habitats that the extinction had eradicated — reefs in the sea and forests on land — re - established themselves , albeit with entirely novel species .
To quote Voltaire , then , “ Le malheur des uns fait le bonheur des autres . ”

Mind has an excellent article on how the inflexibility of young children ’s brains can make them better learners than adults .
The piece riffs on the apparent paradox that humans develop into perhaps the most psychologically flexible of creatures and yet spend the longest with seemingly impaired mental functions .
This is due to the relatively delayed development of the frontal lobes during childhood .
One particularly delayed skill is the ability to direct our attention – to the point where young children do n’t have the flexibility to switch away from something that has grabbed their focus .
However , the article makes the point that this may be an evolutionary ‚ Äúengineering trade - off ” that actually makes children much better at learning certain rules – such as those often present in language .
To explain this , it helps to imagine you are playing a guessing game :
You have to choose one of two options , either A or B , one of which leads to a prize , and one of which does not .
After a few rounds , you notice that about three fourths of the time the prize is at A , and the rest of the time it is at B , so you decide to guess ‚ ÄúA ‚Ä ù 75 percent of the time and ‚ ÄúB ‚ Äù 25 percent of the time .
This is called probability matching , and it is the response pattern most adults tend to adopt in these circumstances .
However , if the goal is to win the most prizes , it is not the best strategy .
In fact , to maximize the number of correct predictions , you should always pick the more frequent outcome ( or , in this case , always pick ‚ ÄúA‚Äù ) .
Interestingly , if you were playing this kind of guessing game with a toddler , you would see that they would employ the maximization strategy almost immediately …
Children ‚Äôs inability to filter their learning allows them to impose order on variable , inconsistent input , and this appears to play a crucial part in the establishment of stable linguistic norms .
Studies of deaf children have shown that even when parental attempts at sign are error - prone and inconsistent , children still extract the conventions of a standard sign language from them .
Indeed , the variable patterns produced by parents who learn sign language offers insight into what might happen if children did not maximize in learning : language , as a system , would become less conventional .
What words meant and the patterns in which they were used would become more idiosyncratic and unstable , and all languages would begin to resemble pidgins .
The piece was written by researcher Melody Dye , who works in the lab where this research is being conducted .
Also , do n’t miss her article on why children have trouble acquiring color names , even far past the point when parents are confident that their pride and joy has mastered the skill .

Schwinn Bikes , owned by Dorel Industries has been upping their game for the past two or three years concerning their department store bikes .
I enjoy speaking about these bicycles because well …
I am based in West Virginia and not every person who wants to ride a bike wants to own a fifteen pound ( thousands of dollars ) road bike , or the latest mountain bike shown on bikeradar .
There has to be a middle ground between the trash sold at Wal - Mart , and the Independent Bike Dealer products .
Dorel is finally learning that mountain bikes with fifty doohickey springs , and other trash is not going to last , and if they put out a quality product , people will notice .
I ’m not a fan of Dorel , but sometimes you have to acknowledge a good product .
The Schwinn Solitaire fits this description to a T .
It comes in Male and Female versions and retails for $ 239 .
Check out the specs :
Frame : Aluminum
Fork : SR Suntour Threadless
Shimano 7spd Trigger Shifters
Generic Brakes and Levers
SR Suntour Crank
FENDERS AND RACK
Shimano Front / Rear Derailleur , and Freewheel Cassette .
Somewhat - Generic 700 C Wheels
As you can see , the false flashy aspects are there for the disposable items , while the wheels are somewhat disappointing .
I am so proud to see that they are 700c , to get away from sizing bicycles by wheel size , but the availability of tires and tubes at department / big - box stores are still somewhat scarce .
The Fenders and Rear Rack are somewhat there for decoration , but I am sure they have a functional role too .
Just do n’t expect much out of them .
The aluminum frame and SR Suntour fork is the most impressive part .
Trek , Cannondale , and several other of the large bike companies probably had their frames and forks made in the same factories as these .
No Lie .
Trek ’s 2008 Navigator 2.0 was very , very similarly specced in 2008 but started out at $ 300 - 400 .
While you are not getting a wonderful warranty and lifetime service on the bike when you buy it from a big box or department store , the $ 50 - 150 in savings may be worth the ignorance .
More than likely , you will have to do the walk of shame to a bike shop to get the wheels trued , and derailleur hangers / derailleurs correctly aligned / adjusted .
They will give you a look that will burn into your inner consciousness and make you wonder why you got the Schwinn Solitaire instead of a LBS bike , but then you forgot that you ’ll probably end up only riding it once or twice a week at max … and that is perfectly fine .
Now think about it …
This bike is more expensive than say … .
a NEXT MTN X- BIKE whatever with so much useless and outdated technology that is n’t worth the metal it was stamped out of .
While a Tourney derailleur is not the best that Shimano makes , it is most definitely more reliable than some $ 0.85 stamped metal derailleur you can find on alibaba.com .
Once again , how can you go wrong ( if you have your LBS build the bike , not Wal - Mart ) with a bike this versatile and well priced when trying to start riding a bike ?
If you have to buy a bike from Wal - Mart , use your common sense and choose something with quality , not just wacky shapes and flash .
If you see this bike at your local Wal - Mart , at least take a look at it and see that there is always an exception to the rules ; Wal - Mart can and may sell some quality bikes in - store …
I give this bike One and a Half Thumbs Up .
Let ’s play a little choose - your - own - adventure game .
Okay , ready ?
You ’re a small Russian games development studio located deep in the grassy guts of your enormous nation .
It is dark .
You are likely to be eaten by a grue .
In your inventory is : Some designers .
Some computers .
Two jars of instant coffee .
Some asshole has drunk all the milk .
You ’ve just had tremendous critical success with your first videogame , Pathologic , and the time has come for you to choose what to do next .
Do you :
A ) Pay for a stripper to come round to the studio and , in the absence of cocaine , write “ POTHOLGIC ” on her back in coffee before starting work on Pathologic 2 .
Б ) Realise it would be quite nice to earn lots of money without quite as much thought involved .
Design a truck driving sim called Hawk Angry ’s Bitchin ’ Rig Blowdown that features 12 different bitchin’ rigs and an all new Mowdown Showdown mode .
Г ) Stay entirely focused on the future .
No sequels , no cash - cows , no rest time .
Come up with an all new concept for another experimental game and get to work .
Д ) Decide that videogames are n’t the correct medium for your team ’s grim visions , go on to sell all your computers and buy two tons of surplus hospital equipment and DIY supplies .
For the next nine months nobody is seen leaving or entering your building , though the noise of welding , hammering and bestial howling continues late into every starless night .
If you chose Г you can feel smug and pour yourself a healthy shot of vodka , because that ’s exactly what Ice - Pick Lodge are doing .
This year should see the English version of their next game , Typrop ( Which translates to “ Tension “ and while due to some fist - eatingly annoying copy protection I have n’t been able to play as much of my friend ’s Russian copy as I ’d like , I have played the first couple of hours .
And oh , mercy .
Once again
The Void is a first - person game about the struggle against death , though it pulls the rug out from under you in the first couple of minutes of play .
See , you ’re already dead .
What The Void tasks you with is exploring and understanding the dark , sprawling underworld you find yourself in , communicating with the mad inhabitants , learning ( and then manipulating ) the strange new laws of nature down there , all of it with the aim of clawing your way back towards the light .
While there ’s nothing cutting edge about the engine , the design of the world is spectacular .
Barren black bluffs that tail off into nothingness , twisted islands of gravel surrounded by inky water , unnatural vast tediums of sandstone and narrow paths that curl through the air , supported by nothing .
There ’s human architecture in the game too , though it ’s slightly more sparse and even more fucked up .
Corridors are too narrow , open spaces are too open , and the only furnishing seems related to rest .
Chaise longues , cots , a bath surrounded by tinctures , a mansion cut into a stone wall decorated like an Egyptian pyramid .
As far as I can tell the two mechanics at the core of The Void are colour and the Brothers .
The colour ’s a really interesting one .
The world you ’re in is overwhelming sterile , most of it either built of stone or scorched black earth , but every so often you ’ll come across little spurts of colour contained in hungry creatures , weeds , mosses and so on .
You can absorb this colour into various parts of your body and it acts as both your health and mana , but you ’re always pushed for space .
To begin with you can only fill up your left breast and left forearm with the tiniest spurts of beige or silver , and the only use I could find was siphoning it back into dead trees and plants .
In time , however , you learn to trace sigils and spells such as using your colour to influence people and fling boulders , and more body parts become unlocked for storage .
I was surprised to find out that while I was gifting the trapped , exhausted women around the world with colour to make them talk to me ( shut up Kieron ) , certain colours are deathly poisonous to certain Sisters .
Soon after that I noticed that you can farm colour by sluicing it into dead trees then returning several days later .
The body of the tree is still be dead but the colour you choose thrives in that time , growing up along invisible branches to create glittering canopies in the sky .
Presumably by about the half way point of The Void you ’ve transformed into a terrifying , shimmering multicoloured sorcerer , twisting and bending the bleak landscape back in on itself in your quest to return on the land of the living .
But I mentioned the Brothers , did n’t I ?
The Brothers are strange and fearful men and act as peacekeepers of the afterlife , and it turns out if there ’s one thing you are absolutely , positively not meant to do as your soul rots away it ’s mess with the colour .
In time your activities draw the attention of one of the brothers , who appears on the world map as a little spherical icon who starts drifting towards you .
I ’d just learned how to stuff rocks full of colour before flinging them around as crude projectiles , so I was naturally pretty confident .
In time the Brother arrived in the same zone I was in and … the game ended .
Insta - death of my fledgling soul .
More than anything I think the reason this game excites me is it ’ll be a chance for all the people who tried Pathologic but could n’t stomach it to experience Ice - Pick ’s handiwork .
The Void might be a little obtuse and the atmosphere kinda stifling , but compared to Pathologic it ’s a full - body massage .
Discovering how the world works and winning over the Sisters is immediately rewarding , and there ’s no sense of pressure for quite a while as you wander round , get lost and experiment with colour .
There ’s a collection of fun stuff on the site if you want to whet your appetite a little more - music , screenshots , a couple of trailers and some writing from the developers .
I ’m not sure I ’d recommend any of it though .
It ’s a little early to call it , but I ’d say this is a game that ’s built around the concept of exploration .
I reckon you want to go in having seen as little as possible .
The Void will be coming to the West in 2009 .
We ’ll have an interview with Ice - Pick next week

The PM said he hoped troops would not be in Afghanistan another five years
Prime Minister David Cameron has said he wants UK troops out of Afghanistan within five years .
Speaking in Canada , Mr Cameron said he wanted to see troops home by the time of the next general election , due in 2015 , " make no mistake about it " .
However , ahead of talks with US President Barack Obama on Saturday , Mr Cameron told Sky News he preferred not to " deal in too strict timetables " .
Some 307 UK forces personnel have died since the Afghan mission began in 2001 .
Armoured vehicle
During the election campaign , Mr Cameron said he would like to see troops brought back during course of this Parliament .
Interviewed in Canada , where he will take part in the G8 and G20 summits , Mr Cameron told Sky News : " We can't be there for another five years , having been there for nine years already .
" But one thing we should be clear about - Britain should have a long - term relationship with Afghanistan , including helping to train their troops and their civil society , long after the vast bulk of troops have gone home . "
On his mind ... is the fact that June has been the bloodiest month for Nato forces in Afghanistan since the mission began in 2001 , with the coalition death toll standing at 80 .
Nick Robinson Read Nick 's thoughts in full Four killed in Afghanistan named
His aides said his comments did not suggest any new timetable for bringing troops home .
BBC political editor Nick Robinson said while there was insistence the remarks did not indicate a new policy , the prime minister 's declaration " does highlight the fact that his mind is on how and when to bring British forces out of Afghanistan " .
Mr Cameron spoke as four UK soldiers who died in an accident in Afghanistan on Wednesday - the latest British fatalities there - were named by the Ministry of Defence .
Pte Alex Isaac , Pte Douglas Halliday , Colour Sgt Martyn Horton and L / Cpl David Ramsden were travelling in a Ridgeback armoured vehicle when it left the road and landed in a canal .
' Some stability '
Mr Obama wants a US drawdown of troops to begin next summer although US General David Petraeus - who this week replaced the sacked commander of multinational forces Stanley McChrystal - is among those insisting that has to be based on conditions on the ground .
Asked about Mr Obama 's preference , Mr Cameron said he would rather not " deal in too strict timetables " but wanted to get on with bringing " some stability " in Afghanistan so its people could run their own country and troops could come home .
In an interview with Canadian broadcaster CBC , Mr Cameron added that he wanted a " proper review " of progress towards the end of the year .
" I want this to be done , as far as possible , on the basis of success rather than lines in the sand and dates , but am I pushing very hard to get everything done so this can happen ?
Yes , of course . "
He said there were three main aims - ensuring the troop surge works and counter - insurgency continues " full steam ahead " , training the Afghan army and police , and achieving the political settlement needed " with those elements of the Taliban that want to lay down their weapons " .
" Get those three things right and the timetables are realistic , " he said .
' Mission creep '
Some 10,000 British soldiers are based in Afghanistan , many fighting a counter - insurgency campaign in the southern Helmand province .
Ministers say it is crucial to Britain 's own security to ensure " a stable enough " Afghanistan to prevent it again becoming a haven for those who want to carry out attacks like 9/11 .
British troops went to Afghanistan in November 2001 as part of an American - led invasion in the wake of the 9/11 attacks in the US .
The goal was to topple the Taliban who had given safe haven to al - Qaeda , although in the following years the aims of the British mission broadened .
Last summer the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Select Committee said British troops were trying to do too much and had experienced " mission creep " .
It said the initial goal of supporting the US in countering international terrorism had stretched into the realms of " counter - insurgency , counter - narcotics , protection of human rights and state - building " .
Following a visit to the country this month Mr Cameron warned further British casualties were likely over the summer , and said he wanted to bring troops home " the moment it is safe to do so " .
He told MPs that while the threat from al - Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan had reduced - he had been advised it would increase again if international forces left .
Samir Nasri ’s delightful brace helped Arsenal on their way to a 3 - 0 win notable for the side ’s continued progress on their defensive strategy .
_______________________________________________________________________________
It was close to this time last season when Arsene Wenger hurriedly paced the touch - line against third - place Hungarian outfit Szombathelyi
Haladás , anxiously trying to knit together his changing plan for the coming season .
“ The team we have now gets there , ” he told Martin Samuel of the The Times last season .
“ At 22 or 23 I think a team is mature enough to deliver and it is a massively important year for our club .
I am conscious of that .
I know people have no patience anymore . ”
A year on and there is a much calmer looking Wenger on the Arsenal bench this time , more confident that his troops have the added experience to back up their infinite technical ability .
There are slight changes afoot as well as the 4 - 3 - 3 as played out at the end of last season looks set to be the likely formation against Liverpool on the first day of the season .
Here Jack Wilshere once again resumed his dual midfield role alongside Emmanuel Frimpong – ahead in the pecking order due to Denilson ’s injury and his greater athleticism over Craig Eastmond .
Samir Nasri was pushed a bit higher – Wenger conscious that the modern game dictates the need to play in between - the - lines and in bands so Nasri pushes closer to Chamakh in the attacking phase .
Wilshere – or the left - sided central midfielder in any case – drops back to make a two in front of the back four .
Initially there were a few problems caused by Sturm Graz .
The imbalance in the midfield meant Arsenal ’s back line had to push up to squeeze the space in front but that also afforded the Strum Graz lone forward the opportunity to break past the offside trap .
Last season we highlighted the problem in distances in Arsenal ’s had in their implementation of the pressing game and for it to work , space must be squeezed for the side to remain compact .
Of course , it can be a suicidal tactic to push up as high as Arsenal did as the Austrain opponents looked to exploit the space behind at every opportunity .
Johan Djourou in particularly , looked uncomfortable early on .
Essentially , in the defensive phase , the Gunners made a 4 - 1 - 4 - 1 and that left Frimpong isolated at times so the defence knew they had to push up to remain compact .
That is why Wenger feels it is important for the forwards to press better and the central midfielders to remain wary of the defensive assignments ; Jack Wilshere dropping back is key to the style as it allows the side to maintain their shape .
Another weakness was the side being vulnerable to the long diagonal across the left - flank because the of lopsidedness of the system meaning the formation tends to slant towards the right hand side .
Arshavin ’s lack of defensive discipline and Traore ’s tactical awareness was continually sought to be tested by Sturm Graz ’s forwards who switched sides also to exploit this gap .
Fortunately for Arsenal , their domination meant such occurrences were not as frequent as they could have been and despite issues to be ironed out , there remains much promise , especially from attack as a form of defence viewpoint .
Wilshere and Arshavin showed their growing understanding on the left and their link up play created many openings especially the space for Walcott to work on on the right .
As it was , Nasri opened the scoring with the type of burst and clinical finishing that will be expected of much next season .
Jack Wilshere was again in the action as for the second goal he won a free - kick on the edge of the box which Nasri delightfully dinked into the top - corner to give Arsenal space to relax .
Relax they did n’t however as many of the youngsters , ready to stake their claim for next season put in a perhaps more impressive performance than the first half as they hardly allowed Sturm Graz a sniff a goal .
Henri Lansbury was energetic in the box - to - box role and he finished off a good move set - up by Jay Emmanuel Thomas .
Thomas , playing as the lone stiker , was clever in his movement and although relying massively on his beastly stature , continued to create space for his team - mates .
Theo Walcott particularly enjoyed the opportunities presented to him to roam inside and Wenger will be hoping that the same ploy will add greater unpredictability to the side ( an article on that later on in the season ) .
In central - midfield Eastmond had a sightly error - strewn half but the assurances he provides to the back four is almost Sergio Busquets - like despite his limitations on the ball and he reads the game very well .
Havard Nordtviet was one of the three players to play a full game and was very astute and mobile at right - back – and it must be said his his long - passing , developed playing in defensive midfield for FC Nuremberg , were unerringly accurate .
Overall it was a promising performance for the Gunners who , thankfully it must be said , are ready to give greater attention to the defensive side of their game and despite a couple of niggles , the side did come away with a clean sheet .
The goalkeeping position is still yet to be decided and while it is an issue that needs to be sorted , it ’s still quite a simplistic view that the goalkeepers are to blame for the number of goals shipped in last season – it requires a collective effort first and foremost to deny those chances .
And that is what Arsene Wenger is looking to work on for the coming campaign .

Claim : Photograph shows a snake that burst trying to eat an alligator .
Status : Real photo ; undetermined description .
Example : [ Collected on the Internet , 2005 ]
Is this real ?
Is this real ?
Origins :
We ’re used to the idea that snakes can distend their jaws to swallow food many times the size of their own heads , but we ’re not quite used to idea that they might literally eat themselves to death trying to swallow prey too big for their own good ( and body
size ) .
That ’s supposedly what happened in the above - displayed photo taken in Florida ’s Everglades National Park on 26 September 2005 : a 13 - foot Burmese python attempted to swallow a 6 - foot American alligator , resulting in both animals ’ being found dead with the gator ’s hind end protruding from the snake ’s burst midsection .
Explanations claimed the python stretched too far trying to swallow the alligator , or the gator clawed a hole in the python with its back legs as the snake attempted to ingest it .
Given that the head of the python was missing ( and apparently nowhere to be found ) , a possible alternative explanation is that the python ate an alligator ( possibly an already - dead one it came across ) , and some other agent — probably human — killed the snake , chopped off its head , and cut open its midsection , exposing the as - yet undigested gator .
Another theory is that the rotting gator meat inside the python caused a build - up of gases which ruptured the snake ’s body , and after the python died its head sank into the water , where it was eaten by scavengers .
( Some pundits have even maintained that the snake was killed by a second alligator , which then ate the serpent ’s head . )
Three other gator - python encounters had been documented in the previous three years , all of which ended with the gator ’s successfully escaping from or killing its serpentine attacker .

Fugazi have revealed plans to put hundreds of their concerts online , helping thousands of fans to recall their favourite mosh - pit bruises .
The legendary 1990s punk band will launch an internet archive featuring " almost every show " they ever played .
" We are not that far away from being able to set up our own website where ultimately almost every show we ever played will be available for download , " guitarist Guy Picciotto recently told fansite World of Fugazi ( via Twentyfourbit ) .
The Washington , DC band , revered by the DIY and post - hardcore scenes , toured the world from 1987 until 2002 .
Although bootlegs of their shows have been traded on tape , CD and now MP3 , Fugazi have only previously issued 30 live recordings , as part of their Fugazi Live Series CD - Rs .
These included concerts in New York , Hong Kong and London .
According to Picciotto , Dischord Records is still busy converting the stack of bootlegs to a digital format and preparing the " infrastructure " of the project website .
The recordings will probably be released a few at a time , beginning later this year .
The archive 's official announcement , still forthcoming from Dischord , could be an opportunity for an even bigger announcement – say , a Fugazi reunion .
Despite an eight - year hiatus , the band have never officially broken up .
Musically , Picciotto has been busy over the past two years , working with the late Vic Chesnutt .

Just to pick one : if we actually were a right - of - center nation , Social Security would not be the immortal sacred cow it is now .
Right - of - center elected officials would have long ago done away with this safety net .
A right - of - center nation would have never embraced the extremely liberal notion of public retirement insurance for its citizens .
And government - funded health care for seniors like Medicare ?!
That ’s not “ free market ” – that ’s not “ freedom . ”
If we were a right - of - center nation , you could win an election by saying you planned to eliminate Medicare and Social Security .
After all , this would be an effortless way of leaving the unprecedentedly bloated defense budget intact while still cutting big “ gubment . ”
Instead such a proposal is grounds for getting you burned in effigy .
Even in 2005 , President George W. Bush with his Republican majority in the infamously lazy , never - in - session 109th Congress could n’t “ privatize ” Social Security .
A right - of - center nation would have not only embraced the proposal , but also stood up and collectively swelled with pride that when they retire , they ’ll be on their own !
“ The government will get off my back about only being able to afford to eat cat food ! ” Liberty !
This “ right - of - center nation ” sound bite is useful to Republicans because it is a means of getting their way while still seeming as if they ’re negotiating .
It ’s actually very clever on their part .
If you want to sell an item for $ 100 , price it at $ 150 and let someone talk you down to the price you really want .
The buyer feels good about his power of persuasion , and you feel good about controlling the final price .
The sound bite frames the debate to move liberalism to the outskirts of the conversation .
The left side becomes the outlier – the spectrum of the debate is then between the conservative far - right and the conservative right - of - center .
It ’s reminiscent of the Henry Ford quip about the Model T , “ You can have any color you want as long as it ’s black . ”
The reality : the majority of Americans are actually progressive whether or not they call themselves that .
Poll after poll finds when Americans are asked how they feel about issues like the minimum wage , protecting the environment , gay rights and even gun control – the majority agrees with the Left .
And no , “ a majority ” is n’t two - thirds or 60 % .
A majority still means more than half unless you ’re in the U.S. Senate .
Progressives believe the future will be better .
The whole idea of America is progressive .
It ’s a new country founded on idealism and unalienable rights .
America was an idea so progressive that even now as the U.S. Constitution is the oldest currently in use it still seems radical .
We believe in equality .
We believe in government protections of individual rights .
We believe in the right of due process .
We believe the government is best run by and for the people .
We are not and have never been a conservative country .
According to Forbes , we have more millionaires than any other country in the world , and progress is about prosperity .
Listen to Republicans and they ’ll try to sell you on business being only right - wing .
Innovation is n’t partisan .
Our country ’s biggest export is the union - packed liberal staple of Hollywood entertainment .
Job -creating venture capitalists like Warren Buffett are also progressive .
Venture capitalism – investing to improve the world through new ideas – is the definition of progressive .
Ditto Silicon Valley .
The richest man in the world , Bill Gates , is nowhere near conservative .
Saying liberals are anti-business is like saying conservatives are anti-border control .
Are we a right - center nation ?
No .
First off , it ’s a false premise .
We have to be a center - center nation .
The consensus is the center .
And the center voted for Democratic majorities in the House , Senate and White House .
So when a minority of 40 senators hold up unemployment insurance because mid-January of last year they inexplicably became worried about spending are the same 40 who tout continuing tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans – it has nothing to do with “ center right . ”
It ’s center not right .

Die beiden öffentlich - rechtlichen Mainstreamprogramme sind nicht besser als Privatsender , verbrauchen aber mehr Geld
ARD und ZDF übertragen 55 Spiele der Fußball - Weltmeisterschaft 2010 , der britische Sender Sky alle 64 .
Die beiden öffentlich - rechtlichen Sender schickten dafür 550 Mitarbeiter nach Südafrika , das Murdoch - Unternehmen lediglich 70 .
Ist nun die Berichterstattung von ARD und ZDF acht Mal besser als die von Sky ?
Im direkten Vergleich gibt es bisher nichts , was darauf hindeuten würde .
Die weitverbreitete Auffassung , ARD und ZDF müssten mehr Qualität liefern als die Privatsender , scheint sich vor allem auf drei Missverständnissen zu gründen :
Das erste davon ist , dass hier eine Vorstellung von tatsächlich besserem Fernsehen aus einer lange abgeschlossenen Vergangenheit nachwirkt , das zweite , dass anspruchsvolle öffentlich - rechtliche Spartensender auf das Image von ARD und ZDF abfärben und das dritte , dass alles , was teuer und werbeeingeschränkt zur Verfügung gestellt wird , ja irgendwie besser sein " muss " .
Tatsächlich sind sich die großen deutschen TV - Sender nicht nur bei den Formaten , sondern auch bei der Auswahl , Darstellung und Bewertung von Nachrichtenereignissen bemerkenswert ähnlich : Qualitätsunterschiede zwischen öffentlich - rechtlichem und privatem Fernsehen gibt es zwar bei einzelnen Sendungen , aber keineswegs mehr grundsätzlich .
Wenn man lange genug sucht , dann findet man bei fast jedem Sender ( außer bei 9 Live ) irgendetwas Gutes : Bei ProSieben die Simpsons , bei Kabel1 Raumschiff Enterprise , bei RTL Dr. House , bei RTL2 Rom , etc .
Auch auf öffentlich - rechtlichen Sendern gibt es diese Ausnahmen - zum Beispiel Plusminus , ein Magazin , das zeitweise durch wirklich staatsferne ( und mittlerweile bezeichnenderweise aus dem Internet - Archiv gelöschte ) Beiträge zum Euro und zum Denkmalschutz auffiel .
Zusammengerechnet hat in diesem Bereich aber trotzdem der Ex-Kanzler Gerhard Schröder recht :
Er fasste die " Glotze " nämlich nur als ein Medium zusammen , während er Bild und BamS trennte .
Aber auch der Deutschlandradio- Intendant Ernst Elitz schlug im Tagesspiegel vor , man solle " den ganzen Brei aus Volksbelustigung , Sport und Schmusetalk als Dauerwerbefläche deklarieren " .
Mittlerweile spricht sogar die Bild - Zeitung - zwar aus dem Glashaus heraus , aber keineswegs zu Unrecht - vom " Doof - TV " .
Und das Bildblog erweiterte im letzten Jahr den Radius der von dem Portal kritisierten Medien .
Ein vernünftiger und nachvollziehbarer Schritt .
Denn was inhaltliche Probleme betrifft , ist schon lange kein wirklicher Unterschied mehr zwischen Bild und anderen Mainstreammedien festzustellen .
Nonsens - Neologismen und Radaubegriffe wie " Raubkopierer " , " Killerspiele " und " geistiges Eigentum " kommen im Spiegel und in anderen Mainstreammedien mindestens genau so häufig vor .
Das gilt auch und vor allem für das ZDF , das gerne im Rahmen der Loblieder für einen angeblich unabhängigen und qualitativ besseren öffentlich - rechtlichen Rundfunk pauschal und unverdient mitgelobt wird .
Dass der Kanal höchstens neben , eher aber unter dem Niveau der großen Privatsender operiert , zeigte unter anderem die Sendung " Generation Porno " aus der Reihe " 37° " : Untertitel : " Wie Kinder hartem Sex begegnen " .
" Das Thema Gewalt sei vom Thema Pornografie gar nicht zu trennen " durfte da beispielsweise eine kamera***** 1 Mutter ohne nähere Begründung küchensoziologisieren .
Allerdings unterschied sich das , was die Mutter sagte , nicht wesentlich von dem , was sich das ZDF - Produktionsteam an Formulierungen ausdachte :
" Auch auf seinem Handy " , heißt es da beispielsweise , " hat Kristian Fotos von nackten Frauen - aus dem Internet heruntergeladen . "
Und in seinem Zimmer wird ein " Poster mit halbnackten Frauen " und ein " Foto von ' Frauenarzt ' , auf dem der Rapper eine nackte Frau betatscht " bemängelt .
Gerade Letzteres zeigt , dass hier etwas ganz Normales skandalisiert wird , was jeder 14 - jährige macht .
Den Rapper Frauenarzt hören zum Beispiel , der genau besehen auch nichts anderes als der Fips Asmussen oder der Rudi Carrell der Gegenwart ist .
Die " Dokumentation " war selbst nichts anderes als besonders perfide Pornografie : 14 - Jährige , die zwar offenbar hormonell und kulturell soweit ausgereift waren , dass sie sich für solche Themen interessierten , deren Medienkompetenz aber noch derart kümmerlich ausgeprägt war , dass sie nicht merkten , wie sie für einen Propagandafilm bloßgestellt wurden .
So , wie sie das ZDF darstellte ( nämlich jenseits der von Nachmittagstalkshows und DSDS gesetzten Maßstäbe ) werden sie sich noch in 60 Jahren dafür schämen .
Dies bei möglicherweise vollem Bewusstsein ausgenutzt zu haben , ist in der Tat eine Form des Missbrauchs von Minderjährigen , über dessen Ahndbarkeit man nachdenken sollte .
Im Vergleich dazu ließ die Bild - Zeitung den Stiefvater eines Mädchenmörders mit einem bemerkenswerten weniger ideologisch vorgeprägten Statement zu Wort kommen .
Auf die Frage , ob es irgendetwas gab , was auf diese
Tat seines Sohnes hingedeutet hätte , antwortet der nämlich nicht mit Standards wie " Killerspielen " und Porno , sondern mit etwas , das die Medienöffentlichkeit nicht erwartet , das aber trotzdem abgedruckt wurde :
Für ihn gab es nur seine Mama .
Keine Sex - Heftchen und wenn im TV Schmuddel - Werbung mit nackten Frauen lief , hat Daniel immer weggeguckt .
Auch in der Debatte um die EU - Verfassung lieferte die Bild - Zeitung mehr Meinungsvielfalt als das deutsche Fernsehen .
Trotzdem verbot man dem Springer - Verlag eine Übernahme der ProSieben - Sat1 - Senderkette .
Die Begründung dafür war unter anderem ein von der Kommission zur Ermittlung der Konzentration im Medienbereich ( KEK ) postulierter gemeinsamer Medienmachtsanteil von 42 % für Springer und ProSiebenSat.1 .
Das dabei verwendete Modell wirkt - von den erhobenen Daten bis hin zu den Gewichtungskriterien - relativ willkürlich und lässt vor allem eine zentrale Frage unberührt :
Wo steckt eigentlich die Meinungsvielfalt , die es zu schützen gilt ?
Einer vom Mainzer Kommunikationswissenschaftler Hans Kepplinger durchgeführten Studie nach wird Fernsehen nicht selektiv nach politischer Grundhaltung genutzt .
Vielleicht liegt der Grund darin , dass beim Fernsehen eine solche selektive Nutzung gar nicht möglich ist : Denn wo ist der Unterschied zwischen Günther Jauch auf ARD und Günther Jauch auf RTL , zwischen " Explosiv " und " Brisant " , zwischen Beckmann , Kerner und Konsorten ?
Nun wollen die Ministerpräsidenten der Bundesländer dem Werbebranchenblatt Kontakter zufolge trotz einer neuen Geldflut aus der Umwandlung der geräteabhängigen Gebühr in eine " Haushaltspauschale " bei der " Überprüfung des Programmauftrags " ausgerechnet bei denjenigen Sendern " sparen " , welche ein Programm machen , das teilweise aus diesem Einheitsbrei herausragte .
Das " Erste " und das ZDF gelten dagegen als " unantastbar " .

Hardware
Apart from the three capacitive buttons ( back , menu , and home ) and a mic on the right , you 'll find four physical buttons along the top ridge -- volume rocker , power , and camera ( two - stage button i.e. press half - way to focus ) .
The 3.5 mm headphone jack is right next to the volume keys , which can be a nuisance if your headphones rock a straight plug .
Luckily , the bundled handsfree kit -- with an L - shape plug -- has pretty impressive clarity and moderate bass , plus you get three sets of rubber buds to suit your ears .
Other accessories include a USB mains adapter ( with UK and EU plugs ; the US will obviously get something else ) , USB cable ( with clip ) , and a microfiber pouch ( which doubles as a wiping cloth ) .
Disappointingly , the gorgeous HDMI dock -- due to arrive in the UK over the next two weeks -- is not included , and Dell 's still mum on pricing .
Well , at least for now we can tease the company for the artwork blunder on the box -- the illustrator somehow assumed the screen does edge to edge .
Ah , if only .
Software
Well , here 's the meat .
Like we said earlier , this final firmware performs much smoother and is more stable than what we have on our prototype .
Dell 's also put on its own skin over the Android 1.6 OS -- homescreen icons are put in shaded boxes , the menu drops down from the top and can shrink to a favorites bar , and on the top bar you get a homescreen - switching button , notifications area , plus a status area , all of which can be triggered by just a tap instead of a drag action .
Unlike most other Android phones , to remove a homescreen icon on the Streak you have to hold down on it until it goes red , and then press the menu button for the remove option ( and some widgets , such as the RSS reader , will also show a " Widget options " button ) .
This makes sense , as dragging an icon across a five - inch screen is n't really ideal .
As for the phone dialer , we 're slightly disappointed that Dell 's still using the same dull skin as seen on our prototype -- we have no issues with the dialpad layout , but the overall style just looks unfinished , plus we 'd prefer to see the call log displaying pictures alongside contact numbers .
Also , we 're shocked that the Streak does n't support smart - dialing , but then again we 've only seen HTC offering this feature on its Android phones .
Of course , provided that you 're in a quiet environment , you can always just use voice search to get to a contact , and you get two options for this : the default voice search app , or the Nuance Voice Control app that can be launched by just holding down your handsfree kit 's button .
The latter can even take dictated numbers , although it never worked for us , and we suspect our British accent is to be blamed .
Camera
Following the conventionally sized Mini 3 Aero , Dell decided to plunge into an untouched territory with its second - ever smartphone .
The result is an unusual form factor -- a 10 mm - thick slab with a five - inch 800 x 480 LCD ( much like the Archos 5 PMP but with capacitive touch overlay ) , and it's one damn good screen that 's usable under the sun , too .
Of course , we 've seen it all back in February , but our enthusiasm has not dwindled in the slightest -- the final Streak still has the same sexy figure , is still as rigid , and is still as pocketable in our regular - fit jeans .
No , really -- there 's been a lot of debate on whether people would actually put the Streak in their pockets , but like we said before , as long as you 're not into hippie - tight pants , the slate should happily fit in like a regular phone .
The only time that you might struggle is when you 're walking up stairs , but a quick push to the outer side of the pocket should do the trick .
More on that in the video below .
Our four - month ownership of the prototype has proven that the Streak 's quite the attention seeker , even before we revealed to the intrigued passers - by that it 's also a phone .
We even gave the screen 's Gorilla Glass some real beating , although such toughness does n't seem to extend to the plastic parts on the two sides of the phone -- we 're already seeing some fine scratches there .
But of course , the more important question is : is this form factor practical at all ?
Well , let 's start with the grip -- the rounded edges on the two shorter sides allow us to hold it comfortably like a PSP .
We can even hold the 220g ( 7.76 ounces ) device single - handedly that way with little effort , but we tend to hold on the left to avoid accidentally touching the capacitive buttons on the other side .
As for holding in portrait position ( when making a phone call , for instance ) , the flat edges mean our finger tips can securely grip onto the phone .
We do n't have a preference for either posture , as it really depends on what you 're doing -- obviously video playback is best in landscape , whereas web browsing can work both ways depending on the text layout , and e-book reading is ideal in portrait mode due to shorter lines .
If you 're all for making phone calls in a more discrete manner , you can always opt for the handsfree kit or a Bluetooth headset ( 2.0 with EDR ) instead .
Going back to the phone : there 's a front - facing VGA camera between the earpiece and proximity sensor ( for disabling the screen while making a call ) , ready for video chat apps such as Fring and Qik -- neither of which were able to use the Streak 's secondary camera just yet .
On the back of the phone you 'll see a five megapixel autofocus camera with its dual LED flash ( more on the picture quality later ) , a mono speaker that produces loud sound with less distortion than most other phones , and a sliding battery door ( which is now tightened by two little paddings not seen on our prototype ) .
Now , be warned : if you remove the door while your phone 's running , failing to replace it within a few seconds would turn it off .
We were told that this is actually a data - loss prevention mechanism , so we 'll assume the phone will actually quit all the processes before killing the power .
Anyway , the chamber underneath the cover houses the SIM card , microSD card ( ours came with SanDisk 's Class 2 16GB silicon ) , and a 1530 mAh battery .
To grill the battery , we had the Streak connected to 3G ( HSDPA ) only , continuously played music , had background sync enabled ( including the Facebook widget , RSS widget , and Twicca ) , occasionally browsed the web on it , and took a few photos and videos .
Guess what ?
Surprisingly -- especially given the screen size -- we managed to get almostper charge !
On a more realistic usage like less music playback and more reliance on WiFi 802.11b/ g , we even squeezed out at least 12 hours of sweet battery juice .
This certainly makes the HTC Desire look feeble with its mere six - hour gig from a similar usage .
The Streak 's battery life may well be impressive , but what about its performance as a phone ?
Pretty good , we 'd say -- last night we made a 25 - minute call with the Streak held against our face the whole time , and our hand and arm were still alive after that .
We also did our usual noise test and the Streak managed to suppress a fair amount of background noise , as you can see in the video above .
That said , we do have some minor complaints about the dialer , but we 'll talk about that later .
Another preloaded app is QuickOffice , which not only can view Microsoft Office documents ( .doc , .docx , .xls , xlsx , .ppt , and .pptx ) , but also makes a great file browser and can open other file types using their associated apps .
Just too bad that it can't edit Word and Excel files , plus the text on some of the PowerPoint slides did n't render well , but the app's there if you need it .
Corporate users may also be interested in the 30 - day demo of TouchDown suite , which grabs your email , contacts , calendar and tasks via Exchange ActiveSync .
Moving on to the built - in apps , let 's start with the browser : as expected on a 1GHz Snapdragon device , rendering and pinch - zooming are pretty quick and smooth , but we find it strange that we can't tap to zoom .
Also , the text does n't reflow to the width of the screen , but given the screen size , most of the time we 're happy with the original text layout .
Next we have Google Maps : well , there 's not much to say except that you get so much more real estate than you can on other phones , and we have several pictures to prove it -- just perfect for car navigation .
Annoyingly , pinch - to - zoom is still disabled in Maps thanks to the 1.6 OS , but we 'll live through it for now .
So here 's the " Photos & Videos " app , which is actually ArcSoft Mobile Media Gallery .
As you can see above , Dell and ArcSoft have gone for the timeline approach , and have put up 18 sensibly - sized thumbnails at a time .
The overall performance is pretty smooth too , but understandably the further down the timeline you go , the more likely you 'll experience some lag while older thumbnails are being loaded .
This implementation is great for viewing media captured using the Streak 's camera , but to browse media files that you added manually , you 'd best be using QuickOffice to find them .
Also , we 'd like to see Flickr and Picasa integration here , as implemented by the Desire and Nexus One respectively .
Speaking of media , the Streak 's supposed to support H.263/H.264 , 3GP , MPEG4 , and WMV videos .
Like our prototype , this final Streak played our MP4V - encoded 480 p and 720 p clips ( up to 7.4 M bps bit rate ) without a hitch , although for some reason it would n't open full - length films that were encoded the same way , even at 3 M bps and lower .
More disappointingly , we had no luck with any of our H.264 clips despite the bit rate limited to 3.2 Mbps , so we do wonder if this codec 's supported at all -- maybe Archos can lend Dell a hand ?
On a brighter note , our WMV clips -- both VGA and 720 p -- came out as good as the MP4V videos .
Last but not least , YouTube videos looks great on the five - inch screen , but we 've noticed a bug : if you have music playing in the background , the YouTube app simply plays video over the music rather than pausing it ( like the Nexus One and Desire do ) .
We 're certain that Dell 's team of talents can easily fix this ( and we certainly hope that they 're reading this ) .
We wo n't go too deep into the music player as it's pretty much identical to what we 've seen before , but we 've found a couple of new features .
Firstly , the app will actually automatically grab mugshots of the artists , so we were a bit surprised to see Lady Gaga flashing her legs on the Artists page .
Secondly , we discovered that you can skip a track by clicking the handsfree button twice , but here 's a caveat : we often found ourselves clicking too fast for the Streak to respond properly , whereas the iPhone would n't have a problem with the same click rate .
Also , for some reason , you need to have the screen turned on -- regardless of phone lock state -- for the music player to respond to clicks .
Very bizarre , but probably very easy to fix .
Before we wrap up our multimedia rant , we 'd like to talk about the lack of FM radio -- do n't know about you folks in the US , but us Brits still fancy the occasional live audio shows while commuting , especially in 3G - congested areas .
We 're not sure if the hardware 's there , but if it is , a small statue will be made in honor of whoever can hack it .
So , it 's time to whine about other things .
First of all , the keyboard : it 's not everyday that you see a numeric keypad on a phone 's virtual keyboard , and there 's a good reason for that -- it ruins the phone 's ergonomic symmetry as our right thumb has to stretch over the numpad while typing .
We were hoping that maybe Dell would put in a numpad - free keyboard as an option in Settings , but as far as we can see , we 've got nothing .
Nevertheless , both keyboards are still pretty responsive .
Second thing : while the Calendar app may look delicious on the five - inch screen , we were surprised that the entries in week view mode bear no text description , whereas the 3.7 - inch Nexus One ( with Froyo ) manages to pack in those details .
Finally , we 're puzzled by the missing contacts pictures -- we were expecting the Streak to pull photos off Facebook , and the box has definitely been ticked for this in Settings .
Hopefully our friends in the States wo n't be suffering from these bugs next month Looking back at our old sample pictures , it looks like Dell 's dialed up the sharpening settings on the five - megapixel autofocus camera .
As you can see in the gallery below ( with picture quality set to " Fine " ) , the outdoor shots are pretty good except for the slight over - saturation in general , but nightshots are just hopeless .
As for the camcorder , not much has changed for the 640 x 480 clips -- picture quality 's acceptable despite the same saturation and nightshot flaws , plus the lack of 720 p option puts the Streak slightly behind the game .
That said , unlike the latest HTC phones , the Streak 's camcorder does n't suffer from reduced frame rate when filming in a dark environment -- see for yourself after the gallery .

The Sun could be the best place to look for dark matter - the invisible ‘ stuff ’ that is thought to make up about 83 % of the matter in the Universe .
That ’s what new Oxford University research reported in a recent Physical Review Letters suggests .
The work looks at the possibility that dark matter is much lighter than the WIMP particles most dark matter hunters are looking for .
Such ‘ heavy ’ particles are also their own antiparticles , so that when a WIMP meets a WIMP they annihilate each other , making it puzzling that there ’s still so much dark matter around .
The Oxford team ask : what if , instead of being 100 times the mass of a proton , dark matter particles were only 5 times heavier than a proton but had the same asymmetry - excess of particles over antiparticles ?
‘ If it were five times heavier , it would get five times the abundance .
That ’s what dark matter is , ’ Subir Sarkar of Oxford University ’s Rudolf Peierls Centre for Theoretical Physics , who led the work with Mads Frandsen , told Wired.com 's Lisa Grossman .
‘ That ’s the simplest explanation for dark matter in my view . ’
Because these ‘ light ’ dark matter particles do n’t annihilate each other , Subir and Mads explain , they could be hoovered up by the gravity of a star like our Sun and trapped there .
Subir comments :
‘ The sun has been whizzing around the galaxy for 5 billion years , sweeping up all the dark matter as it goes . ’
The idea that the Sun acts as a cage for a large amount of dark matter could help to solve a long - standing mystery of solar physics - how the Sun transports heat from its core to the surface so fast when photons and ordinary particles should be colliding with each other , slowing the process down .
Dark matter particles inside the Sun interact very weakly with ordinary matter ( but more strongly with each other ) and can transport heat to the surface in a novel manner .
‘ When we do the calculation , it turns out that this effect may help to solve the solar composition problem , ’ Subir reveals .
Even better , calculations of what this component of dark matter would do to neutrinos given off by the Sun indicate that its effect would be detectable by two upcoming experiments : Borexino and SNO +.
‘ We know protons make up most of the luminous matter in the universe and , as opposed to many other particles , we know the origin of the proton mass and why it is stable , ’ Mads tells me .
‘ So it really is a simple and intuitive idea that dark matter would share properties with the proton .
Instead the WIMP type candidates in fact are nothing like the proton . ’
Subir adds : ‘ It ’s a speculative idea , but it ’s testable .
And the tools to test it are coming on line pretty fast .
We do n’t have to wait 20 years . ’

Dr. Duprat and his colleagues drilled into the snow and in the cores they retrieved found two particles , each 100th of a micron in size , that were exactly what they were looking for .

Because of the depth at which the materials were found , about 12 feet , they were able to estimate that they were deposited into the Earth from 1955 to 1970 .
By studying the molecules and minerals in the particles , which , though tiny , each contain enough material to analyze , the researchers were able to determine that the sediments were formed in our solar system billions of years ago .
Their results are published in the May 7 Journal of Science .
To determine the particles ’ origins , the scientists looked at their chemical makeup .
They had larger amounts of carbon and deuterium , a form of hydrogen , than anything found on Earth , Dr. Duprat said .
He and his colleagues further analyzed the chemical makeup , and found that the compositions of the particles were similar to remnants from comets , including Halley ’s Comet .
The grains may be as old as the sun , he said .
Future research might reveal more about exactly how these particles formed , and how they arrived on earth .
But that will require more trips to the Concordia Research Station in Antarctica , and more samples .
The Porsche 911 GT3 R Hybrid has been a head turner since Porsche whipped the sheets off it at this years Geneva Motorshow , the car has a hybrid KERS ( kinetic energy recovery system ) developed for them by the Williams Formula 1 team .
In essence this is a flywheel that stores energy otherwise lost under braking by spinning at up to 40,000 rpm , when the boost is required the driver hits a paddle and releases 160 hp of additional power to the front wheels through twin electric motors .
160 hp does n’t sound like a whole lot however the car already has a 480 hp petrol engine in the back powering the rear wheels , so this hybrid has serious pulling power .
The sounds that come out of this car are unlike anything we ’ve heard since the last time Han Solo hit the warp drive button in the Millenium Falcon , watch the video above with sound on and you ’ll see our point .
Is this the sound of future hybrid racing cars ?
We certainly hope so .

A hiss pierces the air as music fans wait in line outside the Brooklyn Bowl in Williamsburg .
Across the street from the venue , a man stoops over his tank , inflating balloons and passing them to his associates by the fistful .
He shuts off the valve and surveys the scene .
Deciding his handlers are moving too slowly , he picks up the tank and slams it against the corner of the warehouse , sending a shrieking echo into the night .
“ I do n’t see you working fast enough ! ” he yells .
Then he unleashes an exploding stream of gas into the air , rapidly firing left and right and cackling devilishly like a kid with a water pistol .
The balloon man , who asks not to be named , has a shaved head and a New England accent .
He ’s the leader of the Boston ring of the “ Nitrous Mafia ” — a term invented by critics of his business .
The Disco Biscuits performance is about to start .
And the fans in line are high from his laughing gas .
“ Fatty whippets ! ” yell the balloon man ’s eight or nine dealers , holding balloon clusters high in the air .
Some of the dealers are locals , contracted out for the night , while the rest hail from Massachusetts and Rhode Island .
When a police car is seen from a distance , a trio of spotters yells , “ Six - Up ” — a warning to keep cool .
Selling nitrous oxide for the purpose of getting high is illegal , but the club ’s bouncers do n’t seem to mind the huffing .
“ The security here is cool , ” says a dealer named Chrystal , a single mother who is dating the Boston capo , whom we ’ll call Dmitri .
Throughout the year , the Nitrous Mafia travels from state to state , selling balloons at concert sites .
The scene in Williamsburg is only a small preview of what happens in summer , when the outdoor festival season kicks into gear .
During these campground events , which last two to four days , the Mafia , which is divided into two rings , based in Boston and Philadelphia , can burn through hundreds of nitrous tanks .
With the ability to fill up to 350 balloons per tank , which they sell for $ 5 and $ 10 , they can bank more than $ 300,000 per festival , minus expenses .
Year after year , security guards at these events attempt to crack down on the illicit business , but , in most cases , they ’re outmatched by a phalanx of menacing gas dealers who have little regard for unarmed concert personnel .
And for some musicians and their fans , the illicit trade is a bummer .
“ It has a negative impact on the entire scene , ” says Don Richards , the tour manager for Umphrey ’s McGee , ranked the No. 4 jam band in a recent Rolling Stone poll .
“ It ’s a very controlling group , to the point where I ’ve seen people get beat up . ”
“ It ’s something that should be left to the dentist ’s office , ” says Josh Clark , the lead vocalist for the San Francisco–based jam band Tea Leaf Green .
But Dmitri , who has been in and out of jail on multiple occasions , defends the operation .
“ You do n’t want it , do n’t buy it , ” he says , taking a break from his balloon hustle .
“ We ’re not forcing you to do anything .
You can keep walking . ”
He lives in Rhode Island , but he and his associates will crash at his New York apartment tonight .
Business has been slow , he says , and each worker will probably clear only $ 300 for this show .
But he hopes things will pick up during the summer .
When asked , he denies his crew is an organized crime ring .
“ There is no Nitrous Mafia , ” he says .
It is inevitable .
At any East Coast summer music festival , from Maine to Miami Beach , the opening chords eventually give way to the whistling of tanks .
In parking lots and alleyways .
In mountain crevasses and open fields .
At popular campsite events like All Good , in Masontown , West Virginia ; Bonnaroo , in Manchester , Tennessee ; and Gathering of the Vibes , in Bridgeport , Connecticut .
The Nitrous Mafia is there .
“ You hear the hiss of that tank , and you know you ’re approaching a shady corner , ” says Clark , of Tea Leaf Green .
“ When I ’m near it , I ’m always afraid I ’ll wind up in some blurb for a music magazine . ”
Nitrous is called “ hippie crack ” because of its addictive qualities .
Every morning , the festival campgrounds are riddled with balloons , “ like bullet shells on a battlefield , ” says a fan .
Unlike traditional drugs , which have long - lasting effects and can carry a fan through a concert , the high from N20 is cheap and quick .
After that , it ’s often back to the end of the tank line for another round .
“ It ’s an instant rush of pure euphoria , but it only lasts for 30 seconds or a minute , and then you want it back , ” says Justin Heller , a fan who owns his own biodiesel company .
He no longer does balloons , but remembers the days of buying 15 in a row .
“ You do n’t think about your money — you ’re just like , ‘ I want that again , I want that again , I want that again . ’ ”
But some jam - band fans complain that the nitrous racket is harshing their idyllic pursuit , recalling a time , they say , when laughing gas was a part of the hippie ethos .
“ It ’s a sore on the scene , ” says Kevin Calabro , a Brooklyn - based publicist for jam bands .
“ It ’s been taken over by dirtbags and Mafia punks .
It used to be , in the old Dead days , that some hippies got their hands on a tank , and it was a mellow and loose kind of thing .
Now it ’s become some dirty - ass shit that ’s too easy to abuse . ”
“ These people are evil , ” says Don Bryant , a retired Army captain and emergency medical technician , who also vends T - shirts at shows .
During a recent Bonnaroo festival , he says , “ One guy with a $ 5 balloon of nitrous came crashing through my booth , being chased by a guy with a knife .
He almost took out my daughter , who was a little baby . ”
Scott Percival , a Boston police officer who serves as a security guard for the Gathering of the Vibes , says he was once offered $ 10,000 by a dealer to look the other way , and recalls stumbling onto one beaten - up and unconscious seller lying in the parking lot , pockets empty .
“ He was selling nitrous , and the other guys came in and took him out .
It happens all the time , ” he says .
“ It ’s a big - time problem , ” echoes Dennis O’Connor , a Hartford police officer who confiscated 25 tanks outside a Phish show last year .
Forced to play a four - day game of Whac - a - Mole , the guards at festivals move in on one dealer with a tank , and another pops up on the other side of the park .
“ It ’s frighteningly organized , ” says Richards , of Umphrey ’s McGee .
“ They know how to hide and get out of a scene very quickly .
I ’ve witnessed them set up for 10 minutes and make thousands of dollars selling balloons .
And as soon as security and police converge on a location , they ’re gone .
They disappear .
They think things out very clearly about how they ’re going to escape certain situations . ”
For concertgoers , the most dangerous risk of nitrous is the potential for users to pass out and hit the pavement .
“ I ’ve watched so many young people crack their heads and faces open that I have personally stopped providing emergency first aid , ” says Bryant , the EMT .
“ People will crack themselves open .
I ’ve seen them fall and bust out all their teeth .
I ’ve seen them fall and hit glass .
They fall like flies all over the place .
It ’s a sad thing . ”
Pointing to a scar on his chin , one fan elaborates on a recent nitrous experience in Pittsburgh : “ My last thoughts were , ‘ I need to sit down right now , ’ and the next thing I know , I wake up in a pool of blood with five people surrounding me . ”
Last year , a festivalgoer turned up dead at Gathering of the Vibes .
Within days , the jam - band blogosphere lit up , hurling accusations at the Nitrous Mafia , with claims that the victim was beaten with a tank , sprayed with gas , and burned alive .
Weeks later , a toxicology report ruled that he died from a simple drug overdose , but the episode was still a black eye for festival promoter Ken Hays , who came under fire from Bridgeport authorities for failure to control the scene .
Despite confiscating about 100 tanks , the security guards at Vibes proved no match for the gas mob .
“ We were overrun , ” admits a security executive .
“ We were n’t counting on the amount of nitrous they would bring in . ” Kevin O’Brien , the marketing director of last year ’s Vibes , says he was offered a bribe of thousands of dollars by a nitrous dealer named “ Crispy . ”
The firm Security Operations Consultants , one of five security companies that worked the festival , was the subject of an FBI investigation for allegedly failing to turn over tanks and drugs taken from concertgoers to the police .
Despite the scandal , Hays eventually won his months - long battle to bring his festival , born out of Jerry Garcia ’s death , back to Bridgeport .
( The event is scheduled to run July 29 to August 1 . )
He has instituted a zero - tolerance balloon ban this year and is working with the Bridgeport police force and City Council to make the possession of nitrous oxide illegal in Bridgeport ’s public parks .
He says he hopes legislation will be enacted before the festival , though the parks commissioner is n’t sure that it can be enforced .
The guards are n’t sure , either .
“ People just do n’t know what ’s going on , ” says Marshall Rodriguez , the owner of the security firm in charge of the backstage area of Vibes .
( Indeed , two cops interviewed by the Voice referred to the gas as “ helium . ” )
A few years ago , Rodriguez almost shut down his business after one of his guards was pistol - whipped and another threatened at knifepoint by nitrous dealers at a festival in West Virginia .
“ You got a group of guys who are coming in . . . [ making ] money they ’re willing to go to great lengths to protect , even if it means hurting somebody , even if it means hurting security , ” he said .
“ It ’s just starting to get out of control . ”
Inside a dimly lit roadhouse in Nowheresville , Massachusetts , “ Sean ” has agreed to talk about his time as a member of the Nitrous Mafia , provided his real name is n’t used and the venue is n’t named .
Twenty - four years old , Sean sips a bottle of lager and speaks in a raspy whisper .
His dreadlocked hair spills over his Grateful Dead visor and down his back , and a green bandanna hangs loosely from his neck .
In a few minutes , he will take the stage as a guitarist for one of the bands playing tonight .
A self - described hippie , he was considered a valuable member of the Mafia because he blended in at festivals .
Sean explains that the Boston ring of the Nitrous Mafia is made up of about 16 members split into two units , with the entire operation run by the Rhode Island kingpin , Dmitri — the guy with the New England accent slamming the tank against the wall in Williamsburg .
With the help of false paperwork , gang members fill up tanks of various sizes at a local nitrous shop , which is a kitchen - supply store called New England Fountain , located in Burlington , Massachusetts .
( The store ’s owner , Paul Abramo , says he ’s aware that some of his customers might be illegal dealers , but it ’s impossible to regulate : “ We try to make sure they ’re a business , but beyond that , it ’s really out of our control . ” )
During festival season , gang members are able to fill 40 nitrous tanks at a time for $ 75 each , says Sean .
During his employment , the two Boston crews would duel each other every night to see who could make more money .
“ It was almost like a game to us , ” he says .
Members of each unit split 30 percent of the profits , while the remaining 70 percent was funneled back to their bosses .
The Philadelphia ring is larger and split up into several sub-crews who know each other but operate independently , says Sean .
“ The Philly guys are more reckless , ” he says , and more prone to violence and intimidation .
“ They operate without a code of honor .
They were the first kids I saw bringing guns to the lots and putting fuckin’ shit to people ’s heads . ”
The Philadelphia don , who owns his own nitrous supply store and has several workers underneath him , is less apt to show up at festivals himself , says Sean .
“ He ’s a fucking nut job , ” he adds , noting that even Dmitri is deferential to him .
Sean , who admits that he has been in and out of jail for drug charges , was recruited into the Mafia last year during a time when he had no money and no food and was struggling to see his favorite bands .
During All Good , a mob acquaintance offered to pay him to go on balloon runs .
“ Next thing I know , I made $ 60 in 40 minutes , ” Sean recalls .
“ It was big money .
Eventually , I started making $ 900 a weekend . ”
He was employed for a four - month period , during which time he spent nearly every day on the road with his colleagues , living in hotels and U - Haul vans .
He fell in love with the lifestyle because of the instant respect that came with being a balloon seller .
Girls would remove their tops in front of him just for a huff .
“ It worked all the fuckin ’ time , ” he says .
Fans would drop $ 200 in three hours at his tank .
As a full - time Mafia member , Sean was known for his crafty methods of sneaking tanks past security guards .
“ I liked to store them inside box springs , ” he says .
“ We ’d strip out the bottom and stash six cans inside .
Then we ’d lay it back down , put a mattress and blanket on it and make the bed .
Security would open the back of the U - Haul , see a made bed , close the door , and let us ride right on through . ”
On other occasions , he ’d rip out the floor panels of vans and stash the tanks , which were always spray - painted black , in the undercarriage .
“ We ’d laugh our way through every check point with three fuckin ’ tanks underneath the car , ” he says .
A colleague of his — a woman with a young child — would often traffic tanks hidden under blankets in her baby stroller .
During festival season , the Boston and Philadelphia crews band together , operating in higher numbers , assisted by a recruited class of lower - level minions who are n’t card - carrying members of the Nitrous Mafia but are eager to make a summer buck .
They ’re often ex-cons — ” crack dealers and dirtbag kids straight outta jail , ” says Sean — who like the idea of selling balloons to rich kids while inhaling all the nitrous balloons they want for free .
The full - time workers handle the money and oversee the stash houses , while the younger kids serve as lookouts and runners , communicating with one another with verbal signs and cell phone texts .
“ It ’s usually six guys to a tank , ” explains Sean .
“ One guy strappin ’ , one guy fillin’ , one guy takin’ money , then usually three lookouts spread out in a triangle about 20 feet in each direction watching for security . ”
After leaving on bad terms — he wo n’t go into detail —
Sean says he wishes he had never gotten caught up with the mob .
“ I realize the demons associated with it , ” he says .
“ They ’re really ruining the hippie scene . ”
Then he leaves the table , grabs his guitar , and takes the stage , launching into the opening stanza of the blues .
Nitrous oxide has been around as long as the jam bands themselves .
There is one brief scene in The Grateful Dead Movie , a documentary about a series of San Francisco shows in 1974 , in which nitrous is consumed with an octopus - like hose .
“ It was easy to come by , and part of the party , ” says songwriter and producer David Gans , a collaborator of Jerry Garcia’s .
During the 1970s , the gas was sometimes supplied at recording studios .
By the mid-’80s , the tanks began appearing on “ Shakedown Street , ” the name for the public marketplace that Dead Heads ginned up at concert venues to finance their continuous touring .
By the end of the decade , nitrous was standard fare , supplied primarily by out - of - town dentists .
But many Dead Heads were turned off by the tanks from the onset and began referring to the dealers as “ tour rats ” who made money off the mother ship .
“ They saw the nitrous vendors as people from outside of the subculture sucking profits out of the scene , ” says sociologist Rebecca Adams , a professor and associate provost at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro .
“ They would sell the nitrous and then disappear , without spending money on tour .
They were profiteers , or what Dead Heads called ‘ corporate vendors . ’ ” Garcia was aware of the problem , says Gans , “ but he was pathologically unable to take control and responsibility . ”
At the turn of the century , following the death of Garcia and the expansion of jam - band culture , Shakedown Streets along the East Coast began attracting nitrous dealers in greater numbers , along with people who looked less like Phish fans .
“ I began noticing that all the people selling balloons were n’t nice hippie kids trying to go from show to show , ” says fan Justin Heller .
“ It became clear that they were a bunch of thugs trying to make money . ”
“ They ’re sketchy , ” says one fan .
“ They ’re shit , ” says another .
One fan cuts right to the point : “ These guys do n’t even know who Jerry Garcia is , and they never will . ”
Other vendors began complaining that nitrous sales drove down their T - shirt and jewelry businesses .
“ Nitrous straight robs the pockets of the other workers , ” says Sean , the ex-member of the Nitrous Mafia .
“ Everybody ’s fuckin ’ broke ’ cause they dropped every dollar they had on nitrous . ”
This new class of gas dealers seemed to come almost exclusively from Philadelphia , where nitrous was easy to purchase .
By 2003 , the gas business had outgrown Shakedown Street and had crept onto street corners .
Outside some concerts , tanks were stationed several feet apart from each other .
Eventually , turf wars started breaking out , leading to intimidation and violence .
Stronger nitrous dealers would ask lower - level merchants to hand over their tanks — or risk the consequences .
“ If you start working Shakedown next to a bunch of the mob kids , and you try running your own tank there , you ’re gonna get that tank taken from you and it ’s gonna become theirs , unless you ’re paying them off , ” says Sean .
“ They do not let you work around them without being one of them .
And that ’s where the Mafia aspect really came around . ”
One fan says he was beaten up two years ago at Jones Beach because a dealer thought he stole a balloon .
Last year at Vibes ( where a portion of the park has been dubbed “ Nitrous Alley ” ) , a fan says he saw a dealer smash his tank on a man ’s head .
At a Phish show last year in Portland , Maine , a fan watched a parking attendant get pummeled .
Knives and bats were sneaked into lots .
“ I straight - up saw a Nitrous Mafia guy hit a cop ’s face in with a tank , ” says a man who recently attended All Good , a mountainous festival venue where gas is inhaled inside a deep gorge called “ Wookie Nitrous Cave . ”
“ Nobody fucks with those fuckers , ” says a tattoo artist who goes by the name PeaT .
Clark , of Tea Leaf Green , does n’t get why his fans are drawn to the stuff : “ There are certain drugs that enhance the concert experience — a little doobie here , or some mushrooms there , ” he says .
“ But I do n’t see how nitrous enhances the concert experience .
With other drugs , you can dance .
With nitrous , you slump onto a car and disappear until it ’s time for the next balloon .
They do n’t call it ‘ hippie crack ’ for nothing . ”
The U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency does n’t consider nitrous a controlled substance and does n’t regulate it .
Instead , it ’s monitored by the Food and Drug Administration as a food - grade propellant , medical - grade gas , and prescription drug .
It ’s legal to own it , but , like other inhalants , it ’s prohibited by the FDA to purchase and sell for the purposes of getting high .
Each state has its own laws against it , and most treat the illicit sale of nitrous as a misdemeanor , with penalties ranging from small fines to a few months in prison .
In what was likely the most significant federal crackdown on the gas , defendants from Philadelphia and New Jersey were charged with unlawful distribution of nitrous to an undercover police officer in the parking lot outside a Dave Matthews Band show at Washington , D.C. ’s Robert F. Kennedy Stadium in 2001 .
At an appeal hearing , a District Court judge ruled that the dealers ’ attempt to sell nitrous without a prescription was , in essence , a misbranding crime , in violation of the Food , Drug , and Cosmetic Act , and the defendants ’ cases were sent back down to lower courts .
Some environmentalists complain that nitrous is a greenhouse gas .
Some music fans say the hiss of the gas keeps them up at night .
Still others kvetch that the tank lines clog up the campgrounds , and that dealers use random tents as hiding places .
One fan says he was jolted from his sleep when a tank was slipped under his tent and slammed into his head .
Another said she had her tires slashed after disobeying orders not to move her car .
“ They have a total disregard for anyone ’s well - being but their own , ” says Rodriguez , the security executive .
“ They ’re only there for one reason : getting that money .
And they get it whatever the cost . ”
“ Mad adrenaline , mad money , mad pussy , ” says a Philadelphia nitrous dealer named Beef , explaining why he got into the business .
He ’s standing outside the Electric Factory , in the club - cluttered Northern Liberties section of the city , near the end of a Wilco show on a Saturday night .
Beef is with five of his gang mates ; together , they have three watermelon - size tanks stored in Nike gym bags , with reserves stowed inside the trunks of their cars .
One of the dealers , an older man who looks to be in his fifties , sits in an illegally parked SUV — a hiding place for tanks in case cops come .
A meter - reader approaches — a black woman , who notices the tanks .
Immediately , a tall dealer named Jimmy , who wears a baggy gray sweatsuit and looks like Shaggy from Scooby Doo , diverts her attention .
“ Damn , what ’s a fine - lookin ’ girl like you doing as a parking lady ? ” he asks , approaching her .
She smiles , charmed , and leans against the wall next to him .
“ I just gave out my last ticket , ” she says , letting the gang off the hook .
Later , Jimmy notices an Electric Factory security director pulling into the parking lot .
He is asked whether the director ever puts the kibosh on the nitrous parties .
“ He works both sides of the fence , ” he explains .
“ Most of the time , he ’s cool , but just like women , he wakes up every once in a while with PMS . ”
( At a later show , on a blisteringly hot day in Baltimore , Jimmy cooled down by emptying the contents of two nitrous balloons directly onto his face .
Then he hoisted a clump of black balloons into the air and barked his sales pitch : “ Once you go black , you never go back ! ” )
All of the nitrous dealers are civil , with the exception of the older man , who warns against taking photographs .
Beef , a husky Italian - American from South Philly , has a tongue ring , a lazy layer of facial scruff , and a pair of young daughters at home .
Twenty - four years old , Beef says he operates independently with a couple of associates , who together pocket about $ 50,000 a weekend in the summertime .
He offers a handshake and a free balloon .
It produces a pleasant sensation from head to toe .
So where did the term “ Nitrous Mafia ” come from , anyway ?
“ I think we use it as a negative connotation , like ‘ death tax ’ instead of ‘ estate tax , ’ ” offers Noah Wilderman , who has followed Phish since the early 1990s and is making a documentary about them .
“ It ’s definitely kids and bosses , but does that make it a mafia ? ”
His most vivid memory of the gas dealers was when Trey Anastasio played at Baltimore Symphony Orchestra , which attracted an upscale crowd .
“ I ’ll always remember a hundred people in ties and dress shirts passing out on the grass , ” he says .
“ They say we ’re all city guys and not hippie guys , ” says Beef .
“ That ’s why they made the Mafia up .
Because of guys like us , who do n’t blend in , wearing Jordan pants and $ 200 Jordan sneakers .
These kids come out like bobos in their hippie T - shirts . ”
Beef denies that nitrous leads to problems , and with a jovial , appealing demeanor , he seems anything but dangerous .
He says he ’s a smarter than most dealers .
“ Some people are ignorant and blast it all night , ” he says .
“ But I try to be respectful . ”
Asked about the violence , he says , “ Yeah , but you can get in fights over anything .
You can fight over a cigarette . ”
A few fans admit that some of the dealers are cool — and that much of the violence is n’t caused by them , but by stoners desperate for free gas .
“ These kids turn into hippie crackheads and hover over that fucking tank and have no money left , ” says Sean .
“ And they beg and beg , and the next thing you know , you got one hippie yelling at a bunch of mob kids , and that ’s when fist fights break out . ”
Elliott Dunwoody , the tour manager for the band Bassnectar , once observed one needy fan putting his lips directly to the nozzle of a tank : “ He actually tried to sip up the bit of nitrous that gets released after they pull the balloon off , ” he says .
“ The kids beat him up . ”
But other fans say that nitrous enhances the concert experience and appreciate the gas mob .
“ I love the balloons , ” says Bobby Goodlife , a nightlife promoter from Baltimore .
“ They ’re just fun . ”
When the Wilco show empties from the Electric Factory , the Philadelphia crew springs to action .
Three of the men squat down like catchers , each straddling a tank between their thighs , and begin inflating balloons at a rapid clip .
With a half - filled balloon dangling from his mouth and sweat dripping from his brow , Beef is particularly dexterous , able to hold five inflated balloons in his left hand , fill another in his right , and still manage to collect money from customers .
The three other men serve as lookouts and runners .
The older guy holds a clump of 10 purple balloons high in the air like a cotton candy vendor .
“ Ice - cold fatties , right off the tank ! ” he yells to concertgoers , who have now flooded the sidewalk , eager for a slurp of the gas .
A bald dealer named Carlo , clad in an ’ 80s - style nylon Phillies jacket , sells five fatties to a man in a limousine rolling by .
He offers another fan an entire tank — ” wholesale , ” he says — for $ 200 .
Then he gives a free balloon to a legless , homeless man parked in a wheelchair nearby .
A huffer named Stuart Woolf , who is resting against a chain - link fence , balloon in hand , is asked why he appreciates the gas business .
“ Because nitrous is the best orgasm I ’ve ever had in my life , ” he says .
There are signs that music fans are fighting back in larger numbers to keep the gas out of the scene .
After the death at the Vibes , a vigilante group called the Wrecking Crew , born out of the Grateful Dead Family — fans who followed the band , year after year — retaliated by smashing up a truck with Pennsylvania tags and leading chants of “ NO NITROUS ! ” to a chorus of festivalgoers .
“ The guy who owned the truck was dealing nitrous all weekend and had been followed back to his truck by the Family , ” says a fan .
A video currently circulating on YouTube depicts two Wrecking Crew soldiers taunting the Nitrous Mafia while dancing around a stolen tank wrapped in a sign reading “ 100 % $ cum . ”
“ Hey , Nitrous Mafia motherfuckers !
We stole your goddamned tank ! ” yells a man , face concealed by sunglasses and a towel , middle fingers raised .
Midway through the clip , a soiled pair of women ’s panties is thrown at the canister .
Security guards , too , say they ’ve had enough , claiming they ’re tired of being accused of being in on the take .
Inside a small Irish pub in Worcester , Massachusetts , Rodriguez , the director of Marker Security , which has staffed the Vibes each year since the inaugural Bridgeport festival in 2000 , tries to explain the difficulties of controlling the tank - toting dealers at an event as large as the Vibes , which last year attracted 30,000 fans .
“ If two of my guards try to walk over and take their tank , they ’re not walking back , ” says Rodriguez , 36 years old , cupping a bottle of Bud Light between his oversize hands .
His six - foot - two , 300 - pound frame hulks over the table .
“ My guards are n’t about to take their lives in their own hands and get beat up , ” he says .
“ Not for $ 8 an hour . ”
The nitrous dealers have different strategies for dealing with security , says Sean .
“ At Vibes , we brought in 30 tanks and planned to lose about five to security , ” he says .
“ At All Good , different crews would take a turn throwing a tank at the fuckin’ security .
We ’d hide the rest , and they ’d drive away with one tank , all proud .
Then they ’d come back an hour later and we ’d give ’em another one .
Usually we ’d give ’em a half - empty or almost - empty one .
As long as you keep giving them a bust once in a while , it looked like the security was working .
They thought they were hurting us a lot more than they were . ”
“ The cops have no idea how far most of these kids are willing to go , ” he adds .
Musicians are also starting to speak out .
“ It ’s not something that needs to be a part of the music , ” says Christopher Robin , of the Christopher Robin Band .
“ Emotionally , I do n’t want to see it .
There ’s nothing good about it .
There are no success stories . ”
“ If someone wants to go hit a whippet in their hotel room , that ’s great , ” says Richards of Umphrey ’s McGee .
“ But not to the point where it gets to be a very controlled monopoly on the tour .
They ’re just simply out there to make as much money as they possibly can and leave in their wake the destruction — whether it ’s the garbage or the people they might have beaten up along the way . ”
Rodriguez swears to me that this year ’s Vibes will be different .
He has a message for the nitrous dealers : “ Enough is enough .
We ’re no longer going to sit here and have you ruin our festivals .
We ’re gonna take it back .
If you ’re going to come and try and ruin our scene , we ’re going to shut you down . ”
But , minutes later , he pauses , thinking about his decade - long history fighting the balloon men .
“ I do n’t think we ’ll ever wipe it out , ” he concedes .
“ It ’s inevitable .
We can only hope to control it . ”

Image caption Greek pensioners took to the streets at the weekend in protest at budget cuts
Greek government bonds have been downgraded four notches to " junk " status by Moody 's credit rating agency .
The agency said there was still " considerable uncertainty " surrounding the impact of measures introduced to cut the country 's high budget deficit .
Greece is looking to slash its deficit from 14 % of GDP to 3 % by 2014 .
But Moody 's said that the outlook on Greece 's rating is now stable , and that it would likely remain unchanged over the next 12 to 18 months .
Despite the downgrade from A3 to Ba1 , the agency said the risk of Greece defaulting on its debt was low .
In April , Standard & Poor 's , one the three main international credit rating agencies alongside Moody 's and Fitch , also downgraded Greek government debt to junk status .
Auditors ' inspection
Earlier , international auditors began sifting through Greece 's finances to assess progress on its draconian austerity measures .
The auditors will spend a week assessing progress , talking to government ministers , officials and independent experts in the country .
The European Union ( EU ) and International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) experts were sent to Greece under the terms of an aid package to save Greece from defaulting on its debts .
Last month , the EU , IMF and European Central Bank pledged 110bn euros ( $ 134bn ; £ 91 bn ) to help avert financial collapse in Greece .
The money was conditional on Greece making substantial cuts to its deficit .
On Monday , Greek finance minister George Papaconstantinou said that the recovery plan was already ahead of schedule .
According to official figures , the deficit for January to May was 8.9bn euros compared with 14.6bn euros over the same period in 2009 .
Under the first phase of its recovery plan , Greece must get the deficit down to 8.1 % by the end of this year .
Last week , ECB president Jean - Claude Trichet praised the progress Greece had made towards reducing the deficit .
Meanwhile , the Bank of Italy said on Monday that the country 's public debt reached a record 1.8 trillion euros in April .
Sovereign debt worry
Last year , Italy 's public debt - the sum of all borrowing - reached 115.8 % of GDP , and is predicted to rise to 118.4 % this year .
Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has announced an austerity package designed to bring the deficit down from the current 5.3 % to 2.7 % by 2012 .
The announcement underlines how sovereign debt worries have spread well beyond Greece to other European countries .
Also on Monday , the government in heavily indebted Spain was in talks with opposition parties to try to win support for radical changes to the employment laws .
Spain , with a jobless rate approaching 20 % , faces a wave of strikes .
Last month , Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero's government narrowly avoided a crisis when the legislature passed a 15 bn - euro deficit reduction programme by just one vote .

The Courageous Parents Glenn Beck ’s Minions Who Got This Jersey High School to Ban a Book About LGBT Kids

On Tuesday , the Rancocas Valley High School in Mt. Holly , New Jersey ( motto : “ Perseverance , Respect , Integrity , Diversity , Excellence ” ) , allowed parents to vote the board voted to ban from its library Revolutionary Voices , a book released in 2000 and described as a “ groundbreaking ” collection of short stories that “ speaks to the isolation and fear of being queer and young . ”
Oh , and it ’s all about queer youth !

The photo of “ one man bent at the waist with another man standing close behind him ” is actually “ a stock photo of one man hiking a football to the other . ” )
Continue teaching children that there ’s a reason to be scared of gay people , and children will continue growing up to be gay bashing adults .
Update : Turns out the 9.12 Project , which Glenn Beck started , is behind the campaign to ban the book .
The 18 residents who lobbied the school board acknowledged they were working on behalf of 9.12 .
No matter how many thousands of things confront you ,
no matter how painful or difficult ,
even if someone you love is about to die ,
entrust all of these to your foundation ,
your inherent nature ,
your true essence .
It ’s always been taking care of me ,
it ’s guiding me even now ,
so what ’s there to worry about ?
Just entrust everything there
while going forward .
You need this kind of attitude .
All of those things that confront you are your homework ,
the path through which you can grow .
If everything in your life is smooth and trouble free ,
you wo n’t be able to rise above the level
of an unenlightened being ,
or understand the hardships facing others .
It all depends upon how well you can handle good and evil ,
on how non-dually you can let go of both sides ,
even including the Buddha .
Frustration , stress , and loneliness ,
and situations where success seems unlikely ,
all of these things are the raw materials of your spiritual practice .
So , when difficulties and suffering come ,
be grateful for them .
For through these
you are able to practice and to grow .

WASHINGTON --( BUSINESS WIRE ) -- In his speech on the Gulf oil catastrophe tonight , President Obama can give the nation not only a message of hope , but also a concrete plan to cut the nation ’s oil dependence dramatically , said fourteen national , regional and local organizations said today .
“ The nation ’s dependence on petroleum need not be permanent .
The road to freedom from oil imports has already been mapped .
The President can start our nation on the journey tonight , ” the organizations said in a joint statement .
“ We do n’t need more analysis – it has already been done .
With the President ’s leadership we can start implementing the solution immediately . ”
“ This transition will produce millions of American jobs , recapture hundreds of billions of dollars that now go offshore , rather than being invested in America and American jobs , and most importantly , make America and the world more secure , ” they said .
The organizations represent a wide spectrum of corporate , environmental and public interests .
“ We are in a crisis .
It is time to face it head - on with all the tools we have .
Deployment plans by the National Academies of Science and by various private organizations show the way .
The key remaining ingredient is a national will .
The good news is that the U.S. can virtually eliminate use of petroleum in our passenger cars by 2050 with the right combination of policies , research and assistance to commercialize a portfolio of vehicle and fuel technologies .
Efficiency , biofuels , natural gas , battery electric and fuel cell electric vehicles all will make a contribution , ” they said .
“ We must set aside notions about any one ‘ winning ’ technology and focus on results , beginning now and sticking with the program for the long term .
The future of the oil economy looks even worse than today ’s grim reality .
With American engineering skill and with committed and focused leadership from our government , we can , and indeed we must , build a clean energy economy , ” the organizations said .

A drunk man who attempted to ride a 5 m ( 16ft ) long crocodile at a reptile enclosure in Australia has survived his encounter .
The crocodile , called Fatso , bit Michael Newman 's leg , tearing chunks of flesh from him as he straddled the animal .
Mr Newman was able to escape from its bite and walked back to a pub where he had been drinking to seek help .
Park owner Malcolm Douglas called Mr Newman 's attempt to ride the crocodile " bizarre " and " stupid " .

FBI agents have raided the homes of three alleged members of a hacker gang that harassed a security expert who helped put the group 's leader in jail , according to a recently unsealed search warrant affidavit .
Jesse William McGraw , aka " GhostExodus , " pleaded guilty in May to computer - tampering charges for putting malware on a dozen machines at the Texas hospital where he worked as a security guard .
He also installed the remote - access program LogMeIn on the hospital 's Windows - controlled HVAC system .
Last month 's raids were prompted by the aftermath of McGraw 's arrest .
McGraw was the leader of an anarchistic hacking group called the Electronik Tribulation Army , and his bust led to a flood of harassment against the Mississippi computer - security researcher who discovered screenshots of the HVAC access online and informed the FBI .
" They set up website in my name to pose as me , and put up embarrassing content or things they thought would embarrass me , including a call - to - action to buy sex toys , and fake pornographic images , " says R. Wesley McGrew , 30 , of McGrew Security .
" They harvested e-mail addresses from the university I work at and e-mailed it out to those . "
McGrew ( who has no relation to McGraw ) , also suffered DDoS attacks to his website , and threatening e-mails , phone calls and IMs , according to the FBI .
The harassment was " affecting a potential witness in an official proceeding , " the affidavit reads , and thus may violate federal law against witness intimidation .
On June 23 , the FBI raided the homes of ETA members " Fixer , " " dev/ /null " and " Xon " in Manteca , California ; Hamilton , Ohio ; and Pittsburg , Kansas , respectively , as well as the home of McGraw 's sister in Grand Prairie , Texas .
The search warrant affidavit was unsealed Friday .
McGrew says the harassment stopped after the raids .
A notice on the ETA 's website strikes a defiant note .
" On the 23rd of June 2010 the Federal Bureau of Investigation issued search warrants on ETA members , " the site reads .
" All their computers and electronic devices have been taken for forensic investigation ....
We are not terrorists , we are freedom fighters and cyber protesting is not illegal . "
From the search - warrant affidavit ( .pdf ) , McGraw 's connection to the harassment appears thin .
But the FBI also claims McGraw tipped off another ETA member that the FBI was on his trail , potentially violating obstruction - of - justice law .
On April 17 , while McGraw was in jail for the HVAC access , the government gave his attorney a copy of his colleague Fixer 's Gmail and YouTube accounts in pre-trial discovery , revealing that they had Fixer under surveillance .
Three days later , McGraw phoned his sister , and in a monitored phone call told her to instruct ETA - member dev//null to post a warning note to the group 's website .
" I need you to tell him that [ it 's ] ' defcon black ' for Fixer , " he said .
" [ S ] ay that Fixer is now ' defcon black . '…
You need to put it where they can see it ... where everyone can see it .
This is very important .
There is nothing more important than this in life right now . "
He made similar emphatic calls to his wife and a friend , and then his sister again , remarking , " I was told by my attorney that they want to prosecute [ Fixer ] and arrest him . "
He finally got word from his sister on April 23 that the message had been received , according to the affidavit .
" I just talked to your Fixer guy , " his sister said .
" He told me to tell you that everything 's been good , do n't worry about it . "
" I have n't seen or heard anything that in my opnion amounts to obstruction of justice for my client , " said John Nicholson , a federal public defender representing McGraw , in a telephone interview Friday .
" But that 's not for me to decide , and it 's not for the prosecutor to decide .
That 's for the judge to decide . "
McGrew , the security researcher , has " gone out of his way to engage these ETA people , " Nicholson added .
" He talks about the case on his blog all the time .
It 's my understanding that he taught aspects of this case in his class .
He communicates voluntarily with members of the ETA . "
As GhostExodus , McGraw was a colorful figure who once shot a YouTube video of himself staging an " infiltration " mission at an office building , in which he 's seen skulking through the halls and installing RxBot on a desktop computer .
According to court records , ETA was building a modest botnet to attack a rival hacker gang .
In another video he displays his personal collection of infiltration gear , including lock picks , a cellphone jammer and fake FBI credentials .
Both videos turned out to be shot at the Northern Central Medical Plaza in Dallas , where he worked as a night security guard and had free run of the building .
While the videos suggest McGraw was something less than a grave danger to cyberspace , FBI agents took his antics seriously when they learned he'd installed a backdoor in the HVAC unit .
A failure of the unit could have affected hospital patients in the middle of a hot Texas summer , or caused drugs and other medical supplies to go bad , according to the bureau .
McGraw 's sentencing in the hospital case is set for September 16 in Dallas .

Is it environmentally efficient to wash all of our Ziploc bags for reuse , or do we use more resources than it is worth ?
And do the bags maintain their integrity for continuous washing , or does the hot water affect their chemical structure ?
— Econundrums reader Susan B .
I ’ve often wondered the same thing :
It ’d be nice to have an excuse to do away with the annoying task of washing and drying sandwich baggies .
Unfortunately , the poor Ziploc bag does n’t receive nearly as much attention as its politically polarizing cousin , the plastic grocery bag :
While countless studies have weighed the pros and cons of shopping bags , as far as I can tell , no one has ever published a single life - cycle analysis of the Ziploc baggie .
( SC Johnson , owner of the Ziploc brand , conducted one when they were formulating their new Evolve bag , but they did n’t share it with me . )
What we do know is that like grocery bags , most sandwich baggies are made of polyethylene , a substance derived from natural gas .
Although sandwich bags are smaller and denser than grocery bags , the two kinds actually weigh about the same : .01 pounds each .
So allow me a back - of - the - napkin calculation :
One study ( PDF ) showed that 58 gallons of water were required to produce 1500 plastic grocery bags — about .04 gallons of water per bag .
Let ’s say it takes you five seconds to wash out a baggie .
Since most kitchen faucets flow at about two gallons per minute , that ’s roughly .17 gallons of water per washing , or four times the amount required to make a new plastic bag .
But despite the water cost , the other benefits of reusing baggies — savings on raw materials , emissions from shipping , and landfill space — make washing worthwhile , says Darby Hoover , a senior resource specialist at the Natural Resources Defense Council .
“ When plastic bags are reused , fewer plastic bags need to be produced , ” writes Hoover .
“ The production of plastic bags uses energy , water , and in most cases a non-renewable resource ( fossil fuel - derived ) ; reusing bags , even when you use water to wash them out , saves resources overall . ”
As for using hot water for washing :
There ’s been some concern that chemicals from bags leach into foods at high temperatures ( and Ziploc does n’t recommend microwaving or boiling its standard sandwich bags ) , though I have n’t seen any studies about whether hot washing changes the chemical structure of a bag .
If you ’re worried , you could always use cold water and a little soap .
But “ if they change color or opacity , I ’d say that to be on the safe side , you should discontinue using them , ” warns Hoover .
“ I ’d also caution against reusing bags that have held raw meat , greasy food , or anything else that might be difficult to rinse out entirely . ”
Depending on where you live , you might be able to recycle old baggies .
Better yet :
You could invest in good quality reusable baggies instead .

General McChrystal Crosses The Line
General Stanley McChrystal is opening his mouth again and , this time , it could cost him his job .
Doug Mataconis · · 17 comments
General Stanley McChrystal is in some pretty hot water after giving what can only be called a bizarre interview to Rolling Stone :
KABUL —
The top U.S. general in Afghanistan apologized Tuesday for a magazine article that portrays him and his staff as flippant and dismissive of top Obama administration officials involved in Afghanistan policy .
The profile in Rolling Stone magazine , titled the “ Runaway General , ” is certain to increase tension between the White House and Gen. Stanley McChrystal .
It also raises fresh questions about the judgment and leadership style of the commander Obama appointed last year in an effort to turn around a worsening conflict .
McChrystal and some of his senior advisors are quoted criticizing top administration officials , at times in starkly derisive terms .
An anonymous McChrystal aide is quoted calling national security adviser James Jones a “ clown . ” Referring to Richard Holbrooke , Obama ’s senior envoy to Afghanistan and Pakistan , one McChrystal aide is quoted saying : “ The Boss says he ’s like a wounded animal .
Holbrooke keeps hearing rumors that he ’s going to get fired , so that makes him dangerous . ”
On one occasion , McChrystal appears to react with exasperation when he receives an e-mail from Holbrooke , saying , “ Oh , not another e-mail from Holbrooke .
I do n’t even want to read it . ” U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan Karl Eikenberry , a retired three - star general , is n’t spared .
Referring to a leaked cable from Eikenberry that expressed concerns about the trustworthiness of Afghan President Hamid Karzai , McChrystal is quoted as having said : “ Here ’s one that covers his flank for the history books .
Now if we fail , they can say , ‘ I told you so . ' ”
A U.S. embassy spokeswoman said she had no immediate comment on the piece .
The magazine hits newsstands Friday .
The Washington Post received an advance copy from the profile ’s author , Michael Hastings , a freelance journalist who has written for the Post .
“ I extend my sincerest apology for this profile , ” McChrystal said in a statement issued Tuesday morning .
“ It was a mistake reflecting poor judgment and it should have never happened . ”
Here are a few highlights , if that ’s the right word , from the interview :
On Joe Biden : “ Are you asking about Vice President Biden ? ” McChrystal reportedly joked .
“ Who ’s that ? ” (…)
On Jim Jones : Another aide reportedly called White House National Security Adviser Jim Jones , a retired four star general , a “ clown ” who was “ stuck in 1985 . ”
On Richard Holbrooke : “ The boss says he ’s like a wounded animal , ” one of the general ’s aides was quoted as saying .
“ Holbrooke keeps hearing rumors that he ’s going to get fired , so that makes him dangerous . ”
On Obama : “ Obama clearly did n’t know anything about him , who he was .
The boss was pretty disappointed , ” the adviser told the magazine .
MSNBC is reporting this morning that McChrystal has been summoned to Washington for a meeting in the White House Situation Room that is likely to be even more tense than his Air Force One meeting with President Obama only six months ago .
This is n’t the first time that McChrystal ’s outspokenness has seemed to stray very close to the line of insubordination , of course .
Last year , a report he wrote for the Joint Chiefs that was supposed to have been confidential was leaked to the public , some news sources reported that McChrystal had threatened to resign if the President did not grant him all the troops he requested , McChrystal allowed himself to be dragged into an absurd conservative blog meme about how many times he had met with the President , and McChrystal made a very public speech in London criticizing the Administration .
As James wrote at New Atlanticist at the time of that last incident :
This is n’t exactly Douglas MacArthur territory .
Obama has yet to outline a competing strategic vision and McChrystal is essentially just making a full - throated defense of the doctrine he was sent to carry out .
But it does put his commander - in - chief in a rather awkward position .
His approach is at stark contrast to that of Kip Ward , commander of United States Africa Command , who repeatedly deflected questions about strategic priorities in his Atlantic Council appearance earlier in the week .
Each time such a query was posed , he simply noted that he takes his orders from the president and the secretary of defense .
Somewhere in between these tacks strikes me as the proper mode for four - star commanders .
They should work within the commander ’s intent — which in McChrystal ’s case means that of CENTCOM chief David Petraeus as well as the president and SECDEF — but also use their professionaljudgment in how best to carry out their mission .
When it ’s obvious that the president and his senior advisors are seriously considering a major policy change , however , it ’s probably best for the generals to provide their inputs in private to avoid giving the appearance of undermining civilian control of policy .
That was then , of course .
Now , I think things are different .
This time , McChrystal is openly criticizing his civilian superiors , including not only the President but , according to summaries of the article , the Vice - President , the Ambassador to Afghanistan , and the National Security Advisor .
Does this stray into MacArthur territory ?
Well , it sure as heck comes close .
What happens to McChrystal at this point is up to Obama , but given the General ’s public statements it ’s hard for me to see how the White House and Pentagon can keep him in place .
This is insubordination , and there ’s really only one appropriate response .
Update : Via Mark Halperin , here is the complete article .

Wade thinks there 's a clear favorite for the 2011 NBA championship .
No , it 's not the Miami Heat .
Even after Wade signed a new six - year deal and had LeBron James and Chris Bosh added to the Miami mix , the 2006 NBA Finals MVP says the two - time defending champion Los Angeles Lakers should be the favorites heading into next season , simply because this Heat team has n't proved anything yet .
" The Lakers are the champions and we know the Lakers are very good , " Wade said Wednesday at a golf tournament he co-hosts with Alonzo Mourning .
" That 's the team that everyone 's shooting for and they should be .
Not the Miami Heat .
The Los Angeles Lakers . "
Oddsmakers in Las Vegas disagree , with some sports books establishing Miami -- a 20 - 1 pick before Wade , James and Bosh signed -- as an 8 - 5 choice to win next season 's title .
Wade said he still can't believe Miami pulled off the coup of free agency , luring James and Bosh to join him .
And he said he 's proud not to be the highest - paid player on the Heat , with James and Bosh signing deals worth around $ 111 million , while Wade took about $ 107 million for the next six seasons .
Wade took less , in part , to ensure Miami had enough money to re-sign Udonis Haslem , his close friend and teammate for the last seven years .
" We got the big three , " Wade said , " and now we 've got to continue to build our team . "
He credited James with successfully recruiting center Zydrunas Ilgauskas , who announced Tuesday that he 'll leave Cleveland after more than a decade and sign with the Heat this week .
Wade expects free agent sharpshooter Mike Miller , who made 48 percent of his 3 - pointers last season , to sign in the coming days .
Miller agreed in principle several days ago to a deal that remains unsigned .
Plus , several players have contacted Wade to see if the Heat has space for them on the roster .
" The hard part is out of the way , " Wade said .
" Trust me , I get a lot of messages from a lot of different guys that want to be a part of this .
But it 's about putting the right guys in the right situation .
Everyone might not have the personality to deal with this .
It 's got to be the right mix .
The locker room has to be right .
We 've got to be patient to build this team . "
If an effort to combat his state 's swelling budget deficit , Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger is requiring all state workers to take off three days per month , without pay .
The move is an about face on the Governor 's previous retraction of the state 's furlough policy , according to the Sacramento Bee .
There are certain exemptions to this rule , however .
If your department brings in revenue , like the Franchise Tax board , you do not get the forced leave .
Also , if you are a union member , this may not apply .
This is the third time Governor Schwarzenegger has acted in this manner , to reduce state worker pay , without legislative support , according to The Bee .
A unique memorial for a woman killed in Israel is bound for Gaza .
An Irish cargo ship is bound for Gaza , just days after Israeli commandos stormed a flotilla of six ships , killing nine and arresting those on board who said they were on a humanitarian mission to deliver supplies to the impoverished territory .
No one knows what will happen when the 19 activists and crew members aboard the MV Rachel Corrie reach Israel ’s naval Gaza blockade , but the ship ’s name calls to memory the woman for whom it is named .
Rachel Corrie was a 23 - year - old American from Olympia , Wash . , who was crushed to death by an Israeli Army bulldozer March 16 , 2003 .
Corrie was in the Gaza Strip , working with the International Solidarity Movement , which opposes Israel ’s occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip , and living among Palestinians whose homes were being demolished .
She was kneeling in front of a home , acting as a human shield , when she was bulldozed .
The Israeli Army called the killing a “ very regrettable accident , ” and said the driver of the bulldozer had not seen Corrie .
Members of the International Solidarity Movement said “ there was nothing to obscure the driver ’s view . ”
Corrie was wearing a bright orange jacket when she was crushed .

In his article about state management in Clojure , Rich Hickey discusses his reasons for choosing not to use the Erlang - style actor model .
While Erlang has made some implementation choices that can lead to problems , the problems are not intrinsic to the Actor Model .
As the actor implementation with the longest history of success , Erlang naturally represents many peoples ’ understanding of the nature of actors — just as Smalltalk represents many peoples ’ understanding of objects .
Patterns for actor - based problem solving are still emerging , but my experience with programming actors - in - the - small ( i.e. : fine - grained concurrency in a shared - memory multicore context ) leads me to believe that there is great potential for this largely - misunderstood model .
So with that in mind , let ’s break down Rich ’s reasons and address them one - at - a - time .
It is a much more complex programming model , requiring 2 - message conversations for the simplest data reads , and forcing the use of blocking message receives , which introduce the potential for deadlock .
Erlang ’s nested ( blocking ) receive is not part of Hewitt ’s original actor model [ 1 ] or Agha ’s elaboration of it [ 2 ] .
By introducing such a mechanism , a kind of deadlock can occur in Erlang .
Of course , Erlang provides additional mechanisms , such as time - outs and supervision trees , for handling these failures .
In the context of fault - tolerant components and distributed systems these mechanisms are very useful for creating reliable systems , but they are not required for shared - memory multiprocessing .
The actor model does require two messages to “ read ” data from an object / actor — a request message and its corresponding reply .
This is actually what allows you to avoid blocking concurrent requests .
The messages are asynchronous , so nothing really needs to be blocked .
If the requestor is unable to proceed without the data from the reply , then the requestor may be logically blocked , but that is not a result of using actors , it ’s a result of the pattern of interaction used in a particular design .
In most cases , there is much more potential concurrency to exploit in a particular system .
Results may not even be “ returned ” to the requestor .
Instead , results can be directed to the object / actor that needs the data .
This leads to more of a flow - based approach to decomposing the system .
Data flows asynchronously and concurrently to where it is needed .
The actors in the system simply react to the arrival of new information in the form of messages representing work to do .
Programming for the failure modes of distribution means utilizing timeouts etc .
It causes a bifurcation of the program protocols , some of which are represented by functions and others by the values of messages .
The key idea here is to focus on the protocol of messages .
Think of “ protocol ” as a replacement for “ interface ” in designing loosely - coupled components .
Components that can speak the same protocol can be used interchangeably and even safely upgraded or hot - swapped .
Having appropriate strategies and mechanisms for handling distributed failure modes makes it possible to build extremely reliable and resilient systems .
Erlang provides many valuable patterns for addressing these issues .
However , these mechanisms are not required for communication within the same address space and are not intrinsic to the actor model .
The bifurcation encouraged by actor - based programming is between values and actors .
Values remain constant over time .
Actors may change their behavior based on messages ( values ) they receive , so they represent the changable state of the system .
Clojure encourages just the same bifurcation .
Most of the language deals with values and functions on values .
The “ identity ” concept is used to represent the changable state of the system .
It does n’t let you fully leverage the efficiencies of being in the same process .
It is quite possible to efficiently directly share a large immutable data structure between threads , but the actor model forces intervening conversations and , potentially , copying .
The actor model does not force copying of data .
Passing messages between address spaces is what forces copying .
Actor model messages are always pure immutable data values , and thus can be safely shared within an address space .
An efficient actor implementation will fully leverage the ability to share large immutables values ( data structures ) among multiple actors .
When copying must occur ( e.g. : between machines ) then it happens safely and transparently , since neither the original nor the copy are allowed to change .
Reads and writes get serialized and block each other , etc .
Actors implement a “ shared nothing ” data model .
If you create an actor that has stateful behavior ( such as a “ storage cell ” ) then — and only then — you must define a protocol for access .
Since messages are asynchronous , a sender never really blocks , not even to wait for the message to be received .
If a response is generated , it is sent as a separate asynchronous message to whatever customer is specified in the request ( which may not be the requestor ) .
If there is a problem with “ blocking ” then either the protocol is poorly designed or the problem inherently requires synchronization .
If synchronization is really needed , there are several good protocol patterns available .
You ’re not limited to the intrinsic synchronization assumed by sequential processing and call - return procedural protocols .
It reduces your flexibility in modeling – this is a world in which everyone sits in a windowless room and communicates only by mail .
On the contrary !
The actor model is flexible enough to model the mechanisms of practically any other model of computation , including functional , logical , procedural and object - oriented .
The basic mechanisms of the actor model , asynchronous communication of pure values among concurrent components , and dynamic reconfiguration of state , provides a reliable and well - defined semantic foundation .
Thinking differently about the structure of your programs is required for scalable concurrent programming .
Fortunately , we have examples all around us .
The real world is concurrent .
Change requires interaction .
State is only observable through behavior .
The actor model gives us the tools to represent this directly in our designs .
Programs are decomposed as piles of blocking switch statements .
This is specific to Erlang , which implements actors as tail - recursive functions that block on “ receive ” .
But that is not the only possible implementation .
Hewitt / Agha - style actors have no explicit “ receive ” .
Instead , they are activated by the reception of a message .
The behavior they execute on activation is finite , and they can not block .
In fact , there are really no “ threads ” at all .
Only reactive components that maintain their ( passive ) state between invocations ( messages ) .
All pending work in the system is represented by messages - in - transit .
You can only handle messages you anticipated receiving .
And objects ( in a traditional object - oriented language ) can only handle messages they anticipated receiving .
But both objects and actors can be designed to delegate “ unanticipated ” messages to another handler .
Are all functions in Clojure “ total ” , or are they undefined for some “ unanticipated ” input values ?
In Humus , actors can choose to ignore , modify , redirect , or throw an exception when they receive a message they do n’t want to handle directly .
Coordinating activities involving multiple actors is very difficult .
Programming with actors does require a different mental model , just like programming with functions , logic , procedures , or objects .
That ’s what makes it a model of computation , not just a new set of tools and patterns we can capture in a library .
You should expect that a shift to actor - based thinking will be as much of a challenge as shifting to any new computational model .
You ca n’t observe anything without its cooperation / coordination – making ad - hoc reporting or analysis impossible , instead forcing every actor to participate in each protocol .
Two powerful mechanisms are available to address this issue .
First , actors can be easily hidden behind proxies , adapters , or even a façade .
Since you can only interact with an actor through its message protocol , you can interpose all kinds of reporting and analysis actors without the knowledge or consent of either the customers or the target actor .
All kinds of aspects , monitoring , instrumentation , verification , and adaptation can be implemented this way .
Second , actors can be hosted in a heavily - instrumented meta-configuration which records the full history of all messages and the provenance of all actors in the configuration .
The resulting event - trees can be combined with references to the actors ’ behaviors for a full picture of any given execution .
You ca n’t get more observable than that .
It is often the case that taking something that works well locally and transparently distributing it does n’t work out – the conversation granularity is too chatty or the message payloads are too large or the failure modes change the optimal work partitioning , i.e. transparent distribution is n’t transparent and the code has to change anyway .
Properly modularized actor configurations can be distributed , and often replicated , without changing their fundamental operation .
This does not make distribution “ transparent ” , partly for the reasons quoted .
However , distributed programming is not the only application for actors .
Safe concurrent applications , even on multiple processor cores sharing memory , can be created with actors .
And extremely efficient actor implementations do exist .
Conclusion
I have nothing against Clojure .
In fact , I think there are a lot of interesting ideas there .
Focusing mostly on pure functions and providing explicit mechanisms for handling mutable state is a good idea .
In a future article , I intend to explore the implementation of Software Transactional Memory , another interesting idea .
I also respect the choice to not support actors .
However , I do object to some of the reasons given for making that design decision .
This rebuttal is intended to provide a counterpoint to Rich Hickey ’s rationale and hopefully dispel some of the misconceptions relating to actor implementations .

Within two weeks , the French newspaper Le Monde will run out of cash .
By this Monday at noon , candidates to the takeover of the most prestigious French daily will have disclosed their offers .
By June 28 , the staff will vote and make the final decision for the fate of the 66 years - old paper .
More importantly , the newspaper ’s independence will be under severe pressure .
Le Monde is the textbook example of the evolution of French press over the last years :
A steady erosion in readership .
A lack of budget discipline , made worse by loose governance .
The core newsroom ’s reluctance to support the digital strategy
The collective certainty the “ brand ” was too beautiful to fail and that a deep - pocketed philanthropist will inevitably show up at the right time to save the company .
An difficulty to invest into the future , to test new ideas , to built prototypes , to coopt key talent or to invest in decisive technologies .
A bottomless investment in the heavy - industry part of the supply chain , in costly printing facilities .
An excessive reliance on public subsidies which account for about 10 % of the industry ’s entire revenue .
Compared to Sweden , French newspapers have 3 times less readers , but each one gets 5 times more subsidies .
To a large extent , these characteristics are shared by most French newspapers .
This could explain the dire situation of the Gallic press .
As of today , four major properties are on the block , or urgently looking for saviors :
Le Monde seeks at least € 100 m ( for a first round ) .
Le Parisien , a popular daily , is for sale ; although quite good from an editorial perspective , it is not profitable and its family ownership wants to refocus on sports - related assets .
La Tribune , the n°2 business daily , is looking for a majority investor .
Liberation is also facing a cash stress .
Le Monde ’s situation is by far the most critical and the most emblematic .
Here are the key elements :
In 2009 , the Groupe Le Monde had a revenue of €390 m , an operating profit of € 2.2 m , and a net loss of € 25 m .
It is crumbling under € 100 m in debt , the result of a failed acquisition strategy .
Its arcane shareholder structure includes Lagardère Group for 17 % ; the Spanish group Prisa ( owner of El Pais ) for 15 % ; the newsmagazine Le Nouvel Observateur for 5 % ; its staff for 22 % and various other entities for the rest .
Its main assets are :
The daily Le Monde and its weekly magazine ; Le Monde Interactif ( including Le Monde.fr ) ; three other magazines ; and a printing plant .
Over the last three years , it looked like this :
Over the last fifteen years , Le Monde ’s management proved unable to come up with a cogent strategy .
The group tried to expand into the regional press and into the magazine sectors without any coherence behind such moves .
The only tangible achievement was the creation of Le Monde Interactif , this against most of an internet - adverse newsroom .
In fact , Le Monde ’s digital unit had to handle 34 % of its ownership to the Lagardère Group in order to get sufficient funding .
The group ’s current valuation reflects the state of the different business units .
Calyon , an investment bank , valued Le Monde Interactif at € 67 m , the magazines and the printing plant at € 63 m , and the newspaper itself at … € 10 m !
An absurd valuation considering that most of of Le Monde ’s editorial firepower still lies in the paper ’s newsroom .
Until recently , management was highly confident : Le Monde would easily find fresh capital .
Five potential investors were considering a bid .
Outside of France , there were the Italian group L’Espresso led by the industrial magnate Carlo de Benedetti ; the Swiss group Ringier ; Groupo Prisa from Spain .
On the French side , the two major contenders were Claude Perdriel , owner of the weekly newsmagazine Le Nouvel Observateur ; and a group of three private investors combining Matthieu Pigasse , head of the investment bank Lazard in France , Pierre Bergé co-founder of the fashion house Yves Saint - Laurent and has a long history of financing left - leaning lost editorial causes ( he was close to the late socialist president François Mitterrand ) , and Xavier Niel , a highly successful telecommunication entrepreneur whose net worth is north of € 2bn .
The five were said to be ready to commit € 80 – 100 m to get a majority stake in Groupe Le Monde .
Then two things happened : the opening of the data room and the interference of French politics .
The electronic data room opened about a month ago .
After few days of number crunching and legal analysis , two of the big media groups , Ringier and L’Espresso withdrew .
Ringier found out Le Monde ’s situation was far worse than expected with a € 200 m cash need .
Gruppo De Benedetti opined a bankruptcy filing was required , before anything else , in order to clear up the debt .
Among other things , potential liabilities at the printing plant are worrisome : it ’ll lose roughly 30 to 40 % of its revenue this year ; it needs both a major upgrade and a severe downsizing of its heavily unionized workforce .
In France , firing a printing plant employee is hugely expensive .
The gent is paid € 50,000 per year , works 32 hours per week and 164 days per year .
Firing him costs about € 466,000 — that ’s a French government estimate , it ( we … ) might pick part of the tab .
Combined with the mandatory modernization of the plant , the workforce downsizing was to add about € 50 m to the bill .
Others dark discoveries such as massive off - balance - sheet liabilities discouraged the foreign suitors .
As for the Spanish group Prisa , it asked to postpone the deadline to September , a request denied by Le Monde as it faces a short - term cash crisis .
In itself , the withdrawal of three serious media concerns had to be seen as a further warning of Le Monde ’s dire predicament .
It did n’t discourage French bidders .
For the triumvirate led by the Lazard partner and financed by the telecommunication Niel and fashion tycoon Bergé , this development was n’t to change anything .
They can handle a sharp rise in the required funding .
This did n’t turn out to be the case for Claude Perdriel , the Nouvel Observateur owner .
At 84 , this wealthy businessman made a fortune in high - end bathroom fixtures .
In 1977 , he launched Le Matin de Paris , a modern , cleverly designed newspaper , whose main purpose was to support François Mitterrand ’s presidential bid .
Once the socialist settled at the Elysée palace , Le Matin unabashed support made it increasingly irrelevant , it folded in 1987 .
This explains Claude Perdriel ’s desire to put his hands on Le Monde .
But with the prospect of an ever increasing price for the prize , Perdriel quickly realized he needed some backup ( he should have known , he sat on Le Monde ’s board , after all ) .
Perdriel first found help in Stephane Richard , the newly appointed CEO of France Telecom , the country n°1 telco that includes the ISP and mobile carrier Orange .
Richard intends to make two moves : first , take over at least a third of Le Monde ’s digital unit by buying the 34 % stake owned by Lagardère ; second , to invest at the group level .
A minor detail : Orange ’s main shareholder remains the French government , with a 26 % ownership .
And this Sunday June 20th , after a last ditch effort , the Perdriel - Orange duo announced it has been able to reintegrate the Spanish group Prisa in its bid .
Two weeks ago , Nicolas Sarkozy jumped into the fray .
The French president summoned Le Monde ’s CEO Eric Fottorino to express his view on the battle for the paper .
The President loathed the bid from the trio Pigasse - Bergé - Niel .
Xavier Niel , he said , is a bad idea ; classy as always , the head of State called him a “ peep - show man ” , referring to Niel ’s early activities in Minitel “ personal ” services ( Claude Perdriel made a fortune in the very same business ) .
But Niel ’s early days are the least of Sarkozy ’s problem .
He sees the self - made entrepreneur as an uncontrollable maverick backing two anti-sarkozy websites : Bakchich and Mediapart .
For the media control - freak Sarkozy , the thought of having the Niel crew taking over Le Monde is an unbearable one .
With Perdriel , at least , he wo n’t wander in unchartered territories ; and since the Nouvel Obs owner is a bit short in cash , he ’ll have to rely on the government - friendly Orange .
Here we are .
Two years before the next presidential election , Le Monde ’s independence is clearly at stake .
Of course , it is highly unlikely to see the new owner ’s representatives getting involved in editorial choices .
Things usually work on a subtler , more pernicious way .
On the Perdriel - Orange side , in a self - granted interview , Denis Olivennes , Le Nouvel Observateur ’s publisher let it be known he wanted to create “ a center - left newspaper ” .
This vision of a news organization built on political agenda is passé , to say the least .
More importantly , with Orange as a backer , numerous subjects will become difficult to cover in Le Monde .
Orange spends about € 1 billion a year in contents : cinema , all forms of TV , broadcasting sports rights .
For any Le Monde journalist covering such topics will become very touchy … in addition to those at the core of Orange ’s businesses ( internet , mobile , infrastructure , regulation ) .
Again : Orange people wo n’t interfere with the coverage , but reader perception will be tainted ( not to mention self - censorship , a plague in French newsrooms ) .
To prevent such suspicion , it was crucial to secure the moral backing of El Pais owners , hence this weekend ’s intense discussions .
As for the Pigasse - Bergé - Niel trio , the presence of Lazard France ’boss Matthieu Pigasse is not likely to lighten the ambience .
First of all , Pigasse is said to have political ambitions ( see his profile by Reuters here ) ; he is close to IMF managing director Dominique Strauss - Kahn ( a likely presidential candidate for 2012 ) ; he is involved in various think - tanks ; he was an adviser to a center - something candidate during the last presidential election .
Pigasse is cozy and charming with journalists , and cultivates the oxymoronic image of a cool - banker by owning a rock and roll magazine .
Second problem : should Pigasse and his associates get Le Monde , Lazard ’s involvement in many sectors will raise questions .
For instance : Lazard has been retained by the Greek government as an advisor on its public finances ; the Paris - based sovereign debt division of Lazard is also helping countries such as Argentina , Ecuador , Ivory Coast , Kazakhstan .
Not to mention the bank implications with many Fortune 500 companies .
Already , big PR firms are sharpening their knives and are ready to discredit Le Monde if their clients come under attack .
At some point , Mr. Pigasse will have to choose between his banking , political and media ambitions .
What does Le Monde need now ?
Four things ( at least ) .
A project .
Both editorial and industrial .
Editorially speaking , Le Monde needs to turn up its competitive metabolism , to muscle sections such as the business coverage , and to better integrate its website in a strategically planned approach of the news .
A restructuring .
Assets such as the magazine Telerama have to be sold ( as long as there is a buyer ) .
The printing plant will have to be shut down and the print load transferred to Le Figaro which has built a modern facility that can handle Le Monde print run .
A decisive human resources initiative .
Like in every newsroom , there are huge imbalances in the staff workloads , which creates frustration and bitterness .
On average , a journalist at Le Monde works 15 % to 20 % less than its counterpart at the Guardian or El Pais .
This has to be adjusted through a fair ( but delicate ) labor negotiation .
Actually , the Prisa group wanted to address this issue rather bluntly .
A long term approach .
In any case , Le Monde ’s renovation will take years .
On this aspect , Claude Perdriel ’s bid is not particularly appealing ; at 84 , he is not likely to stay at the top for long , and after him lies an uncertain future — especially when the restructuring will require additional funding .
The Niel - Bergé - Pigasse team claims to have more of a long term approach ( and deeper pockets ) .
As long as it is able to refrain from using Le Monde to push political agendas or careers , as long as the newsroom can be protected against conflicts of interest — and that ’s two big ifs — their bid could bring a more stable future for Le Monde .
Le Monde remains a great news organization , both in print and online .
It might become irrelevant within a few short years if its new owners want to use it for their interests or goals .
Otherwise , if proper steps are taken , it has the potential to be an editorial powerhouse comparable to the Guardian or The New York Times .
This is what is at stake today .

We can all recall the school yard bully and loud mouth .
They were the actor who played out the scenes contrived by others because of the reinforcing attention which came their way .
While this person received all of the attention and appeared to be acting alone , the fact - of - the - matter was they were really too cowardly to act independently .
So in march the congressional twins of Iowa , Steve King and Tom Latham .
Steve King opens his mouth , and everyone thinks he is the only bad boy from Iowa , when in fact , Tom Latham is in cahoots all the way .
Steve King calls President Obama racist , but it is not just King ’s hands that are dirty .
He has a partner in crime , and if you do n’t believe it , go to http://www.ontheissues.org and check out their civil rights voting records .
Better yet — ask Tom Latham to publically disavow and condemn King ’s statement .
As the voting records will support , Tom Latham is just the silent partner in this team .
As shameful as Steve King 's behavior is , at least he lets us know just where he stands .
Tom Latham , on the other hand , chooses to work from the shadows .
We all knew people like him in school .
Just like those we knew in school , Tom Latham counts on people to pay attention to the one who acts out .
He counts on people to remain oblivious to what is really behind his smile .
Well , the day of reckoning is coming , and it is time for the voters to say loud and clear to Tom Latham , " We wo n’t be fooled again ! "
There is no place in our country for bigotry and discrimination .
Tom Latham ’s voting record on a full range of issues validates the kinship between him and Steve King .
It is time to send Tom Latham packing and elect someone dedicated to the realization of economic and social justice !

The Keynesian clown hit parade just keeps on rolling .
Leo Kolivakis at Pension Pulse is the latest to put on the clown hat for The Third Depression ?
Some economists are worried about the push to slash deficits too early .
In his op - ed piece in the NYT , Paul Krugman goes as far as calling for The Third Depression .
I also fear that policymakers are making a major mistake by moving so aggressively to cut deficits at a time when the global economy remains fragile .
If you go back in history and look at all the major recessions , they were preceded by major policy mistakes .
Either the Fed started raising rates too aggressively , or governments slashed spending too aggressively , or both .
The Cause of Depressions
What causes depressions is an unsustainable runup in credit and debt that precedes it , NOT a failure to go deeper in debt .
Three Examples of Total Rubbish
People who think crack addicts can smoke crack to cure their addiction
Alcoholics who think they can drink their way out of alcoholism
Debt junkies ( and Keynesian clowns ) who think one can spend one 's way out of a spending problem
Depression is Well Earned

The cuts are likely to mean fewer support services for students
Thousands of people working for universities in England could lose their jobs if ministers press ahead with 25 % funding cuts , a union warns .
Analysis by the University and College Union concluded that 22,584 jobs - academic and otherwise - would be lost .
It warned that the quality of students ' university experience would be reduced .
Chancellor George Osborne announced in last month 's Budget that government departments whose budgets are ring - fenced would face spending cuts of 25 % .
This includes the Department for Business , Innovation and Skills ( Bis ) which oversees universities .
The union said 10,163 academic staff could be at risk and 12,421 jobs in areas such as IT support , libraries , student counselling , careers advice , press offices and catering could be axed .
The sector currently employs the equivalent of nearly 262,000 full - time employees , the union said .
The UCU said its estimates were " conservative " and the impact of funding cuts could be worse .
Calculations
When making its calculations , the union took the £ 6.65 bn allocated to universities for 2010 / 11 by the Higher Education Funding Council for England ( Hefce ) and calculated that a 25 % cut would equate to £ 1.66bn .
It then calculated that , with staff costs taking up an average of 57 % of universities '
Hefce grant , staff costs would be reduced by nearly £ 947m .
With the average wage for university workers standing at nearly £ 42,000 ( according to the annual survey of hours and earning compiled by the Office for National Statistics ) , the UCU arrived at its conclusion that 22,584 jobs would go .
But the union said the figure could be higher as universities would find it easier to cut staff than other costs , such as rent and fuel bills , which are relatively fixed .
Universities had already been told they must save £ 200 m this year , on top of savings totalling around £ 1bn over the next few years .
' Fewer support services '
UCU general secretary Sally Hunt said the scale of the cuts was " unprecedented " and would have an " undeniable impact on the student experience " .
" Student to staff ratios , which are already high , will become some of the highest in the developed world , " she said .
" Lecturers that survive the cull will have less time to give individual students as they pick up the workloads of former colleagues and there will be fewer support services for students .
" The government will effectively be asking students to pay more for less at a time when our international competitors are investing in higher education . "
The president of the National Union of Students , Aaron Porter , said lower staff to student ratios would lead to a worsening experience for students .
" It would be outrageous for the government to consider asking them to pay even more to get a university education especially if quality is worsening .
" Graduates will be the drivers of our economic recovery and cutting student numbers will inevitably lead to a poorer standard of education .
" We currently have a world leading education system but if the government undervalues it we will lose the innovation and diverse skills that the UK economy is built on . "
The Pope continues to face allegations of his prior knowledge of abuse by clergy .
However , the most striking story in the article below is how Cardinal Dario Castrillon Hoyos allegedly heralded a bishop for his willingness to go to jail rather than reveal information about a priest accused of raping a child .
Here is the passage that stood out :
Cardinal Dario Castrillon
Hoyos , a Colombian who for 10 years was in charge of the Vatican department that supervises the clergy , wrote in 2001 with gushing approval to the Bishop of Bayeux , who went to jail rather than give French authorities information about a priest who had raped a minor .
“ I congratulate you for not turning in a priest to the civil administration . . .
I am delighted to have a colleague … who … has preferred prison to turning in his son-priest . ”
If true , that is an astonishing example of the cultural hostility toward these victims .
An invitation for the Cardinal was withdrawn recently due to the allegations against him .

DIYARBAKIR , Turkey —
The shadow of war is again hanging heavily over Turkey .
After breaking a 14 - month ceasefire this June , the Kurdistan Workers ’ Party has stepped up bomb attacks and attacks on the Turkish military .
At least 100 fighters , including 30 Turkish soldiers , have been killed over the past few weeks — many more than the casualties reported from the Afghan war for the same period .
“ This is about to explode big time , ” said Henri Barkey , a visiting scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington .
“ It ’s going to be messy and it ’s going to be all over the country . ”
For three decades the Kurdistan Party has fought — initially for an independent state , but now its leaders say they merely want language rights , enhanced local autonomy and amnesty for its fighters — in a conflict that has cost the lives of some 40,000 people .
The crisis is dividing Turkey between those who hold out hope for a democratic solution and those who , increasingly disillusioned after the failure of last summer ’s so - called “ democratic opening ” — a reform initiative designed to deal with the decades - old Kurdish insurrection — believe the rising cycle of violence is unlikely to stop .
Banners that read , “ Let guns be silenced for peace and brotherhood , ” written in both Turkish and Kurdish , filled Istanbul ’s central Istiklal Street this weekend as hundreds of activists gathered to protest the mounting bloodshed .
Meanwhile , packed military vehicles traverse the soft hills of Turkey ’s mainly Kurdish southeast , carrying troops to border posts or checkpoints .
Overhead , F - 16 fighter jets frequent the skies .
“ There is no magic wand , ” said Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan in an address to Parliament this week .
“ If we look at it as merely a question of security , we would be wrong .
We have done so for years .
The results are clear . ”
Since coming to power in 2002 , the governing Justice and Development Party has released a number of Kurdish political prisoners and eased the ban on Kurdish language and culture .
Their political overtures , however , have suffered from a lack of broad political consensus .
Devlet Behceli , an opposition leader , recently called Erdogan ’s softer policy a “ project of treason . ”
This past December the peace process was dealt a major blow when Turkey ’s constitutional court banned the pro-Kurdish Democratic Society Party because of its alleged links to the militants .
“ If you kick out all of the people in charge , who are you going to work towards a solution with ? ” asked Yeter , a young Kurdish woman who spent five years in prison outside of Diyarbakir .
The much - anticipated return last October of a group of Kurdish militants and supporters , who Erdogan had granted unofficial amnesty , has also turned soured .
The hero ’s welcome the group was given by thousands of Kurds on the Turkish side of the border turned the event into a political nightmare for the government and all 34 returnees , with the exception of four children , have now been charged with speaking in support of a terrorist organization .
“ The democratic initiative is not going anywhere .
It has come to a halt , deviated even , ” wrote Cengiz Candar , an influential newspaper columnist and veteran political analyst in a recent op - ed in the daily Hurriyet .
But while the government has vowed to continue their reforms , arguing that military action alone cannot solve a conflict rooted in calls from Turkey ’s Kurds for basic cultural and democratic rights , pressure is mounting for the government to respond forcefully in the face of escalating violence .
Turkish jets have been bombing targets in northern Iraq where the Kurdish militants are based with increasing regularity and the Turkish military has made efforts to step up its intelligence collaboration with the United States and Iraq .
Military checkpoints have been reintroduced in Turkey ’s southeast .
“ What we want is simple : constitutional recognition of our language , of our right to say ‘ Yes , I am a Kurd , ” said Gulistan , a young woman who has one brother fighting for the Kurdish rebels and another doing compulsory service in the Turkish army .
She preferred not to give her last name because of security concerns .
“ To reach peace , though , both sides much come to the table ; this can not be one - sided . ”
As democratic moves falter , the Kurdistan Worker ’s Party — considered a terrorist organization by Turkey , the United States and the EU — continues to carry a substantial support base in Diyarbakir and throughout the predominantly Kurdish southeast .
“ The state calls the PKK terrorists , but that is my husband , my brother , my cousin , ” said Mehtap , a woman of 39 - years with thick , dark hair and a quick laugh , as she sat at a cafe in central Diyarbakir .
“ But this much death ; it does n’t suit the young on either side . ”
Tens of thousands of Kurds have been arrested under Turkey ’s harsh anti-terror laws , including Mehtap , who was first imprisoned at the age of 14 .
She was only jailed for a few days but the time left its mark in the form of a broken jaw and bruises across her young body .
“ That ’s where I learned about politics , ” she said with a grim smile .
For the first time since the measure was shelved last year , Turkey ’s parliament began debating on Tuesday an amendment to soften anti-terror laws , which have been used to arrest some 1,500 Kurdish politicians and activists .
Some see hope in such changes , arguing that the “ democratic opening , ” while greatly weakened , may not be dead just yet .
Are you an enthusiast who loves their Ubuntu Linux experience but still needs to use Windows programs ?
Here ’s how you can get the full Windows experience on Ubuntu with the free VMware Player .
Linux has become increasingly consumer friendly , but still , the wide majority of commercial software is only available for Windows and Macs .
Dual - booting between Windows and Linux has been a popular option for years , but this is a frustrating solution since you have to reboot into the other operating system each time you want to run a specific application .
With virtualization , you ’ll never have to make this tradeoff .
VMware Player makes it quick and easy to install any edition of Windows in a virtual machine .
With VMware ’s great integration tools , you can copy and paste between your Linux and Windows programs and even run native Windows applications side - by - side with Linux ones .
Getting Started
Download the latest version of VMware Player for Linux , and select either the 32 - bit or 64 - bit version , depending on your system .
VMware Player is a free download , but requires registration .
Sign in with your VMware account , or create a new one if you do n’t already have one .
VMware Player is fairly easy to install on Linux , but you will need to start out the installation from the terminal .
First , enter the following to make sure the installer is marked as executable , substituting version / build_number for the version number on the end of the file you downloaded .
chmod +x ./VMware -Player-version/build_number.bundle
Then , enter the following to start the install , again substituting your version number :
gksudo bash ./VMware -Player-version/build_number.bundle
You may have to enter your administrator password to start the installation , and then the VMware Player graphical installer will open .
Choose whether you want to check for product updates and submit usage data to VMware , and then proceed with the install as normal .
VMware Player installed in only a few minutes in our tests , and was immediately ready to run , no reboot required .
You can now launch it from your Ubuntu menu : click Applications \ System Tools \ VMware Player .
You ’ll need to accept the license agreement the first time you run it .
Welcome to VMware Player !
Now you can create new virtual machines and run pre-built ones on your Ubuntu desktop .
Install Windows in VMware Player on Ubuntu
Now that you ’ve got VMware setup , it ’s time to put it to work .
Click the Create a New Virtual Machine as above to start making a Windows virtual machine .
In the dialog that opens , select your installer disk or ISO image file that you want to install Windows from .
In this example , we ’re select a Windows 7 ISO .
VMware will automatically detect the operating system on the disk or image .
Click Next to continue .
Enter your Windows product key , select the edition of Windows to install , and enter your name and password .
You can leave the product key field blank and enter it later .
VMware will ask if you want to continue without a product key , so just click Yes to continue .
Now enter a name for your virtual machine and select where you want to save it .
Note :
This will take up at least 15 Gb of space on your hard drive during the install , so make sure to save it on a drive with sufficient storage space .
You can choose how large you want your virtual hard drive to be ; the default is 40 Gb , but you can choose a different size if you wish .
The entire amount will not be used up on your hard drive initially , but the virtual drive will increase in size up to your maximum as you add files .
Additionally , you can choose if you want the virtual disk stored as a single file or as multiple files .
You will see the best performance by keeping the virtual disk as one file , but the virtual machine will be more portable if it is broken into smaller files , so choose the option that will work best for your needs .
Finally , review your settings , and if everything looks good , click Finish to create the virtual machine .
VMware will take over now , and install Windows without any further input using its Easy Install .
This is one of VMware ’s best features , and is the main reason we find it the easiest desktop virtualization solution to use .
Installing VMware Tools
VMware Player does n’t include the VMware Tools by default ; instead , it automatically downloads them for the operating system you ’re installing .
Once you ’ve downloaded them , it will use those tools anytime you install that OS .
If this is your first Windows virtual machine to install , you may be prompted to download and install them while Windows is installing .
Click Download and Install so your Easy Install will finish successfully .
VMware will then download and install the tools .
You may need to enter your administrative password to complete the install .
Other than this , you can leave your Windows install unattended ; VMware will get everything installed and running on its own .
Our test setup took about 30 minutes , and when it was done we were greeted with the Windows desktop ready to use , complete with drivers and the VMware tools .
The only thing missing was the Aero glass feature .
VMware Player is supposed to support the Aero glass effects in virtual machines , and although this works every time when we use VMware Player on Windows , we could not get it to work in Linux .
Other than that , Windows is fully ready to use .
You can copy and paste text , images , or files between Ubuntu and Windows , or simply drag - and - drop files between the two .
Unity Mode
Using Windows in a window is awkward , and makes your Windows programs feel out of place and hard to use .
This is where Unity mode comes in .
Click Virtual Machine in VMware ’s menu , and select Enter Unity .
Your Windows desktop will now disappear , and you ’ll see a new Windows menu underneath your Ubuntu menu .
This works the same as your Windows Start Menu , and you can open your Windows applications and files directly from it .
By default , programs from Windows will have a colored border and a VMware badge in the corner .
You can turn this off from the VMware settings pane .
Click Virtual Machine in VMware ’s menu and select Virtual Machine Settings .
Select Unity under the Options tab , and uncheck the Show borders and Show badges boxes if you do n’t want them .
Unity makes your Windows programs feel at home in Ubuntu .
Here we have Word 2010 and IE8 open beside the Ubuntu Help application .
Notice that the Windows applications show up in the taskbar on the bottom just like the Linux programs .
If you ’re using the Compiz graphics effects in Ubuntu , your Windows programs will use them too , including the popular wobbly windows effect .
You can switch back to running Windows inside VMware Player ’s window by clicking the Exit Unity button in the VMware window .
Now , whenever you want to run Windows applications in Linux , you can quickly launch it from VMware Player .
Conclusion
VMware Player is a great way to run Windows on your Linux computer .
It makes it extremely easy to get Windows installed and running , lets you run your Windows programs seamlessly alongside your Linux ones .
VMware products work great in our experience , and VMware Player on Linux was no exception .

A large bruise on Jupiter was discovered by an amateur stargazer – Australian Anthony Wesley .
The mystery around the dark spot has been solved – it was caused by rogue asteroid and the collision would have been equal to several thousand nuclear bombs .
Australian Anthony Wesley was using a home - made telescope in the yard of his rural home in Murrumbateman , near Canberra , when he spotted the dark scar last year .
Mr Wesley said that he had discovered the scar in between running inside to watch the final rounds of the British Open golf on television .
‘ I could n’t believe it .
I thought “ That was n’t there before ” and then I realised Jupiter had actually been hit by something , ’ he said at the time .

Modern marsupials may be popular animals at the zoo and in children 's books , but new findings by University at Buffalo biologists reveal that they harbor a " fossil " copy of a gene that codes for filoviruses , which cause Ebola and Marburg hemorrhagic fevers and are the most lethal viruses known to humans .
Published recently in the online journal BMC Evolutionary Biology , the paper demonstrates for the first time that mammals have harbored filoviruses for at least tens of millions of years , in contrast to the existing estimate of a few thousand .
It suggests that these species , which maintain a filovirus infection without negative health consequences , could have selectively maintained these so - called " fossil " genes as a genetic defense .
The work has important implications for the development of potential human vaccines , as well as for the modeling of disease outbreaks and the discovery of emerging diseases , including new filoviruses .
" This paper identifies the first captured ' fossil ' copies of filovirus - like genes in mammalian genomes , " says Derek J. Taylor , PhD , associate professor of biological sciences in the UB College of Arts and Sciences and co-author .
" Our results confirm for the first time that several groups of mammals , including groups such as marsupials that never colonized Africa , have had an association with filoviruses . "
The UB co-authors say that if the rarely captured genes represent antiviral defenses or genomic scars from persistent infections , then the work opens up new possibilities for identifying reservoir species for filoviruses , which harbor the virus but remain asymptomatic .

" The reservoir for filovirus has remained a huge mystery , " says Jeremy A. Bruenn , PhD , UB professor of biological sciences and co-author .
" We need to identify it because once a filovirus hits humans , it can be deadly . "
When the UB researchers studied samples from the fur of a wallaby at the Buffalo Zoo and a brown bat caught on the UB campus , they found that the genomes of both animals as well as some other small mammals contain " fossil " copies of the gene for these deadly viruses , and thus could be candidate reservoir species for them .
" Who knew that the bats in the attic as well as modern marsupials harbored fossil gene copies of the group of viruses that is most lethal to humans , " asks Taylor .
The research also demonstrates a new mechanism by which different species of mammals can acquire genes , through non-retroviral integrated RNA viruses , which the UB scientists had previously identified in eukaryotes but was unknown in mammals .
The UB scientists note that it is well - known that RNA retroviruses , like HIV - AIDS , can be integrated into mammal genomes .

" But because filoviruses infect only the cytoplasm of cells and not the nucleus and because they have no means of making DNA copies that might be integrated into the genome -- as retroviruses do -- it was never thought gene transfer could occur between non-retroviral RNA viruses and hosts , " says Bruenn .
" This paper shows that it does and it may prove to be a far more general phenomenon than is currently known . "
The research also reveals that existing estimates that filoviruses originated in mammals a few thousand years ago were way off the mark .
" Our findings demonstrate that filoviruses are , at a minimum , between 10 million and 24 million years old , and probably much older , " says Taylor .
" Instead of having evolved during the rise of agriculture , they more likely evolved during the rise of mammals . "
In addition to Bruenn and Taylor , Robert W. Leach , scientific programmer at the Center for Computational Research in UB 's New York State Center of Excellence in Bioinformatics and Life Sciences , is a co-author on the paper .
The authors are actively involved with the Molecular Recognition in Biological Systems and Bioinformatics strategic strength identified as part of the UB2020 strategic planning process .
NEW DELHI , India —
When an Air India Express flight from Dubai overshot the runway in Mangalore , India , and burst into flames , killing 158 passengers and crew , the Indian press was abuzz with stories about airline safety , the national carrier 's recent troubles and its many mistakes .
But as names and passport numbers of the dead flashed on television screens across the country , another scandal was about to be exposed :
That of a fake passport racket .
It has come to the attention of authorities in the country that as many as 10 passengers on that flight in May may have been using fraudulent passports for their travel .
" There were various discrepancies in some of the passports of passengers , " said M.K. Lokesh , India 's ambassador to the United Arab Emirates .
" I would n't call it a racket , but there were some problems . "
Several apparent irregularities prompted an investigation .
Some of the addresses were clearly fabricated , and many of the photographs on the passports did n't match the people carrying them .
In the United Arab Emirates , 27 - year - old Shavanas Mammed Koya was shocked when relatives and neighbors started calling and offering condolences .
" All my friends here got calls from my relatives in India worried that I had died .
Fortunately , I had spoken to my wife in the morning , before the news of the crash emerged , so she knew I was all right , " he told the National , a newspaper published from the United Arab Emirates .
Koya 's passport number was listed against the name of a certain Abdul Samad , who died in the crash , but Koya had neither left the country nor had any plans to travel .
He lodged a complaint with the consulate , which has confirmed that he had not left the country and was the rightful owner of the passport in question .
Koya 's situation has shed light on a fairly well - established and well - known organized crime racket , the " Kasargod Embassy " in Kerala 's northern district .
The Embassy deals in fake and forged passports , providing them to poor workers in the Persian Gulf .
The forgers manipulate the passport by replacing the photograph and stamping it with various residence and visit visas that they then sell for about $ 1,360 .
Many employers in the United Arab Emirates sponsor and fly over their workers and then hold on to their passports as a form of security , to protect themselves from the workers fleeing to another job or another country .
While illegal , the practice is widespread , and many times , workers end up never getting back their passports .
The fake passport racket then enables not only workers from India to get to the Gulf in the first place but stranded workers abroad to come back to their countries .
According to local media reports , 39 of the passengers were from Kasargode in Kerala , and were likely poor migrants from the village .
Abdul Samad , who was traveling on Koya 's passport had been a casual worker in Dubai for over 19 years and was on his way back home for the first time in three years .
Because of the condition of the remains and the charring of the bodies , officials are doing DNA analysis on the bodies to confirm their identities .
While early newspaper reports suggested that this , along with the allegations of passport fraud , might have an impact on the compensation claims by the families , opposition leader in the Kerala assembly , Oommen Chandy told the media that as most of the victims belong to poor families , denying them the compensation " was not justifiable . "
In addition to the amount sanctioned by the state and federal government , the victims will get $ 145,000 from Air India , according to international aviation standards .
Authorities believe that the passport fraud case connected with this incident is small potatoes compared with what 's going on in the rest of the country .
They claim that not only are passports being fabricated , so are visas .
Valayar Ravi , the minister of Overseas Indian Affairs , who is on an official visit to the United Arab Emirates , told local media that passport fraud was a serious and prevalent issue that had been encountered before in the region .
In a letter to the Research Directorate dated April 17 , 2007 , an official from the Canadian High Commission in New Delhi wrote , " … to my knowledge there are no identity documents in India that are not altered or counterfeited frequently .
Even when we send them for verification we cannot be sure that the ' verifier ' has not been paid to tell us the document is genuine . "
The economics of the fraudulent passport business make this a desirable commodity to deal in .
The maximum fine for a " minor offense " under the Indian Passport Act is about $ 260 .
The sale of a fake passport , on the other hand , can fetch up to five times as much .
Not only are fake passports used to send workers abroad , but in the past , they 've also been used to traffic women and aid in terrorism .
While earlier the passports were produced and created from scratch , after measures to detect such passports were tightened , the racket now mainly adopts impersonation and photo substitution in the forging .
The original passports are mostly sourced from recruiting and travel agents who obtain them from clients approaching them for visas .
They sell the passports to the racketeers and tell their clients that they 've lost the documents .
According to a Times of India article , in the months of January and February 2010 , the Sahar police in Mumbai arrested as many as 124 people for involvement in fake passport and visa cases .
They told the Times of India that they usually detect two fake passport cases a day and that the incidents have been rising in the last few months .
As many as 10,000 fake passports — either completely forged or tampered with — have been confiscated over the past 16 years and are stored in three cupboards at the Sahar police station , according to the report .
The Air India incident has come at a time when United Arab Emirates officials have been trying to tighten security on the borders .
But as long as there are desperate workers , experts say , it 's unlikely there 'll be a drop in the passport forgery business .
PICATINNY ARSENAL , N.J. ( June 23 , 2010 ) --
The Army announced today it has begun shipping its new 5.56 mm cartridge , the M855A1 Enhanced Performance Round , to support warfighters in Afghanistan .
The new M855A1 round is sometimes referred to as " green ammo .
"
The new round replaces the current M855 5.56 mm cartridge that has been used by U.S. troops since the early 1980s .
The M855A1 resulted in a number of significant enhancements not found in the current round , officials said .
They explained these include improved hard - target capability , more dependable , consistent performance at all distances , improved accuracy , reduced muzzle flash and a higher velocity .
During testing , the M855A1 performed better than current 7.62 mm ball ammunition against certain types of targets , blurring the performance differences that previously separated the two rounds .
The projectile incorporates these improvements without adding weight or requiring additional training .
According to Lt. Col. Jeffrey K. Woods , the program 's product manager , the projectile is " the best general purpose 5.56 mm round ever produced .
" Woods said its fielding represents the most significant advancement in general purpose small caliber ammunition in decades .
The Enhanced Performance Round contains an environmentally - friendly projectile that eliminates up to 2,000 tons of lead from the manufacturing process each year in direct support of Army commitment to environmental stewardship .
Woods said the effort is a clear example of how " greening " a previously hazardous material can also provide extremely beneficial performance improvements .
Picatinny Arsenal 's Project Manager for Maneuver Ammunition Systems manages the M855A1 program .
Project Manager Chris Grassano called the fielding " the culmination of an Army enterprise effort by a number of organizations , particularly the Army Research Laboratory , Armament Research Development and Engineering Center , Program Executive Office for Ammunition and the Joint Munitions Command .
" The Army utilized advanced science , modeling and analysis to produce the best 5.56 mm round possible for the warfighter , " he said .
The M855A1 is tailored for use in the M - 4 weapon system but also improves the performance of the M - 16 and M - 249 families of weapons .
A true general - purpose round , the M855A1 exceeds the performance of the current M855 against the many different types of targets likely to be encountered in combat .
Prior to initial production , the EPR underwent vigorous testing .
Official qualification of the round consisted of a series of side - by - side tests with the current M855 .
Overall , the Army fired more than 1 million rounds to ensure the new cartridge met or exceeded all expectations .
The M855A1 is without question the most thoroughly tested small caliber round ever fielded , Woods said .
The Army has recently completed the Limited Rate Initial Production phase for the M855A1 and is beginning the follow - on full rate production phase where plans are to procure more than 200 millions rounds over the next 12 - 15 months .
The M855A1 Enhanced Performance Round is the first environmentally - friendly bullet resulting from a larger " greening " effort across the Army 's Small Caliber Ammunition programs .
Other greening efforts include 5.56 mm tracer , 7.62 mm ball and green primers .
Soldiers in Afghanistan will begin using the new , improved round this summer .
Flashback Friday .
Two of my favorite podcasts , Radio Lab and Quirks and Quarks , have stories bout how inertia and reliance on technology can inhibit our ability to find easy , cheap solutions to problems .
Story One
The first story , at Radio Lab , was about a nursing home in Düsseldorf , Germany .
As patients age , nursing homes risk that they will become disoriented and “ escape ” the nursing home .
Often , they are trying to return to homes in which they lived previously , desperate that their children , partners , or even parents are worried and waiting for them .
When they catch the escapee in time , the patient is often extremely upset and an altercation ensues .
If they do n’t catch them in time , the patient often hops onto public transportation and is eventually discovered by police .
The first outcome is unpleasant for everyone involved and the second outcome is very dangerous for the patient .
Most nursing homes fix this problem by confining patients who ’ve began to wander off to a locked ward .
An employee at the Benrath Senior Center came up with an alternative solution : a fake bus stop placed right outside of the front doors of the nursing home .
The fake bus stop does two wonderful things :
(1) The first thing a potential escapee does when they decide to “ go home ” is find a bus stop .
So , patients who take off usually get no further than the first bus stop that they see .
“ Where did Mrs. Schmidt go ? ” “ Oh , she ’s at the bus stop . ”
In practice , it worked tremendously .
This meant that many disoriented patients no longer needed to be kept in locked wards .
(2) The bus stop diffuses the sense of panic .
If a delusional patient decided that she needed to go home immediately because her children were all alone and waiting for her , the attendant did n’t need to restrain her or talk her out of it , she simply said , “ Oh , well … there ’s the bus stop . ”
The patient would go sit and wait .
Knowing that she was on her way home , she would relax and , given her diminished cognition , she would eventually forget why she was there .
A little while later the attendant could go out and ask her if she wanted to come in for tea .
And she would say , “ Ok . ”
Listening to this , I thought it was just about the most brilliant thing I ’d ever heard .
Story Two
The second story , from Quirks and Quarks , was regarding whether it is true that dogs can smell cancer .
It turns out that they can .
It appears that dogs can smell lots of types of cancer , but people have been working specifically with training them to detect melanomas , or skin cancers .
It turns out that a dog can be trained , in about three to six weeks , to detect melanomas ( even some invisible to the naked eye ) with an 80 - 90 % accuracy rate .
If we could build a machine that was able to detect the same chemical that dogs are reacting to ( and we do n’t know , at this time , what that is ) it would have to be the size of a refrigerator to match the sensitivity of a dog ’s nose .
When it comes to detecting melanomas , dogs are better diagnosticians than our best humans and our most advanced machines .
Doggy doctors offer some really wonderful possibilities , such as delivering low cost cancer detection to communities who may not have access to clinical care .
A mobile cancer detection puppy bus , anyone ?
Both these stories — about these talented animals and the pretend bus stop — are fantastic examples of what we can do without advanced technology .
I fear that we fetishize the latter , turning first to technology and forgetting to be creative about how to solve problems without them .
This post originally appeared in 2010 .
I love big , splashy spiral galaxies .
They are such eye candy , and of course their breadth and scale are magnificent .
Sweeping , curved arms of stars and gas a hundred thousand light years long ...
One of my favorites is NGC 253 , a nearly edge - on spiral that lies roughly 11 million light years away in the constellation of Sculptor .
I 've seen it many , many times , but I was honestly surprised when a new image was released by the European Southern Observatory .
I 've never seen it like this :
Wow !
Click to galactinate .
As you can see , it 's tilted pretty severely to our line of sight .
You can clearly see the spiral arms , and the dust lanes wrapping around the galactic center .
I was amazed to see the dust appears to be thicker on the top half than on the bottom .
I was even more amazed to clearly see the bar -- the elongated rectangular region in the center of the galaxy !
That 's almost completely undetectable in a visible light image of the galaxy :
That 's how I 'm used to seeing it : loaded with dust that hides the shape of the galaxy itself .
The top image , taken by the new VISTA 4.1 meter telescope , is in the infrared , which cuts through most of the dust and shows cooler , redder stars .
The bar in the center of the galaxy is formed due to the way the gravity of all the stars of the galaxy shapes the way they orbit the center .
In our solar system , the Sun outmasses everything else , and dominates the gravity of the system .
This makes the system fairly simple .
But in a galaxy the mass is spread out , and bizarre effects can occur as the combined mass of the stars affects the overall galaxy .
Spiral arms are one outcome of this , and bars are another .
One way to form such a bar is to have a big galaxy collide and merge with another galaxy .
Interestingly , NGC 253 is a starburst galaxy , which means it 's making new stars at a prodigious rate .
This can also happen when two galaxies merge , and their gas clouds collide .
On top of that , other studies looking at the velocities of stars and gas in the galaxy also indicate a merger .
It seems pretty clear NGC 253 had a very violent event happen to it in the recent past .
I suspect this may explain the thicker dust on one side than the other too .
It could be the remnants of the smaller galaxy , or perhaps the collision triggered huge amounts of star formation along one arm -- dust is created when young , massive stars die .
Perhaps I 'm way off here , but so many odd things happening in one galaxy with one clear explanation for so many of them makes me suspicious .
But the most important thing to me is that here we have a galaxy I thought I was at least passingly familiar with , and it turns out to have some major features about which I had n't a clue .
I suppose I could be embarrassed by that , but instead , quite honestly , it makes me glad !
I do n't think familiarity breeds contempt , necessarily , but it does tend to dull the sense of wonder .
And here I get to re-kick start that wonder .
It 's not often anyone gets a chance to do that .

The LCBO – a relatively conservative , government agency – wanted to run an ad in Toronto ’s annual pride guide .
When they reviewed the concepts internally , gay and lesbian staff immediately gravitated to the cheekiest concept .
Catching a break from humidity is like trying to watch your friend ’s energetic dog .
This means always paying close attention to it and keeping it under control is a must , or else it will make a mess !
The mess being fungal infections or mold growth in the case of humidity .
Some people sweat more than others but there ’s no arguing that humidity makes sweating harder to manage for everyone .
When mold starts to grow in a humid Texas residency , most people already know they have a big problem on their hands .
Which is why it ’s important to take time to prevent mold growth and practice personal hygiene to stay clear of fungal infections in the humid climate of Texas .
Mold Growth at Home
First , it ’s important to clarify what conditions mold can grow in .
Mold is found indoors and outdoors and thrives in humid , warm , and damp conditions .
As a matter of fact , nobody knows how many species of mold exist so they could grow in many different conditions .
For example , mold may not do well in dry environments , but mold spores can still survive even in extreme and diverse conditions .
People ca n’t start a search in any residency merely by looking for signs of visible mold .
The best place to check for mold in any household is always near the vents where the water is , and in the basement or utility room .
Basically , any area that has moisture and humidity present .
If one does not know what to look for , they can start off by searching for something that looks black , green , or brown .
It may also be fuzzy and give off a musty scent .
A few signs that are important to recognize if someone has mold in their house will be recognizing persistent physical symptoms that almost replicate allergies .
This can be things like running noses , rashes , sneezing , coughing , etc .
These symptoms will most likely be constant , and the individual or individuals will feel better when they leave the contaminated area .
If there is any suspicion of the mold being present , testing for mold should be the very first step .
This may frighten homeowners because of the cost and labor , but this is the health of the homeowner , their family , and their home that are in jeopardy .
The average cost to test for mold is around $ 834 according to Homeadvisor.com .
Many attempts to buy a cheap kit to use themselves , but quickly find it to not be accurate .
It is best to let a professional handle it .
If one absolutely knows that they have mold in their home , then there are actions that need to be taken as soon as possible .
If the problem mold area is only around three square feet , one can just take some bleach and water ( 1 part bleach , 15 parts water ) and treat the area themselves .
If the area is any bigger than three square feet , it is recommended to hire a fungus professional to look into removing it .
The longer one waits to treat the problem , the more damage can be brought upon the homeowner , their family , and their home .
If the problem is not treated in a timely manner , the maintenance cost will also rise as time goes on .
Fungal Infections Our Bodies Contract
It is important to know what mold and fungus can do to a body as much as one ’s home .
Fungal infections in the human body are actually fairly common , and it ’s important to be able to spot them and know about them .
A pathogenic fungus , otherwise known as a dermatophyte , is a fungus that infects and eats the outermost layer of the skin , nails , or hair and scalp .
One of the most common fungi that is publicly recognizable is athlete ’s foot .
This is a fungus that has symptoms that cause your feet to feel a burning and itching sensation , followed by peeling .
Athlete ’s foot happens mostly when wearing the same pair of socks over an extended period of time , coupled with sweaty feet .
It can also happen when one simply sweats too much , wears another person ’s footwear , or by walking around barefoot at a gym locker room and shower area .
Athlete ’s foot is luckily very treatable .
One can cure this fungal infection by washing their feet well , letting their feet breathe , buying new socks , or by purchasing ointment specifically aimed to treat athlete ’s foot .
Some severe cases that cannot be helped by ointment or natural remedies should be taken to a medical professional .
Another common fungal infection is ringworm .
By definition , ringworm is a contagious itching skin disease that occurs in small circular patches , caused by a number of fungi and affecting the scalp or feet .
It is also known as “ tinea ” .
This infection is common in humans as well as animals – most particularly dogs .
However , like athlete ’s foot , ringworm is also treatable in both humans and domestic animals .
Depending on how severe the infection is , animals can be treated with over - the - counter shampoo and ointment or prescribed oral medications given by a veterinarian .
Humans have even more treatment options ranging from lotions and powders to pills and patches .
Some are over - the - counter , but the quickest cures are prescription antifungal treatments .
For those who favor strictly natural remedies , try applying diluted apple vinegar to the infected patch area with a swab or cotton ball several times a day until the patches are gone .
And as always , if the infection is more severe , always seek a professional opinion for further help .
. . .
Fungal infections , as well as mold growths , can be a pesky thing to recognize right off the bat .
They are not always visible to the naked eye , and are commonly overlooked as allergy symptoms or a clustered collection of fuzzy , benign dust .
However , if taking the proper measures to look further into the problem , there may just be a solution at hand .
Whether treating a mold growth in a household or treating the human body , it ’s important to always take precaution and seek a professional if need be before it ’s too late .
Take these symptoms seriously and catching the signs early can make a world of difference .
Peruvian officials say Joran van der Sloot knows the location of Natalee Holloway 's body but will only talk to Aruban officials .
Get the latest tonight on " Nancy Grace , " at 8 p.m. on HLN .
Lima , Peru ( CNN ) -- Joran van der Sloot was charged with murder Friday , acting " with ferocity and great cruelty " in the slaying of a 21 - year - old student in Lima , Peru , according to court documents .
Van der Sloot also was charged with robbery in last week 's slaying of Stephany Flores Ramirez , according to a release from the Lima Superior Court of Justice .
Judge Juan Buendia Valenzuela ordered that van der Sloot be detained and turned over to penal authorities while awaiting trial .
He was transferred to a prison Friday afternoon , America TV showed in a broadcast .
The 22 - year - old Dutch citizen was considered the main suspect in the 2005 disappearance of Alabama teen Natalee Holloway in Aruba , where van der Sloot lived .
He has been arrested twice in connection with the case but was released for lack of evidence .
Van der Sloot told authorities he attacked Flores on May 30 after she read an e-mail on his computer connected with the Holloway case , Peruvian national police said in a statement Thursday .
The court also accused three men of failing to report the crime , the release said .
Brothers John Williams Aparcana Pisconte and John Oswaldo Aparcana Pisconte , along with Carlos Alberto Uribe Petril , drove van der Sloot from Peru to Chile last week , police said .
Van der Sloot was arrested in Chile on June 3 and returned to the next day to Peru , where police say he confessed to killing Flores .
Police say that in addition to savagely beating and killing Flores , who had a broken neck , he took money and bank cards from her wallet before fleeing .
The robbery charge is related to that accusation .
Flores and van der Sloot went to a hotel room registered in his name after playing poker at a nearby casino , police say .
Hotel surveillance video shows them entering his room together and him leaving alone more than three hours later .
In the Holloway case , van der Sloot told investigators during an interrogation that he knows the location of her body , a Peruvian police official said .
But van der Sloot would not identify the location or say what happened to her the night of her disappearance , said Miguel Canlla , head of the homicide division of the Peruvian national police investigative unit .
" In the interrogation done to the Dutch citizen , he says he knew the location of the corpse of the American citizen but that he was going to explain everything to Aruban police , " Canlla said Thursday .
Canlla said Thursday that Aruban police were not currently in Peru and that he did not know whether Aruban and Peruvian investigators had been in contact .
Van der Sloot 's lawyer , Maximo Alonso Altez Navarro , has said he plans to ask the judge in the case to strike down van der Sloot 's confession because he was not properly represented when he was interrogated .
Canlla defended his department 's interrogation and said van der Sloot 's confession was acquired legally .
" The statement was done within all the requirements stipulated by Peruvian law , " he said .
Canlla said investigators were still waiting for judicial permission in order to investigate the contents of van der Sloot 's computer .
But authorities have gathered significant evidence , he said .
Bloodstains found on van der Sloot 's clothes match Flores ' blood type , he said .
" We found bloodstains on the victim 's clothes , and we found bloodstains on his clothes , which , according to biological testing , they correspond to the victim , " he said .
Police said in a statement Thursday that van der Sloot presumably attacked Flores to rob her of the money she had won gambling at a casino .
The two met playing poker May 27 and had several encounters before driving together to van der Sloot 's hotel May 30 .
After killing her , the police statement said , van der Sloot cleaned the room in an attempt to hide evidence of the crime , changed clothes and fled with Flores ' money , bank cards and black Jeep .
Police said the evidence against van der Sloot includes his confession , forensic data , surveillance videos and fingerprints from the crime scene and Flores ' Jeep .
Altez , van der Sloot 's lawyer , claims he has found indications that the handling of the evidence was tainted , especially the way the body was handled during the crime scene investigation .
But Canlla said there were no irregularities in the investigation .
Although van der Sloot was never charged in connection with Holloway 's disappearance in 2005 , U.S. authorities have filed extortion and wire fraud charges against him .
A FBI affidavit says van der Sloot tried to extort money from Holloway 's mother .
The FBI says a representative for Holloway 's mother paid $ 25,000 last month for information on the whereabouts of her daughter 's remains .
Van der Sloot said he would reveal the location of the body and the circumstances surrounding Holloway 's death for $ 25,000 in cash and asked for $ 250,000 in total , the document states .
The FBI and U.S. attorney 's office in Birmingham , Alabama , arranged for a meeting in which van der Sloot was paid $ 10,000 in cash and another $ 15,000 in a wire transfer , the affidavit said .
The meeting took place last month , according to the U.S. attorney 's office in Birmingham .
The FBI affidavit says the $ 15,000 was transferred to a personal bank account in the Netherlands .
In exchange for the money , the document said , van der Sloot showed the representative a house where Holloway 's remains supposedly were buried .
When records and aerial photography showed that construction had not started on the house at the time of the disappearance , van der Sloot admitted that he lied , the affidavit said .
John Kelly , an attorney for Holloway 's mother , has said he is the unnamed person mentioned in the FBI affidavit as having taken the money to Aruba and met with van der Sloot .
A source with intimate knowledge of the case confirmed for CNN that Kelly is the cooperating witness named in the affidavit .
The money paid to van der Sloot came from Holloway 's mother , Kelly said .
According to the affidavit , van der Sloot said his father helped him conceal Holloway 's body and buried it under the house a few days later while van der Sloot waited in a car .
" Van der Sloot added that he had not actually seen his father inter the remains but was told and shown by his father where the body was buried , " the affidavit states .
Van der Sloot 's father , Paulus , died in February while playing tennis in Aruba .
He was an attorney and judge and had been involved in his son's defense in the Holloway case .

Lieberman , flanked at a Jerusalem press conference by his senate colleagues John McCain ( R - AZ ) and Lindsey Graham ( R - SC ) , used very tough language , saying the words “ military action ” in regards to stopping Iran ’s nuclear program .
Most US officials opt to tiptoe around the subject , saying “ no options are off the table .
” Lieberman said that “ a certain trumpet needs to sounded here for the Iranian regime to hear .
” He said the sanctions Congress recently passed against Iran were meant to signal to Teheran to “ negotiate the end of their nuclear program and re-entry into the civilized world , if that is possible .
But if not , they should know that when Congress says it is unacceptable to get nuclear weapons , we mean it .
We hope economic and diplomatic power will work , but if we must use force , that must remain a very active option .
” Regarding Tuesday ’s friendly meeting in Washington between Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and US President Barack Obama , Lieberman – based on reports he heard from people there – said “ it was a positive meeting , and we can say with some encouragement that the relationship between the US and Israel is back on track .
” Lieberman , acknowledging that the past year was a “ difficult one ” in the US - Israel relationship , said that even during this period “ the members of Congress across party lines continued to both feel and express strong support for the security of the State of Israel , and for the relationship .
” Graham was even blunter .
“ The Congress has Israel ’s back , ” he said , “ and never misunderstand that .
Whatever relationship problems we have had in the past , it has never seeped over into Congress .
The Congress has been united in protection of one of our best allies in the world , the State of Israel . ” Regarding another American ally , Turkey , McCain – referring to both Ankara ’s vote against Iran sanctions at the UN and its hostile rhetoric toward Israel – said he has been “ disappointed recently ” by Turkey ’s “ actions and words .
” At the same time , he said , Turkey is an old and close ally with whom the US has common interests .
“ I hope that at some point the Turkish leadership would lower the rhetoric , reduce it to the point where we can try to solve differences in a quiet and diplomatic way , ” McCain said .
Asked what would happen to US - Turkish ties if Ankara severed , as it has threatened to do , its ties with Israel , McCain replied , “ obviously it would n’t be helpful .
I hope this wo n’t be the case .
I hope that there will be conversations . ”
Saying that the Israeli - Turkish relationship has “ contributed to stability in the Middle East , ” McCain said he found the situation “ disturbing , ” and said he hoped the US could play an “ interlocutor role to bridge some of these differences . ” Fundamentally , McCain said , Turkey remains a secular nation that has “ contributed enormously to peace in the region and the world .
” All three senators , who met during their two - day stay with Defense Minister Ehud Barak and Chief of General Staff Lt. - Gen. Gabi Ashkenazi , as well as with Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Salam Fayyad , praised the US - trained PA security forces .
McCain , in an apparent reference to talk about putting PA security forces at border crossings from Israel into Gaza , said the willingness of Israel to discuss this issue showed the confidence Israel had in these forces as well .
The US supreme court has upheld a broad - ranging law that allows Americans who offer advice to banned organisations , including legal assistance and information on conflict resolution , to be prosecuted as terrorists .
The case arose out of human rights advice given by a California group to Kurdish and Tamil organisations that are listed as terrorist groups in the US .
The supreme court upheld the Obama administration 's argument that even advice intended to be used for peaceful purposes amounted to " material support " for terrorism .
That includes a lawyer submitting a friend - of - the - court brief on behalf of a banned group or helping a proscribed organisation to petition international bodies to bring an end to a violent conflict .
" The supreme court has ruled that human rights advocates , providing training and assistance in the nonviolent resolution of disputes , can be prosecuted as terrorists , " said David Cole , a Georgetown university law professor who argued the case before the court .
" In the name of fighting terrorism , the court has said that the first amendment [ on free speech ] permits congress to make it a crime to work for peace and human rights .
That is wrong . "
The ruling is likely to further complicate the work of activists in support of controversial causes that has already seen highly contentious prosecutions over other forms of support , such as fundraising .
Palestinian activists have been prosecuted and jailed for raising cash for social groups dealing with issues such as housing and welfare that have ties to Hamas , which governs Gaza .
Individuals and groups offering legal or other specialist advice to such groups are also now open to prosecution .
The ruling involved the Humanitarian Law Project in Los Angeles , which provided human rights training to the Kurdistan Workers ' Party ( PKK ) .
It argued that the assistance was nonviolent and did not promote the goals of the PKK .
One of the plaintiffs , Ralph Fertig , is a retired lawyer who had sought to help the PKK bring attention to the rights of Kurds at international bodies .
The US government said it regarded that as support for terrorism .
It argued that Fertig was free to speak in support of the PKK 's aims but that he could not provide it with advice .
The Kurdistan Workers ' Party is one of about 30 organisations listed as terrorist organisations by the US government .
The others include Hamas , Hezbollah and the Khmer Rouge .
A lower court had struck down the law as unconditionally vague .
But by a majority of 6 - 3 , the supreme court ruled that the government has the right " to prohibit providing material support in the form of training , expert advice , personnel , and services to foreign terrorist groups , even if the supporters meant to promote only the groups ' non-violent ends " .
The chief justice , John Roberts , said : " At bottom , plaintiffs simply disagree with the considered judgment of congress and the executive that providing material support to a designated foreign terrorist organisation – even seemingly benign support – bolsters the terrorist activities of that organisation . "
The dissenting judges said that the decision " deprives the individuals before us of the protection the first amendment demands " .
In hearing the case , the justices discussed what amounts to specialist advice and whether it is a crime to teach a terrorist to play the harmonica .
The government 's case was argued in February by Elena Kagan , who is now the Obama administration 's nominee to the supreme court .
" Hezbollah builds bombs .
Hezbollah also builds homes .
What Congress decided was when you help Hezbollah build homes , you are also helping Hezbollah build bombs .
That 's the entire theory behind the statute , " she told the court .
A group called the National Republican Trust Pac is airing this disturbing ad to fight the construction of a mosque near ground zero in Manhattan .
The ad refers to all Muslims as “ they ” and links them all to terrorism and the killing of Americans .
Specifically , the ad claims that a house of worship near ground zero would be a declaration of victory by those who attacked us .
The organization ’s website states that “ [ t ] he NRT is committed to continuing the legacy of Ronald Reagan . ”
It is now incumbent on Republicans to denounce this ad and the obvious anti-Muslim sentiments expressed within it .
It is doubly distasteful to see some using our collective loss at 9 - 11 for such hateful purposes .

VIEWPOINT
Jonathan Jones
With the world 's food security facing a looming " perfect storm " , GM food crops need to be part of the solution , argues Professor Jonathan Jones .
In this week 's Green Room , he wonders why there is such a fuss about biotechnology when it can help deliver a sustainable global food system .
In the US , where many processed foods contain ingredients derived from GM maize or soy , in the most litigious society in history , nobody has sued for a GM health problem
A billion humans do not have enough to eat .
Water resources are limited , energy costs are rising , the cultivatable land is already mostly cultivated , and climate change could hit productive areas hard .
We need a sustainable intensification of agriculture to increase production by 50 % by 2030 - but how ?
Food security requires solutions to many diverse problems .
In the US or Europe , improved seeds could increase yields by 10 % or more , reduce pesticide use and give " more crop per drop " .
However , improved seeds can only help impoverished African farmers if they also have reliable water supply , roads to take crops to market , and ( probably most important ) fertiliser .
Better farming methods are also part of the solution ; these require investment in technology and people .
Fortunately , after 25 years of " food complacency " , policymakers are taking the issue seriously again .
I want to reduce the environmental impact of agriculture while maintaining food supply .
The best thing we can do is cultivate less land , leaving more for wildlife , but if we are still to produce enough food , yields must go up .
There are many contributors to yield ; water , fertiliser , farming practice , and choice of seed .
' Simple method '
We can improve crop variety performance by both plant breeding ( which gets better every year with new genetic methods ) , and by genetic modification ( GM ) .
Droughts caused wheat prices to rocket as global harvests failed Ouch ; yuck - GM .
Did you recoil from those letters ?
Why ?
I started making GM plants ( petunias , as it happens ) in 1983 , working at a long defunct agbiotech company in California called Advanced Genetic Sciences .
In the early 80s , we did wonder about - in Rumfeldspeak - " unknown unknowns ; the unknowns we did n't know we did n't know about " , but 27 years later , nothing alarming has been seen .
The method ( GM is a method not a thing ) is simple .
We take a plant , which typically carries about 30,000 genes , and add a few additional genes that confer insect resistance , or herbicide resistance , or disease resistance , or more efficient water use , or improved human nutrition , or less polluting effluent from animals that eat the grain , or more efficient fertiliser uptake , or increased yield .
We could even ( heck , why not ? ) do all of the above to the same plant .
The result is increased yield , decreased agrochemical use and reduced environmental impact of agriculture .
In commercial GM , many hundreds of independent introductions of the desired new gene ( the " transgene " ) are made , each in a different individual plant that is selected and tested .
Most lines are discarded .
To be commercialised , a line must carry a simple , stable and well - defined gene insertion , and show heritable and effective transgene function , with no deleterious effects on the plant .
Growing demand GM is the most rapidly adopted , benign , effective new technology for agriculture in my lifetime .
Researchers say GM potatoes will drastically cut the use of fungicides
Field trial of GM potatoes begins Fourteen million farmers grow GM crops on 135 million hectares ; these numbers increased by about 10 % per year over the past decade , and this rate of growth continues .
More than 200,000 tonnes of insecticide have not been applied , thanks to built - in insect resistance in Bt crops ; how could anyone think that 's a bad thing ?
Bt maize is safer to eat because of lower levels of mycotoxins from fungi that enter the plant 's grains via the holes made by corn - borer feeding ; no insects , no holes , no fungal entry , no toxins in our food .
There are not enough fish in the sea to provide us all with enough omega 3 fatty acids in our diet , but we can now modify oilseeds to make this nutrient in crops on land .
Protection from rootworm means maize crops capture more water and fertiliser , so less is wasted .
Farmers must always control weeds ; herbicide tolerant ( HT ) soy makes this easier , and has enabled replacement of water - polluting persistent herbicides with the more benign and rapidly inactivated glyphosate .
HT soy has enabled wider low - till agriculture , reducing CO2 emissions .
And yet in Europe , we seem stuck in a time warp .
Worldwide , 135 million hectares of GM crops have been planted ; yet in Norfolk , I needed to spend £ 30,000 of taxpayers ' money to provide security for a field experiment with 192 potato plants , carrying one or another of a disease resistance gene from a wild relative of potato .
It boggles the mind .
What are people afraid of ?
' Wishful thinking '
Some fear the domination of the seed industry by multinationals , particularly Monsanto .
We need smart , sustainable , sensitive science and technology , and we need to use every tool in our toolbox , including GM
Monsanto is certainly the most determined and successful agbiotech company .
In their view , they had to be ; they bet the company on agbiotech because unlike their rivals ( who also sell nylon or agrichemicals ) they had nothing else to fall back on .
But monopoly is bad for everyone .
Here 's a part solution ; deregulate GM .
If it costs more than $ 20 m ( £ 13 m ) to get regulatory approval for one transgene , lots of little GM - based solutions to lots of problems will be too expensive and therefore not deployed , and the public sector and small start - up companies will not make the contribution they could .
Never before has such excessive regulation been created in response to ( still ) purely hypothetical risks .
The cost of this regulation - demanded by green campaigners - has bolstered the monopoly of the multinationals .
This is a massive own - goal and has postponed the benefits to the environment and to us all .
Some fear GM food is bad for health .
There are no data that support this view .
In the US , where many processed foods contain ingredients derived from GM maize or soy , in the most litigious society in history , nobody has sued for a GM health problem .
Some fear GM is bad for the environment .
But in agriculture , idealism does not solve problems .
Farmers need " least bad " solutions ; they do not have the luxury of insisting on utopian solutions .
It is less bad to control weeds with a rapidly inactivated herbicide after the crop germinates , than to apply more persistent chemicals beforehand .
It is less bad to have the plant make its own insecticidal protein , than to spray insecticides .
It is better to maximise the productivity of arable land via all kinds of sustainable intensification , than to require more land under the plough because of reduced yields .
Some say GM is high risk , but they cannot tell you what the risk is .
Some say GM is causing deforestation in Brazil , even though if yields were less , more deforestation would be required to meet Chinese and European demand for animal feed .
Some say we do not need GM blight resistant potatoes to solve the £ 3.5 bn per year problem of potato blight , because blight resistant varieties have been bred .
But if these varieties are so wonderful , how come farmers spend £ 500 per hectare on spraying to protect blight sensitive varieties ?
The answer is the market demands varieties such as Maris Piper , so we need to make them blight resistant .
I used to be a member of a green campaign group .
They still have campaigns I support ( sustainable fishing , save the rainforests , fight climate change ) , but on GM , they are simply wrong .
Even activists of impeccable green credentials , such as Stewart Brand , see the benefits of GM .
Wishful thinking will not feed the planet without destroying it .
Instead , we need smart , sustainable , sensitive science and technology , and we need to use every tool in our toolbox , including GM .
Professor Jonathan Jones is senior scientist for The Sainsbury Laboratory , based at the John Innes Centre , a research centre in plant and microbial science The Green Room is a series of opinion articles on environmental topics running weekly on the BBC News website UPDATE ( 19 July ) : Following a request from Professor Jones , we have updated his affiliation details .
In 1997 , he also co-founded the California company Mendel Biotechnology ( www.mendelbio.com), which carries out contract research with Monsanto , Bayer and BP , and he is still a member of the Mendel science advisory board .
Do you agree with Professor Jones ?
Why are people in Europe so fearful of GM food crops ?
Is it part of the solution to deliver a sustainable supply of food for future generations ?
Or does it have the potential to do more harm than good ?
GM foods are given an awful hard time by general public ignorance .
Nanotechnology is yet another candidate , just most people do not realise that they use so much of it in daily life .
Corporations do have the chance to exploit this technology - but as Prof Jones rightly states - deregulation will solve this .
A government led review of that patent and IP law would also be needed to prevent corporate monopoly - but do n't forget that GM will always have to compete with the natural stuff - the consumer is not likely to be hurt in the wallet .
In the " age of austerity , " and with food poverty still a huge global issue and only set to get worse , surely NOT utilising technologies such as this is the most selfish and evil thing we westerners can do .
As for " It has n't been proven safe " well , sorry .
Science has always experimented with the unsafe .
Detection methods and safety this century are millions of times better than previous scientists have had , and whilst that does n't preclude the fact that things can and do go wrong , progress will never be made with such an attitude .
If it is proven dangerous , then I will listen , It may take just one experiment to prove something to be dangerous , but you cannot prove anything to be safe , no matter how many experiments you do .
Only that it has n't been discovered to be dangerous YET .
Stu Haynes , Coventry , UK
As regards the economics of GM , it is worth remembering that Monsanto and others were perfectly happy to produce plants which had fertile seeds .
The reason GM plants do not have fertile seeds is solely due to the green lobby insisting that GM plants must be infertile , so that GM traits cannot find their way into the wider ecosystem .
Anti-GM campaigners are therefore criticising agribusiness for doing precisely what anti-GM campaigners asked them to do !
It 's also important to note that whilst distribution is indeed a problem in the third world , better distribution networks will simply have the result of destroying third - world farming , since it'd be cheaper to buy grain farmed on American prairies on an industrial scale than to grow it yourself in Africa .
This is already happening on a significant scale , and only the lack of infrastructure is currently holding it back .
Graham Bartlett , Cambridge ,
Uk I think GM has missed the boat , none of the current projects appear to work but do damage the environment .
It appears similar to the green revolution of the sixties , now held responsible for destroying whole agricultural areas of India and eslewhere .
I do not believe that the risk is still hypothetical , where it has been implimented there is far greater damage than expected and it appears that the crops themselves just help the problems they were designed to combat evolve .
The plan was to make lots of money by having complete control over crop production , it has not paid off and appears far less useful than modern methods like no til farming .
Craig , Edinburgh , UK Agree in principle with the good Prof.
Deregulate and focus on method are key .
Besides GM , employing and enhancing farming and harvesting methods for increased yields need be taught and encouraged .
Crop rotation , soil restoration and reintroduction of grazing animals onto crop farms will all help .
James Doerfel , Redmond , Wa How could the BBC publish an article so pro-GM , written by someone with ties to Monsanto without full disclosure of this obvious interest ?
Do not allow my licence fee to be spent furthering the greed of an organisation intent on making us dependent on them for our food - supply .
Dan B , London
A big problem is lack of science education or knowledge on the part of otherwise educated people about how food gets to their tables .
For example , Darren of Ottawa says that companies make GM crops sterile so that farmers have to buy new seed .
He is confusing genetic engineering with hybrid varieties , and in the latter case farmers buy fresh seed each crop season ( rather than re-sowing saved seed ) not because of sterility , but because the progeny of re-sown hybrids lose their " hybrid vigor " and uniformity , and grow as a very heterogenous stand of individual plants that will yield much less on average .
This lack of understanding makes it hard for people to evaluate information from diverse sources and easy for anti-GM groups to mix fact with supposition , as they often do so well !
Mike Listman , Texcoco , Mexico Interestingly , Professor Jones is on the scientific advisory board of Mendel Biotechnology , a company that counts Monsanto as their most important customer and collaborator .
This article smacks more of corporate propaganda than reasoned argument .
Jack Judge , Reigate , UK I agree heartily with Jonathan Jones .
Improved crop varieties have a part to play in increasing yields to get more food to the poor .
Plant breeders can do this and it is wrong to deny them one particular modern technique - genetic engineering - just because there is irrational opposition .
All crops have been greatly modified genetically by selection and breeding ( a good book for general readers is Hybrid by Noel Kingsbury , 2009 ) so GM has always been an unfortunate term , implying that other crops have not been modified .
Most arguments by the opposition arise from incomplete knowledge of the current situation .
For example , farmers are perfectly familiar with buying seed each year for new varieties of crops when they are F1 hybrids that do not breed true ( half the rice in China and most maize worldwide are F1 hybrid varieties ) .
They make a judgement that the increased cost is covered by the better yields , improved pest resistance , etc .
Much plant breeding in the developing world is carried out by national and international research centres , such as the International Rice Research Institute , with varieties released without restrictions , for the public good .
Peter Mitchell , Sheffield , U.K. I fully support the article .
The arguments against in comments are common but not valid .
We are reliant on corporations for many things in life .
The state is a corporation , with a monopoly on the use of force over a territory .
I would rather be reliant on a private corporation than the state .
Farmers buy the seeds voluntarily every year because they save time and money .
The best way to control population is through development - not starvation .
There is no proof that anything you can imagine wo n't have a side effect down the road because you cannot prove a negative - you deal with it if it arises .
Brendan Trainor , Reno USA
You are treating the symptom not the cause .
We do not need GM crops .
Every single Human world resource issue we currently have is down to one thing .
Our population growth as a species is what needs to be dealt with .
There are simply too many people in the world and the problem will keep getting worse until we tackle this very thorny issue .
Danny Coombs , Calgary , Canada
I dont know about any studies , but I do know that my son is violently allergic to soy oil and any derivatives of soy products made from GM soy .
No I have no scientific evidence and as far as I know no one has done a study ( these cost time and money ) as they say the proof is in the pudding .
He can eat anything cooke din soybean oil when it is from European origin , but gets a strong reaction when its US originsoy products .... which are all contaminated by GM prodicts .
I think that says a lot for being anti GM
G , Mississauga , Canada
Interesting to see so many adverse comments here about the main problem with GM technology being corporate ownership .
The author of the article is a public servant who works for a publicly - funded institution in the UK .
We can all own this technology - we do n't have to sell it to any corporates .
Also some misunderstandings about realities of agriculture displayed here - modern conventional seed varieties are usually owned by the breeders , which means that if we want to plant them again we have to pay for the right .
This is far from exclusive to GM technology , and high - yielding F1 hybrid varieties cannot be farm - saved year to year as they do n't breed true .
Dr Jim Dimmock , Bodelva , Par , Cornwall , UK Hardly a balanced argument , is it ?
Whenever I hear an argument that states " I am right and you are wrong " it makes me very suspicious .
Life is very rarely that simple , and in this area , can not be that simple .
Professor Jones completely ignores the topics of improved storage and biological control of pests and pathogens .
Personally , I would n't give this paper a pass grade .
Michael Papworth , Pershore GM foods will never solve famine problems and it is naive to suggest otherwise .
The vast majority of GM research is done by commercial companies and not charities .
How can people incapable of affording traditional varieties ( that can be resown year after year ) , afford the cost of GM crops that cost five times more and cannot be resown ?
Carl Thomas , Melbourne , Australia
I agree there are monopolistic dangers of Monsanto 's round - up - ready GM crops .
But as to dangers of GM crops ....
If only the public realised that conventional breeding , with it 's lack of regulation can actually result in toxic varieties that will remain undiscovered until consumed .
Just look at potato breeding early last century , a brand new , blight resistant variety made it to market , but made thousands of people seriously ill including some recorded deaths .
This could still happen today , with conventional breeding , but not GM .
By using GM , BASF have moved blight resistance from a wild potato into a modern potato that does not also cause humans harm .
Yes this could have been done with conventional breeding but would have taken decades and has far more serious risks to human health .
Dr Richard Hayes , Aberystwyth , Uk So you 've modified a few petunias and there has been no problem that you 've noticed .
Big deal .
That is not proof that there will not be an unforeseen problem in decades to come if GM crops are grown globally .
We do not have a complete understanding of the way everything in the environment co-exists .
With reference to your comments about
Bt maize being resistant to insects , how do you know that another species further up the food chain does not reply on that insect ?
Use of GM may cause the population of that insect to plummet causing other species to fall in numbers .
It may appear to be completely unrelated , but it could cause the collapse of another species we rely upon .
There are too many variables to be absolutely sure that GM will have no ill effects or cause no problem .
It can often take a long time before we realise what problems scientific advances cause , e.g. lead in petrol , CFCs .
Ian Beckett , Manchester , Uk It 's laudable - we 'll genetically modify a baby to rid it 's chances of diseases , get a preferred eye colour and choose it 's sex .
But a plant ?
Oh no !
Nightshade , Swindon
We are all talking about preserving the environment , aint we ??
Then , what about the traditional form of agriculture where tons of chemical are being used as pesticide or herbicides !!
What about all those fertile lands being converted to arid one due to extensive farming ???
What about the unsustainable exploitation of the oceans to satisfy the growing needs ??
I believe we have to stop being selfish !!!
The one opposing to GM are the same who voiced out against exploitation of whales n others marine organsim !!
In the end , whether we want it or not we have to sacrifice something for something whether we want it or not !!!
If we are to opt for taditional agriculture , surely , we are to destroy our environment in some way .
Concerning GM production , we are unsure about their long - term effects !
In either way we are sure to make considerable impacts !
PP , Mu A common feature between the pro and anti-GM propaganda is the artificial dichotomy : the idea that either a crop is GM or it is non-GM .
All GM means is we spliced in some different proteins .
So I could splice some toxic compound into corn to produce corn that it is fatal to consume .
This would be an example of a non -safe GM product .
Likewise , I could splice something that increases the vitamin C content into corn , which would be very unlikely to be dangerous .
We need to stop dealing with this on a BS vested interest level and start looking into the details of the issue : some crops are safe , some are n't and most are unclear .
If we splice a pesticide directly into a crop , that does n't make it safe .
There are also more complex cases : what if we splice resistance to a pesticide into a crop , which then increases pesticide use , indirectly making it less safe ?
All that said , this piece reads like a few pages of Monsanto press release .
Alex , Mountain View , CA Being from the USA where GM foods are almost all we have , we are facing serious problems from mono-cultures and the " trademarking " of these wonderful GM seeds as companies like Monsanto seek to eliminate any non-trademarked seeds so all farmers are indebted to them .
This topic is not about picky eaters it is about global corporate take - over .
I spent years in the farmland of the midwest USA where farmers were permanently in debt to Monsanto .... WTO anyone ?!?!?
This was a misleading article BBC !!
Lisa Anthony , Seattle , USA
It 's not the supposed health issues which GM food may or may not pose to humans that most are worried about .
It 's detrimental affects to the encompassing environment ( soil and water from applied pesticides , and threat to native plants ) .
We need to keep a variety of species to assure food security .
Harmony Farnsworth , Reno , USA
Cows may need 18 lb plant food for 1 lb beef , pork 8 lb for 1 lb , Chickens 4 lb for 1 lb .
If we eat the plant food , that means agricultural production can feed 4 or 8 or more times as many people .
We do n't need livestock or milk or eggs for health .
As is becoming very clear in Asia , " Diseases of Affluence " heart disease , diabetes , cancer , dementia , ... directly follow the heavily animal food based " Diet of Affluence " .
Read " The China Study " by T. Colin Campbell , phd , Cornell nutrition researcher , Jane Plant CBE 's many books , ... Global warming from global livestock production has been calculated to exceed global warming from all of transportation .
Jerry Amos , Hollis , NH U.S.A .
Quite apart from the dubious benefits of GM food , is no - one concerned about handing over monopoly rights to the production of food to a handful of multinational corporations ?
GM food is patented food ; the patent holder has an exclusive monopoly on the production of that food .
That 's the whole point of GM food as far as the corporation is concerned .
Despite being patented the crops will spread into non-GM areas whereupon the corporation will sue the pants off any anyone unfortunate enough to find the stuff growing on their land ( yes , Monsanto , I 'm talking about you . )
You do have to admit it is genius : develop a food which gives you a monopoly right to sell AND spreads itself to non-customers who are then forced to become customers .
William Wybourne , Wellington , New Zealand
How about making GM food / crops non-propietary for individuals or small farmers and only applying IP rules for companies / groups motivated by greed and not need ?
That is , develop non-terminal , stress tolerant GM seeds for the hungry but hardworking folks of the developing world but at the same time ensure that the greedy business folks of the same developing world as well as the developed nations do n't infringe upon the GM patents through unique seed markers ?
As a scientist , this appears feasible to me and the big GM companies certainly could use some good ' karma ' in their business practices -- do each of their well - intentioned presidents , scientists and inspectors really want to keep increasing the exorbitance of their meals at the expense of millions of the famished poor at the brink of death ?

There is not a food shortage .
There is a surplus of food actually .
Unfortunately , all the food resources are concentrated in the wealthier nations and the people that are starving do n't see any of it .
Producing more food is definitely not the answer and even further from the answer is resorting to GM foods .
GM corn and soy products have been shown to cause cancer and kidney failure in rats .
Imagine what it is doing to us which will likely not show up for generations .
The FDA does not take the responsibility of regulating GM foods seriously and they are the ones supposed to ensure safety of the general population .
At least in the UK they regulate GM foods .
In the US we are all lab rats for the machine .
Cortney , Indianapolis , IN , USA GM technology simply represents an intensification of agricultural practices and associated environmental and socio-economic problems .
Environmental problems include biodiversity loss , soil erosion and pollution of water bodies .
Of particular concern is the potential for gene transfer between crops and non crop species , resulting in super - weeds that are more difficult to control .
Unfortunately , the potential long term environmental effects of GM crops have been poorly studied due to the short term nature of research grants ( Typically 3 - 5 years ) .
On a socio- economic level , GM technology is unlikely to result in an end to world hunger .
The post war ' green revolution ' was also promoted as a means to ending world hunger , but has instead resulted in a population boom ( also thanks to advances in healthcare ) .
Food inequality remains , and and many of the poorest and hungriest nations continue to have high levels of population growth .
Continuous population growth is unsustainable and impossible due to limited natural resources .
Ironically GM technology could result in greater food insecurity , as world agriculture becomes dominated by a small number of varieties offered by large multinationals .
The idea of deregulation of GM is to me wholly irresponsible , particularly when the technology is so new .
Promotion of the technology has generally been by those that have the most to gain from it financially such as Prof.
Jones .

There is really only one thing to say .
It is obviously Monsanto propaganda since the author , Jonanthan Jones , works for Mendel Biotechnology .
A quote from the Mendel website , " Mendel 's most important customer and collaborator for our technology business is Monsanto " .
Come on BBC and professor Jones !
Michael Eck , Richmond , Va .
We 're always being told how GM crops " will " help poor people in the developing world .
But how can this be when the seeds cost money ?
If people can't buy food , which they can consume immediately , how the heck are they going to be able to pay for GM seeds ?
Maybe in Utopia they will be free , but not here on planet earth .
Two things that will help the developing world out of poverty : contraception and education , especially about appropriate agriculture .
North , London , UK Great article .
I wonder , in a world without media hype what people would think about the food they eat and other household products they use .
I stagger when smoking friends start a tirade against " GM " saying they only eat organic ( with all those nice fungal toxins ) while pumping their kids lungs full of the great pesticide nicotine .
On question does pop to mind though .
The statement related to Monsanto ; " because unlike their rivals ( who also sell nylon or agrichemicals ) they had nothing else to fall back on " does n't quite fit .
Glyphosate was held by Monsanto patent until 2000 and we all know it 's most famous trade name - Roundup ( a Monsanto product ) .
Whatever the motive for development of transgenic crops I for one welcome their use .
Sarah , Africa
For those asking for the source of Jones ' funding , he is involved with Mendel Biotechnology , which has close ties to Monsanto .
From Mendel : " The interests of Mendel and Monsanto are highly aligned and the companies have established very effective mechanisms of collaboration " - I would certainly agree !
Jones seems to be helping quite a bit !
It 's a pity that he can't be more creative than reciting the same list of refuted arguments we have seen from Monsanto .
Conrad , Norway LOL , Obviously greased by the mentioned companies that fund his research be it indirectly and can this prof really be so baised , if not naive ?
GM is commercial and clearly for the benefit of these companies .
The problem is distribution , logistics , always has been .
Better farming Techniques and metereological accuracy are whats needed , just to mention a couple .
InHindSight , Africa Feeding humans directly instead of animals will dramatically increase the world food supply , as will reducing food wastage - GM is a risk like a lit match in a dry field - easier to ignite than to put out .
An infection that could kill the world 's grain crops is a risk too far .
It is totally unnecessary .

The problem with GM foods is that we do n't have long - term studies done as to what the changes in the food does .
It has been shown that after three generations of eating only GM food , hamsters go completely sterile .
This is a problem .
Not today , not tomorrow , but the day after that .
If the companies that made GM grain seeds did n't also make the plants sterile , you would see many more people using them .
As it goes right now , farmers can't use the seeds they gather from their own plants for next year 's crop .
They have to turn around and buy new seeds from the supplier .
GM foods have a good potential , but they need more study done , and the companies that create them would need to take a checkbook hit by providing plants that can grow again next year .

I remember a few years ago a frozen food company was calling it Frankenstein food and handing out cards saying how bad it was .
The only reason i could come up with is if things have a longer shelf life then it would remove the need to buy a lot of frozen food point been its not just the general populace that needs to be convinced .
Plus people will never understand the problems unless it is actually happening to them how quickly would they change there minds about gm foods if we had rationing for some reason i wonder ?
joho , corby GM wo n't solve the issue of food security .
All that will happen is that populations will expand even further and we 'll be in an even more unsustainable position than we are now .
For a species like humans , who are generally incapable of self regulation , famine is a good thing .
Luke Forbes , Leicester , Uk Research is not conclusive that GM is safe in the long term - there are some serious questions .
You do not state who funds the professor 's research - it sounds like Monsanto propaganda .
Monsanto's claim to infamy was the production of agent orange .
If the safety of GM is so self - evident then why is Monsanto so paranoid about not labelling foods GM and why irradiate the foods so the seeds can not be used used but must be purchased each year - what is the point of theis practice if not profit .
If there is a strong suspicion that something may be harmful then it should be stopped until proven safe or not ( compare the tobacco industry 's decades of lies ) and not continued with immense propaganda campaigns to tout its safety while serious questions remain .
If GM is detrimental to the gene pool of humans - in long term - then we are in ' grave ' trouble .
Experiments with animals show that this may be so .
When you get govt .
monisters swearing on a stack of bibles that something is safe , I am immediately suspicious that the opposite may be true .
Brian Barnett , Tucson AZ Monoculture extends to food crops by agribusiness suppliers simply deciding to widely offer varieties for cultivation which out perform traditional rivals .
This has led for instance to local peoples of South America switching to growing few varieties instead of the wide number of types from the wilds which had been hardened with time by years of small scale cultivation .
The danger of introducing genetic traits to plants so they incorporate medicine or pesticide production as part of their growth cycle is frightening .
Alterations of genetic code can be applied to pathogens as well and the potential of uncontrolled reproduction in natural settings is like the oil spill that should n't have happened .
Alterations of code can be applied to creatures including humans as well .
Corporations , limited liability corporation , corporations too big to fail making decisions about what patents they hold and how to splice the sequence of life and market it with assurances it wo n't escape into the fabric of Nature to do harm ..
Perhaps a serious topic of discussions this Fall in Cancun can be international oversight of genetic engineering with the gold standard to do no harm .
Dale Lanan , Longmont , Colorado USA
Perhaps permaculture techniques involving standard crop rotation practices combined with improved storage & reduced loss to vermin , is a safer and more effective approach ?
Soil health and productivity increases and is adaptable .
GM suits industrial farmers , not the small holdings of the rural poor whose plight is overlooked by the same GM scientists who claim to want to feed the world .
The inadvertent unleashing of any more , now seemingly unbeatable , superweeds ( glyphosate - resistant ) from the " round up ready " crops and should be halted .
Patrick , Vancouver Canada
I whole heartedly agree with Professor Jones .
It is all very well for those in developed countries to exercise their prejudices but people in poor countries are suffering and if GM can help to alleviate that then lets do it .
Philip S Hall , Northampton England Excellent article , well written , honest and fully grounded in reality .
A great antidote to the usual disinformation peddled by dogmatic fantasists whom for some reason the BBC invariably offers a right of reply to .
Why should Friends of the Earth , Greenpeace or the Soil Association be entitled to present extremist , ill - judged and poorly researched minority views at license payers expense ?
I have a PhD in crop science and many years of professional agronomic experience and know for a fact that Prof Jones is spot on in his observations - giving a balanced view does not mean offering equal time to pressure group spokespeople who are utterly ignorant of our subject and wish to scaremonger at the expense of humanity .
Dr Jim Dimmock , Bodelva , Par , Cornwall , Uk We need to use every tool in the toolbox to control population growth and actually reduce the number of people on this planet .
The world is already grossly overpopulated , unsustainably so .
Overpopulation is the root cause of most of the worlds problems from imminent extinction of so many of the worlds plant , bird and animal species to over exploitation of resources and pollution .
As with climate change ( yet another consequence of overpopulation ) we need to act , and we need to act now .
Neil Beever , Tavira , Portugal
The benefits of GM crops in terms of quantity and reliability of yield are without doubts and could indeed contribute to solving some problems .
But there is more than yields and environmental issues to the whole GM story .
In fact it is the economics of GM which are the particularly obnoxious .
Two questions :
What about the infertility of the seeds , which requires farmers to re-order seeds year in year out from the same company ?
What about the exclusivity of the seeds , which requires farmers to only use specific pesticides and fertilisers , produced by you know who ?
GM seeds - producing companies lock farmers and countries into a monopolistic business model which is damaging for local and national economic development , particularly in the developing world , where farmers are already among the poorest workers .
In other words , from a socio- economic perspective , the use of GM crops are very destructive of local livelihoods .
And destroyed livelihoods are much more conducive to famines than low yield crops .
Nick S. , Torino , Italy
The main argument against GM foods is that it is " unnatural " .
People need to remember that natural is not always better ( and is frequently worse ) .
Natural is dying of some infection at the age of 30 ( on the off chance you managed to make it past infancy ) .
It has been ages since humans lived naturally and I hope this reminds people of all the unnatural benefiets we already enjoy in our society .
Carl de Boer , Toronto , Canada I and hundreds of thousands of EU citizens ( to judge by the Avaaz EU GMO Petition ~ just search with those terms ) certainly do not agree with Prof.
Jones .
Siobhan Winter - Smith , Fairford , Uk Some fear GM food is bad for health / environment .
I fear a monoculture , thousands of acres of the same plant , flowering at the same time , leaving thousands of acres of barren desert once it is cropped .
An annual cycle of monotony .
The impact on nature and wildlife by the individual plant might not be great , but the process leads to a potentially devestating impact .
As to health , in the US , everybody subsists on corn starch or animals fed on corn starch , in the UK its a fairly standard wheat variety .
Again , the individual plant might not be the problem , but if that 's all that is eaten - presented in many and various ways - no wonder we are so unhealthy .
So , GM plant , no problem , GM crop , potential disaster !
There are no data that support this view .
simon Mallett , Lenham Kent
The pro GM argument relies on the concept that somehow there is not already enough food for everyone , and forgets entirely that the problem is distribution and that few people hold the highest percentage of food , while others go hungry .
There 's no proof as of yet that GM foods will solve any fuel or food crisis , and since GM foods are owned by a few companies and not the people , history will show that it will remain a problem controlled by greed and not need .
KK , na GM will always be a divisive issue and the reason is clear : some people do not want to be reliant on corporations .
They would rather be people - centred and promoting self - sufficiency , not profit - centred .
Professor Jones states " But in agriculture , idealism does not solve problems " .
I can think of nothing more idealistic than market capitalism .

LOS ANGELES ( Hollywood Reporter ) -
After the disturbing Mel Gibson audio tapes became public earlier this month , Oksana Grigorieva sent a text to the actor explaining why she ’d surreptitiously recorded their conversations , the Hollywood Reporter has learned .
Actor Mel Gibson poses during the Spanish premiere of the film " Edge of Darkness " in Madrid February 1 , 2010 .
REUTERS / Juan Medina
According to a source familiar with the case , Grigorieva writes in the text that the reason she recorded him was because “ you broke your agreement with me . ”
The source says additional emails will likely be used by Gibson ’s attorneys to prove that Grigorieva attempted to use the audio tapes to extort money from Gibson .
The source adds that Grigorieva was also upset about the breakup and was looking to reconcile .
The Los Angeles County sheriff ’s department on Wednesday confirmed it is investigating Grigorieva .
Based on sealed court documents reviewed by The Hollywood Reporter , it also appears that Grigorieva ’s family law attorney , Manley Freid , has n’t been helping her cause .
At a June 22 court hearing , the judge sharply criticized Freid for obtaining a temporary restraining order the day before for his client , specifically noting Grigorieva ’s failure to tell the court about a previous $ 15 million settlement agreement between herself and Gibson .
“ ( Her lawyer ) did something truly remarkable , ” notes a source close to the case .
“ He did not disclose to the court that there was a settlement agreement between Oksana and Mel . ”
“ Manley Freid ’s strategy accomplished nothing , ” says a source close to the case .
“ It ’s all out there now .
They pressed the nuclear button and Gibson is still basically standing .
There ’s zero upside for Grigorieva in terms of money , custody and visitation . ”
In other words , her whole strategy may have backfired .
Steve Jaffe , a spokesman for Grigorieva , had no comment .
Gibson ’s rep had no comment ; his attorney could not be reached .
The actual transcript from the June 22 court proceedings , reviewed in its entirety by The Hollywood Reporter and excerpted below , reveals that the judge admonished Freid for his failure to inform him about the custody agreement reached between Grigorieva and Gibson .
Judge Gordon : ( addressing Manley Freid ) at the June 22 court hearing :
“ My question for you is this .
Why was n’t I told about this agreement in connection with the request for a temporary restraining order ?
Mr. Kolodny ( Gibson ’s Counsel ) is exactly correct .
Had I known the parties had an agreement , I may not have issued the order the way I did ; and I find it very troubling that someone comes in , without notice to the other side , represents facts to me , including the fact this woman is so afraid of Mr. Gibson that she needs immediate protection , even though by -- based on her declaration , it ’s clear that nothing happened for a few months .
“ The things that happened were so horrible and it was quite understandable to me that she finally came to the conclusion that she needed a restraining order , even though the bad stuff happened in February .
“ But no one then told me there had been this intervening agreement about the child , and I ’m really quite troubled by that . “
Freid then unsuccessfully attempted to persuade the court that the settlement document was irrelevant because Grigorieva entered into the agreement because of false representations and without the advice of a family law attorney :
“ She entered into that document because of false misrepresentations to her ; that she was misadvised .... ”
Judge Gordon responded that not only was he troubled by Freid ’s failure to inform him of the previous settlement agreement , but he found the lawyer ’s arguments “ disingenuous at best ” and “ very disturbing . ”
The judge then proceeded to deny Freid ’s motions and to order the tape recordings of Gibson sealed .
THE Government has changed rules for exploration companies hunting for oil and gas in Irish waters to encourage new operators to search off the Irish coast .
The rules will open up a much larger area to exploration and give companies two years to decide whether they want to drill once they have started looking for oil .
Previous rules forced explorers to spend large sums of money and limited oil companies to an area around the Porcupine Basin off Kerry and the Rockall Basin off Mayo .
" Basically what we want is more exploration and more drilling , " Science Minister Conor Lenihan said after a briefing for oil industry executives yesterday .
" We want to make it less costly and bring in smaller players , " he added .
Ireland owns 10 times more land underneath the sea than above the water but many of the sea basins that contain oil and gas are relatively remote from the mainland and up to 3 km below the surface .
While Ireland is believed to have 10 billion barrels of oil and gas waiting to be exploited , fewer than one out of 30 wells drilled so far has actually struck oil that can be used commercially .
The latest changes to the system governing licences come days after the Dail passed new legislation to make it easier for oil companies to get planning permission while also tightening up safety rules to ease fears similar to those expressed by the opponents of Shell 's operations in Mayo .
Those protests damaged Ireland 's reputation and discouraged exploration companies from looking at Ireland , Mr Lenihan said .
Oil companies now have 12 months to apply to the State for permission to explore up to six blocks each .
The permission will be granted on the basis of their exploration programmes and their experience .
Tax rate
No money changes hands until oil is extracted from the ground and sold .
Mr Lenihan denied the 25 pc tax rate that was levied on oil companies was too low , saying oil companies needed incentives to explore when the successful strike rate was so low .
" This round provides for a different kind of authorisation than previously , " he added .
" In the past , 15 - year licences were issued but they required that a significant investment had to be made within the first two years .
" This round is different in that the offers will be for a two - year period to assess the potential of an area . "
The minister also announced a new collaboration between University College Dublin and Memorial University in Newfoundland to map the sea bed between Ireland and Canada .
The two countries have close ties historically and share geological features .

A " psychic " octopus in Germany , which appears to have correctly predicted every World Cup game involving the national team so far , has picked Spain over Germany in the semi-final .
Paul , from the Sea Life Aquarium in the western city of Oberhausen , chose a mussel from a jar with the Spanish flag instead of one with a German flag .
The two - year - old cephalopod has become a national celebrity .
According to his owners , he has a record of predicting German results .
They say Paul chose the winner in nearly 70 % of Germany 's games during the 2008 European Championship .
He correctly predicted all five of the team 's previous World Cup games - including a shock defeat by Serbia in the group stages .
His prognosis ahead of Wednesday 's World Cup semi-final was broadcast live on German TV .
Correspondents says Paul 's plumping for Spain has caused alarm in the country , but some analysts point out that his predictive powers are not perfect .
During Euro 2008 he wrongly picked Germany as the victor against Spain .

A few years ago , the military began analyzing the shapes of recruits ’ feet .
Injuries during basic training were rampant , and military authorities hoped that by fitting soldiers with running shoes designed for their foot types , injury rates would drop .
Trainees obediently began clambering onto a high - tech light table with a mirror beneath it , designed to help outline a subject ’s foot .
Evaluators classified the recruits as having high , normal or low arches , and they passed out running shoes accordingly .
Many of us have had a similar experience .
For decades , coaches and shoe salesmen have visually assessed runners ’ foot types to recommend footwear .
Runners with high arches have been directed toward soft , well - cushioned shoes , since it ’s thought that high arches prevent adequate pronation , or the inward motion of your foot and ankle as you run .
Pronation dissipates some of the forces generated by each stride .
Flat - footed , low - arched runners , who tend to over - pronate , have typically been told to try sturdy “ motion control ” shoes with firm midsoles and Teutonic support features , while runners with normal arches are offered neutral shoes ( often called “ stability ” shoes by the companies that make and categorize them ) .
But as the military prepared to invest large sums in more arch - diagnosing light tables , someone thought to ask if the practice of assigning running shoes by foot shape actually worked .
The approach was entrenched in the sports world and widely accepted .
But did it actually reduce injuries ?
Military researchers checked the scientific literature and found that no studies had been completed that answered that question , so eventually they decided they would have to mount their own .
They began fitting thousands of recruits in the Army , Air Force and Marine Corps with either the “ right ” shoes for their feet or stability shoes .
Over the course of three large studies , the most recent of which was published last month in The American Journal of Sports Medicine , the researchers found almost no correlation at all between wearing the proper running shoes and avoiding injury .
Injury rates were high among all the runners , but they were highest among the soldiers who had received shoes designed specifically for their foot types .
If anything , wearing the “ right ” shoes for their particular foot shape had increased trainees ’ chances of being hurt .
Scientific rumblings about whether running shoes deliver on their promises have been growing louder in recent years .
In 2008 , an influential review article in The British Journal of Sports Medicine concluded that sports - medicine specialists should stop recommending running shoes based on a person ’s foot posture .
No scientific evidence supported the practice , the authors pointed out , concluding that “ the true effects ” of today ’s running shoes “ on the health and performance of distance runners remain unknown . ”
More recently , a study published online in late June in The British Journal of Sports Medicine produced results similar to those in the military experiments , this time using experienced distance runners as subjects .
For the study , 81 women were classified according to their foot postures , a more comprehensive measure of foot type than arch shape .
About half of the runners received shoes designated by the shoe companies as appropriate for their particular foot stance ( underpronators were given cushiony shoes , overpronators motion - control shoes and so on ) .
The rest received shoes at random .
All of the women started a 13 - week , half - marathon training program .
By the end , about a third had missed training days because of pain , with a majority of the hurt runners wearing shoes specifically designed for their foot postures .
( It ’s worth noting that across the board , motion - control shoes were the most injurious for the runners .
Many overpronators , who , in theory , should have benefited from motion - control shoes , complained of pain and missed training days after wearing them , as did a number of the runners with normal feet and every single underpronating runner assigned to the motion - control shoes . )
The lesson of the newest studies is obvious if perhaps disconcerting to those of us planning to invest in new running shoes this summer .
“ You ca n’t simply look at foot type as a basis for buying a running shoe , ” says Dr. Bruce H. Jones , the manager of the Injury Prevention Program for the United States Army ’s Public Health Command and senior author of the military studies .
The widespread belief that flat - footed , overpronating runners need motion - control shoes and that high - arched , underpronating runners will benefit from well - cushioned pairs is quite simply , he adds , “ a myth . ”
The mythology grew and persists , however , in large part because “ in certain aspects , the shoes do work , ” says Michael Ryan , Ph.D. , the lead author of the study of female half - marathoners and currently a postdoctoral fellow in the department of orthopedics and rehabilitation at the University of Wisconsin , Madison .
Motion - control shoes , for instance , do control motion , he says .
Biomechanical studies of runners on treadmills repeatedly have proved that pronation is significantly reduced in runners who wear motion - control shoes .
The problem is that “ no one knows whether pronation is really the underlying issue , ” Dr. Jones says .
Few scientific studies have examined how or even if over - or underpronation contributes to running injuries .
“ There is so much that we still do n’t understand about the biomechanics of the lower extremities , ” Dr. Jones concludes .
For now , if you ’re heading out to buy new running shoes , plan to be your own best advocate .
“ If a salesperson says you need robust motion - control shoes , ask to try on a few pairs of neutral or stability shoes , too , ” Mr. Ryan says .
“ Go outside and run around the block ” in each pair .
“ If you feel any pain or discomfort , that ’s your first veto . ”
Hand back those shoes .
Try several more pairs .
“ There really are only a few pairs that will fit and feel right ” for any individual runner , he says .
“ My best advice is , turn on your sensors and listen to your body , not to what the salespeople might tell you . ”
This week , Symantec reported its discovery of a veritable thieves horde : a server holding the login info of 44,000,000 stolen MMORPG accounts .
After surveying a few websites , Symantec came up with a range of values for the data on the server , capping out at around $ 30,000 .
If you ’re not a regular online gamer , you may be wondering why game accounts are so valuable .
At the very least , you might be wondering why someone would go to the trouble of grabbing the log in info for so many accounts that they have to craft a unique program simply to figure out which ones still work .
As a regular World of Warcraft player with account security on the brain , allow me to give you a brief explanation .
Gold Farming : It Exists
Gold farming is the inevitable byproduct of any popular online game that has an in - game economy .
In most games , an in - game item must be earned through some sort of in - game effort .
However , if the item can be traded or bought in the virtual world , you can guarantee that someone in the real world is willing to give you the virtual item ( perhaps a true “ item ” like a weapon or piece of armor , or perhaps simply an amount of in - game currency ) if you agree to give them real money for it .
Hence , gold selling , and its resource gathering twin , gold farming .
It ’s worth mentioning at this point that buying virtual items for real money is not illegal .
It is , however , against the Terms of Service of most major MMORPGs , and if a player is caught doing so , it will result in the banning of their account .
( A gold black market is pretty universal across MMO ’s , unless , of course , the gamemakers take an end - run around the whole problem by selling in - game items for out - of - game cash themselves .
* ahem * )
How To ( Illicitly ) Get Gold
If you really want an in - depth , if outsidery , explanation of the logistics of Gold Farming , look no further than this New York Times Magazine article from 2007 .
Basically , your average gold farmer ’s work day is n’t too different from your average sweatshop worker ’s day .
Long , underpaid , monotonous , and stigmatized .
The manager of the operation sells the gold collected by a few workers grinding boars for twelve hours * ( remember that scene in the South Park World of Warcraft episode ? ) to an online retailer , who then sells the gold to players .
Note that this involves significant manpower and a lengthy supply chain .
Gold farmers also run the risk that their accounts will be detected as gold farming accounts by the game authorities , and banned .
Which is where we get to account hacking .
Why grind for hours picking up coins and scraps of cloth when you can take advantage of some idiot who clicked on the wrong link ?
After all , 11.5 million people play World of Warcraft .
That ’s a lot of potential misguided clicks .
Trojan the right computer , and you could have a max - leveled character in pristine armor sitting on a respectable nest egg in minutes , instead of months .
As a WoW player , I can tell you a bit about how Blizzard has reacted to reduce the impact that gold selling has on its game .
World of Warcraft has been live since 2004 , and its had a lot of time to evolve since then .
Blizzard took a lot of the random chance out of acquiring wealth by creating repeatable quests that have a guaranteed effort / reward ratio .
It has also created a number of simple methods that allow players to report phishing scams in in - game mail ( yes , they exist ) , and in - game gold seller advertisements ( usually they take the form of private tells , or , no joke , spelling out the site url in dead characters ) .
As the stewards of a virtual universe , the Blizzard team puts a lot of effort and thought towards stabilizing the in game economy , recognizing that if the economy is skewed , players are more likely to turn to illicit methods to obtain the goods they want for their characters .
In the interest of full disclosure , I should mention that Blizzard has recently begun to sell in game items for real money , though they have pledged that they will never sell an item that has an effect on gameplay mechanics , such as a weapon ; limiting themselves to vanity items like little pets and sparkleponies .
The Effect
I rarely hear much anymore about gold farmer sightings ( one badly equipped character who does n’t respond to tells killing one kind of monster in one place for hours upon hours upon hours ) .
The community is now much more focused on account security : keeping your characters out of the hands of hackers .
Since the characters that you have poured time and effort in to technically belong to Blizzard , and not you , the company is not legally required to fix the damage that can be caused to an account by someone who wants to gut it for it ’s gold content .
Of course , if they did n’t , it ’d be a PR nightmare , so you can usually count on getting your stuff back eventually .
This sort of thing has made me much more careful about my World of Warcraft login info than , say , my bank info .
If my real world identity is stolen , there are laws to protect me .
Not so much for my virtual selves .
Welcome to the future :
We promise it ’s not so bad once you get used to it .
Blizzard has even developed a security token for use with your account , accomplishing the dual goals of assuaging user stress and keeping them from having to spend even more time restoring accounts .
Why Gold Selling Still Works
Why does gold selling work ?
Why is it still around despite the best efforts of game publishers ?
Because people want to buy gold .
Note that Blizzard ’s first response to the problem was to make it easier for players to get gold , not harder for sellers to get gold .
As long as there is a market for their product , gold selling will be around , and account hacking is currently the method du jour .
And that ’s why some loser has 44 million passwords on his server somewhere , worth up to $ 30,000 .
( via 1UP . )
* Well , okay , not boars , because animals do n’t drop coins , but you see my point .
Have a tip we should know ?

Shin splints are a tricky injury to discuss .
There ’s no clear cure and every runner will respond differently to various treatment options .
I ’m even hesitant to call shinsplints an “ injury ” – sore shins simply do n’t qualify in my book .
Shinsplints are more like persistent soreness .
Since they can often significantly limit your training , I want to discuss how to get rid of shin splints and also how to prevent them before you have sore shins .
Most of the time , shin splints affect new runners or those who do n’t run consistently .
If you ’re just starting up or find yourself taking long breaks in between training blocks , you ’re at an increased risk for this annoying little injury .
Shin splints are essentially a nagging soreness caused by too much stress to the shin muscles .
Runners report pain on both the anterior and interior of the tibia – basically , both sides of the shin bone .
I had severe shin splints when I first started running .
Curiously , I only had sore shins when I was running a fast workout on the track .
A great definition and list of shin splints causes can be found on Wikipedia .
I ’m not going to reinvent the wheel here .
What I want to do is take a running - specific look at how to get rid of shinsplints through changes in your training .
Small changes can make a big difference when it comes to your susceptibility to shin splints and other injuries .
How to Get Rid of Shin splints : Your Treatment Plan
There are several reasons why you may be getting shin splints so one of these treatment options may not work for you .
My recommendation is to experiment with all of these suggestions and if you can , implement them all .
They ’re good for shin splint treatment , prevention , and work well for other injuries too .
They have helped me get rid of shin splints in the past and I hope they work for you too .
Introduce more variety in your program .
Rotate 2 - 3 pairs of shoes , run on varied terrain like trails and hills , and do n’t run the same speed every day .
Constantly challenge your body .
Avoid the “ three too ’s ” – too much , too soon , too fast .
Sudden increases in volume or intensity can over - stress your shins making you more susceptible to sore shins .
Do n’t tie your shoes so tight .
Doing so can restrict the movement of your shin muscles and tendons where they attach to your ankle .
If you wear very bulky trainers , you could be at a higher risk of aggressively heel striking or slapping your foot down on the ground .
Wear a pair of minimalist running shoes ( I train in the Saucony Kinvara ’s and New Balance 101 ’s ) for 1 - 3 runs per week to strengthen your lower legs and feet .
Do n’t run cold .
Warm - up before you head out the door with a dynamic flexibility routine .
Your muscles work better when they are warm and primed to work .
Consistency is king .
If you regularly take significant breaks from running then your body is not being trained to adapt to the stress of running .
Be more consistent with your training and your body wo n’t rebel as frequently .
Strengthen your lower legs with barefoot strides , slow barefoot running ( not too much ! ) on a soft surface , and avoiding shoes with a very high heel .
You should also be doing a consistent strength routine .
If you ’re stuck on a good routine , I highly recommend the Injury Prevention for Runners program .
Ice your shins .
This may seem like a no - brainer , but I ’m astounded by the number of people who disregard the power of ice .
Use a paper cup and peel the paper back at the top to expose about an inch of ice .
Massage your shin muscles for 10 - 20 minutes .
Also , ice - baths are my favorite .
Just make sure to use enough ice .
Correct your form by having a high stride - rate , landing on your mid-foot underneath your hips , and keeping your back tall as you run .
If you are going to choose only one suggestion here , pick this one .
Finally , have patience .
Sometimes sore shins just happen and unless the pain is severe or sharp , you can train through it .
Stay tough .
Like I mentioned , some of these treatment plans may not work for you .
Treating injuries , and also running , is largely a trial and error game .
The more options you experiment with , the more success you ’ll experience .
If you really need to learn how to get rid of shin splints then you should experiment with many of these strategies .
I ’ve found what works for me : trails , increasing my cadence , running more hills , and consistency with core and other strength work .
I have n’t had a major injury in over two years and I ’m still going strong .
I ’ve learned when to take it easy and when to run hard .
It took me 12 years , but I guess I ’m a slow learner .
There ’s no magic bullet when it comes to shin splints , so remember # 8 above .
Consistently practice these suggestions , be patient , and shin splints will soon be a distant memory .
One warning : if your shin pain is severe , sharp , or lasts for longer than a month , you should get it checked out by a professional .
You could have compartment syndrome ; not something you want to run through .

The Gnomon School of Visual Effects was launched on the premise that those who are actively working in the special effects industry would be in the best position to train others working in the industry , and a classroom setting where pros teach other pros would be the best way to bring about a grand sharing of techniques and ideas .
Soon after the school opened for admission , however , it turned out that most of the applications were from folks who wanted to get into the industry — not people who were already in the business and looking to learn new skills .
Furthermore , many students entered wanting to work in the world of video games , rather than television or movies .
But if you 'd like to do any of these things , there are few places better suited to build your skills and find a job .
I was invited to tour the school during my time in Los Angeles for E3 , and I jumped at the chance to check out where the people who make games are trained .
My tour guide was Alex Alvarez , the Gnomon 's founder and director .
I said that I could give up a few hours early in the morning before E3 began , and the PR rep seemed a little taken aback .
" Alex is an artist , " I was told .
" He 's not going to like getting up that early . "
Alvarez met me at Gnomon at 8:30 in the morning , bleary eyed , holding a cup of coffee as if it were a life preserver .
The school 's stats are impressive : 350 students , and a 98 percent placement rate .
The instructors are all working professionals from studios , so they know how the industry is now , not what it was like before they left it to begin teaching .
" Every night they 're driving in from Sony or Blizzard or Activision , " Alvarez tells me .
" Dreamworks , Digital Domain ... "
This is something that is constantly stressed : you are being taught by people in the industry .
Let 's take a look at what makes Gnomon School of Visual Effects so special .
Gnomon has stayed in the same facility since it began , and art is everywhere you see .
While the students were on break during my visit , all the areas appeared lived - in .
Video games filled the halls .
You could see where people relaxed , watched movies , and talked about their work .
This is the reception area .
In the store you can buy these Gnomon - made instructional DVDs , which are also available online .
You are given techniques and tricks directly from some of the biggest names in all the areas of special effects design and art .
Israel 's Army Radio reported on Wednesday that the United States has sent Israel a secret document committing to nuclear cooperation between the two countries .
According to Army Radio , the U.S. has reportedly pledged to sell Israel materials used to produce electricity , as well as nuclear technology and other supplies , despite the fact that Israel is not a signatory of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty .
Other countries have refused to cooperate with Israel on nuclear matters because it has not signed the NPT , and there has been increasing international pressure for Israel to be more transparent about its nuclear arsenal .
Army Radio's diplomatic correspondent said the reported offer could put Israel on a par with India , another NPT holdout which is openly nuclear - armed but in 2008 secured a U.S. - led deal granting it civilian nuclear imports .
During Tuesday 's meeting between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and U.S. President Barack Obama , the two leaders discussed the global challenge of nuclear proliferation and the need to strengthen the nonproliferation system .
They also discussed calls for a conference on a nuclear - free Middle East , which was peoposed during the 2010 Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NTP ) review conference in New York and which Netanyahu said he would not take part in because it intends to single out Israel .
Obama informed Netanyahu that , as a co-sponsor charged with enabling the proposed conference , the United States will insist that such a conference have a broad agenda to include regional security issues , verification and compliance and discussion of all types of weapons of mass destruction .
Obama emphasized the conference will only take place if all countries " feel confident that they can attend , " and said that efforts to single out Israel would make the prospects of such a conference unlikely .
The two leaders agreed to work together to oppose efforts to single out Israel at the IAEA General Conference in September .
Obama emphasized that the U.S. will continue to work closely with Israel to ensure that arms control initiatives and policies do not detract from Israels security , and " support our common efforts to strengthen international peace and stability . "
Dan Meridor , Netanyahu 's deputy prime minister in charge of nuclear affairs , said Obama 's endorsement was not new but that its public expression - two months after Washington supported Egypt 's proposal at a review conference of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) - was significant .
Obama 's statement " was without a doubt a special and significant text .
It was important for us , and it was important for the region , " Meridor said .
Israel neither confirms nor denies having nuclear weapons under an " ambiguity " strategy billed as warding off foes while avoiding public provocations that can spark regional arms races .
The official reticence , and its toleration in Washington , has long aggrieved many Arabs and Iranians - especially given U.S. - led pressure on Tehran to rein in its nuclear program .
A growing number of executives running N.B.A. franchises incorporate knowledge about what happens on the basketball court and in the courtroom , while others bring advanced college degrees to their work .
Together , they have created what the Portland Trail Blazers ’ owner , Paul Allen , termed “ the new generation of N.B.A. executives . ”
Allen hired Rich Cho as his general manager earlier this month .
A day later , the Phoenix Suns introduced Lon Babby , a prominent agent , as their president of basketball operations .
Both Cho and Babby pursued law degrees before delving into basketball full time .
Cho started as an intern with the Seattle SuperSonics 15 years ago .
Neither Cho , 44 , nor Babby , 59 , claims to have all the answers for success in the league .
But their legal backgrounds could serve them well in those moments when the basketball court and the courtroom intersect , particularly in arbitration cases .
They should certainly come in handy when the league ’s collective bargaining agreement , which expires after next season , is renegotiated , requiring a new encyclopedia of details , many of them highly nuanced .
With some N.B.A. teams staggering economically , there is a heightened emphasis on an executive ’s ability to allocate resources properly .

Controversy seized the blogosphere in mid-July when Vaseline introduced a Facebook application to promote a line of skin- whitening products for males in India .
The “ Transform Your Face on Facebook ” tool allows Indian social networkers to digitally lighten their skin in photographs .
If they like what they see , they can purchase the face cream that produces the same effect in real life .
“ The response has been pretty phenomenal , ” said campaign spokesperson Pankaj Parihar in an Adelaide Now report .
Skin - whitening is a major industry in India .
Research agency Nielson estimated that it is worth $ 500 million and is growing rapidly .
Originally , lightening products were designed exclusively for women , but in 2005 , Indian company Emami introduced the popular “ Fair and Handsome ” skin cream for men .
L’Oreal , Revlon , Garnier , and other foreign cosmetic companies quickly caught on to the trend .
According to Nielson , sales of men ’s products increased by 25 percent last year , and women ’s by 17 percent .
“ It ’s all lower - middle - class men who want the product now , ” said Indian pharmacist Ajay Gupta in a Washington Post report last year .
“ What it really means is that the young and up - and - coming Indian male wants to look fair and therefore rich . ”
In the past , higher castes in India were associated with fairer skin tones .
The rich aimed to emulate their British colonial rulers .
Last year , a Vaseline slogan promised the use of the company ’s “ Lightening Body Milk ” would result in “ an Aryan glow from head to toes . ”
Bollywood stars are consistently fair - skinned — actor Shahid Kapoor was the face of Vaseline ’s new campaign .
Skin tone is considered a make - or - break trait among many young Indians looking for romance .
In a poll by the online dating site Shaadi last year , people from three Indian states chose skin tone as the most important characteristic in a partner .
Twenty - four - year - old Ashu Kumar told Agence France - Presse , “ My skin is too dark .
If I do n’t make it fairer , I ’m worried I ’ll have trouble finding a woman to marry me . ”
Critics of Vaseline ’s facebook application have called it racist and oppressive .
Vaseline responded to a CBS News report by saying , “ Vaseline is committed to creating culturally relevant products that meet the needs of its consumers in markets around the world .
Much like self - tanning products in North America and Europe , skin lightening products are culturally relevant in India . ”
In a Wall Street Journal blog , economist Rupa Dehejia similarly questioned , “ How is the use of skin - whitening creams any different from applying suntan or bronzing lotions to look tanned ?
Or anti-wrinkle creams to smooth skin ?
Or Botox to look younger ? ”
She responded to claims that young Indians are still bound to colonial ideals by saying , “ To assume that Indian and Asian consumers are somehow misinformed and brainwashed into buying these products but their counterparts in the West are behaving rationally is the real colonial mentality . ”
Others insist that companies such as Vaseline are perpetuating the idea that a Western appearance is a superior one .
New Dehli artist Nikki Duggal creates t- shirts that say “ Dark and Lovely ” and “ Fair and Ugly . ”
An editorial in The Hindu reminded readers , “ There is no perfect formula for beauty and , hopefully , a dark skin shall not remain on the margin of the beauty page for long . ”

" I went to the police but there was n't much they could do as , at this stage , the phone could n't be considered stolen , " Devery , an executive assistant at ANZ , said .
Unable to get an answer when calling the phone , and with time of the essence , Devery decided to take matters into her own hands and go to the address and knock on the door herself .
" [ The police officer ] told me to do that , and if it was n't the taxi driver to call back and he would consider the phone stolen , " she said .
Devery and her mother , Cathie , drove to the house in Box Hill and Devery knocked on the door nervously .
She says that if the phone had been stolen " it may not have been the smartest idea in the world to rock up at the thief 's house " .
A woman answered and confirmed that her husband drove a taxi and had been working the night before .
Devery said she had come to get her phone back .
" She went and got her husband , an older Greek taxi driver with very broken English , to whom I explained the situation and asked for my phone back , " she said .
" He said he did n't have it .
I asked if I could look in his cab .
He said the cab was n't there . "
Devery explained that she had tracked the phone to his address , but the driver said that was impossible and repeatedly denied that he had seen the phone .
" He suggested it might be in the cab , which was at the depot , but I knew it was n't because the tracking service had given me his address , not the depot address - and I had my sister log in only minutes before I knocked on his door to make sure it was still there , " Devery said .
" So in the end I gave him my phone number , took his phone number and told mum in a very offhandish matter , whilst he was in earshot , that I would just have to call the police back now that it was a ' criminal matter ' . "
Devery and her mother got back in the car and called the police officer to give him the news .
As they were talking , the driver ran across the road to his car ( not the taxi ) .
" I was yelling at mum ' follow him mum , pursue him !' - and then informed [ the police officer ] that we were in pursuit of the taxi driver : he was currently on foot , and we had a visual , " Devery said .
She called her sister Cate for an update on where her iPhone was and Cate confirmed it was on the move .
But the pair were too slow and the taxi driver got away .
Fortunately , Cate was able to keep track of the phone through MobileMe and provide directions .
" Mum admitted at this stage that it was pretty exciting and I started calling her Watson ( because I was Sherlock ) , " Devery said .
They eventually tracked the driver to Middleborough Road and pulled up a block from where he had stopped .
" We did n't really know what we were doing , or what to do next , but then he called me , " Devery said .
" I asked whether he had found my phone and he said not yet but he was just about to check . "
The driver then pretended to look for the phone for several minutes before announcing he had found it .
" He asked where I was , and I told him I was on Middleborough Road .
He sounded a bit surprised and a bit nervous as he disclosed that he was also on Middleborough Road , " she said .
Devery approached the car and got her phone back , but declined the police officer 's offer to press charges .
Loading " I think he got a scare from the whole experience and I could n't live with myself if he lost his job as a result , " she said .
Tim O’Reilly and Aneesh Chopra , Federal Chief Technology
Officer sit down for a chat on the US government ’s goals on open data and information accessibility .
Disregard the infomercial feel to it .
There ’s some interesting tidbits in there , albeit pretty broad .
Uses for data
Chopra brings up two examples on how the government is getting involved , and what ’s interesting about them is that it ’s not what most have in mind .
It ’s not about money matters or policy - making .
The first is an anecdote about a physician with a patient who moved away to a different state .
The physician would like to transfer the patient ’s health records to a physician in the patient ’s new state .
There ’s no way to do it directly , so he exports a file and sends it through email over the non-secure connection .
Not good .
The government , however , has been working with groups on building an infrastructure where your health records can be transferred , with your permission to your new health provider , quickly and securely .
Second example , simply put , is a way for consumers to access their energy consumption .
Only the big companies know now .
So it ’s not just about transparency , Data.gov , and all that jazz .
It ’s also about setting up the technology to make stuff easier to get at .
So after one and a half years , what ’s the biggest accomplishment ?
Chopra says it ’s is the culture change in open data .
His biggest concern moving forward ?
Cyber security .
Watch the full 15 - minute interview below .
A Pedestrian ’s Prerogatives ?
From the very outset , let ’s be perfectly clear …
Pedestrians on our city streets are assured the inalienable and basic human right to safe and secure access to our public spaces …
Except when this access encroaches upon the open roadways , and contrary to traffic laws of course .
The key issue here is the assurance of the Personal Responsibility required from all road users in assuring the protection of each other and ourselves .
So if everyone is keeping public safety first in mind , then many other issues can more easily fall into place by default …
Especially if we could evolve some of our traffic flow protocols along the way , once we can assure that the basics are being properly respected !
So what we ’d like to consider here are not ways to limit the free reign that Pedestrians enjoy at Green lights ( and sometimes abuse , just like any others on the road ) , but rather how Pedestrians can be more aware and participative in contributing to the smooth flow of traffic when things get abit tricky .
Thus making our streets safer for everyone .
Of course we ’ll be looking at this from the Cyclists point of view , and focusing on the one tool that we have to communicate danger to Pedestrians by learning to use our bike bells in a way that Pedestrians can appreciate , and respond more positively to …Perhaps from there maybe even considering a few basic signals as well
Sticking to the Sidewalk
We ’ve already warned “ Sidewalk Sissies ” of the dangers of riding their bikes where only Pedestrians and children ’s bikes belong , but perhaps the point should be presented again for anybody who disagrees about the dangers of mixing Pedestrians and Cyclists on our walkways .
Meanwhile back on the streets … Unless we ’re talking about some sleepy little ‘ Burb where lawns are manicured right to the edge of the street and kids play on tricycles right in the road , all streets ( here in Ontario ) provide Pedestrians with at least 1.5 meters of ample and accessible sidewalk width , and safe crossing points at all intersections .
People might complain about the creation of a dedicated bikelanes ( that might not always be full of traffic ) but nobody ever thinks twice about the need for 5 foot - wide sidewalks along both sides of every road , regardless of how much or little traffic they see .
It ’s just rightly presumed that foot traffic is provided universal access , as well as the right of passage where it intersects with the road .
Unfortunately it seems as though this universal right of way has also bred complacency and perhaps even a false sense of entitlement .
The result is that ‘ jaywalking ’ and leading the lights at intersections has become a standard practice by most Pedestrians , who clearly do n;t see consequences to their actions .
Let ’s start with how this sense of impunity impacts Cyclists , and just extrapolate from there on how Pedestrians contribute to traffic jamming in general , as we consider what responsibilities everyone should take to safely share our roads …
Road Hazards
Urban Cyclists are constantly contending with car traffic , which we ’ve already presumed is not going to hear many bike bells to begin with , so warning Pedestrians of danger seems to be the purpose that our bells are best suited for .
The cruel irony is that the people who are most oblivious to dangers in traffic are invariable the ones who are also wearing headphones .
Coincidence ?
Of those who can hear an approaching bike bell , most will be astounded by how quickly you can be on top of them as they leisurely amble out of harms way , once they realize that standing in the roadway can be dangerous .
Worse yet are the ones who are blindly jaywalking right into your path , and then freeze as soon as they hear you coming …
Almost always stopping exactly in the space that you need to safely get by them .
This ‘ deer in the headlights ‘ phenomenon either forces you out into the other traffic lane , or requires you to come to a dead stop .
Personally I ’ve found that just letting these traffic hazards continue to amble on their oblivious way across the middle of streets is the way to go .
This makes it easier to simply ride around them from behind without risking the effects of even more chaos suddenly being thrown into the mix by actually alerting them to their clueless crossing habits – as they suddenly startle themselves upon re-entry into the Real World around them .
So the only solution I ’ve found between these extremes is either let Pedestrians get far enough across my bow for a silent ( and possibly startling ) wraparound pass rather than risk having them freeze in my lane , or give my bell three quick and sharp dings ( according to the ‘ naval standard ” ) as soon as I spot a careless / jaywalking Pedestrian who ’s crossing my path , and leave them to recognize their own next logical move …
Which hopeful ( but rarely enough ) is to actually pick up their pace and get themselves off the damned street , where there are already enough existing hazards to contend with .
Right of Way ?
Incidentally … Based on how often I ’ve seen people walk right to the middle of the road and expect cars to stop for them , it seems that jaywalking is slowly turned into another presumed Human Right in our modern society .
Perhaps this is just the result of regulatory lassitude , similar to Cyclists presuming to run reds .
Or maybe it ’s the result of some people trying to flaunt their non-conformist disdain for crosswalks and traffic lights .
I personally suspect that it ’s just plain laziness .
Then again , maybe Jaywalkers are subconsciously trying to make their own personal stand against Car Culture , by extending the Pedestrian ’s right of way to cover every part of the road now , rather than just acting as an impediment to proper traffic flow during late crossings of intersections .
In any case , our bike bells really only offer functional purpose with Pedestrians who have the strongest sense social responsibility and awareness , or at the very least a healthy sense of self preservation .
As for the rest , even the Darwinistic laws of natural selection get thwarted by good Public Health care at our shared expense …
So it ’s best to just try to reform them one close call at a time .
So on that spartan sociological note , does anyone want to take this tricky subject out for a spin on our Bike Paths ?
Hmnnn
… On second thought .
If you think our city streets are chaotic , then you might want to stay off of Toronto ’s Bike ( erm ) Multi - Use Paths this Summer until the parallel / strolling traffic dies down .
You might also want to wait until all those new and inexperienced E - Bike riders put their shiny new toys away at the first hint of cold weather .
Keeping in mind that with all the ‘ earbuds ’ out there ambling around without a sense of anything that is n’t in front of them , even the loudest bells will be nearly useless when trying to warn the clueless of any consequences to their actions .
Maybe we still really need to work on our basic bike bell protocols before we tempt fate on crowded paths … Perhaps we could also look at how things work elsewhere around the world where they still grasp the safety value of proper ‘ lane discipline ’ , as we consider how to establish some good home - grown solutions to some of our own bad North - American traffic habits .
God knows that I could stand to work on my own tolerance for other people ’s self - centered behavior in the meantime …
Best luck to all in safely exercising their ‘ perogatives ’ as well .

Today I released the version 0.8 of FireGPG .
I removed Gmail support and since I do n’t have anymore time to work on FireGPG I put it officially in ‘ discontinued ’ state .
I updated locates with latest translations and every other features of FireGPG ( eg.inline features , key management ) will still work .
Gmail support was too hackish and I ’m not using Gmail for a long time , so … I ’m tired of constantly adapt FireGPG for Gmail ’s update , getting mail and mail about the same problem .
Sorry .
FireGPG was my first released - and - used project with more than 555000 installations since version 0.4.5 and ~ 30’000 regular users ( who update the extension ) .
A lot of work has been spend on it and the project is now more than 3 years old .
That great :)
Thanks everyone for bugs reports , features suggestions , patches , donations and .. using it ( “ . )
great job ….. too bad you quit , expectially if your worked harder because of gmail … sure it s hackish and its stupid to use gmail and wanning it to be secure … every body know gmail its google and it mean now safe !!!
stop working on gmail and please keep on your project ……. come on …. security and gmail are not compatible weak up ….
ilonna , 2011-01-01 19:08:21
Thank you for a GREAT FF extension and all the time and work you spent in the development .
And double thanks for your kindness in letting your fans know that you cannot carry on development .
There are many software developers who are not so caring as you and leave their users wondering the dark ..
All the best
vava , 2010-07-17 06:34:14
I loved FireGPG .
It ’d be okay to drop Gmail support .
As has been said above , many privacy minded people do n’t use gmail anyway or can switch to a different service .
But dropping the entire plugin is a shame .
IMO , this is one of the top 3 best firefox plugins ( Yslow & firebug being the others ) !

Oh noes :((
I was so happy to find this , only to discover it was already discontinued .
I really need something like the InLine function of this plugin for a website I ’m developing .
Please , someone , continue to maintain this plugin , it is of great value .

OMG this is such a huge loss to the community .
I cant express how thankful I was for this being developed and now I ’m so sad to see it die .
This was the one unifying interface for PGP across all three platforms .
Ugh !!!
Someone please pick this up and bring it back to life !
Drop gmail and just stick to the standard inline stuff .
Shoot , even just using the editor is fine because of the cross platform - ness !

Thanks Maximilien for all the hard work you ’ve been doing .
FireGPG is important part of our system so I definitely hope someone will pick it up from where you left off .
Though I double gmail unsupport , I never really used it for that anyway , but I did see how much trouble it was causing to you .
Cheers !
Aurimas M , 2010-06-08 17:27:30
That ’s unfortunate .
I was content with the inline GPG processing although Gmail support was nice , got used to not using it as much as just manually encrypting the message .
I hope someone can carry on this idea .
Any takers ?
antitree , 2010-06-08 17:50:40
Thanks again !
I did n’t actually use firegpg as much as I would have liked to .
I had a lot more ideas for it than I ever had a chance to investigate .
I tried briefly to find a not too painful way to use it with Google Wave .
However , it turned out to be cumbersome .
Its too bad , this is exactly the sort of thing that is needed to actually bring security to webmail clients .
Its nice that nobody can read your SSL connection but … why should I have to trust my webmail provider with the content of the mail ?
I hope that somebody takes up the torch on this one .
Has anyone expressed interest ?

That ’s such a shame , as it ’s an awesome addon .
I wish I had the programming expertise to carry on developing this program .

Many thanks for FireGPG .
It was very good indeed for me , as a Gmail user , and I ’m sorry to see it go .

Dominik , 2010-06-07 10:59:09
I ’m very sad to see this go , I guess I will need to carry my netbook more often with Thunderbird and enigmail .
It ’s been a good run , I too hated the constant gmail changes but it was still somewhat useful at times .
Well
At least I still use it to sign texts .
Casey , 2010-06-07 14:16:50
I have Open Source projects available at Internet .
I know the problems and difficulties to make it .
So , I understand your decision and would like to say thanks a lot for your nice work .
Good lucky !

I just installed firegpg a week ago , but i’d like to thank you for donating your time and devoloping firegpg : -)

Could somebody take this project ?
It is most useful to ensure privacy .
I would appreciate if somebody could continue .

Yet another user very sorry to see this go .
I understand there has to be balance in life , and devoting time and energy has to show a return on the investment made .
May I wish you all the best going forward , and looking to see what else you craft over time .
Abe A. , 2010-06-17 11:18:38
Yet another user very sorry to see this go .
I have yet to encrypt or sign a single email exchanged with another user , but I had hoped that I had found the right tool to start introducing the concepts to my friends and family .
Thanks again for all your work .
Perhaps someone can keep it going on Google Code or Sourceforge .
Steve , 2010-06-10 14:36:30
Well , I ’m also another user who liked it although the small problems it had , so all I can say is thank you for the time you spent on this project .
All I hope is that somebody may retake it later as that ’s the good thing of Free Software .

I completely understand that you and FireGPG have gone separate ways .
Sorry to hear it , but such is life .
Thank you for your work , and for the fact that FireGPG filled a niche that I will miss .
Maybe the next person to write such an application can begin where you left off , rather than starting from scratch .
Like others here , it worked for me .
Thank you again .
Bob_Robertson , 2010-06-08 04:27:26
Really sorry to hear this I really loved FireGPG and have used it since day one .
I really wish you would have continued to support it but as your time is not free , as no ones is I understand .
Thanks for all the hard work you put into this software over the years .
I would have loved if you continued supporting it just without the gmail function all together , as in my opinion all the most users do n’t use gmail anyway .
Regardless thanks again , your work did n’t go un-appreciated .
Best of luck to you in your future endeavors .

It ’s the worst news for me .
Today , the office network is monitored by someone .
And , firegpg comes out at my first thought .
But , it can not be found in firefox ’s plugins .
What a day !
HeartBroken , 2011-01- 14 03:47:18
Sorry to hear that , hope in near future you get back on the developing or anyone else do it :)
Maybe with this loss someone will get your work and make it better .
That ’s the best part of being an Open Source Software .

Thanks for your efforts , your extension makes GPG much more accessible and usable and that should not be underestimated .
If you every rethink your decision to discontinue it I would suggest losing the gmail functionality altogether and focus on the other functions you can maintain control over .

I see a lot of people being sorry about seeing FireGPG go , how about we stop being sorry users and contribute more to the project instead .
You do n’t want to see it go then contribute to the code !!!!

Instead of trying to integrate with the GMAIL interface it would better if copy and pasting was automated .

andy , 2010-06-10 05:39:41
I too am terribly saddened to see this one go .
I wish there was a place where all of us could go and each contribute a little to have you maintain this program .
I am totally at a loss .
But THANK YOU for your efforts !
It is easy to understand how gmail drove you as the developer of this project to the brink , and I ’m sorry for my part in that , since my wish would be to keep using the gmail web interface ( Its soooo easy ! ) , but also the contradictory desire to start using keys with as many friends as possible ….. guess I will have to learn thunderbird !
saddened , 2011-02-24 03:46:16
First , thanks for all the hard work .
I used FireGPG when it first came out for INLINE encryption successfully not only with GMail but also with Yahoo & HotMail successfully .
INLINE only was not the problem many think it was - GPGOL also does only INLINE and Thunderbird +
Enigmail can handle it .
Signing was always a problem no matter what webmail service was being used .
That was not your fault - the webmail kept putting in specious characters into the message AFTER the signing was done .
The webmail interfaces also did it after encryption some of the time but signing was impossible because they always threw in those extra characters .
I tried telling others that at the start of the FireGPG project but my message probably got lost in all of the excitement .
But as long as you just used the main FireGPG controls and ignored what they kept changing in GMail it worked to send INLINE encrypted messages unless the web - mail inserted characters fouled up the decryption ( usually they did n’t ) .
I never did use the FireGPG controls you built into GMail itself since keeping track of those which were always changing and the ones I used for HotMail & Yahoo required too much effort .
So I just used the same generic controls you provided for all of the WebMail services .
Thanks for all the hard work .
Henry Hertz Hobbit , 2010-07-10 18:38:56

Bummer .
I only recently learned about FireGPG and was looking forward to using it .
We desperately need a way to work with strong encryption in web space beyond just the “ cathedral ” style of the current PKI suite of functions and key sets .

Today when firefox told me about a new update in firegpg , I´ve got excited .
But now it´s sad to know it was discontinued .
Considering the number of comments there´s no need to say how important this add - on is .
Thank you for the amazing job !!
Felipe , 2010-06-09 15:51:45
I also thank you very much ( and expressed that earlier also with donation ) .
What is now the path ?
Somebody actively took over yet ?
Or is there an alternative somebody switched to ?
I have seen that there are two related github sites : http://github.com/SvenDowideit/fireGPG
( this is the one you mentioned ) and http://github.com/firegpg/firegpg
not sure what is most applicable .
Martin Wildam , 2010-07-13 10:31:54
FireGPG is an excellent plugin that makes GPG so much more accessible to users .
I can see a not too distant future when it becomes a standard browser feature .
May you name blaze in glory for your work !
andrewmuck , 2010-07-16 15:50:22
Excellent work to date on this extension - it is indeed a pity that life has to intercede .
It ’s tough with open source projects though .
This truly is one of the better Firefox extensions to surface as there ’s so little in the web - based email PGP arena .
We recommended this plug in for use in many of our tunnel and proxy products .
Thank you Sven for importing this into github - I ’ll bet we could get some community development support for this .
We might even be able to sponsor it ’s development to some degree .
Congrats again on the success thus far and good luck with your new endeavors .
Lockfox , 2010-07-02 15:57:05
Let this be a lesson to those of us who use great programs like FireGPG and think , “ I do n’t need to donate .
It works great as it is without my money . ”
It may then , but it wo n’t CONTINUE to .
I ’m willing to bet a large majority of the folks lamenting its discontinuation on this page did n’t donate to help keep the tool they loved so much going .
I know I did n’t …and frankly I ’m ashamed .
FireGPG ’s discontinuation has put a serious dent in the way I use Gmail .
I wish I would have given to its cause …

Once FF was installed the first addon I went looking for is Firegpg .
You have done an amazing job !
i know that we wo n’t see an other addon like yours anytime soon .
Thank you !
Pnocturne , 2010-06-09 08:33:56
I totally understand your frustration .
Seems a better plan is to forget about the Gmails , hotmails , etc and instead to simply focus on supporting a few email providers like “ slashmail.org ” that wo n’t constantly “ evolve ” and would work you alot less .
I really believe the sort of person who uses FireGPG would rather not be on Gmail anyway , they just do n’t know any better !
Maybe just support what you support and if people are too hard headed to dump Gmail , do n’t worry about them .

CAMPBELL : Head north from San Francisco on Highway 101 and you soon reach the famous vineyards of Mendocino County .
These grapes were once the lifeblood of the community .
Mendocino , like its neighbour the Napa Valley , is still a magnet for connoisseurs .
But we 're not here for the wine .
We 're here for a much more lucrative crop that 's the real source of the country 's wealth .
We 're here for the marijuana .
You wo n't see it from the highway as it's grown discreetly on the back roads .
MATT COHEN : So this is our light deprivation greenhouse .
What you do .... the larger plants that are in here are going to be forced into flowering .
CAMPBELL : Matt Cohen is one of the county 's most successful horticulturists , producing premium organic marijuana .
MATT COHEN : These are pedigree clones of the best cannabis strains in California .
CAMPBELL : We can't show where his farm is .
He 's scared criminals may come and steal his crop , but the police know all about it .
MATT COHEN : [ Northstone Organics ]
This is a very well known cannabis growing area and we now have very detailed regulations on how one can legitimately operate a medical cannabis co-operative .
CAMPBELL : Cohen operates through a large , voter driven loophole in California 's drug laws .
In 1996 a referendum allowed marijuana , also known as cannabis , to be grown and sold for medical reasons .
MATT COHEN : You have to go through some twenty five different hoops you 've got to jump through , in order to do that - criminal background checks and you know you have to be operating a not for profit entity - a complete accountability for every gram of medicine that is produced .
CAMPBELL : His cooperative supplies hundreds of members who have doctors ' recommendations to take it .
Angel Raich is a self - described soccer mum in San Francisco .
She smokes a potent mix of cannabis , head and extract often every two hours .
ANGEL RAICH : I 'd be dead without it .
I have severe chronic pain .
I have arthritis .
I also have a life threatening wasting syndrome .
I do n't get hungry at all .
I .... basically without cannabis I will drop a pound a day .
I 'd literally deteriorate .
My body cannot function , I can't move .
I can't eat .
I can't sleep .
It really is a full physical , medical breakdown .
I do n't get high from cannabis at all .
It 's really boring .
I really honestly do n't like using it .
I do it because I have to .
CAMPBELL : Back in the 60's marijuana was seen as something only freaks and hippies took .
San Francisco's Summer of Love , based in the scenic Haight - Ashbury district terrified America 's leaders and media .
REPORTER : [ Archive footage ]
The movement appears to be growing .
Use of drugs appears to be spreading .
There 's a real danger that more and more young people may follow the call to turn on , tune in , drop out .
Well they 're the hippies .
They make you uncomfortable .
CAMPBELL : A couple of generations on , public attitudes have changed radically .
Haight - Ashbury , along with the rest of the city , now has legal shop front dispensaries for medical marijuana .
Thirteen other states have followed California 's lead .
Even Washington DC allows marijuana for patients and in a few months Californians will ponder the biggest change of all .
They will vote on whether to end nearly a century of prohibition .
Now as prevalent as marijuana is , it 's still illegal in every State to use it for recreation but the November referendum could change that .
It would mean anyone over 21 could have an ounce of cannabis and grow it themselves .
What 's more , it would open the way for it to become a legal cash crop , giving local governments the power to regulate its sale and tax .
Not surprisingly many of today 's younger generation see it as a no - brainer .
STUDENT #1 : Marijuana is the cash crop of California .
STUDENT # 2 : I thought it was corn .
STUDENT #1 : No .
STUDENT # 3 : I thought it was oranges .
STUDENT #1 : No it is marijuana and if you were to legalise it , it would be like three , no something ridiculous like two billion dollars in revenue .
STUDENT # 4 : As long as there are regulations on it I think why , why not ?
If you can regulate it like alcohol it's not any more dangerous .
CAMPBELL : But what do your parents think ?
Is there a bit of a generation gap ?
STUDENT # 4 : Oh my parents would be completely against it .
CAMPBELL : But many parents do agree .
Latest polling suggests a slim majority of Californians plan to vote yes .
Not because they want to smoke it , but because they want to tax it .
TOM AMMIANO : [ Member , California Assembly ]
We have an entity here called the Board of Equalisation and they are kind of our tax body .
So they 've estimated that maybe two to three billion for the State budget .
Now that 's not going to resolve a twenty billion dollar deficit which is what we have , but it could go a long way you know towards many things that people are seeing being pared down .
CAMPBELL : Democrat legislator Tom Ammiano is a long time advocate of marijuana reform .
His ideas have moved from the fringe to the mainstream since the US recession sent California close to bankruptcy .
He says even Republicans are privately admitting they can't afford to keep it illegal .
TOM AMMIANO : [ Member , California Assembly ]
I think the violence that surrounds marijuana now and how sixteen billion bucks a year is the industry , the biggest cash crop in California , I think people are you know become more and more aware of the hypocrisy of pretending that does n't exist and I think the mantra is prohibition is chaos and regulation is control .
CAMPBELL : California is already slashing public spending .
Schools , hospitals , even police departments are being cut to the bone .
Taxing marijuana could be just what the doctor ordered .
ANGEL RAICH :
You know our economy right now in California 's so bad .
You know our kids can't get schoolbooks , they can't get the things that they need .
They 're talking about firing and laying off more teachers left and right and now they 're talking about getting rid of the welfare system .
Anything that we can do in this country at this point to create jobs , is a good thing .
CAMPBELL : But much can change between now and November .
The departing Governor , Arnold Schwarzenegger , is opposing the bill despite his youthful dabbling with the drug .
Many insist marijuana is a problem , not a solution .
DR ROBERT DUPONT : It 's a major cause of substance dependence in the United States .
It 's a leading cause of going into treatment in the United States .
It 's a leading cause of highway fatalities .... rivals alcohol in the United States .
It 's a very serious health problem and especially I would say for youth .
CAMPBELL : Dr Robert Dupont was the White House drug czar in the 1970s .
His work led to a toughening of drug laws in the 1980s .
Dupont believes the move to medical marijuana in the 90's opened a back door to abuse .
DR ROBERT DUPONT : [ White House Drug Chief 1973 - 78 ]
They 're not treating HIV , they 're not treating cancer , they 're not little old ladies , they 're mostly young men and what are they treating ?
Insomnia , backache , depression , anxiety - that 's not a sick population , that 's a drug abusing population .
CAMPBELL : America has been thrashing out the same arguments about prohibition versus regulation for more than forty years .
MATT COHEN : Well you can't beat it ( laughs ) .
You know all these years of prohibition have n't accomplished anything really except a massive amount of crime and a huge illegal trade .
There 's no easy answer , you know there 's no quick fix .
CAMPBELL : Matt Cohen believes the best system would be licensed cafes serving gourmet cannabis to responsible adults .
Forget your backyard dope plant , to ensure consistency and quality for patients he grows products as varied and carefully tended as wine .
MATT COHEN : We only work with pedigree tested clones and it's the same with all the vineyards across the street .
You know it 's the same pinot noir clone .
In here we have some edible storage .
This is all medicated edibles , different varieties .
CAMPBELL : So not everyone smokes the marijuana .
MATT COHEN : No , not at all .
Yeah there 's tinctures , sprays , capsules , lozenges , a wide variety of gourmet baked goods ..... truffles .
CAMPBELL : And the orange down there , what 's that ?
MATT COHEN : Oh they 're the carrots .
CAMPBELL : The only problem he sees is the druggie sounding names by which they 're currently known .
MATT COHEN : So the names of these strains are we have like , LA Confidential , Bubba Kush , KC Jones , Blue Dream , Cannon Dog - I think they 'll be thinking more in the terms of non counter - culture related names because it will be a legitimate industry and probably start coming up with more appropriate names .
CAMPBELL : Starbucks type names .... more gourmet .
MATT COHEN : Call this the Frappucino or something ?
I do n't know .
CAMPBELL : The medical dispensaries in San Francisco are already going down this path .
Many look more like trendy bars than pharmacies .
Once you show your doctor 's recommendations , there 's a bewildering array of legal cannabis .
[ WOMAN BUYING CANNABIS IN SHOP ]
DR ROBERT DUPONT :
The reason people want to do this is the idea of sort of taming marijuana to make it look okay .
That has a bad effect on the public health because it increases the willingness to use the drug and the legitimacy of using the drug and in fact that 's the reason the pro marijuana people are leading with medical marijuana because they exactly want to change that image of the drug .
CAMPBELL : The law allows people to buy marijuana for any condition a doctor believes it could help .
Angel Raich 's doctor Frank Lucido , sees it as something of a wonder drug .
DR FRANK LUCIDO :
It seems to be at the roots of you know a lot of our physiology .
We hear about endorphins and you know the endogenous morphine 's , but we have the endorphin system , but I mean we have the endocannabinoid system so the only , the scientists are only scratching the surface of what the endocannabinoid system can do .
CAMPBELL : Even so many of the people buying marijuana for supposed health reasons , look remarkably healthy .
But Dale Clare insists you should n't judge by appearances .
She 's an activist for the referendum and works for a medical dispensary group .
She 's also a marijuana patient .
DALE CLARE : I suffer vomiting attacks and when I start to throw up I can't stop - and when I say that , I mean full blown dry heaves for twelve , fourteen , sixteen hours .
You know if I walked in or out of any dispensary , I look as about as healthy as they can get .
I am about as healthy as they can get - but every once in a while I 'll go into a cycle that 's almost killed me several times in my life and this is the only thing that I 've found that can prevent me from having to go to the hospital .
DR ROBERT DUPONT :
It 's been a few years since we 've approved medicines on the basis of anecdotes ( laughs ) .
That is a fool 's game .
I understand there are a lot of people who find all kinds of things helpful to them and they can present very compelling testimonies , but this is not science .
CAMPBELL : The controversy over dispensaries is nothing compared to the controversy over growers .
When the 1996 referendum was passed , politicians ran a mile , refusing to set State - wide regulations on how medical marijuana should be grown .
It 's been left to local governments to work out what is and what is n't legal .
Fourteen years on , communities are still arguing about it .
COUNTY SUPERVISOR : [ Addressing meeting ]
And we sent out a letter to every member of Congress and even to the White House .
I think we got one response back from one of them .
It 's still an issue they want to ignore .
CAMPBELL : On a Friday night in Mendocino County dozens of cannabis growers have come to a town hall meeting with the county supervisors .
Many are trying to grow marijuana legally for medical use but they 're not happy with the rules the county has set .
WOMAN : One of the twenty three hoops you have to jump through requires five acres of land and I live on four point two acres .
That means that my collective of ten is reduced to two and a half plants per person .
SHERIFF TOM ALLMAN : I 'm very sorry for your four point two acres Pebbles , is n't a correct size to fall within the law , but ....
CAMPBELL : The man caught in the middle is the elected Sheriff , Tom Allman , a one time warrior in the war on drugs .
SHERIFF TOM ALLMAN : Unfortunately from the start of 1996 of prop 215 , there 's always been a huge grey area in the law .
CAMPBELL : The simple principle of medical marijuana has become a legal minefield for enforcement .
SHERIFF TOM ALLMAN : I started law enforcement where if you had an ounce of marijuana you went to jail .
So now if you have an ounce of marijuana , in Mendocino County if you have an ounce of marijuana my deputies would n't give you a second look .
I mean if somebody told me that there were six plants growing across the street right now , I probably would n't get up out of my chair and walk over there because even if we went over there and even if a person said yes I 'm growing this illegally and I 'm going to sell all of it , it would n't go anywhere in court .
The courts would say , we 're not going to prosecute six plants .
CAMPBELL : Sheriff Allman 's problem is that most people are n't trying to follow the law , they 're trying to bend or break it - from home invaders to international drug syndicates .
Their job is to try to eradicate the big players while regulating the small ones .
A short drive with Deputy CJ Denton shows how prevalent marijuana is .
Young growers have flocked here from all over America , many on the assumption that anything goes ..... and everyone claims they 're only growing it for medicine .
DEPUTY DJ DENTON :
You contact young people , you know they 'll be 18 or 19 and they 'll have a medical card , say they 've got a bad back .
I would say yeah , me too !
( laughs )
Some people they do n't even research the law .
They just say , oh I thought it was legal .
CAMPBELL : But unless you 're a legal expert , it can be hard to know what 's allowed .
Every county has different laws and they 're constantly changing .
Eugene Denson , an ex-hippie turned attorney , travels from county to county defending would be medical growers charged with commercial cultivation .
The 1996 referendum has kept lawyers like him busy .
EUGENE DENSON : The Bill is very short and very simple .
Like all of the major good things of mankind , the golden rule , the Bill of Rights , the 10 Commandments , short and sweet .
What it means is that it leaves a lot open to be filled in , interpretation and those sorts of things .
So very frequently I find clients who are completely compliant with the law who are nevertheless charged with felonies .
CAMPBELL : So what thoughts do you have as the referendum approaches for legalising marijuana overall ?
EUGENE DENSON : I 'll never be out of work .
That 's my thought .
SHERIFF TOM ALLMAN : I 'd love to have some State legislators , some State senators who really and truly have the intestinal fortitude to say this is what 's right and this is what 's wrong cause the laws we have right now say neither .
They say well this is what we , how we feel and this is what should happen .
Well I do n't go to a philosophy job , I enforce the law and I do n't want to enforce philosophy .
CAMPBELL : If the experience of medical marijuana is anything to go by , regulating commercial growing would be a brave leap into the unknown , but this is a pioneering State in a country founded as a great experiment .
In November California will decide whether to take it even further , creating an unalienable right to life , liberty and the pursuit of cannabis .
EUGENE DENSON : You know Allen Ginsberg said to me in the late 1960 's marijuana will be legal in five years .
Well you know he 's died , marijuana 's not legal .
I do n't think I 'd get into the prediction business .
I would say that it is now closer than it 's ever been in my lifetime , but I do n't know what 's going to happen .
This dude is gonna have trouble if he keeps this up .
“ Sure , you can borrow my girlfriend .
Just do n’t put anything in the trunk though .
It ’s a bit dirty … ”

AT&T and Verizon tend to follow each others ' moves pretty closely -- the two carriers regard each other as their nearest competitors , after all -- and we 're hearing that Big Red intends to move to some sort of tiered bucket strategy on July 29 .
We do n't have details on whether the pricing will be identical to AT&T's ( $ 25 for 2GB , $ 15 for 200 MB ) , but we imagine it 'll be within shouting distance if not .

All day yesterday on Fox , the talking / shrieking heads were all worked up about some comments from Rep. Linda Sanchez about Arizona 's SB1070 :
A California congresswoman is pointing the finger at white supremacist groups , who she says have inspired Arizona 's new law cracking down on illegal immigrants .
Rep. Linda Sanchez , D - Calif. , told a Democratic Club on Tuesday that white supremacist groups are influencing lawmakers to adopt laws that will lead to discrimination .
" There 's a concerted effort behind promoting these kinds of laws on a state - by - state basis by people who have ties to white supremacy groups , " said the lawmaker , who is of Mexican descent .
" It 's been documented .
It 's not mainstream politics . "
Oh my God !
Somebody tossed a little Baby Ruth of Truth into the swimming pool !
Rick Folbaum told Jon Scott that Sanchez got her information from those notorious dispensers of inconvenient information , a left - wing blogger .
( Hey , it coulda been C&L. ) Megyn Kelly demanded of Clarissa Martinez of the National Council of La Raza that she denounce these horrendous words .
And Sean Hannity did n't even bother to query into whether what Sanchez said might be accurate -- he just ran a quick segment sneering at her " Liberal Lie " .
The problem they have is that it 's in fact perfectly accurate .
Sanchez may have gotten the information from a blogger , but it 's more than likely the blog got its information from the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Anti-Defamation League -- both of which have , as Sanchez suggested , fully documented that a number of the leading " respectable " anti-immigration organizations are in fact fronts created by white - supremacist ideologues .
You see , Fox and everyone else has been running commentary from Kris Kobach , a well - paid lackey for the Federation for American Immigration Reform .
Kobach has been boasting on Fox and elsewhere that he and his fellows at FAIR are helping to push the Arizona immigration law in other states as well .
Well , FAIR is exactly what Linda Sanchez described .
And it 's not exactly news , either .
Here 's the SPLC 's rundown on the three main groups involved in promoting the Arizona law :
FAIR , which Tanton founded and where he remains on the board , has been listed as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center .
Among the reasons are its acceptance of $ 1.2 million from the Pioneer Fund , a group founded to promote the genes of white colonials that funds studies of race , intelligence and genetics .
FAIR has also hired as key officials men who also joined white supremacist groups .
It has board members who regularly write for hate publications .
It promotes racist conspiracy theories about Latinos .
And it has produced television programming featuring white nationalists .
CIS was conceived by Tanton and began life as a program of FAIR .
CIS presents itself as a scholarly think tank that produces serious immigration studies meant to serve " the broad national interest . "
But the reality is that CIS has never found any aspect of immigration that it liked , and it has frequently manipulated data to achieve the results it seeks .
Its executive director last fall posted an item on the conservative National Review Online website about Washington Mutual , a bank that had earlier issued a press release about its inclusion on a list of " Business Diversity Elites " compiled by Hispanic Business magazine .
Over a copy of the bank 's press release , the CIS leader posted a headline — " Cause and Effect ? " — that suggested a link between the bank 's opening its ranks to Latinos and its subsequent collapse .
Like CIS , NumbersUSA bills itself as an organization that operates on its own and rejects racism completely .
In fact , NumbersUSA was for the first five years of its existence a program of U.S. Inc. , a foundation run by Tanton to fund numerous nativist groups , and its leader was an employee of that foundation for a decade .
He helped edit Tanton 's racist journal , The Social Contract , and was personally introduced by Tanton to a leader of the Pioneer Fund .
He also edited a book by Tanton and another Tanton employee that was banned by the Canadian border officials as hate literature , and on one occasion spoke to the Council of Conservative Citizens , a hate group which has called blacks " a retrograde species of humanity . "
Together , FAIR , CIS and NumbersUSA form the core of the nativist lobby in America .
In 2007 , they were key players in derailing bipartisan , comprehensive immigration reform that had been expected by many observers to pass .
Today , these organizations are frequently treated as if they were legitimate , mainstream commentators on immigration .
But the truth is that they were all conceived and birthed by a man who sees America under threat by non-white immigrants .
And they have never strayed far from their roots .
The SPLC has further details about John Tanton and about FAIR , notably the accumulated record that induced the SPLC to designate it a hate group :
Founded by Tanton in 1979 , FAIR has long been marked by anti-Latino and anti-Catholic attitudes .
It has mixed this bigotry with a fondness for eugenics , the idea of breeding better humans discredited by its Nazi associations .
It has accepted $ 1.2 million from an infamous , racist eugenics foundation .
It has employed officials in key positions who are also members of white supremacist groups .
Recently , it has promoted racist conspiracy theories about Mexico 's secret designs on the American Southwest and an alternative theory alleging secret plans to merge the United States , Mexico and Canada .
Just last February , a senior FAIR official sought " advice " from the leaders of a racist Belgian political party .
It 's not just the SPLC that has reached this conclusion .
The Anti-Defamation League 's assessment falls along similar lines .
Finally , it 's worth remembering that the two people most associated with SB1070 in Arizona -- its coauthor , State Sen .
Russell Pearce , and the law - enforcement officer whose immigration obsession inspired the law , Maricopa County 's Sheriff Joe Arpaio -- themselves in fact have documented associations with Arizona neo -Nazis .
Fox may think they can whip this up , bloody shirt style , in favor of the Arizona law 's advocates .
I 'd wager those same people are wishing they 'd just let it quietly drop .
Because Linda Sanchez told the truth , and they all know it .

If you want to tell the difference between geeks and nerds , take a look at some of their interests .
A geek is usually extremely knowledgeable about a certain topic .
For example , there are wine geeks , train geeks , and car geeks .
While their fascination makes them unique , geeks are generally social and want to share their interests with others .
Alternatively , a nerd is someone who might be extremely smart about a lot of topics but they are n't very interested in being social .
When comparing the two , a geek may enjoy playing board games with others or watching films with friends while a nerd might like computer games or chess , which are quieter and more solo pursuits .
In the end , however , nerds and geeks all have something to contribute and often do n’t fit many of the stereotypes about them .
To learn how to tell a nerd from a geek by what jobs they have , keep reading !
flashing simultaneously like synchronized Christmas lights .
Scenes like this really happen every summer in the Great Smoky Mountains , home to the firefly species .
Individual males fly around flashing a species - specific pattern , trying to draw response flashes from females .
But what makesunique is that they flash in unison with their peers , rhythmically lighting up the entire fields .
For years , scientists have been left to guess as to the specific reason the bugs synchronize their illumination .
But now , thanks to research described in the journal Science , researchers have shown that female P. carolinus respond at a much higher rate to synchronized flash patterns compared to those that are asynchronous , indicating that the synchrony plays an important role in helping females locate their potential mate .
Study authors Andrew Moiseff , a professor of physiology and neurobiology at the University of Connecticut , and Jonathan Copeland , a professor of biology at Georgia Southern University , have been studying synchrony in male P. carolinus since the early 1990s .
But this is the first time they 've designed an experiment that directly probes the effect 's underlying behavioral purpose .
" We 've looked at it , and we 've described it — all of those sorts of things , " Moiseff says , " but we really wanted to understand more about whether or not it served a function . "
Several theories suggest that synchrony evolved to facilitate male - female interaction .
But none of these have been thoroughly tested , Moiseff says , so he and Copeland tested the responses of six females in a " virtual environment " containing eight light - emitting diodes ( LEDs ) that simulated the flash patterns of eight separate males .
The researchers used a computer program to vary the degree of synchrony between the LED flashes and measured the responses of individual females to four different stimuli ranging from unison synchrony to completely asynchronous .
They found that , on average , females responded to 82 percent of the stimuli that resembled males lighting up in unison , and responded to a similarly high percentage of a " near - unison " pattern .
By contrast , they responded very little to completely asynchronous flashes .
While the result indicates that males flash in unison to influence female behavior , just how females process this information was still unclear .
The researchers tackled this question by observing females ' response when seven of the eight diodes were hidden .
When a female detected and focused on the P. carolinus flash pattern from a single virtual male , she would respond accordingly with a flash of her own .
But when all eight — including the one to which she had previously responded — were flashing asynchronously , her responses decreased .
" That suggested that for some reason she was not attending to a single diode .
She was somehow looking at all of the diodes ( at the same time ) , and attending to a much greater visual field , " Moiseff says .
This makes sense , according to the researchers , if one considers that the male firefly will be flying as he flashes — potentially covering a large space .
" If a female processed only flashes from a restricted spacial area , " it says in the paper , " she might miss some of the male 's flashes as he changed location , " and fail to recognize his species - specific pattern .
Still , while this strategy would seem to help a female locate a single flying male , it would also seem to be a hindrance when multiple males are flashing in her field of vision .
Moiseff and Copeland propose that synchrony " may be the behavioral solution to this problem , " since it would maintain the clarity of the specific pattern the female recognizes .

Pakistan ’s dueling drones debate
While Pakistan ’s security forces battle al Qaeda - inspired Pakistani Taliban militants in the volatile tribal regions of Bajaur and Orakzai , CIA - operated drones continue chasing foreign al - Qaeda operatives hiding in the wild Waziristan region .
The latest such strike on a hide - out in South Waziristan tribal area near the Afghan border took out eight militants earlier this week , including an Egyptian allied with al - Qaeda , Hamza al - Jufi .
Believed to be operating out of Forward Operating Base Chapman , located across the border in Khost , Afghanistan , drones have struck targets inside Pakistan at least 141 times since 2004 , including 45 attacks already this year so far .
Regardless of how effective drones may be against al - Qaeda and its affiliates , their use is the subject of widespread debate , due in large part to questions about the legality of the drones .
Condemnation of such attacks and their characterization as a violation of the " sovereignty , solidarity , integrity and defense of Pakistan , " in the words of Pakistani parliamentarian Imran Khan , is primarily rooted in the context of the global war against terrorism that began in October 2001 under President George Bush .
This association with Bush has in part led many conservative Pakistanis and right - wing political groups such as the Jamaat - i- Islami and Jamiat Ulema - i- Islam to openly oppose the drone strikes .
Even the Tehrik - i- Taliban Pakistan ( TTP ) , the Waziristan - based group that is spearheading the insurgency in the northwestern regions , has justified attacks as a reaction to the drone strikes .
Others object not to the drones , but to Pakistani public opinion on their use .
For instance , Ayaz Ameer , an analyst - turned - politician , and an MP from the opposition Pakistan Muslim League - N , said at a recent conference hosted by my Islamabad think tank that Pakistani officials take two contradictory positions on drone strikes : publicly condemning them while endorsing them privately .
Chriss Rogers , research fellow at Campaign for Innocent Victims in Conflict ( CIVIC ) , said at the forum , " Since Pakistan formally never raised the issue at any international forum nor did it formally and officially issue statement against it , there seemed to be a tacit understanding between the United States and Pakistan over it . "
But covert Pakistani consent does not necessarily make the strikes legal .
According to Ahmar Bilal Soofi , an expert in international law , " The United States is applying drones in the name of self - defense and the war on al - Qaeda , but even this is a violation of international law and Pakistani sovereignty . "
Furthermore , he argues , " These means become even more objectionable because the CIA is operating drone strikes , thereby compromising issues such as transparency and accountability . "
Some observers have also suggested that a Pakistani operation of the drones could significantly blunt criticism of the strikes .
Indeed Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari and army leaders have frequently asked that the technology be transferred to Pakistan , and has said that such a transfer would blunt criticism of the strikes ..
Increasingly , Pakistani critics have also relied on arguments made by Philip Alston , a New York University law professor and the U.N. special representative on extrajudicial executions , who in a June report recommended that the U.S. military handle drone strikes against the Taliban and al - Qaeda - related militants in Pakistan , and also wrote that , " [ i ] f a State commits a targeted killing in the territory of another State , the second State
should publicly indicate whether it gave consent , and on what basis . "
Set against the backdrop of the recent command change in Afghanistan , U.S. policy on the drone attacks may perhaps also undergo some qualitative changes .
Particularly in view of Obama ’s search for rapid success in Afghanistan , for which Pakistan ’s support is crucial , the Obama administration may work out a mechanism that , while eliminating al - Qaeda members , also addresses Pakistani concerns on the legality of drone strikes .
This change could also erase quite a bit of mistrust of the U.S. in Pakistan and help improve bilateral cooperation .
But Pakistan ’s government must first end its dueling public and private positions on drones and state clearly where it stands on this simmering issue .

1 July 2010 | Europe is looking to be the biggest new thing in biodiversity offsetting .
First , a little scene - setting … most of the TEEB report researchers / writers are based out of Europe , so there ’s been general hubbub about the value of ecosystems and biodiversity building during this year .
Add to that two recent feasibility studies on biodiversity offsetting – one conducted for the European Commission and one conducted for the UK’s Department for Environment , Food and Rural Affairs ( DEFRA ) .
The momentum builds as UK politics steer towards offsetting and an entrepreneur opens the UK ’s first bank selling ‘ conservation credits . ’
With all this buzz building , Peter Carter of the European Investment Bank drops this bombshell quote at a recent European ‘ Green Week ’ Conference : biodiversity offsetting could be “ as big as the carbon market , ” and he pointed to the US wetland mitigation market as an example .
Reality check : the total carbon market worldwide is upwards of $ 100 billion annually vs. total US wetland mitigation market is around $ 1 - 2 billion annually .
Others in the know pop the optimism with a dose of reality :
“ With the carbon market we know what we are trading and how to tackle them .
We can set a cap and use the price to drive them down .
We have a baseline for biodiversity in Europe now , but it is not one figure – it is four pages of different elements of biodiversity , ” says Karl Falkenberg , European Commission director general for environment .
( Ecologist.com )
Some of the more realistic optimism for biodiversity offsets in Europe recognizes that development will continue to occur , and offsets could be a useful policy tool provided that there is additionality .
But Pavan Sukdev , the PI on the TEEB study , counters “ societies needed to cease putting “ private wealth above public wealth ” to tackle the problem effectively .
” ( NYT )
In related news , the EU Habitats and Birds Directive had a task force working on biodiversity offsets that has recently released a position paper .
The position of the BHDTF ( Birds and Habitats Directive Task Force ) is one of cautious approval for biodiversity offsets for habitats and species of European Importance outside Natura 2000 sites .
The task force emphasizes that the “ current stringent offset system prescribed in … the Habitats Directive must be maintained and its implementation strengthened . ”
As well , the position paper lays out principles that an offset system should include , referencing Ecosystem Marketplace ’s sister initiative , the Business and Biodiversity Offset Programme ( BBOP ) .

BitTorrent is the ideal way to transfer large files to thousands of locations in a short period of time .
This does n't only apply to movies and music that are downloaded by the average BitTorrent user , companies can benefit from it as well .
With help from BitTorrent , Facebook can now push hundreds of megabytes of new code to all servers worldwide in just a minute .
According to Tom Cook of Facebook ’s systems engineering group , the daily code updates for Facebook used to cause a lot of trouble until they discovered BitTorrent .
Cook gave a talk at the Velocity Conference this week titled ‘ A Day in the Life of Facebook Operations ’ where he explained how effective BitTorrent is for server deployment .
“ BitTorrent is fantastic for this , it ’s really great , ” Cook said .
“ It ’s ‘ superduper ’ fast and it allows us to alleviate a lot of scaling concerns we ’ve had in the past , where it took forever to get code to the webservers before you could even boot it up and run it . ”
With their BitTorrent - powered distribution system Facebook is now able to send a few hundred MB to tens of thousands of machines in just one minute .
The internal Facebook swarm turns every server into a peer that helps in distributing the new code , which gets it updated as quickly as possible .
Without BitTorrent this process could take several hours to complete .
Facebook is not the only large web - service that uses BitTorrent to keep its servers updated .
Earlier this year we reported that Twitter is doing the same .
Twitter ’s implementation , codenamed ‘ Murder ’ , is based on the BitTornado BitTorrent client .
The code is open to the public and licensed under the free software Apache License .
Besides these social networking sites , several universities have been successfully using BitTorrent - powered systems to update their computers for quite some time already .
A Dutch university reported that it retired 20 of the 22 servers it used to send out updates to workstations , saving not only time but also money .
It ’s beginning to look like BitTorrent may become the standard for large scale networks that want to update their machines quickly and efficiently .
With huge brands such as Facebook and Twitter adopting it , we can only expect that others will follow their lead .
Right now digital films are still shipped out on physical harddisk , which is an awfully slow and expensive process .
Perhaps movie theaters should look into BitTorrent as well .
That way the movie industry could actually benefit from BitTorrent , instead of complaining about it .
The Debt Supercycle Path to Profligacy and End Game
I have been writing about The End Game for some time now .
And writing a book of the same title .
Consequently , I have been thinking a lot about how the credit crisis evolved into the sovereign debt crisis , and how it all ends .
Today we explore a few musings I have had of late , while we look at some very interesting research .
What will a world look like as a variety of nations have to deal with the end of their Debt Supercycle .
We 'll jump right in with no " but first 's " this week .
Part of this week 's writing is colored by my next conference .
Next week I go to Vancouver to speak at the Agora Investment Symposium .
I have a number of very good friends who will be there , both speaking and attending .
This is generally a " hard money , " gold - bug - type crowd ( and a very large conference ) .
Some ( but not all ) of the speakers believe that all fiat currencies , including the US dollar , will default in one way or another , either outright or through inflation , as mounting debts and out - of - control entitlement obligations force large - scale monetization , leading to high inflation if not hyperinflation .
There are a couple of panels and debates that I presume I will be involved in , and I have been meditating on how the panels will go .
Bill Bonner , founder of Agora and a book - writing machine , has a steel - trap mind with an ability to turn a phrase that is way beyond that of your humble analyst .
The preponderance of the panel members will likely be in the soft - depression camp , and most of us will card - carrying members of the Often Wrong but Seldom in Doubt school of economics and investing ( the Latin for which , I am told , is " Saepe mendosus , nunquam dubius . " )
And yet , I am not quite there with most of that thinking , so the debates will be lively .
Understand , I started in the newsletter business back in 1981 or so , working with Dr. Gary North ( also known as " Scary Gary " ) .
Gary is an Austrian , and although I took a lot of economics courses at Rice , I had never read anything even remotely close to the Austrian school .
I caught up rather quickly , and in the mid-1980s even wrote my own gold - stock newsletter ( although I must admit I know next to nothing of the current gold - stock world ) .
I was mostly limited to books , newsletters , and journals for reading material .
Then came the mid '90s and the internet , and the world opened up .
I became incurably addicted to information and read widely and deeply .
At some point the small lens of Austrian thought became difficult to continue to peer through , as I looked for perspectives on the larger world .
I now worship at a number of economic altars , in the ongoing effort to understand what is happening in the real world , not just in the world of theory or the world of what we would like to be .
So , with that background , let 's look at The End Game .
The Debt Supercycle
When I mention The End Game , you 'll immediately want to know what is ending .
What I think is ending for a significant number of countries in the " developed " world is the Debt Supercycle .
The concept of the Debt Supercycle was originally developed by the Bank Credit Analyst .
It was Hamilton Bolton , the BCA founder , who used the word supercycle , and he was referring generally to a lot of things , including money velocity , bank liquidity , and interest rates .
Tony Boeckh changed the concept to the more simple " Debt Supercycle " back in the early 1970s , as he believed the problem was spiraling private - sector debt .
The current editor of the BCA ( and Maine fishing buddy ) Martin Barnes has greatly expanded on the concept .
Essentially , the Debt Supercycle is the decades - long growth of debt from small and easily - dealt - with levels , to a point where bond markets rebel and the debt has to be restructured or reduced or a program of austerity must be undertaken to bring the debt back to manageable proportions .
As Bank Credit Analyst wrote back in 2007 :
" The history of the U.S. is characterized by a long - run increase in indebtedness , punctuated by occasional financial crises and subsequent policy reflation .
The subprime blow - up is the latest installment in this ongoing Debt Supercycle story .
During each crisis , there are always fears that conventional reflation will no longer work , implying the economy and markets face a catastrophic debt unwinding .
Such fears have always proved unfounded , and the current episode is no exception .
" A combination of Fed rate cuts , fiscal easing ( aimed at relieving subprime distress ) , and a lower dollar will eventually trigger another upleg in the Debt Supercycle , and a new round of leverage and financial excesses .
The objects of speculation are likely to be global , particularly emerging markets and resource related assets .
The Supercycle will end if foreign investors ever turn their back on U.S. assets , triggering capital flight out of the dollar and robbing U.S. authorities of any room for maneuver .
This will not happen any time soon . "
I was talking with Martin a few months ago , and about the topic turned to the ending of the Debt Supercycle .
Martin said we are nowhere near the end , as the government is stepping in where private debtors are cutting back .
We have just shifted the focus of where the debt is coming from .
And he is right , in that the Debt Supercycle in the US , Great Britain , Japan and other developed countries ( yes , even Greece ! ) is still very much in play as governments explode their balance sheets .
Total debt continues to grow .
Somewhere Over the Rainbow
And yet , and yet ...
While the Debt Supercycle may not yet have ended , I think we can begin to see a clear case that , like the sandwich - board - wearing cartoon prophet warning , " The End is Nigh ! "
Greece is the harbinger of fundamental change .
Spain and Portugal are pointing to the same outcome , as their cost of debt keeps rising .
And Ireland ?
The Baltics ?
There is a limit to how much debt you can pile on .
But as the work of Reinhart and Rogoff points out ( This Time Is Different ) , there is not a fixed limit or some certain percentage of GNP .
Rather , the limit is all about confidence , a theme I have written on many times .
Everything goes along well , and then " Boom ! " it does n't .
That " Boom " has happened to Greece .
Without massive assistance , Greek debt would be unmarketable .
Default would be inevitable .
( I still think it is ! )
The limit is different for every nation .
For Russia in the 1990s , it was a rather minor total debt - to - GDP ratio of around 12 % .
Japan will soon have a debt - to - GDP ratio of 230 % !
The difference ?
Local savers bought government debt in Japan and did not in Russia .
The end of the Debt Supercycle does not have to mean calamity for each country , depending on how far down the road they are .
Yes , if you are Greece your choices are between very , very bad and disastrous .
Japan is a bug in search of a windshield .
Each country has its own dynamics .
Take the US .
We are some ways off from the end .
We have time to adjust .
But let 's be under no illusions , we can not run deficits of 10 % of GDP forever .
At some point the Fed will either have to monetize the debt or the bond market will simply demand an ever - higher interest rate .
Why ca n't we go the way of Japan ?
Because we do not have the level of savings they have traditionally had .
But their savings levels are rapidly declining , which says that if they want to continue their deficit spending at 10 % of GDP , they will have to go into the foreign markets to borrow money at a much higher cost , or their central bank will have to print money .
Neither choice is good .
The Path to Profligacy
How did we get here ?
We simply kept borrowing ever greater amounts of money at an increasingly rapid pace .
Look at the chart below .
It is about six months old , but not much has changed .
In the beginning , each dollar of debt brought about a corresponding dollar of increase in GDP .
But that early money was invested in houses and in the means of production , which helped grow the economy .
As time went on , and especially after the ' 80s , more and more of the debt was used for consumption ( of which much has come to be from foreign sources ) and not for the increase of productive capacity .
Toward the end , it took $ 3 of debt to create a $ 1 rise in GDP in the US .
And now , each $ 1 rise in debt is government debt , which some research ( not neo- Keynesian Paul Krugman's ! ) says has a slightly negative multiplier - it actually hurts GDP .
And it is not just the US .
Take a look at the chart of G - 7 debt ( courtesy of GMO , more about which later ) .
That is one ugly and unsustainable chart .
In 1950 the G7 countries were recovering from very large war - time debts .
Now we do n't have that excuse .
Nor do we have the option of doing what they did .
They cut military spending , inflated a little in nominal terms , and grew their way out of the problem .
Things That Cannot Be
Talk about unsustainable .
The next chart is one of something that cannot be .
The US cannot borrow $ 15 trillion in the next ten years .
It 's just not there .
Long before that , the bond market will simply rebel , rates will rise , and the aftermath will make the last crisis seem like a cakewalk .
For most countries with debt problems , The End Game is a binary - path - dependent future .
Countries can elect to get their fiscal houses in order over time , getting the fiscal deficits below the growth of nominal GDP .
That is not without consequence , as it will mean slower growth in the short term ( less than one year ) , but cutting deficits year after year , even gradually , will mean a very slow - growth , Muddle Through economy for a sustained period .
Some say the coming election is the most important we have had for a long time .
I disagree .
It is one thing for the Tea Party movement and independents to elect a Republican Congress .
If I am right and the economy is still slow and unemployment lingers around 8 % by 2012 , it is likely we will see a Republican president at that point .
So some will say 2012 will be the important election .
However , I think the really important election will be in 2014 .
Let 's make the ( clearly ) optimistic assumption that Republicans get religion and really go to work on the deficits .
The economy will not be booming in 2014 , as a result of the tightening and move to austerity , whether through cuts or tax increases or both .
Cutting more than $ 1 trillion annually out of spending over 7 - 8 years is not easy or without pain .
Will voters in 2014 decide there is too much pain ?
Will they stay the course for fiscal control or will they scream for more stimulus ?
Will they take the long view and let politicians make hard choices or will they send the message that short - term choices are what they want ?
Will they give lip service to going on a diet and exercising and then stay on the couch and eat chips and watch TV ?
Or will they really get fiscal religion and get with the program ?
It 's all well and good to say that you want fiscal rectitude .
It 's another thing when it is hitting budgets near and dear to you .
And to get back to a remotely sustainable deficit is going to take pain in every corner .
It is going to hit near you , gentle reader .
Some will get hit harder than others .
And this is the case in every country running large and out - of - control deficits .
It is not just a US problem .
The Irish are in what can only be called a depression , along with the Baltic states and Hungary .
Greece will soon be there , once they have to meet market rates for their debt , or force their labor markets to endure a very serious deflation to make themselves more competitive .
So , can we know how The End Game will turn out ?
The short answer is no .
Each country will have to make its own political choices .
Could we see hyperinflation in the US on Britain or Japan ?
It is possible , with bad policy decisions .
I doubt it that it gets to that .
But could we see inflation ?
The answer is yes .
That has been the traditional method of default for many countries over the years .
Instead of outright default , they simply inflate away debt .
And the logic is compelling .
If you have 5 % inflation along with 3 % real growth , you get a nominal growth rate of 8 % .
That means in nine years the economy is twice the size in dollar terms , but only about 35 % bigger in inflation - adjusted terms .
If somewhere along the way you can get your deficits down to " just " 3 % , then you can reduce your debt - to - GDP ratio by 5 % a year .
In less than ten years , you cut your debt - to - GDP ratio in half .
Sounds good , right ?
Of course , you have destroyed the purchasing power of your currency , given a real hit to the incomes of the middle class , defrauded those who bought your debt , and in all likelihood you did not hold inflation to just 5 % .
Think the '70s .
And getting the deficit down to 3 % is no easy proposition for many countries .
Look at the chart below , again from GMO in a paper by Edward Chancellor on sovereign debt .
I highly commend it to you .
It is all over the net , but the easiest place I found to read it is at http://www.zerohedge.com/article/must-read-reflections-gmos-edward-chancellor.
We can think of fiscal debt in two ways , structural and cyclical .
Structural debt is that caused by government spending programs .
Cyclical debt occurs during recessions as revenue drops .
One assumes that at some point things get back to normal and revenues begin to rise and the cyclical part of the deficit goes away .
But that still leaves the structural debt .
That can only be dealt with by cutting spending , raising taxes , or holding spending flat while growing your way out of the problem - or some combination of all three .
I find it interesting that Italy has a far less problematic fiscal situation than many of its neighbors .
And while politicians in the US always say they will cut out wasteful spending , there just is n't all that much here , percentage - wise .
Italy has a lot of places to cut .
As an example , there are 629,000 official cars , some of them high - priced Maseratis , that ferry government officials around .
That is ten times more than in other European countries and , on a percentage - of - GDP basis , 50 times more than in the US .
They could cut out half of them and save about $ 15 billion , by my back - of - the - napkin calculation , which is more than 0.6 % of total GDP .
Reduce the number to the European average and you could cut half the structural debt .
( I assume about $ 50,000 per year for maintenance , depreciation , and drivers . )
Oh , that we in the US had such easy pickings .
( http://www.economist.com/node/16102798?story_id=16102798)
The Province of Uncertainty
Edward Chancellor closes his paper so eloquently .
Let me quote :
" As a result of the financial crisis , the world 's leading sovereign credit markets have left the world of risk , where probabilities of gains and losses can be measured , and entered the darker province of uncertainty .
The future performance of sovereign credits depends on future events and decisions that are unknowable .
" Will the global economic recovery be sustained ?
Or will economic growth and tax revenues remain weak for a prolonged period ?
Will policymakers in leading countries find the political strength to restore their government finances to order ?
Or will , as some fear , the attempt to cut deficits actually increase them ( by hurting the economy and reducing tax revenues ) ?
" Will central banks engage in further bouts of quantitative easing until they reach the point of no return ?
Or will they err on the side of caution and tighten too early ?
Will the current deflationary policies within the Eurozone persist ?
Or will the ECB turn toward the monetization of excessive debt levels ?
Will interest rates on long - term government debt remain low ?
Or will bond vigilantes take fright and demand higher rates as compensation for all this uncertainty and risk ?
" These are interesting but intractable questions .
Nobody knows their answers .
Current yields on government bonds in most advanced economies ( PIGS excepted ) are at very low levels .
Under only one condition - that the world follows Japan 's experience of prolonged deflation - do they offer any chance of a reasonable return .
But this is not the only possible future .
For other outcomes , long - dated government bonds offer a limited upside with a potentially uncapped downside .
As investors , such asymmetric pay - off profiles do n't appeal to us .
Caveat ( sovereign ) creditor ! "
As noted above , The End Game is path - dependent for each country .
By that I mean that the end result will stem directly from the course they choose .
It is not clear what those choices will be .
For instance , I have often noted that the euro is not a currency so much as an experiment .
But it is also not an economic currency , but rather a political currency .
Whether the euro lasts in its present form is a political decision to be made by numerous national actors .
It is too soon to tell .
All of the developed countries that are in trouble have hard decisions to make .
To pretend that we know exactly what that involves requires a fair degree of hubris .
But we can see the various paths .
In most cases , the number of paths is quite limited , because bad choices were made that have brought us to our current set of choices .
As we attempt to sort out those paths , we will find there are signposts along the way telling us which path we are taking .
As investors , we can then position ourselves accordingly .
And even for countries that , relatively speaking , have kept their act together , we are talking about a large part of world GDP at risk .
It is an interesting world in which we live .
Vancouver , Maine , and Europe
As noted above , next week I am in Vancouver .
I will be doing a seminar for my Canadian partner John Nicola on Tuesday evening .
Drop me a note if you want an invite , assuming there is room .
Then on to the conference , where there are so many friends and compatriots - I am really looking forward to it .
Back home for two weeks and then off to New York for a day for some media , then to Maine for the annual fishing trip with David Kotok and friends .
Looks like CNBC will not cover it this year after all .
I will be going to Europe in the middle of September .
For sure London , Amsterdam , and Malta .
Maybe a few other cities .
I will spend a weekend at the vacation home of European partner Niels Jensen in Mallorca ( along with South American partner Enrique Fynne ) .
More on that as the schedule settles .
Thinking of Europe has me once again thumbing through my latest copy of International Living .
I often wonder ( fantasize ? ) about the places they describe and wonder what it would be like to have a less hectic life .
Maybe someday , but for now I take it in bits and pieces as I travel .
You can get your own inexpensive copy of International Living and find out about what locales are inviting or just dream along with me .
This weekend is going to be a busy working weekend .
My co-author for the book , Jonathan Tepper of Variant Perception , is in from London ; and we will spend the next three days editing , writing , critiquing , and thinking about the book .
The goal is to have a rough first draft by the end of July and then final edits by the end of August , and then get it to the publisher and out the door as soon as possible after that .
Frankly , writing a book is a lot harder than writing this e-letter .
I know it is mostly mental , but a book seems so much more , well , serious .
It takes 3 - 4 times as long to write the same amount of copy .
But I think this book is going to be well worth the time .
It is time to hit the send button .
It is late and I have to get up ( relatively ) early .
Jonathon is young ( at least to me ! ) and seems to need no sleep , so I have to try and keep up with him .
We 'll see how that goes .
Have a great week !
Even if we are thinking about The End Game , that does n't mean we can't have fun in the summer !

27 Jul 10 , 15:37 Deficit - Debt/ GDP
I agree about the ' End Game ' a factor which is part of it is :
Why is a countries Deficit and Debt related to GDP ?
I know it is in the Maastricht Treaty , and now appears to be a global criteria , but WHY ?
As you point out : GDP is made up of four things : Consumption , Investment , Government Spending and Net Exports .
None of those relate to government income , a more logical formula is expenditure as a percentage of income .
The 2009 - 10 figure was 120 % .
The Deficit - Debit to GDP is encouragement to borrow on the basis of it being below the limits of 3 % and 60 % ...... until the GDP dropped As Warren Buffet said about the banks and heavily leveraged investors ' We will know who is swimming naked when the tide goes out ' .
The tide went out and exposed the naked countries : Total debt Total debt 2009 deficit ( % GDP ) ( € m ) ( % GDP ) Italy 115.8 1,760,765 5.3 Greece 115.1 273,407 13.6 Belgium 96.7 326,606 6.0 France 77.6 1,489,025 7.5 Portugal 76.8 125,910 9.4 Germany 73.2 1,762,211 3.3 Malta 69.1 3,948 3.8 UK
68.1 1,067,819 11.5 Austria 66.5 184,105 3.4 Ireland 64 104,667 14.3 Netherlands 60.9 347,021 5.3 Cyprus 56.2 9,527 6.1 Spain 53.2 559,650 11.2 Finland 44 75,217 2.2 Slovenia 35.9 12,519 5.5 Slovakia 35.7 22,585 6.8 Luxembourg 14.5 5,464 0.7
Government cuts will increase Deficit - Debt to GDP , the potential consequence is higher interest on the debt , its a vicious circle created by an inappropriate criteria .
Do you know why it was introduced ?
Regards Bernard
As Blue Texan at FDL noted , Al Franken laid waste to the GOP 's anti-Thurgood Marshall Campaign and as they called it , their minority outreach program .
Franken gives his " good friend " Lindsey Graham and the Republicans a little history lesson on what an " activist judge " is and why Justice Thurgood Marshall was n't one of them .
Franken :
You said there are three things that judges hold to when they ’re not activists .
You said that they respect precedent .
They make narrow decisions and they defer to the political branches , in other words the legislature .
And there are a lot of recent cases that we ’ve been talking about that instinctively strike me and a lot of other people as falling outside of these three guidelines .
And I think that in these cases the Supreme Court was legislating from the bench , which is being activist .
Franken goes on to discuss why the decisions in Circuit City v. Adams , Gross v. FBL Financial Services , Rent - a - Center v. Jackson , Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission , Leegin Creative Leather Products , Inc. v. PSKS Inc. , the Supreme Court would have fit into Kagan ’s guidelines of what would define an “ activist court ” and noted that Republicans all “ seem to like ” those decisions .
He went on to explain why there is no way that Brown v. Board of Education should be lumped in with those other cases and how it was “ an exemplar of overturning a precedent that needed to be overturned . ”
Franken :
There are certain situations where the Supreme Court really should subject the law to a heightened scrutiny and this is what I think Justice Marshall was talking about when he said that the court should show “ special solicitude for the despised and disadvantaged , the people who went unprotected by every other organ of government and who had no other champion . ”
Now in the opening statements you were criticized for admiring Justice Marshall for believing this , but I actually think that this belief , Justice Marshall ’s belief is just good , Constitutional law .
Are you familiar with Carolene Products … Carolene Products case of 1938 ?
Kagan :
Yes sir .
Franken :
Are you familiar with Footnote Four of that decision ?
Kagan :
Yes sir .
Franken :
And you ’re familiar with that because the footnote ’s really important , is n’t it ?
It ’s often taught in Constitutional law classes , whether they be in the first year or the second year or the third year , right ?
Kagan :
It is .
Franken :
Can you tell me what that footnote says and why it ’s important ?
Kagan : Senator it seems as though you have it in front of you and you ’re going to do a better job of it than I am at this moment .
Franken :
You ’re a mind reader .
Footnote Four basically says that when courts interpret the Constitution and try to figure out whether a law complies with the Constitution , courts should give special scrutiny to laws that violate a specific part of the Constitution , that restrict the political process and that affect “ religious , national , racial and discrete and insular minorities ” who have a really hard time getting help through the normal political process .
Now to me discrete and insular minorities sounds a lot like the despised and disadvantaged that go unprotected and have no other champion .
Is it safe to say that Justice Marshall ’s belief is consistent with Carolene Products ?
Kagan :
Well there ’s no doubt Sen .
Franken that racial classifications are subject to very high scrutiny under the Equal Protection clause and have been so for a long time and the Equal Protection clause exists to ensure against discrimination on disfavored basis very much including in the archetypal example is race and that it is not only appropriate but obligatory on the courts to enforce that prohibition on discrimination on the basis of race .
Franken :
So Justice Marshall ’s belief that was criticized in the opening statements is really very consistent with established Constitutional law , is n’t it ?
Kagan : Well Sen .
Franken , I will say that when I wrote those words I was not speaking of Footnote Four in Carolene Products .
I was speaking instead of what I ’ve talked about several times at this hearing which is Justice Marshall ’s deep belief in insuring a level playing field for all Americans and insuring that each and every American regardless of wealth or power or privilege , that each and every American gets fairly heard before the court and when I wrote that tribute to Justice Marshall and wrote those words that was very much what I had in mind .
Franken :
So I ’d like to leave you with this thought , okay .
Justice Thurgood Marshall was one of the greatest lawyers , jurists in American history .
This is a man who won Brown v. Board of Education , who helped end segregation in our nations ’ schools and opened the doors to black Americans .
This is a man who proved that separate but equal was inherently unequal .
Not only that but he served with distinction as Solicitor General , as a judge on the Second Circuit and as the first African American Supreme Court Justice .
This is a giant of the American legal system .
And I think what I really want to say is that Justice Marshall was n’t some activist radical .
Rather his views were very much in the mainstream and in line with Constitutional jurisprudence since 1938 , since Carolene and before that .
And I just think that we need to be aware of that and germane about it .
Kagan : Sen. Franken
I ’ll just say what I said on many occasions in the past which is that Justice Marshall is a hero of American law and a hero of mine .
Franken :
And of mine .
Thank you .
Al proves once again why any Republicans that dismiss him as just being a comedian , do so at their peril .
Yeah , “ Russia sucks “ , Russian authorities are corrupt , but what are you going to do about it ?
Well , St Petersburg ’s renegade art - group of political pranksters – Voina ( War ) – turned a historic bridge into one giant “ Fuck You ! ” to the Russian federal agencies .
Here ’s how they pulled it off .
Over the years , Voina staged many actions : police station take - overs , anti-homophobic faux - lynchings in malls , stray cat throwing into swanky restaurants , anti-Medvedev public orgies and all kinds of ruckus .
Their most recent target : the headquarters of FSB , the offices of Russia ’s KGB incarnate Federal Security Service .
Our source : Voina themselves .
In the early morn of Che Guevara ’s birthday , the group psyched out bascule bridge guards and made their way onto Liteiny Bridge .
In 23 seconds flat , Voina painted a 213 - feet - tall , 89 - feet - wide phallus dubbed “ Giant Galactic Space Dick . ”
Voina ’s President ( a.k.a. Bucket Man ) was captured and roughed up by the guards after painting the right testicle - orb .
Unfortunately , the activists who were to write out an acronym directing the obscene gesture specifically at FSB got left behind , but as the bridge rose at 1:40 am directly in front of the FSB headquarters ’ windows , the symbol could be seen across the city .
At 2:00 am , the Galactic Dick stood as high as the bridge would go , threatening the FSB as planned .
Brigades of firefighters assembled below .
Citizens happily made their way to the bombed bridge for photo ops and cheers .
The group did not release their hilarious , culturally un-translatable statement until their President was freed from jail .
As the water hoses fired at the Galactic Dick , representatives were on hand to shout “ They destroyed a spectacular work of art by the group Voina ! ”
And that is how it ’s done .

They have been a familiar sight around the lake in Prospect Park in Brooklyn : Canada geese , scores of them .
To some residents , the birds and their fuzzy offspring are charming hints of wildlife amid the bricks of the city .
Recently , when one was found with an arrow through its neck , park rangers tried to corral it to administer first aid .
But then , over the last few days , parkgoers noticed something strange .
The geese were gone .
Nearly 400 of them .
On Monday , the answer emerged .
Wildlife biologists and technicians had descended on the park Thursday morning and herded the birds into a fenced area .
The biologists , working with the federal Agriculture Department , then packed the geese two or three to a crate and took them to a nearby building where they were gassed with lethal doses of carbon dioxide , Carol A. Bannerman , a spokeswoman , said .
Ms. Bannerman said the measure was necessary .
“ The thing to always remember in this New York situation is that we are talking about aviation and passenger and property safety , ” she said .
“ In New York City , from 1981 to 1999 , the population increase was sevenfold . ”
This week , Courtney Stoker of From Austin to A&M and Joseph Hewitt of GearHead RPG graced us with their presence to discuss the problem of making dude - dominated subcultures more accessible to women .
In the comments , you added your own tips :
Amy on refusing to GTFO :
Quote : “ When looking for online communities , I tend only to join those that are either explicitly feminist or women - friendly . ”
I find that very depressing .
As a woman , I ’ve never been bothered by whether a site / community is ‘ feminist ’ or not , or what proportion of it ’s users are male or female .
To restrict your access to sites on these criteria seems like a recipe for letting the boys - only clubs be , and confining ourselves to a polite little enclave .
Do you also suggest that women only apply to jobs in organisations that are already ‘ women - friendly ’ ?
I know the kind of reaction ( BOOBIES ! ) women get in male - dominated areas on the internet , but hiding away in the feminist areas is n’t going to change anything , it ’s going to make the idea of male - dominated areas seem * more * normal , as women voluntarily absent themselves .
grogette on self - preservation :
Or maybe it ’s a means of self preservation .
I tend to restrict my friends to feminists / progressives / antiracists / etc .
Why would I hang out with a bunch of * ists and make myself miserable ?
Hanging out on sites ( or with people ) that are feminist / feminist friendly does n’t mean someone does n’t interact with the rest of the world that ’s predominantly NOT feminist friendly .
Kit -Kat on moderation :
Decide what limits you want on your site , and then enforce them .
Have a posted policy about your lack of toleration for sexist / racist / otherwise gratuitously nasty comments / whatever you do n’t want on your site .
Call out violators .
If necessary , ban them from the site .
Do n’t just say it ’s a safe space –make it one .
PD on picking your battles :
I do n’t hang out in explicitly feminist or woman - friendly forums , but I do definitely avoid the ones where the misogyny is worst ( 4 chan , Cracked , etc . )
Some times the earth is just too salted to try and grow anything there .
On forums where the environment is a little more inclusive , I use it as an opportunity to encourage equality when ignorant comments do pop up .
It does n’t always work on its intended target , but at least it gets it out there .
Cat on gaming machismo :
I ’ve spent a lot of time in gaming communities and there ’s a really nasty , pervasive insularity there which is focused around straight , white , Anglo - American male bonding .
Men who would probably never harass a woman in real life feel that gaming communities are a special boys club where they get to degrade women , complain about female game characters not being hot enough and talking about raping opponents and making other players their bitches .
Machismo abounds .
I ’ve left many sites not because I ’m a crazy over - reacting feminist but because I have frequently had my concerns about negative attitudes dismissed .
“ Nobody here is seriously sexist , it ’s all in good fun . ”
“ Nobody really believes girls ca n’t play computer games . ”
“ There ’s nothing wrong with female characters showing skin , you ’re being over - sensitive . ”
Unfortunately , if I want to enjoy gaming , I am faced with the painful reality that my knowledge , abilities and character will be constantly devalued and ignored by a lot of other players .
I should n’t have to lurk behind a gender - neutral handle and watch forum members wax obnoxious about my gender .
I should n’t have to see those individuals hiding behind forum administration who protect them and refuse to moderate .
Clarisse
Thorn on getting women gamers engaged in the issue :
I used to work as a writer in the gaming field but stopped for several reasons , one of them being that I felt consistently objectified , etc .
I had one experience where the biggest company I worked for asked for advice on how to make one of their games more female - friendly ; I emailed a request for more specifics and never heard back , which makes me think that the question was more of a tossed - off “ oh I guess we should be thinking about this ” and less a sincere attempt to engage the question .
So it ’s heartening to see real attempts to address the question .
I would take a different angle with the “ take women ’s voices seriously ” thing , though .
I would n’t ask “ what do you want us to change ? ” but rather “ what are we doing right ? ” or “ can you point to places that you consider more female - friendly ? ” or even “ is it a priority for you that this space feel woman - friendly ?
please explain . ”
It ’s easier to work from positive feedback , particularly positive examples .
( Before someone leaps upon me screaming , please understand that I ’m not saying negative feedback is bad .
It ’s just hard to work from . )
I do suspect that many if not most women who are already hanging out in gaming spaces feel that :
1 ) The situation “ is n’t that bad ” , for whatever reason .
2 ) They ’re “ willing to put up with it ” and “ do n’t want to complain ” .
Which makes this question hard to develop .
Certainly , if you ’d asked me while I was a game writer whether it bothered me that my employers were constantly hitting on me etc etc. , I would very likely have been unwilling to get into it .

After receiving more than 3,000 reports of sudden acceleration in Toyota vehicles , the U.S. Department of Transportation has concluded that driver error was actually at fault .
According to The Wall Street Journal , investigators analyzing different data recorders from Toyota vehicles found that at the time of these sudden acceleration crashes , the throttles were wide open rather and the brakes were not depressed .
Thus , they have reason to believe that drivers were mistakenly stomping on the accelerator rather than slamming the brakes in an attempt to avoid these crashes .
Of the 75 fatal crashes blamed on sudden acceleration , only one incident has actually been verified as being caused by vehicle fault – the Lexus ES350 accident that killed a California highway patrolman and three other passengers last August .
Even so , this case was chalked up as an incident where the floor mat trapped the gas pedal , which Toyota quickly issued a recall for .
The WSJ also reports that U.S. Transportation Department officials have stated publicly that they have yet to find any electronic glitches in Toyota vehicles that could lead to these crashes .
The only defects proven to be true are those that have been outlined by Toyota itself – floor mats and sticky accelerator pedals that are slow to return to idle .
So while Toyota may not have been at fault in these sudden acceleration cases , the automaker 's image has indeed been seriously tarnished over the past few months .
Over eight million Toyota vehicles have been recalled worldwide – a large blemish in automotive history , and it appears that much of the hand - wringing may have been for naught .
Thanks to everyone for the tips !

Here are the preliminary results ( June 3 ) , as reported by Michael Schmidt :
To understand the results of our raw milk experiment it is important to tolerate the so called scientific demands .
That means in order to get accepted and being taken seriously by the scientific establishment you need to have 100 or 200 or 300 or may be even 1000 calves to make a scientific valid point .
However the simple fact that the so called experts have not yet entered into a joint research project as proposed by me already in 1994 has given me even a greater confidence that the results we have seen with these two calves are credible and significant .
They are in fact supporting the findings of Pottenger ’s cat study , which as well has been ignored and ridiculed .
The experiment was costing us over 5000 dollars just in milk .
This is a significant amount for us , since we did not get any support from corporate sponsors .
The weight of the two calves was basically equal at the beginning of the feeding trial .
At the end the raw milk calf weight 200 kg and the pasteurized milk calf weight 115 kg .
They gained weight almost equally for about 8 weeks and then the pasteurized milk calf started falling back .
A significant difference during the 4 month trial was always the different smell and the consistency of the manure .
The raw milk calf had mostly a well formed manure and normal smell you would expect .
Contrary to that the manure of the pasteurized calf was runny and the color mostly grey or almost white during the feeding trial .
We did not treat either of these calves for any condition .
We would have if there would have been a life threatening situation .
The hair on the raw milk calf was shiny and solid on the pasteurized calf dull and easily pulled out .
The alertness in the two calves was a major difference : the pasteurized calf seemed very uninterested with a clear lack of movement .
After nearly 5 months we could see that the pasteurized calf would have had difficulty to survive without medication and supplements .
Below are some of the pictures to show the obvious visual differences .
Forty - three years ago , when the nation lived in fear of Communist sympathizers and saboteurs , the Supreme Court said that even the need for national defense could not reduce the First Amendment rights of those associating with American Communists .
On Monday , in the first case since the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks to test free speech against the demands of national security in the age of terrorism , the ideals of an earlier time were eroded and free speech lost .
By preserving an extremely vague prohibition on aiding and associating with terrorist groups , the court reduced the First Amendment rights of American citizens .
The case was not about sending money to terrorist organizations or serving as their liaison , activities that are clearly and properly illegal .
And it did not stop people from simply saying they support the goals of groups like Hamas or Al Qaeda , as long as they are not actually working with those groups .
But it could have a serious impact on lawyers , journalists or academics who represent or study terrorist groups .
The case arose after an American human rights group , the Humanitarian Law Project , challenged the law prohibiting “ material support ” to terror groups , which was defined in the 2001 Patriot Act to include “ expert advice or assistance . ”
The law project wanted to provide advice to two terrorist groups on how to peacefully resolve their disputes and work with the United Nations .
The two groups  the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam and the Kurdistan Workers ’ Party  have violent histories and their presence on the State Department ’s official list of terrorist groups is not in dispute .
Note : Not at the old Poker1 site .
A version of this entry was originally published ( 2007 ) in Bluff magazine .
In some poker circles , I ’m best known for my work with the body language of poker , usually known as tells .
Mike Caro ’s Book of Tells will celebrate its silver anniversary in 2009 .
That ’s twenty - five years !
Parade permits for London , New York , Boston , Los Angeles , and Tulsa are nearing the final stages of being processed , pending receipt of applications .
I kind of got pigeonholed when that book was published .
I became better known for tells than anything else .
And that annoys me , because , actually , most of my research has dealt with statistics and strategy , often backed by my own computer analysis .
To put it simply , I ’m a cross between a nerd and a geek who has been misconstrued to be a people - observing , prescient , kind - hearted guru .
Oh , how that hurts !
Universal tendencies
Do n’t misread me —
I ’m proud of my book , and those tells have stood the test of time .
You do n’t hear many people arguing with words like “ Caro was wrong .
A player is n’t holding a strong hand when he does that ; he ’s bluffing . ”
And there ’s a reason you do n’t hear such quibbling .
All those tells came from deep within me and deep within other players .
When you learn about these tells , you instantly realize that , hey , they really are universal tendencies — players really do act that way to disguise their hands , because you tend to do that yourself !
Today , I ’m going to talk about bluffing .
Specifically , I ’m going to talk about how to know when an opponent is bluffing through use of tells .
Here are some major things you need to know :
Keys to bluffing
Bluffers are afraid to trigger your calling reflex .
I ’ve previously shared the secrets surrounding the “ calling reflex . ”
The concept is that nobody comes to a poker room hoping to throw away hands .
Instead , players gather at the table hoping to play hands and make calls .
This bias toward calling , rather than folding , means that players are more suspicious than they should be .
Any erratic movement or speech coming from the bettor is apt to trigger their calling reflex or , at least , to make a call more likely .
Now , here ’s the deal .
You and I understand that intellectually .
But others understand it unconsciously .
Years of poker warfare have made them vaguely aware that their actions can cause suspicion in opponents .
That ’s why most bluffers refrain from taking actions that might cause suspicion and trigger calls .
In fact , sometimes bluffers barely breathe .
On rare occasions , they do n’t breathe at all .
I carefully observe opponents breathing when they bet .
Often bluffers tend to take unusually shallow breaths .
They ’re afraid that loud breathing will lead to suspicion and a resulting call .
So they over compensate .
Watch carefully to see how an opponent breaths under normal circumstances .
If that player ’s breathing is significantly less pronounced following a bet , there ’s a good chance you ’re up against a weak hand or a bluff .
This advice is especially valuable on final - round bets in limit games and anytime a large wager is made in no -limit games .
Bluffers are unusually still .
You should always note how animated an opponent is after betting .
There is often an obvious decrease in movement if an opponent is bluffing .
Players who have wagered on strong hands are typically more relaxed and their movements appear natural .
Bluffers are more rigid and restrained .
Often they freeze .
They try to appear invisible , fearing that the slightest motion will trigger your call .
Think of a person hiking through the mountains and encountering a rattle snake .
If they ’re smart , they ’ll freeze , wanting to do nothing that will encourage a strike .
That ’s how bluffers act .
If bluffers move at all , it ’s usually at the last moment in desperation when a call seems almost inevitable .
But , even at that final , fateful moment , most tend to remain still .
Bluffers can’t carry on sensible conversations .
If you ’re not certain if your opponent is bluffing , try to initiate a chat .
Those with significant hands are able to talk normally , and what they say makes sense .
Bluffers will often sound stilted , instead .
Their words — if they talk at all — will seem unfocused and unnatural .
Bluffers may look back at their cards when you begin to call .
If you ’re still not sure whether your opponent is bluffing , fake a call .
Reach menacingly toward your chips .
As a sign of panic , bluffers may look back at their cards , trying to convince you that they hold something monumental .
This is a dead giveaway .
Players who really do hold strong hands wo n’t take any action at that key instant to stop you from completing the desired call .
They ’ll simply stay still and let it happen .
Bluffers do n’t show any change in mood whether you appear to be calling or raising .
Here ’s an advanced ploy I sometimes use to elicit clues about whether an opponent is bluffing .
First , I ’ll count out enough chips to call .
Then , after a dramatic pause , I ’ll add to the call amount , suggesting I ’m planning to raise , instead .
Players who hold strong hands often will react differently .
A call and a raise are dissimilar to a player betting from legitimate strength .
A call may be desired and a raise worrisome .
So , if I see a change in reaction , it ’s more likely that the bettor has genuine strength .
But bluffers do n’t care .
A raise and a call spell the same doom , so their reaction is unlikely to change .
If I see no modification in response , I give more credence to the conclusion that the opponent is bluffing .
Anyway , I hope that helps .
Gotta go , phone ’s ringing .

IT SOUNDS straightforward enough .
In the words of Stephan Miller , spokesman for Jerusalem city : “ Once any construction project in the city of Jerusalem has completed the permit process … it can begin construction , irrelevant of race , religion , creed and gender . ”
But there is the rub .
Race , religion , creed and sometimes even gender are supremely relevant if the Holy City , a complex web of separate Jewish and Arab districts , is ever to be divided peaceably into the capitals of two states , Israel and Palestine .
A series of Jewish settlement - projects inside Arab districts of East Jerusalem threaten to exacerbate tensions in the city .
But the mayor , Nir Barkat , seems determined to push them forward regardless .
The prime minister , Binyamin Netanyahu , due to meet President Barack Obama in Washington on July 6th , has been embarrassed by Jerusalem 's building plans before .
But his attempts to stop or at least defer them are sporadic .
His critics say they are half - hearted , too , because ideologically the prime minister sympathises with the settlers .
Indeed , Mr Netanyahu 's aides point out that , though subscribing since last year to the “ two - state solution ” , he has never accepted that Jerusalem need be divided , or that part of it should be the Palestinians ' capital .
Mr Miller was referring to the old Shepherd 's Hotel in the Arab district of Sheikh Jarrah , a long - empty building that a Jewish - American developer has bought and proposes to turn into apartments for Jewish settlers .
Work began at the site this week , under the protection of armed civilian guards .
Another Jewish building project in the same district requires the eviction of 28 Palestinian families , many of whom have been living there for more than 50 years .
Israeli Jews and local Palestinians now protest there , relatively peacefully , each week .
However , bullet - marked walls and damaged cars attested this week to the much less peaceful activity around another chain of Jewish settlement - sites , deep within the steep , winding lanes of the Arab district of Silwan which sprawls beneath the Old City walls to the south .
Palestinian residents described how on June 27th police charged through Silwan 's narrow thoroughfares firing tear - gas grenades through windows and doors , choking people inside their homes .
They produced the spent canisters as evidence .
Much more seriously , they exhibited cartridge cases of live ammunition , claiming that the civilian employees of private - guard companies fired in the air in response to stone - throwing by Palestinian youths .
In the nights that followed , police raided the district and carted off teenagers , some as young as 12 , on suspicion of stone - throwing .
Sucking ice - creams in the hot , dusty alleys in the morning , the youngsters looked no worse for their night inside , though some said they were slapped and all asserted proudly that they were shouted at and threatened by the policemen .
Staying put in Silwan
The trouble - spots that sparked this week 's violence are a 12 - flat settler apartment block called Beit Yonatan , which the Israeli Supreme Court has ordered evacuated and sealed off because it was built illegally , and , nearby , a Palestinian apartment block that was once a synagogue .
Jewish settlers are demanding that the Palestinian families leave , as the building is owned by Jews .
Uri Ariel , a Knesset member , says if the police do not oust the families he will do so himself on July 4th .
Police units are deploying around the district in preparation for what threatens to be another violent Sunday .
Silwan is also the site of a large and controversial building plan adopted last week by the municipality 's planning committee .
Mr Barkat proposes a $ 50 m park - and - tourism complex for the valley of Silwan .
It would be called the King 's Garden , and would extend from a popular archaeological site known as the City of David , opposite the Old City walls , to form a national park in honour of the biblical king .
The project will mean demolishing 22 Palestinian homes , built illegally over the past two decades , and moving the residents to new homes nearby .
In an effort , so far unsuccessful , to win local consent , the mayor is offering retroactive building licences for another 60 - odd homes in the area , also built illegally .
But local people are not tempted .
They say the illegal building is the result of decades of Israeli refusals to grant building licences to Palestinians .
And they do not wish to celebrate King David 's life and legend .
The mayor holds out to them the prospect of a better , greener life in Silwan ; but they see his scheme as yet more “ Judaisation ” of the Holy City .

To me , Tool 's Lateralus is the most amazing piece of music ever composed .
I think Tool deliberately wanted to give their fans something truly amazing , but wanted them to find it on their own .
" Recognize this as a holy gift ... "
At first , I thought that the song Lateralus was about tripping acid - discovering true color by seperating the body from the mind .
At first listen , I imagined the bending envelope as an intense visual .
After becoming more familiar with the track , however , I had reformed my interpretation to something broader : think deeper .
Lateralus , perhaps because it is the album 's " title track " , serves as the central clue for a puzzle that a friend of mine had read about somewhere on the internet .
" All I know is that there is a different order for the songs - something about two spirals .
Oh yeah , and thirteen is in the middle . "
After scavenging through endless google search results , I gave up on finding more about this ' alternate order ' .
Intent to figure the album out , and very curious about the spirals - I put on the proverbial ' thinking cap ' .
I understood how the spirals could have a lot of significance , in that the album 's title track offers the inspiring , " swing on the spiral of our divinity and still be a human .......... And following our will and wind we may just go where no one 's been .
We 'll ride the spiral to the end and may just go where no one 's been . "
In my internet scavenging , I had read one review , written by a drummer , who mentioned that Danny Carey 's drum beat formed a fibonacci sequence during the song Lateralus .
A drummer myself , I decided to get out the graph paper and follow Danny .
I can't play like he can , but at least I can hear everything he 's doing , and thus was able to construct the drum tabulature .
Sure enough , Danny repeats a Fibonacci sequence through the number 13 : 1,1,2,3,5,8,13 .
After 13 , he starts again with 1 .
Bringing in my Algebra 2 knowledge of the Fibonacci sequence , when the equation for the Fibonacci sequence ( which I do n't actually know ) is graphed , it forms a sprial whose vertex depends on the number at which the sequence begins .
Coincidence ?
I began to think not .
I had already known of Danny 's obsession with sacred geometry and am familiar with Bob Frissell 's book , Nothing in This Book Is True , But It 's Exactly How Things Are , so the significance of what I had stumbled upon had actually begun to settle in .
This is where I just had to play with Lateralus .
I had doodled a few spirals in the corners of my graph paper , and in doing so made the first important connection to Lateralus .
I knew that if the tracks were in fact intended to be heard in a different order , " Parabol " and " Parabola " would have to go together .
In drawing my spirals , I had begun with a vertex and ' spiraled ' outwards .
After writing the numbers 1 through 13 linearly , I could immediately see that Parabol and Parabola would have to be the middle of my spiral ( in that 13 / 2 = 6.5 ) .
I drew a simple arrow between 6 and 7 and then pondered the next pair .
At first , I actually drew a spiral connecting pairs of numbers whose sum equaled 13 ( the number of songs on the album ) .
This , however , left the last track in the same position and without anything to connect to .
At this time , I had used my copy of Lateralus and Cool Edit Pro to take out the silences between tracks and put the songs in the following order :
6,7,5,8,4,9,3,10,2,11,1,12,13 .
The transition from Parabola into Schism blew my mind , as the plucks , probably dismissed by listeners as a drawn out rant of an ending , perfectly transition into the beginning of Schism .
When you count out beats as the strings are plucked , Schism resumes with the same time signature and tempo - mirroring the progression of notes .
The transition from Schism into Ticks & Leeches is equally intriguing .
Schism ends with strong double - kick bass and tom smacks , and Ticks & Leeches begins with what many would call a ' tribal ' drum beat .
The beat at the very start of Ticks & Leeches is slightly different every subsequent time it is repeated - the measures are two beats longer .
Yup - you guessed it - those two beats are ACTUALLY the last two beats of Schism .
I can honestly say that I never understood the album 's fourth track , Mantra until reordering the album 's songs .
What I had originally heard as whale calls now had begun to resemble the worst imaginable dry heaves - or a stylized choking .
Fitting , seeing as how the last line in Ticks & Leeches is " I hope you choke . "
After this transition , none of those following it really seemed to make much sense .
I certainly did n't like that Disposition and Reflection had been seperated - as they sound quite good when played sequentially on the album .
This was the only real roadblock in my disciphering of the Holy Gift .
Then I had remembered what my friend had told me - 13 was in the middle .
At the time , probably just wanting to believe that there was more to this cd , I had equated this to the positioning of the song " Intermission " on the previous release , Ænema .
For the song to be in the ' middle ' of the album it would have to be the seventh track in sequence , here having six tracks on either side of it .
So I inserted Faaip de Oiad after Lateralus , and almost peed my pants when I discovered that ( ever - so - faintly ) the fading tone of the last note of Lateralus could be heard in beginning of Faaip de Oiad , and how the distortion of the guitars at the tail end of Lateralus resembled , and later transitioned seamlessly into , the static at the beginning of Faaip de Oiad .
The lyrics of Lateralus justify this break in the spiral , almost instructing : " spiral out , keep going , spiral out , keep going . "
I went back to Lateralus to find the next clue .
In Danny Carey 's amazingly competent Fibonacci sequence , he had stopped at 13 and gone back to 1 .
This is what I chose to do to finish the sequence .
A second spiral was now constucted , and the order for the Holy Gift now became 6,7,5,8,4,9,13,1,12,2,11,3,10 .
Already many of you are probably fascinated at what I have revealed to you , but I can not even begin to tell you what this new order has opened up for me .
The beauty of Lateralus is very , very fragile and has to be viewed with a very open mind .
It can also be different when looked at from different points of view .
Aside from the fact that the new order of the songs places them in an order where they flow together nicely - often ending and resuming on the same notes or within the same progression , and some times - in the case of Lateralus into Faaip de Oiad and The Grudge into Triad - even overlapping ( though admittadly sound much better when actually electronically overlapped , this is kind of cheating .
Consider this a hint , however , if you plan on doing this yourself ) , the two spirals help to tell a story that every Tool fan should hear .
In the interest of not boring the only casually intrigued , I will try to keep this very brief .
I would also recommend familiarizing yourselves with Frissell 's book ( yeah - the one I mentioned earlier ) .
I consider Parabol and Parabola to be quite expository .
Maynard wants us to know that no matter what happens , we must all know that this is not our only existance .
Our very minds and the contents of our subconscious are intended to be immortal , and if we accept this into our lives ( be it because of personal or religious reasons ) , it will be so .
As such , pain is an illusion .
At first , I called it " The Lateralus Prophecy " ( for reasons you will soon understand ) , but I have since decided to call the ' reordered ' version of Lateralus " The Holy Gift " .
As Maynard says , " Recognize this as a holy gift and celebrate this chance to be alive and breathing , " I take the word " this " to mean much more than just his simple cautioning .
Since Parabola is the second track of the Holy Gift , it can be considered at the beginning ( esp. considering the context of it's duality with Parabol ) , and as such , I interpret Maynard 's words as more than just clever lyrics in a song .
They are a plead for his listeners to listen to everything he has to say and truly celebrate the chance of immortality offered throughout .
I would be lying if I said that each song has a specific translation .
On the contrary , Tool 's music is designed to make you think , not say something specific .
It must be treated like great literature - much is hidden contextually .
I will elude to Geometric - Drumming 's previous post , where he explains the time signatures of Schism : " It represents the title ... it's arranged in 12/8 time which is SPLIT into 5/8 and 7/8 - which only really FITS as you PUT THE PIECES BACK TOGETHER . "
Where Geometric - Drumming claims Schism as his favorite Tool song , I have heard some fans say that it was a retched pick for the album 's only single - but I think it was brilliant .
Not to downplay the interpretations of those who have posted before me ( in fact , I agree with much of what % BlueSoulRobot % has to say ) , but I think that to the casual listener who knows nothing of Tool , it can be a powerful invitation .
Think about it - a lot of dingbats with MTV and a radio would walk around with the words " I know the pieces fit " in their heads .
I wonder how many of them took the time to put the pieces back together to ( re ) discover what is trying to be communicated .
I welcome any feedback .
I would love to share interpretations of the songs via email - just too lengthy to post here .
I would like to offer the following advice : DO NOT use MP3s to digitally reorder Lateralus .
A lot of VERY IMPORTANT information is encoded on the actual cd .
Ever notice how everyone who has lost or broken that cd has IMMEDIATELY gone out and bought a new copy ?
I know I have .
It 's because there are things encoded on the factory pressing of the cd that are lost in the mp3 compression process and any direct copy onto a cd-r .
If you want to do it , do it right - I can't stress how important this is .
Use the cda tracks as you put it together and maintain all audio fidelity using professional mixing software .
There 's a Fibonacci in Maynard 's lyrics , specifically the syllables :
black [ 1 ]
then [ 1 ]
white are [ 2 ]
all I see [ 3 ]
in my infancy [ 5 ]
red and yellow then came to be [ 8 ]
reaching out to me [ 5 ]
lets me see [ 3 ]
there is [ 2 ]
so [ 1 ]
much [ 1 ]
more and [ 2 ]
beckons me [ 3 ]
to look through to these [ 5 ]
infinite possibilities [ 8 ]
as below so above and beyond I imagine [ 13 ]
drawn outside the lines of reason [ 8 ]
push the envelope [ 5 ]
watch it bend [ 3 ]
I suppose it 's not actually a true Fibonacci , since it does reverse itself .
the Fibonacci Sequence .
It 's basically a string of numbers that when you add a number to the number before it , you get the next number .
Starting with the numbers 0 and 1 . 0+1=1 , so the set now looks like this ; 0 1 1 . You take the 1 and add the previous number ( 1 ) and you get 2 .
The sequence looks like this ; 0 1 1 2 . Now you take the 2 and add the previous number and get 3 .
Now you have 0 1 1 2 3 . When you add the 3 and the 2 you get 5 . 0 1 2 3 5 . 5+3=8 . 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 . The process continues .
So ... whatcha doin ' over there on that laptop , denizens of the world ?
Well , according to a new study from Nielsen showing Internet usage in April 2010 , 22 % of the time , you 're engaging with social media .
Yeah , 22 % might not seem like a mammoth percentage , but you have to take into account the fact that this finding is on a global scale .
Also , a few more telling takeaways from the report :
Currently , three quarters of Internet users worldwide visit a social network or blog when they go online — that 's a 24 % increase over last year .
Joe Average ( the international version ) spends 66 % more time on these sites than he did a year ago — for example , your average user spent 6 hours on these sites in April 2010 , while last year he spent 3 hours , 31 minutes .
Facebook , YouTube and Wikipedia make an appearance among the world 's most popular brands .
We 've seen ample proof of the burgeoning popularity of social media in the past — just two months ago , Nielsen reported similar growth — and it makes sense .
Facebook has been giving Google a run for its money when it comes to traffic , and YouTube recently surpassed two billion views per day .
We 'll have to see how social media usage shakes out as Facebook continues to accrue users , and YouTube dips its toe into the newsfeed business in an attempt to become a legit news source .
In the meantime , check out a few more highlights from the study :
Brazil boasts the largest percentage of Internet users visiting a social network –- 86 %
Australians spend the most time on social networking sites : an average of 7 hours and 19 minutes in April — the U.S. and Italy came in second and third with six and a half hours each .
Facebook has the greatest share of the market in Italy in April 2010 , garnering two - thirds of the active unique audience in April 2010 .
Australia , the U.S. and the UK came in on Italy 's heels with more than 60 % of active users visiting the site .
How much time do you spend on social networking sites ?
Has your hunger for social media contributed to this global increase ?

MSNBC has posted a short video on Star Wars : The Old Republic which features short clips with Greg Zeschuk and Blaine Christine .
There is n’t anything new revealed , but may be worth a look if you are interested in seeing a more mainstream viewpoint of the game .
Watch the video here !
A former South Korean SO officer warns Pyongyang is looking for a casus belli to drag peninsula into war .
Called to settle the question , the United Nations condemns “ actions against peace ” .
Seoul ( AsiaNews / Agencies ) – North Korea has 180.000 soldiers set to invade South Korea , said former South Korean commander of Special Operations Kim Yun-suk during a ceremony at the War Memorial in Seoul .
They include 40,000 Special Forces troops , as well as a “ Storm ” Corps whose mission is to infiltrate South Korea and start a war .
North Korea ’s stand - by force includes around 10,000 naval Special Forces and 5,000 air force soldiers who can be moved into places rapidly .
The Storm Corps , which includes four light infantry , seven airborne and three sniper brigades , has been trained to create confusion and cause havoc behind enemy lines .
“ Ten thousand North Korean special forces are capable of infiltrating simultaneously through underground tunnels or aboard 260 hovercraft or submarines , while 175 AN - 2 transport planes and 310 helicopters can transport another 10,000 troops , " Kim said .
For the former SO commander , South Korea must take the necessary steps to deal with this asymmetric threat by creating its own powerful Special Forces brigade , operating a special military branch that handles North Korea 's irregular forces and boosting the number of anti-terrorism units and training .
In any event , such a statement is bound to add fuel to the tensions now gripping the Korean Peninsula .
After ROKN corvette Cheonan was sunk a few months , which Seoul blames on the North , both Korean states have taken the matter to the United Nations for a resolution .
So far , the Security Council has limited itself to issuing a statement , condemning “ actions against peace in the peninsula . ”
Image caption Universal deny any link between themselves and the tour vote
Universal Music Group ( UMG ) has denied any involvement in a poll that became the target of an online prank .
A website that asked people where the Canadian singer Justin Bieber should tour next finally received 650,000 votes to send him to North Korea .
A spokesperson for UMG told BBC News that it was a " hoax " but declined to give any further comment .
The poll was promoted by members of the imageboard website 4 chan , urging their users to vote for North Korea .
The joke eventually turned viral , spreading onto Facebook and Twitter , with tens of thousands of people casting their vote on the site .
4chan has a long history of pulling off internet pranks and stunts .
In early July , Justin Bieber videos on YouTube were the target for internet hackers , redirecting users to adult websites or triggering pop-up messages saying that the Canadian singer had died in a car crash .
Google temporarily suspended commenting on videos and issued a statement saying : " We took swift action to fix a cross - site scripting ( XSS ) vulnerability . "
The vulnerability hole was patched a few hours later .
Justin Bieber was signed to Island Records , part of the Universal Music Group , after his performances were posted on You Tube .
With all the awesome stuff going on at E3 right now ( ie. the Nintendo 3Ds and it ’s shitload of awesome games , new Mortal Kombat , Bulletstorm , Donkey Kong Country Returns , Kirby ’s Epic Yarn , Twisted Metal , Portal 2 ) you would think it would be easy for me to come up with a new idea for a comic .
And you would be right , because I did .
Unfortunately , coming up with an idea and actually having the time allotted to do so are two different things .
I wish I could talk about what is taking up all my time .
But I find that if I actually talk about said projects they never come to fruition .
Let ’s just say that there ’s a lot that ’s going on and hopefully I will be able to prove it pretty soon .
So during the interim , let ’s just enjoy a classic Dueling Analogs and then weigh in on your opinions about this year ’s E3 .
I ’ll start …
Nothing from the Microsoft camp at E3 really excites me .
It ’s about friggin’ time that Twisted Metal is coming out for the PS3 .
Nintendo pretty much dominated the show .
I really want to get a hold of a Nintendo 3 Ds .
Game wise : Donkey Kong Country Returns , Kirby ’s Epic Yarn and Kid Icarus equal awesome .
Disappointed that the Wii HD was not announced .
I really thought it would be .
I like how Mortal Kombat is returning to it ’s roots .
And Bulletstorm looks frantically sweet .

Astronauts close to finding source of air leak at Space Station
Washington DC ( UPI ) Oct 01 , 2020
NASA says astronauts on the International Space Station are closing in on the source of a small air leak that had been growing in size .
Astronauts first became aware of a leak at the station more than a year ago , but have n't been able to find the specific source .
Officials said the size of the leak has grown larger in recent months .
Tenants of the space station began to check each module this week after being alerted by flight controllers .

It is a debate that will run and run but , where the fashion industry is concerned , clearly size does matter .
In remarks that will come as a disappointment to campaigners for diversity in fashion , the designer Julien Macdonald has dismissed the recent rise of plus - size models , insisting that " a catwalk model is a size six to eight " .
In an interview , the British designer , who is also a judge on the reality TV show Britain 's Next Top Model , said of the competition : " This is a serious show .
You can't have a plus - size girl winning – it makes it a joke . "
Macdonald 's comments may be at odds with the general turnaround in fashion , but the Welsh designer knows how to generate helpful controversy : his spring / summer 2007 collection provoked animal rights groups who felt it relied too heavily on fur , and his search for the country 's Next Top Model will no doubt get a boost in ratings .
His remarks to Wales on Sunday come after a year which has seen several high - profile magazines electing to use plus - size models , as well as designers booking bigger models to appear in their catwalk shows .
" A programme like Britain 's Next Top Model could have pushed the boundaries a little further by recognising the shift in thinking and looking for a size 10 instead , " said the fashion commentator Caryn Franklin , co-founder of All Walks Beyond the Catwalk , which campaigns for diversity in modelling .
" There 's big money to be made by models with curves , as everyone but Julien knows . "
Since the British Fashion Council 's 2007 Model Health Enquiry , the issue has never been far from the headlines , but the past 12 months have seen good progress in bringing diversity to the glossies .
In June 2009 , the editor of British Vogue , Alexandra Shulman , wrote a letter to designers asking them to adjust their sizings because her magazine had been photoshopping models to look bigger , after " minuscule sizes " forced them to hire models with " jutting bones and no breasts or hips " .
Two months later , American Glamour printed a picture of size 12 Lizzie Miller , in which a roll of stomach was clearly visible ; then Germany 's most popular women 's magazine , Brigitte , pledged only to use real women in its shoots ; and in January 2010 V ran a " size issue " , in which the photographer Terry Richardson shot the sample - sized Jacquelyn Jablonski next to the size 16 supermodel Crystal Renn .
" The fashion world needs to change , " Renn told The Independent .
" Women on the street do n't relate to all this talk of plus sizes , and it creates an " us and them " mentality within the industry , which leads to comments like the ones Julien Macdonald has made . "
I 've learned about this video today .
Apparently it was a huge meme in 2010 that I 've missed .
Shame on me .
This is completely replayable .
I am addicted to this video .
I hate you for being this good .

Organizer : “ It was very scary ” to be bullhorned by Alex Jones , elitists paranoid about growing opposition
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet.com
Friday , June 4 , 2010
An astounding exchange between Bilderberg conference organizers overheard by a London Guardian journalist reveals that the elitists currently gathering at the Hotel Dolce Sitges in Spain see people with income as “ a threat ” to their agenda , highlighting the fact that the globalists are intent on eviscerating the middle class and lowering living standards .
The details of the conversation were revealed in Charlie Skelton ’s latest Bilderberg blog for the Guardian website .
Skelton was the last journalist to leave the Hotel Dolce Sitges .
Increasing awareness , media coverage , and protests directed against the Bilderberg Group has the secretive organization running scared about the global awakening to the new world order agenda that is now unfolding at an accelerated pace .
During a Council on Foreign Relations meeting in Montreal last month , prominent Bilderberg member Zbigniew Brzezinski lectured fellow elitists about how the perils of a “ global political awakening ” were threatening to derail the move towards a one world government .
“ For the first time in all of human history mankind is politically awakened – that ’s a total new reality – it has not been so for most of human history , ” said Brzezinski , adding that people had become “ consciously aware of global inequities , inequalities , lack of respect , exploitation . ”
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Similar sentiments were echoed by Bilderberg meeting organizers in Spain this week , according to London Guardian writer Charlie Skelton , who in his latest article details a fascinating exchange between Bilderbergers , who are apparently still upset about how they were vociferously bullhorned by Alex Jones at the 2006 meeting in Ottawa Canada .
“ They were very close to the hotel , ” said one .
Another looked shocked and asked : “ Did they ever try to attack ? ” A shake of the head and the answer : “ No , but it was very scary . ”
A third leaned in : “ This is the negative side of the welfare state .
People have enough income , so they can do this – it ’s like a permanent threat . ”
From this brief snippet of conversation we can deduce two very important things .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
One – Bilderbergers loathe attention and they are furious that the efforts of activists , in combination with the growth of the Internet as an independent media tool , have shone a brighter light on their secret scheming in recent years .
They are now very afraid of being completely exposed and attracting protesters in the thousands rather than the mere tens of activists who petition Bilderberg annually .
Recent gatherings in Turkey and Greece attracted hundreds of protesters , but if more people come to realize the fact that Bilderberg enjoys more influence over world events than the G20 , their whole existence is under threat because their meetings will be constantly disrupted .
Two – The Bilderberg organizer who derided the fact that “ people have enough income ” to actually travel to where Bilderberg are meeting and protest their agenda tells us everything we need to know about what that agenda is .
These elitists cannot stand the fact that a few of the unwashed masses still have the financial means to exercise their rights , which is why the globalists are busy trying to eviscerate our standard of living with higher taxes , austerity measures , and CO2 levies that amount to a consumption tax .
The elite see a prosperous middle class , or even those who are barely scraping an income , as “ a threat ” to their power monopoly .
By carrying out their promise of a “ post - industrial revolution , ” allied with a “ green economy ” that in reality will cripple once thriving economies , they hope to make the population all but destitute to the point where their main concern will not be protesting 200 elitists meeting at luxury holiday resorts , but simply where the next meal is coming from
As Skelton points out , the only “ threat ” to Bilderbergers is if the people find out what they are actually doing behind closed doors .
“ What threat ?
That people concerned about the unfairness of the world should drape a banner over a police cordon ?
That they should shout their anger at the madness of asset - grabbing transnational corporations , whose chairmen are sipping beers with our elected officials ?
“ It ’s like a permanent threat . ”
Do n’t make me spit , ” he writes .
Watch a clip of the one thing Bilderberg are terrified of – exposure – specifically Alex Jones ’ bullhorn and all the protesters that are bringing attention to this year ’s gathering of the criminal plutocrats in Sitges , Spain .

In this latest edition of Expert to Expert ( and Going Deep ) , the great Brian Beckman , astrophysicist and software architect , is joined by Greg Meredith , a mathematician and computer scientist .
It 's just bound to be an intellectual jam session !
The idea for the format of this conversation is simple : put two geniuses together , give them each a whiteboard and some markers , and see what happens .
It 's much like free jazz : expert improvisation , seriously geeked - out whiteboard jamming .
The content theme for this episode -- Monads as coordinate systems -- is not simple .
To grok this , we need to think in three dimensions : programming , physics and mathematics .
But do n't worry .
Brian and Greg do not expect to be jamming in front of only fellow experts .
This is Channel 9 , after all , and there are many different levels of knowledge out there amongst our Niner population .
Accordingly , you will not feel as though you 're watching something in a language you do n't speak .
That said , you should possess interests in the theoretical , in mathematics , and in physics , and an overall appreciation for learning new things .
This is a fantastic whiteboard jam session with two very interesting , very bright , and very knowledgeable experimental theoreticians .

Ronnie James Dio , a legendary heavy metal singer who replaced Ozzy Osbourne in Black Sabbath and also was lead singer for the bands Rainbow and Dio , has died .
He was 67 .
Dio died Sunday , according to a statement on his website by Wendy Dio , his wife and manager .
Maureen O’Connor , a Los Angeles publicist , said Dio died in Los Angeles .
No cause was given , but Dio had said last summer that he was suffering from stomach cancer .
“ Today my heart is broken , ” Wendy Dio wrote .
“ Many , many friends and family were able to say their private goodbyes before he peacefully passed away . ”
Dio replaced Osbourne in Black Sabbath in 1979 .
His first album with Sabbath , “ Heaven and Hell , ” helped rejuvenate the group , selling more than 1 million copies .
But Dio left soon after the release of “ Mob Rules ” in 1981 to form Dio .

He returned to Black Sabbath briefly in the 1990s and more recently had formed Heaven & Hell , basically a version of the band without Osbourne .
“ Because I ’ve been in and out of [ a number of bands ] , people think I ’m difficult , ” he told The Times in 1997 .
“ That [ probably ] comes about because I ’m very intense about what I do .
I have a really high standard , and I expect people around me to reach that standard as well .
That ’s probably unfair . ”
He was born Ronald James Padavona on July 10 , 1942 , in Portsmouth , N.H. , and raised in New York .
He once said he would have preferred playing for the Yankees to a life in rock music .
He started his career with local bands such as the Vegas Kings .
His career took off in 1975 when he joined Rainbow .
Dio had been playing with Elf , a band originally called the Electric Elves , but after guitarist Ritchie Blackmore quit Deep Purple , he brought most of the band into Rainbow .

“ With a guy who played guitar like Ritchie … and had this dark demeanor , it was perfect for me to get into a place where I could start writing darker and heavier things that I always wanted to do , ” he told the Press & Sun-Bulletin of Binghamton , N.Y , in 2007 .
Many of Dio ’s most memorable songs revolved around the struggle between good and evil , including “ Heaven and Hell . ”
He also drew heavily on medieval imagery in such songs as “ Neon Knights , ” “ Killing The Dragon ” and “ Stargazer . ”
“ I consider myself a singer , not a shouter , ” he told the Buffalo News in 2007 .
“ It ’s always interesting to me when over the years fans have come up to me and said , ‘ Man , nobody screams like you ! ’
I know they mean it as a compliment , but inside I ’m going , ‘ I ’m not a screamer , I ’m a singer . ’
It ’s about a marriage of technique and feel , emotional content — not just screaming . ”
In 1986 , Dio organized “ Hear N ’ Aid , ” an all - star charity collaboration to raise money for famine relief in Africa .
Advertisement
“ He possessed one of the greatest voices in all of heavy metal and had a heart to match it , ” Twisted Sister guitarist Jay Jay French , whose band has toured with Dio since 1983 , told the Associated Press .
Dio called off a European tour last year to begin treatment for his cancer .
“ Most people have careers that last from three to five years , especially in metal , ” he told The Times in 1997 .
“ When you ’ve have this good a run , you certainly do n’t complain . ”
Along with his wife , Dio is survived by a son , Daniel ; his father , Pat Padavona ; and two grandchildren , according to O’Connor .

The rise of the free - to - play western MMO has n't gone unnoticed at Blizzard , developers of World of Warcraft , the dominant western subscription MMO .
Speaking to PC Gamer at their studios in Irvine , California , World of Warcraft 's lead designer , Tom Chilton , explained that " at some point , it may not make sense for us to have a subscription fee . "
Tom was speaking about the rapid expansion of free - to - play games in the west , and the terms under which Blizzard would consider a similar model for World of Warcraft .
In the last year , classic western hardcore online games such as Lord of the Rings Online , Company of Heroes and Dungeons and Dragons Online have all embraced a free - to - play model , where microtransactions and item purchases are a substitute for a traditional subscription fee .
Yet Tom does n't think those games have gone free just to compete with World of Warcraft .
" I feel like they 're doing that to compete with other games that are on a similar subscriber level to what they were at .
I imagine that when one of them went free to play it cannibalized some of the other subscribers .
I can definitely imagine that being the case with World of Warcraft .
If another game comes along and blows us away it may not make sense for us to have a subscription fee .
Or even further down the line , when we have another MMO out . "
While the western view of World of Warcraft is that it's a subscription - only MMO , the Blizzard team have long experimented with alternates to a traditional subscription to remain competitive in different markets .
Multiple micro-transaction items are available to buy for the most committed World of Warcraft players - including shiny star horses , and warrior panda pets .
In Korea , the game is sold purely via subscription fee , with no boxed product available .
And Korean World of Warcraft subscribers will get to play StarCraft II for free , too .
In Russia , StarCraft II is sold in small monthly instalments - a salve to a market where piracy is rampant .
Do n't cancel your subscription just yet though : WoW is n't going free - to - play in the near term .
When asked if Blizzard were actively considering the implications of a free - to - play model , Tom played down the idea of the game switching over right away .
" We 're not spending a lot of time thinking about it .
It 's not something that 's a reality for us in the near future . "
We 've got much , much more on World of Warcraft : Cataclysm in the new issue of PC Gamer , on - sale tomorrow .
We 'll be posting more Cataclysm news , impressions , and interviews over the coming week .
Prime Minister Julia Gillard has promised standards that would ban the building of new " dirty " power stations - but her policy would not cover up to 12 coal - fired plants already proposed across the country .
Launching the first piece of a revised climate policy , Ms Gillard proposed greenhouse gas emissions standards that would rule out new brown - coal fired stations in Victoria unless they came with " clean coal " technology .
But the standards would not stop the development of new black - coal power plants in NSW , Queensland and Western Australia .
The standard would apply only to new stations that are not yet proposed , and could change after consultation with state governments , the energy industry and environment groups .
University of Queensland research has found the Nanopatch - a needle - free , pain - free method of vaccine delivery - is now dissolvable , eliminating the possibility of needle - stick injury .
Project leader Professor Mark Kendall , from the Australian Institute for Bioengineering and Nanotechnology , said the finding confirmed that the Nanopatch was a potential safer , cheaper alternative to needle vaccines .
The study was published recently in scientific journal Small .
“ What we have been able to show for the first time is that the Nanopatch is completely dissolvable , ” Professor Kendall said .
“ That means zero needles , zero sharps , zero opportunity for contamination and zero chance of needle - stick injury .
“ The World Health Organisation estimates that 30 percent of vaccinations in Africa are unsafe due to cross contamination caused by needle - stick injury .
That 's a healthcare burden of about $ 25 per administration . ”
The Nanopatch is smaller than a postage stamp and is packed with thousands of tiny projections - invisible to the human eye - now dried to include the vaccine itself together with biocompatible excipients .
When the patch is placed against the skin , these projections push through the outer skin layer and deliver the biomolecules to the target cells .
When dry , the device is stable and strong .
When the Nanopatch is applied to the skin , the projections immediately become wet , dissolving within minutes .
Research published in journal Plos One in April found that the Nanopatch achieved a protective immune response using an unprecedented one - hundredth of the standard needle and syringe dose .
Professor Kendall said this was 10 times better than any other delivery method .
Being both painless and needle - free , the Nanopatch offers hope for those with needle phobia , as well as improving the vaccination experience for young children .
" When compared to a needle and syringe , a Nanopatch is cheap to produce and it is easy to imagine a situation in which a Government might provide vaccinations for a pandemic such as swine flu to be collected from a chemist or sent in the mail , ” Professor Kendall said .
He said the work had been in progress for five years and his team hoped to start clinical trials soon .
The study was conducted using influenza vaccine but Professor Kendall said any vaccine could potentially be delivered via the Nanopatch .
Also published in a separate paper in Small is research showing the Nanopatch 's success extends to candidate vaccines for West Nile virus and Chukunga virus .

MDMA , the drug commonly known as Ecstasy , may be beneficial in the treatment of post - traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) .
New research released this week suggests that MDMA , when used as an adjunct to psychotherapy , allowed patients with PTSD to more fully participate in therapy and achieve greater benefits from psychotherapy .
Dr. Michael C. Mithoefer , a psychiatrist and clinical researcher in private practice in South Carolina , working with colleagues at the Medical University of South Carolina and the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies in Santa Cruz found that when patients with severe PTSD were given MDMA in addition to intensive psychotherapy , they improved significantly more than patients who were given the same therapy along with a placebo .
MDMA ( ± 3 , 4 - methylphenylenedioxymethamphetamine ) has been illegal in the United States since 1985 , due to excessive recreational use , abuse , and concern that prolonged use may be psychologically and neurologically damaging .
Prior to 1985 , it was sometimes used as an adjunct to psychotherapy ; it was thought that MDMA could lower anxiety , reduce depression , increase a sense of intimacy , improve one ’s introspective ability , and facilitate communication .
Mithoefer and his colleagues enrolled 20 patients with severe PTSD , whose symptoms had not responded to traditional psychotherapy or medication .
12 patients were randomly assigned to a group that was given MDMA , and eight were given a placebo .
Neither the patients nor clinicians knew who was getting the active medication .
Each group underwent two 8 - hour psychotherapy sessions , an experimental PTSD treatment .
Both groups received psychotherapy before and after each session .
At the end of the trial , the placebo patients were offered opportunity to try the MDMA therapy as well .
To assess for changes in PTSD symptoms , all participants were tested using the Clinician - Administered PTSD Scale and neurocognitive testing , once at the beginning of the study , again 4 days after each 8 - hour session , and two months after the completion of the trial .
Of the participants who had MDMA - augmented psychotherapy , their PTSD symptoms were significantly reduced compared to those who had psychotherapy alone , as measured by the Clinician - Administered PTSD Scale. 10 of 12 ( 83 percent ) patients in the MDMA group had a reduction in symptoms , compared to 2 of 8 ( 25 percent ) .
Seven of the eight patients who initially received the placebo decided to try the MDMA treatment and all reported improvement .
Three subjects at the beginning of the study reported they were unable to work due to PTSD symptoms , but were working by the end of the study
The medication appeared to be well - tolerated , and no significant side effects were reported , specifically , no negative effects on neurocognition or blood pressure were seen .
PTSD is a serious condition , and is on the rise , particularly with an increasing number of soldiers returning from active combat .
One form of psychotherapy that can be effective is exposure therapy , where the patient , in a safe environment , is exposed to triggers of their trauma and fear .
It is thought that MDMA may enhance exposure therapy by allowing patients to break down emotional barriers and become more easily involved in the treatment , while at the same time making the therapy less painful and easier to tolerate .
“ MDMA - assisted psychotherapy can be administered to posttraumatic stress disorder patients without evidence of harm , and it may be useful in patients refractory to other treatments , ” writes Dr. Mithoefer .
It is important to note that MDMA is still illegal in the United States , and some research suggests that there may be serious long - term neurological and psychological conseqences from its abuse .
During this study , the use of MDMA was carefully monitored under close medical and psychological supervision , which Dr. Mithoefer emphasized was important for patient safety .
“ This method also involves patient preparation and close follow - up to support further processing of emotions and integration of cognitive shifts that may occur . ”
Dr. Mithoefer ’s results are published in the July 19th edition of the Journal of Psychopharmacology .

MDMA May Have Role in Treatment of PTSD
If you happen to spot a blue lobster that looks something like it came out of the hit cartoon ‘ The Smurfs ’ , consider yourself lucky !
This rare mutation in lobsters occurs with just one in 2 million lobsters .
Scientists believe that the reason behind the cobalt blue crustacean is a genetic defect that causes the lobster to produce an excessive amount of protein .
The combination of the protein and astaxanthin , an antioxidant in the food they eat , results in their shells favoring a blue pigment rather than the normal brownish color .
Unfortunately though , blue lobsters get eaten by predators fairly quickly , because of their unique color , making them all the more rare to find .
They would be better off with a bulls eye painted on them .
Some aquariums like the New England & Atlantis aquariums and SeaWorld at San Diego are said to a have resident blue lobsters that draw a lot of attention .
What ’s even rarer than the said Blue Lobsters that have an occurrence of only 1 in 30 million are yellow lobsters and Albino lobsters estimated at one in 100 million !

The principle of authority
The distinguishing characteristic of primitive peoples , according to Emile Durkheim , is the strength and rigidity of the conscience collective , the moral consensus of the community .
This collective consciousness is above and distinct from the consciousness of each individual member of the community , and it possesses an authoritative character by its connection to the social order .
The primitive man experiences the will of society as the will of a higher being , who he imagines to be God .
Justice in such societies is retributive ; it expresses the community ’s outrage over the violation of its norms .
For an atheist liberal , Professor Durkheim was quite perceptive .
It is quite true that the purpose of the state — any state , not just a primitive one — is to embody the conscience collective .
This is only to repeat Cicero ’s observation that a republic is distinguished from lesser forms of association by possessing a shared conception of justice .
A strong conscience collective can obviously be a powerful force for encouraging just behavior and discouraging unjust behavior .
However , the purpose of collective morality is not just to promote individual morality : public laws and standards have a positive moral value in themselves .
For example , suppose there were two cities in which the citizens were so peaceful that no murders ever took place in either one .
Now suppose that murder is prohibited by law in one polity but not the other .
The society which prohibits murder would be morally superior to the society which does n’t .
In both cities , each individual respects his neighbor ’s right to live , but only one citizenry collectively recognizes these rights .
In the other city , each individual may be morally upstanding , but their society is still morally deficient .
The opposite situation is more common : laws may have positive moral value even when they ca n’t be effectively enforced .
The function of government is to symbolize justice — to represent the community ’s moral consensus to itself — and to execute justice by punishing the wicked .
Of these two functions , it is government ’s symbolic role which is the more important .
It is the ability to symbolize justice that gives the state its authority over its subjects .
This is the meaning of the scholastic doctrine that government derives its authority from being “ established ” .
The very fact that , through whatever series of historical accidents , a people has come to see a governing body as the representative of justice suffices to give that body real moral authority .
The source of the state ’s authority is in the minds of its subjects .
It is , however , in their intellects , not in their wills .
The state ’s authority has nothing to do with anybody ’s consent ; a man might wish he did n’t have to obey his government while still recognizing its legitimacy .
Moreover , we should not think that a people first exists and then decides on a principle of legitimacy ( a constitution ) .
It is such a principle which makes a people to be one people and not a mere aggregate .
So , for example , there is a French people , but there is no united “ Caucasian people ” or “ people of western Illinois ” .
Caucasians are found among many people , and western Illinoisans recognize no authority which is not also recognized by eastern Illinoisans .
Also , it ’s not true that Americans created their principle of legitimacy at the Constitutional Convention .
The procedural rules which we call the U.S. “ Constitution ” draw their authority from America ’s prior sense of legitimacy .
The “ Constitution ” had to be ratified by the thirteen states , whose authority was taken as given , and the delegates of the Convention never imagined questioning that the United States comprised these and ( at the time ) only these states .
How often do you find yourself in the following situation ?
-d
print debugging output
Having written a nice little program , you just want to add one little command line option .
Typical example :.
So all you want to say ( in code ) is something like this :
If we were given the ' - d ' flag on the command line , ... [ print / enable debug output ]
But what you actually have to do is usually this :
Get a hold of your favourite getopt library .
If it 's not a standard library , make sure to note that dependency somewhere !
library .
If it 's not a standard library , make sure to note that dependency somewhere !
Find the documentation and look up basic usage .
Specify to the library exactly which options you want to accept , whether they take any arguments , and provide a usage note for the autogenerated help text .
Make a loop in your main routine for parsing all options .
routine for .
Finally , in that loop , state that -d enables debugging output .
Seem a bit much ?
Not that there is anything wrong with the above in principle .
These libraries are very useful for writing compilers and faithful reproductions of historic UNIX utilities .
But for your everyday script ?
I think it 's annoying .
So , speaking of returns to simplicity .
These are for pasting into your next Haskell script :
import System .
Environment -- pesco's really cheap and simple flags and options ( tm ) clparts = getArgs >>= return .
( \ ( a , b ) -> ( a , drop 1 b ) ) . break ( == " -- " ) getargs = clparts >>= \( a , b ) -> return ( [ h :t| h:t < - a , h/= ' -' || null t ] ++ b ) getflags = clparts >>= \ ( a , _ ) -> return ( concat [ t| '-':t <- a ] ) getflag x = getflags >>= return .
elem x getenv f v x = catch ( getEnv v >>= return . f ) ( \_ -> return x )
Here , have some type signatures , too :
getargs :: IO [ String ] getflags :: IO [ Char ] getflag :: Char -> IO Bool getenv :: ( String -> a ) -> String -> a ->
IO a
Usage of the functions is pretty apparent from the types .
Do n't look anything up .
Please !
From five lines you get :
Boolean flags :
Anywhere in your ( IO ) code , ask whether a certain flag has been specified : d <- getflag ' d ' when d $ putStrLn " debug on ! "
Alternatively , get the list of flags once and pass it around .
flags <- getflags when all ( `elem` flags ) " nlp " $ putStrLn " my favourite options ! "
: Anywhere in your ( ) code , ask whether a certain flag has been specified :
Alternatively , get the list of flags once and pass it around .
Condensed flags :
Throw any number of flag characters behind a single dash - : $ myps - aux
: Throw any number of flag characters behind a single dash : Options with defaults :
This might feel strange , but seriously : Use environment variables .
To query , complete with reader / parser and default value : n <- getenv read " n " 10 -- think " tail - n " c <- getenv read " C " 0 -- think " grep - C " -- default comes in from another IO action today <- getenv parsedate " today " =<< getcurdate -- cascading defaults plan <- getenv id " PLAN " =<< getenv (++ " /.plan " ) " HOME " =<< return " -" BTW , do n't think that setting an env var is more work than a command line argument !
Compare : $ today =2010-07 -26 watnu vs. $ watnu -- today=2010-07-26
The so - called keyword parameter syntax of the former has been supported since the original Bourne Shell .
: This might feel strange , but seriously : Use environment variables .

Compare : vs . The so - called syntax of the former has been supported since the original Bourne Shell .
Retrieve any non-flag arguments via the getargs routine .
via the routine .
Arguments that begin with a dash : Anything after an argument of -- is not a flag .
A single dash - is also not a flag .
You buy simplicity at the expense of comprehensiveness .
What you do n't get :
Long flags ( e.g. -- debug ) .
You have 52 latin letters ( upper - and lower - case ) available .
Plus any digits and special characters you can sensibly make use of .
When you need more , use a real command line option parser .
You 're writing a goddamn compiler or something .

Autogenerated help and usage messages .
Type them yourself , they 're going to be so much prettier .
Come on , add some ASCII art .
When it really is too bothersome , feel free to define the following function : helpscreen :: String -- textual command description -> [ ( Char , String ) ] -- recognized flags with desc . -> [ ( String , String ) ] -- recognized env vars with desc . ->
String

Come on , add some ASCII art .
When it really is too bothersome , feel free to define the following function : Elaborate error messages .
Obviously there 's nothing like command line option -- foo requires Frob argument , but got Twizzle in those five lines .
Then again , nothing is to stop you from putting arbitrarily complicated error checking in the reader you pass to getenv or validate the order and number of things in the result of getflags , etc . .

I did make an elaborate command line parsing library a few years ago .
Suitable for building big compilers and stuff !
You might still find it in the caches of the intarweb if you 're interested .
Reading the original abstract , the goal was similar then :
Make it really easy to get command line options into programs .
Alas , using that library still suffered from problems outlined at the top of this post :
Find it , look through the docs , add a big bunch of code to your project , use an elaborate API .
I think it was a very good replacement for the standard ; considerably nicer , with many fancy features .
But probably overkill for everyday use in scripts or small programs .
DETROIT -- Patrick Eaves resurrected his career last season with the Detroit Red Wings , contributing his fair share of offense ( 12 goals ) and helping to solidify the penalty killing with his willingness to block shots .
The Red Wings hope to see more of the same after signing Eaves on Wednesday to a one - year contract for $ 750,000 .
" Special teams are critical , '' Red Wings general manager Ken Holland said .
" We had a tough time keeping the puck out of our net a couple of years ago ( on the penalty kill ) .
He took a lot of pride in blocking shots .
Getting in shooting lanes shows a lot of intestinal fortitude . ''
Eaves , a 2003 first - round draft pick of the Ottawa Senators , was bought out of his contract by the Boston Bruins last summer right after they acquired him from the Carolina Hurricanes .
" Early on , he looked like the odd - man out , but because of injuries he got an opportunity and took full advantage of it , '' Holland said .
" Some nights , the Eaves - ( Darren ) Hem -( Kris ) Draper line was our best line , brought a lot of speed and energy . ''
Eaves , 26 , has some offensive upside .
He scored 20 goals for the Senators as a rookie in 2005 - 06 and has a tremendous wrist shot .
But he is n't likely to get the same opportunity of playing on the third line if the team remains relatively healthy .
He will play more of a grinding role on the fourth line .
The Red Wings have 20 players signed for a salary - cap hit of $ 55.7 million .
The cap is $ 59.4 million .
Factoring in the $ 500,000 cushion Holland intends to keep in case of short - term injuries , the Red Wings have about $ 3.2 million to spend .
They will re-sign restricted free agents Darren Helm , Justin Abdelkader and Derek Meech , the latter of whom likely will be traded or waived before the start of the regular season unless the club is short on defensemen .
The team also remains in hot pursuit of center Mike Modano , who probably wo n't wait too long to decide if he wants to sign with the Red Wings or retire .
Signing Modano would give the club 15 forwards who are not exempt from waivers .
One likely will be traded or waived , but probably not until after the preseason , creating competition in training camp .
Teams can be as much as 10 percent over the salary cap until the start of the regular season .
" Jews in at least six Amsterdam neighbourhoods often cannot cross the street wearing a skullcap without being insulted , spat at or even attacked , " according to local reports .
The random designer trying to claim 84 percent of Facebook might have CEO Mark Zuckerberg 's signature on a contract giving him the ownership stake .
Facebook 's courtroom admissions are making Paul Ceglia 's claim sound a lot less insane .
The Western New York man still has to explain why Zuckerberg would effectively sign away his social network months before he is said to have invented it in his Harvard dorm room .
But his lawyers did get Facebook counsel Lisa Simpson to admit : 1 ) that Zuckerberg had a contract of some sort with the Web designer ; and 2 ) that Facebook is " unsure " of whether its CEO signed the specific contract that hands over much of his Facebook equity .
Both sides accept that Zuckerberg agreed to do some Web development for another project Ceglia was working on .
What 's up for dispute is if the money was also intended as an investment in Facebook .
Facebook is trying to say it 's too late to sue over the contract because the statute of limitations has expired .
Unless the company can cobble together a better picture of what agreements its founder did or did not enter into , that 's probably the best approach .

Facebook 's Assets Frozen Over Insane Legal Claim

The road to running a 100 % Linux shop started for yours truly last year when I dumped my MacBook for a cheap and cheerful Eee PC ; it proved itself worthy of world travel during Nokia ’s N97 24/7 tour .
The next piece in the puzzle was my wireless router — a ridiculously - overpriced AirPort Base Station and Express that were handily replaced by a FONERA 2.0N over Christmas .
Next up was freeing my music from the clutches of iTunes .
All that remained was the computer itself .
I first saw the Lenovo A600 in Singapore last November and wanted it , badly .
And when I saw that my local Tiger Direct had an insanely cheap open box deal I knew it could be mine !
So what justifies sending a $ 4,000 Mac to the curb and replacing it with a $ 750 all - in - one ?
Two things :
1. Like any other power user I loaded up my Mac Pro with as many internal hard drives as it could stand ( in this case 4 ) .
And like any other Mac user I initialized the extra hard drives in Apple ’s HFS + format — not realizing that it was proprietary to the point of being unreadable by a Linux - powered computer .
Because I need to move my data off of the drives to reformat them I now have the opportunity to house them in a separate RAID enclosure .
This made an all - in - one a viable contender .
2 . Anyone cursed with a Mac tower will know exactly what I mean when I say this : Mac towers are LOUD .
So loud that I can hear the screaming fans of my Mac Pro from the other side of my two - bedroom condo .
From the moment I power it up in the morning the fans kick in and wail all day long .
At best they wheeze like an old man in his sleep ; at worst they are so loud that I cannot effectively have a conversation on the telephone while sitting at my Mac .
Even with a headset .
My Lenovo , on the other hand , emits a quick grunt on start - up as it checks for the presence of a disc in the slot - loading drive , and is never heard from again .
Currently it ’s running Linux Mint , with an eye towards taking the new Ubuntu for a spin when the release version drops later this month .
I ’ve owned Macs since 1995 — 8 of them , to be exact .
And the saying that “ Macs just work ” ?
That has n’t exactly been my experience :
iMac DVSE ( 1999 ) – needed new motherboard out of the box ;
iBook 2nd - gen ( 2001 ) – needed new speakers out of the box ;
G5 Tower ( 2003 ) – needed new motherboard out of the box ;
PowerBook ( 2003 ) – needed new screen out of box .
Meanwhile the Lenovo laptop I bought in 2006 is still tucked away in a closet in case I ever need ( ugh ) Windows for some specific task .
And really , my only complaint with the A600 thus far is all the Microsoft stickers on it … 😉
HUMAN intelligence is puzzling .
It is higher , on average , in some places than in others .
And it seems to have been rising in recent decades .
Why these two things should be true is controversial .
This week , though , a group of researchers at the University of New Mexico propose the same explanation for both : the effect of infectious disease .
If they are right , it suggests that the control of such diseases is crucial to a country 's development in a way that had not been appreciated before .
Places that harbour a lot of parasites and pathogens not only suffer the debilitating effects of disease on their workforces , but also have their human capital eroded , child by child , from birth .
Christopher Eppig and his colleagues make their suggestion in the Proceedings of the Royal Society .
They note that the brains of newly born children require 87 % of those children 's metabolic energy .
In five - year - olds the figure is still 44 % and even in adults the brain — a mere 2 % of the body 's weight — consumes about a quarter of the body 's energy .
Any competition for this energy is likely to damage the brain 's development , and parasites and pathogens compete for it in several ways .
Some feed on the host 's tissue directly , or hijack its molecular machinery to reproduce .
Some , particularly those that live in the gut , stop their host absorbing food .
And all provoke the host 's immune system into activity , which diverts resources from other things .
The inverse correlation that the group calculated between a country 's disease burden and the average intelligence of its people is impressive .
They estimated the disease burden from World Health Organisation data on DALYs ( disability - adjusted life years ) lost caused by 28 infectious diseases .
These data exist for 192 countries .
The intelligence scores came from work carried out earlier this decade by Richard Lynn , a British psychologist , and Tatu Vanhanen , a Finnish political scientist , who analysed IQ studies from 113 countries , and from subsequent work by Jelte Wicherts , a Dutch psychologist .
At the bottom of the average - intelligence list is Equatorial Guinea , followed by St Lucia .
Cameroon , Mozambique and Gabon tie at third from bottom .
These countries also have among the highest burden of infectious diseases .
At the top of the list of countries with the highest average intelligence is Singapore , followed by South Korea .
China and Japan tie in third place .
These countries all have relatively low levels of disease .
America , Britain and a number of European countries , follow behind the leaders .
A list of the countries included in the study can be found here .
The consequence of illness
The correlation is about 67 % , and the chance that it might have come about at random is less than one in 10,000 .
But correlation is not causation , so Mr Eppig and his colleagues tried to eliminate other possible explanations .
Previous work has offered income , education , low levels of agricultural labour ( which is replaced by more mentally stimulating jobs ) , climate ( the challenge of surviving cold weather might provoke the evolution of intelligence ) and even distance from humanity 's African homeland ( novel environments could encourage greater intelligence ) as explanations for national differences in IQ .
However , all of these , except perhaps the last , are also likely to be linked to disease and , by careful statistical analysis , Mr Eppig and his colleagues show that all of them either disappear or are reduced to a small effect when the consequences of disease are taken into account .
There is , moreover , direct evidence that infections and parasites affect cognition .
Intestinal worms have been shown to do so on many occasions .
Malaria , too , is bad for the brain .
A study of children in Kenya who survived the cerebral version of the disease suggests that an eighth of them suffer long - term cognitive damage .
In the view of Mr Eppig and his colleagues , however , it is the various bugs that cause diarrhoea which are the biggest threat .
Diarrhoea strikes children hard .
It accounts for a sixth of infant deaths , and even in those it does not kill it prevents the absorption of food at a time when the brain is growing and developing rapidly .
The researchers predict that one type of health problem will increase with rising intelligence .
Asthma and other allergies are thought by many experts to be rising in frequency because infantile immune systems , unchallenged by infection , are turning against the cells of the body they are supposed to protect .
Some studies already suggest a correlation between a country 's allergy levels and its average IQ .
Mr Eppig and his colleagues predict that future work will confirm this relationship .
The other prediction , of course , is that as countries conquer disease , the intelligence of their citizens will rise .
A rise in intelligence over the decades has already been noticed in rich countries .
It is called the Flynn effect after James Flynn , who discovered it .
Its cause , however , has been mysterious — until now .
If Mr Eppig is right , the near - abolition of serious infections in these countries , by vaccination , clean water and proper sewerage , may explain much if not all of the Flynn effect .
When Dr Lynn and Dr Vanhanen originally published their IQ data , they used them to advance the theory that national differences in intelligence were the main reason for different levels of economic development .
This study turns that reasoning on its head .
It is lack of development , and the many health problems this brings , which explains the difference in levels of intelligence .
No doubt , in a vicious circle , those differences help keep poor countries poor .
But the new theory offers a way to break the circle .
If further work by researchers supports the ideas of Mr Eppig and his colleagues , they will have done the world a good turn by providing policymakers with yet another reason why the elimination of disease should be one of the main aims of development , rather than a desirable afterthought .

Sage argues that titles still retain powerful and bemusing stereotypes
My first ever experience of the ‘ alternative ’ female title ‘ Ms ’ was in the early part of secondary school .
It was widely speculated that my yoga and art teacher was a lesbian .
At a parents evening , a father asked why her title was ‘ Ms’ , to which she allegedly responded that it stood for ‘ Mr’. Quite what really happened , we ’ll never know , but from that day I learnt that ‘ Ms ’ stood for ‘ lesbian ’ .
Incidentally , it was only when I was in my first lesbian relationship that I began to question my status as little Miss .
It was only after I became what my mother would describe as militant that I started to correct everyone who assumed my title was Miss .
The longest saga has been with my bank .
Ever since I opened my account and my personal banker automatically put Miss , I have been trying to change it to my correct title , Ms . The request to change my title is always met with a sigh , rolled eyes and a slightly cooled atmosphere .
“ Does it really matter , Miss Picky ? ”
Well , yes .
“ Are you divorced , Miss Single ? ”
Well , no .
For a long time , I used to try and belittle the importance to me , and would say it did n’t matter , that it was only silly , and a purely aesthetic change .
I would undermine my own feminism , to avoid feeling awkward and avoid being associated with what I then considered to be a negative stereotype .
I did n’t want them to think that I had hairy legs , or lived on a diet of mung - bean stew .
Strangely most of all , I did n’t want them to think I was some sort of lesbian .
Not that I have ever had an issue with being ‘ out ’ , but because I did n’t want to conform to what they thought a Ms should be like .
The issue does not relate to my disdain for body hair or mung - beans , as both play an important part in my life .
It ’s because these things are n’t the reasons why I am a Ms .
In fact , they bear no relation whatsoever .
I ’m a Ms because I refuse to be defined by my relationship to a man .
Or a woman as it happens .
Some people may argue that titles are antiquated in themselves , that it should be irrelevant whether you are a Mr or Ms. I empathise with that sentiment very much , and feel acutely aware of the detriment of gender binary attitudes .
Part of me would rather remove the title system altogether .
My issue is , I am extraordinarily proud of being a woman .
Being female is an important part of my identity .
I want to be Ms Independent .
It is widely thought that Ms was thought up in the US in the 1970s , as a brainchild of the feminist movement .
However a little research indicates that it occurs in documents from as early as the 1700s .
To modern sensibilities , defining a woman as ‘ The Mistress of Husband ’ or ‘ The Mistress of Father ’ does seem a little strange .
For many husbands , a wife ’s rejection of ‘ Mrs ’ or the male surname feel like a slight against his family – the actions of Ms Awkward .
My father died a few years ago , but I ’m fairly sure he would balk at the suggestion that I belong to him until some innocent man was absent - minded enough to shack up with me .
As it stands , I ’m not entirely sure I want to be defined as a possession of a dead man .
As much as I love him , it ’s very strange indeed .
When I have corrected important documents at work with my correct title , I have been made to feel petty , insecure and unnecessarily political
Aside from the patriarchal ‘ ownership ’ chestnut , I do n’t want to be a Miss anymore .
Much to my dismay , I think I am a grown - up now .
‘ Miss ’ brings with it a whole host of connotations that I would rather not be attached to .
It implies weakness , subservience , inferiority , incompleteness .
If I was going to carelessly wield stereotypes around I would say that I would much rather be the scary , hairy Ms Muff - Muncher than Little Miss Training Bra .
My indignation to ditch Little Miss Victim has left me with a bitter taste in my mouth .
I feel an overwhelming sense of shame for giving a shit about what anyone thinks .
So what if someone thinks I am a young , unmarried woman – last time I checked , I was ?
Have I just got ants in my pants about being a young , single female in a male - dominated working world ?
Is this just my special little way of demonstrating my super - strength of character in this strange rat race ?
The answer to the above questions is , most probably , yes .
But being a Ms is not necessarily the easy choice .
While reading around the topic , I came across studies that suggested that people are less likely to trust women with the title Ms .
This was n’t about lentils , leg hair or lady - loving … it ’s about rebellion .
It seems that for some people , I make an overt , daily statement about my rejection of ( a patriarchal ) status quo .
When I have corrected important documents at work with my correct title , I have been made to feel petty , insecure and unnecessarily political .
I am sure this is a very typical example of how many people try to squeeze these little acts of feminism out of young women .
Over the last few years , I ’ve have grown ever confident in my response to those who try define my title for me .
Sexuality , fashion and diet aside – I am a Ms because I belong to me .
Nowadays , I take great pleasure in the fact that every time I write my name , I am reminded of how far women have come – and how far we still have to go .

The time has come to take off our hats to the prime minister .
Benjamin Netanyahu 's predictions have proved accurate , and his prophecies are coming true right before our eyes .
Now we can proudly declare that our government is led by a man of vision , a statesman who has foretold the future .
Even his greatest critics can't deny it ; the facts speak for themselves .
Open gallery view PM Benjamin Netanyahu gives a statement of Israel 's raid on a Gaza aid convoy , June 2 , 2010 Credit : Getty
Netanyahu said the whole world is against us .
Was n't he right ?
He also said we live under an existential threat .
Is n't it beginning to look like that ?
Give it another minute and Turkey will be at war with us too .
Netanyahu said there 's no chance of reaching an agreement with the Arabs .
Was n't that spot on ?
Our prime minister , who saw danger lurking in every alleyway and enemies waiting around every corner , who has always taught that there is no hope , who has drummed into us that we shall forever live by the sword ( just as his father the historian taught him ) , knew what he was talking about .
We have n't had anyone like him since David Ben-Gurion .
He 's a genuine prophet whose every prediction comes true , one after the other - someone who can really be proud of his accomplishments .
Enough mockery , enough ridicule .
For Netanyahu is not only a prophet ; his leadership has swept up the entire country .
There is no longer anyone who can stop him from realizing his vision , and soon the pundits will be writing that Netanyahu was right .
This country now has a blind captain in the cockpit , flying his blindfolded passengers with exemplary precision toward the destination he envisioned .
If there had still been any object of his scaremongering that had not yet been attained before this week , along came the outrageous seizure of the flotilla , and that goal too was in the bag .
If anyone was still entertaining a glimmer of hope that our pilot was n't totally blind , that he had some special sight - enhancing gadget , along came his declaration that the blockade of Gaza would continue .
Let the world and wisdom and Gaza all go to hell , and incidentally Israel too - and dash that glimmer of hope as well .
After the saws and knives seized on the Marmara have been publicly exhibited , we will be able to convince ourselves once and for all that there is indeed a danger lurking in every alley , an Al - Qaida operative on every ship , weapons on every deck - and even that the Marmara was an existential threat , no less , just as our leader had foreseen .
Of course , no one will demand to see the guns that the activists are alleged to have fired , or the video footage in which Israeli soldiers are seen firing , or the confiscated photographs taken by journalists .
For us , the pictures of the severe beatings that the IDF Spokesman 's Office has released are enough .
Some 7 billion human beings ( less about 5 million Israeli Jews ) are wrong .
They have n't got a leader like Netanyahu , and that 's why they go on thinking that seizing passenger ships in international waters is an act of piracy , no different from the deeds committed by the pirates of Somalia .
They think ( wrongly of course ) that Israel has no right to stop a fleet of boats ; that the victims are the people of Gaza and the bleeding passengers , not the naval commandos who raided the ship and were beaten ; and that the aggressors were the troops who were dropped onto the ship from a helicopter , killing nine civilians with live fire and wounding dozens .
The world is wrong and Netanyahu , with us in tow , is right .
We will not lift the blockade .
For four years it has yielded not an ounce of benefit , just damage , but what does that matter ?
Giddyup !
Let 's fulfill Netanyahu 's vision .
We 'll become an even more despised country and wo n't have a single friend left in the world , not even the United States .
True , it was Netanyahu 's predecessor , Ehud Olmert , who began this terrible landslide with Operation Cast Lead , after which the world became intolerant of all violent behavior by Israel , but Netanyahu is following in his path .
Despite it all , his vision has not yet been realized in full .
He gave rise to one hope : an " economic peace " that would bring prosperity to Palestinians and Israelis .
But as yet there has been no greater saboteur of Israeli exports than Netanyahu , and soon everything produced here will have to be sold no further afield than Petah Tikva .
Even prophets are entitled to err on occasion , but he had better not give rise to any more hopes .
About half of Israelis want a commission of inquiry , according to a poll published yesterday .
It can be assumed that this is only because our soldiers were beaten and humiliated .
Why , what else is there to investigate ?
After all , we have a prophet - statesman whose predictions are coming true , one after the other , and the redeemer is ( not ) coming to Zion .

G20 protests in Toronto : an aftermath
This is a graph presenting aspects of the G20 protests in Toronto during the weekend of 26 & 27 June , 2010 .
The security costs are compared with those of other , past G20 / G8 summits .
While it must have cost about 1 billion Canadian dollars ( about 938 million US $ ) for the security of both G8 and G20 summits in Canada in 2010 , the costs were significantly less for past summits :
in Japan it was 381 million US $ in 2008 for the G8 summit , while for the London G20 summit in 2009 the cost was 30 million .
There is also a representation of the forces deployed for security : 19,000 police officers from all over Canada and 1,100 private security guards .
The graph focuses on the events / demonstrations during the weekend ( 26 & 27 June 2010 ) .
The number of security forces is compared to the number of the protesters .
While the National Post ( Canadian newspaper ) claims that the protesters were about 10,000 , the Guardian ( London , UK ) brings this number down to 5,000 ( the Guardian suggests that although about 10,000 were planning to demonstrate only about 5,000 made it due to poor weather conditions ; i.e. rain ) .
On the other hand there were about 5,500 police officers .
Finally , a time line shows the number of protesters arrested and charged during the demonstrations : more than 600 according to the Montreal Gazette or more than 900 people according to CBC news .
Many thanks to Jennifer Hollett for suggesting and inspiring me to develop and design this graph .

Since early February , over 1,100 communities have applied to be part of Google 's experimental 1 Gbps , open - access , fiber - to - the - home Internet service , including applicants who have promised to change the name of their town to Google ( temporarily ) , name their expected twins after Google 's co-founders ( if they 're boys ) , or train their puppy to bark " Google " ( sort of ) every time the phrase " high speed Internet " is mentioned .
But while the search engine giant has yet to decide which of these applicants will win the 1 Gbps prize , the company is trying to enroll all of them , and everybody else , in what amounts to an advocacy campaign " for common - sense federal and local policies that would help fiber deployments nationwide . "
All the details will show up on Google 's new fiber - for - communities website , which will update the public on the project , and comes complete with a " thank you " YouTube video for all the fiber hopefuls — including the mayor who swam in a shark tank " to show his dedication to our cities ' pursuit of Google fiber . "
The key components of this campaign include showing support for bills in the House and Senate that would require all new federally funded construction projects to include broadband conduit — plastic pipe that can house fiber - optic communications cable .
Google also wants cities to establish the same policies for construction projects that involve street work .
" We 'd like every city and community that shares our interest in expanding the speed of the Internet to make conduit installation an integral part of their own road construction / repair process , " Google says .
" We encourage local governments to take concrete action on this and complete the dream of ultra high - speed Internet in their own towns . "
The company emphasizes that participation in this campaign is n't going to get any of those 1,100 city applicants special consideration when it comes to picking testbed winners , but we 're betting that more than a few aldermen , supervisors , and city council members in those fair towns are now thinking about conduit ordinances , if they have n't already .

The case famously saw Goldman 's chief executive , Lloyd Blankfein , grilled by Congress in April
US bank Goldman Sachs has agreed to pay $ 550 m ( £ 356 m ) to settle civil fraud charges of misleading investors .
The charges concerned Goldman 's marketing of mortgage investments as the US housing market faltered .
US finance watchdog the Securities and Exchange Commission said it was the biggest fine for a bank in its history .
The UK's Royal Bank of Scotland , which is now 84 % owned by the UK taxpayer and lost about $ 840 m in investments , will receive $ 100 m compensation .
RBS has indicated that it may sue Goldman for the rest of the money it lost , saying that it would " carefully consider all of its options " .
German bank IKB Deutsche Industriebank will receive $ 150 m of the SEC fine , meaning it will recoup all of its losses on the Abacus deal that was the subject of the SEC 's investigation .
This is despite the fact that RBS 's investment in Abacus actually ranked senior to IKB 's investment - meaning that RBS 's investment was supposed to be safer .
Some will argue that Goldman Sachs got off lightly Robert Peston , BBC business editor Read Robert 's blog
The remaining $ 300 m will go to the US Treasury .
Terms of the settlement are subject to approval by a federal judge .
Misguided investors
The SEC said Goldman had acknowledged that marketing material contained " incomplete information " .
In a statement , Goldman did not admit legal wrongdoing but said the move was " the right outcome for our firm , our shareholders and our clients " .
Despite the record fine , Goldman shares rose by 4.5 % , reflecting the fact that many analysts felt the firm had got off lightly .
" They pay $ 550 million and they get an $ 800 million pop in their stock price ... they got off easy , " said Kevin Caron at Stifel , Nicolaus & Co .
Goldman made a profit of $ 3.5 bn in the first three months of this year .
Housing collapse
In April , the SEC charged Goldman with failing to disclose " vital information " that one of its clients , Paulson & Co , helped to choose which securities were packaged into a mortgage portfolio that was then sold to investors in 2007 .
It claimed Goldman did not disclose that Paulson , one of the world 's largest hedge funds , had bet that the value of the securities would fall .
The SEC alleged that investors in the mortgage securities , packaged into a vehicle called Abacus , lost more than $ 1bn ( £ 650 m ) in the US housing market collapse .
All of that $ 1bn was then paid out to Paulson , who - unknown to the investors - stood on the other side of the deal as a " short " investor in the deal .
Anger
Goldman , arguably the world 's most prestigious investment bank , had escaped relatively unscathed from the global financial meltdown .
Since then , the company has become a lightning rod for anger over Wall Street 's profligacy and seeming arrogance .
It received $ 10bn of government aid under the Troubled Asset Relief Program ( Tarp ) in 2008 - money that Goldman has said throughout that it did not need .
The company also received a $ 12.9 bn cash payout from AIG - the full amount owed to it - after the failing insurer was saved by the US government in by far the most expensive single bail - out of the financial crisis .
Despite these rescues , Goldman went on to record $ 12.2 bn in profits in 2009 , on top of the $ 16.2 bn handed out to staff in pay and perks .
Associated Press Louis
Gray just wrote an interesting post about how he kicked iPhones out of his life and went with Android .
I could write that post too .
After all , I agree with it in principle , even if I ca n’t take the step and cross over the iPhone / Android barrier .
He is n’t the first , either , to advocate giving up your iPhone and going with one running Google ’s Android OS .
Leo Laporte told me the same thing at FooCamp ( Tim O’Reilly ’s campout where he invites a few hundred geeks for a weekend campout at O’Reilly ’s headquarters ) .
Although Leo was holding an iPhone he told me he is kicking the iPhone habit and going Android .
On vacation I had dinner with Brett Schulte , who is an IT consultant for celebrities .
He ’s the one who got me on the set of Criminal Minds and is one of those few influencers that companies try to get to push their products onto sets and into actors ’ hands .
He ’s kicked the iPhone to the curb for the same reasons Louis gave .
And I do try .
I ’ve had three Android - based phones in my hands in the past nine months : a Droid , a Nexus One , and a Sprint EVO .
I ’ve also tried a Verizon Incredible and a Hero .
All of these phones have some magical features , to be sure .
I loved having the EVO be a wifi hotspot .
I like some of the apps better on Android , in particular , Google Voice , Google Maps , and Google Buzz .
All are way better than anything on the iPhone .
But still I ca n’t kick the iPhone habit .
Why not ?
1. I ’m more productive on the iPhone .
You might say I did n’t give Android enough of a shot .
But I completely stopped using the iPhone for two weeks to see if I could get my Android skills up .
I still was faster and more comfortable with using the iPhone .
More on why in a second .
2 . The hardware is simply superior .
Even with the weird antenna issue I just like the way iPhones are built .
They feel better in my hands and that ’s important to me since I use these devices SO MUCH during my day .
The screen on the iPhone 4 is simply superior to anything Android has today .
Leo told me “ wait until you see the Samsung . ”
Well , OK , but the Samsung is n’t out yet .
When it is I ’ll try it out and see if that gets me to kick my iPhone habit .
3a . Apps on iPhone are way better quality .
Sorry , but the apps I count on , things like the Twitter app , the Facebook app , the camera / photography / video apps , location apps , etc are almost wholly superior on iPhone than on Android .
3b . More app choices on iPhone , especially in games .
I keep finding world - class games on iPhone that have n’t been ported yet to Android .
I should make a list .
4 . I hate AT&T ’s quality , but I do n’t hate it enough to leave .
I did n’t really understand that , but then I started keeping track of how often I use voice .
On my phone I only use voice about 5 % of the time I use my iPhone .
Almost all the rest of the time I ’m using it for Twitter , to read news , to interact with apps , to play games , to Facetime with my sons / wife , etc .
In non-voice parts of using the iPhone AT&T ’s lack of quality of service does n’t matter at all .
Most of the time I ’m doing those kinds of things I ’m on wifi anyway .
To gain better voice quality , which I only use about 5 % of the time , I ’d have to give up a better experience on the web and in apps , which just is n’t acceptable to me .
5 . Apple users tend to use more apps .
I ’ve been asking my friends who have Android apps how many apps they have .
The average , so far , is about half of the apps that my iPhone - using friends have .
Also , something else I noticed , when comparing experiences with SlideShare ’s CTO , Jonathan Boutelle , was that we both noticed that Android users have n’t purchased many apps yet .
That is something I ’m hearing from app developers , too , which explains why the best developers put most of their time into the Apple platform and are n’t working as hard on the Android .
But to me this is a bummer because the way I discover new apps is to talk to people .
In airports you ’ll see me stalking iPhone users asking them what their favorite apps are , or online you ’ll see me searching through Appsfire.com for new apps .
Is there an Appsfire for Android ?
My point exactly .
There is a network effect with apps and Android has n’t gotten there yet .
Will they ?
I ’m sure they will , Google seems to have the same advantages that Microsoft had in earlier platform battles with Apple , but TODAY Google has n’t come close and that means I ca n’t kick my iPhone habit .
6. Battery life .
My Android phones totally suck when compared to the iPhone 4 .
My son literally texted with friends all day while at Disneyland ( nothing like a teenager obsessed with texting ) .
At 11 p.m. he still had 36 % battery left on his iPhone 4 and I had 50 % left , even after using it a lot as a camera taking video and photos of the family and checking into Twitter after an earthquake closed down a lot of the rides there .
My Android - based phones do n’t come close .
My Sprint EVO used 40 % of its battery on ONE one - hour phone call .
Louis says he gets pretty good battery life , but then I started asking him what he did with his phone to get that and he turned a lot of stuff off that came on by default .
I did n’t have to do that on our iPhones .
7. Camera features and aspirational advertising .
You know , I ’ve had tons of Nokia phones with two cameras .
I ’ve never used them as much as I ’ve used the one in my iPhone .
Why ?
Affordances .
My iPhone affords using these features .
It is easy , and when someone calls me I can see if they can use Facetime with me .
Plus , their advertising is aspirational and gets my friends to WANT to try these new features out .
I ’ve never had someone get a new Nokia phone , call me , and beg me to try out a new feature .
I ’ve gotten DOZENS of those kinds of calls in the past three weeks .
So , why am I more productive on iPhones than on Android ?
It came down to small things that I ’ve noticed .
For one , each app works more consistently .
On Seesmic on Android , for instance , I could scroll to the top of its window by clicking a red bar .
On every iPhone app that happens by clicking the top bar .
On EVERY app .
On Android it is n’t in the same place , or with the same command .
When I want to edit text , I just click and the cursor on the iPhone enters the place where I clicked .
On the Android it does n’t work as consistently .
Partly because some of the screens are n’t as sensitive as the iPhones , but partly if you click too long a dialog box asking if you ’d like to copy text comes up .
Grrr .
On other things , when I double - click columns of text the iPhone works how I expect it to : the text zooms to fill the maximum width of the screen .
On Android it often would overzoom so now I ’d have to scroll around to read .
Add in the extra readability of the new screen and this is maddening , but is a little thing very few people would notice .
I ’m sure lots of people will argue with me and tell me how the Android is already superior in all of these cases .
They probably are correct : for them .
But I ’ve tried it out and continue doing so ( I keep my Verizon account and Motorola Droid and I keep playing with it just to see if I can kick the iPhone habit ) and for me I ’m still addicted to the iPhone .
When that addiction ends , you ’ll be the first to know since I ’m in agreement that Google is the company I ’d rather be in bed with than Apple but for now I just ca n’t kick the Apple habit and I ’m very happy with giving Steve Jobs more of my money because Apple definitely has built the best mobile device on the market today .
Tomorrow ?
We ’ll see .
How about you ?
Have you kicked your iPhone habit ?

By Ben Courtice
June 28 , 2010 --
In their article " World People 's Conference on Climate Change : Some critical comments on the People 's Agreement " , the Fourth International 's Daniel Tanuro and Sandra Invernizzi have missed the main usefulness of this document .
They note , “ The words `coal ' and `natural gas ' are simply not mentioned .
The expression `renewable energies ' is also absent ” and that the document “ overlooks the struggle against the capitalist energy lobbies and the sectors linked to it ( cars , petrochemicals , shipbuilding , the aeronautics industry , transport … ) , whereas this is obviously the key question in the framework of an anti-capitalist strategy of stabilisation of the climate . ”
It is true the conference did not target the hydrocarbon industries .
The Bolivian hydrocarbon ministry in fact had a stall at the conference .
The conference was very Bolivian : 26,000 out of 35,000 participants were from Bolivia .
It is true that it reflected many of the weaknesses and strengths of the Bolivian government and movement , but Tanuro and Invernizzi overestimate the weaknesses relative to the strengths .
Hydrocarbons and extractive industries are missing .
This is not only apparent in their lack in the document , but that the group which formed to discuss these industries at the conference – the unofficial 18th working group – was almost stopped from convening , and its conclusions were not taken into consideration for the final document .
If there is one serious worry about the Bolivian government , it is thatit may be closing its ears against even this constructive criticism .
Is the IPCC as radical as reality ?
But at the same time Tanuro and Invernizzi criticise the conference documents for being too radical in their overall aims , such as limiting temperature rise to 1°C .
“ In fact , even a rise of 2 °C can probably no longer be avoided ” , they write .
“ The most radical of the stabilisation scenarios mentioned in the fourth report of the IPCC estimates that there will be a concentration of between 445 and 490 ppm in 2050 , corresponding to a rise in temperature of between 2 and 2.4°C and to a rise of the level of the oceans of between 0.4 and 1.4 m ( on balance ) .
We could possibly return one day to 300 ppm , and a difference in temperature of 1 °C compared to the preindustrial era , as the declaration demands , but certainly not in the course of this century : that will demand a very long - term effort . ”
While Tanuro and Invernizzi are not unusual in taking this IPCC view as the authoritiative statement , they are the ones who are actually being unrealistic – unrealistic to assume that it is possible to prevent dangerous climate change without taking such drastic and radical action as the Cochabamba summit demanded .
Australian campaigner David Spratt writes that “ if emissions keep growing at the present rate , the carbon emissions budget for the 2 degrees target will run out in 2021 ! ”
Essentially , a 2 °C rise runs a high risk that climate change will run away out of all hope of returning it to something like what we are accustomed to .
It will mean melting icecaps , large sea level rises ( upwards of 1 metre this century ) , drought and famine , and possibly worse if large - scale feedbacks like the Arctic tundra 's buried methane are activated .
The IPCC does not look at managing risks like these in any real detail .
It takes only the most established , peer reviewed science – which is great if you want to build a watertight case to prove something beyond a doubt .
If you want to avoid potential risk in the future , however , you also have to look at the latest research including worst - case scenarios that may not have yet gone through the whole process of peer review .
Further , if we want to “ possibly return one day to 300 ppm , and a difference in temperature of 1 °C compared to the preindustrial era ” then we have to stop temperature rise at 1°C .
Temperature is held in the oceans , which store a vast amount of heat .
Once the temperature does rise , it will take hundreds , perhaps thousands of years to revert – even if the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases is returned to a pre-industrial level .
The sea takes a lot longer to cool down .
Fortunately , the sea also takes time to heat up .
There is approximately a 20 - year lag between when carbon emissions occur and when the resultant heating is felt in the atmosphere .
This means that there is a ( fast closing ) window of opportunity to cut emissions now and start drawing carbon back out of the atmosphere , to arrest the rise in temperature at a lower level .
It can still have an effect .
Tanuro and Invernizzi then suggest , “ In the name of the precaution principle , it is only logical and right to demand that the global North make at least 40 per cent of reduction by 2020 and 95 per cent by 2050 , not counting the purchases of carbon credits . ”
But this is not fully following the precautionary principle .
Spratt has answered this very well in an article entitled " What 's up with emisions reductions of 25 - 40 % by 2020 ? " .
Australian research / campaign group Beyond Zero Emissions has just released a fully costed plan to replace all Australia ’s energy , using only available technology , within 10 years .
While not every country could achieve this as easily as Australia ( which has a large , sunny , windy land mass and small population ) it gives real hope for the demand that the rich countries cut emissions by 50 % before 2017 .
It also counters the pessimistic notion that “ the countries of the global North would need to have recourse to dangerous and socially doubtful technologies such as clean coal , biofuels and nuclear power ” .
Constructing alliances for ecological revolution
Tanuro and Invernizzi suggest that the Cochabamba demands are so wildly unrealistic that “ for it to be practicable , it would in fact be necessary for an anti-productivist socialist revolution to triumph tomorrow , simultaneously in all the developed capitalist countries ” .
We can hope !
But of course that is unlikely .
And the lack of attention paid to the hydrocarbon industries does leave a gap in terms of what activists could do to attack the system right now .
But it does not leave a complete gap in terms of what to do .
Tanuro and Invernizzi write that “ there is something unrealistic about the People 's Agreement when it demands that the countries of the North not only go further than the most radical scenario of the IPCC , but are furthermore the only ones who have to make an effort ” .
In my reading between the lines , the reason why the Bolivian ( and other ALBA ) governments are putting such hard demands on the rich world , while not making demands on the poor countries , is that they are trying to construct a bloc of the poor countries that can challenge the “ Copenhagen club ” of rich industrialised countries .
As an international alliance , this has to be based on clear demands that can realistically be agreed on .
The omission of demands on poor / developing countries ( which includes China , Brazil and India in the Kyoto definitions ) does not mean that climate activists ought to ignore problems in those countries .
It is , however , an opportunity to gain ground against the central cause of the problem – the nations at the centre of the imperialist power structure .
There is a key role for activists in the imperialist countries here .
While the ALBA countries and the Alliance of Small Island States can rail against the world ’s carbon criminal governments inside summits , their words are only given weight in the media of the rich countries if they are matched by mass protest outside of the summits .
` Third worldist ' ?
Tanuro and Invernizzi write , “ In the case of the global South , the way in which the agreement proposes to concretise the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities tends to ignore the necessary criticism of the productivist development strategies of certain ruling classes , such as those of Brazil , China or … Venezuela , for example , as a large oil producer . ”
Is it fair for Bolivia and Venezuela to take the moral high ground when they depend on fossil fuel exports ?
I live in Australia , the world ’s worst per capita carbon polluter and world ’s biggest coal exporter .
Unlike Australia , these countries are very poor and would probably not survive if they ended their fossil fuel exports rapidly .
If Australia did so , the main pain would be felt by the shareholders of various mining multinationals .
Australia is a rich country with enough capital to diversify and replace these industries .
How can Bolivia move away from simple resource extraction industry ?
It is a real battle to get even the most basic industrialisation in a country so poor .
I do n’t know much about Venezuela , but it is quite clear that Bolivia ’s “ productivist ” use of its natural gas exports is simply a survival mechanism .
Bolivia is an incredibly poor , cash - starved country .
A friend of mine in Bolivia said he finds it hard to get supplies as basic as a 6 mm stainless steel bolt for building his watermotor .
That ’s a standard size , it should n’t be hard to find !
That is how de-industrialised Bolivia is .
The measures in the Cochabamba documents that call for 6 % of rich countries ’
GDP to go to climate aid are a real need , not some kind of “ third - worldist ” ideological stunt .
Of course these demands could be hard to sell to a First World working class mired in consumerism and suffering a class struggle that in many countries is very one sided ( on the employers ’ side ! ) .
On the other hand , the revolt in the Third World could be a powerful inspiration for the First World : this is what happened in the 1950s - 70s as the great wave of decolonisation struggles shook the world .
Now it is time for a great struggle for decarbonisation .
There are indeed gaps in the Cochabamba People 's Agreement .
Some of these omissions seem to serve useful purposes .
Others need to be filled in , but overall , the course set at Cochabamba is far closer to what is needed than Tanuro and Invernizzi realise .

SAN FRANCISCO 
Like an impatient audience at intermission , Google ’s investors are waiting for its second act .
Google continues to dominate in its core business , search advertising , which accounts for more than 90 percent of its revenue .
But as Google grows and search becomes increasingly competitive , analysts and investors are beginning to wonder what is next for the company .
In a sign of their impatience , Google ’s stock price has sunk 17 percent over the last three months .
It fell about 4 percent , to $ 474 , in after - hours trading on Thursday after its announcement that both revenue and net income rose 24 percent in the second quarter , which ended June 30 .
The company said its net income rose to $ 1.84 billion , or $ 5.71 a share , from $ 1.48 billion , or $ 4.66 a share .
Excluding the cost of stock options and the related tax benefits , Google ’s second - quarter profit was $ 6.45 a share .
BUDAPEST ( Reuters ) -
The IMF and EU suspended on Saturday a review of Hungary ’s funding program , set up in 2008 to save the country from financial meltdown , saying it must take tough action to meet targets for cutting its budget deficit .

Suspension of talks means Hungary will not have access to remaining funds in its $ 25.1 billion loan package , created by the International Monetary Fund and European Union and which it now uses as financial safety net , until the review is concluded .
Negotiations with the lenders had been expected to finish early next week .
Analysts said the forint currency could fall sharply when financial markets reopen Monday due to uncertainty over the international safety net for Hungary , which has financed itself from the markets since last year .
“ In an environment of heightened market scrutiny of government deficits and debt levels , the fiscal deficit targets previously announced -- 3.8 percent of GDP in 2010 and below 3 percent of GDP in 2011 -- remain an appropriate anchor for the necessary consolidation process and debt sustainability , and should be adhered to , but additional measures will need to be taken to achieve these objectives , ” the IMF said .
“ Sustainable consolidation will require durable , non-distortive measures , which the authorities need more time to develop , ” it said in a statement .
HITTING WHERE IT HURTS MOST
Hungary ’s new center - right government , which swept to power in April elections , has said it wanted to extend its current financing deal with lenders until the end of 2010 and seek a precautionary deal for 2011 and 2012 .
Economy Minister Gyorgy Matolcsy made clear the government was keen to resume negotiations .
“ The government will of course continue talks with international organizations including the IMF and the EU , ” he said in a statement published by the national news agency MTI Saturday .
Christoph Rosenberg , who led the IMF delegation to Hungary , signaled that the Fund wanted more on next year ’s budget .
“ By definition when we come next time -- unless we come next week -- the government will have made more progress on the 2011 budget and that will be a very important budget , ” he told Reuters .
In an interview , he also said the IMF had not discussed the possibility of a new financing deal for 2011 and 2012 .
“ We are aware of what has been said in public but in our meetings we did n’t really get to that point , because we obviously needed to first resolve the policy issues and those have not been resolved , ” he said .
The EU issued a separate statement saying the conclusion of the review had to be postponed and further talks should be held at a later stage .
“ Hungary has returned to a positive economic growth path and now has one of the lowest budget deficits in the EU .
I welcome the authorities ’ commitment to the 2010 deficit target , ” said Olli Rehn , Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs .
“ However , the correction of the excessive deficit by next year will require tough decisions , notably on spending . ”
Hungary needs the IMF / EU safety net to keep the trust of investors from whom it borrows .
But the country remains vulnerable due to its high public debt , which is equal to 80 percent of GDP , and its strong reliance on foreign financing .
“ If we do not have the safety net of international lenders , that hits us where it hurts most , ” said MKB Bank analyst Zsolt Kondrat .
“ One would definitely expect a weakening forint Monday .
A 10 - forint weakening ( versus the euro ) is quite plausible , and nobody knows how nervous the market ’s reaction might be . ”
The forint traded at around 282 to the euro Friday .
Neighboring Romania had to take tough steps last month to secure the release of its IMF aid and reassure investors .
Ice - T plays a Manhattan cop on TV’s “ Law & Order : SVU ” — but he showed he has no love for the NYPD ’s real boys in blue yesterday .
“ Some punk bitch rookie cop named Fisher made the arrest of his bullsh – -t career today , ” the pony - tailed actor sniped on his Twitter page after being busted at the Lincoln Tunnel for allegedly driving with a suspended license and not wearing a seat belt .
“ Arresting the Notorious Ice T for no seatbelt ! . . .
[ The cop ] said , ‘ I know who you are , and I do n’t give a f – – k !’
That was right after I called him a punk bitch . ”
The rapper - turned - actor , 52 , and his buxom , blond wife , Coco , were in their white 2009 Cadillac sedan waiting at the entrance to the Lincoln Tunnel around 9 a.m. — heading home to New Jersey after dropping off their bulldog , Spartacus , with a Manhattan vet for knee surgery — when the mirror of the car brushed against a cop at a random checkpoint , authorities said .
The officer motioned for the actor to pull over , but he kept on going , officials said .
The cop ran up to the car and banged on its tinted window , sources said .
As soon as Ice - T lowered his window , the officer recognized him and remained professional , police sources said .
In addition to the suspended license and not wearing his seat belt , the tough - guy actor — who has played Detective Fin Tutuola on “ Law & Order : Special Victims Unit ” since 2000 — also did n’t have valid insurance , police said .
The former rapper — who became infamous in 1992 for his song “ Cop Killer , ” which advocated killing police in revenge for brutality — was given a desk - appearance ticket and released , but not before being handcuffed , fingerprinted and spending nearly three hours at the precinct .
Ice - T later said the suspended - license charge was bogus , but he did not deny using language unsuited for prime time .
“ I think [ the cop ] got his rocks off bringing me in the station in handcuffs , ” he told The Post .
“ I stopped breaking the law a long time ago , ” said the former rapper , whose real name is Tracey Morrow .
“ I ai n’t trying to get in trouble . ”
His TV partner , Richard Belzer , quipped : “ I think they arrested him because they wanted to see Coco , and I do n’t blame them .
He ’s never committed a crime to my knowledge and never will . ”

Although beer making is mostly done commercially today , there was a time when it was a strictly domestic affair .
Almost every sizable household brewed its own beer .
Back then beer was n’t consumed out of pleasure but necessity ; it was much cleaner and safer to drink than water so everyone drank it , including monks .
Saint Benedict decreed in the sixth century that monks should live a self - sufficient lifestyle , with everything they would ever need available in their monastery .
This would prevent them from ever having to venture into the secular world , where they might encounter sinful temptation .
Because beer was a basic necessity of life at the time , most Benedictine monasteries had a brewery on premises .
Fast forward to the 17th century , when Abbaye de la Trappe , a Cistercian monastery , was founded in Normandy , France .
The Trappists , as these monks would eventually be known , became famous for their discipline and craftsmanship .
They produced a variety of high quality goods they sold to provide for themselves , items like beer .
By the 18th century the Trappists were driven out of Normandy by the French Revolution , eventually settling in Belgium and the Netherlands , but not resuming brewing commercially till the 1830s .
Today just seven Trappist monasteries that brew remain : Chimay , Westmalle , Orval , Rochefort , Westvleteren , Achel and Brouwerij de Koningshoeven .
These are the only breweries which can use the “ Trappist ” term on their beer .
Other breweries who produce beer in a similar style usually use the term “ abbey ale ” or something similar .
Whether it ’s made by actual monks or simply inspired by them , beers in this category usually fall into one of the following styles :
Dubbel –
These ales are dark red in color with a sweet , malty taste that has notes of caramel or toffee to it .
Compared to other dark Belgian beers it has a fairly mid-range body , but it ’s still pretty substantial .
As with most Trappist ales , hop presence is fairly low .
Chimay Red is perhaps the wost well know variety , St. Bernardus Prior 8 is another really amazing version .
7 - 9 % ABV .
Tripel –
Pale yellow to golden in color , with a much lighter , but much sweeter body than the dubbel , these beers can be deceptively strong .
Thanks to the use of Belgian candy sugar for some of the malt , the alcohol can be much higher than a usual brew without adding much to the body .
Chimay
White is probably the most widely available in the US .
Westmalle Tripel is another delicious version .
Also be sure to check out Victory ’s Golden Monkey for a great American take on this style .
8 - 12 % ABV .
Quadrupel – Originally developed at the Brouwerij de Koningshoeven in the Netherlands , the only Trappist brewery outside of Belgium .
This style is known as one of the darkest and heaviest styles around .
It ’s extremely dark with rich , malty notes of plums or other heavier fruits .
Over time the style has evolved a bit to become something of a catch all term for any exceptionally dark and heavy Belgian style ale , but the Trappist brewers still brew them the same way .
Chimay Blue is a classic example of this style .
St. Bernardus 12 is another great variety .
10 - 14 % ABV .
The double / trippel / quad naming scheme refers to how much malt was traditionally used in each of these beers as compared to a “ simple ale , ” a now all but extinct term .
Today malt levels vary considerably , but the names still provide a good indication of what to expect .
Whilst a knife ( for whatever purpose ) is something that many include in their EDC * , the Tops Hoffman Harpoon Knife may not be technically be the right one for you .
Saying that , it most definitely needs to be considered as one to add to or start your collection ....

LONDON / MADRID ( Reuters ) - Just seven European banks failed a health check and were ordered to raise their capital by 3.5 billion euros ( $ 4.5 billion ) , much less than expected , confirming fears the continent ’s long - awaited stress test was too soft .
Results of the test of how 91 banks in 20 countries would cope with another recession was released on Friday in a bid to restore investor confidence after the Greek debt crisis spooked markets earlier this year .
But it fell on deaf ears .
“ There is little evidence that the tests have been applied consistently and there is a distinct lack of credibility , making this a wasted opportunity , ” said Richard Cranfield at international law firm Allen & Overy .
While the modest findings cast doubt on the credibility of the bank tests , some analysts said that may not matter because the European economy is improving fast .
The survey also showed how much government bonds are marked down on bank books , with Greek debt discounted the most , at 23 percent .
Analysts had expected five to 10 banks to fail the test , but estimated the capital shortfall could be over 30 billion euros .
As expected , no big banks failed the health check .
“ I see nothing stressful about this test .
It ’s like sending the banks away for a weekend of R&R , ” said Stephen Pope , chief global equity strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald .
The Committee of European Bank Supervisors ( CEBS ) , a previously little known group with 25 staff at a small London office , which coordinated the process , said its test was more severe than the U.S. one .
“ With this undertaking , the EU has made a significant effort to increase disclosure on the conditions of individual European financial institutions and enhance market stability , ” said U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner , who had pushed Europeans to do their own tests .
A health check on U.S. banks last year helped restore investor confidence and underpinned a recovery by bank shares .
Five of Spain ’s smaller regional lenders , known as cajas , failed the test .
Their recapitalization will almost complete a state - funded drive to consolidate the country ’s network of unlisted savings banks .
They need 1.8 billion euros , the Bank of Spain said .
Banks in Germany and Greece were also seen as weak spots and in need of restructuring , but state - owned Hypo Real Estate was the only German lender to flunk and state - controlled ATEbank the only Greek one .
The euro ended flat against the dollar after falling initially on questions whether the stress tests were tough enough .
German government bond futures fell on relief that they threw up no nasty surprises .
European bank shares , up on the week , closed before the results were announced .
U.S. stocks were little changed after the stress test and closed higher on U.S. company results .
The cost of insuring the debt of most European banks fell .
“ Despite questions about transparency and how the Euro stress tests do n’t measure up to the U.S. tests last year , I think these tests will start to put these euro zone concerns behind us , ” said Chris Rupkey , chief financial economist at Bank of Tokyo / Mitsubishi UFJ in New York .
“ There might be some initial disappointment leading to some selling on Monday when European markets reopen , but the market will soon get over it . ”

GOVERNMENT BONDS DISCLOSURE
Under the most severe scenario , banks were tested on how they would cope with a moderate recession this year and next , with additional losses on government bonds thrown in .
As part of the process , many of the banks revealed all of their sovereign debt holdings , but some dodged full disclosure , raising further question marks .
Any bank whose Tier 1 capital ratio falls below 6 percent by the end of 2011 failed the test , and would be expected to raise funds to make up the capital shortfall .

Of most concern to investors was that government bond losses were only applied to trading books , and not hold - to - maturity bonds , as the test did not consider there was a risk of any sovereign default .
Banks ’ holdings of government bonds were subjected to a 23.1 percent loss on their Greek debt , a 12.3 percent loss on Spanish bonds and a 4.7 percent loss on German debt , all based on 5 - year bonds and their value at the end of 2009 .
SPAIN , GERMANY IN SPOTLIGHT
The hunt for weak spots in European banking has focused on Spain ’s regional savings banks , as well as regional German lenders , known as landesbanks .
Spain and Germany have set up funds to help weak banks recapitalize and Spain wants more cajas to merge .
The Spanish banks to flunk were Banca Civica , Diada , Espiga , Unnim and Cajasur .
The worst case scenario included a 28 percent fall in Spanish house prices during 2010 - 11 .
Banks that came close to failing with a Tier 1 ratio of less than 7 percent under the most stressed scenario included Germany ’s Deutsche Postbank , Greece ’s Piraeus , Allied Irish Banks , Italy ’s UBI Banca and Spain ’s Bankinter .
“ The banks that have scraped through may have more of a challenge on their hands and they may be the ones the market focuses on , ” said Cranfield .
Last year ’s U.S. bank test helped draw a line under worries about the sector there and Europe ’s attempt to match it has faced splits in the 27 - nation EU about how to model the test and how much to divulge .
European banks have also already raised about 300 billion euros since the start of the crisis , whereas the U.S. tests kick - started the fundraising .
Banks in Ireland , Greece , Spain and Germany have also already received funds or are in the process of doing so , possibly pre-emptively to help them pass the test .

A few days after saying he intends to take action against Israeli professors who call for an academic boycott of Israel , Education Minister Gideon Sa'ar is scheduled to appear on Monday before the Knesset Education Committee to discuss the limits of freedom of expression in schools .
Sa'ar refused to provide Haaretz with details of what action he plans to take .
His statements , made in the Knesset plenum Wednesday , " speak for themselves , " a spokesperson said .
Open gallery view Education Minister Gideon Saar Credit : Haaretz
The comments came some time after Ben-Gurion University Professor Neve Gordon , a vocal proponent of an academic boycott against Israel , received a death threat through the mail .
The principals of two Tel Aviv high schools , Zeev Dagani and Ram Cohen , who have publicly criticized the government 's policies in the territories , have also been invited to today 's committee meeting .
Dagani , the principal of the Herzliya Gymnasia high school , has publicly opposed Sa'ar 's plan to send Israel Defense Forces officers into classrooms to encourage students to enlist in the army , and Cohen has often lectured his students about the Israeli occupation .
The panel will also discuss the Islamic Movement 's influence on students in Arab schools .
In last week 's comments , Sa'ar said it was " important to examine the issues " raised in a report by on - campus Zionist advocacy group Im Tirtzu that alleges that anti-Zionist trends have taken root in political science instruction at Israel 's universities .
However , Sa'ar would not say whether he would indeed look into the accusations .
Sa'ar 's statements were part of a discussion in the Knesset plenum initiated by MKs Uri Ariel ( National Union ) and Yulia Shamalov Berkovich ( Kadima ) on the issue of " the post - Zionist takeover of Israeli academia . "
The discussion was prompted by the Im Tirtzu report , which stated that 80 percent of the research papers taught at political science courses in Israeli universities are " anti-Zionist and anti-nationalist . "
The report was roundly criticized by academics and public figures , but Im Tirtzu officials said they stood behind the study .
" Israeli academia apparently suffers from ' Palestinomania , ' a mild psychological illness whose symptoms include self - hatred , an affinity for Israel 's enemies , Jewish anti-Semitism and / or anti-Zionism , " Shamalov Berkovich said in the Knesset .
" The spread of ' Palestinomania ' demands the immediate and painful treatment for all of our sake , and the sooner the better . "
Ariel called on Sa'ar to establish a ministerial inquiry to probe the accusations contained in Im Tirtzu 's report .
Sa'ar said : " I think that the Im Tirtzu report is important in the sense that it generates public debate .
It is important to examine the issues raised in the report . "
In his statements to the plenum , Sa'ar referred specifically to professors who have backed calls to boycott Israeli universities .
" This is something that is impossible to accept , " Sa'ar said .
" I have already spoken about this with the head of the Higher Education Council 's planning and budgeting committee [ Manuel Trajtenberg ] , and there will be measures taken vis-a - vis the heads of these institutions .
This matter is on our agenda - and we plan on taking action over the course of the summer . "
Ariel seemed to understand Sa'ar as saying he plans to investigate the charges .
His office released a statement reading : " The education minister said that he plans on thoroughly probing the charges made by Im Tirtzu this coming summer . "
A spokesperson for Trajtenberg refused to comment when reached by Haaretz , deferring to Sa'ar 's office .
" It would behoove the education minister to ignore the report , which emits an aroma of McCarthyism , " said Professor Yossi Ben-Artzi , the rector of the University of Haifa .
" I hope he will understand the gravity of the very fact of monitoring and informing on lecturers , and of whether he even needs to take seriously an organization like Im Tirtzu , which causes incitement . "
Earlier this year Sa'ar took part in a conference organized by Im Tirtzu .
" I place great importance in this gathering , " he said .
" Campus activism is hugely vital , and this is what you are doing .
For this , you will be blessed . "
" I very much appreciate this work , which gives expression to an authentic Zeitgeist felt by the public and is much needed on our campuses , " Sa'ar said of Im Tirtzu .
" I came to tell you : God speed . "

All intellectual systems rely on assumptions that do not need to be spelled out because all members of that particular intellectual community accept them .
These " deep " axioms are implicit in economics as well but , if left unscrutinised , they can steer policymakers into a blind alley .
That is what is happening in today 's effort , in country after country , to slash spending and bring down budget deficits .
The chief task that John Maynard Keynes set himself in writing his General Theory of Employment , Interest , and Money was to uncover the deep axioms underlying the economic orthodoxy of his day , which assumed away the possibility of persistent mass unemployment .
The question he asked of his opponents was : " What must they believe in order to claim that persistent mass unemployment is impossible , so that government ' stimulus ' to raise the employment level could do no good ? "
In answering this question , Keynes reconstructed the orthodox theory – and then proceeded to demolish it .
Today , despite the Keynesian revolution , the same question demands an answer .
What do people who demand rapid " fiscal consolidation " amid heavy unemployment need to believe about the economy to make their policy coherent ?
This question is not trivial , because the fiscal hair shirt has become the favoured article of policy clothing among those who now dictate economic affairs .
Prestigious bodies such as the G20 , the IMF and the OECD join the " markets " and economic columnists in demanding that governments liquidate their deficits .
Any other course , they say , spells disaster ; balancing budgets as soon as possible is the only way back to prosperity .
A few Keynesian economists stand against this stampede to retrenchment – Paul Krugman , Joseph Stiglitz and Brad DeLong in the United States ; Martin Wolf , Samuel Brittan , Danny Blanchflower and I in the UK ; and Paul de Grauwe and Jean - Paul Fitoussi in continental Europe .
But we are a small minority .
Indeed , all western governments , with the exception of the Obama administration , are committed to retrenchment – and Obama cannot get a new stimulus package through Congress .
The question is : what must the cutters and slashers believe to justify their policies ?
When I ask this question , I never get a coherent answer ; so let me retrace Keynes 's steps .
The first of the implicit assumptions of orthodox theory that Keynes identified was Say 's law , the doctrine that " supply creates its own demand " .
This means that all money earned is bound to be spent , and therefore that at no point in time could there be a " general glut " of commodities .
Keynes pointed out the fallacy here : while the income derived from production is , by definition , equal to the value of production , it does not follow that all this income will be spent .
Some part of it may be " hoarded " , in which case demand may fall short of supply .
Specifically , Keynes denied that saving is simply deferred spending .
In a well - known passage , he wrote : " An act of saving means … a decision not to have dinner today .
But it does not necessitate a decision to have dinner or to buy a pair of boots a week hence …
Thus it depresses the business of preparing today 's dinner without stimulating the business of making ready for some future act of consumption . "
" Getting to that realisation , " says Krugman , " was an awesome intellectual achievement . "
Yet Say 's law is alive and well among new classical macroeconomists such as John Cochrane and Eugene Fama .
It amounts to claiming that the factors of production will always be fully employed , and that , in Cochrane 's words , " if the government borrows a dollar from you , that is a dollar that you do not spend , or that you do not lend to a company to spend on new investment . "
The second classical postulate Keynes identified was that the " real wage is equal to the marginal disutility of labour " .
This means that , in a competitive labour market , real wages will always be instantly adjusted to changes in conditions of demand .
In other words , there can never be involuntary , or unwanted , unemployment .
Keynes denied that real wages are set in the labour market .
Workers bargain for money wages , and a reduction in their money incomes might leave total demand too low to employ all those willing to work .
Yet today most economists model unemployment as " voluntary " – a rational preference for leisure rather than work .
This reinforces the idea that " stimulus " cannot do any good , since workers have as much employment as they want .
Keynes thought that the chief implicit assumption underlying the classical theory of the economy was that of perfect knowledge .
" Risks , " he wrote , " were supposed to be capable of an exact actuarial computation .
The calculus of probability … was supposed to be capable of reducing uncertainty to the same calculable status as certainty itself . "
For Keynes , this is untenable : " Actually …we have as a rule only the vaguest idea of any but the most direct consequences of our acts . "
This made investment , which is always a bet on the future , dependent on fluctuating states of confidence .
Financial markets , through which investment is made , were always liable to collapse when something happened to disturb business confidence .
Therefore , market economies were inherently unstable .
Today 's " efficient market theory " restored to economics the assumption of perfect knowledge by claiming that all risks are correctly priced .
This means that the " underpricing of risk worldwide " , which Alan Greenspan identified as the root cause of the banking collapse of 2007 - 08 , is impossible .
Yet it happened .
The classical view of the economy , which Keynes set out to demolish , is not only alive , but in recent years has been dominant , feeding the belief that competitive markets can be left to regulate themselves , will always provide as much employment as is wanted , and are immune to large - scale collapse .
This also fuels opposition to government intervention , and to " stimulus " policies , which are supposedly redundant , if not harmful , since the events that require them cannot happen ( but do ) .
Unless we start discussing economics in a Keynesian framework , we are doomed to a succession of crises and recessions .
If we do n't , the next one will come sooner than we think .

Arizona State University ’s W.P. Carey School of Business has begun a research project to determine how Arizonians can make the most of the state ’s sustainable energy resources .
Economists and engineers will be working to draw solar and other renewable energy companies to the state , and develop interactive tools that will help users get information on renewables and make decisions on what resources would be best for their location .
The study will hopefully serve as a model for other states as they look for ways to reduce their dependence on foreign oil , reduce emissions , and develop a clean technology economy .
The SMART Project , which stands for Solar Market Analysis and Research Tool , will provide state residents and businesses with a web tool to allow them to determine if solar power would be an option for them , based on their location and cost constraints .
In addition , policymakers and large businesses will have access to information regarding job creation and the environmental impact of larger projects .
“ Most of the talk about solar energy has focused on how to make it more efficient and technically viable , ” says Professor Tim James , director of research and consulting at the L. William Seidman Research Institute at ASU ’s W. P. Carey School of Business .
“ There ’s been little comprehensive thought about how to put solar and other renewable energy into place to help the economy .
Things like state permits , tax credits and other incentives need to be carefully considered , along with technical feasibility and potential locations , so we can all get the most bang for our buck . ”
The SMART project also includes technical research by ASU ’s Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering .
Engineers will be looking at how to “ plug - in ” renewables projects to the existing grid , along with other technical aspects that go along with implementing clean energy .
Professor Vijay Vittal , the Ira A. Fulton Chair Professor , explains , “ The primary focus of this analysis is to ascertain the viability of the transmission grid with increased penetration of solar resources and to also determine the needed transmission reinforcement to achieve the required reliability performance . ”
SMART is funded by several partners , including APS , BrightSource Energy , Salt River Project , Science Foundation Arizona , Tucson Electric Power , ViaSol Energy Solutions and software maker CreateASoft , Inc .
Arizona State University has demonstrated a high commitment to sustainability through efforts such as creation of the first School of Sustainability in the nation and the installation of large solar fields on the roofs of several campus parking structures .
The Princeton Review recently named ASU one of the “ greenest ” universities in the country .

WASHINGTON , June 17 , 2010  --
The Supreme Court today ruled that the state of Florida did not have to compensate several beachfront property owners when a beach renourishment project changed the owners ' property lines .
The case came to the court when Walton County , Florida officials , citing dangerous beach erosion along the Gulf of Mexico , stepped in and added sand along a 6.9 mile stretch in 2003 , using taxpayer money .
Florida 's Beach and Shore Preservation
Act authorizes publicly funded beach restoration to protect critically eroded beaches , and the county 's multimillion dollar project added new sand , reshaping dunes and in some areas substantially increasing the size of the beach .
But the improvements , according to Florida law , also made that " new " strip of beach public property , infuriating residents like Nancy and Slade Lindsay , who have a home overlooking the gulf in the town of Destin .
They said the action amounted to the state unlawfully taking ownership of their private beachfront property .
" They are literally taking our property , " Slade Lindsay said .
" Changing our deeds , changing our property boundaries , no compensation and no tax breaks . "
The Lindsays and four other residents along the sandy stretch filed a lawsuit to challenge Florida 's actions .
The state 's highest court ruled in favor of the Florida government .
The homeowners then brought their case to the U.S. Supreme Court , arguing that the Florida Supreme Court decision had unconstitutionally deprived them of their property .
In legalese , the homeowners said that the state court decision constituted a " judicial taking " of their property , which the U.S. Constitution prohibits .
Today , the court ruled unanimously against the property owners in the case , finding that the state had not improperly confiscated property that would lead to a judicial taking .
" The court 's ruling today supports Florida 's efforts to restore eroded beaches and preserves the ability of state and local governments to respond to changing environmental conditions , " said Doug Kendall of the Constitutional Accountability Center .
" As the oil spill now ravaging our nation 's coastlines vividly demonstrates , it is crucially important that the government have the authority to step in to protect our beaches and coastal communities . "
However , some of the justices left open the possibility that in other cases , with different facts , they might rule the state was guilty of a " judicial taking . "
Court Rules Narrowly on Prospect of ' Judicial Taking ' of Private Property
" The four conservative justices recognized that the judicial branch of government is not insulated from the protections afforded to private property owners by the U.S. Constitution , " said Richard Brightman , an attorney for the homeowners .
" We are disappointed by the ruling but it leaves open the possibility of other judicial takings cases in the future , " he said .
Justice John Paul Stevens took no part in the decision , possibly because he owns beachfront property in Fort Lauderdale , Florida .
The pandemic that never was : Drug firms ' encouraged world health body to exaggerate swine flu threat '
Widespread warnings were issued about the swine flu ' pandemic '
Declaring a swine flu pandemic was a ' monumental error ' , driven by profit - hungry drug companies spreading fear , an influential report has concluded .
It led to huge amounts of taxpayers ' money being wasted in stockpiling vaccines , it added .
Paul Flynn , the Labour MP charged with investigating the handling of the swine flu outbreak for the Council of Europe , described it as ' a pandemic that never really was ' .
The report accuses the World Health Organisation of grave shortcomings in the transparency of the process that led to its warning last year .
The MP said that the world relied on the WHO , but after ' crying wolf ' , its reputation was in jeopardy .
The report questions whether the pandemic was driven by drug companies seeking a profit .
Mr Flynn said predictions of a ' plague ' that would wipe out up to 7.5 million people proved to be ' an exaggeration ' , with fewer than 20,000 deaths worldwide .
Britain braced itself for up to 65,000 deaths and signed vaccine contracts worth £ 540 million .
The actual number of deaths was fewer than 500 and the country is now desperately trying to unpick the contracts and unload millions of unused jabs .
The focus on swine flu also led to other health services suffering and widespread public fear .
Pharmaceutical companies , however , profited to the tune of £ 4.6 billion from the sale of vaccines alone .
Mr Flynn said : ' There is not much doubt that this was an exaggeration on stilts .
They vastly over - stated the danger on bad science and the national governments were in a position where they had to take action .
' In Britain , we have spent at least £ 1 billion on preparations , to the detriment of other parts of the health system .
This is a monumental failure on the WHO 's part . '
The Council of Europe inquiry heard allegations that the WHO had downgraded its definition for declaring a pandemic last spring - just weeks before announcing there was a worldwide outbreak .
Critics said the decision to remove any need to consider the deadliness of the disease was driven by drug companies desperate to recoup the billions of pounds they had invested in developing pandemic vaccines after the bird flu scares .
But the WHO said its basic definition of a pandemic never changed .
Mr Flynn said : ' It does n't make any sense as to why they should have changed the definition a month before declaring an outbreak .
' In this case , it might not just be a conspiracy theory , it might be a very profitable conspiracy . '
A Daily Mail investigation earlier this year revealed more than half of the swine flu taskforce advising the Government on its strategy had ties to drug companies .
Eleven of the 20 members of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies had done work for the pharmaceutical industry or are linked to it through their universities .
Concerns about drug companies ' influence are also highlighted by a separate investigation by the British Medical Journal and the London - based Bureau of Investigative Journalism .
It found that key scientists behind the WHO 's advice on stockpiling pandemic flu pills such as Tamiflu had financial ties with the drug companies that stood to profit .
The WHO last night firmly rejected all the criticism .
Spokesman Gregory Hartl said : ' There is no question of this being a fake pandemic .
If fits the criteria for a pandemic , which is a new virus to which human beings have little or no immunity and which has spread around the world .
' It spread from zero to 74 countries in the space of 9 weeks - that 's a pandemic . '
He said that not all ties to drug companies were necessarily conflicts of interest .

DIRTY HALF DOZEN : Tahi Poasa , 19 , sitting , and Jarred Turnbull , 20 , in the living room of their Christchurch flat which won the national " Smells Kitchen " competition .
Police have been called to disperse a rowdy crowd at New Zealand 's filthiest flat today .
A group of Christchurch students won a national radio competition called " Smells Kitchen " to find the scummiest living conditions in the country .
The Totara
St flat beat entries from Otago and Hamilton to take the dubious honour with 52 per cent of the online vote .
The six men hosted a breakfast barbecue today with The Rock host Bryce Casey broadcasting from their living room .
Guests included Richard Loe , Andy Ellis and Christchurch Mayor Bob Parker .
But the party did not disperse after the show and neighbours complained to police after celebrations dragged on late in the day .
Three police cars were in attendance when The Press visited this afternoon , and officers dispersed around 30 people .
The Fire Service also paid a visit to the flat earlier in the day after reports the students were burning furniture .
The six Canterbury University students , Jarred Turnbull , Tahi Poasa , Hamish Catherwood , James Lentjes , Geert Lepoutre and Adam Lill moved into the house eight months ago .
They declined to be interviewed further .
Yesterday , speaking from under a mountain of dishes , Turnbull said the house now had a seventh flatmate , a friendly rat .
A hole had also developed in the roof of his bedroom that had leaked , destroying his laptop and disabling the lights .
The house could get cold in winter , with only the oven used for heating , he said .
Lepoutre said a Facebook page to mobilise votes was set up and brought a lot of support .
" We did n't think we were too bad , we 've got a real good cooking roster ... we usually do the dishes but the other cleaning , we do n't do it . "
Admitting there had been a few unhappy mums with news of the win , Lepoutre was hopeful the house would now get cleaned up .
" If we can find some girls to clean it up that would be ideal , " he said .

On July 4th , let ’s look at the best things The Simpsons have said about the country they call home .
My roommate Gabe was in Europe last year and ended up in a conversation about The Simpsons with some German people .
He found that they love the show — but love it differently than we do .
While we appreciate Homer for being the hyperbolic - ly satirical embodiment of every American stereotype … they just like that he ’s a dumb American doing dumb American things like all dumb Americans do .
To them , the show is n’t satire , it ’s an animated documentary .
So , on this July 4th , in the spirit of the international camaraderie , appreciate these Simpsons quotes about America however you see fit .
Even if you live in Brazil .
1 | On capitalism
Adil the exchange student :
How can you defend a country where 5 percent of the people control 95 percent of the wealth ?
Lisa :
I ’m defending a country where people can think , and act , and worship any way they want !
Adil : Can not .
Lisa : Can too .
Adil : Can not !
Lisa : Can too !
Homer : Please , kids , stop fighting .
Maybe Lisa ’s right about America being the land of opportunity , and maybe Adil ’s got a point about the machinery of capitalism being oiled with the blood of the workers .
Of course , this quote would n’t be relevant today , since I do n’t know if you ’ve heard but America ’s now a communist / socialist dictatorship where the President is achieving his dream of sitting back , running all the businesses , and deciding whether or not you ’re going to get that ankle surgery you ’re hankerin ’ for .
But like 20 years ago when The Simpsons busted out this quote it was incredibly ahead of its time .
2 | On the Patriot Act
Lisa : Ralph is only eight years old !
It says in the Constitution , you have to be 35 [ to be President ] !
Bart : The Constitution ?
I ’m pretty sure the Patriot Act killed it to ensure our freedoms .
Homer : [ mockingly ]
Ooh , the Patriot Act is so terrible !
The government might find out what library books I take out !
What ’s next , finding out what operas I go to ?
[ Homer and Bart high - five ]
Oh my God !
Someone on the Internet just quoted a Simpsons episode made in the last eight years !
Quick , hit the Independent Thought Alert button .
( And by the way , even if The Simpsons is more past its prime than Jamie Moyer , that quote is amazing . )
3 | On the legislative system
Kent Brockman :
With our utter annihilation imminent , our federal government has snapped into action .
We go live now via satellite to the floor of the United States Congress .
Speaker :
Then it is unanimous , we are going to approve the bill to evacuate the town of Springfield in the great state of —
Congressman :
Wait a minute , I want to tack on a rider to that bill : $ 30 million of taxpayer money to support the perverted arts .
Speaker :
All in favor of the amended Springfield - slash - pervert bill ?
Everyone : BOOOO !
Speaker : Bill defeated .
Kent : I ’ve said it before and I ’ll say it again : Democracy simply does n’t work .
I do n’t know .
I kinda wish some of my tax dollars were going to support the perverted arts .
Might as well teach the kids something that can help them compete with the Japanese .
4 | On the American attention span
Homer :
Do you want the job done right or do you want it done fast ?
Marge : Well , like all Americans … fast !
It ’s the exact reason the public appreciates — nay , demands — that Kevin Costner step in with his quick solution to this oil spill .
5 | On bipartisanship
Kang : ( having taken over Bob Dole ’s body ) Abortions for all .
Crowd : BOOOO !
Kang :
Very well , no abortions for anyone .
Crowd : BOOOO !
Kang : Hmm … abortions for some , miniature American flags for others !
Crowd : [ cheers and waves miniature flags ]
Quite possibly the most succinct summary of America ’s two political parties ever .
6 | On American ego
Colby : Okay Homer , I do n’t know anything about planes , but I know about you .
You have what made America great : no understanding of the limits of your power and a complete lack of concern for what anyone thinks of you .
So you ’ll land that plane .
And do you know why ?
Because I heard some guy say you could n’t .
Homer : What !
I ’ll show him .
I ’ll show that guy !
You ’ve probably never seen the episode containing this quote ( it ’s another one from the past few years ) — but it ’s a quality quote .
( Much like Mayor Quimby believes “ au gratin potatoes ” are a quality side . )
I like the American part of it , but I think I ’m even more into the part about doing something because “ some guy [ said ] you could n’t . ”
That ’s just about the best motivational tactic there is .
7 | On Republican leadership
Sideshow Bob :
Your guilty conscience may move you to vote Democratic , but deep down you long for a cold - hearted Republican to lower taxes , brutalize criminals , and rule you like a king .
That ’s why I did this , to save you from yourselves .
With the way the parties keep trading off presidents , this means we should be in line for a king in two or six years .
Rather than fight it , just spend the next few years trying to make sure you ’re not so poor by the time he takes the throne .
( That ’s my plan .
So far it ’s … not going so well . )
8 | On imperialism
Brazilian lifeguard : Excuse me , Americans !
Homer : Ah !
How did you know ?
[ he turns to reveal a t - shirt that shows Uncle Sam biting the globe with the phrase “ TRY AND STOP US ” ]
Grammatical issue aside , I ’m pretty sure that ’s the best t- shirt anyone ’s ever worn on The Simpsons .
The episode where Bart produced t- shirts was n’t that great .
I liked the Pin Pals shirts and I ’d wear one , but they ’re not this good .
Rod or Todd Flanders misinterpreting a Butthole Surfers band shirt is n’t bad .
I have to be missing some amazing ones , right ?
9 | On health care
Homer : ( before his triple bypass ) : America ’s health care system is second only to Japan , Canada , Sweden , Great Britain , well … all of Europe .
But you can thank your lucky stars we do n’t live in Paraguay !
This is going to sound boorishly American — but other than this quote and the World Cup game I watched this morning , I ’m pretty sure I do n’t know anything else about Paraguay .
Is it like Uruguay with no arms or legs ?
10 | On the American work ethic
Homer :
If you do n’t like your job , you do n’t go on strike .
You just go in every day and do it really half - assed – that ’s the American way .
Now , yes , I used this quote on a previous list .
But it ’s so perfect I could n’t exclude it .
Plus I did n’t include the “ that ’s the American way ” part last time I used it .
So I ’m just re-appropriating it here .
Is that half - assed of me ?
Sure .
Irony rules !
11 | On July 4th
Convenience store clerk : Celebrate the independence of your nation by blowing up a small part of it .
—
Have a great July 4th !
Salute those lucky 13 stripes and 47 stars .
And be careful — remember , this is the second - most dangerous holiday for driving .

In Sicily , where the relationship between the living and the dead has always been strong , the city of Palermo hosts one of the world ’s more bizarre and morbid tourist attractions .
Through the doors of the Capuchin Monastery , which looks like any other building from the outside , visitors can descend into the large Capuchin catacombs .
Pinned to the walls , sitting on benches and shelves and tucked away in open coffins are nearly 8,000 corpses , each one dressed in their Sunday best .
In most of Western culture , the long - dead are generally kept out of sight , hidden from the living .
Here , it is the exception .
Nothing stands between the living and dead , except maybe a rope with a sign asking visitors to be respectful .
The ill - lit , musty catacombs have been separated into a few corridors , each one hosting a specific type of person .
There is a room for religious figures , mainly those affiliated with the monastery , for professionals , such as doctors , and a room for women , virgins and infants .
The oldest corpse in the macabre collection is that of Silvestro da Gubbio , a friar who passed in 1599 .
It is believed that the particularly dry atmosphere allowed for the natural mummification of the bodies .
Initially , priests would lay the dead on shelves and allow them to drip until they were completely depleted of bodily fluids .
A full year later , the dried - out corpse would be rinsed with vinegar before being re-dressed in their best attire and sent to their proper room , to stand for eternity .
One of the most recent to be interred was Rosalia Lombardo , only two years old when she was embalmed in 1920 .
The embalming procedure has kept Rosalia looking so well preserved that she has been dubbed “ Sleeping Beauty . ”
The embalming procedure , which was lost for decades , consists of “ formalin to kill bacteria , alcohol to dry the body , glycerin to keep her from overdrying , salicylic acid to kill fungi , and the most important ingredient , zinc salts to give the body rigidity . ”
Great powers and empires operate somewhere between order and disorder .
They can appear to operate quite stably for some time ; they seem to be in equilibrium but are , in fact , constantly adapting .
But a small trigger can set off a ' ' phase transition ' ' from a benign equilibrium to a crisis - a butterfly flaps its wings in the Amazon and brings about a hurricane in south - eastern England .
Regardless of whether it is a dictatorship or a democracy , any large - scale political unit is a complex system .
Most great empires have a nominal central authority - either a hereditary emperor or an elected president - but in practice the power of any individual ruler is a function of the network of economic , social and political relations over which he or she presides .
As such , empires exhibit many of the characteristics of other complex adaptive systems - including the tendency to move from stability to instability quite suddenly .
But this fact is rarely recognised because of our addiction to cyclical theories of history .
The Bourbon monarchy in France passed from triumph to terror with astonishing rapidity .
French intervention on the side of the colonial rebels against British rule in North America in the 1770s seemed like a chance for revenge after Great Britain 's victory in the Seven Years
War a decade earlier , but it served to tip France into a critical state .
In May 1789 , the summoning of the Estates - General , France 's long - dormant representative assembly , unleashed a political chain reaction that led to a swift collapse of royal legitimacy in France .
Only four years later , in January 1793 , Louis XVI was decapitated by guillotine .
The sun set on the British Empire almost as suddenly .
So , what are the implications for the United States today ?
The most obvious point is that imperial falls are associated with fiscal crises - sharp imbalances between revenues and expenditures , and the mounting cost of servicing a mountain of public debt .
Think of Ottoman Turkey in the 19th century : debt service rose from 17 per cent of revenue in 1868 to 32 per cent in 1871 to 50 per cent in 1877 , two years after the great default that ushered in the disintegration of the Ottoman Empire in the Balkans .
Consider Britain in the 20th century .
By the mid 1920s , debt charges were absorbing 44.5 per cent of total government expenditure , exceeding defence expenditure every year until 1937 , when rearmament finally got under way in earnest .
But Britain 's real problems came after 1945 , when a substantial proportion of its immense debt burden - equivalent to about a third of gross domestic product - was in foreign hands .
Alarm bells should therefore be ringing loudly in Washington , as the US contemplates a deficit for 2010 of more than $ US1.47 trillion - about 10 per cent of gross domestic product , for the second year running .
Since 2001 , in the space of just 10 years , the US federal debt in public hands has doubled as a share of GDP from 32 per cent to a projected 66 per cent next year .
It is projected that debt could reach 344 per cent by 2050 .
These sums may sound fantastic .
But more terrifying is to consider what continuing deficit finance could mean for the burden of interest payments as a share of federal revenues - up to 85 per cent in 2050 .
The fiscal position of the US is worse than that of Greece .
But Greece is not a global power .
In historical perspective , unless something radical is done soon , the US is heading into into Bourbon France territory .
It is heading into Ottoman Turkey territory .
It is heading into postwar Britain territory .
For now , the world still expects the US to muddle through , eventually confronting its problems when , as Winston Churchill famously said , all the alternatives have been exhausted .
With the sovereign debt crisis in Europe combining with growing fears of a deflationary double - dip recession , bond yields are at historic lows .
There is therefore a strong incentive for those in the US Congress to put off fiscal reform .
Remember , half the US federal debt in public hands is in the hands of foreign creditors .
Of that , a fifth ( 22 per cent ) is held by the monetary authorities of the People 's Republic of China , down from 27 per cent in July last year .
China now has the second - largest economy in the world and is almost certain to be America 's principal strategic rival this century , particularly in the Asia - Pacific region .
Quietly , discreetly , the Chinese are reducing their exposure to US Treasury bonds .
Perhaps they have noticed what the rest of the world 's investors pretend not to see - that the US is on an unsustainable fiscal course , with no apparent political means of self - correcting .

That has profound implications not only for the US , but also for all countries that have come to rely on it , directly or indirectly , for their security .

Recessions are common ; depressions are rare .
As far as I can tell , there were only two eras in economic history that were widely described as “ depressions ” at the time : the years of deflation and instability that followed the Panic of 1873 and the years of mass unemployment that followed the financial crisis of 1929 - 31 .
Neither the Long Depression of the 19th century nor the Great Depression of the 20th was an era of nonstop decline  on the contrary , both included periods when the economy grew .
But these episodes of improvement were never enough to undo the damage from the initial slump , and were followed by relapses .
We are now , I fear , in the early stages of a third depression .
It will probably look more like the Long Depression than the much more severe Great Depression .
But the cost  to the world economy and , above all , to the millions of lives blighted by the absence of jobs  will nonetheless be immense .
And this third depression will be primarily a failure of policy .
Around the world  most recently at last weekend ’s deeply discouraging G - 20 meeting  governments are obsessing about inflation when the real threat is deflation , preaching the need for belt - tightening when the real problem is inadequate spending .
Opening the files is not unprecedented .
Last year , Britain published 4,000 pages online on 800 alleged encounters with aliens during the 1980s and 1990s .
And over the past three years the Ministry of Defence has been gradually releasing previously secret UFO papers after facing Freedom of Information demands .
One month after the Denver debut of B - cycle , the first large - scale bike sharing program in the U.S. , over 3,000 Denver residents have burned over 1.3 million calories by pedaling away at the 400 bikes docked at 42 stations around the city .
That ’s according to Amadeus
Consulting , the Boulder , Colorado neighbor of B - cycle creators Crispin Porter +
Bogusky who develop the integrated technology for the system that tracks usage through a kiosk user interface , Web services , and an iPhone application .
The iPhone app , which launched last week , has had about 600 downloads out of a total of just over 3,000 members ( users have to pay a membership fee ranging from $ 5 for 24 - hour use to $ 65 annual passes , on top of hourly rental fees to be able to borrow the bikes ) .
The app can be used to locate and unlock bikes around the city and monitors time , mileage , and calories burned based on trip distance .
It also reports the reduction in
carbon emissions achieved by biking rather than driving and allows
members to connect with each other through Facebook and Twitter .
Users can go on the B - cycle Web site at any time to monitor their accounts in more detail .
The technology also helps Denver Bike Sharing , a nonprofit that manages the service , to make sure bikes are readily available throughout the city .
According to a DBS spokesperson , the perfect ratio of bikes to spaces is 2/3 full to 1/3 empty .
DBS monitors the ratios throughout the day , but should those numbers become too uneven , the team employs a radically low - tech solution :
They deploy riders to go and shuffle the bikes .
And even though B - cycle bikes have a built - in honesty policy –they ’ll charge your account a whopping $ 1,000 if it does n’t get returned within three days –the bikes are also equipped with trackable RFID tags which act like GPSes to prevent theft .
I ’ve always loved Container Gardening .
I think it might have started when I was about 10 , getting totally obsessed with rooting an avocado pit by putting toothpicks into it , elevating it over water and then planting it .
It actually grew into a small tree that I had for many years in a container .
These days I am a totally self admitted , full fledged “ Container Freak ! ” I will try any type of plant / combination and have found that there really are n’t too many things that you ca n’t grow in a container .
The possibilities are endless .
Add in the benefit that a beautiful container can be created in a very short period of time and except for watering , there ’s usually not a lot of maintenance or weeding .
Oh and for the impatient souls amongst us , including myself …
I do n’t know of too many gardening projects that can provide such “ instant gratification ” .
Container Gardens come in all shapes and sizes .
They can be simple single specimens or more elaborate combinations of various colors , textures and shapes .
Trees can adapt well to containers and it's easy and rewarding to grow luscious fruits and vegetables .
Container Gardening is also very easy .
You really do n’t need much to get started and even the self proclaimed “ I have a black thumb ” plant murderer can create a beautiful container with a little knowledge .
It can also be a gardening solution for persons affected by Arthritis or other conditions limiting movement , and at the right level can even be performed from a chair .
Even if you travel frequently and do n’t have the time for regular watering , you can still enjoy this type of gardening .
There are many self - watering planters on the market as well as soil additives and watering systems which will keep your gardens healthy and thriving while you ’re away .
Now if space is a limitation , then container gardening is definitely for you .
Even the smallest balcony can be transformed into a paradise with a little creativity .
With so many choices these days of space saving , hanging and stackable planters , an Oasis is totally achievable in a confined space .
If you ’re worried about Sun exposure or lack of it , there ’s an appropriate container plant for every location .
Gardening in planters can also be very liberating from your locale .
Although a short season , how else could it be possible to grow a Palm tree in Alaska or other loved tropical ’s in Northern States ?
With good potting blends , it can be a welcome escape from gardening in poor soils or clay , or in my case bad fill dirt and sand .
F L E X I B I L I T Y
The word that really says it all is – flexibility !
If you get tired of the look , just change your pots around for a fresh new landscape !
( do n’t water first – I ’ve made that mistake many times ! ) .
In mixed planters , if some plants have declined or outgrown their season … just pop in a new one and change the entire look .
Bring them inside for the winter , put them back outside for the summer .
Add a touch of whimsy , have fun and experiment !
Oh , and by the way !
You also do n’t have to spend a lot of money on planters .
Basically you can use almost anything for a container - A pail with some holes drilled in the bottom , inexpensive finds from a Yard sale or something you found along side the road .
You would be surprised what you may come up with !
“ Think outside the Pot ! ”
As long as you have decent drainage , you ’re in good shape !
And talking about drainage !
hehe
Container Gardening is a way to express your personality .
Whether you like things “ colorful and bold ” or “ demure and elegant ” or maybe you just want to pick some fresh herbs - there ’s a container creation for everybody !
Just have Fun !
Have some of your photos ever been ruined by strangers ?

Even though you might deny it , it wo n’t change the fact that you live in a world created by marketers .
Advertising is a powerful force that had shaped our attitudes and behavior since the early 19th - century when it got into newspapers , and the early 1940s when it got into television .
With great power comes great responsibility , but try telling that to someone working in the advertising field in the early 20th century .
Even today , advertising does n’t try very hard to conform to moral standards , but after looking back at some offensive , racist , sexist and over - the - top funny ads – today ’s commercials are as good as gold .
Besides being sexist ads , they were also full of lies promoting unhealthy habits .
Interesting fact – the first vintage ad to use a sexual sell was created by a woman for soap as early as 1911 .
The campaign was so successful , that the slogan “ A Skin You Love To Touch ” was used until the 1940s .
Whether we like it or not , it is a piece of history worth seeing for everyone .
Enjoy these offensive vintage ads and banned commercials and do take them lightheartedly .

Underwater search teams are a familiar sight during major police investigations .
But what is it like to make a living probing the country 's murkiest recesses ?
Submerged in darkness , chilled in near - frozen water , you grope your way through the silt and debris .
Somewhere , amid the sludge and the discarded rubbish , is your quarry : a knife , a gun or a body .
With colleagues on dry land depending on you , how on earth do you find what you are looking for ?
For the UK's army of police divers , patrolling rivers , canals and seas is a daily challenge .
WHAT'S A DRY SUIT ?
Worn by police divers
Unlike a wet suit , prevents water reaching the skin Needed due to risk of poisonous liquid and polluted water
The sight of officers in dry suits and breathing apparatus has been a familiar sight on TV news bulletins during the recent triple murder inquiry in Bradford , the search for missing chef Claudia Lawrence and the Milly Dowler probe .
Often searching at night and in cold weather , officers invariably have to contend with nil - visibility conditions , weeds , mud and refuse .
Methodically sweeping the search area to ensure no inch is missed , they have to contend with tides , frequently inclement weather and the challenge of constantly maintaining concentration .
One officer who has to contend with these challenges on a daily basis is Sgt Steve Howe , 39 , who has served with Northumbria Police 's Marine Unit for eight years .
If you 're claustrophobic , it 's definitely not for you
Sgt Steve Howe
Although he had to undergo a rigorous eight - week training programme before he could join the unit , followed by regular mandatory refresher courses , Sgt Howe admits that nothing could have prepared him for the murky reality of Tyneside and Wearside 's hidden depths .
" If you 're claustrophobic , it 's definitely not for you , " he says .
" About 90 % of the time you have absolutely no visibility .
You 've always got the danger of entanglement .
" And let 's face it , it is n't very pleasant when you 're called out at 3 am in February . "
Nonetheless , Sgt Howe loves his job , taking great satisfaction from the fact that a breakthrough discovery can make the difference between a murder investigation foundering or progressing .
How police search underwater Several divers swim together in formation , joined by a line held by an officer on the bank Diver swims in arc - on reaching bank , 1 m of line is released , diver swims in arc further out Diver searches to end of line , then moves a weight forward 1 m and searches back diagonally BACK {current} of {total} NEXT " It sounds strange , but I always feel most proud when I find a deceased , " he says .
" Otherwise , the family would n't have a body - they can draw a line under it . "
As well as searches of rivers , canals and the sea , officers in the unit perform counter - terror security sweeps and searches of confined spaces such as culverts and drains .
When they are submerged , each diver has a full face mask with a lifeline - a cable which means the officers on the surface know exactly where the divers are .
For safety reasons , there are always fewer divers in the water than on the surface .
For the Northumbria force , four officers from the diving unit will be above ground for each one underwater .
Nonetheless , the job is always going to be an intricate and dangerous one , with the diver constantly having to be wary of the danger of entanglement .
Swim in a skip
One officer who manages to take it in his stride is Sgt Stewart Kennedy , 43 , who has served with the Metropolitan Police 's Marine Policing Unit for 11 of his 17 years with the force .
The unit 's Underwater and Confined Spaces Search Team carries out about 250 searches each year , spending on average 55 % of their time diving , 25 % wading and 20 % in confined spaces .
TO BE A POLICE DIVER Officers must serve two years before specialising Some are recreational divers before joining , many are not Must complete eight - week intensive course and regular refreshers " I actually find it very relaxing - when you 're under water , all the weight is taken off you , " Sgt Kennedy laughs .
But as one of nine divers with the unit , the conditions he can be called in to endure 24 hours a day are a long way from what most people would consider soothing .
" The way I 'd describe London 's canal system - which is our bread and butter - is imagine a very large skip that anybody can throw rubbish into , and then fill it up with water , " Sgt Kennedy adds .
" Hypodermic needles , builders ' rubble , traffic cones - everything you can imagine is down there .
Because you can't see , you 're doing fingertip searches , and you learn to recognise everything by touch . "
Still , the Met 's underwater officers can at least rely on an arsenal of sophisticated kit , from two - way communications equipment which allows them to talk to colleagues on the surface , to dinghies and fast response boats .
It is all a long way from the not - too - distant past , as retired Devon and Cornwall officer Dave Peake recalls .
In the 1950s , divers - then called frogmen - used primitive equipment
He spent 15 of his 31 years in the force from 1968 as a police diver - or , as he was initially described , a " frogman " .
At first there was no standing underwater unit , as today - so Mr Peake would serve as an ordinary Pc working the beat out of his local station , but could be dispatched at any time along the 600 miles of coastline that surrounded the constabulary .
" It 's amazing what they have access to today - the equipment has really come on , " he says .
" We did n't even have safety lines back then - you had to make your way through the water in nil visibility without them .
" All the same , it 's a hugely rewarding task - I 'm very proud of what we did and I still go diving at 66 . "
The job description may have been transformed , but demand for underwater officers is not likely to go away any time soon .
Beneath the surface , the search goes on .
Below is a selection of your comments .
These officers are indeed doing a splendid job in terrible conditions , they deserve all the credit they receive .
John Grundy , Barnard Castle , County Durham , England Nil visibility ?
They do n't give the divers water - proof lights for searches ?
Craig Newman , Cardiff Craig - there is a huge difference to having nil visibility and no light .
Silt , debris and even rain fall can stir the particles in the water meaning you cannot even see your hand in front of your face .
Imagine looking through a muddy puddle and trying to see the bottom - no amount of light will make any difference .
Kate , Berkshire Nil visibility means exactly that - not just dark .
Try comparing it to a very thick fog , then you 're only half way there .
What good are torches ?
During my diver training one police diver told me his team had to search a cess pit .
Hilary , Manchester
They do have waterproof lights , but when the water is extremely murky it 's like turning your car 's main beam on in thick fog .
The light can't penetrate the water and just blinds you .
Peter Wright , Brent Knoll , UK
On my Army divers aptitude test we were taught to feel your way around because as soon as you hit the silt visibility is zero .
A lot of engineer tasks carried out underwater are carried out in limited or zero visibility including setting explosives and using compressed air tools .
Neville George , Frodsham , Cheshire I 'm a recreational diver , so I 'm not in anywhere near the same class as the brave people mentioned in this article .
But , from my own experiences of diving in some of the UK 's lakes and rivers , I can tell you that having a torch wo n't make the slightest bit of difference to the visibility down there .
It is not a question of light , but simply that the shear amount of silt and soil that is churned - up by the currents literally form a thick cloud that you cannot see beyond ...
At some points , I could n't even see my hand when I held it up in front of my facemask - this was midday in July , when it was very sunny .
I can appreciate the immensely difficult task that these guys have to deal with everyday .
As for me , I will be keeping my UK dives to a minimum .
Ben , Leicester , UK Great story .
A job I 'd half love and half hate .
I 'm thinking there 's the potential for a short documentary / reality series on police divers instead of more about police traffic police , helicopter medics etc .
How about it ?
Steve , Lymington Steve , there has been such a documentary .
It was called River Police ( I think ) .
Not sure I 'd ever want to go into a London canal , even with all the safety equipment .
Chris , London
This is a very dangerous and difficult job for anyone to do .
I have a friend who was a police diver in the 1980s and he told some awful stories so I think they all deserve more reward for their services to the communities in which they work .
Robin Bailey , Kendal , United Kingdom
Having been on event where junk was pulled out the canal with grapnels , all I can say is that anyone who goes in that water deserves a lot of respect .

U.S. Republicans and Democrats differ on nearly every issue in the U.S. Congress but are united in their support of Israel , Congressman Eric Cantor ( R - VA ) told a congregation of U.S. Jews on Saturday .
Speaking at The Hampton Synagogue in Long Island , the Republican minority whip characterized the current U.S. Congress as one of the most divided in recent memory .

But despite its many differences with regard to foreign and domestic matters , said Cantor , the Congress stands united on one issue : support for Israel and its vital interests .
Cantor , who is the highest ranking Jewish member in the Republican Party , attended the synagogue as a guest of Rabbi Marc Schneier .
Chief Rabbi of Israel Yona Metzger was also present for the Sabbath services .
Cantor was honored during the service with a call to the Torah and delivered his address to hundreds of worshipers .

So Groovy , It'll Take You Back To The 60's
Product coming from a well , a pump or a skimmer is very commonly all jumbled up .
This is what is called three - phase flow -- the three unseparated phases being gas , oil and water .
Water is easy .
Gas and oil will change phases readily with changes in temperature .
For the purposes of my explanations here , we 'll be separating the gas and oil at the temperatures we receive them .
There are several means of separation .
In the oil and gas industry ( as well as most other industries or applications ) our primary tool is gravity .
Next comes collision .
Temperature is also used , but we wo n't address that here ... much if at all .
The most important variable with gravity separation is retention time .
Gravity will cause liquids to sink , heavier liquids to sink more , and gasses to float to the top .
Retention time is the amount of time we allow for gravity to do its work .
A water glass is a separator .
When you fill it at your kitchen sink , you 're separating water and air .
Try filling it with the nozzle on your garden hose .
Not enough retention time !
retention time : the average amount of time between molecules of gas oil or water entering the separation vessel and leaving it .
For any given vessel ( separator ) , gas , oil and water will each have their own retention times .
To illustrate retention time , however , let 's not talk about petroleum products or water , let 's talk about people lining up for rides at the Daily Kos Amusement Park ( Havana , Cuba ) .
Because the Great Orange Satan Coaster is one of the busier rides at the Daily Kos Park , we 've had to arrange one of those serpentine queue thingys .
You 'll see these at amusement parks and nowdays , at airports .
These things are where you find yourself staring at the same boobs over and over and having the same undisciplined children ( future GOP Senators ) climb all over your luggage and make faces at you .
Here 's the Great Satan Coaster queue on a weekday ( low pressure ) .
-
-
Remember , we 're not talking about separation right now .
Just retention time .
It 's not a busy day at the Great Orange Satan ride , so people can maintain a little space between themselves .
Retention time here is the average time between a person entering the queue on the right and leaving it on the left .
What about on weekends when the Great Satan ride gets a lot more riders ?
What if we want to increase the number of people in the queue , without adding rows to the queue ?
We increase the pressure .
We decrease the distance between people in the queue -- but we increase the retention time .
There 's only so many cars on the Great Orange Satan Coaster and the ride takes a fixed time .
-
-
So increasing pressure increases retention time !
What if we want to increase retention time , without increasing pressure ?
-
-
We add more rows .
We increase our separator size .
Here 's a real ( but simplified ) 3 - phase separator :
-
-
Okay , forget about the serpetine queue stuff , that was just a discussion of retention time .
Now we 've moved on to actual separation , using , primarily , gravity .
The only things in this picture that might not be self - explanatory , are the level controllers .
Look inside your toilet tank .
That 's a level controller .
The level controllers in an oil and gas separator control dump valves , one each on the oil and water outlet lines .
This is a horizontal separator .
Horizontal separators are good for oil wells , because they can handle more liquids without carrying over .
Vertical separators are better for gas wells , because they 're capable of separating a lighter oil ( think lighter than gasoline ) without carrying over .
Carrying over is when the mixed up , foamy , splashy part on the right of this picture moves far enough to the left to be carried out the gas outlet .
This happens when your separator is too small or you 're not holding enough pressure .
It happens because of a lack of retention time .
If you open a bottle of Diet Coke and leave it to go flat , you 're separating ( CO2 and water , basically ) .
If you drop the bottle of Diet Coke on the floor and then open it , you 're carrying over .
Looking at the picture ( above ) of a 3 - phase separator , you can see that the lower right is the water area , the lower left is the oil area and the upper third if the cylinder is the gas area .
Let 's say we know our well is going to make more water and this is for a permanent installation .
We would move the liquid baffle to the left , giving us more water retention time .
More oil ?
we move the liquid baffle to the right .
But what if it 's temporary , like our present situation , and we just have to take what we can get -- generic separators like this one .
What are our means of increasing retention time , generally ?
We can increase the pressure , usually by partially closing a backpressure valve , located on the gas outlet line .
BUT !
This will cause backpressure on the cap atop the BOP ( old # 4 ) and allow us to collect less oil .
If we increase pressure as our means of increasing retention time , we wo n't be taking everything our seafloor configuration will give us !
WE CAN INCREASE OUR SEPARATOR SIZE !
Or , get more separators !
With what 's a stake here , we can get more separators than we need .
We could have a month ago .
Right now , they 're holding about 1000 psig backpressure at the boat , against the flow from the top of the BOP .
To separate and process , with adequate separation ( retention time ! ) they only need to hold about 120 psig .
They could be capturing most or all of what is leaking up and around # 4 and has been leaking ever since they placed the cap there in the first place .
Why BP Are A Bunch Of Fuckers Here
If you do n't separate , you cannot legally measure gas or oil .
The estimates from the quasi-official Flow Rate Technical Group will not stand up in court .
BP knows this .
Our Government knows this .
Anything still leaking into the Gulf of Mexico up to the instant they kill the well ( which could be soon ) is negotiable .
Once that negotiation starts , we will be measuring the efficacy of expert witnesses , lawyers and judge - shopping .
We will NOT be measuring the amount of oil that has been spilling into the Gulf of Mexico for 80 fucking goddamned days now .
Everytime you hear of another delay in capturing , separating and measuring ALL the oil leaking into the Gulf , remember that .
Anything still leaking into the Gulf of Mexico up to the instant they kill the well is negotiable .
It makes every drop of oil they 've leaked and not measured ...
NEGOTIABLE !
Oh , by the way , the oil and gas they 're burning on the Q4000 ?
That 's not separated or properly measured .
That 's an estimate too .
That 's negotiable .
Up until June 6th , I thought perhaps BP was stalling or incompetent .
I wrote a diary about it on June 7th .
Now it 's July 8th .
A month .
I no longer suspect incompetence .
I suspect stalling .
I suspect collusion .
I suspect fraud .
24 hours of true separation and measurement is the standard definition of an allocation test -- one that will stand up in court .
If BP does not capture ALL the oil and gas from this leak for at least one 24 - hour period , separate it and measure it , before the well is killed , Congress MUST subpoena everyone involved and have them testify under oath as to why that did not occur .
If we can't nail BP for every drop of oil , let 's nail them for something else .
Who knew what when -- who said what to who ?
Who stalled ?
Why ?
They can't say it was n't possible .
It was VERY possible .
Liquid Separation : Costner and A Whale
Okay , this part has nothing to do with legal measurement of product .
Here we 're talking about what to do with what the skimmers collect .
Pumpers have been doing this since there have been oil wells .
You pump or produce into one tank while allowing the other to settle and drain water .
-
-
Then you switch tanks .
Once you 've got both tanks , say 70 % full and holding mostly oil , it 's time to ship oil .
As you can see from the left - hand tank , it is possible in some situations to be draining water ( at the rate you 're producing it ) from the same tank you 're producing into .
Now , granted , the water you 're draining may have a little oil in it .
Presently , the EPA demands that water drained back into the Gulf , be lower than 15 ppm oil .
I think they demand that .
I cannot find out .
I 've asked them if they 've waived that rule and they wo n't say .
They wo n't say they have n't made the decision yet , as they know I could come back with ,
" It 's been 80 fucking goddamned days !
When do you think you might make that decision ? "
The EPA just wo n't say anything .
They 'll refer you to the Unified Command , who will refer you right back to the EPA ... but they wo n't say shit about shit .
Big goddamned National Security secret .
Why is it important ?
Presently , the only data we 've gotten from the testing of Costner 's machines tells us those machines get the water down to 80 ppm oil .
That 's with a lot of other non-Costner process upstream .
A
Whale , the large foreign - flagged tanker they 've been testing probably only gets the water down to 300 ppm or so .
Just using tanks , as in the picture above ( or a tanker , for that matter ) , anyone could get the oil in the water down to about 1500 ppm by just using settling time and draining the water .
10,000 ppm is 1 %
If they would just change the rule , just for this cleanup , to say that any at - sea process must remove and store 90 % of the oil taken in before expelling water , no argument could be made that anything more exotic than a tank with a drain valve is needed .
Everyone knows the guys on the barges have been making room by draining water .
They 're trying to help clean up an oil spill ... a big one .
Why make them criminals ?
The whole idea of skimming is to get as much oil off the water you can , before that oil makes it to shore .
It 's like you have 6000 acres of wheat to get in before a big rain - storm .
You skip the field corners and weed patches .
You put the combine harvester in high gear , knowing that is going to miss a few percent more of the wheat .
If some ridiulous rule is resulting in more oil hitting the shore , that 's a problem , and the people who made that rule should have to answer for it .
OR .... is at - sea separation even that important ?
All this liquid goes to the bad oil tanks at refineries and processing plants .
Those can handle ANY amount of water .
The skimmers themselves unload to barges and tankers at sea .
Has there been a problem ?
Has there been a lack of tankers and barges ?
Have any skimmers had to stop work because they have nowhere to unload at - sea ?
If not , if tankers heading ashore with 80 % water is n't a bottleneck in the process , then there 's no reason whatsoever for the EPA to waive the 15 ppm rule .
If that 's so , then Costner 's machines are doing essentially nothing as well .
So . News Media !
Here 's your questions :
Has there been a lack of tankers and barges ?
Have any skimmers had to stop work because they have nowhere to unload at - sea ?
Is the lack of at - sea oil / water separation a problem for the skimming operations ?
At all ?
Has the EPA waived or adjusted the 15 ppm rule ?
Do they even need to ?
Is all of this a big goddamn secret ?
Why ?

WASHINGTON —
It was strike two for a major science funding bill yesterday as House Republicans again united to derail legislation they said was too expensive .
Going down to defeat was legislation that would have committed more than $ 40 billion over three years to boost funding for the National Science Foundation and other federal agencies involved in basic and applied science , provided loan guarantees to small businesses developing new technologies , and promoted science and math education .
Congress enacted a first version of the legislation in 2007 with a large majority in the House and a unanimous vote in the Senate .
But in this election year , with Republicans out to show their antispending credentials , things are different .
Republicans support science research , said Representative Ralph Hall of Texas , top Republican on the Science and Technology Committee .
But the Democratic bill “ continues to take us in a much more costly direction and authorizes a number of new programs which have little to do with prioritizing investments ’’ in science and technology .
Committee chairman Bart Gordon , a Tennessee Democrat , said he had made a “ sincere attempt to compromise ’’ with Republicans on a bill he said was essential to reversing trends over the past two decades where the United States has been losing its technological edge to other countries .
Last week Republicans forced Democrats to pull the bill from the floor by pushing through an amendment that combined substantial cuts to many of the main initiatives in the bill with a provision cracking down on federal workers caught viewing pornography on their office computers .
Many Democrats , fearful that a vote against an antipornography measure could be used against them , went along with the GOP amendment .
The legislation presented yesterday restored the programs the Republicans tried to kill but reduced to three years , rather than five , the life of the measure , thus cutting the original $ 85 billion price tag to about $ 47 billion .
It also included the anti-pornography provision .
But Democrats made a losing gamble by bringing the bill up under a procedure that prevented Republicans from offering more amendments but requiring a two - thirds majority for passage .
The vote was 261 to 148 for passage , short of the two - thirds needed .
Every Democrat supported it , but only 15 of 163 voting Republicans backed it .
House majority leader Steny Hoyer , Democrat of Maryland , said in a statement that he was “ extremely disappointed Republicans continued to play political games , voting against a job - creating measure that had bipartisan support . ’’
He said he planned to bring the bill back to the floor soon under normal rules requiring only a majority for passage .
Lawmakers make push to regulate online gambling WASHINGTON — Prohibition did n’t work with alcohol and it ’s not working with Internet gambling now , say lawmakers pushing Congress to approve long - shot legislation that would legalize and tax online wagering .
WASHINGTON — Prohibition did n’t work with alcohol and it ’s not working with Internet gambling now , say lawmakers pushing Congress to approve long - shot legislation that would legalize and tax online wagering .
Representative Jim McDermott , Democrat of Washington , told his colleagues during a congressional hearing yesterday that millions of Americans gamble on the Internet each day , despite laws to prevent it .
Citing industry analysts , McDermott said they wager nearly $ 100 billion annually , generating an estimated $ 5 billion for offshore operators .
He said the money would be put to better use in the United States and would create thousands of jobs for people who would be employed by licensed gambling sites .
“ Regulation and taxation have proven to be a better policy for our country when it comes to alcohol , ’’ McDermott said .
“ The same is true for online gambling . ’’
Realistically , supporters realize that Congress is highly unlikely to pass legislation this year on the subject , but they hope to lay the groundwork for the future with hearings like the one yesterday before the House Ways and Means Committee .
While McDermott ’s bill would provide for taxing Internet gambling , companion legislation from Representative Barney Frank , a Massachusetts Democrat , would license and regulate the industry .
The Treasury Department would be tasked with licensing operators that meet financial requirements and pass criminal background checks .
Frank ’s legislation prohibits the operators from accepting sports bets as well as bets initiated in states or tribal lands that prohibit that particular type of Internet gambling .
It has drawn support from online poker players .

With Watchmen ’s Dr Manhattan , Rorschach and friends , Alan Moore created superheroes who defined an era , but the comic book legend has said that he is now over the superhero genre .
Speaking to London music newspaper the Stool Pigeon , Moore said that although he was “ interested in the superhero in real life ” , pointing to the “ interesting number ” of protestors these days who dress as V , the mask - wearing protagonist of his graphic novel V for Vendetta , he is no longer attracted to the comic - book version .
“ I ’ve had some distancing thoughts about them recently .
I ’ve come to the conclusion that what superheroes might be – in their current incarnation , at least – is a symbol of American reluctance to involve themselves in any kind of conflict without massive tactical superiority , ” Moore said .
“ I think this is the same whether you have the advantage of carpet bombing from altitude or if you come from the planet Krypton as a baby and have increased powers in Earth ’s lower gravity . ”
The graphic novelist said that , when he was a child , superheroes represented “ a wellspring of the imagination ” .
“ Superman had a dog in a cape !
He had a city in a bottle !
It was wonderful stuff for a seven - year - old boy to think about , ” Moore explained .
“ But I suspect that a lot of superheroes now are basically about the unfair fight .
You know : people would n’t bully me if I could turn into the Hulk . ”
His comments echo a line in Watchmen , when a character says that “ back in ‘ 39 , before the real masked men showed up , superhero comics were enormous .
Guess their appeal wore off ... ”
Quick Guide
The five Alan Moore comics you must read Show V for Vendetta ( 1982 - 1989 )
This dystopian graphic novel continues to be relevant even 30 years after it ended .
With its warnings against fascism , white supremacy and the horrors of a police state , V for Vendetta follows one woman and a revolutionary anarchist on a campaign to challenge and change the world .
Superman : Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow ( 1986 ) Moore 's quintessential Superman story .
Though it has not aged as well as some of his work , this comic is still one of the best Man of Steel stories ever written , and one of the most memorable comics in DC 's canon .
A Small Killing ( 1991 )
This introspective , stream - of - consciousness comic follows a successful ad man who begins to have a midlife crisis after realising the moral failings of his life and work .
Tom Strong ( 1999 - 2006 )
A love letter to the silver age of comics that nods to Buck Rogers and other classics of pulp fiction .
Tom Strong embodies all of the ideals Moore holds for what a superhero should be .
The League of Extraordinary Gentleman ( 1999 - 2019 )
One of Moore 's best known comic series , The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen is the ultimate in crossover works , drawing on characters from all across the literary world who are on a mission to save it .
Moore also spoke of his disappointment in the quality of comics following the publication of Watchmen – a graphic novel , illustrated by Dave Gibbons , in which a group of costumed vigilantes come out of retirement to investigate the murder of their former colleague .
“ Initially , Watchmen gained a lot of its readership because it was taking an unusual look at superheroes , but actually it was more about redefining comics than it was about redefining one particular genre , ” he said .
“ There has n’t been a more sophisticated comic released in the 25 years since , which I find profoundly depressing , because it was intended to be something that expanded the possibilities of comics rather than what it has apparently become – a massive psychological stumbling block that the rest of the industry has yet to find a way round . ”
We ’ve been following Poster Boy ’s work since day one .
Seeing his work in the subway was a major reason we felt the need to create this blog .
When we heard about his book deal we were very excited — so excited , in fact , that we unknowingly announced the book before the publisher , Mark Batty .
They were kind enough to send us an advance copy to talk about on Subway Art Blog .
The War of Art begins with a quote from Enter the Dragon : “ The enemy only has images and illusions behind which he hides his true motives .
Destroy the image and you break the enemy . ”
Poster Boy wastes no time in acknowledging that the idea of a retrospective book for an artist that has been active for such a short time is absurd .
He is also very forward about pointing out that this book is hypocritical because it contradicts the anti-authorship , anti-copyright , anti-consumerist ideas behind his work .
He addresses all of this in the introduction : “ this book is a part of the supposed medium rather than a retrospective on an artist that has been active for a meager two years . ”
The book is divided into three sections ; the first , called “ Works on Vinyl , ” is a collection of the works that made him famous : advertising alterations in the subway and beyond .
It includes some work that appears on his flickr account but also a fair amount that does not .
The original ads and the altered ads are juxtaposed on facing pages .
This was an essential touch , because it fully illustrates the vast creativity that goes into his on - site mashup work .
A few of our favorites from this section include : a Pepsi ad that is altered to say “ Corn Syrp ” and a Snickers ad altered to say “ Fuck the Post , Read Chompsky . ”
When the alterations are political , they are very strong ; when they are lighthearted , they are very funny .
They are also visually seamless .
They remind you why he became so infamous doing this .
Just when the vinyl section gets warmed up , it seems to end .
The second section of the book is “ Abetments , ” a portion dedicated to collaborations with and tributes to other artists .
Some of the street artists Poster Boy tips his hat to include : Space Invader , Decapitator , Princess Hijab , Katsu , Booker and Keith Haring .
A number of the artist ’s many collaborations with Aakash Nihalani also appear in this section .
The last portion of the book is reserved for Poster Boy ’s exhibition work .
Large scale pieces from shows at Art Basel , the Jajo Gallery and Eastern District are featured in this section .
While it is interesting to see this side of PB ’s work , it seems a bit out of place .
The inclusion of this work makes the book feel closer to the retrospective it says it is not .
This section also includes selections from Poster Boy ’s infamous MoMA advertising hit at Atlantic Avenue – Pacific Street .
This is an important part of the artist ’s work , but also seems out of place in the context of this book .
In general , this book is an effective showcase of the ephemeral work of one of the most interesting , creative artists we have covered on Subway Art Blog .
Its main downfall is not including more of his work .
There is certainly troves more of it on flickr that could have been used .
Alas , this must be another side effect of putting a book out so early in one ’s artistic career .
The War of Art will be available in August on Amazon or a on bookshelf in a commercial space near you .

Cheerleading can be athletic and competitive , but it does n’t count as a sport when universities are counting up male and female athletes to comply with Title IX , a federal gender - equity law .
That was the conclusion in a class action suit on behalf of female athletes at Quinnipiac University in Hamden , Conn .
The school planned to eliminate women ’s volleyball – as well as men ’s golf and outdoor track – to save money .
But it added a competitive cheer squad and counted its 30 female members to show that the percentage of athletes who are female is in proportion to the percentage of students who are female – one way of complying with the law .
US District Judge Stefan Underhill agreed with the volleyball coach , ruling that the school discriminated “ by failing to provide equal athletic participation opportunities for women . ”
Competitive cheerleading “ is still too underdeveloped and disorganized to be treated as offering genuine varsity athletic participation , ” he concluded .
Has Title IX ' outlived its usefulness '?
Title IX advocates count it as another victory for equal opportunity in sports .
Each school ’s efforts to meet Title IX have to be judged individually , but they say this ruling sets an important precedent that will influence universities around the country .
“ We understand that in these difficult economic times , ... schools are looking for ways to tighten their budgets , ... but this case sends a clear message that schools cannot cut costs on the backs of women , ” says Neena Chaudhry , senior counsel for the National Women ’s Law Center in Washington .
Advocates of competitive cheerleading as a sport disagree .
It involves gymnastics and tumbling and has a high injury rate , says Kimberly Archie , founder of the National Cheer Safety Foundation in North Hollywood , Calif .
She also disagrees with the decision more broadly , saying that “ Title IX has outlived its usefulness . ”
Ms. Archie argues that women ’s interest in sports participation on many campuses simply is n’t as high as men’s , so proportional numbers are n’t needed to ensure equal opportunity .
The 95 - page judgment required Quinnipiac to maintain the volleyball team for the coming season and submit a plan within 60 days for how it would comply with Title IX .
Three runners are better than one
It also said female runners on three different teams ( indoor , outdoor , and cross- country track ) could not be counted more than once .
That was one of several ways the school had inflated the number of female athletes or undercounted male athletes , the judge concluded .
“ Institutions are sometimes not doing due diligence in representing the actual numbers on the rosters , ” and this case sends the message that such manipulation wo n’t be tolerated , says Shawn Ladda , president of the National Association of Girls and Women in Sport .
A Quinnipiac spokeswoman expressed disappointment in the ruling .
“ We will continue to press for competitive cheer to become an officially recognized varsity sport in the future , ” said Lynn Bushnell , vice president for public affairs , in a written statement .
“ Consistent with our long - standing plans to expand opportunities in women ’s athletics , the university intends to add women ’s rugby as a varsity sport beginning in the 2011 - 2012 academic year . ”
Neither the National Collegiate Athletic Association ( NCAA ) nor the US Department of Education has recognized competitive cheerleading as a sport .

Mexican human rights defenders are accusing the U.S. Border Patrol of beating , kicking and tasering a Mexican undocumented immigrant to death in San Diego , Calif .
The incident , which has largely gone unreported in U.S. media , occurred after Anastasio Hernandez Rojas was arrested in San Diego County for being in the country without papers .
According to Mexican press reports in the daily La Jornada and other sources , Hernandez was 42 years old and had lived in the United States for 20 years .
He is reported to have had five children , all U.S. citizens .
At the time of his arrest , he was working cleaning swimming pools .
At some point in the process of being removed to Mexico via the San Ysidro - Tijuana border post , Hernandez may have tried to make a break for it , at which point Border Patrol officers beat , kicked and tasered him , apparently leaving him in a coma .
He died on Monday , May 31 , at Sharp Memorial Hospital in Chula Vista , Calif .
The Mexican government has protested the action and human rights groups are promising to help Hernandez ’s family get justice .

PC maker Dell has been accused of selling thousands of desktop PCs despite knowing the machines contained faulty components , according to recently unsealed court documents first reported about on Tuesday by The New York Times .
Court documents unsealed in a civil case against Dell in Federal District Court in North Carolina accuse Dell employees of having prior knowledge that the company 's OptiPlex PCs sold to customers were likely to break , the newspaper reported .
Dell shipped around 11.8 million OptiPlex computers between the May 2003 to July 2005 period that were at risk of failing because of the faulty components , according to the unsealed court and internal documents .
Dell sold OptiPlex desktops to companies and business customers including Wal - Mart and Wells Fargo .
The problems stem from bad capacitors on motherboards .
which could cause systems to fail .
The documents also say that Dell employees knowingly tried to play down component problems , which put customers at risk .
Dell salespeople were told to say " do n't bring this to customer 's attention proactively , " in an effort to conceal system problems , according to the documents reported on by the Times .
Dell has had customer support issues in the past few years .
The company took a US $ 442 million charge during the third quarter of 2006 to account for a number of issues including the costs associated with replacing faulty capacitors on some of its OptiPlex desktops , layoffs and inventory writeoffs .

Israel 's slander campaign against peace activists from the Gaza Freedom Flotilla is n't only about justifying the murder of at least 10 of them , writes Alan Maass .
NO SMEAR is too crude and no lie too outrageous in Israel 's attempt to justify the murderous commando assault on a flotilla of boats carrying humanitarian aid to besieged Gaza .
The flotilla carried hundreds of peace activists from more than 40 countries , many of them renowned for their commitment to nonviolence and the struggle for justice .
But that did n't stop Israel 's Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon from announcing that " [t ] he organizers are well - known for their ties to global jihad , al - Qaeda and Hamas .
They have a history of arms smuggling and deadly terror . "
Ayalon did n't provide any evidence of " a history of arms smuggling " by former State Department official and Code Pink activist Ann Wright .
Or of Viva Palestina organizer Kevin Ovenden 's " ties to al - Qaeda . "
He did n't recount the terrorist exploits of Nobel Peace Prize winner Mairead Corrigan - Maguire , who is on board another vessel headed toward Gaza in an attempt to break Israel 's siege .
But Israeli officials never do .
In a bitter irony , they seem prepared to use the same techniques as Joseph Goebbels , the German Nazis ' propaganda chief , who infamously said : " When one lies , one should lie big , and stick to it . "
Israeli commandos on the deck of a ship in the Gaza Freedom Flotilla
The Israeli strategy in a crisis is to flood the airwaves with distortions , myths , innuendo and outright falsehoods -- and count on sympathizers among Western political leaders and the mainstream press to take up the war cry without asking too many questions .
The approach worked once again with most of the American media .
The assault was a military operation , carried out by heavily armed , elite commandos in the dead of night , boarding civilian vessels in international waters .
Yet virtually every article in the U.S. media used the unspecific weasel words " violence broke out onboard " to avoid making it clear that Israel was the aggressor .
As in the Israeli military 's encounters with Palestinians , casualties from the confrontation were wildly uneven -- at least 10 and as many as 20 peace activists killed , and dozens more injured , compared to fewer than 10 injured among the Israeli commandos , only one of them serious .
But media accounts focused on Israel 's claims about weapons found on board the activists ' ship .
As one person commented as the story unfolded on Monday , " Peculiar how Israel is always violently attacked , but it 's only the ' attackers ' who die . "
The media left unasked some obvious questions , like :
If Israel did have a reason to search a civilian vessel in international waters , why did n't it ask permission to come aboard , and do so during the daytime , so as not to appear as a violent threat ?
Why did it instead order a commando raid in the middle of the night ?
Another question for the media :
If a U.S. vessel in international waters was boarded by a team of Iranian commandos in the middle of the night , would n't you expect the passengers to see the raid as a violent act and to attempt to defend themselves as best they could ?
IF ISRAEL is especially concerned about slandering the peace activists from the Gaza Freedom Flotilla , it is n't only to justify the murder of some of them , but also to distract attention from their mission -- to break the no-less - deadly Israeli siege of Gaza .
Palestinians and those struggling in solidarity for Palestinian rights have for years referred to Israeli - occupied Gaza as an " open- air prison . "
But that phrase has taken on new meaning with the siege imposed by Israel in 2007 .
Gaza City resident and left - wing activist Haidar Eid says that what is happening to the 1.5 million residents of occupied Gaza is a " massacre in slow motion . "
The blockade , carried out with the cooperation and support of the U.S. government , is punishment for the victory of the Islamist Hamas party in 2006 elections for the Palestinian legislative assembly -- and an attempt to further divide Gaza , where Hamas is strongest , from Palestinians in the Israeli - occupied West Bank .
Basically , Israel 's strategy has been to tighten the noose until Palestinians cry " uncle . "
The Israeli government ritually claims that there is no humanitarian crisis in Gaza , but even its supporters in Washington can't go along with this fraud -- the evidence is too overwhelming .
To take the latest example , just days before the assault on the flotilla , Amnesty International released its annual report on human rights , which had this to say about Gaza under the siege :
Mass unemployment , extreme poverty , food insecurity and food price rises caused by shortages left four out of five Gazans dependent on humanitarian aid .
The scope of the blockade and statements made by Israeli officials about its purpose showed that it was being imposed as a form of collective punishment of Gazans , a flagrant violation of international law .
Former President Jimmy Carter was harsher still in a speech at American University in Cairo in 2008 :
Palestinians in Gaza are being actually " starved to death , " receiving fewer calories per day than people in the poorest parts of Africa .
This is an atrocity that is being perpetrated as punishment on the people in Gaza .
It is a crime ... an abomination that this is allowed to go on .
Tragically , the international community at large ignores the cries for help , while the citizens of Gaza are treated more like animals than human beings .
Israel claims that the blockade is limited to so - called " security " items that could be used to carry out violence against Israelis .
But when Sen. John Kerry visited Gaza in 2009 , he and other members " of the highest - ranking American delegation to tour Gaza were shocked to discover that the Israeli blockade against the Hamas - ruled territory included such food staples as lentils , macaroni and tomato paste , " reported the Independent .
As of mid-May , the Palestinian Center for Human Rights reported that Gaza health facilities had run out of 110 types of medication and 123 types of medical supplies as a result of Israel 's blockade -- and within three months would be without 76 more types of medication and 60 types of medical supplies .
When the siege was first imposed , Dov Weisglass , an adviser to then - Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert , commented coldly : " The idea is to put the Palestinians on a diet , but not to make them die of hunger . "
This " diet " has been catastrophic for the people of Gaza , as Jamie Stern - Weiner documented at the New Left Project Web site .
As of November 2009 , 60 percent of people in Gaza were " food insecure , " according to the UN's World Food Program and Food and Agriculture Organization , and another 17 percent were considered vulnerable to food insecurity .
Among those at risk for hunger , two - thirds are children , and they are suffering rising levels of malnutrition and stunted growth .
The level of anemia in infants aged 9 to 12 months was 65.5 percent , according to a World Health Organization assessment .
According to a survey by the UN Relief and Works Agency , " [ T ] he number of Palestine refugees completely unable to secure access to food and lacking the means to purchase even the most basic items , such as soap , school stationary and safe drinking water ... has tripled since the imposition of the blockade in June 2007 . "
Because of the blockade , there has been almost no reconstruction of homes and buildings destroyed in the 2008 - 09 Israeli onslaught against Gaza .
According to the UN Development Program , one year after the assault ended , at least 20,000 Palestinians were still displaced from the nearly 3,500 homes destroyed during Operation Cast Lead .
Only 17.5 percent of schools and educational facilities had been rebuilt .
These are just some of the consequences of Israel 's slow strangulation of Gaza - - yet the Israeli lie machine is working overtime to demonize the international activists who were part of the Gaza Freedom Flotilla for their supposed violence .
The truth is obvious :
The sticks and other improvised weapons that activists used to defend themselves from a commando assault could never do a fraction of the damage that Israel does every day with its siege of Gaza .
THE ASSAULT on the Freedom Flotilla shows how seriously Israel takes the international solidarity effort to defeat the siege of Gaza .
The Israeli establishment was willing to deal with another international outcry against its violence in order to set an example .
As Middle East expert Juan Cole wrote at his Informed Comment blog :
[ T ]he deaths and woundings may have been a brutally frank warning to any future Gaza aid activists that they are taking their lives in their hands if they plan any more flotillas to help the Palestinians .
The Israeli far right may have felt that there was otherwise a danger that in a few months there would be an even bigger flotilla and that eventually the blockade of Gaza would be broken .
If this was , in fact , Israel 's aim , it backfired in one respect .
On Tuesday , the Egyptian government , under pressure from the growing anger at Israel 's assault , announced that it was opening its border with Gaza " for an unlimited amount of time . "
By previously keeping its Rafah border crossing sealed , Egypt had played a crucial role as a junior partner to Israel and the U.S. in maintaining the siege of Gaza .
Nevertheless , Israeli leaders can always hope to regain the upper hand as long as they have the support of the U.S. government .
That 's the crucial factor in all their calculations .
Israel needs the backing of the U.S. government -- not only its political support in deflecting international opposition at the United Nations and elsewhere , but even more critically , the $ 3 billion - plus that Washington provides in aid every year for its Middle East watchdog .
" The Israelis seem to be making decisions as if they can get away with anything , " wrote Atlantic commentator Andrew Sullivan at the end of a long blog post about the Israeli assault .
That the far - from - radical Sullivan would express so much outrage at Israel is a sign of how opinion , even among political moderates in the U.S. , has shifted .
But ultimately , Israel can get away with just about anything -- so long as it can count on the U.S. government to back it up .
That 's why U.S. opponents of the Israeli war on Palestine have a special duty to organize against the lifeline that Washington provides with its political support and financial backing for Israel .
We can start by confronting the Israeli lie machine with the truth -- and make sure the facts get told about the commando raid on the Freedom Flotilla and the murderous siege imposed on the 1.5 million Palestinians of Gaza .
We can continue building the movement for boycotts , divestment and sanctions against Israel -- and organizing to break the blockade of Gaza .
Perhaps the most fitting word to describe our reaction to the new - look Cole in inFamous 2 .
The once gruff - voiced egg - head with electric powers had seemingly been replaced by the cover -star of the next Skate game - a brusque , handsome looking extreme sports star who Sucker Punch describe as being " inspired by Tony Hawk " .
Beyond the controversy of Cole 's face however was a more pressing matter — what 's the sequel actually like ?
New Cole .
Despite getting a completely different face , Cole is still Cole .
At the start of inFamous 2 , Cole still has all the powers he had when you finished the last inFamous .
He can still grind , climb , jump and shoot people with lightning .
But he 's a lesser super - force than he was when we left him .
Empire City has been wiped out by a new threat known as The Beast , and Cole's on the hot - path to the New Orleans - esque New Marais looking for the Ray Sphere - which granted him his powers in the original .
It 's the opposite of a Metroid here - as opposed to an abilitease , this more of an abiligain ; while Cole will start out amazing , he 'll end up even more amazing than ever before .
New power -ups .
One of the big new features Sucker Punch are touting is improved melee .
One such tool that enhances this also happens to be a new power - up — the Amp ; an electrified cattle - prod esque device perfect for smacking around bad guys ' heads .
Melee 's now mapped to the Square and Triangle buttons , controlling light and hard attacks respectively .
These moves can be chained into fluid acts of visceral destruction , giving you an alternative outlet to all the long - range electric zapping .
Additionally , the new Ionic Vortex attack allows you to summon a tornado , which just so happens to be made out of electricity .
This makes light work of most enemies .
Naturally .
Setting .
New Marais is less dotted with sky - scrapers and apartments , and more rich in clock - towers and verandas .
This makes for a more aristically unique setting , and also provides some new gameplay advantages .
Balconies , for example , can be zapped clean off the wall they 're attached to , removing an enemy from the land of the living .
Alternatively , you can just drop them on a normal citizens ' heads because , hey , this is still inFamous afterall .
New enemies .
Sucker Punch are teasing Shadow Of The Colossus - esque bosses the size of a block of flats in inFamous 2 , and while we 've only seen the silhouette of one such being at the end of the latest inFamous trailer , all indications point to some massive set - piece moments in the latest game .
in Famous actually set - up a pretty fantastic universe , with some interesting and frightening art - work , so it 'll be interesting to see just how far Sucker Punch push it in the sequel .
Colour us excited , mind .

Oil worker told the BBC's Panorama programme that both BP and Transocean , who owned the rig , were informed of the leak
An oil worker who survived the BP Deepwater Horizon explosion has claimed that the oil rig's safety equipment was leaking several weeks before it exploded , triggering the huge spill in the Gulf of Mexico .
Tyrone Benton says that he spotted a leak on the rig 's Blowout Preventer ( BOP ) , the device that is meant to shut the well down if there is an accident .
He told the BBC's Panorama programme that both BP and Transocean , who owned the rig , were informed of the leak , and the faulty part – a control pod – was switched off rather than being repaired .
" We saw a leak on the pod [ and ] we informed the company , " Benton told the programme , which will be broadcast at 8.30 pm tonight .
" They have a control room where they could turn off that pod and turn on the other one , so that they do n't have to stop production . "
Benton added that he was unsure whether the leaking control pod had been turned back on again before a huge gas explosion ripped through the rig on 20 April , killing 11 workers .
The failure of the BOP was one key factor that led to the ongoing environmental disaster .
The BOP is designed to clamp the well tightly shut , using cutting equipment to slice through the casing , but on 20 April it did not engage .
After the explosion , BP sent robot submarines down to the seabed to try to trigger the BOP , but failed .
The company has already admitted to a Congressional committee that the robots discovered a leak in the BOP 's hydraulic systems , which meant they could not generate enough force for its giant shears to cut through the pipe .
Last week , BP chief executive Tony Hayward repeatedly cited the BOP as a major cause of the disaster , saying it was " not as failsafe " as BP had been told .
Benton 's revelations will pile even more pressure on BP , at a time when its minority party in the leaking well is refusing to pay its share of the costs .
Anadarko Petroleum Corporation argues that BP was " grossly negligent " or guilty of " willful misconduct " in the way it drilled the Macondo prospect , which some workers described as a " nightmare well " .
Last week the Congressional committee accused BP of taking " risky " decisions to save time and money .
And in another development , BP has been accused of lying after internal documents showed that it has estimated that the leak could reach 100,000 barrels a day , much higher than its public forecasts .
$ 2bn and rising
The cost of the clean - up operation has now broken through the $ 2bn ( £ 1.3 bn ) mark , BP told the City this morning .
That is just a fraction of the total bill , though , with BP already committed to putting $ 20 bn into an escrow account to cover compensation claims .
That will not cap its liabilities , though , and there are suggestions that BP is now looking to raise $ 50bn .
The company has said it will sell off some of its assets .
This has raised concerns in several countries , including Russia , where the TNK - BP joint venture generates around a quarter of BP 's global production .
Hayward is to fly to Russia to assure the Kremlin that BP can survive the oil spill disaster , the Financial Times reported today .
BP 's chief executive took the decision to meet Russian president Dmitry Medvedev in the next few weeks following a weekend board meeting , and after Medvedev warned that the catastrophe could lead to BP's " annihilation " .
BP continues to insist that it will clean up the spill and pay " all legitimate claims " , and rejected Anadarko 's claims .
" These allegations will neither distract the company 's focus on stopping the leak nor alter our commitment to restore the Gulf coast , " said Hayward .
" Other parties besides BP may be responsible for costs and liabilities arising from the oil spill , and we expect those parties to live up to their obligations . "
Shares in BP fell by more than 3 % this morning to 345 p , making it the biggest faller on the FTSE 100 .
Swiss bank UBS warned shareholders that it did not expect the company to resume paying dividends until 2012 .
Last week it agreed to cancel payments for the rest of this year , but UBS believes that the cost of the Deepwater spill means a longer suspension is inevitable .
City sources believe that BP may have to sell its operations in the North Sea as part of its drive to cut spending and raise funds .
Hockey , like baseball , allows players to take justice in their own hands .
On ice , it 's the job of the enforcer to stick up for his teammate who received a dirty hit .
On the baseball field , a pitcher can beam a batter who maybe took out the second baseman 's legs on a slide in the previous inning .
Both actions are central to the game — not merely incidental — because they represent attempts of one player to resolve or punish what 's been done by another .
Fighting is the continuation of play , just as war is the continuation of politics by other means .
The idea that men should be subject to justice is strong .
It 's why we 're drawn to stories about mafioso , cowboys , and thugs : in their imagined worlds , people are punished with speed , ruthlessness , and without court appeals .
It 's seductive to believe matters could be made right if someone was certain who the bad guy is and powerful enough to make him pay .
In reality , certainty and power do n't exist — or at least should n't exist because of how they would corrupt the judgment of those who should impartially bring criminals to justice .
That 's why there is due process , the burden of proof on the prosecutor , and the presumption of innocence for the accused .
No wonder sports elicit such passion : fans have near omniscience over players because sports are meant to be seen in full .
We feel certain we know who 's done wrong ( if we 're not , we 'll know after the third replay in slow motion ) but we 're powerless to make it right .
Maybe that 's one reason we cheer men with whom we have little in common and who may be otherwise loathsome .
We do n't feel powerless when they do what we wish .
That 's how fans can root for a gruesome hockey fight .
And that 's part of the reason why they 'll miss Bob Probert .
We want to hear what you think about this article .

Jesus buys his siding in Oklahoma City
Have you ever wondered where Jesus buys the things he needs ?
Not sure about his groceries but he gets the siding for his heavenly mansion at “ Terrell ’s Siding ” in Oklahoma City .
After Mr. Terrell spouts about secular socialism in the short video , his site offers Government tax credits .
Taken from his website HERE .
Attention Cost - Conscious Americans !
As you probably already know , the new Stimulus Bill – known as The American Recovery & Reinvestment Act of 2009 – was signed into law on February 17 , 2009 .
The bill extends and modifies the tax credits for qualifying products as established in the Energy Tax Policy Act of 2005 .
Best of all , you can earn tax credits up to $ 1500 !
Terrell Siding and Windows can provide a wide array of energy - saving products to help reduce your utility bills , year - round .
We encourage you to give us a call to talk about the value we offer by way of our energy - efficient products .
A few weeks ago , I was alerted by a Google alert to a post , “ Conversation With An Atheist “ , on the site Everyday Christian .
Since I ’m always interested to find Christians who want to converse with atheists , to see what they have to say about us and to us , I checked it out .
It turned out to be a fairly run -of - the - mill creationist argument by a Christian apologist named Jack Wellman .
Since my interest was piqued , I posted a comment in reply to Mr. Wellman , and then another when he responded ( you can see them by following the link to the thread ) .
Several others chimed in as well .
Wellman kept responding , using the typical creationist tactic of changing the topic to a new argument every time the previous one was refuted .
He also posted several remarks that showed a spectacular misunderstanding of evolution , such as inexplicably claiming that the universality of the genetic code was evidence against common descent , rather than one of the strongest pieces of evidence for it .
I tried to correct these fallacies in as civil a manner as possible .
However , at some point , it seems that either Wellman or the site moderators decided he was n’t faring well enough in the debate , and simply stopped allowing new comments to be posted .
I subscribed to the thread by e-mail and got one final message several days ago , from another contributor complaining that his previous comments had been censored .
But when I checked the thread , this comment had been deleted .
Since then , no new comments have been allowed to appear .
This was my last comment , which was submitted over a week ago and has n’t been posted .
There ’s been no explanation from the site moderators as to why it was rejected :
“ And so you , evolutionists , and biologists had expected to see something that would link a primitive ancestor to the middle Cambrian animal Pikaia .
Explain the archeological evidence that Pikaia had a less - complex ancestor then . ”
Easily done : Haikouella is n’t an ancestor of Pikaia .
You ’ve jumped to the erroneous conclusion that a species living at time X must necessarily have been the ancestor of a species at time X+Y .
If you really want to understand this , Jack , I ’m happy to explain it .
Evolution rarely , if ever , works in a single , smooth trajectory of change – species A changes into species B , which changes into species C , and so on .
Instead , what we usually see is a path of descent like a branching bush : species A radiates into species B1 , B2 , B3 … and so on .
Most of these go extinct , but B2 , say , speciates into C1 , C2 , and C3 , and again , some of the daughter species go extinct and others diverge in their own ways .
But species do n’t have fixed lifespans , and there ’s nothing to dictate how long a particular species will survive before it goes extinct .
There may still be living species from the A or B generation existing side - by - side with far more advanced descendants .
It ’s like having an uncle who ’s younger than you : for humans , it ’s unusual but certainly possible .
But in evolution , it ’s downright common .
For obvious reasons , it ’s difficult to reconstruct an exact line of descent from fossils , just as you probably could n’t put together an exact family tree just by looking at photographs .
It ’s possible that either Pikaia or Haikouella is the common ancestor of all vertebrates , or it may be another species we have n’t discovered yet .
But what ’s certain is that evolution was doing a lot of experimenting with chordates in the Cambrian , and what ’s equally certain is that we came from one of those lineages , because true vertebrates – primitive fish called ostracoderms – start appearing in the Late Cambrian and then in greater variety in the next period , the Ordovician .
This was why I wrote “ Pikaia or one very like it ” – all this detail is what lies behind that little phrase .
“ Irises and humans have 25 % of the same DNA , so based upon your faulty logic , we should be at least 1/4th part Iris . ”
It would be more accurate to say that irises and humans are very similar when it comes to the most basic functions of life , which is true , and is a prediction of evolution via universal common descent .
Really , why are you so surprised by this ?
Sure , irises and humans do n’t look much alike , but at the lowest levels of organization , we have a lot in common .
We ’re both made out of eukaryotic cells .
We both store genetic information in DNA , copy it into messenger RNA , and transcribe that RNA into proteins .
We both use ATP as the cellular currency of energy .
We both share basic components of cellular metabolism like glycolysis and the Krebs cycle .
We have these and many other traits in common because we ( that is to say , animals and plants ) are both descended from an ancestral eukaryote that did all these things .
We ’ve both inherited a common toolbox of genes for performing the basic functions of life – genes that perform functions so basic , it would be essentially impossible for evolution to change them in any major way – and as the human and iris lines diverged , we each added our own specializations on top of that .
“ Incidentally , you failed to mention the fact that the genetic code for protein - coding genes is nearly universal in eukaryotes and prokaryotes .
Millions of alternative genetic codes exist , so why do all organisms have nearly the same one ? ”
Again : because we ’re all descended from a common ancestor .
This is actually one of the most powerful lines of evidence for evolution .
Why do you think it should be a problem for us ?
Note that an omnipotent creator could easily have created every single species with a completely different genetic code , a completely different way of turning genes into protein .
That ’s the kind of evidence that would prove evolution impossible .
Instead , what we find is near universality , with just a few very minor variations – the only signature we could reasonably expect from a process of descent with modification .
If you see anything so inflammatory in this comment that a site moderator would have cause to reject it , please tell me what it is , because I ’m stumped .
The only conclusion I can draw is that Jack Wellman realized he was n’t doing well and did n’t want to deal with any further criticism , and prevailed on the site admins to stop letting it through .
( I ’ve also saved a copy of the thread in case they go back and delete earlier comments , which would n’t surprise me at this point . )
Sadly , in my experience , this is n’t uncommon .
I ’m increasingly coming to the conclusion that it ’s pointless to debate creationists and other religious fundamentalists in any forum that they control , because they ’ll shut down the discussion as soon as they sense they ’re losing , even if the contrary comments are polite and on topic .
They simply ca n’t be trusted to allow a fair and open debate ; they have too much to lose .
And this is n’t true just on web forums , but in wider society , where religious believers constantly try to shut down criticism with blasphemy laws , “ hate speech ” claims , threats , and every other method fair or foul available to them .
After some searching , I found Mr. Wellman ’s own site .
I ’ve sent him an e-mail to let him know about this post and to invite him to continue the debate here , or even just to explain why my comments stopped being posted .
I do n’t expect much to come of it , but we ’ll have to see .

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is standing in the way of an intelligence authorization bill as she tries to press President Obama for greater congressional oversight of the CIA 's covert activities – a move that is angering fellow Democratic leaders , the Hill newspaper reported Friday .
Pelosi's intel obstruction comes one year after she accused the CIA of lying to Congress about the use of enhanced interrogation practices , including waterboarding , on terror suspects -- an allegation that the CIA has strongly disputed .
Now she wants to enable Congress to use the Government Accountability Office ( GAO ) to probe the CIA and is demanding that the CIA and other intelligence agencies provide more information about their covert activities with the entire Senate and House intelligence committees instead of just the leaders , according to the newspaper .
Pelosi made her demands known to National Security Adviser Jim Jones in a meeting Wednesday , the newspaper said .
With the intel bill blocked , the nomination of Lt. Gen.
James Clapper to replace the ousted Dennis Blair as director of national intelligence is in limbo .
Sen . Dianne Feinstein , D - Calif , chairwoman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence , is n't pleased with Pelosi 's maneuvering .
" It 's been five years since anyone has been able to get a bill through , " she told the newspaper .
" If you want strong congressional oversight you have to begin to pass these bills . "
Pelosi blocked the bill after Feinstein and the administration lent their support to a deal that did n't include GAO oversight but expanded congressional notification requirements .
" We 're in agreement , the two committees , we 've taken GAO out and we 've negotiated the notification requirements to three , which are acceptable to the administration , " Feinstein told the newspaper .
" So we have a bill that can pass and be signed by the president . "
Pelosi's feud with the CIA last year appeared to end in a stalemate .
Her account of the allegations changed several times as she sought to clarify what she did or did n't know about the interrogation methods that she was pushing to investigate .
She initially said that she was never told that the controversial interrogation methods were being used .
But a national intelligence report later showed that she was briefed eight years ago on the tactics while she was on the House Intelligence Committee .
Her spokesman then said the speaker thought the techniques were legal and that waterboarding was not used .
Since then , Pelosi has largely remained silent on the matter , except to say that she has confidence in the agency to do its job .
Google 's gift to attendees of its I / O conference last week was the hot new HTC EVO 4G cellphone .
One of the lucky giftees was developer Matthew Mastracci , who showed his gratitude by teaming up with two friends and hacking the hell out of the poor little EVO .
A few hours later and the team had successfully rooted the phone , and " managed to get the standard su tool installed . "
This means that they had root , or super - user access to the phone and its file system .
This lets you do anything you like to it .
Here 's the video :
What does this mean for security ?
Not much .
If you have physical access and a little time , you can hack pretty much any device .
More interesting is the reminder that the new wave of smartphones - Android and iPhone - both use variants of the UNIX operating system under the hood , first developed way back in 1969 .
That these modern pocket miracles are running on an OS invented before I was born still kind of blows my mind .

It 's not everyday you get a message from the star of one your favourite shows , but that 's what happened to me the other day when I got this message from @edwardjolmos , AKA Admiral Adama .
I 'd just tweeted one of my fellow GeekDads about watching the third series of Battlestar Galactica , and this reply came back almost instantly .
Now I 'm not naive enough to believe that Gaff himself is sitting there , tapping out replies to anyone who mentions BSG or Miami Vice , but a quick scan through his stream at the time showed that it 's probably not a [ cylon ] bot at the controls , as it actually mentioned ' BSG ' in the reply on this one , but not the others .
Some of the later ones , however , do seem a bit suspect , but that 's not the point , I 'm not vouching for the authenticity of the account .
The point is the link included in the tweet which leads to this YouTube clip of a documentary Olmos is making with his production company ( Olmos Productions , what else ? ) .
Olmos and his colleague went to the Gulf of Mexico to lend their support by documenting what they saw and interviewing locals about the real effects of the BP oil spill in the gulf on the local residents and small businesses in the affected area .
The tweet asked me to pass this along to my followers , and who am I to argue with The Old Man ?
Please tell your friends and do what you can to help out .
From the YouTube blurb :
Robert Young and I jumped on a plane and went to the Gulf of Mexico just to lend our support ...
... It was brutal !
I was not ready for the human aspect because no one had prepared me for it .
I thought they would be angry .
They are devastated .
If you feel like doing something , just go down there ( anywhere on the Gulf ) and support by spending time and energy in the region .
They need our support .
Thank you for Caring .

Most people in the world think that asking questions is the easiest way to open your man up , and get him to start talking .
But in reality , it ’s these very questions that men hate answering the most , says Vinod Srinivas .
Now where do I begin ?!!
This is one of the most important and crucial parts of a relationship .
Maybe not to women , but to men , definitely !
A while ago , I had attended a meeting of several counselors and relationship experts , and as the conversation rolled on , one of the women counselors told me about a chart of questions that she had prepared for women .
She beamed as she told me that the chart was called “ The fun questions to ask your man ”  .
As I heard what she told me , I was horrified .
I thought she was mad !
She briefly told me about each question and told me how this little piece of information can help change a relationship and help the women understand their men better .
But I thought otherwise , to me these questions sounded like a nail in the coffin .
Maybe that ’s why men and women find it so hard to communicate with each other all the time .
In every conversation between a man and a woman who are romantically involved , at one point or the other , comes that question that every man dreads .
I fondly call it “ The Nail ! ”  because these questions are pretty much the type that nails the man or pins him against the answer until he blurts out something .
And the consequence of answering these questions is not going to be good all the time .
The Nail Questions
Now let me give you a small brief of those cute questions that this counselor told me about .
These Nail questions are short , poison tipped , scheming and meant to hit the man hard and square in the chest .
The small Nails include :
What do you like about me ?
If I met with an accident and was disfigured , would you still go out with me ?
Would you give me your whole salary every month after we get married ?
Those medium Nails include :
What would you do if I cheated on you ?
Would you like to be reborn to see each other again ?
If God asked you for three boons , what would they be and why ?
Those painfully long Nails :
Would you go out with someone else if I died ?
If your ex girlfriend wants you back , then would you leave me for her ?
Would you leave a surprise party hosted for you by your friends midway if you had to have a candlelight dinner with me that same night ?
What is that extreme thing that you can do for me to make me believe that you love me the most in this world ?
How much do you love me ?
Etc. , etc. , etc .

Why your Man Hates Answering Questions
Israel 's ambassador in Madrid provoked outrage this morning by suggesting Spaniards should worry more about the number of people dying on the roads every weekend and less about the nine people killed in his country 's raid on the Gaza flotilla .
" Yes , nine people have died .
But 155 died in a terrorist attack in India last week .
Who cares about that ?
Have you heard anything about it ?
Twenty - three Spaniards died on the roads this weekend , " Raphael Schutz told El Periódico newspaper .
An embassy spokesman , Lior Haiat , said comments had been taken out of context and the ambassador had been referring to Spanish media coverage .
" Of course we care about any deaths , " said Haiat , who claimed the flotilla carried 100 Turkish mercenaries .
" Even when they are mercenaries and terrorists . "
In an interview published in Spanish , Schutz compared the Gaza flotilla activists to the radical Islamist train bombers who killed 191 people on Madrid commuter trains in 2004 .
" We are talking about people on board [ the flotilla ] who are connected to al - Qaida , " he said when El Periódico 's interviewer pointed out that the Madrid attacks had been carried out by al - Qaida - inspired terrorists .
" Fifty of the people who left Turkey are known for their connections with Hamas , with al - Qaida .
Are these people pacifists ? " .
They hide behind a few Europeans . "
Posted by John , July 8th , 2010 - under People smugglers , Refugees .
‘ That people smuggling is an evil trade to be punished . ’
One of Prime Minister Julia Gillard ’s nationally ‘ agreed ’ points on immigration when speaking at the Lowy Institute on 6 July 2010 .
Actually people smuggling has a long and honourable history .
During the Nazi barbarity ordinary people – people smugglers – saved tens and perhaps hundreds of thousands of Jews .
Most did it because they hated what the Nazis were doing ; they were decent compassionate human beings .
Shamefully those who ‘ turned back the boats ’ or wanted to ‘ stop the flood ’ of Jews were the Governments of ‘ civilised ’ countries like the United States , Great Britain and Australia .
Oskar Schindler was paid for his people smuggling .
Did that make him an evil trader ?
No .
He saved people ’s lives .
It made him a hero .
Kevin Rudd ’s hero Dietrich Bonhoeffer was a people smuggler .
He was arrested for secreting Jews to safety .
Did that make him an evil trader or evil scum as Rudd put it ?
No .
Moses too was people smuggler .
Did that make him an evil trader ?
No .
Some border guards helped the Holy Family flee to Egypt .
Perhaps they were evil ?
If they had turned Jesus and his parents back we might have had a very different religious society .
What about Rick in Casablanca ?
The Scarlet Pimpernel ?
Sydney Carton from A Tale of Two Cities ?
If some in the Catholic Church are to be believed , Pius XII was a people smuggler .
What about all those who helped the Vietnamese boat people flee the regime ?
Were they evil ?
What about those who helped tens of thousands flee Stalinist Europe .
Evil too ?
People smugglers helped blacks escape the South in the 1800s in America .
They helped draft dodgers flee the US for Canada in the 60s and 70s .
They got ANC members and others out of apartheid South Africa .
They helped people leave Zimbabwe .
Evil ?
I think not .
Are those who help people flee the terror we have launched against the people of Afghanistan and Iraq evil ?
Are those who help Tamils flee the genocide in Sri Lanka evil ?
Are those who help Palestinians find new lives far away from Israel ’s apartheid evil ?
OK , so let ’s come to the here and now .
Poor Indonesian fisherman risk their boats and lives to bring refugees to Australia .
They do n’t make much money .
The people they are bringing are fleeing because they have a well founded fear of persecution – death , rape , imprisonment .
These fishermen are heroes .
Gillard ’s attack on people smugglers is a crude dog whistle .
Her real target is asylum seekers .
Labor ’s inhumanity knows no bounds .
The time has come to fight back – not with namby pamby ‘ vote for me ’ non-solutions but by building a mass fighting organisation of militants that defends all those under attack – refugees , aborigines , workers , gays and lesbians .
This will be a socialist organisation that understands that a new world free of oppression is possible – a world where those who produce the wealth own it , where democracy is a daily lived event , where people , like capital , can travel the world to improve their lives .
Then we will have no need of borders .
No one will be illegal .
Until then we must organise against Labor and for refugees .

One day next month every student at Loyola Law School Los Angeles will awake to a higher grade point average .
But it ’s not because they are all working harder .
The school is retroactively inflating its grades , tacking on 0.333 to every grade recorded in the last few years .
The goal is to make its students look more attractive in a competitive job market .
In the last two years , at least 10 law schools have deliberately changed their grading systems to make them more lenient .
These include law schools like New York University and Georgetown , as well as Golden Gate University and Tulane University , which just announced the change this month .
Some recruiters at law firms keep track of these changes and consider them when interviewing , and some do not .
Law schools seem to view higher grades as one way to rescue their students from the tough economic climate  and perhaps more to the point , to protect their own reputations and rankings .
Once able to practically guarantee gainful employment to thousands of students every year , the schools are now fielding complaints from more and more unemployed graduates , frequently drowning in student debt .
I would recommend a different USB part :

It is panel mount , so it will look nicer and is self - trimming .
It has two USB ports and has leads so you do n't need to disassemble or hack the part .
It just works .
Most importantly , it is rated at 2.1A ( max you want to go on a 10A 12 v circuit is about 3A ) , so you can charge iPads or charge iPhones 2 x faster .

You ’ll never find as good a metaphor for the modern time as social news aggregators ( SNAs ) like Digg , Reddit and Fark .
On these , news items are posted , and users vote on them — with the pretend - I ’m - a - Roman - Emperor thumb up or down — and the most popular ones rise to the top of the homepage .
When first founded , these services at first attract people who want actual news and informative reading .
They know that big media news panders to the dummy audience that wants bread and circuses .
Instead , they want to be ahead of the curve .
If you ’re starting a business , or just trying to stay interested in life , finding good news is important and a social news aggregator can do it for you — if the audience is game .
But over time , as word spreads , entropy strikes .
What happens is familiar to anyone who knows our modern cycle of trend - product - decline - conform :
A new idea rises and people like it ;
Since people liking it means it can be elected or sold , it soon is to great profit ;
In doing so , the people owning it dumb it down or otherwise kill its essence ; Consequently , the audience leaves .
What happened at Reddit was the flip side of this : while the process was the same , it was n’t done for dollars — in fact , it ’s amazing Reddit is solvent .
Instead , it was done for popularity , because there ’s no use to having an SNA if your links are n’t popular .
Popular links means high Google rank , which means that indirectly , you influence the market by determining what comes up when Joe Consumer goes to a browser and types in keywords .
At some point , the Crowd found Reddit — and by the Crowd , I mean that large group of people who have no point in life but to please themselves .
Smart people have a purpose , whether selfless or otherwise , but it generally involves achievement : inventing technologies , making music , painting art , climbing mountains , running non-profits , you name it .
The Crowd has nothing but their day jobs , a pattern of acting for their own pleasure only , and to compensate for how low that makes them feel , an axe to grind against society .
They ’re drones who like to find some reason to “ be important , ” which since they do nothing , is unrelated to what they produce .
Instead , it ’s related to the opinions they have , the memes they know , how clever they are and so on .
Douglas Haddow says it best in Adbusters :
An artificial appropriation of different styles from different eras , the hipster represents the end of Western civilization â€ “ a culture lost in the superficiality of its past and unable to create any new meaning .
Not only is it unsustainable , it is suicidal .
While previous youth movements have challenged the dysfunction and decadence of their elders , today we have the “ hipster ” â€ “ a youth subculture that mirrors the doomed shallowness of mainstream society .
– Adbusters
In pursuit of popularity , Reddit went from being a community of leaders and smart people to a playground for the Crowd .
The Crowd do n’t want cutting - edge news ; they want ideas that make them comfortable being themselves .
A partial list :
Memes you can feel witty for repeating
Angry articles about how it ’s not your fault you ’re failing at society
Any rhetoric that tears down those who have risen above
Clever and trite documentaries about lifestyles of the failed
Emotional , tear - jerking or despondent articles
Calls to group revenge , such as against animal abusers
More specifically , the Crowd likes anything that is both inclusive and selective , meaning that you need to know the password to enter .
Want to be cool in indie rock circles ?
Talk about Deerhoof .
Want to be accepted on the far left ?
Talk about Alinsky .
Want to have the guys like you at the local sports bar ?
Talk about how Roethlisberger is innocent .
In other words , the Crowd is like other in - groups in that it is a social group with implications beyond socialization between individuals .
For example , people base their political , economic and personal lifestyle decisions on social influences , and these in turn have influences in the society at large .
Kuran begins with a simple , even mundane point : social pressures can make people say that they want and believe something that they really do n’t want or believe .
In a Communist regime , for example , almost everyone may talk about the enormous wisdom and virtue of the leaders of the Party , even though almost everyone thinks that the leaders are scoundrels and fools .
In a small town in America , nearly everyone may attend and pray in church , even if many people are unsure whether they believe in God .
The result of social pressures is to produce what Kuran calls “ preference falsification , ” a phenomenon that occurs when you make an inaccurate public statement about your actual preferences ( or beliefs ) .
Falsified preferences might be described more simply , of course , as lies ; but they are a distinctive , and distinctly interesting , kind of lies , with particular social implications .
– TNR
I do n’t think this process is unique to Reddit .
I think it ’s human entropy , which is a subset of entropy , which is that over time organization is lost .
Things decay and break down .
In the case of human systems , we forget what our symbols mean , and start acting to gain symbolic power instead of achieve things in reality .
To demonstrate this , one Redditor did a did a little experiment .
He or she compared the replies to the exact same article with a four - year gap between submissions .
The 2006 version of the thread could be compared side - by - side with the 2010 version .
The result ?
The 2006 thread had insightful mathematics , historical comparisons and analysis ; the 2010 version , a competition to repeat as many clever memes and familiar jokes as possible .
On Reddit , when people stopped caring about being an informative news source , the 4 chan - style memes , lolcats , stupid preaching to the choir articles , and other chaff floated in , destroying what made Reddit a great resource .
Now what ’s left is a Crowd of people who want to see things that confirm what they already believe .
I call it the Reddit Hivemind Groupthink ( RHG ) because it has attributes of all of these buzzwords .
It ’s an in - group based not on who you know , but what opinions and likes / dislikes you have , geared toward the manchild or other dependent of the entertainment economy .
It ’s sad because it eliminates a news source , but inevitable because once anything gets popular , it becomes a trend and then people get onboard who have no idea what made it originally valuable .
They then make it into what is convenient for them , which since they lack direction and live in denial , is whatever does n’t offend their lifestyles .
While today ’s Redditors want you to think they ’re enlightened savants bringing us the truth against the wishes of an oppressive right - wing government , the truth is that they have declined much like “ Anonymous ” did at 4 chan .
They lost their impetus because they became inward looking .
On the internet , they ’re superstars .
In reality they ’re boring people with boring jobs , selfish hobbies , inflated self image and an unquenchable anger toward anyone who has more than they do .
This is n’t the first time I ’ve seen a community sink this way .
In fact , it ’s how all communities sink , barring getting outright confiscated by the FBI ( as happened to several of the communities I frequented in the 1980s ) .
They get crushed under their own weight , lose sight of what made them valuable , and become like every other played - out trend , more detritus of a society moving too fast for its own good .

HAVANA ( Reuters ) - Cuban revolutionary leader Fidel Castro took his warning of impending nuclear war to Cuba ’s Foreign Ministry on Friday , where he explained the reasons for his dire prediction in his fifth public appearance in 10 days .
Former Cuban leader Fidel Castro ( 2nd L ) stands with trainers of Havana 's National Aquarium during a visit July 15 , 2010 .
Castro has been seen only in occasional photographs and videos since he underwent emergency intestinal surgery in July 2006 and ceded power provisionally to his younger brother , Raul Castro .
He resigned in February 2008 and Raul Castro was officially elected president by the National Assembly .
REUTERS / Revolution Studios
Castro ’s sudden re-emergence after four years in seclusion for health reasons has raised questions about his intentions , but his message has been consistent -- a devastating war is at hand if the United States , in alliance with Israel , tries to enforce international sanctions against Iran for its nuclear activities .
He also has predicted the United States will attack North Korea .
“ The United States finds itself now in an unsolvable dilemma ( in the Middle East ) .
It can not get out , nor can it stay , ” Castro told 115 ambassadors , who listened with rapt attention .
“ It wo n’t get out of that situation through diplomacy , but through the power of its arms , ” he said , pointing his finger in the air and pontificating at length as in the old days .
Castro , 83 , spoke for more than an hour as he sat in front of the ambassadors .
He looked fit , relaxed and fully in charge as he took questions and read numerous news reports to back up his position .
He said he had partially recovered from the “ sudden and grave situation of health ” that forced him from power .
Castro disappeared from public view following emergency intestinal surgery in July 2006 and ceded power to his younger brother , now President Raul Castro .
He resurfaced on July 7 at a scientific research center in Havana and has since made several appearances in person and in a videotaped television interview .
Theories abound about why the man who ruled Cuba for 49 years after taking power in a 1959 revolution has returned to public view .
He has said his only interest is in warning the world of the coming conflict .
His reappearance has coincided with Cuba ’s biggest release of political prisoners since 1998 , in a deal cut with the Catholic Church , and intentional or not , has drawn away from it .
The church announced on July 7 that 52 political prisoners , or about a third of the island ’s jailed dissidents , would be freed over the next few months .
The releases began on Monday .
Wide - ranging speculation includes theories that Castro is sending a message of stability at a time of uncertainty about Cuba ’s future , that he felt his warning of war was being ignored , or that he simply wanted to return to the limelight .
The Cuban government has said nothing except for the reports of his visits in state - run media , which on Friday said Foreign Ministry employees and people from the surrounding neighborhood sent him off with a “ prolonged ovation and emotional ( shouts of ) ‘ Viva . ’ ”
OSCON Linux kernel maintainers have offered Google three ways of returning Android into their good graces .
Google 's options for re-admission to the kernel are : put the stubs of Android 's wait locks into the main kernel , introduce Android 's wait locks as PMQOS constraints , or adopt a patch written by a Linux kernel maintainer that would re-implement wait locks in a " socially acceptable way " .
Android was booted from the Linux kernel when its drivers were deleted last year .
It was claimed that nobody cared about the Android kernel code and that Google had made kernel integration difficult with a " sometimes bizarre " security model .
Linux kernel SCSI subsystem maintainer James Bottomley told The Reg that it 's up to Google to decide which of the three ways back it prefers .
" We need their feedback on the three options , " Bottomley told us at the O'Reilly Open - Source Convention in Portland , Oregon .
Google said it has offered Android code for inclusion in the next version of the Linux kernel – version 2.6.34 – but these failed to materialize in the first release candidate .
Google open source programs manager Chris DiBona told The Reg that Google is now " hanging " and the fact its changes did n't make RC1 makes him doubt they 'll be included in the final version of 2.6.34 at all .
DiBona said at OSCON : " We are still talking to them [ kernel maintainers ] – we 'll see what happens .
We want to be in there .
It will open up a lot of devices to the kernel . "
He 's right to be doubtful .
It seems Google 's fix was shot down by kernel maintainers in the PMQOS sub system .
They objected to hacking the kernel to facilitate changes designed for mobile devices .
The fix appears to have been the result of talks between Google and kernel maintainers at this year 's Linux Collaboration Summit in San Francisco , California .
Google had proposed a set of suspend locks – actions that intervened in the race around the phone 's system during shut down process in response to an incoming call .
The suspend locks were designed to stop shut down so that the user does n't miss their call .
" Although the sleep and suspend is very elegant , it introduced wait locks to get around the race problem and the kernel developers were not happy with the fact it 's a hack around for a lot of races that got introduced into the infrastructure , " Bottomley said .
Now , there are the three options on the table awaiting Google 's approval .
Stubs would be a temporary measure that could do more harm than good .
Developers could compile code to either the main kernel or the Android kernel , creating confusion .
Stubs are used in programming to simulate functionality and are used when targeting different platforms .
In a further twist , stubs would be removed from Linux after a period of nine months if there 's no permanent fix adding to the confusion .
" Stubs is a bit more dangerous because if nothing happens after a certain time the period stubs approach will get thrown out , " Bottomley said .
Bottomley favored the PMQOS or full patch options .
Modifications have already been written for the PMQOS subsystem that tackles locks so code 's ready to go .
The patch , meanwhile , would also perform locks but using what Bottomley called a more " socially acceptable way " – presumably keeping maintainers happy .
Android would need to accept these changes , though .
" I 'd like to see it sorted out fully ... but we need Google to comment fully [ on the proposals ] , " Bottomley said . ®
Steven Spielberg ’s new film ‘ War Horse ’ , which is scheduled for release August 10 , 2011 , will be distributed by Dreamworks Pictures .
The cast has also been announed for the drama that takes place during World War I .
According to Empire magazine , young actor Jeremy Irvine has landed the lead role of Albert and is joined by Emily Watson , Peter Mullan , David Thewlis , Niels Arestrup , Nicolas Bro , David Kross , Leonard Carow , Rainer Bock , Robert Emmsand and Benedict Cumberbatch .
Not too many recognizable names here , but it is Spielberg and it ’s a movie set during a war…so I ’m in .
Set in 1914 , the film centers on Joey , a beautiful bay - red foal with a distinctive cross on his nose that is sold to the army and thrust into the midst of the war on the Western Front .
With his officer , he charges toward the enemy , witnessing the horror of the battles in France .
But even in the desolation of the trenches , Joey ’s courage touches the soldiers around him and he is able to find warmth and hope .
But his heart aches for Albert , the farmer ’s son he left behind .
More casting yet to come , as the film will start filming this August .
Imagine Entertainment ( Ron Howard and Brian Grazer ) and Radical Pictures are bringing the graphic novel , ‘ Legends : The Enchanted ’ , to the big screen .
Written and created by Nick Percival , the story is as follows – “ Violently ripped from the pages of folklore come the Enchanted .
Supernatural immortals living in a dark , steampunk , creature - infested world where nature , technology and foul magic are in constant conflict .
When the twisted , burnt remains of the half - wooden , half - mechanical warrior , Pinocchio , are discovered , wolf hunter Red Hood and giant killer Jack realize the fragile rules of their existence have been shattered .
With the help of other powerful Enchanted ( the mercenary , Goldilocks and psychic exterminators , Hansel and Gretel ) , Jack and Red team up on an adventure to stop whatever , or whoever is destroying their powers and murdering their kind . ”
No studio , director , or pretty much anything else has been announced yet , but just the idea that this is going to be a motion picture is enough for now .
It was inevitable for a film that cost $ 40 million to make and grossed $ 55 during it ’s opening weekend .
Sony executives were already meeting with writers to have them pitch ideas of where they could take a sequel to the popular film .
The originals sequel was a monster hit when it came out back in the ’ 80’s , and this one will probably be the same .
I think they should do a reversal of the original sequel , and bring it back to America .
They ’ve already been to Japan , so bring the Karate Kid home and create an interesting story set here .
With the ‘ A - Team ’ disappointing this weekend , I was surprised to discover that another 80’s TV show is being readied for a major motion picture .
‘ The Equalizer ’ , a CBS drama back in the day that starred the late Edward Woodward , was a modest hit for the network ( although nowhere near the success of hits like ‘ A - Team ’ ) .
Russell Crowe has attached himself to play the lead character , this according to a story in The L.A. Times .
News on this is early , so we ’ll see where it goes .
This could be good , because I do vaguely remember the show , and Crowe would fit the character nicely .
Other news …’ The Last Airbender ’ has moved its release date up one day to July 1 , 2010 .
‘ Knight and Day ’ has moved its release date up to June 23 , 2010 .
Also , this evening , new trailers for ‘ The Smurfs ’ and ‘ Chronicles of Narnia 3 ’ will be up for viewing .
The US military 's search for a detailed and trustworthy source of information on the hearts and minds of the rural communities of Afghanistan and Pakistan has led them to an unlikely author .
Greg Mortenson is not a politician or special forces guru but a mountaineer turned humanitarian worker whose book Three Cups of Tea has become required reading for the US high command .
The book explains how a failed ascent of K2 led Mortenson to a small village in north - eastern Pakistan .
To show his gratitude to the villagers who looked after him when he came down from the mountain , the American promised to build them a school .
For three years , he lived and worked in the Karakoram mountain villages of northern Pakistan , learning about the Balti people and their culture .
It led to him setting up dozens of schools – mainly for girls – in remote parts of Pakistan and Afghanistan .
The book takes its title from a Balti proverb : " The first time you share tea with a Balti , you are a stranger .
The second time you take tea , you are an honoured guest .
The third time you share a cup of tea , you become family . "
In 1996 , Mortenson co-founded the Central Asia Institute ( CAI ) with Silicon Valley pioneer Jean Hoerni .
CAI , a non-profit organisation , has so far been involved in the establishment or support of 131 schools , which educate more than 58,000 children — 44,000 of them girls .
Three Cups of Tea , subtitled " One Man 's Mission to Promote Peace … One School at a Time " , was published in 2006 and has sold more than 4 m copies around the world .
After proving a hit with the wives of several senior US military men , Mortenson 's book eventually found perhaps its most influential reader : General Stanley McChrystal .
Hours before he flew to Washington to tender his resignation to President Barack Obama following a disastrously outspoken profile in Rolling Stone magazine , McChrystal emailed Mortenson .
" Will move through this and if I 'm not involved in the years ahead , will take tremendous comfort in knowing people like you are helping Afghans build a future , " the outgoing commander said .
McChrystal 's email provided further proof of the profound influence Mortenson 's work has had on US military thinking in the region .
According to the New York Times , Mortenson has spoken at dozens of military bases and had lunch with General David Petraeus , the architect of the US 's Iraq surge and the man chosen to replace McChrystal .
He has also brokered and participated in many meetings between tribal leaders and the US military in the region , where his local knowledge has proved invaluable .
However , Mortenson concedes that forging links with remote communities and helping to educate their children will not alter the situation overnight .
He expects his quest for peace , " one school at a time " , to take a generation .
" But al - Qaida and the Taliban are looking at it long - range over generations , " he told the NYT .
" And we 're looking at it in terms of annual fiscal cycles and presidential elections . "

The now - stable , native Mac version of the beloved Windows client sports a Mac - like UI , designed for downloading many torrents at once , while also being pretty light on system resources .
It does n't look like there are a huge amount of changes between the last few builds and this one , though a few pretty annoying bugs have been fixed , and anyone holding out for a stable version of the client should now be pretty pleased with how it handles .
We have n't done any formal tests yet to compare it to now - Mac - favorite Transmission , but if you 're a heavy torrenter and try out the new build , let us know how it works for you in the comments .
u Torrent is a free download for Mac only .
Note that while the site still says it 's beta , uTorrent has announced it as the stable build on their blog ( and the build numbers match ) .
It seems like they just have n't updated the images on their web site .

Manchester United intend to open contract talks with Wayne Rooney before next month 's start of the Premier League season that would make the England international the highest paid player in the club 's history .
Negotiations over an extension to Rooney 's existing £ 90,000 - a- week deal at Old Trafford , due to expire in 2012 , were put on hold while the 24 - year - old fought a court case against his former representatives Proactive , who had claimed they were owed £ 4.3 m in commission payments .
That case was settled yesterday when Rooney and his wife , Coleen , were ordered to pay Proactive a £ 90,000 " restitutional remedy " , leaving the way clear for United to secure their prized asset on a new long - term contract .
United 's chief executive , David Gill , thanked by Rooney for appearing as a witness on his behalf during the court case , plans to hold talks with the striker and his agent , Paul Stretford , when he returns from the club 's pre-season commitments in North America and Mexico at the end of this month .
United are confident the Croxteth - born striker is happy to continue his trophy - laden career at Old Trafford and hope an agreement can be reached within weeks .
Despite the downturn in spending under the ownership of the Glazer family , United are ready to offer Rooney a lucrative deal that reflects his growing status at Old Trafford .
It is believed the new contract will be worth around £ 130,000 - a- week , eclipsing the £ 120,000 - a- week given to Cristiano Ronaldo in April 2007 and taking him above Rio Ferdinand in the list of United 's current top earners .
While Rooney 's long - term future at United may soon be resolved , Sir Alex Ferguson believes the striker will be haunted by the failure to transfer his talent on to the World Cup stage but does not expect the club to suffer as a consequence next season .
The striker is now recuperating on holiday and will miss United 's pre‑season tour , and Ferguson says Rooney , the France captain , Patrice Evra , and the Serbia defender Nemanja Vidic will face a lasting regret over their performances at the World Cup .
Speaking before the opening game of the tour , against Celtic in Toronto tonight , the United manager said : " I do n't expect a hangover .
I think there will still be a bit of disappointment in the lad .
" I think all the players coming back from the World Cup who did n't do well , who did n't reach their expectations , will feel that they 've missed something .
That 's because the World Cup 's only once every four years .
That 's the horrible part of that tournament .
We have several players who have come back very , very disappointed .
We 've Patrice Evra for instance , Wayne Rooney of course , and Nemanja Vidic . "
The one plus from the World Cup for last season 's Premier League runners‑up , their manager cites , was the impact of the Mexico forward Javier Hernández , who followed his £ 7 m signing from Guadalajara with two goals in the competition against France and Argentina .
Ferguson added : " I think one player who will come back quite positive because he had a good World Cup was young Javier Hernandez from Mexico .
I think he did very well and he surprised a lot of people .
So whereas we 've got some disappointments from players like Wayne , Nemanja and Patrice , I think we 're going to have a positive effect from Javier . "
Deficit concerns have been the major stumbling block to extending unemployment benefits , but cutting off older workers could make the long - term budget outlook worse .
Extending unemployment benefits is n’t free , of course , and has the potential to keep unemployed workers out of jobs for longer .
But it could also be preventing a “ lost generation , ” economists say .
That generation is the crop of 50 - somethings who might have worked for another decade .
Their outlook is n’t bright .
Once older workers are laid off they take the longest to find new jobs .
For workers 65 and up , it takes a median of 45.1 weeks to find a new gig .
For those 55 to 64 , 38.7 weeks .
It takes a slightly shorter 30.4 weeks for those who are 45 to 54 - years old .
Unemployment checks have the added benefit of helping these people feel like they ’re still a part of the labor force .
When the checks run out , and with few glimmers of hope in their job searches , they ’re more likely to drop out of the labor force and turn to a program like disability .
And unlike a relatively short - term fling with jobless benefits , their attachment to disability is more likely to be permanent .
“ Current program incentives make it highly likely that marginally qualified applicants drawn into the program by the business cycle will provide a long - term burden for the disability rolls even if business conditions Improve and the severity of the person ’s disabling condition (s ) does not worsen , ” according to a 1995 study by Kalman Rupp and David Stapleton .
Other studies have shown that for each percentage point increase in the unemployment rate , disability rolls increase anywhere from 2 % to 7 % .
Some studies show that effect grows larger in the following two years .
Those increases , if they prove true again in this recession , could increase the strain on an already stressed disability system .
“ I would worry about a generation basically going onto disability , ” said Phillip Swagel , a former Bush Treasury official and a Georgetown University professor .
But an alternative to help prevent that , instead of continuing jobless benefits , would be the put more money into retraining , he said .
“ We have a strong community college system in this country , ” Mr. Swagel said .
“ That ’s probably the right place to look for how do we avoid writing off a generation . ”
That might not feel like a feasible option , particularly for those in their mid-to - late 50s .
“ At some point it becomes not worth a two - year training program to work another year and a half , ” said Jesse Rothstein , chief economist for the Labor Department .

If you got all your information about Detroit from the blogosphere , the mainstream media , or the photography section of your local bookstore and never actually visited the Motor City , you could be forgiven for assuming that it ’s one giant , bombed - out wasteland .
That ’s certainly the impression conveyed by many of the artists who have been criss - crossing the city over the last few years , lovingly documenting all of the city ’s abandoned factories , houses , schools , and train stations .
As a Michigan native and as one of the people who helped to plan the launch of Xconomy Detroit , I want to lodge a plea : Enough already .
At Xconomy , our focus is on the technology - related enterprises working to ensure a prosperous , sustainable future for Detroit and our other home cities of Boston , San Diego , and Seattle .
That does n’t mean we wear blinders : we know that conditions are desperate in southeast Michigan , and unemployment is out of control .
It will be a long time before the region finds a set of new industries and employers who can bring back anything resembling the auto industry ’s halcyon days from the mid-20th century .
But that ’s exactly why we think the public discussion about Detroit needs to look forward .
If people can focus on innovation rather than decay , renewal rather than ruins , they might just have a better chance of creating something of value .
I ’m not denying that many photos of derelict structures in Detroit have a haunting allure .
The crumbling plaster , peeling paint , and scattered furnishings in these emptied - out buildings lend a sort of texture and poignance that you certainly do n’t get from images of more modern architecture , or even from old pictures of these same Detroit landmarks when they were new .
But I would argue that the texture in these photos is only skin - deep .
What messages are the creators of these images really trying to convey ?
Often , it seems to be little more than a kind of wistfulness , sometimes tinged with schadenfreude .
It ’s just so sad that the city that was once the fourth most populous in the United States is now pervaded by emptiness .
It ’s so shocking what kind of neglect can set in when the bottom falls out of a region ’s economy .
It ’s so ironic that the sort of decay and destruction you might expect to see in Sarajevo or the former East Germany can be found in the heart of an American city .
Like drivers who gawk at an accident on the highway , we ca n’t avert our gaze .
Well , you know what ?
You can find empty , abandoned structures in virtually every city in the U.S. , not to mention the country ’s vast rural stretches .
Abandonment is n’t always the sign of a civilization ’s collapse .
Sometimes it just means that people picked up and left in a hurry .
The only real message you can take from these images is that the real estate these buildings stand on is n’t yet valuable enough to warrant redevelopment .
In the end , most of the images of Detroit ’s abandoned structures have a fetishistic , ultimately unsatisfying quality .
They are the industrial equivalent of necrophilia .
I ca n’t show you the actual photographs of Detroit ’s so - called ruins here , since most of them are copyrighted , but you can find them pretty easily online .
A pair of French photographers , Yves Marchand and Romain Meffre , are among the leading perpetrators — Time Magazine thought their work significant enough to put a whole slideshow online .

Over the last few months donations have been trickling in and gradually piling up .
Since there 's a limit to how much beer we can reasonably drink we 've been brainstorming ideas for using that money to help the project .
One of the ideas we liked the most was to try and sponsor an experimental contest which would hopefully stimulate community TKLPatch development , strengthen the community and teach as many people as possible the skills needed to customize existing TurnKey appliances and create new ones .
It 's not rocket science and you do n't need to be a programmer or systems expert .
Anyone willing to learn a few basic Linux skills can have fun doing it .
If you want we 'll even teach you how !
( details below ) .
We 're thinking of running the contest for the next 8 weeks .
Then allow another 2 weeks to summarize the results and let the community help us decide who should win ( e.g. , a survey on the web site ) .
Prizes
Winners and all honorable mentions will be celebrated in obligatory blog posts , and forever immortalized in the TurnKey hall of fame .
They 'll also receive full bragging rights , the undying gratitude of billions of TurnKey users , and some of our excess beer money on PayPal , which they can claim for themselves or donate to a charity of their choice .
First prize : $ 1,500 $ 100,000 + pony Second prize : $ 800 Third prize : $ 100
Many thanks to everyone who donated to the project !
We 're hoping this will put your money to good use .
If you like the idea and want to increase the contest pot size , feel free to donate now and ask us to dedicate the money to that .
Help us expand the next release
We 're hoping to get lots of high - quality submissions , and if we do , the timing will be just right .
As many of you already know we 're in the middle of a development cycle for the new Lucid and Lenny based beta appliances and we have our hands full upgrading the existing crop of appliances and introducing new features such as backup and migration .
Unfortunately that means this time around we do n't have the resources to expand the appliance library horizontally and add a significant number of new appliances from scratch .
Unless ... well , that 's where our heros come in .
Adding a new appliance to the library from a TKLPatch still requires work , but it 's definitely easier than creating an appliance from scratch and that means we could get more of them done .
In other words , any high - quality TKLPatch submissions we receive from the community in the next couple of months will have a very good chance of being formally adopted into the library in time for the next release .
After that the appliance library will be frozen again for a while until the next release batch .
List of ideas
In no particular order here 's a list of ideas for appliances that have been sitting in our todo list for much too long and probably wo n't make it into the next release without the community 's help :
By function ( components not yet determined ) : terminal server replacement ( I.e. , remote desktops for thin - clients ) , ASP.NET replacement , web filtering proxy ( e.g. privacy , ad - blocking , malware protection , content filtering ) , plug - in e-mail filter ( e.g. , spam / malware ) , unified threat management , load balancing reverse proxies .

If you have your own ideas for appliances you think would make good additions to the TurnKey library , do n't worry if they 're not on the list .
All contributions are welcome .
Work on whatever interests you .
Sign up for a live training session
Creating a TKLPatch is n't hard .
Read the documentation and still not sure where to begin ?
No problem .
If there 's interest , we 'll be giving free live training sessions on TurnKey 's IRC channel showing how to build an example TKLPatch step by step and answering any questions .
Click here to sign up and we 'll send you an e-mail with the time and date of the session .
UPDATE : The session is scheduled for July 25 2010 , 17:00 UTC
A few guidelines
You can improve an existing appliance or create a new appliance by patching any appliance in the TurnKey library , including the new Ubuntu Lucid and Debian Lenny TurnKey Core betas .
If you 're creating a new appliance , we recommend patching the new beta of TurnKey Core based on Ubuntu 10.04 Lucid .
This is the latest version of Ubuntu so it has the newest packages in its software repositories .
It 's preferable to install software through the package management system rather than directly from an upstream tarball .
It 's usually much easier to install and update software this way .
Unfortunately , sometimes this wo n't be an option because there 's a lot of excellent open source software that is n't in Ubuntu 's or Debian 's package repositories .
In these cases try checking if the software you 're looking for is at least available as a Debian package ( *.deb ) .
If not , that 's OK .
An appliance does n't have to be perfect to be useful .
In case it is n't obvious , if you include software from outside the official package repositories , make sure it 's available under an open source license ( e.g. , GPL , BSD , etc. ) .
Free as in free beer is not enough .
Software in official TurnKey appliances must also be free as in liberty .
Publish results as soon as you have them on the forum and / or development wiki .
In general , credit for a result goes to the first person who publishes .
This does n't even have to be a finished TKLPatch , though naturally finished , high - quality submissions count moure than partial results .
To avoid duplicated effort , check the development wiki before you start working on a new TKLPatch .
Maybe it 's already been submitted .
But if you think you can make something better , do n't let that stop you !
You can work alone , or collaborate as part of a group .
Your choice .
There 's no need to register .
If you 're part of a group , just document who should take credit ( e.g. , Hans Solo , Star Wars group ) .
Results will be evaluated based on a quality and quantity of all submissions , including any integration notes , TKLPatches , or documentation submitted .
At the end we 'll summarize the results of all participants and set up community surveys to help us decide who should win .
Have fun !

Yesterday we had a quick squiz at the profitability of the Australian mining industry compared to both other domestic industries as well as the world ’s largest 40 mining companies .
Today , it ’s worth a taking a closer look at how mining industry profitability in Australia plays out on the basis of business size as well as a look at the proportion of all mining firms that are actually profitable .
The ABS “ Australian Industry ” report released last month not only provides data on Sales and Service Revenue and Operating Profit Before Tax ( OPBT ) for the mining industry as a whole in Australia – with the ABS dividing the latter by the former to give us its definition of profit margin – but also provides that data broken down into business size cohorts within the Australian mining industry .
The ABS uses three business size categories here :
Small – businesses which employ less than 20 people
Medium – business which employ between 20 and 199 people
Large – businesses which employ 200 people or more .
If we look at the profit margins of the mining industry broken down by those business sizes , as well as the share of sales and service revenue and share of OPBT that each cohort experienced , this is what we get :
For some context , we ’ll repost the chart from yesterday that compares how other industries are performing on the identical measure of “ profit margin ” :
As we can see , the small and medium sized mining firms are experiencing profits comparable to other Australian industries ( albeit with medium sized firms at the top of the rest of the pack ) – but large sized mining firms come in at a massive 46.1 % aggregate profit margin .
Keep that in your thought orbit while we take a quick detour .
The ABS also reports in that publication the proportion of all firms in a given industry classification that are profitable .
If we look at the proportion of profitable firms across Australian industries , this is what we get :
This is where it gets particularly interesting .
Only 51.2 % of all mining firms were actually profitable in 2008/ 9 – the lowest of all industry classifications – even though the industry wide aggregate profit margin for mining was the highest for any industry classification in Australia , coming in at a whopping 37.1 % , and where the aggregate profit margin for large mining firms was an even larger 46.1 %
So what we are seeing is an odd distribution of profits in the mining industry where a relatively small number of mostly large firms attracted massive profit margins ( pushing the industry aggregate up substantially ) , while a large number of firms attracted only moderate profits , and a very large number of firms – 46.9 % – made a loss .
It would be accurate to say here that a majority of firms – and probably a very large majority of firms at that – would actually be better off under the proposed RSPT than the existing regime .
The design of the RSPT is such that it wo n’t make any currently profitable firm unprofitable ( the larger a firms profit , the larger the slice of that profit the government ultimately takes ) – but what it will do as part of its design is make some currently unprofitable firms profitable as a result of not charging firms for exploiting Australian minerals until they are profitable on the one hand , and the way the new Resource Exploration Rebate operates on the other .
Unless the collective management of the entire mining industry were dropped on their head when they were babies and its causing them to operate on the basis of something other than economic self interest in this debate , the hysteria coming from those purporting to represent the mining industry would appear to only be representative of a very , very small collection of mostly large and extraordinarily profitable firms – firms that have pushed the industry aggregate profit margin up to 37.1 % and the profit margin of firms employing more than 200 people up to 46.1 % , even though an astonishing 46.9 % of all mining firms were actually unprofitable at the time !
When Mitch Hooke , Twiggy Forrest , Clive Palmer and the gaggle of usual suspects start whinging about the RSPT – remember exactly who they are representing , because it certainly is n’t the economic interests of the majority of mining firms in Australia .

There has been much talk about how to clean up the oil in the Gulf of Mexico .
Yet , so far there there seems to have been more talk than action .
There is a potential partial solution and I have no idea why it has not been implemented .
Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal wanted to build sand berms to keep the oil away from coastal regions but he has been denied in most instances .
Something about waiting for an environmental impact study .
Meanwhile , the environment is getting impacted .
Relief wells have been started but may not be complete until the end of July .
In the meantime , there is a proven technology to more effectively remove the oil from the Gulf of Mexico .
It was used 20 years ago but kept a secret .
In the last few weeks , many people have become aware of it including all of the principals in this ecodrama ; those in industry , military , political .
Yet , so far , no one seems to have lifted a finger to make this maxium effort .
There has been no reason given why no one seems to want to act .
Okay … I do have one idea about why no one has called on the proven technology but its so cynical I refuse to believe it .
In any event , the lack of action may be changing … about 5 weeks behind schedule .
The largest oil spill in world history is generally recognized to be that which resulted from the Persian Gulf War in 1990 .
The Iraqis were concerned about a potential amphibious invasion by the United States Marine Corps .
They let loose a strategy of opening the valves at the Sea Island oil terminal so that the oil would foul that water to such an extent that it would limit the American ’s ability to conduct amphibious operations .
The Americans reacted by bombing the island facility to stop the flow of oil but there were also a couple of damaged oil tankers and a damaged Kuwaiti oil refinery that added to the pollution .
In most oil spills , it is almost impossible for anyone to give a concrete number relating to amounts of oil lost , yet the media always demands one .
In general , the estimates for the Persian Gulf oil spill run around 11 million barrels .
The Exxon Valdez spill was estimated at 11 million gallons .
So , this was 42 times bigger .
A few weeks ago I reported on the Ixtoc I oil well blowout and it put out something on the order of about half that of the Persian spill .
In 1993 , the New York Times reported that a study sponsored by many nations concluded that the spill produced “ little long term damage . ”
It said that half the oil evaporated , about a million barrels was recovered and 2 or 3 million barrels washed up on the shore .
But , in 2010 , Dr. Jaqueline Michel said that studies indicated that oil remains in the wetland areas of the Persian Gulf and that oil had penetrated deeply into the intertidal sediment .
Hence , the belief is that the area will take decades to recover .
Here ’s the funny thing .
While the New York Times was reporting on the study regarding the 1990 Persian Gulf Oil spill , oil was flowing into the Persian Gulf .
When Dr. Michel reported on the long term effects of the Gulf War spill , nothing was said about how it was determined the oil found was indeed from the 1990 spill and not perhaps another large spill .
Perhaps no one asked the question and the New York Times was silent because no one knew about the very large spill in the Persian Gulf in 1993 .
The Unknown Oil Spill :
It is very difficult to find answers regarding the spill because the Saudi government kept it quiet and told those working with Saudi Aramco to keep quiet .
That means that Royal Dutch Shell kept it under wraps .
The Exxon Valdez resulted in 11 million gallons of oil into the Alaska waters .
There is no way that anyone could hide that , right ?
Well , either the Saudis are a bunch of Houdinis or they paid a lot of people to look the other way because this spill was estimated to have dumped some 800 millon gallons of oil into the Persian Gulf .
Yet , who knew ?
Those who did know kept it quiet .
Tiger Woods should have hired the Saudis for public relations because they managed to keep their little disaster out of the press .
However , part of the reason that no one heard about it was that action was taken .
The Unknown Supertanker Skimmers : Saudi Arabia is the largest owner of supertankers in the world .
Apparently , what they did was develop a method in which super tankers act as giant vacuums to draw in millions of gallons of seawater .
Oil is separated from the water .
The water is put back in the ocean and the oil is recovered for production .
In this particular case , apparently about 85 % of the oil lost was eventually recovered .
Much of the rest probably evaporated or otherwise broke up .
From an observer , the results would match with those associated with a relatively minor spill and not the gigantic catastrophe that was reality .
To be certain , this was not a quick fix .
According to an article from Esquire , the initial skimming operation took about 6 months and the total clean up effort lasted for several more years .
Now , the former CEO of Shell and a former engineer with Saudi Aramco have been try to get media attention regarding the potential clean up method .
They also have tried to get the US Government and BP ’s attention of anyone else who will listen .
Esquire reported late in May that President Obama is aware of the methodology because ABC ’s Jake Tapper asked him a question regarding the procedure at a recent press conference .
Apparently the response was not comprehensive .
BP is aware of the procedure because the article claims that BP is now actually considering the strategy .
Esquire also says that a leading oilman from Houston , Matthew Simmons , has been out beating the bushes urging someone to utilize the technology currently available .
And , Esquire has made certain that the US Coast Guard is aware of the procedure and supertanker skimming capability because the magazine actually sent a letter to the Coast Guard asking about possible implementation .
Communities along the Alabama Coast inquired about the procedure and first contacted Esquire for details ; not the government , BP or the Coast Guard .
I suppose they figure that if someone else wo n’t use what is available to protect their coast , the wildlife and many jobs then they will go out and find out how to do it themselves .
Environmental Battleship :
This whole idea even goes back before the 1993 Saudi spill .
After I first reported a month ago on the history of the IXTOC I blowout in the Gulf of Mexico and how it related to the current Deepwater Horizon incident , I received a press release ( followed by a second ) from an outfit in South Louisiana .
In my mind , clearly they are trying to use this incident to promote their project .
But , if one is to believe the release , following the Exxon Valdez accident , the government called for new methods to respond to oil catastrophes .
Herman J. Schellstede & Associates , Inc. said in their release that Mr. Schellstede responded with the design of a ship dedicated to the skimming and processing of sea water similar to that of Aramco .
I ’m not certain if its quite the same because it ’s hard to determine if the supertankers process the water on board whereas Mr. Schellstede says that his “ Sea Clean ” vessel would process 38,000 gallons of water per minute for on - board treatment .
I think the supertankers can take on more water but they ca n’t treat the water on board , which is an advantage for the “ Sea Clean . ”
The release says that in the early 90’s , the South Louisiana company received the proper permits to begin building the ship when suddenly interest waned .
There was no more push from the government and the oil companies apparently felt that it was hard to justify spending tens of millions of dollars for a ship that they may never need .
After all , there have been thousands of oil wells drilled in the Gulf and there have been very few that have blown out .
This boat was not a secret either .
There is a new Youtube video of the “ Sea Clean ” as well as an article in a 1991 edition of Popular Mechanics that touted the potential of Mr. Schellestede ’s vessel .
Before that , in November 1989 , just months after the March 24 , 1989 Exxon Valdez accident , the New York Times said in an article that “ a huge vessel now on the drawing board could someday serve as what its designers call an environmental battleship , attacking oil spills like the Exxon Valdez disaster in Alaska . ”
It ’s still on the drawing board .
So , in 1989 the government asked for new methods to react to large offshore oil disasters .
An American company in South Louisiana came up with a solution .
The birds chirped .
A big oil disaster in the Persian Gulf was averted in 1993 by using a similar technology but no one knew about it because of a Public Relations effort of the Saudi Arabians .
The Saudis have the largest fleet of supertankers in the world and the US has certainly come to the security of interests of that nation enough times that they could spare a few tankers for awhile .
So , the tankers could be made available .
The technology is proven and available .
We know for certain now that BP knows about it , the US Coast Guard knows about it , the US Government knows about it , the President of the United States knows about it and even Larry King knows about it .
Yet , the birds continue to chirp …. those who can chirp as others struggle to lift their oil soaked heads .
I ’m not sure why it ca n’t be done but it seems an easy plan would be for BP to handle the plugging of the well .
That should be their only focus because its extremely difficult at such bone crushing , frigid depths .
The Coast Guard could be in charge of the clean up and containment and use the influence of the state department to help persuade the Saudis to get those supertankers over here .
The Energy Department can be talking to the folks in South Louisiana about what it would take to build the vessel proposed .
The Justice Department and Congress should stand down for a while .
It used to drive me crazy when , during a difficult TV show , people would start yelling at each other over problems while the show was still in progress .
That disrupted more of the show .
I would always urge that we get through the show and then start pointing fingers afterward .
So far , the “ action ” we ’ve seen has been hearings , finger pointing and lawsuits , threats of lawsuits and threats of criminal trials with very little “ action ” concerning fixing the problem and finding the answers later .
No one has considered that this was no one ’s fault … that there is an inherent danger at drilling at such water depths .
Regardless , we need to get this thing stopped …. and it wo n’t be easy … it took 9 months at IXTOC I and that was only a few hundred feet of water , not over 5000 feet .
Lets put 100 % of the resources toward plugging the hole then maybe the birds will chirp again .
Hopefully theywill chirp because emergency planning will not just be talked about but followed through with this time .
Sir Richard Branson soaks up the atmosphere on the Monaco grid © Sutton Images Enlarge
Sir Richard Branson 's interest in his Virgin Racing F1 team has been given a kick start after he realised there was £ 17 million at stake for finishing 10th in the constructors ' championship .
Under the Concorde Agreement the top ten teams in Formula
One share 50 % of the sport 's underlying profits that comes from revenue sources such as TV rights and trackside advertising .
The higher a team finishes the more it gets , with tenth place receiving £ 17 million but 11th and 12th place receiving nothing at all .
The three new teams will almost certainly occupy the bottom three places in the championship , meaning one of them is set to land a £ 17 million windfall when it beats the others .
Branson said he had not been aware of the money up for grabs .
" There 's some money ?
You never told me that ! "
Branson is quoted by BBC Sport after being told about the cash by Virgin Racing CEO Graeme Lowdon .
" It does make a difference .
Whereas I said I would n't mind about tenth place , I 've suddenly taken a big interest ! "
Lowdon added : " It [ the prize - money formula ] is an innovative structure , and if you do well on the track then you get very well rewarded . "
Virgin currently lies last in the standings because , although none of the bottom three have scored any points , Lotus and HRT have secured higher placed finishes so far .
Despite Virgin 's slow start , including 10 retirements in the first eight races , Branson is proud of how far his team had come .
" One year ago we only got our licence , so this racing company was a piece of paper back then , " he said .
" We then had to scramble to find the people and build the car , and I think the team has since done well . "
Going back with Michael Leighton will be a big mistake for the Flyers .
They are a deep team that has the potential to make it back to the Stanley Cup and they ca n’t afford to risk this on a shaky goalie .
If Patrick Kane ’s Cup winning goal was n’t enough to prove to you that Leighton is shaky then I ’m not sure what will .
Plus , the Flyers are so rich at forward that they can risk giving up someone important without losing a beat .
I ’m talking about Jeff Carter .
Wait !
Hear me out .
Earlier in the season I said it would be stupid for the Flyers to trade Carter at the deadline for a goalie .
But at that time the Flyers had Michael Leighton playing well ( which I do n’t think he can replicate ) and Danny Briere and Claude Giroux had yet to play out of their minds .
Giroux 's emergence and Briere 's revival make Carter expendable .
It ’s almost unfathomable to think that a 25 - year - old capable of scoring 40 + goals a year is expendable , but that ’s the reality , mainly because of the Flyers ’ cap situation .
If the Flyers want to improve their goaltending they will need money .
The Flyers will have about $ 8 - 10 million in cap space next season depending on how much the salary cap increases .
But they have seven roster spots to fill , one of which is a number one goalie ( Michael Leighton is a UFA ) .
Two of those roster spots are for Carcillo and Coburn , who are RFAs , and will receives salary increases ( Coburn especially ) .
You can see their dilemma .
To free up cap space they can try and trade Danny Briere , but he still had five years left at $ 6.5 million , which I think is too onerous for anyone to take even after the playoffs he had .
Plus , he has a NTC .
Scott Hartnell is another option , but he too has a NTC and I ’m not sure he will be willing to waive it to leave a team capable of making the Stanley Cup again .
He also brings a physical play to the Flyers that is integral .
Simon Gagne is more likely , but he also has a NTC ( surprise ! ) and would not net the type of return that Jeff Carter would because he ’s older and has a history of injuries .
Plus , Jeff Carter is probably most effective as a centre based on his poor play on the wing in the Final .
Although , his poor play could also be the result of playing on a partially healed broken foot .
If he needs to play centre to be most effective there does n’t seem to be room for him on the Flyers since they have Richards , Briere , and Giroux from lines 1 to 3 .
I know he ’s better than Briere , but Briere is n’t going anywhere .
The Flyers can either directly trade Jeff Carter for a goalie or they can sign a free agent and deal Carter to make cap room while filling other needs .
One interesting trade candidate is Carey Price .
There is no way that the Canadiens can choose Price over Halak ( since there is no way both want to be back in the same situation next year ) .
Montreal fans have already turned on Price and that was before Halak played out of his mind in the playoffs .
Price is still very young and I ’m certain can bounce back with a change of scenery ; although , Philadelphia might not be the best place considering their history of goalies and the demanding nature of their fans .
Obviously , Jeff Carter is worth more than Carey Price in a trade , so the Flyers are in a position to receive a return of more than just Price .
They certainly have a need for defensive depth since Peter Laviolette had absolutely no faith in his third pairing during the regular season and the playoffs .
Does Carter for Price , a defenceman , and a prospect / pick sound about right ?
Perhaps the Flyers could call on the Panthers for Tomas Vokoun or the Bruins for Tim Thomas .
Although , both Thomas and Vokoun have large cap hits and are over 30 .
If the Flyers choose to go the UFA route they could sign Dan Ellis , Evgeni Nabokov , or Marty Turco .
Nabokov does n’t have the playoff pedigree and should n't be trusted .
Turco has n't actually posted a season with a save percentage above .915 since the lockout .
Ellis will probably be the cheapest of the three , but is somewhat of a gamble considering he does n’t have a long and impressive track record .
If the Flyers choose to sign a goalie they will need to make a trade unless they can somehow manage to fill all their needs with their limited cap space .
This is n’t likely considering number one goalies are n’t cheap .
A big contract has to go .
It has been rumoured that the Columbus Blue Jackets are open to dealing the fourth overall pick .
Trading Carter to the Blue Jackets for this pick plus players could make sense for both teams .
The Flyers get a blue - chip prospect who can become an impact player in the near future , and , more importantly , wo n’t affect the salary cap .
This gives them the room to upgrade their goaltending and hopefully make a return to the Final .
Columbus gets a young impact player who can help them get back into the playoffs and hopefully sell hockey to Columbus .
In a perfect world the Flyers will be able to deal Simon Gagne and keep Jeff Carter or even find a more creative solution to their cap problems that allows them to keep both .
I just do n’t think this is possible if the Flyers want an upgrade in goal .
Acquiring Carey Price has the potential to solidify the Flyers netminding for the next decade , but could also torpedo the Flyers if Price is unable to regain the form that caused fans to call him Jesus in Montreal .
But hockey is not for the faint of heart .
This is a risk , but I think will pay off for the Flyers .
Somebody pass this along to Paul Holmgren .
A controversy is brewing in Saudi Arabia over a new fatwa issued that advocates , er , adult breastfeeding .
From AOL
News :
Sheikh Al Obeikan , an adviser to the royal court and consultant to the Ministry of Justice , set off a firestorm of controversy recently when he said on TV that women who come into regular contact with men who are n't related to them ought to give them their breast milk so they will be considered relatives .
" The man should take the milk , but not directly from the breast of the woman , " Al Obeikan said , according to Gulf News .
" He should drink it and then becomes a relative of the family , a fact that allows him to come in contact with the women without breaking Islam 's rules about mixing . "
Obeikan said the fatwa applied to men who live in the same house or come into contact with women on a regular basis , except for drivers .
Al Obeikan , who made the statement after being asked on TV about a 2007 fatwa issued by an Egyptian scholar about adult breast - feeding , said that the breast milk ought to be pumped out and given to men in a glass .
But his remarks were followed by an announcement by another high - profile sheik , Abi Ishaq Al Huwaini , who said that men should suckle the breast milk directly from a woman 's breast .
Wenn es noch eines Symbols für die Radikalisierung der früheren Nachrichtensprecherin Eva Herman bedurft hätte , hat sie es heute mit ihrem Kommentar zur Katastrophe auf der Love Parade selbst geliefert .
Eva Herman vermutet , dass vielleicht ein Akt Gottes dafür gesorgt hat , dass es zu der tödlichen Massenpanik kam , um auf diese Weise die sündige Veranstaltung , das „ Sodom und Gomorrha “ , für immer zu beenden .
Sie formuliert es so :
(… ) das amtliche Ende der „ geilsten Party der Welt “ , der Loveparade , dürfte mit dem gestrigen Tag besiegelt worden sein !
Eventuell haben hier ja auch ganz andere Mächte mit eingegriffen , um dem schamlosen Treiben endlich ein Ende zu setzen .
Ursprünglich war an dieser Stelle in ihrem Artikel ein Foto von zwei knutschenden Frauen zu sehen .
Vielleicht war das kein Zufall .
Vielleicht hat der grausame Gott , an den Eva Herman glaubt , nicht nur etwas gegen Zügellosigkeit , Drogenmissbrauch und schlechte Musik , sondern ganz speziell auch gegen Homosexualität .
Unwahrscheinlich erscheint mir das nicht .
Schuld an den Toten sind nach Ansicht von Eva Herman letztlich die Achtundsechziger .
Die unheilvollen Auswüchse der Jetztzeit sind , bei Licht betrachtet , vor allem das Ergebnis der Achtundsechziger , die die Gesellschaft „ befreit “ haben von allen Zwängen und Regeln , welche das „ Individuum doch nur einengen “ .
Wer sich betrunken und mit Drogen vollgedröhnt die Kleider vom Leib reißt , wer die letzten Anstandsrnormen feiernd und tanzend einstürzen lässt , und wer dafür auch noch von den Trägern der Gesellschaft unterstützt wird , der ist nicht weit vom Abgrund entfernt .
Die Achtundsechziger haben ganze Arbeit geleistet !
Eva Herman meint , am Tag nach dem Tag , an dem 19 Menschen unter furchtbaren und letztlich noch ungeklärten Umständen ums Leben gekommen sind und Hunderte verletzt wurden , müsse man die Frage stellen nach der Verdorbenheit der Veranstaltung an sich , die für sie auch als Ursache für das Unglück festzustehen scheint .
Eva Herman glaubt , dass man in diesem Land quasi gezwungen war , die Love Parade gutfinden zu müssen :
Kritik an dieser Veranstaltung war schließlich auch schon in den letzten Jahren politisch unkorrekt .
Eva Herman liefert für diese erstaunliche
These keinelei Beleg , aber den braucht sie auch nicht .
Eva Herman wird , wenn sie nun von vielen Menschen für ihren dummen und unanständigen
Text angegriffen wird , das als weiteren Beweis dafür sehen , dass es in diesem Land Denk - und Sprechverbote gibt .
Dabei darf sie das alles denken und sagen .
Und ich darf sie dafür verachten .
WASHINGTON 
When he ordered 30,000 additional troops to Afghanistan last December , President Obama stressed that they would not stay forever .
“ After 18 months , ” he said , “ our troops will begin to come home . ”
Last weekend , though , he scorned the “ obsession around this whole issue of when do we leave , ” saying he was focused on making sure the troops were successful .
The July 2011 deadline he set was intended to “ begin a process of transition , ” he said , but “ that does n’t mean we suddenly turn off the lights and let the door close behind us . ”
As he hands command of the war to Gen. David H. Petraeus , Mr. Obama is trying to define what his timeline means  but not too much .
Even as developments in Afghanistan have made meeting the deadline all the more daunting , Mr. Obama has sent multiple signals to multiple audiences , sticking by his commitment to begin pulling out while insisting that it does not mean simply walking away .
But if he is maintaining maximum flexibility with deliberate ambiguity , the conflicting emphasis has left many wondering just what will happen next summer .
The question dominated General Petraeus ’s last appearance on Capitol Hill two weeks ago when he testified as head of the United States Central Command overseeing the region .
And it may flavor his return on Tuesday to the Senate Armed Services Committee as it moves to confirm his new assignment as commander of coalition forces in Afghanistan .

Infusing all shades of rock into a “ twisted ” and “ experimental ” musical incarnation is a long - anticipated and newly embarked project – to feature Porcupine Tree ’s Steven Wilson , Opeth ’s Mikael Akerfeldt , as well as Dream Theater ’s Mike Portnoy .
In a recent interview with Chordstruck Magazine , Wilson explained how the project is still “ in [ its ] very early days , ” as he is currently getting the concepts out and onto the paper , drafting the first few tunes with Akerfeldt .
Thus far , both European progressive metal masterminds have churned out “ 15 minutes of music ” in Wilson ’s London studio .
Now , Akerfeldt , Wilson , and Portnoy – are dudes that keep themselves busy , dabbling in dissection with all types of music – exemplified by and ranging from the traditional death metal calls of Bloodbath ’s Resurrection Through Carnage , through to the progressive , experimental tunes of records like Dream Theater ’s When Dream and Day Unite , and Opeth ’s My Arms , Your Hearse .
Nonetheless , zooming in on the present and collaborative effort at hand , Portnoy added that , in spite of their more traceably progressive metal backgrounds , “ people are going to be very surprised by the direction ” – especially those who may spin the record with expectations of the “ death - metal - progressive rock ” feel .
He assured readers of this , so too that “ if you put the two of [ both Wilson and Akerfeldt ] together , ” the “ last thing [ they ’d ] do is something similar to what people already known from our most high - profile project . ”
In short , they itch to innovate , forever avoiding that easier but all - too common path of writing music that is predictable , familiar , and perhaps more welcomed by their established fanbases .

Scroll to continue reading .
Despite the fact that the duo ( and soon to be , trio ) intends to venture into the more “ mellower ” and less “ prog ” sonic realms , they have promised that their direction is “ arty…ambitious , ” and inevitably , “ epic ” – undoubtedly “ dark ” – a sure - fire way to hook listeners on the deliberate melodies and the introspective lyrics that gave both musicians a solid status in the musical world .
They have walked into the studio’s with the intent of doing “ something really , really special and really different ” – a desire that they have kept in mind for years .
Added Portnoy in a 2009 interview with Pyromusic.net , “ the three of us each mentioned wanting to work with each other years ago , and since then it ’s kind of been this rumor that wo n’t go away . ”
Rumor - turned reality ?
Not quite , as he also explained how the exponential “ hype and anticipation ” has ironically made them “ hesitant ” to go forward with the project .
Perfectionists as they are , it ’s due to the overwhelming reception from a record that has barely been drafted , to - date , that they feel the hype has “ surpassed anything [ they can ] realistically deliver . ”
As opposed to a more silent and understated entry of new music into the libraries and flowing from the headphones of music listeners , Portnoy attributed the excitement to the Internet , on which news and music getting “ leaked ” is an increasingly common phenomenon : often a source of bliss for beloved yet impatient fans , and a royal nuisance for bands ( and their loving labels ) .
He vehemently critiqued such “ leaks ” and the internet for too often “ [ opening ] up [ a ] can of worms of discussion , ” after which “ people starting discussing and discussing and discussing and dissecting and anticipating …[ building ] up such a level of hype and expectation in their head that it ’s impossible to ever satisfy . ”
As far as expectations are concerned , Portnoy and Wilson wish to keep the project ’s growth “ under the lid , ” but have promised that they “ would love to work together ” and get it all together , synthesizing a record that ’s “ different ” as anything they ’ve ever made but essentially , and perhaps most crucially , straight rockin . ’
The IT Crowd creator Graham Linehan has revealed that he tries to avoid character progression on the show .
Speaking to Sky , the writer explained that lead roles Roy ( Chris O'Dowd ) , Moss ( Richard Ayoade ) and Jen ( Katherine Parkinson ) never learn from their mistakes .
" There 'll be no hugging , no learning , no character arcs and no - one gets any wiser , " he said .
" I 'm keeping them in a state of nervous stasis I guess .
" I 've tried to continue the idea that Roy , Moss and Jen are becoming better friends and are enjoying each other 's company a bit more . "
He also applauded the " great cast " and credited the show 's variety of styles for its continued success .
" There 's an unspoken belief among too many people , including writers , that scripts are just dialogue when actually they are also about what happens visually , " he explained .
" For example , the big set piece moments … they 're usually visual .
So I always try and keep the dynamic going of visual joke followed by dialogue passage , followed by one - liner , followed by musical joke , and so on , just to keep it interesting and have dynamics . "
The fourth series of The IT Crowd is currently airing on Channel 4 .

The America John Boehner grew up in ?
Check out the GOP platforms at the time
Ever since John Boehner accused Dems last week of " snuffing out the America that I grew up in , " people around the Web have taking stabs at defining the America of Boehner 's youth .
On a slow news day , here 's another contribution : Let 's check out the Republican Party platforms of Boehner 's childhood and formative years , which reveal a GOP that was very different from the party Boehner helps lead today .
Boehner was born in 1949 .
In 1956 , he was seven ; in 1960 he was 11 ; and in 1964 he was 15 .
* The Republican Party platform of 1956 called for " broadened coverage in unemployment insurance " and " better health protection for all our people . "
It vowed to " continue vigorously to support the United Nations . "
It pledged support for " progressive programs " to expand workers ' rights .
It vowed an immigration policy that ensured that America would remain a " haven for oppresssed peoples . "
* The Republican Party platform of 1960 hailed the GOP 's success in extending unemployment insurance .
The GOP counted as an achievement its efforts to raise the Federal minimum wage .
The platform hailed expanded Social Security coverage and pledged an aggressive Federal effort to help those struggling with health care costs ( in those pre-Medicare days , the primary focus was on the elderly ) .
It pledged to continue robust Federal intervention to preserve the environment .
The outlines of today 's GOP became more visible in the Republican Party platform of 1964 , which makes sense , since it came after Lyndon Johnson assumed the presidency .
It decried Johnson 's efforts to expand the Federal government and called for more market - based solutions to poverty .
Johnson 's War on Poverty and the passage of the Civil Rights Act , of course , led to GOP control of the south and started the party down the road to the conservatism we associate with it today .
Of course , it 's also true that in some respects the America Boehner grew up in was a far more right wing country , particular when it came to what constituted acceptable treatment of minorities , gays and women .
But as Mike Tomasky notes , the Republican Party of Boehner 's youth was fairly moderate and embraced Big Government spending -- a far cry from today 's GOP .
Contemporary conservatism was merely a gleam in Bill Buckley 's eye .
If this is what Boehner is nostalgic for , that would be news indeed ...
Study finds that simple 2 - question survey can better identify hungry children
Asking parents just two simple screening questions could help health care providers and social workers to easily and quickly identify families whose young children are suffering from hunger , enabling early interventions that could prevent serious health consequences , according to a new study led by University of Maryland School of Medicine researchers .
The study , published July 1 in the journal Pediatrics , analyzed data gathered from more than 30,000 families nationwide , about a quarter of whom suffered from hunger .
The researchers examined whether the time - consuming , 18 - question Household Food Security Survey provided by the federal government could be shortened and still be effective in identifying hungry families .
They found that just the first two statements , with which families were asked to agree or disagree , were key : " Within the past 12 months we worried whether our food would run out before we got money to buy more ; " and " Within the past 12 months the food we bought just did n't last and we did n't have money to get more . "
The researchers found that 92.5 percent of the hungry families answered " yes " to the first question , and 81.9 percent of the families answered yes to the second , meaning that positive answers to those questions alone could accurately identify most families affected by hunger .
Such an efficient screening test can save time and get help to more hungry families faster , according to lead author Erin Hager , Ph.D. , assistant professor of pediatrics at the University of Maryland School of Medicine .
" This paper is the evidence that it works , " Dr. Hager says .
" Now , this can immediately be used by any social service agency or any clinic to more quickly get hungry children connected with the assistance they need to stay nourished , healthy and developmentally on track . "
Hunger can be invisible in American children because they do not physically appear skinny or emaciated , according to senior author Maureen Black , Ph.D. , the John A. Scholl , M.D. , and Mary Louise Scholl , M.D. , Professor of Pediatrics at the University of Maryland School of Medicine .
" Unlike hungry children in Third World countries who may go without food , American parents have access to cheap , nutrient - deprived foods they can use to fill their children 's bellies and maintain their weight .
However , without critical nutrients such as iron , babies and toddlers can suffer from serious health consequences . "
Health care professionals rarely ask parents if they have enough nutritious food to feed their families .
" People who are hungry and who can't feed their kids are often anxious and depressed , " says Dr. Black .
" They do n't feel good about this — food is a basic need you 're supposed to provide for your children . "
Identifying hungry children and intervening early is so important because of the serious health effects kids can suffer without proper nutrition .
Children younger than three who live in food - insecure households are 90 percent more likely to be in fair or poor health ( versus good or excellent health ) than children in food - secure homes .
Hungry babies and toddlers are 31 percent more likely to have been hospitalized since birth , and 76 percent more likely to be at increased developmental risk than children in food - secure homes .
A quick , easy way of identifying hungry families can help them get assistance before the hunger seriously impacts the children 's health .
" Food stamps , welfare and programs like WIC can provide these families with nutrient - rich food to avoid the negative consequences of hunger , " says Dr. Black .
The researchers hope social workers , health professionals and other outreach workers who come in contact with needy families will begin using the quiz right away , and will immediately seek help for those who need it .
Health care professionals in Baltimore can use a Web site set up by the City Health Department ( www.hungryinbaltimore.org) to identify nutritional resources for families who are at risk for food insecurity .
The study was conducted as part of Children 's HealthWatch ( www.childrenshealthwatch.org), a nationwide consortium of urban medical centers devoted to monitoring how national policies and environmental conditions affect the health , growth and development of children under three years of age .
Working in emergency departments and pediatric primary care clinics , Children 's HealthWatch interviewers asked 30,098 families all 18 questions on the U.S. Household Food Security Scale .
The scale is a survey developed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to track food insecurity in America .
About 23 percent of the families who participated were food insecure .
Dr. Black and colleagues analyzed the families ' responses to all 18 questions see if fewer queries could be just as definitive as the full survey .
The responses to the first two questions accurately identified the vast majority of hungry families .
The researchers evaluated statistical factors and found a sensitivity of 97 percent , meaning that only three percent of families who experience food insecurity were likely to be misclassified as food - secure using the two - question survey .
The results are encouraging , and the new test can be implemented right away , says Dr. Black .
" We 're hoping our findings will immediately enable clinics and other outreach centers screen families for food insecurity , " she says .
" We want children and their parents to get help as soon as they can to prevent long - term health and developmental consequences . "
" This study is an example of how taking an innovative approach to evaluating existing methods can help us find a better way and improve human health , " says E. Albert Reece , M.D. , Ph.D. , M.B.A. , vice president for medical affairs , University of Maryland , and John Z. and Akiko K. Bowers Distinguished Professor and dean , University of Maryland School of Medicine .
" We are confident these findings will have an immediate impact on the health of America 's babies and toddlers .
We 're proud of Dr. Black 's work toward a better life for children who are at risk . "
SDCC : Whedon Confirms
He is Directing The Avengers
Confirmation During The Visionaries Panel
We all were hoping that the talk was true ; and today Joss Whedon made it official .
He is directing The Avengers film .
Many sources , including Comic Book Resources , are citing Whedon 's declaration during the Entertainment Weekly : The Visionaries panel with J.J. Abrams today at Comic - Con .
When questioned about his involvement with the film , Whedon responded :
“ That is not an official thing .
But I ’m making that an official thing : I ’m directing The Avengers . ”
Whedon had long been involved in talk surrounding the movie , including the Edward Norton / Hulk situation .
Today , we can all breathe a sigh of relief knowing Earth 's Mightiest Heroes are in good hands .
The Avengers is scheduled to be released on May 4 , 2012 and will star Chris Evans as Captain America , Robert Downey , Jr. as Iron Man , Chris Hemsworth as Thor , Scarlett Johansen as the Black Widow and Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury .
Brandon Gibb ’s research could provide new weapons for the fight against childhood depression .
Working with colleagues around the country , he hopes to identify the causes of mental - health problems in kids and define trajectories of risk for depression .
“ We ’re hoping not only to identify which risk factors are most important but also to determine a developmental window that may provide the best opportunity for intervention , ” said Gibb , associate professor of psychology at Binghamton University and director of its Mood Disorders Institute .
During the next five years , Gibb and his colleagues will study 250 8 - to 14 - year - olds and their mothers to develop a better understanding of the genetic , environmental and psychological variables that can lead to depression .
They ’ve received funding from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development , part of the National Institutes of Health , to support the $ 2.06 million project .
The first two years of the grant , $ 874,859 , will come through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act ( ARRA ) .
People are at risk for depression if something bad happens to them , Gibb explained .
It ’s as simple – and as complicated – as that .
“ But we also know there is huge variability in which people get depressed when terrible things happen to them , ” he said .
“ What we ’re interested in is how people think about the things that happen in their lives as this mechanism of risk . ”
These differences in thought patterns – or information - processing biases – fascinate Gibb .
“ Let ’s say you have a fight with a friend , ” he said .
“ You can say , ‘ Oh the friend was just in a bad mood and he ’ll probably be back tomorrow . ’
Or you can say , ‘ Wow , this means I ’ll never have another friend in my life . ’
And the people who take it the second way are going to be at risk for depression . ”
These ways of thinking about the events in one ’s life are pretty stable in adults and even toward the end of adolescence , Gibb said .
He wants to know when children develop these thinking styles and find out whether negative experiences early in life contribute to that development .
His study will also look at how specific genes affect these outcomes .
“ We ’re looking at variation in genes that we think are related to heightened reactivity to environmental stress , ” Gibb said .
“ We ’re looking at whether we can identify sub - groups that are protected from or at greater risk of depression . ”
Collaborators on the project include geneticists John McGeary at Brown University and Andrew Smolen at the University of Colorado as well as Constance Hammen at UCLA and David Cole at Vanderbilt University .
“ There ’s no simple answer to depression , ” Gibb said .
“ People can get depressed for a lot of reasons .
What we ’re trying to do is take a lot of the reasons and see how they all work together to contribute to an enduring risk that is developed during childhood and maintained throughout someone ’s life . ”
Researchers will meet with the study participants , who will all be drawn from the Greater Binghamton community , every six months for two years .
The researchers will use interviews as well as questionnaires and computer - based tasks in the study .
“ We ’ll be able to develop a better understanding of the vicious cycle that depressed people find themselves in .
What often happens when people are depressed is they feel bad , so they withdraw from friends and family .
That makes them feel worse , so they withdraw more .
And they get caught in this cycle . ”
This is no small problem : Estimates suggest that , at any given point , 1 out of every 36 children and 1 out of 18 adolescents experiences major depression .
By age 18 , 1 in 7 has experienced at least one episode of major depression .
Many others have less - severe problems .
And children of depressed mothers have a risk three to four times higher than the general population .

Hammurabi was the first king of the Babylonian Empire , extending Babylon 's control over Mesopotamia by winning a series of wars against neighboring kingdoms .
Hammurabi is most remembered for his law code , including 282 laws regulating people ’s relationships in Mesopotamia .
Crime Under the Law Code of Hammurabi
The punishment for crime under the Hammurabi Law Code was severe , yet varied according to the social standing of the individual .
In fact , a crime against an upper class person was much more severe than the lower classes .
Punishment was meant to fit the crime , so the principle of “ an eye for an eye , tooth for a tooth ” was fundamental in this system .
Government officials were not free from the system , therefore if they failed to catch a burglar after lands were taken , they were expected to compensate for the loss .
Hammurabi Law Code 25 states
“ If a fire broke out in a house , and someone who comes to put it out cast his eye upon the property of the owner of the house , and take the property of the master of the house , he shall be thrown into that fire ” .
The same can be said for murderers if they were not apprehended .
Officials paid fines to the families of the murdered person if the guilty was n’t found .
On occasion , a soldier might hire a substitute to fight for them , however they were swiftly put to death , and the substitute was given their holdings .
Work Under the Hammurabi Law Code
The performance of work was highly regulated , especially in the case of builders .
If a house was constructed and collapsed , causing death of the owner , the builder was held accountable and put to death .
If the son or daughter of the owner was killed in the collapse , the son or daughter of the builder was put to death and all goods lost were replaced at the builder ’s expense .
Therefore , the use of consumer protection laws was a fundamental part of the system .
Commercial and Land Law According to Hammurabi
Source
There are several codes pertaining to land use and irrigation in the Hammurabi Law Code , indicating the importance and danger of declining crops if not utilized .
If irrigation systems were not kept in good condition and if they caused the loss of grain to another land owner , they were made to pay for the grain that was destroyed .
If they could n’t pay , they were sold into slavery and their goods sold .
Commercial loans were watched very closely , and in the event that a lender raised the interest rate , he would lose the entire amount of the loan .
Wages under the Hammurabi Code were also specified for bricklayers , laborers , and artisans .
Marriage and Family Under the Hammurabi Law Code
Marriage were arranged by the parents for their children .
All parties involved signed a contract because without it the couple was not considered legally married .
The husbands provided payment to the parents of the bride , in return receiving a dowry from the bride ’s family .
Women had very little rights in the marriage and failure to uphold their responsibilities were grounds for divorce .
If the wife was not able to bear children or left home to engage in business , her husband could divorce her and did not have to return the dowry .
In the case of divorce , if the man divorced the wife for no good reason , the wife could get the dowry back with just cause .
Consequently , if the husband died the wife inherited his lands and would decide which son would receive the inheritance .
Sexual Relations Under the Law Code of Hammurabi
Husbands were permitted to partake in sexual relations outside of marriage , but not wives .
A wife that committed adultery , with her lover , was thrown into the river .
If one party was pardoned , the other half had to be as well .
Incestuous relations between a daughter and her father would result in banishment .
Incest between a mother and her son resulted in both being burned .
Similar to many ancient societies , the father ruled the family and his wife with strict authority .
No offense was off limits or unpunishable , as the father would embrace the “ eye for an eye ” aspect of the fundamental system of the Hammurabi Law Code .

There are always heated debates when it comes to the number of immigrant workers in the UK .
This is particularly true in the IT industry , where thousands of workers enter the UK through the controversial Intra Company Transfer ( ICT ) scheme .
This often occurs when companies offshore IT work to low cost destinations , such as India .
Whether you think there have been too many non EU workers in the UK or whether you think they are an essential resource , below are the hard facts .
An Inside Outsourcing reader has sent me all the figures on labour immigration to the UK over the last 11 years .
This was provided in answer to a recent parliamentary question from James Clappison MPIt makes interesting reading and shows just how core to the immigration debate the IT industry is .
It also adds fuel to the fire when it comes to the debate over alleged abuses of ICTs .
If you click on the links below you can see all the statistics , as presented by the government , for the total number of immigrant workers by occupation , the total number using ICTs by occupation and the total number using ICTs by nationality .
These show all occupations but IT stands out as a major recipient of immigrant workers .

South Korean soldiers stand guard at a loudspeaker used for blaring propaganda toward North Korea near the demilitarized zone north of Seoul .
( ( Lee Sang - hak / Associated Press ) )
North Korea says it will sever all ties and communication with Seoul as retaliation for what it calls a " smear campaign " over the sinking of a South Korean warship .
North Korea 's official Korean Central News Agency quoted the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea as saying late Tuesday that Pyongyang would also expel all South Koreans working at a joint industrial park in the border town of Kaesong .
The announcement came after South Korea began a multi-pronged action against North Korea by sending propaganda broadcasts into the North for the first time in six years .
The South 's resumption of psychological warfare — including radio broadcasts and loudspeakers along the border blaring propaganda — were among measures the government announced Monday to punish Pyongyang for a March 26 torpedo strike that sank the warship Cheonan , killing 46 sailors .
Activists shout slogans as they burn a North Korean flag and a picture of North Korean leader Kim Jong - il during a rally in Seoul on Tuesday .

Trade slashed
The South is also slashing trade and denying permission to North Korean cargo ships to pass through South Korean waters .
A team of international investigators concluded last week that a torpedo from a North Korean submarine tore apart the Cheonan .
The sinking was the South 's worst military disaster since the 1950 - 53 Korean War , which ended with an armistice but no peace treaty .
The North denies involvement and has warned that retaliation would mean war .
It has threatened to destroy any propaganda facilities installed at the heavily militarized border .
On Tuesday , the North claimed dozens of South Korean naval ships violated the countries ' disputed western sea border earlier this month and threatened to take " practical " military measures in response .
South Korea 's military had no immediate response other than to say that North Korea routinely makes similar accusations .
North Korea is already subject to various UN - backed sanctions in response to its nuclear weapons and missile programs .
The latest steps announced by Seoul are seen as among the strongest it could take short of military action .
Canada cuts ties with North
Canada said Tuesday it has formally suspended diplomatic relations with North Korea over the sinking of the South Korean warship .
The move came a day after the government announced it would tighten restrictions on trade , investment and other relations with North Korea , and would suspend visits to Canada by high - level North Korean officials .
Canada has had limited diplomatic relations with the government of Kim Jong - il in Pyongyang , but those will now end .
A spokeswoman for Foreign Affairs Minister Lawrence Cannon said relations had included " advocacy " visits by Canadian officials to talk about North Korea 's nuclear activities .
Canada sent three navy experts to the multinational team that investigated the warship sinking , and concluded the vessel was sunk by a torpedo .
China factor
U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton on Tuesday stepped up pressure on China to back international action against North Korea , calling peace and security on the Korean Peninsula " a shared responsibility . "
U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton talks with Chinese President Hu Jintao at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on Tuesday .
( ( Saul Loeb / Assciated Press ) )
" Now we need to work together again to address the serious challenge posed by the sinking of the South Korean ship , " Clinton said after two days of talks with Chinese officials .
" No one is more concerned about peace and stability in this region as the Chinese , " she said .
" We know this is a shared responsibility and in the days ahead we will work with the international community and our Chinese colleagues to fashion an effective , appropriate response . "
Meanwhile , the U.S. is planning two major military exercises off the Korean Peninsula in a display of force intended " to deter future aggression " by North Korea , the White House said .
There are 28,500 American troops in South Korea .
South Korea wants to bring North Korea before the United Nations Security Council over the sinking .
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said Monday he expects the Security Council to act , but China — North Korea 's main ally and a veto - wielding member of the Security Council — has so far done little but urge calm on all sides .
Propaganda campaign
South Korea 's military resumed radio broadcasts late Monday airing Western music , news and comparisons between the South and North Korean political and economic situations .
The military also planned to launch leaflets by balloon and other methods to inform North Koreans about the ship sinking .
In coming weeks , South Korea also will install dozens of propaganda loudspeakers and towering electronic billboards along the heavily armed land border to send messages enticing North Korean soldiers to defect to the South .
The North warned Monday it would fire at any propaganda installations in the demilitarized zone .
On Tuesday , North Korean state media cited the powerful National Defence Commission as saying the North 's soldiers and reservists were bracing for a " sacred war " against South Korea .
The South Korean Defence Ministry and Joint Chiefs of Staff said they have not obtained any indications of unusual activity by North Korea 's military .
More than 27,000 abandoned oil and gas wells lurk in the hard rock beneath the Gulf of Mexico , an environmental minefield that has been ignored for decades .
No one Ã¢â‚¬â€  not industry , not government Ã¢â‚¬â€ is checking to see if they are leaking , an Associated Press investigation shows .
The oldest of these wells were abandoned in the late 1940s , raising the prospect that many deteriorating sealing jobs are already failing .
ADVERTISEMENT
The AP investigation uncovered particular concern with 3,500 of the neglected wells Ã¢â‚¬â€ those characterized in federal government records as “ temporarily abandoned . ”
Regulations for temporarily abandoned wells require oil companies to present plans to reuse or permanently plug such wells within a year , but the AP found that the rule is routinely circumvented , and that more than 1,000 wells have lingered in that unfinished condition for more than a decade .
About three - quarters of temporarily abandoned wells have been left in that status for more than a year , and many since the 1950s and 1960s Ã¢â‚¬â€ eveb though sealing procedures for temporary abandonment are not as stringent as those for permanent closures .
As a forceful reminder of the potential harm , the well beneath BP ’s Deepwater Horizon rig was being sealed with cement for temporary abandonment when it blew April 20 , leading to one of the worst environmental disasters in the nation ’s history .
BP alone has abandoned about 600 wells in the Gulf , according to government data .
There ’s ample reason for worry about all permanently and temporarily abandoned wells Ã¢â‚¬â€ history shows that at least on land , they often leak .
Wells are sealed underwater much as they are on land .
And wells on land and in water face similar risk of failure .
Plus , records reviewed by the AP show that some offshore wells have failed .
Experts say such wells can repressurize , much like a dormant volcano can awaken .
And years of exposure to sea water and underground pressure can cause cementing and piping to corrode and weaken .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ You can have changing geological conditions where a well could be repressurized , ” said Andy Radford , a petroleum engineer for the American Petroleum Institute trade group .
Whether a well is permanently or temporarily abandoned , improperly applied or aging cement can crack or shrink , independent petroleum engineers say .
“ It ages , just like it does on buildings and highways , ” said Roger Anderson , a Columbia University petroleum geophysicist who has conducted research on commercial wells .
Despite the likelihood of leaks large and small , though , abandoned wells are typically not inspected by industry or government .
ADVERTISEMENT
Oil company representatives insist that the seal on a correctly plugged offshore well will last virtually forever .
“ It ’s in everybody ’s interest to do it right , ” said Bill Mintz , a spokesman for Apache Corp. , which has at least 2,100 abandoned wells in the Gulf , according to government data .
ADVERTISEMENT
Officials at the U.S. Interior Department , which oversees the agency that regulates federal leases in the Gulf and elsewhere , did not answer repeated questions regarding why there are no inspections of abandoned wells .
State officials estimate that tens of thousands are badly sealed , either because they predate strict regulation or because the operating companies violated rules .
Texas alone has plugged more than 21,000 abandoned wells to control pollution , according to the state comptroller ’s office .
Offshore , but in state waters , California has resealed scores of its abandoned wells since the 1980s .
ADVERTISEMENT
In deeper federal waters , though Ã¢â‚¬â€ despite the similarities in how such wells are constructed and how sealing procedures can fail Ã¢â‚¬â€ the official policy is out - of - sight , out - of - mind .
The U.S. Minerals Management Service Ã¢â‚¬â€ the regulatory agency recently renamed the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management , Regulation and Enforcement Ã¢â‚¬â€ relies on rules that have few real teeth .
Once an oil company says it will permanently abandon a well , it has one year to complete the job .
MMS mandates that work plans be submitted and a report filed afterward .
Unlike California regulators , MMS does n’t typically inspect the job , instead relying on the paperwork .
The fact there are so many wells that have been classified for decades as temporarily abandoned suggests that paperwork can be shuffled at MMS without any real change beneath the water .
ADVERTISEMENT
With its weak system of enforcement , MMS imposed fines in a relative handful of cases : just $ 440,000 on seven companies from 2003 - 2007 for improper plug - and - abandonment work .
Companies permanently abandon wells when they are no longer useful .
Afterward , no one looks methodically for leaks , which ca n’t easily be detected from the surface anyway .
And no one in government or industry goes underwater to inspect , either .
Government regulators and industry officials say abandoned offshore wells are presumed to be properly plugged and are expected to last indefinitely without leaking .
Only when pressed do these officials acknowledge the possibility of leaks .
Despite warnings of leaks , government and industry officials have never bothered to assess the extent of the problem , according to an extensive AP review of records and regulations .

That means no one really knows how many abandoned wells are leaking Ã¢â‚¬â€  and how badly .
The AP documented an extensive history of warnings about environmental dangers related to abandoned wells :
_ The General Accountability Office , which investigates for Congress , warned as early as 1994 that leaks from offshore abandoned wells could cause an “ environmental disaster , ” killing fish , shellfish , mammals and plants .
In a lengthy report , GAO pressed for inspections of abandonment jobs , but nothing came of the recommendation .
_ A 2006 Environmental Protection Agency report took notice of the overall issue regarding wells on land : “ Historically , well abandonment and plugging have generally not been properly planned , designed and executed . ”
State officials say many leaks come from wells abandoned in recent decades , when rules supposedly dictated plugging procedures .
And repairs are so routine that terms have been coined to describe the work : “ replugging ” or the “ re-abandonment . ”
_ A GAO report in 1989 provided a foreboding prognosis about the health of the country ’s inland oil and gas wells .
The watchdog agency quoted EPA data estimating that up to 17 percent of the nation ’s wells on land had been improperly plugged .
If that percentage applies to offshore wells , there could be 4,600 badly plugged wells in the Gulf of Mexico alone .
ADVERTISEMENT
_ According to a 2001 study commissioned by MMS , agency officials were “ concerned that some abandoned oil wells in the Gulf may be leaking crude oil . ”
But nothing came of that warning either .
The study targeted a well 20 miles off Louisiana that had been reported leaking five years after it was plugged and abandoned .
The researchers tried unsuccessfully to use satellite radar images to locate the leak .
But John Amos , the geologist who wrote the study , told AP that MMS withheld critical information that could have helped verify if he had pinpointed the problem .
“ I kind of suspected that this was a project almost designed to fail , ” Amos said .
He said the agency refused to tell him “ how big and widespread a problem ” they were dealing with in the Gulf .
Amos is now director of SkyTruth , a nonprofit group that uses satellite imagery to detect environmental problems .
He still believes that technology could work on abandoned wells .
ADVERTISEMENT
MMS , though , has n’t followed up on the work .
And Interior Department spokeswoman Kendra Barkoff said agency inspectors would be present for permanent plugging jobs “ only when something unusual is expected . ”
She also said inspectors would check later “ only if there ’s a noted leak . ”
But she did not respond to requests for examples .
Companies may be tempted to skimp on sealing jobs , which are expensive and slow offshore .
It would cost the industry at least $ 3 billion to permanently plug the 10,500 now - active wells and the 3,500 temporarily abandoned ones in the Gulf , according to an AP analysis of MMS data .
The AP analysis indicates that more than half of the 50,000 wells ever drilled on federal leases beneath the Gulf have now been abandoned .
Some 23,500 are permanently sealed .
Another 12,500 wells are plugged on one branch while being allowed to remain active in a different branch .
Government records do not indicate how many temporarily abandoned wells have been returned to service over the years .
Federal rules require only an annual review of plans to reuse or permanently seal the 3,500 temporarily abandoned wells , but companies are using this provision to keep the wells in limbo indefinitely .
ADVERTISEMENT
Petroleum engineers say abandoned offshore wells can fail from faulty work , age and drilling - induced or natural changes below the seabed .
Maurice Dusseault , a geologist at the University of Waterloo in Ontario , Canada , says U.S. regulators “ assume that once a well is sealed , they ’re safe Ã¢â‚¬â€  but that ’s not always the case . ”
Even fully depleted wells can flow again because of fluid or gas injections to stimulate nearby wells or from pressure exerted by underlying aquifers .
Permanently abandoned wells are corked with cement plugs typically 100 - 200 feet long .
They are placed in targeted zones to block the flow of oil or gas .
Heavy drilling fluid is added .
Offshore , the piping is cut off 15 feet below the sea floor .
Wells are abandoned temporarily for a variety of reasons .
The company may be re-evaluating a well ’s potential or developing a plan to overcome a drilling problem or damage from a storm .
Some owners temporarily abandon wells to await a rise in oil prices .
ADVERTISEMENT
Since companies may put a temporarily abandoned well back into service , such holes typically will be sealed with fewer plugs , less testing and a metal cap to stop corrosion from sea water .
In the Deepwater Horizon blowout , investigators believe the cement may have failed , perhaps never correctly setting deep within the well .
Sometimes gas bubbles form as cement hardens , providing an unwanted path for oil or gas to burst through the well and reach the surface .
The other key part of an abandoned wells Ã¢â‚¬â€ the steel pipe liner known as casing Ã¢â‚¬â€ can also rust through over time .
MMS personnel do sometimes spot smaller oily patches on the Gulf during flyovers .
Operators are also supposed to report any oil sheens they encounter .
Typically , though , MMS learns of a leak only when someone spots it by chance .
In the end , the Coast Guard ’s Marine Safety Laboratory handles little more than 200 cases of oil pollution each year .
And manager Wayne Gronlund says it ’s often impossible to tell leaking wells from natural seeps , where untold thousands of barrels of oil and untold millions of cubic feet of gas escape annually through cracks that permeate the sea floor .
Actor Richard Dunn , best known for playing a bizarre Charlie Rose - like version of himself on the Adult Swim show Tim and Eric Awesome Show , Great Job ! has passed away , according to a tweet from Tim and Eric ‘s Tim Heidecker .
In recent years Dunn racked up numerous credits playing variations of the doddering old man type , with small parts in Parks and Recreation , Weeds , The Wedding Singer and the music video for P. Diddy ’s “ Bad Boy for Life . ”
In a 2007 interview with The Onion A.V. Club , Heidecker and Eric Wareheim described meeting Dunn :
EW : We were looking for Tim ’s dad for the first episode of Awesome Show ; we wanted it to be a much older guy , as if Tim hired some old guy to pretend to be his dad .

General who says “ It ’s fun to kill people ” picked to oversee US wars in Afghanistan , Iraq
12 July 2010
Last week , the Obama administration named Marine Corps Gen. James N. Mattis to replace Gen. David Petraeus as chief of US Central Command , giving the Marine officer overall command of US forces in Afghanistan and Iraq and across the Middle East and Central Asia .
The elevation of Mattis is further confirmation that last month ’s firing of Gen. Stanley McChrystal and appointment of Petraeus to take command of US and NATO forces in Afghanistan signaled a major escalation of US military violence against the Afghan people .
Mattis , also known , according to Wikipedia , as “ Chaos , ” “ Warrior Monk ” and “ Mad Dog Mattis , ” is notorious inside and outside of the military for his bloodlust and enthusiasm for killing .
He has a long record leading combat operations in US wars of aggression in the Middle East and Central Asia .
He served as a lieutenant colonel in Operation Desert Storm ( the US invasion of Iraq in 1991 ) , commanded the first ground troops that went into southern Afghanistan after the 2001 US invasion of that country , and led Marines in the 2003 invasion of Iraq .
In April of 2004 he headed up the first US assault on the Iraqi city of Fallujah and helped plan the siege later that year that destroyed the city and killed thousands of its residents .
In February of 2005 , at a public forum in San Diego , Mattis said that “ it ’s a hell of a lot of fun to shoot ” Afghans .
He continued : “ Actually , it ’s a lot of fun to fight .
You know , it ’s a hell of a hoot .
It ’s fun to shoot some people .
I ’ll be right upfront with you , I like brawling . ”
A bit later he spoke of the “ emotional … satisfaction you may get from really whacking somebody . ”
Mattis received an official rebuke for his comments .
They were , however , not an aberration .
In his 2006 book Fiasco : The American military Adventure in Iraq , Thomas Ricks writes that one of the rules the Marine commander gave his troops to live by was , “ Be polite , be professional , but have a plan to kill everybody you meet . ”
In a speech to Task Force Ripper during Desert Storm , he reportedly said , ‘ It ’s the mission of every Marine in the battalion to send one dead Iraqi home to Mama . ”
In announcing the appointment , Defense Secretary Robert Gates lauded Mattis as “ one of our military ’s outstanding combat leaders and strategic thinkers , bringing an essential mix of experience , judgment and perspective to this important post . ”
He shrugged off the official rebuke against Mattis , saying the incident was five years old .
Obama ’s elevation of this fascistic killer to the overall command of two major wars , covert and overt military operations in Yemen and Somalia , and the planning of new wars evoked no protest either from prominent Democrats , the major media , or supposedly “ left ” liberal organizations such as the Nation magazine .
On the other hand , it drew enthusiastic praise from the Wall Street Journal , which published an editorial Friday headlined “ An Obama Home Run . ”
The Journal declared that “ it is to Mr. Obama ’s credit that he has chosen to draw a line from Iran to Afghanistan with the one - two punch of Petraeus and Mattis . ”
It has not taken long to expose the gullibility of all those who hailed the sacking of McChrystal — ostensibly because of disparaging remarks about Obama and other civilian officials made by the general and his aides in a Rolling Stone article — as a powerful affirmation of civilian control over the military .
The World Socialist Web Site warned that the issue of civilian control was being used to give a democratic gloss to a decision to intensify the military slaughter in Afghanistan .
McChrystal had fallen out of favor because of his failure to suppress the growing popular insurgency against the US - led colonial occupation .
His position was fatally undermined in June when he acknowledged that last February ’s offensive against the town of Marjah in Helmand province had failed to dislodge the Taliban , and then postponed for several months the long - planned offensive against the Taliban stronghold of Kandahar .
Of particular concern in the military , the intelligence establishment and the Obama administration — as indicated by the Rolling Stone piece and articles in the New York Times and other newspapers — were McChrystal ’s rules of engagement , which somewhat restricted the use of American firepower against Afghan towns and villages in the name of limiting civilian casualties .
No sooner had Petraeus been nominated to replace McChrystal than the former commander of the US surge in Iraq announced that he would review the rules of engagement with an eye to enabling US troops to more freely kill and maim Afghan civilians .
Petraeus also made clear at his Senate confirmation hearing that the war would continue indefinitely , notwithstanding Obama ’s token “ drawdown ” date of July 2011 .
The entire political and media establishment immediately swung behind the shift in military tactics , as symbolized by the Senate ’s unanimous confirmation of Petreaus within days of his nomination .
Petraeus has yet to officially loosen the rules of engagement .
But in the week since he formally assumed command , a series of US and NATO massacres of Afghan civilians has occurred — although , it must be added , the US media has barely reported them .
On July 7 , US forces killed two civilians and arrested three others during a pre-dawn raid in the northern city of Mazar - i- Sharif .
Hundreds of residents protested Saturday , carrying banners reading , “ Death to America ! ”
NATO claimed that a commando raid in the eastern province of Paktia last week killed a Taliban operative and captured eight others .
Villagers protested outside of government offices Saturday , insisting that the men were innocent civilians .
On Wednesday , a NATO airstrike in Ghazni province in the east killed five Afghan soldiers and wounded two others .
The next day , NATO artillery shells killed six civilians and wounded several others in the Jani Khel district of Paktia province .
NATO officially admitted the massacre on Friday , issuing the usual perfunctory statement of regret .
At the same time , the killing and wounding of US and other NATO forces continues to escalate .
Last week , at least 14 American soldiers were killed , bringing to a total so far this month to a minimum of 23 .
June was the most deadly month for US and other occupation troops since the US invasion nearly nine years ago , with 102 killed , including 60 Americans .
In the face of growing popular support in Afghanistan for the entirely legitimate resistance against US colonial domination , a deteriorating military / security situation for the US and NATO in the country , and rising opposition to the war at home , the Obama administration has decided to step up the killing in an attempt to drown the resistance in blood .
This is a war crime .
It must be stopped by the development of a mass working class movement against imperialist war and the capitalist system that breeds it .

I know whenever I 've been really into a dude , the first thing I do when I get to a bar is immediately hit on the bartender , because as everyone knows , any woman who shows any signs of sexual interest whatsoever is a total whorebag who simply can't contain her whorishness and must flirt with every man on earth , no matter what .
Bonus points for using words like " yummy , " especially if you deliver them in a voice that sounds like a 4th grader who just figured out how to suck helium out of balloons at a birthday party .
Her Drink is Big , Frozen , and Blue She 's ready to party , which means meeting new people and having a good time , not getting naked with the first guy who buys her another round .
But sometimes it does mean getting naked with the first hot , cool guy who buys her another round .

That 's right , bro .
If she 's drinking a big , dumb - looking drink , it means she totally wants you .
Just you , and nobody else .
It could n't possibly be that she actually just wants , you know , a big blue frozen drink , because everyone knows that big blue frozen drink is code for " I 'd like the penis of the gentlemen in the corner , please , the one who reads Men 's Health and therefore has seen the sign which has opened up his eyes . "
I once forgot this rule when ordering a Blue Raspberry Icee at the movies and had to fight off 10 dudes with Men's Health subscriptions by flinging pieces of super pretzel at their faces and yelling , " I should have ordered cherry !
Symbolism ! SYMBOLISM ! "
Her Pupils are Dilated
If she 's feeling stimulated by you ( not just sexually ) , her pupils will dilate .
That 's because her body is programmed to want to see more of whatever 's exciting her , so her brain tells her irises to let in more light .
Time to make your move .
Either that or she 's just spent a half - hour at LensCrafters , you know ?
She 's a Chatterbox
If she leans forward when you 're talking or asks you endless questions , the only way to shut her up is to kiss her .

Ugh , women , am I right ?
Always talking and shit !
And when they lean in because they can't hear you when the music 's blaring , or when they like , ask you questions and shit ?
What a drag !
You better shut her up and kiss her , bro , or you 'll have to deal with like , the thoughts in her head and whatever bullshit she has to spew that does n't involve what a rad stud you are .
She 's Wearing Thigh - High Stockings
Women only wear sexy underthings when they 're expecting a man to see them .
If she 's wearing a thong , she 's trying to avoid panty lines , but sex is on her mind , too .
Anything black , red , pink , leopard print , or lace equals " I want you . "

Oh man .
Lesbians , did you know this ?
Do your girlfriends know ?
You should probably inform them that sexy underthings are only for the heteros , according to Men 's Health .
And ladies , unless you want to have sex , you should probably hit the club in your sweatpants and period underwear , preferably the blue ones with the print on them that reads , " No sex tonight , thanks , I 'm not wearing my ' asking for it ' clothes . "
Remember : you 're not allowed to wear anything for your own comfort or pleasure .
Only for the bros .
Why do you think Miss Havisham is constantly on the Maxim Hot 100 ?
Lace , ladies .
Lace .
Perhaps a better way to find out if a lady is truly interested is to , I do n't know , strike up a conversation with her , or at least attempt to , and see if she responds .
Her drink , her clothes , her ability to talk , her bartender flirting , her dialated pupils : none of these things are guarantees that she wants you in any way .
Some women may indeed be looking to hook up with a guy , but if you think her drink choice or her stockings are an open invitation to skeeze all over her , you are sorely mistaken .
Her underpants wo n't say " I want you , " she will .
But then again , you 're probably too busy trying to kiss her and shut up to actually hear what she 's saying .
Ladies !
They are the worst .

A few weeks ago I reported on “ americaspeakingout.com ” a new website created by the Republicans “ to increase the dialogue between Americans and their Congress ” .
Of course , the Republicans are n’t paying for the site themselves , they are using “ official funds of the Office of the House Minority Leader ” ( John Boehner ) .
According to the website :
Here , Americans are provided a new platform to share their priorities and ideas for a national policy agenda .
As House Republicans , we are committed to our principles of limited , more accountable government ; economic freedom ; lower taxes ; fiscal responsibility ; protecting life , American values , and the Constitution ; and providing for strong national security .
This is an open forum , however , where all Americans are welcome to respectfully offer their opinions , regardless of party affiliation and whether we endorse them or not .
It is our hope the active engagement of the American people will produce a robust debate that will aid in the construction of a new American agenda .
An open forum ?
At least one person is complaining that they were banned from the site , and saying that this is the comment that got them banned :
Not only is banning someone for a comment like this pretty hypocritically partisan and not very open , it makes you question if this site should be paid for by us taxpayers .
But the comment itself also eloquently points out one of the biggest hypocrisies of the Republican party .
While they pay lip service to social conservatives , Republicans get far too much benefit from continuing the culture wars , not only against abortion , but also against gay marriage , immigration , and many other issues .
Just this week , Indiana Governor Mitch Daniels got in hot water with social conservatives over his comments that the next president will have to call a truce in the culture war in order to focus on economic issues .
Presidential candidate Mike Huckabee blasted Daniels for the comment , but tellingly then used it to try to raise money for his campaign :
Help me raise 2,012 new donations within the next 7 days for Huck PAC .
That will help me show the importance of these issues to our Party and give us the financial resources we need to support strong conservatives who are fighting for life , traditional marriage , lower taxes , lower spending , secure borders and a strong national defense .
Help me send a strong signal – life and traditional marriage are NOT bargaining chips .
Make a donation today .
I guess Republicans have figured out what defense contractors have known for a long time : war , even a culture war , makes money .
Lots of money .
JULY 11 -- The Pennsylvania pizza delivery man who stuck up a bank and then was killed when a bomb attached to his neck exploded was a coconspirator in the bizarre 2003 scheme .
In an indictment unsealed today , Brian Wells is identified as a participant in the plot to rob a PNC Bank branch in Erie .
A copy of the indictment can be found below .
According to investigators , Wells and several other coconspirators hatched the robbery scheme , which involved Wells going into the bank with a homemade bomb locked around his neck .
Wells is pictured at right in a bank surveillance photo .
After he walked out with $ 8702 , Wells was apprehended by cops .
At that point , he claimed that the device was strapped on him by unknown gunmen who accosted him after he delivered pizzas to them .
While waiting for the bomb squad to arrive and examine the homemade device , it exploded , killing the 46 - year - old Wells .
The three - count indictment charges Marjorie Diehl Armstrong and Kenneth Barnes with bank robbery , conspiracy , and weapons possession .
Armstrong allegedly hatched the plot because she needed money to pay Barnes to kill her father .
While it does not appear her father was murdered , Armstrong was subsequently convicted of killing James Roden , her live - in boyfriend , ' to keep him from disclosing the bank robbery plan that was being formulated by the co-conspirators . '
A fifth plotter , William Rothstein , died in 2004 .
Roden and Rothstein are referred to by their initials in the indictment .

If you 're a public employee who uses a work - issued computer or mobile device , pay attention : the Supreme Court yesterday agreed ( PDF ) that government employers have the right to read transcripts of your e-mails or instant messages if needed for a legitimate work - related reason .
So if you 're a police officer sending huge volumes of sexually explicit text messages on a work device — as Jeff Quon allegedly was — the Fourth Amendment wo n't protect you from a government search .
The Quon v. Arch Wireless case began several years ago before finding its way to the Supremes .
Jeff Quon was a member of the city of Ontario , California SWAT team .
The city provides its officers with access to a wireless text messaging pager provided by Arch Wireless , which came with a monthly character limit .
Formally , the announced departmental policy was that the content of the messages sent could be audited at any time .
In practice , however , the pagers were handled quite differently .
The department never viewed their content , and simply asked users to pay any charges for running over the character limit .
Things proceeded uneventfully until the day when , as an early court decision phrases it , " Lieutenant Duke grew weary of his role as bill collector . "
The department decided to determine if the character limit was too low for departmental business , so it requested a copy of all messages on its account from Arch Wireless with the intent of determining whether business or personal use was driving the overage charges .
With the contents in hand , they discovered many of Quon 's messages were both personal and X - rated .
An internal investigation ensued , and Quon and the people he exchanged messages with sued the city , its police department , and Arch Wireless .
The Supreme Court ruled , though , that the search was reasonable " because it was motivated by a legitimate work - related purpose , and because it was not excessive in scope ...
Although Quon had exceeded his monthly allotment a number of times , [ Ontario Police Department ] requested transcripts for only August and September 2002 in order to obtain a large enough sample to decide the character limits ’ efficaciousness , and all the messages that Quon sent while off duty were redacted .
And from OPD ’s perspective , the fact that Quon likely had only a limited privacy expectation lessened the risk that the review would intrude on highly private details of Quon ’s life . "
The Court neglected to get into the broader issues of privacy raised by such devices , however .
" At present , it is uncertain how workplace norms , and the law ’s treatment of them , will evolve , " said the justices , who elected to decide the case on narrower grounds .
The EFF had filed a brief in the case , and was pleased that the Court did not issue sweeping privacy guidelines for electronic devices .
But the group did say it was time that Congress " stepped in to update and strengthen telephone and Internet privacy laws to reflect new technology . "
The case turned on the Fourth Amendment , which covers government searches ; private employers have long had broad rights to monitor employee communications .

Revolutionary new knee replacement could see patients walking just TWO HOURS after surgery
Revolutionary : Knee replacement surgery may no longer leave patients bedridden for days
Medics have come up with a new system of knee replacement that could see patients walking just two hours after surgery .
Most patients who undergo the new method are allowed to leave hospital within 36 hours and some are able to go home within a day of going under the knife .
Consultant orthopedic surgeon Tony Smith at North Wales NHS
Trust devised the system with a team of physiotherapists , anaesthetists , nurses and hospital managers .
They combined their ideas with the latest innovations from Australia , Copenhagen and the USA .
Instead of being laid up in bed for at least 24 hours , patients are encouraged to bend their legs to almost 90 degrees as soon as possible and to take their first new steps .
The concept is so alien to most patients that the team has had to set up a joint school to prepare them for what is in store .
The system combines new aesthetic techniques with highly effective pain management .
Anti-depressants and drugs traditionally used to treat fits are being employed , as medics have discovered they can act as pain killers .
Innovative : Tony Smith , who is leading the team of experts
About 2,000 patients will benefit from the improvements in the next 12 months alone .
The new techniques can also be used for hip and ankle treatments .
Mr Smith said : ‘ The fact is that many of these patients are better than those who are in hospital for six days or longer in other hospitals .
' We 're not pushing them out until they are ready . ’
Audrey Hughes , 71 , of Wrexham , speaking minutes after the surgery , said she was delighted with how things were going .
The level of success has also stunned nurses trialling the new system .
Senior ward nurse Anita Gittins , said : ‘ I 've worked here for 20 years and I can't believe how quickly they are recovering .
‘ Instead of getting caught up in managing bed rotas as patients slowly convalesce , they are getting down to treating the patients . '
Former Flintshire councillor Ron Evans , who had a double knee replacement using the old techniques , is acting as patient advisor .
He said : ' When I had my knee operations I was in for 11 days .
‘ What has been done here is amazing . ’
Programme manager Neil Windsor , who is now advising the Department of Health , said : ‘ We had the Health Minister Edwina Hart visit recently and we had a knee patient in the day before for her to meet but unfortunately for her he had left by the time she came round .
‘ He was out in 24 hours and that is not unusual . ’
Mr Smith added : ‘ What we 've had to achieve here is a culture change .
Now what we 're doing could be used across the board for elective surgery . ’

The pair played in a charity concert in Philadelphia
Former US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice joined veteran singer Aretha Franklin on stage to perform at a charitable gig on Tuesday .
Rice , who is a classically trained pianist , accompanied the soul legend during two of her hit songs at Philadelphia 's Mann Music Center .
She also played a selection of Mozart musical pieces .
The concert was held to raise money for urban children and awareness for music and the arts .
Rice , the Republican former aide to President George W Bush and Franklin - a committed Democrat who sang at President Barack Obama 's inauguration - met at a White House function .
Speaking to The Associated Press , Rice said : " We were just talking and chatting and she said ' You play , do n't you ? '
" And I said , ' Yes . '
And she said we should do something together . "
Franklin said she had been surprised at how talented Rice was .
" All I had seen of Dr Rice was in a political atmosphere .
It just seemed foreign that she would be a classical pianist .
" She really does play , she 's formidable . "
Rice played piano while Franklin sang I Say A Little Prayer and My Country ' Tis of Thee .

Kerr has been crowned Queen of the Victoria 's Secret angels after this stunning video ad for cotton lingerie .
The Australian beauty 's ad for Victoria 's Secret 's cotton lingerie line is getting record traffic on the net .
It 's been a hectic time for Kerr of late , getting engaged to Pirates ' star Orlando Bloom and dissing rumours she 's already pregnant .
She recently revealed she was genuinely shocked when Bloom , her boyfriend of four years , finally popped the question .
" We have been together for a while now and we had talked about it , but when it actually happened it was a total surprise . "
While she says one day she hopes to become a mother , the 27 - year - old brunette beauty has quashed rumours she is pregnant .
" The rumours started as soon as soon as it became known we were engaged .
We are ignoring them and enjoying this moment .
" I have always been very open about wanting to be a mother one day and I 've always thought Orlando would be a great dad . "

Hansen ’s twin pit bulls , Tamino and Gavin , have launched into a spirited defence of Mannian paleo - phrenology at realclimate here , with a counter - discussion at Bishop Hill here .
In the Muir Russell report , Richard Horton observed that orthodox medicine “ mostly rejects ” papers that invoke invisible pathways ( meridians of qi ) :
For example , the world of complementary and alternative medicine ( CAM ) divides the medical community .
Orthodox medicine mostly rejects papers about reflexology , iridology , and acupuncture treatment that invokes invisible pathways ( meridians ) of qi. CAM is served by a separate class of journals that have little overlap with the more mainstream medical literature .
In this instance , ideas are incommensurable .
Unfortunately , the climate science community has been far more accommodating to the paleoclimate equivalent of alternative statistics , into orthodox journals .
The wider climate science “ community ” is placed in the awkward position of trying to reassure the public that other parts of their field are , in fact , based on science , while , at the same time , not only not disavowing , but actively defending paleo - phrenologists and the meridians of qi converging on bristlecones in California and the magic larches in Yamal .
Given that strip bark bulges , which are mostly likely merely mechanical , are interpreted as expressions not just of local temperature and precipitation but of world “ instrumental training patterns ” or “ climate fields ” , phrenology is a surprisingly apt term .
The problems of strip bark standardization were being discussed in the thread where Climategate was first mentioned – a thread which contains relevant illustrations of the problems in trying to fit strip bark bulges into any statistical framework – let alone the statistical framework stated to underpin MBH98 .
The picture below shows the sort of phrenological bulge that underpins the strip bark Hockey Stick – see here for further discussion . )
There is convincing evidence that such bulges are present in strip bark chronologies – one of the reasons why the NAS panel said that they should be avoided in temperature reconstructions .
Gavin and Tamino can huff and puff all they want about the 4th principal component , but this is the sort of data that they are importing under the guise of the “ right ” number of principal components .
All their talk about the “ right ” number of principal components is simply sleight - of - hand to confuse you – when you watch the pea , the entire purpose of the high - falutin talk about principal components is to “ get ” strip bark bulges into the reconstruction .
This is an old debate , but the only thing that the Team moves is the pea under the thimble .
MBH98 stated :
Implicit in our approach are at least three fundamental assumptions .
( 1 ) The indicators in our multiproxy trainee network are linearly related to one or more of the instrumental training patterns .
In the relatively unlikely event that a proxy indicator represents a truly local climate phenomenon which is uncorrelated with larger scale climate variations , or represents a highly nonlinear response to climate variations , this assumption will not be satisfied .
This , of course , is a large part of the problem with strip bark bristlecones ( and YAD061 and its cousins . )
Actually , the problem with strip bark trees looks even worse – it seems very possible , even likely , that the 6 - sigma bulges in strip bark widths are purely mechanical , arising from the formation of strip bark itself .
However , these 6 - sigma bulges become proof in the hands of paleo - phreonologists using their own alternative statistics .
The failure of the most critical MBH proxies – strip - bark bristlecones – to meet the assumptions of their statistical model was stated as early as out 2004 Nature submission ( there is compelling evidence that Jones was the third and very antagonistic reviewer ) , where we stated :
The NOAMER PC1 thus gets its hockey stick shape from the Graybill - Idso sites , which exhibit a nonclimatic response and / or a nonlinear response to 20th century temperature .
Since MBH98 states ( p. 780 ) that their method requires the assumption that proxies exhibit a linear response to temperature , the Graybill - Idso sites , explicitly acknowledged as problematic in Mann et al ( 1999 ) ( ref. [ 13 ] ) , should have been disqualified as contributors to the NOAMER PC1 in MBH98 , let alone as the main determinants of its shape .
Much effort has been spent by paleo - phrenologists to frame the issue as the “ right ” number of principal components to retain – as opposed to the underlying issue as we had framed it – whether the assumptions of the underlying statistical model had been satisfied .
Indeed , we noted that MBH99 had even acknowledged the failure of stripbark bristlecones to satisfy the assumptions of their model :
Mann et al. ( 1999 ) themselves pointed out , with reference to these proxies : “ A number of the highest elevation chronologies in the western U.S. do appear , however , to have exhibited long - term growth increases that are more dramatic than can be explained by instrumental temperature trends in these regions . ”
With the inconsistency that so characterizes the field , after conceding that bristlecones do not meet the assumptions of their statistical model , Mann proceeded to use them anyway .
( Despite statements in MBH98 that the reconstruction was “ robust ” to the presence / absence of all dendro proxies , MBH98 was not “ robust ” to the presence / absence of bristlecones .
Thus , instead of not using bristlecones because they failed to satisfy the assumption of the statistical model , Mann purported to “ adjust ” the strip bark bristlecone chronologies – an adjustment convincingly criticized by Jean S last year .
Mann ’s methodology , here as elsewhere , belongs to what can only be described as alternative statistics , a discipline that , as noted above , has found a home in the climate science sections of otherwise orthodox journals .
Mann responded to our observation that Graybill strip bark bristlecones did not meet the fundamental assumption of his methodology by invoking a supposed relationship to “ instrumental training patterns ” as opposed to local temperature and precipitationi :
MM04 demonstrate their failure to understand our methods by claiming that we required that “ proxies follow a linear temperature response ” .
In fact we specified ( MBH98 ) that indicators should be “ linearly related to one or more of the instrumental training patterns2 ” , not local temperatures .
( Update - Jul 25 - 6 the criticism of Mannian teleconnections is not refuted by point to ENSO .
Individual trees respond to local temperature and precipitation etc ; they do not respond to abstractions like a PC3 .
Further , the problematic 6 - sigma strip bark bulges that characterize Team reconstructions are not a linear response to climate at all . )
Roman Mureika expresses the point in a comment as follows :
What the climate scientists do n’t seem to understand is that for teleconnections to be usable in a scientific fashion , there must be a specific real identifiable physical effect which operates at the proxy location .
This effect is clearly not local temperature since the proxy has not responded to that .
To further assume that this unidentified effect is related in an appropriate equivalent quantitative form to the proxy measurements is a fiction which lends itself to the cherry picking of spuriously correlated series .
[ end – update ]
In my opinion , if climate scientists in other parts of the community took pains to disavow paleoclimate meridians of qi and alternative statistical methods used to buttress them – which , after all , are an important part of the public face of climate science – there would have been less fall - out for the rest of the discipline in the wake of Climategate .
When the NAS panel said that strip bark bristlecones should not be used in temperature reconstructions , this should have put an end to the use of Graybill bristlecones in temperature reconstructions .
However , this did n’t happen .
Wahl and Ammann totally ignored the recommendations of the NAS panel , even though it was n’t finally published until a year after the NAS panel ; the companion paper , Ammann and Wahl 2007 , was n’t even submitted until after the NAS panel .
Other members of the Team also continued the use of strip bark after the NAS panel e.g.
Hegerl et al 2007 , Juckes et al 2007 , Mann et al 2008 .
Wahl and Ammann , as discussed in past CA posts , is a sustained exercise in Texas sharpshooting .
Their efforts to benchmark RE significance were , of course , a singular contribution to Texas sharpshooting literature .
But most of the rest of their article are variations on the theme .
Even the longstanding issue of 2 or 5 PCs comes down to Texas sharpshooting .
As Jean S reminded readers at Bishop Hill , there was no evidence that Mann used Preisendorfer ’s Rule N in determining the number of retained PCs in MBH98 .
Indeed , the explicit language of the article indicates another rule .
Mann has refused to provide source code evidencing the use of this rule in MBH98 .
Using this rule after the act is simply one more example of Texas sharpshooting – what Wegman called “ no statistical integrity ” .
Gavin Schmidt ’s inline responses to Judy Curry here relies heavily on Wahl and Ammann 2004 2005 2006 2007 includes a complaint that we have n’t published a rebuttal of Wahl and Ammann in the peer - reviewed litchurchur .
Obviously I ’ve commented on Wahl and Ammann at length at Climate Audit .
I recognize that these comments have n’t been peer reviewed by Jones , Santer , Mann and their associates , but they are still comments that I believe to be thoughtful and ones that are worth reading by someone interested in the topic .
There is a separate left - frame category for Wahl and Ammann .
Second , it is very much my belief that , if the points made in these threads and elsewhere are correct ( and I believe them to be ) , then these are sorts of things that specialists in the field , employed to do these sorts of studies , should be responsible for knowing whether or not I ’d written the threads .
That I ’ve commented should be an assistance to them , but surely not a prerequisite .
Third , although Schmidt complains that we have n’t rebutted Wahl and Ammann in the litchurchur , this is not entirely true .
McIntyre and McKitrick ( E&E 2005 ) rebutted many , if not most , of the points at issue in Wahl and Ammann .
This may seem a little surprising given that MM2005 ( EE ) was published prior to Wahl and Ammann .
Nonetheless , it is so .
All the key arguments of Wahl and Ammann 2007 – bristlecones in a lower - order PC4 , two versus 5 PCs , Mannian inverse regression without PCs – were first put forward in the Mann response to our re-submission , which I ’ve placed online here – see , in particular , Mann ’s cover letter .
These arguments from Mann ’s 2004 response to our Nature submission featured prominently in multiple threads in the opening of realclimate .
( It was these pre-emptive attacks on us that led to the opening of climateaudit as a blog in late January 2005 , thanks to the suggestion and initiative of John A. )
Although Wahl and Ammann did not cite either the Mann submission to Nature or the realclimate posts ( and conspicuously do not even acknowledge Mann ) , virtually all the main arguments in Wahl and Ammann derive from these prior publications by Mann .
Is n’t the failure to acknowledge such priority a form of plagiarism ?
In MM2005 ( EE ) , we reported on our examination of the various permutations and combinations of correlation and covariance PCs , the impact of 2 or 5 PCs , etc , that had been previously raised , plus a few others .
If you go through the salient cases of Wahl and Ammann , you ’ll find that they are already considered in MM2005 ( EE ) .
Of course , this is n’t reported either .
( Wahl ’s awareness of this priority is demonstrated in his Climategate correspondence with Briffa . )
Doubtless it would have made things easier for people if we ’d responded to Wahl and Ammann / Ammann and Wahl ( the SI to which only became available in summer 2008 ) and it ’s on my list of things to do .
But the fact that I have n’t attempted to run the gauntlet of Team reviewers in the litchurchur does n’t mean that I have n’t responded to Wahl and Ammann .
The points have been responded to at considerable length .
Schmidt also grasped the verification r2 nettle – a nettle that he would have been better off leaving ungrasped .
This was a battleground issue in 2005 .
Judy Curry had written :
just because no single significance test is objectively the best in all circumstances does not mean that you can cherry pick significance tests until you find one you like and ignore R2 .
Gavin Schmidt replied :
[ Response : This is simply insulting .
You have absolutely no evidence that this was the case .
The RE / CE statistics are perfectly fine at describing what the authors thought were relevant and have a long history in that field ( Fritts , 1976 ) and as we have seen the PCA issue is moot .
The idea that people went looking for ‘ bad statistics ’ to fix their results is without merit whatsoever .
Please withdraw that claim . ]
Well , it may be insulting , but the evidence is what it is .
Fritts , 1976 does not stand as an authority for not using verification r2 , as it is a test that Fritts recommends prior to doing the RE test .
Secondly , Schmidt ’s claim that Mann reported an RE / CE pair is untrue .
Mann did not report CE results for MBH98 .
They were first reported in MM2005 ( GRL ) , where we observed that the AD1400 step failed the CE test , as it had the verification r2 test .
However , the most compelling evidence of Mann reporting a verification r2 in a step where it was favorable was , of course , in MBH98 itself , where Figure 3b is clearly labeled “ verification r2 ” – see below :
Figure 1 . Excerpt from MBH98 .
While the verification r2 is illustrated geographically in the above graphic , and MBH98 stated that they considered r2 statistics , the SI to MBH98 showed only the RE results and not verification r2 statistics .
Mann ’s source code , archived in response to the House committee , showed that he calculated verification r2 in the same step as verification RE , a point made at the time and later presented to the NAS panel .
The original Wahl and Ammann submission likewise did not include verification r2 results ( even though they had issued a press release that our results were “ unfounded ” )
Our codes and the Wahl - Ammann code reconciled – Wegman waggishly observed that it was more correct to say that Wahl and Ammann replicated our results , than Mann’s .
As a reviewer of Wahl and Ammann , I asked that they include verification r2 results .
They refused , citing their GRL article as authority ( without disclosing to Schneider that their GRL article had already been rejected . )
In December 2005 , I suggested to Ammann that we write a joint paper clearly summarizing points of agreement and disagreement .
He refused , saying that it would be “ bad for his career ” .
This has led to a great deal of wasted time on everybody ’s part .
Again , he refused to report verification r2 results .
These were reported only after an academic misconduct complaint was filed against Ammann .
Needless to say , Ammann got the same negligible verification r2 results that we had .
The NAS offered to examine the verification r2 issue , but Cicerone removed it from the terms of reference of the NAS panel .
Nonetheless , panelist Christy asked Mann whether he had calculated verification r2 for the 1400 step and what the result was .
Mann denied calculating the verification r2 , saying that this would be a “ foolish and incorrect ” thing to do .
Of course , it was known at the time that he had calculated verification r2 statistics , since it was in his code and illustrated for the AD1820 step .
The “ dirty laundry ” email ( in which Mann sent to Briffa and Osborn the residuals that he later refused to send me ) had not been available to the NAS panel .
With these residuals in hand ( or even if the actual reconstruction steps had been made available ) , it was child ’s play to see the failed verification r2 , CE and other results .
As it was , the NAS panel was seemingly dumbfounded by Mann ’s bald - faced answer and did not follow up .
There was supposed to be an opportunity for public discussion after presentations .
However , Mann fled the room before anyone from the public e.g. me had an opportunity to ask .
I sharply criticized the NAS panel for sitting like bumps on a log and not following up .
Nychka came up to me afterwards and said that , just because they did n’t say anything did n’t mean that they did n’t notice .
They did n’t say anything in their report either on the topic so they might as well not have noticed .
The Wahl and Ammann attempt to justify the failed verification r2 test was itself one more instance of the Texas sharpshooting .
Once the failed verification r2 was exposed ( and only after its exposure by third parties ) , they attempted to re-frame the question by now arguing that verification r2 was n’t a relevant statistic – notwithstanding their use of the statistic in the illustration when it was to their advantage .
Schmidt may find this impolite , but facts are sometimes stubborn .
The failure of the MBH verification r2 results was not as small a result at the time as now portrayed by the Team .
Eduardo Zorita told me that his view on MBH changed once he knew of the failed verification r2 .
If Mann wanted to argue that the failed verification r2 did n’t “ matter ” , the failed results should have been reported and discussed in the original article .
Thus , while reconstructions relying on strip bark bulges of California bristlecones and magic Yamal larches have been published in orthodox scientific journals , this does not change the fact that the underlying analyses do not rise above phrenology .

Mal waren es 6 , mal 10 und mal 18 Euro .
Einmal erbeuteten sie 300 Euro .
Dazu haben sie den Händlern einzelne Schachteln Zigaretten abgenommen und Monatskarten .
Jetzt müssen Udo R. und Michael R. für vier Jahre und neun Monate beziehungsweise drei Jahre und neun Monate hinter Gitter .
Das Landgericht Berlin hat sie am Dienstag wegen bewaffneten Raubes verurteilt .
Das Besondere : Die beiden Verurteilten waren Bundespolizisten .
Sie raubten in Uniform , mit Dienstwaffe , Schlagstock und Handschellen .
Allein für bewaffneten Raub sieht das Gesetz eine Mindeststrafe von drei Jahren Haft vor .
Hinzu kamen in diesem Prozess Körperverletzung im Amt , Freiheitsberaubung und Sachbeschädigung .
Die Polizisten hatten von illegalen Zigarettenhändlern verlangt , dass sie sich bei den Kontrollen mitten im Winter die Unterhosen herunter - und die Socken ausziehen .
Einmal ließen sie sie Schnee schippen .
Die Beamten zerstörten SIM - Karten der Handys ihrer Opfer , damit diese keine Hilfe holen konnten .
In Einzelfällen wurden Vietnamesen mit der Faust und dem Schlagstock geschlagen oder mitten in der klirrenden Kälte außerhalb der Stadt in einer ihnen unbekannten und menschenleeren Gegend ausgesetzt .
Das traf auch einen Vietnamesen , der bei mehr als 10 Grad unter null nur Latschen getragen hatte , weil er nur vor die Tür seines Wohnheims gegangen war .
" Ich habe beim Lesen der Anklageschrift gedacht , ich lese nicht richtig " , sagte Richter Matthias Schertz .
Die Bundespolizisten verdienten netto 2.400 beziehungsweise 1.800 Euro .
Sie hatten einen sicheren Arbeitsplatz und Pensionsansprüche .
Beide waren in geordneten Verhältnissen aufgewachsen und in ihrem Leben nie straffällig geworden .
" Um Geld ging es gar nicht , darin sind sich alle Prozessbeteiligten einig " , sagte der Richter in seiner Urteilsbegründung .
" Ihnen ging es darum , Macht auszuüben .
In Vietnamesen hätten sie ihre Opfer erblickt , weil " ihnen in den Augen der Angeklagten sowieso keiner glauben würde " .
Das war ein Irrtum .
Die Opfer trauten sich der Leitung ihres Asylheims an .
Die stellte Strafanzeige .
Die Polizisten waren voll geständig und räumten insgesamt acht Fälle ein - zwei mehr als angezeigt .
Vor Gericht entschuldigten sie sich bei ihren Opfern .
Ihre Reuebekundungen klangen glaubhaft .
Udo R. und Michael A. hatten nach eigenen Angaben aus Frust gehandelt .
" Ich wollte Gutes tun , aber nur selten gab es gute und sinnvolle Einsätze " , hatte Udo R. ausgesagt .
Er hatte mehrfach Versetzungsanträge gestellt und sich auf Stellen beworben - vergebens .
Die Polizisten versahen ihren Dienst auf vergleichsweise ruhigen S - Bahnhöfen wie Baumschulenweg und Treptower Park .
Dort erteilten sie Fahrgästen Auskünfte und kontrollierten vietnamesische Zigarettenhändler .
Erfolgserlebnisse blieben aus .
" Man schrieb gegen Zigarettenhändler eine Anzeige , und eine oder zwei Stunden später stand der Betroffene wieder am alten Platz " , führte Udo R. aus .
Das Gesetz sieht beim illegalen Zigarettenhandel Geldstrafen vor .
Das aber schreckt Vietnamesen nicht ab , die sich hoch verschuldet haben , um illegal nach Europa gebracht zu werden .
Da haben die beiden Polizisten das Recht in die eigene Hand genommen und Exekutive und Judikative verwechselt .
Beide Männer sitzen seit Februar in Untersuchungshaft und sind aus dem Staatsdienst ausgeschieden .
" Wir dulden solches Polizeihandeln nicht und haben die Ermittlungen aktiv unterstützt " , sagte Jörg Kunzendorf vom Bundesinnenministerium .
She now sells enclosures in dozens of shapes and sizes , some with fanciful names like the Penthouse ( with three tiers of hammocks ) and the Ferris Wheel ( it looks like one ) .
Kittywalk also sells strollers for cats and dogs .
And as a support - the - troops gesture , the Kings have sent cat enclosures to American military bases in Iraq and Afghanistan .
“ The thing that gives me the most gratification is that cats like my products , ” Mrs. King said .
Even indoors , a cat enclosure can be a boon , said Carole C. Wilbourn , a cat therapist in Manhattan who recommends them to clients struggling with what she calls “ inter - cat hostility . ”
“ I have cases where someone is introducing another cat , and they have a studio apartment , ” Ms. Wilbourn said .
“ It ’s kind of hard for them to put up a barrier ” for the cats to get used to each other without fighting , she said .
An enclosure keeps the cats separate — but within eye range — until they get along .
VETERINARIANS
disagree over whether it is depressing for cats to spend their lives indoors .
Some , like Drew Weigner , a cat specialist in Atlanta , believe that outdoor space offers cats emotional benefits .
While it is safer for them to stay inside , “ in an enclosed yard , they ’re going to get more exercise , ” Dr. Weigner said .
“ Plus , there ’s the intellectual stimulation , quote - unquote . ”
Dr. Weigner advises suburban cat owners to keep outdoor enclosures off the ground , to guard against fleas and other parasites .
He pointed to the American Association of Feline Practitioners ’
Web page on environmental enrichment , which recommends several types of fencing for suburban cats .
Arnold Plotnick , a veterinarian who owns the Manhattan Cat Specialists practice on the Upper West Side , agrees that stimulation is good , but does not think that cats need to go outside .
“ Cats are really fine being indoors their entire lives , ” he said .
“ That ’s why they ’re the perfect New York City pet . ”
But he warns about high - rise syndrome , in which cats leap or fall out of unsecured windows .
For cat owners in the city , there are a few off - the - shelf options .
On the low end of the market are collapsible , stand - alone enclosures that can be used on a terrace or deck ( or indoors ) and cost as little as $ 40 .
For people with small yards , there are room - size enclosures — typically with a few shelves where cats can sleep or look around — that can be bought or built for $ 125 to $ 500 .
Image caption The White House says the records refer to a period before the current US strategy came into effect
More than 90,000 leaked US military records have been published on the website Wikileaks , reportedly revealing hidden details of the Afghanistan war .
Three major news publications which have been shown the documents say they include unreported killings of Afghan civilians .
The huge cache of classified papers is described as one of the biggest leaks in US military history .
The White House has condemned the leaks as " irresponsible " .
Reports by the UK daily The Guardian , the New York Times and the German weekly Der Spiegel say the leaked papers reveal Nato concerns that neighbouring Pakistan and Iran are helping Taliban insurgents in Afghanistan .
The Pakistani ambassador in Washington said the " unprocessed " reports did " not reflect the current onground realities " .
" The United States , Afghanistan and Pakistan are strategic partners and are jointly endeavouring to defeat al - Qaeda and its Taliban allies militarily and politically , " said Husain Haqqani .
The reports also suggest :
The Taliban has had access to portable heat - seeking missiles to shoot at aircraft .
A secret US unit of army and navy special forces has been engaged on missions to " capture or kill " top insurgents .
Many civilian casualties have gone unreported , both as a result of Taliban roadside bombs and Nato missions that went wrong .
The BBC 's diplomatic correspondent Bridget Kendall says that although the documents reveal no dramatic new insights , they show the difficulties of the war and the civilian death toll .
The reports offer an unvarnished and grim picture of the Afghan war , she adds .
In a statement , US National Security Adviser Gen James Jones said such classified information " could put the lives of Americans and our partners at risk , and threaten our national security " .
He said the documents covered the period from 2004 to 2009 , before President Obama " announced a new strategy with a substantial increase in resources for Afghanistan " .
' Civilian deaths '
Another US official said that Wikileaks - which specialises in making public untraceable material from " whistleblowers " - was not an objective news outlet and described it as an organisation that opposes US policy in Afghanistan .
Broadly speaking the leaks are unwarranted and uncalled for .
But it lends the ongoing war a semblance of transparency Aziz Merchant on BBC Have Your Say Send your comments
But the head of the Foreign Relations Committee in the US Senate said that " however illegally these documents came to light , they raise serious questions about the reality of America 's policy toward Pakistan and Afghanistan " .
" Those policies are at a critical stage and these documents may very well underscore the stakes and make the calibrations needed to get the policy right more urgent , " said Democrat Senator John Kerry .
Wikileaks is releasing the set of documents under the title Afghan War Diary .
It says is has delayed the release of about 15,000 reports from the archive as part of a " harm minimisation process demanded by our source " .
The Guardian and the New York Times say they had no contact with the original source of the leak , but spent weeks crosschecking the information .
The reports come as Nato says it is investigating reports that as many as 45 civilians died in an air strike in Helmand province on Friday .
Although an initial Nato investigation found no evidence , a BBC journalist visiting Regey village spoke to several people who said they had witnessed the incident .
They said the attack had come in daylight as dozens sheltered from fighting in nearby Joshani .
A Nato spokesman said international forces went to great lengths to avoid civilian casualties .
" The safety of the Afghan people is very important to the International Security Assistance Forces , " Lt Col Chris Hughes added .
From the pollsters at PPP , discussing their latest Ohio polling :
52 % of the undecideds in the Senate race disapprove of President Obama to 35 % who like the job he 's doing .
They do n't think much of the Democrats in Congress either - only 26 % have a like the job they 're doing .
Those numbers might seem bad - but they pale in comparison to how negatively those voters feel about Congressional Republicans - only 10 % approve of the job they 're doing while 61 % disapprove .
So these voters are down on President Obama and the Democratic majority - but their most negatives feelings are toward the Republican minority .
These are folks who normally would vote to ' throw the bums out . '
But they think the alternative is even bigger bums .
It 'll be interesting to see how folks like this across the country end up voting this fall - and it could determine whether Democrats keep control of the House and a healthy majority in the Senate or not .
By all rights , Democrats should get crushed in November .
They took office promising change , and their actions have been , at best , weak tea .
Hostile corporatist interests have successfully watered down every bit of legislation passed .
The job picture is dismal , with zero apparent urgency in DC to do something about it .
Democrats have actually convinced themselves that voters care more about deficits than they do about job creation .
We 're still myred in unwinnable wars .
And remember , this was all with super majorities in both chambers of Congress .
So yeah , there 's plenty of motivation to punish Democrats for their ineffectiveness and timidity in the face of dramatic challenges .
But Republicans , as effective as they 've been in blocking much of the change Democrats could 've delivered , have utterly failed in presenting an alternative .
And in that vacuum , voters can only assume the GOP agenda is exactly what they delivered in the eight years of the Bush Administration .
So one party is hated , the other one is seen as ineffective .
What 's a voter to do ?
We 'll see , but it 's clear as this cycle has shaped up , that the biggest impediment to massive Republican gains this November is the GOP itself .

Former World Wrestling Entertainment star Dave Batista started a two - day training stint with the Cesar Gracie camp Wednesday after Strikeforce helped facilitate the connection with the potential signee and the noted California gym .
Gracie told Sherdog.com that Batista arrived this afternoon and worked out with former Strikeforce middleweight champion Jake Shields and rolled with welterweight champion Nick Diaz at the Cesar Gracie gym in Lodi , Calif .
Gracie said that his initial read of the 41 - year - old pro wrestler was that he is a “ natural athlete .
”
“ He ’s got a lot to learn but his strength alone is impressive , ” Gracie told Sherdog.com Wednesday evening .
“ Obviously he ’s a beginner at jiu - jitsu but we can take a guy like that that ’s already a strong athlete like that and teach him what to not get caught in .
” Gracie said Batista , who grew up in Washington D.C. , wrestled in high school and has some background in traditional martial arts standup fighting .
“ He ’s a pretty good kicker , ” said Gracie .
“ He hits very hard . ” Gracie said he , Batista , training partner Imani Lee and Strikeforce matchmaker Rich Chou were to meet Wednesday evening to discuss a game plan to get Batista ready for a pro MMA fight .
Strikeforce is negotiating with the multi-time Wrestlemania headliner to try his hand in MMA .
A long - time fan of the sport , who has reportedly trained at the Affliction training facility in Los Angeles , Batista began talks with Strikeforce last month after ending a lucrative eight - year run with the WWE .
Batista said in interviews that he had become disillusioned with the industry and has recently pursued film acting .
“ I did discuss it with him and he told me he was definitely interested in doing an MMA fight , so that ’s the game plan and I think what we ’re going to discuss is a training schedule and some serious hardcore training , ” said Gracie .
“ I think they realized when they were training with my guys today , they were amazed .
” Gracie said the connection started with Lee , who fought on the same Dream 14 card as Nick Diaz in May .
“ Nick and Imani , they started working , talking and working technique and then Imani expressed his desire to come up , ” Gracie said .
Batista and Lee tried to contact Diaz for several days after the event , Gracie said , but were unsuccessful .
They went to Strikeforce for help reaching Gracie , and the promotion facilitated the connection .
Strikeforce CEO
Scott Coker has said he would be interested to see Batista tested in the MMA cage , and is particularly interested in matching him with another WWE alumnus in Bobby Lashley Gracie said he can see where promoters would be interested in Batista because he is “ very charismatic , very self confident . . . definitely a presence .
” Asked when he thinks Batista would be ready for a pro fight , Gracie said it would depend on who his opponent is .
“ You ’re talking about a guy who is very powerful , very strong and an extremely hard worker , and if he can put it all together he could be a very formidable force , ” he said .
“ And he ’s at the right camp for that …
Our camp is known for bringing people with nothing and making them into something .
We like to make champs . ”
A public option -- and an employer mandate -- are working in San Francisco
People do n't talk much about the health - care reforms San Francisco put into place in 2006 , but Carrie Hoverman Colla , William H. Dow and Arindrajit Dube have looked into the early evidence , and it 's encouraging :
In 2006 San Francisco adopted major health reform , becoming the first city to implement a pay - or - play employer health spending mandate .
It also created Healthy San Francisco , a “ public option ” to promote affordable universal access to care .
Using the 2008 Bay Area Employer Health Benefits Survey , we find that most employers ( 75 % ) had to increase health spending to comply with the law , yet most ( 64 % ) are supportive of the law .
There is substantial employer demand for the public option , with 21 % of firms using Healthy San Francisco for at least some employees , yet there is little evidence of firms dropping existing insurance offerings in the first year after implementation .
I guess in San Francisco , even the private businesses are run by socialists .
There is outrage amongst sections of the online community as it is revealed that at the behest of copyright holders , a free online library has been raided by police .
Chitanka carried user translated and submitted books , poems and other literature and as an " altruistic library " was thought to be legal under current legislation .
Instead the site was raided and subjected to criminal procedures .
Following complaints from a book association , various publishers and translators , the Bulgarian government has dismantled a popular literary resource in Bulgaria .
Chitanka .info was an online library that indexed both local and translated user - scanned and edited books , poetry and other literature .
In addition to official titles , many works were uploaded by their creators .
The site was a free resource and carried no advertising .
A few days ago the Bulgarian Ministry of Internal Affairs ( MVR ) announced that an operation had been carried out against Chitanka by the Unit for Combating Organized Crime ( GDBOP ) .
The unit had been following up on complaints from the Bulgarian Book Association , Bulgarian Translators Alliance and various publishing houses .
According to the government , the site was run by “ a six person criminal group ” with a “ strict hierarchy ” located in various cities around the country and the site ’s server had been found hidden in the roof of a public building in Sofia .
They also claimed that the “ gang ” added around 600 books , dictionaries , textbooks and other literary works every month .
The police said that the free spreading of these works was damaging to Bulgarian culture and cost book publishing businesses millions of euros .
TorrentFreak spoke with individuals close to the site who disputed the tone and terminology used in the government statements .
“ First , there was no such thing as an ‘ six - person criminal group ’ , ” one explained .
“ The registration of ‘ uploaders ’ on the site was free , and everyone could upload a book there ( and I have also uploaded 2 - 3 short stories ) .
Yes , it is true that there were some people who did n’t [ provide ]
OCR - ed material , but only edited , OCR - ed books by others , but I ca n’t say in any way that this is a ‘ strict hierarchy ’ . ”
Also the claim that 600 works were uploaded every month appears to be an exaggeration .
Although 625 were uploaded in January , subsequent months saw 144 , 112 , 260 and 280 uploaded .
The claim that the virtual library was damaging to Bulgarian culture was also contested .
“ I ca n’t understand how any library can damage the the culture of any nation .
And , as there are virtually no e-readers sold here , the only way to read the downloaded books , was on the monitors of PCs , ” a Chitanka user told us .
“ Anybody that has ever read a book on a screen knows that it is n’t very comfortable .
So , lots of paper books have been bought , because when someone starts reading on the screen , likes the book , but is not comfortable , he goes to the book shop and buys it . ”
Aside from complying with any takedown requests ( we are informed that the site took down any books associated with complaints ) , there is a fairly detailed post to be found here which suggests that under current Bulgarian law , as an “ altruistic library ” Chitanka is perfectly legal .
A little later the main Chitanka .
info domain was reinstated and now carries information about the ongoing situation which indicates that the owner of the site is bemused at the route taken by the authorities .
Rather than pursue the civil route against the site , the authorities have immediately chosen to treat the case as criminal which gives them greater powers to easily shut down the site even before any legal process has deemed it illegal .
“ In that way , the lawsuit will not matter , ” said the site ’s owner in a statement .
“ The devastation is done . ”
In an interesting twist , in April this year Yavor Kolev , the chief of Bulgaria ’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property unit , was given the “ Knight of the Book ” award by none other than the Bulgarian Book Association , the group which made the complaints about Chitanka to the authorities .
But , as usual , the Internet community has reacted to the perceived injustices in the best way they know how – by copying .
A torrent has appeared on The Pirate Bay titled “ Static version of chitanka.info as of 2010 - 05 - 24 ” which contains all of the material previously carried by Chitanka .
This archive was put to good use .
After first buying the domain GDBOP.com ( unfortunately the organized crime unit did n’t think to reserve it first ) an unknown individual used the downloaded archive to reinstate the site .
The archive has been spreading round quite quickly and is now accessible from several other domains .
“ The site will resume its normal operations , except that it will be stronger and bigger than before , ” a source close to the site operators told TorrentFreak .
“ There are plans for cooperations with authors and translators for e-book publishing . ”
Der Vorteil , wenn man einen Kommentar schreibt ist , dass man seine persönliche Meinung schreibt .
Der Nachteil ist , dass man trotzdem , je nach Medium mehr oder weniger , die Fassung bewahren muss .
Was in Sachen CDU / CSU derzeit nahezu unmöglich ist .
Aktuell wird in Deutschland viel über den Fall Ramelow diskutiert :
Als Vertreter und Funktionär der Partei Die Linke ( PDL ) wird er vom Verfassungsschutz beobachtet .
Wenn man der Presse das richtig entnimmt allerdings nicht so direkt , vielmehr sei es wohl so , dass sein Wirken in der Öffentlichkeit dokumentiert wird .
Das der Verfassungsschutz das nach wie vor darf , betitelt Die Zeit in einem Kommentar mit der Headline :
“ Ein gutes Urteil gegen die Linke ”
Ich finde das beunruhigend , denn die PDL ist nicht verboten und es sind auch keine Verbotsverfahren anhängig .
Und schon von daher kann gefragt werden , mit welchen Maßstäben denn eine Partei beobachtenswert ist .
Und das bringt mich zur CDU / CSU .
Obwohl man über die derzeit implodierende CDU vielleicht gar nichts mehr sagen sollte , so viele noch nicht zurückgetretene hat es ja nicht mehr .
Dennoch : Die CDU / CSU bereitet mir Sorge .
Einfach weil in immer kürzeren Abständen immer abstrusere Forderungen und Aussagen von ihr zu vernehmen sind , die bei Gott kein Einzelfall mehr sein wollen .
Und schon von daher sollte man die Frage stellen , welchen Schaden die CDU / CSU unserer Demokratie zufügt und ob sie nicht besser beobachtet werden sollte ?
So kann man zum Beispiel jüngst auf Queer .de lesen :
Der sächsische CDU - Politiker Kai Hähner hat in einer E - Mail dem CSD Leipzig vorgeworfen , Werbung für Homosexualität zu machen und damit Kinder vom rechten Weg abzubringen – er droht mit einer Klage .
Hähner , der einen CDU - Ortsverband in Chemnitz leitet und Bezirksvorsitzender der parteieigenen “ Ost - und Mitteldeutschen Vereinigung ” für Vertriebene und Aussiedler ist , kritisierte die CSD - Organisatoren für ihre Öffentlichkeitsarbeit : “ Leben Sie , wie Sie wollen , im Privaten und lassen Sie andere mit Ihrer Abnormalität in Ruhe ” , schrieb der sächsische Christdemokrat .
Grund der Aufregung ist ein Interview eines Organisatoren im Radiosender MDR Info : “ Durch Ihre öffentlichen Auftritte und das Zuschaustellen Ihrer Lebensweise gilt Homosexualität inzwischen als ´trendy´ .
Und somit verleiten Sie Jugendliche , die sich in einer sexuellen Findungsphase befinden . ”
Das passt ja fast perfekt zu Frau Merk , die in ihrer Funktion als Justizministern ( CSU ) von Bayern folgendes in der Augsburger Allgemeinen zu sagen wußte :
Zugleich stellte sich die CSU - Politikerin hinter Mixas umstrittene
These , wonach die sexuelle Revolution « sicher nicht unschuldig » am Missbrauch von Kindern durch pädophile Priester sei .
« Selbstverständlich hat die Freizügigkeit dazu beigetragen , die Hemmschwelle zu senken » , sagte die CSU - Vizechefin der « Süddeutschen Zeitung » ( Freitagausgabe ) .
Merk lobte den Bischof sogar ausdrücklich für seine Worte : « Ich bin dem Bischof sehr dankbar für diese klare Stellungnahme [ … ]
Über Herrn Mixa ist viel geschrieben und gesagt worden , inzwischen dürfte klar sein , wie seine eigene Rolle in den Vorwürfen rund um die Misshandlungen zu sehen ist .
Von daher hat es mehr als eine humoristische Note , wenn jetzt der Focus veröffentlicht , wo Herr Mixa seinen “ Ruhestand ” verbringt :
Mixa verbringt Ruhestand im Frauenkloster Vom Bischofspalais in eine Zwei-Zimmer - Wohnung : Der zurückgetretene Augsburger Bischof Mixa wird künftig bei Franziskanerinnen in Fünfstetten leben .
Aber zurück zu Frau Merk :
Eben jene Frau Merk , kann man jetzt auf Spiegel Online lesen , hat zudem einen sehr eigenen Begriff von den Dingen die Zusammen gehören und stellt daraus überaus interessante Kausalketten zusammen :
“ Wenn man sich ansieht , welche Folgen der Konsum von schädlichen Videos haben kann , ist die Laissez - faire - Politik der FDP bei Kinderpornos im Netz grob fahrlässig ” , sagte die stellvertretende CSU - Vorsitzende laut dpa .
Die Missbrauchstaten Jugendlicher zeigten Verrohungstendenzen , die “ auch deshalb geschehen , weil man heutzutage im Netz problemlos alle erdenklichen Formen von Gewalt und Pornografie ansehen kann ” , sagte Merk .
Das ist im Grunde genommen einfach nur noch unerträglich .
Und eigentlich könnte man an dieser Stelle jetzt einen Aufschrei des Koalitionspartners , der FDP , erwarten .
Die ist jedoch leider derzeit mit einem sehr wichtigen Problem beschäftigt und so kann man auf dNews lesen :
Angesichts des weit verbreiteten Übergewichts hat der FDP - Politiker Erwin Lotter ein Verbot von Pommes , Cheeseburgern und anderem Fast Food für Jugendliche ins Spiel gebracht . [… ]
Es sollte verhindert werden , dass insbesondere Kinder unter 16 Jahren Fast - Food - Produkte essen .
Ich muss zugeben , ich bin mittlerweile sprachlos : Selbst die absurdesten Gedanken , die ich mir machen könnte genügen nicht , um den realen Irrsinn vorherzusehen , der uns derzeit aus Regierungskreisen bombadiert .
Allerdings habe ich auch eine gute Nachricht : Zukünftig wird es nicht mehr möglich sein , sich darüber aufzuregen .
Denn nachdem unsere Kanzlerin ja festgestellt hat , dass ihr Meinungsmonopol bröckelt , weil die Menschen sich tatsächlich verstärkt auch hier im Internet informieren , bemüht sich das BKA , jede Anonymität im Netz abzuschaffen .
Unter dem Deckmantel der Bekämpfung von wahlweise Terroristen , Kinderschändern oder Glücksspielern .
Parallel sorgt die Deutsche Post ganz im Regierungswillen dafür , dass auch in Sachen Email wieder Zucht und Ordnung herrscht und zu guter Letzt ist da noch die Ministerin Özkan , die als Ministerin in Niedersachsen nicht weniger will , als die Presse dazu zu verpflichten , wie sie demnächst was zu sagen hat .
Wo kämen wir denn da hin , wenn die aufgeklärten Bürger plötzlich mit dem aufgeklärt sein ernst machen würden ?
The Hajime restaurant in Bangkok became an international sensation this spring .
It ’s secret to success ?
Robot waiters .
The machines , made by Motoman , are dressed as samurai and glide around on tracks as they serve customers shabu - shabu style dishes made by human cooks .
They even perform fun dance numbers when things slow down .
The restaurant , with the robot system , cost almost 30 million baht ( ~$ 932,000 ) to start , but its popularity may help it earn that back rather quickly .
While we ’ve seen several customer videos of the Hajime , the associated press just picked up the story with a top notch clip of the robots in action .
Check it out below .

Liu Xianbin was arrested for publishing articles on democracy on the internet .
In the wake of the Tiananmen massacre he spent two and a half years in prison , a further 10 after founding of the Chinese Democratic Party , for " incitement to subvert state power . "
His supporters are visited by the police .
The police also threaten Yu Jie , a Protestant Christian writer , guilty of wanting to publish a book that contains criticism of Premier Wen Jiabao .
He risks a sentence of 11 years in prison , " like Liu Xiaobo ” .
All of these dissidents are signatories of Charter 08 .
Beijing ( AsiaNews ) - Former Tiananmen hero and democracy activist Liu Xianbin , has been arrested by police and charged with " incitement to subvert state power " for articles on the internet .
The news was given yesterday by the dissident ’s wife Chen Mingxian , who confirmed that Liu was arrested last June 28 after a raid on his home in Suining ( Sichuan ) .
Liu Xianbin was released about a year ago from prison , where he had served ten years once again for " inciting subversion of state power . "
A group of activists have now launched a digital on - line campaign to support him entitled " I am Liu Xianbin ” .
Some of them were stopped by police and warned " not to get too deeply involved " in these activities .
Liu , 41 , is a founding member of the Democratic Party , condemned for this ( " incitement etc. .. ) to 13 years in prison in 1999 .
He was released in November 2008 for good behaviour .
His lawyer Ma Xiaopeng says he has not been allowed to see the prosecution ’s evidence and does not know for articles Liu was arrested .
Liu also participated in the Tiananmen Square movement of ‘ 89 and was arrested for this in 1991 and sentenced to two and a half years in prison .
After his release in 2008 he continued to write articles in support of democracy and signed the Charter 08 document , which calls for political reform and religious freedom and for the Chinese government to implement a true society respectful of human rights .
One of the drafters of the Charter 08 , Liu Xiaobo , was sentenced last Christmas to 11 years in prison forever for " incitement to subvert state power . "
Liu had written articles in defence of Liu Xiaobo .
A few days ago , another signatory of Charter 08 was stopped by police and threatened with arrest .
This is the famous writer Yu Jie , who is about to distribute a book critical of Premier Wen Jiabao .
On 4 July , Yu was detained by police and interrogated for four hours , then threatened that if he published the book he will be condemned , since the book " endangers national security . "
Yu said that the police assured him " a sentence as heavy as that of Liu Xiaobo ” .
Yu , who founded the Pen Centre in China , an association of independent writers and journalists , is a Protestant Christian .
His books are banned in China .
Zakaj pa ti blogaš ?
Ha ?
No , zakaj ?
15 septembra , 2006 at 9:56 dop
Najpogostejše vprašanje mojih prijateljic zadnjih dni .
In vprašanje , ki ga prej ali slej zapiše na svoj blog skoraj vsak bloger .
Vem , vem , grozovito dolgočasno vprašanje , ki je bilo zapisano že milijonkrat .
Nekateri menijo , da blogerji blogajo zato , ker iščejo pozornost , ker hočejo biti v koraku z modernimi smernicami , ker se morajo nekako po/hvalit in izraziti ( express yourself ) , ker hočejo biti pripadniki neke skupnosti , ker želijo blog izkoristiti za svojo poslovno promocijo in dodatni zaslužek .
Nekateri blogerji menijo , da imajo za povedat pomembne reči , ki bi jih drugi ljudje morali prebrati .
Ali pa samo zato , ker je kul biti bloger ?
Priznam , tudi sama sem imela podobno mnenje pol leta nazaj .
Sploh na osnovi nekaj površno prebranih blogov , ki so to mnenje vsekakor potrjevali .
Večina ljudi meni o bloganju podobno kot Maddox .
Vzrokov za pisanje blogov ne bom kategorizirala in ne bom jih komentirala .
Saj mnogi pisci blogov pišemo tudi iz večih zelo različnih , a tudi prepletajočih se vzrokov in nagibov .
V štirih mesecih , kar sama pišem blog ( no ja vem , sem še čista fazanka , eh kaj zdaj tu pametujem ? ) , sem prišla do nekaj ugotovitev .
Predvsem pa to tega , da ljudje pišemo bloge še iz številnih drugih razlogov .
Nekateri ga uporabljajo za “ branding ” , delitev svojega znanja , pa tudi za ustvarjanje pozitivne podobe tega , s čimer se ukvarjajo .
V to kategorijo pogosto padejo “ business blogs ” .
Nekateri uporabljajo blog za izpovedno terapijo .
Namesto psihiatra .
Z izpovednimi zapisi si očistijo dušo in olajšajo bremena .
Nekateri pišejo blog , ker v resnici nimajo drugih socialnih stikov .
Pišejo zato , da nekdo bere in se z njimi pogovarja , da vedo da jih nekdo vseeno posluša .
Nekateri pišejo blog , ker neskočno radi pišejo , imajo mnenje , ki ga želijo izraziti , Nekateri uživajo v ustvarjanju , oblikovanju svojega bloga .
Kar nekaj ljudi piše blog za ustvarjanje vzajemne komunikacije .
Nekateri pišejo blog v iskanju popularnosti in rekordnih dosežkov .
Nekateri potrebujejo več samopotrjevanja .
Pisanje blogov mnogim koristi v pridobivanju novih znanj .
Ko pripravljaš prispevek za blog , se ob raziskovanju in prebiranju podobnih tem , lahko veliko naučiš .
Spet eni pišejo blog , ker živijo daleč od družine in prijateljev in so tako nekako povezani .
Zagotovo je tudi nekaj ljudi , ki blogajo v silni želji nad kontrolo – samih sebe in drugih .
Hm , teli zgoraj našteti razlogi niso kaj prida globoki , kajne ?
Večina se v kakšnem od razlogov vsaj malo najdete .
Prav veliko pa tudi ne , kajne ?
Svojo kreativnost po pisanju in ustvarjanju pa ja lahko izražamo še na številne druge načine .
Zakaj ravno blog ?
In nenazadnje : prepričana sem , da obstaja tudi kdo , ki piše blog zato , ker trdno verjame , da lahko s svojim pisanjem spreminja svet .
