How to keep footers at the bottom of the page
When an HTML page contains a small amount of content , the footer can sometimes sit halfway up the page leaving a blank space underneath .
This can look bad , particularly on a large screen .
Web designers are often asked to push footers down to the bottom of the viewport , but it 's not immediately obvious how this can be done .
When I first ditched tables for pure CSS layouts I tried to make the footer stay at the bottom but I just could n't do it .
Now , after years of practice , I have finally figured out a neat way to do it .
My method uses 100 % valid CSS and it works in all standards compliant browsers .
It also fails gracefully with older browsers so it 's safe to use on any website .
See it in action : View my demo with the footer at the bottom
The main features ...
Works in all modern , standards compliant browsers
Compatible browsers : Firefox ( Mac & PC ) , Safari ( Mac & PC ) , Internet Explorer 7 , 6 & 5.5 , Opera and Netscape 8
Fails gracefully on older browsers
Older non-standards compliant browsers position the footer under the content as per normal .
We can't help it if people are using an out of date browser , all we can do is reward people who have upgraded by giving them a better browsing experience through progressive enhancement .
Longer content pushes the footer off the page
On long pages with lots of content the footer is pushed off the visible page to the very bottom .
Just like a normal website , it will come into view when you scroll all the way down .
This means that the footer isnâ€™t always taking up precious reading space .
100 % valid CSS with no hacks
The CSS used in this demo is 100 % valid and contains no hacks .
No JavaScript required
JavaScript is not necessary because it works with pure CSS .
i Phone compatible
This method also works on the iPhone and iPod Touch in the mobile Safari browser .
Free to download
Simply save the source code of my demo page and use it however you like .
There is only one limitation .
You must set the height of the footer div to something other than auto .
Choose any height you like , but make sure the value is specified in pixels or ems within your CSS .
This is not a big limitation , but it is essential for this method to work correctly .
If you have a lot of text in your footer then it's also a good idea to give the text a bit more room at the bottom by making your footer a bit deeper .
This is to cater for people who have their browser set to a larger text size by default .
Another way to solve the same problem is to set the height of the footer in em units ; this will ensure that the footer grows in size along with the text .
If you only have images in your footer than there 's nothing to worry about â€ “ just set your footer height to a pixel value and away you go .
So how does it work ?
It 's actually not that complicated .
There are two parts to it - the HTML and the CSS .
The HTML div structure
< div id =" container " > < div id =" header " ></div > < div id =" body " ></div > < div id =" footer " ></div > </div >
There are only four divs required for this to work .
The first is a container div that surrounds everything .
Inside that are three more divs ; a header , a body and a footer .
That 's it , all the magic happens in the CSS .
The CSS
html , body { margin:0 ; padding: 0 ; height :100 % ; } #container { min-height : 100 % ; position : relative ; } #header { background : # ff0 ; padding : 10 px ; } #body { padding : 10 px ; padding - bottom : 60 px ; /* Height of the footer */ } # footer { position : absolute ; bottom: 0 ; width : 100 % ; height :60 px ; /* Height of the footer */ background : #6 cf ; }
And one simple CSS rule for IE 6 and IE 5.5 :
# container { height :100 % ; }
The HTML and body tags
The HTML and body tags must be set to height : 100 % ; this allows us to set a percentage height on our container div later .
I have also removed the margins and padding on the body tag so there are no spaces around the parameter of the page .
The container div
The container div has a min-height : 100 % ; this will ensure it stays the full height of the screen even if there is hardly any content .
Many older browsers do n't support the min-height property , there are ways around it with JavaScript and other methods but that is out of scope for this article .
The container div is also set to position : relative ; this allows us to absolutely position elements inside it later .
The header div
There is nothing unusual with the header .
Make it whatever colour and size you like .
The body div
The body is quite normal too .
The only important thing is it must have a bottom padding that is equal to ( or slightly larger than ) the height of the footer .
You can also use a bottom border if you prefer but a margin wo n't work .
The footer div
The footer has a set height in pixels ( or ems ) .
The div is absolutely positioned bottom : 0 ; this moves it to the bottom of the container div .
When there is little content on the page the container div is exactly the height of the browser viewport ( because of the min-height : 100 % ; ) and the footer sits neatly at the bottom of the screen .
When there is more than a page of content the container div becomes larger and extends down below the bottom of the viewport - the footer is still positioned at the bottom of the container div but this time you need to scroll down to the end of the page to see it .
The footer is also set to width : 100 % ; so it stretches across the whole page .
The IE 6 & IE 5.5 CSS
Older versions of Internet Explorer do n't understand the min-height property but lucky for us the normal height property behaves exactly the same way in these old Microsoft browsers , that is , it will stretch to 100 % height of the viewport but if the content is longer it will stretch even further .
We simply expose this 100 % height rule to Internet Explorer only by using IE conditional comments .
View the source on the demo to see how this is done .
So there you have it ...
A simple , valid way to make the footer get down !
I hope you find it useful .
Washington Post —
Looks like he ’s reached his boiling point .
Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - Ohio ) , the most liberal of the Democratic presidential candidates in the primary field , declared in a letter sent to his Democratic House colleagues this morning that he plans to file articles of impeachment against Vice President Dick Cheney .
Kucinich has made ending the war in Iraq the central theme of his campaign .
He has even taken aim at the leading Democratic presidential candidates in the field for their votes on authorizing the war .
Article II , Section 4 of the Constitution gives Congress the authority to impeach the president , vice president and “ all civil Officers of the United States ” for “ treason , bribery , or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors . ” ( More )
Kucinich ALSO says he ’s pursuing impeachment of Bush !
Well let ’s help him out .
Sacks and sacks of mail are about to arrive in Dennis Kucinich ’s office initiating impeachment via the House of Representative ’s own rules .
This legal document is as binding as if a State or if the House itself passed the impeachment resolution ( H.R. 635 ) .
Kucinich says he is building his case for impeachment , and is working to build the support of his peers in Congress .
He says he intends to impeach .
He said he needs us to keep building the groundswell of support for impeachment all over the country .
He asks that we send him copies of all the resolutions passed in various States , local Legislative Districts , County Districts and of any petitions with signatures , so that he can present them to the floor of the House .
He said he felt that our framing the issue of impeachment in terms of the Constitution is a principled choice , and ultimately more effective than just acting on anger .
Here ’s video of Kucinich addressing the impeachment issue :
Let ’s answer Kucinich ’s call with a petition that has it ’s precedent in history , and it ’s legitimacy in the Rules of the House of Representatives .
There ’s a little known and rarely used clause of the “ Jefferson Manual ” in the rules for the House of Representatives which sets forth the various ways in which a president can be impeached .
Only the House Judiciary Committee puts together the Articles of Impeachment , but before that happens , someone has to initiate the process .
That ’s where we come in .
In addition to a House Resolution ( 635 ) , or the State - by - State method , one of the ways to get impeachment going is for individual citizens like you and me to submit a memorial .
ImpeachforPeace.org has created a new memorial based on one which was successful in impeaching a federal official in the past .
You can find it on their website as a PDF .
You can initiate the impeachment process and simultaneously help Kucinich to follow through with the process .
Do -It - Yourself by downloading the memorial , filling in the relevant information ( your name , state , etc. ) , and sending it in .
We ’re not only having you send them to Dennis now , but also to Impeach for Peace .
That way , we can collect them all in one place , and deliver them all simultaneously ( with cameras rolling ) in July .
Be a part of history .
Help Kucinich Impeach Bush
We like to think of Mother ’s Day and Father ’s Day as days when young children give lots of hugs to their loving parents .
We do n’t like to consider that these days are also days when thousands of innocent children are beaten by their parents , their anguished cries often not heard outside of their dysfunctional homes .
Saddest of all , these children are condemned to be beaten and screamed at by the people they trust most .
In 1988 , I was waiting for an elevator at the State office building where I worked as an Assistant Attorney General .
Many social workers had their offices in the same building , and several of those social workers were also waiting for an elevator .
All of a sudden , a middle - aged man started yelling at a three - year - old boy , who started crying .
The boy weighed about 40 pounds .
The man quickly got angrier and started smacking the boy violently with the palm of his hand - maybe it was his fist .
Whump !
Whump !
Whump !
The little boy was now breathless and whimpering .
Like the other half - dozen people waiting for an elevator , however , I did nothing but stand there horrified .
The man cocked his arm back to strike the boy yet again when one of the social workers jumped forward and yelled at the man : “ Stop hitting that child ! ”
With that , the man looked confused , then angry , then more confused , then meek .
The social worker further instructed him : “ follow me . ”
The man followed the social worker , presumably to the social worker ’s office .
It did not appear that the social worker knew this man .
This social worker , now a hero in my mind , stepped forward because it was the right thing to do .
He intervened because there was a child being mistreated .
It was that simple .
I am not proud of the fact that I stood there doing nothing while the man repeatedly struck the fragile little boy .
There was a window of 15 to 20 seconds during which I could ’ve simply stepped up and told the man to stop .
Why not ?
What did I have to lose by trying ?
I was not the first person to freeze when I was uncertain of what to do .
As Robert Cialdini writes in Influence : The Psychology of Persuasion ( 1984 ) , whenever we are unsure of ourselves , “ when the situation is unclear or ambiguous , when uncertainty reigns , we are most likely to look to and accept the actions of others as correct .. . . especially in an ambiguous situation , the tendency for everyone to be looking to see what everyone else is doing can lead to a fascinating phenomenon called “ pluralistic ignorance .
[ This phenomenon of pluralistic ignorance explains ] the failure of entire groups of bystanders to aid victims in agonizing need of help . ”
( Page 129 ) The classic case of this was the homicide of Catherine Genovese , who died in Queens , New York City , when at least a dozen people failed to pick up their phones to call the police , even though they heard the awful and unmistakable sounds of Ms. Genovese being viciously attacked .
Cialdini explains this phenomenon further :
In times of uncertainty , the natural tendency is to look around at the actions of others for clues .
We can learn , from the way the other witnesses are reacting , whether the event is or is not an emergency .
What is easy to forget , though , is that everyone else observing the event is likely to be looking for social evidence , too .
And because we all prefer to appear poised and unflustered among others , we are likely to search for that evidence placidly , with brief camouflaged glances at those around us .
Therefore everyone is likely to see everyone else looking unruffled and failing to act .
As a result , and by the principle of social proof , the event will be roundly interpreted as a non-emergency . . . the fascinating upshot [ of this phenomenon is that ] the idea of “ safety in numbers ” may often be completely wrong .
While Cialdini ’s book might explain my inaction , it does not excuse it .
My shame in not acting on that occasion has provoked me to speak up during a subsequent similar situation .
But speaking up does not necessarily solve any child - abuse problems .
Speaking up might only embarrass and frustrate the parent in public .
Who is to say that that an attempt at intervention wo n’t provoke that parent to simply go home where he or she will secretly beat the holy crap out of their child ?
I recalled my own inaction when I recently heard of another child abuse incident through two friends of mine .
They were on public transportation when they heard a mother start screaming at a tiny child and beating him .
Not entirely certain of what to do , my friends turned around and glared at the woman , only to see that she had other small children in her care in addition to the small child she was attacking .
One of my friends looked straight at the woman and told her “ you need to go to parenting classes . ”
Predictably , this did not provoke goodwill on behalf of the woman .
In fact , it caused her to glare back at my friends .
As she left the train , my friends feared that the mother was going home where she could privately inflict more damage on her children .
Child abusers are cowards .
Through their actions , they claim that they have rights to beat and scream at children simply because they are the parents .
Unfortunately , the courts show great deference to violent people just because the little people the adults are punching kicking and demeaning are their own children .
At Court , then , child abusers hide behind tiny human shields .
“ Judge , you would n’t want to break up our family , would you ? ”
Child abusers , even those who have been convicted of the crime of child abuse , even those who have had children removed from their own homes , are free to have more children .
And many of them do have more children .
A friend of mine works in a family court in a large city .
He told me that he is surrounded by liberal - minded co-workers ( many of them off - the - charts liberal ) , including many child welfare workers ( those who work with abused and neglected children ) .
I asked him what most of those liberal - minded child welfare workers think of mandatory sterilization of those parents who do grievous harm to their own children or kill them .
He said that most of his liberal co-workers are in favor of mandatory sterilization under those circumstances .
His perception is that it only takes a few months of seeing the kinds of things that dangerously dysfunctional parents regularly do to innocent children before the most liberal social worker wants to shout : Stop !
No more children !
While I was going to law school , I worked in a Juvenile Court ( this was 25 years ago ) and I felt this way too .
I know that most of the people with whom I worked back then ( they were of a variety of political stripes ) felt the same as me .
Of course , this is a highly contentious topic .
Who wants to intervene in others ’ reproductive choices ?
On the other hand , this topic ( abusive parents who keep having more children ) is a topic on which our society should have an unblinkingly honestly conversation .
When a parent kills his or her own child ( not by an accident ) , should he or she be able to just keep having more children and abusing them too ?
The family courts are full of growing families who are repeat customers .
The children who survive horrific abuse often go on to commit crimes of their own before settling in to have unplanned children of their own , which they themselves abuse .
Some of those highly dysfunctional families are enormous ( 5 or 10 kids or more ) , and all 8 , 9 or 10 of them can end up in family court to be tended to by the workers who shake their heads while doing what they can .
In fact , there ’s a common saying among many ( liberal ) child welfare workers : “ Do n’t breed them if you ca n’t feed them . ”
How bad does child - abuse get ?
You might not have the stomach for this dark reality , but consider reading the case studies found at this article at Wikipedia .
( they are listed under the title “ Notable incidents of child abuse ” ) .
Then consider the grim statistics :
An estimated 872,000 children were determined to be victims of child abuse or neglect for 2004 . . .
More than 60 percent of child victims were neglected by their parents or other caregivers .
About 18 percent were physically abused , 10 percent were sexually abused , and 7 percent were emotionally maltreated .
In addition , 15 percent were associated with “ other ” types of maltreatment based on specific State laws and policies .
A child could be a victim of more than one type of maltreatment .
I have two young children ( ages six and eight ) .
My wife and I work hard to nurture them and challenge them .
Doing this takes an enormous amount of discipline .
I could name a dozen All - Star parents that have inspired me to try to be a better parent myself .
None of them makes parenting look easy .
Parenting is hard rowing , and there are not many shortcuts to doing the job well .
Feeding the children and giving them a place to sleep is the bare minimum .
In our competitive society , conscientious parents need to teach their children many skills they will need to survive as citizens and human beings .
After being a parent for a few months , I was startled to learn that being a good parent is as difficult as being a lawyer , a doctor or an airplane pilot .
Parenting is a profession that is equally exhausting .
Many people lack the basic skills to take care of children , however .
We occasionally see these parents in the relatively few places where socio- economic classes mix , such as on mass transit and sidewalks .
When we see these parents lash out at their children , physically and emotionally , we want to run away and magically forget what we just saw .
It ’s just too damned awful to contemplate what it ’s like for those children to be stuck in those homes .
So , what can we do about such dangerous parents ?
For one , we need to realize that we , as a society , are standing around succumbing to “ pluralistic ignorance . ”
No one else is doing much of anything , so we do n’t either .
There ’s lots of miniature Catherine Genoveses getting hurt , and most of us are doing nothing but looking the other way .
This issue is not about inflicting reproductive restrictions upon people because they have fewer social economic resources or because they are of differing “ races ” ( to me , “ race ” is a useless term ) .
What I am about to propose is equally relevant to every parent everywhere in America : Having children is a privilege and it triggers a heavy responsibility .
Parents who are documented child abusers should not be allowed to have more children .
We commonly take away privileges when people demonstrate that they are unqualified to engage in dangerous activity .
Habitual drunks are not allowed to drive cars .
Incompetent doctors and lawyers ( at least the worst of them ) are not allowed to continue practicing medicine or law .
Similarly , incompetent parents should not be allowed to create additional children .
Here are my two proposals :
Proposal One
Any person who , on two or more occasions , A ) is convicted of child abuse or
B ) who is deemed so incompetent as a parent that a court removes a child from his or her home for an extended period ( e.g. , more than six months )
should be sterilized .
A parent qualifies if he or she has any two of the above — 2 A’s , 2B ’s or an A & a B .
The people to be sterilized would be those who have been convicted of child abuse or from whose homes the children were removed .
If both parents qualify , then both should be sterilized .
I fully understand that accusations are often thrown around as part of divorce cases .
Irate spouses sometimes accuse perfectly innocent people of abusing their children .
On the other hand , consider this situation : if a person is convicted of child abuse on one occasion and then has another child removed from their home , are n’t we fairly confident that this is not the sort of person who should be allowed to have custody of more children ?
Proposal Two
We should institute government programs along the lines of Project Prevention .
Project prevention offers cash incentives to women who are addicted to drugs and / or alcohol to use long - term or permanent birth control .
Here ’s an excerpt from an article describing the problem and Project Prevention ’s solution :
After Cathy Mayne saw a flyer near her grandson ’s elementary school that read , “ If you ’re addicted to drugs , get birth control — get cash ! ” she called CRACK on Nicole ’s behalf .
The organization ’s premise is radical , if dizzyingly simple : CRACK gives addicts $ 200 ( they ’ll throw in an extra $ 50 if a participant recommends a friend ) and sets up the medical procedures at a public hospital or clinic .
All Nicole had to do was sign a release form , and two weeks later she had her tubes tied at a local hospital .
She received a check the following month .
Here ’s another article describing Project Prevention ’s plan .
Many organizations , such as the ACLU , strongly object to programs like Project Prevention .
See here , for example .
( and see here and here ) .
These sites argue that waving cash in front of crack addict is taking advantage of them .
I do n’t agree .
In my opinion , if you ca n’t turn down $ 200 for immediate gratification , you ’re not qualified to be a parent in the first place .
To be a real parent , you need to be able to exercise constant self - sacrifice .
The good parents I know say “ no ” to their own urges dozens of times every day .
Good parents constantly sacrifice their needs for those of their children .
Anything less characterizes an suspect parent .
Not too long ago , I compared the process for adopting a child from China to the ability of dangerous parents to have additional biological children .
My wife and I understood that we needed to be fully qualified and trustworthy in order to raise a child .
Therefore , we acquiesced to the Chinese requirement to produce a clean criminal record and to show that we were in good health , that we had people willing to step forward and recommend us as parents , and that we were willing to invite a social worker over for a home study .
How different it is when someone wants to have an additional child biologically !
Under current law , it is no hurdle to having additional children that you have had 4 , 5 or six children taken away from you because you have been declared dangerous .
It is no hurdle that you are constantly high on crack cocaine .
It is no hurdle that you allow your current children to wallow in their feces , that you ’ve threatened to kill your them or that you are screwing them up so badly that they will never have a chance to take advantage of any school , no matter how good .
Under current law , you can have more of your own biological children no matter how crappy and dangerous you are as a parent .
The topic of eligibility requirements for having one ’s own biological baby is truly a 3rd rail of American politics .
So much so , that we ca n’t even discuss the possibility of requiring the sterilization of people who are certified as likely to maim or kill their own children .
Oh , well , I just mentioned it .
How awful that I would dare to suggest that to have biological children , a potential parent must not have a track record of hurting or killing his / her own children !
The widespread reluctance to discuss this issue surprises me , because people convicted of child abuse are n’t noted for having a strong governmental lobby .
Anyway , it ’s time to start this conversation .
Allowing parents who are dangerous to have more children is irresponsible .
It is dangerous to victims too small and too young to protect themselves .
It drains the energy of our society to bear the costs of children who are being tortured , who then often grow up to do the torturing .
Maybe you disagree .
Maybe you do n’t think I ’ve set the bar in the right place , but should n’t there be a bar somewhere ?
At some point , should we dictate to dangerous parents that they can’t have more children ?
At bottom , here ’s how I think of it .
Every child deserves to have a safe and loving home .
Every child is interconnected with my world .
Every child is , in essence , my child .
It ’s time to have a dialogue to determine how to stop this cycle of violence .
The security firm Blackwater USA today resumed limited escorts of American personnel in the Iraqi capital after an incident in which eight civilians died , the US embassy in Iraq said .
As Blackwater guards returned to the streets of Baghdad after a three - day suspension , the Iraqi interior ministry said it planned to end immunity from prosecution for security contractors .
The interior ministry spokesman Major General Abdul - Kareem Khalaf said the ministry had drafted legislation giving it tighter control over contractors and calling for " severe punishment for those who fail to adhere to the ... guidelines " .
Iraq has said it will review the status of all security firms after what it called a flagrant assault by Blackwater contractors in which at least eight people were killed while the firm was escorting a US embassy convoy through Baghdad on Sunday .
The US and Iraq are planning a joint inquiry amid conflicting accounts of what happened .
Blackwater said its staff acted " lawfully and appropriately " after coming under attack .
But the Iraqi government insisted Blackwater had opened fire on innocent civilians .
The deaths have created fresh tensions between the US and Iraq .
The Iraqi prime minister , Nuri al - Maliki , suggested the US embassy should stop using Blackwater and said he would not allow Iraqis to be killed " in cold blood " .
The US embassy spokeswoman Mirembe Nantongo said the decision to allow Blackwater to guard some " mission essential " trips was made after talking to Iraqi authorities .
" There is n't a lot of movement in general ...
But it is likely Blackwater will support some of them , " she told the Reuters news agency .
The killings angered Iraqis , who regard the tens of thousands of security contractors working in the country as mercenaries operating with little regard for Iraqis .
Mr Khalaf said the new draft law , which he expected parliament to pass soon , gave the ministry powers to prosecute the companies and to refuse or revoke contracts .
Many security firms operating in Iraq have no valid licence and a law issued by US administrators after the 2003 invasion , which granted them immunity from prosecution , has not been formally revoked .
The New York Times reported on Friday that the interior ministry would also propose that foreign security companies be replaced by Iraqi firms .
" These American companies were established in a time when there was no authority or constitution , " the newspaper quoted a ministry report as saying .
The head of an association of security firms in Iraq said replacing foreign companies with Iraqi ones was not a new suggestion , but was unlikely to happen overnight .
" One alternative would be partnerships with Iraqi companies , putting an Iraqi face on what we 're doing , " Lawrence Peter , the director of the Private Security Company Association of Iraq , told Reuters .
Blackwater is the biggest of three private security firms employed by the US state department in Iraq .
Private security staff who are involved in controversial incidents are often hastily withdrawn , but those involved in the Sunday shootings were still in Iraq .
Intelligence provided by local Iraqis led the troops to the torture centre
Three buildings containing chains on the walls and ceilings , and a metal bed connected to a power supply were found during an operation on 9 December .
Mass graves containing 26 bodies were uncovered nearby , the military said .
Correspondents say Diyala has been the focus of some of the fiercest attacks by insurgents in recent months .
Militants displaced from their former strongholds in Anbar province and parts of Baghdad by the US troop surge are believed to have migrated to the province .
Earlier on Tuesday , a suicide bomber killed 13 people and a US soldier in an attack on a recruiting centre for local Sunni Arab militia groups that have been fighting al - Qaeda - linked militants in Diyala .
' Atrocity site '
The grisly discovery of what the US military called an atrocity site and torture complex north of Muqdadiya was made during a security operation more than two weeks ago , but announced only on Thursday .
Evidence of murder , torture , and intimidation against local villagers was found throughout the area
US military statement
Pictures of the complex
" Intelligence provided by Iraqi tips led US troops to a suspected al - Qaeda in Iraq safe haven and operating bases , " the US statement said .
" Evidence of murder , torture , and intimidation against local villagers was found throughout the area . "
Residents of nearby villages said they had known about the torture complex , but had not told the authorities because they had been afraid of reprisals by the militants .
A local policeman told the Associated Press news agency that he thought the chamber had been in use for about a year .
The troops initially discovered what appeared to be a detention facility , near which they found the bodies of 26 people in " multiple mass graves next to execution sites " , the statement said .
" In the same area a torture complex was found , consisting of three detention facilities with one doubling as both a headquarters building and torture facility , " it added .
" The buildings contained chains on the walls and ceilings , a bed still hooked up to an electrical system , and several bloodstained items . "
Written in white paint on one wall above the bed was a Koranic phrase used to welcome a guest : " All who enter it shall be safe . "
The US military commander in northern Iraq , Maj Gen Mark Hertling , said he believed the torture facility had been run by al - Qaeda in Iraq as it was located in one of their strongholds .
Graffiti on the site also mentioned the Islamic State of Iraq , an umbrella group that includes al - Qaeda in Iraq and other Sunni Arab insurgents .
After uncovering the site , the troops continued their security sweep of the area and killed 24 suspected militants , Gen Hertling said .
The torture complex was not the first to have been discovered in Iraq .
In March , US troops found a similar site in the village of Karma in the western province of Anbar .
They rescued two Iraqis who said they had been spared immediate execution because the militants had wanted to film the killings and their video camera had broken .
Keppel Bay District has always been one of the most highly sought after residential area and given that there are a lot of transformation around the area .
The transformations bring about new amenitiess .
District 9 , 10 and 11 are the traditional prime locations for residential properties in Singapore .
However given that there are many locals who are keenly keeping and got for prime areas that are located outside of the Orchard area is that appears and is very high , district for along the harbourfront area as well as to Sentosa area under prime considerations for residents who are looking for alternative prime area to looking that is close to the Orchard city area as well as the central business district such as Raffles Place and Marina Bay financial centre .
The Reef at King ’s Dock is an alternative residential development that buyers are looking at and the site floorplans of the development will be available for viewing soon .
The developer for The Reef Harbourfront Avenue is Mapletree Trust and Keppel Group and his 2 developers are very reputable for the real estate projects in Singapore .
To projects previously along Harbourfront Avenue which is Reflections at Keppel Bay and Corals at Keppel Bay .
Reflections @ Keppel Bay and Corals at Keppel Bay have received good feedback from owners given that the quality of the furnishings located inside the development are very well taken care of and the layout is very simple with squarish layout and there is no fixed a short space .
All the space there is available for the floorplan at The Reef Keppel Bay are fully utilised which makes it a very efficient layout for stay .
The Reef at King ’s Dock is located at district for along Harbourfront Avenue which is highly sought after given that the location is located near to many amenities as well as public transportation .
Public transportation remains from the key factors when considering new developments for own stay then the reason is because conveniences play an important part in everyday life .
Residents will want to walk to nearby amenities instead of having to wait for buses or take a very long walk under the harbourfront to get and they need necessities .
A look at the Singapore man shows that The Reef Harbourfront Avenue location is highly prime and that there are plenty of amenities near to the development and public transport options are also not an issue for The Reef at King ’s Dock .
The last Vivocity and the map and we can see that The Reef at King ’s Dock is just a few minutes walk away from Vivocity MRT Station .
Vivocity MRT
Station is not just another MRT station as it is and MRT Station that links the Circle line and the North East line .
This will mean that residents who are travelling to other parts of Singapore such as Punggol and Sengkang will be able to take the North East line which takes it directly to the north - east part of Singapore .
Also , for residents prefer to take their public transportation to other parts of Singapore , The Reef Harbourfront Avenue will also be in the mine and the reason is because location of the development is near to public transportation networks such as how MRT station as well as buses along Telok Blangah Road .
There are many buses along this major that takes you to other parts of Singapore such as Bishan , Ang Mo Kio , is as well as other parts of Singapore .
Residents of The Reef at King ’s Dock condo may also be more affluent and therefore may be looking at their own transports with your car and therefore may be looking for developments there near to expressways as well as major roads .

The Reef at King ’s Dock is also near to many amenities is critical to are buyers view when it comes to selection of the condo .
The amenities is not just also a shopping centre or MRT station but The Reef Harbourfront Avenue is located near to Sentosa which is the ultimate seafront entertainment centre that caters to all walks of life .
Sentosa is a tourist spot the features many outdoor amenities such as integrated resorts as well as greenbacks to cater to the residents .
Resort world Sentosa is located at Sentosa and there are many features that is welcoming for the residents of the development .
Universal Studios will definitely be one of the main highlights of stay at The Reef at King ’s Dock Harbourfront Avenue District 04 .
Stay located near to schools is is one of the most important thing that buyers can get as located near to school means that children do not have to spend too much time travelling and it is also less dangerous for the children as well .
Being located near to schools also means that parents do not have to spend too much time travelling as well .
The Reef at King ’s Dock is located near to school .
Popular among the lookers as well as foreigners and therefore the new development by Mapletree Trust and Keppel Group will be highly popular .
Schools such as CHIJ Kellock Primary School as well as Radin Mas Primary School which are to popular schools of the locals are available for the residents to choose from .
Being located near to schools are specially within 1 km is would mean that there is a priority given to residents who are staying within 1 km away and The Reef Condo Keppel Bay is located just right away from the schools making it a popular new launch for families with kids which are going to school .
When it is come to selection of the new condo , capital gain may be one of the few things that buyers are looking at as buying a new property involves a huge sum of money and Moors buyers who want the property to appreciate over the long term .
One of the things that will allow the property to appreciate besides being located near to transportation and amenities is transformation around the area .
Transformation bring about new amenities and new conveniences and to a greater extent , new offices and therefore this will mean there will be rental demand and hence the prices of the property would appreciate if there is transformation around the area .
A look at the news see is that The Reef Condo Keppel Bay location is near to Singapore ’s greatest transformation which is the Greater Southern Waterfront .
The Greater Southern Waterfront will consist of Singapore ’s see in transformation around the for them part of Singapore and external westwards all the way towards Tuas .
The 1st one of the Greater Southern Waterfront will mean that there will be expansion of the current Marina Bay financial is district and all the way to the Pasir Panjang Terminals .
There will be more amenities located in the Greater Southern Waterfront which consists of offices as well as retail which brings in more convenience as and of course shopping centres to the residents around District 04 around Harbourfront Avenue the area .
The Reef at King ’s Dock will stand to gain from this transformation given that it is located near the Greater Southern Waterfront where a wide range of holes of amenities are available to the residents of the development .
The Greater Southern Waterfront will be Singapore ’s biggest transformation and is highly sought after by residents and this will mean the more residents as well as tenants will move into the area .
The showflat for The Reef Condo Keppel Bay will be available for viewing soon and will consist of different layouts to cater to different buyers .
The layouts will feature 1B room which are perfect for investors who are looking for iconic developments that are near to amenities such as Vivocity Shopping Centre and Vivocity MRT Station .
The 1B room layout generally will be more spacious for the developer for this development given that they have received feedbacks from other buyers that the 1B room is sometimes too small and therefore buyers will be looking for bigger layouts more for more comfortable own stay as well .
The more popular 2B room layouts will also be available and this will be perfect for young couples who are just starting out with a small family or tenants who are looking for a big and layout to rent .
Generally needed to be room some more popular in centre development and therefore The Reef at King ’s Dock developer Mapletree Trust and Keppel Group has committed to view more 2B room layouts in the development .
Olbermann : Another dangerous Bush crony at Utah mine rescue David Edwards and Nick Juliano
Published : Friday August 17 , 2007

The officials charged with protecting the safety of six Utah miners who have been trapped underground for more than 10 days " may have wound up only protecting the people who made money off their sweat , " MSNBC host Keith Olbermann said Thursday night .
Olbermann 's excoriation of mine - safety oversight came before news emerged that three rescue workers were killed and another six injured in a second cave - in .
It remains unknown whether the initial six miners are alive or dead .
In Thursday night 's broadcast of Countdown , Olbermann was sharply critical of Richard Stickler , head of the Mine Safety and Health Administration .
Olbermann reminds viewers that Stickler , former mining company executive , has faced criticism in the past of overseeing mines with higher - than - average accident rates and ignoring problems that led to other disasters .
" When Mr. Bush nominated him for his current post , " Olbermann says of Stickler , " he was opposed by the miner 's union , the AFL - CIO , a Sago widow , eight out of nine Quecreek miners , Congressional Democrats and enough Republicans that Mr. Bush had to circumvent the Senate entirely to put Mr. Stickler into his current position last year as a recess appointment . "
Early Friday morning , MSNBC reported on the latest setbacks in the rescue effort .
Another seismic event late Thursday caused the walls to cave in around rescue workers who were working their way toward the trapped miners .
No one knows the cause of the " bump " that caused the cave in , killing three workers and injuring six .
" We also know in the past couple of days , 12 of the rescue workers who were working right up against that collapse said they no longer wanted to work there because they were afraid for their own safety , " correspondent Michelle Kosinski reported Friday .
The following video is from MSNBC's Countdown and MSNBC's First Look , broadcast on August 16 and 17 .
What broadband speed are you clocking up ?
Some 3,000 readers took part in speed tests and 62 % found they routinely got less than half of the top speed advertised by their provider .
It is the latest in a series of questions over the way net firms advertise broadband services .
Regulator Ofcom said it was aware of the issue and was " investigating " .
Testing times
The figures were gathered from more than 100,000 speed tests that the 3,000 respondents carried out to build up a picture of their average net - browsing speed on ADSL lines .
Statistics about net users in the UK show that half of current broadband users receive ADSL services that should run at speeds between one and four megabits per second ( mbps ) .
The other 50 % are on deals offering up to eight mbps but the tests revealed that , in reality , very few achieve the top speeds .
" This problem has been building for a while with a growing gulf between what is advertised and what is delivered , " said Paul Allen , editor of Computeractive .
" The adverts often have super - fast broadband in huge lettering with the " up to " clause in very small print , " he said .
Broadband is often not as fast as advertised
Some 28 % of the 3,000 respondents who took the ADSL speed test found that they received less than a quarter of their maximum advertised bandwidth .
While consumers may currently not notice their sluggish connections , this could change thinks Mr Allen .
" Previously it has not been a massive issue but in the coming year we are entering the net TV age and video content is bandwidth - hungry , " he said .
Mr Allen called on regulator Ofcom to provide an independent speed test to anyone who has signed up to receive broadband .
Speaking for the telecommunications watchdog , a spokesman said : " We are looking at this issue .
It is not a huge driver of complaints but it has come on to our radar screen . "
" It 's about the difference between the headline rate and the rate received , " he said .
The spokesman said Ofcom was working with the net industry and other organisations such as Which to investigate the extent of the problem and what can be done about it .
" Once we have carried out this work we will assess what options might be available to tackle it , " he said .
The results of the investigation would be made available in the " near future " , said the spokesman .
Fast chance
Research by market analysts Point Topic sugggests that , in many areas of the UK , few people will be able to get the fastest broadband speeds .
Only 5 % of the population will be able to enjoy speeds of 18 Mbps .
More than half will only be able to get 8 Mbps .
People are using more bandwidth - hungry applications
Ofcom was also working with the Advertising Standards Authority to keep an eye on how net service firms word their marketing materials .
" We make sure broadband advertising does not advertise speeds that cannot be guaranteed , " he said .
" They have to make it clear that there is a best possible speed rather than an average speed . "
The ASA has investigated several cases of misleading promotions , most recently asking Bulldog to make it clear in its adverts that speed was dependent on how far away from the exchange people lived .
It ruled that broadband providers could use the words " up to " 8 M bps when describing services as long as customers were likely to get close to those speeds .
A survey last month by consumer group
Which found that consumers with services promising speeds of up to 8 M bps were actually getting an average speed of 2.7 Mbps .
There are many variables that determine the speed of a connection , including how far away from the telephone exchange the line is , how many others are using the line at the same time and the quality of the wiring within a home .
The tool used in the study is available for download from the Computeractive website .
It was developed by advice service Broadband Choice .
Computeractive has also launched an e-petition on the Downing Street website , asking the government to force net service firms to provide clear information about the typical speed users will receive alongside the maximum speed .
When Storm was released , one of the comments made was that it did not include the ability to generate a database schema from the Python classes used to represent the tables while this feature is available in a number of competing ORMs .
The simple reason for this is that we have n’t used schema generation in any of our ORM - using projects .
Furthermore I ’d argue that schema generation is not really appropriate for long lived projects where the data stored in the database is important .
Imagine developing an application along these lines :
Write the initial version of the application .
Generate a schema from the code .
Deploy one or more instances of the application in production , and accumulate some data .
Do further development on the application , that involves modifications to the schema .
Deploy the new version of the application .
In order to perform step 5 , it will be necessary to modify the existing database to match the new schema .
These changes might be in a number of forms , including :
adding or removing a table
adding or removing a column from a table
changing the way data is represented in a particular column
refactoring one table into two related tables or vice versa
adding or removing an index
Assuming that you want to keep the existing data , it is n’t enough to simply represent the new schema in the updated application : we need to know how that new schema relates to the old one in order to migrate the existing data .
For some changes like addition of tables , it is pretty easy to update the schema given knowledge of the new schema .
For others it is more difficult , and will often require custom migration logic .
So it is likely that you will need to write a custom script to migrate the schema and data .
Now we have two methods of building the database schema for the application :
generate a schema from the new version of the application .
generate a schema from the old version of the application , then run the migration script .
Are you sure that the two methods will result in the same schema ?
How about if we iterate the process another 10 times or so ?
As a related question , are you sure that the database environment your tests are running under match the production environment ?
The approach we settled on with Launchpad development was to only deal with migration scripts and not generate schemas from the code .
The migration scripts are formulated as a sequence of SQL commands to migrate the schema and data as needed .
So to set up a new instance , a base schema is loaded then patched up to the current schema .
Each patch leaves a record in the database that it has been applied so it is trivial to bring a database up to date , or check that an application is in sync with the database .
When the schema is not generated from the code , it also means that the code can be simpler .
As far as Python ORM layer is concerned , does it matter what type of integer a field contains ?
Does the Python code care what indexes or constraints are defined for the table ?
By only specifying what is needed to effectively map data to Python objects , we end up with easy to understand code without annotations that probably can’t specify everything we want anyway .
A reader writes :
Where we diverge , I think , is in our views of last night 's debate .
Yes , McCain shone on the torture issue ; we 've come to expect that from him .
And if I were more devout , I too would say " God bless him " for it .
And yet I can't quite get past the cheapness and pettiness of McCain 's rhetorical tactics .
I refer specifically to his exchange with Paul over Iraq , to which you also objected .
Like you , I am torn between Ron Paul and John McCain as my Republican candidate of choice in the Presidential election .
I would be quite proud to cast a vote for either ; Paul 's uncompromising dedication to true conservatism is inspiring , and McCain 's personal honor , and his credibility as a leader in the struggle against Islamist repression , are appealing .
We all want to believe in John McCain .
But moral credibility is a double - edged sword .
As valuable a commodity as it is when employed for honorable purposes , it is all the more dangerous when employed in pursuit of ignoble ends .
In other words : when Rudy Giuliani says shallow , puerile , and dishonorable things , it bugs me , but it does n’t SCARE me , because everybody expects that of Giuliani .
We all know his supporters and opponents alike that he ’s a political animal and a turd of a human being , and his use of a tactic does nothing to burnish its credibility .
When John McCain employs his moral force in an unworthy rhetorical tactic , that ’s another matter entirely .
The tactic comes to seem less offensive because a person of McCain ’s moral stature engages in it .
And that , in turn , leads me to wonder whether we can afford to have a man of McCain ’s moral stature engaged in the process of Presidential politics .
Because when John McCain debases himself , he debases us all .
And it disappoints me far , far more than anything Rudy Giuliani could possibly do .
America needs Ron Paul , and America needs John McCain .
But we need them both at their best .
And time after time , it seems to me , the demands of Presidential politics have caused John McCain to stoop , and Ron Paul to elevate himself .
It 's increasingly hard for me to see myself rewarding John McCain for this behavior by endorsing him .
Taken together , the decisions reflected the remarkable trajectory the court has traveled in the seven years since it overturned a New Jersey hate - crime statute on the ground that the law gave judges an unconstitutional degree of authority to make the crucial factual determinations that added a hate - crime “ enhancement ” to an ordinary criminal sentence .
Along with their diminished function under the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 , which set up the federal sentencing guidelines system , federal judges appeared to have been all but ejected from their role at the heart of criminal sentencing .
Judges still may not impose sentences above the range written into law by Congress or state legislatures .
But the decision on Monday gives judges broad discretion to impose sentences higher or lower than the guidelines , which are not statutes and are issued by the United States Sentencing Commission .
The two decisions answered questions left hanging in 2005 , when the court ruled in United States v. Booker that the federal sentencing guidelines could be constitutional only if “ advisory ” rather than mandatory .
Appeals courts were to review sentences for “ reasonableness , ” the court said then .
But the court did not say what it meant by either “ advisory ” or “ reasonableness . ”
Last June , in Rita v. United States , the court ruled that appeals courts could choose to presume that sentences within the guidelines range were reasonable , but that such a presumption was not binding .
But that opinion was quite opaque and said relatively little about the trial judge ’s role .
After telling four million Americans last week that Democrats were coddling terrorists because of the House FISA bill , Joe Klein now tells us about that bill :
I have neither the time nor legal background to figure out who 's right [...] about this minor detail of a bill that will never find its way out of the Congress .
Well , perhaps he should 've told his readers that from the start , before he accused an entire party of coddling terrorists .
It was a BIG ENOUGH DETAIL of a bill that he wrote an entire column on it for Time Magazine .
Now , he can't be bothered to figure things out ?
It 's not even that difficult to figure out !
Remember , Klein originally based his " Democrats are weak on national security " column on this one sentence :
Unfortunately , Speaker Nancy Pelosi quashed the House Intelligence Committee 's bipartisan effort and supported a Democratic bill that —
Limbaugh is salivating — would require the surveillance of every foreign - terrorist target 's calls to be approved by the FISA court [...]
So once again , let 's look at the text of the legislation that is SO VEXING poor Joe Klein :
' CLARIFICATION OF ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE OF NON - UNITED STATES PERSONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES '
Sec. 105A . ( a ) Foreign to Foreign Communications - ( 1 ) IN GENERAL - Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act , a court order is not required for electronic surveillance directed at the acquisition of the contents of any communication between persons that are not known to be United States persons and are reasonably believed to be located outside the United States for the purpose of collecting foreign intelligence information , without respect to whether the communication passes through the United States or the surveillance device is located within the United States .
To me it 's pretty clear , even if I do have a legal background .
I 'm pretty sure it 's pretty clear to you as well -- even if you do n't have a law degree .
But to Klein ?
I have neither the time nor legal background to figure out who 's right [...]
An intrepid reporter he's not , even though his entire fucking job is to write one column a week , a few blog posts , and the occasional book review for the New York Times .
Glenn , of course , is all over it :
[ F ] or now , I just want to ask that everyone ponder the extreme lack of professionalism and corruption required for someone like Klein to write the article that he did accusing Democrats of wanting to give Terrorists the same rights as Americans ( therefore showing , as always , that Democrats can't be trusted on national security ) , and then -- once he is exposed for having spewed outright falsehoods -- he announces that he really is n't interested in bothering to find out ( and is n't even capable of determining ) if anything he wrote was accurate .
As Glenn points out , this is all par for the course for Time .
Wired 's Ryan Singel points out that Klein is still getting it wrong , no matter how many times he blogs about the original column ( now in its fourth explanation ) .
ATLANTA , Oct. 16 — Nearly 19,000 people died in the United States in 2005 after being infected with virulent drug - resistant bacteria that have spread rampantly through hospitals and nursing homes , according to the most thorough study of the disease ’s prevalence ever conducted .
The government study , which is being published Wednesday in The Journal of the American Medical Association , suggests that such infections may be twice as common as previously thought , according to its lead author , Dr. R. Monina Klevens .
If the mortality estimates are correct , the number of deaths associated with the germ , methicillin - resistant Staphylococcus aureus , or MRSA , would exceed those attributed to H.I.V. - AIDS , Parkinson ’s disease , emphysema or homicide each year .
By extrapolating data collected in nine places , the researchers estimated that 94,360 patients developed an invasive infection from the pathogen in 2005 and that nearly one of every five , or 18,650 of them , died .
The study points out that it is not always possible to determine whether a death is caused by MRSA or merely accelerated by it .
Also called micropsia , this condition distorts visual perception so that objects that are close appear disproportionately tiny , as though viewed through the wrong end of a telescope .
It owes its name to Lewis Carroll 's fictional protagonist , Alice , who perceived things as too small or too big after taking magical medicines .
Usually temporary in nature , the syndrome is associated with migraines .
Carroll suffered migraines , so perhaps he was describing his own experiences .
PICA
This is a compulsive appetite for non-edible items , including clay , stones , cigarette ash , paint , glue , laundry starch , ice and even hair .
Found among pregnant women and young children , particularly in poorer areas , it 's thought to relate to nutritional deficiencies and may be treated with mineral supplements .
However , that 's just one of many theories about pica , whose precise causes are unknown .
It 's also found among brain damaged or mentally ill people , among whom it can take particularly dangerous turns including swallowing sharp objects ( known as acuphagia ) .
Undigested items can also form bezoars - calcified " stones " - in the stomach .
FOREIGN ACCENT SYNDROME
Imagine suddenly putting on a convincing French accent .
Or Scottish .
Or Italian .
It sounds like fun , but it's no joke for the victims of Foreign Accent Syndrome , which can set in after strokes or other brain trauma .
Without warning , they 'll start speaking their native tongue with a different accent , which could sound anything from Swedish to South African .
Victims need never have heard the accent in question , according to Oxford University researchers Dr Jennifer Gurd and Dr John Coleman , who believe it arises from damage to areas of the brain responsible for language production , altering pitch , pronunciation and speech patterns .
So people with the syndrome are n't putting on a foreign accent , it just sounds that way .
ONDINE'S CURSE
A wonderful name for a nasty problem , this is a sleep disorder resulting from a malfunctioning autonomic nervous system .
Its victims are unable to breathe spontaneously but must consciously will each breath , so will suffocate if they fall asleep .
Respirators may help .
Also known as congenital central alveolar hypoventilation syndrome , Ondine 's Curse derives its name from the legend of a water nymph , Ondine , who fell in love with a human , thereby forfeiting her immortality .
Though he had pledged his undying love , Ondine discovered him snoring in the arms of another woman .
She cursed him , declaring that as he had pledged his love with every waking breath , he would die the moment he fell asleep .
ALIEN HAND SYNDROME
Another condition arising from brain trauma , this bizarre syndrome involves losing control of one hand , which can do anything from gesticulating to unbuttoning clothes its owner is trying to put on with his or her other hand .
The condition is also called Dr Strangelove Syndrome , thanks to Peter Sellers ' inspired performance as Dr Strangelove in Stanley Kubrick 's 1964 film .
Sellers 's mechanical hand alternated between throttling himself and throwing Nazi salutes .
While victims can still experience sensation in the affected hand , they say it seems to have a mind of its own .
The only solution is to keep it busy , for example by holding onto something - just not , hopefully , your own throat .
POLYDACTYLISM
Still on the subject of hands , polydactylism is a congenital abnormality involving being born with too many digits , ranging from rudimentary nubbins to fully formed fingers or toes .
While rare , polydactylism is prevalent among communities given to intermarriage , such as Philadelphia 's Old Order Amish .
Notables with the condition have included Henry VIII 's ill - fated second wife Anne Boleyn ( whose extra pinky sparked rumours of her being a witch ) , war photographer Robert Capa and cricketer Garry Sobers .
According to The Guinness Book of Records , the record for extra digits goes to Indian brothers Tribhuwan and Triloki Yadav , who boast 20 fingers , four thumbs and 24 toes between them .
CAPGRAS SYNDROME
A loved one has been stolen by a doppelganger ; sounds like a movie about alien abduction .
But for sufferers of Capgras Syndrome , the action occurs only in their brains , not outer space .
This syndrome involves the delusion that a significant other , such as a parent , spouse or other relative , is being impersonated by an imposter .
Sufferers sometimes attack the supposed double .
The delusion can also extend even to oneself , with the person convinced that the reflection in the mirror is that of an imposter .
While extremely rare , it is linked with brain damage , psychotic disorders and various neurological problems that somehow interfere with normal face recognition abilities .
The syndrome owes its name to the French psychiatrist who first described it .
RILEY - DAY SYNDROME
Feeling no pain ; it does n't sound like a problem , but it can be lethal for the victims of a syndrome involving , among other symptoms , insensitivity to pain .
Caused by a chromosomal abnormality found among Ashkenazi Jews - people of Eastern European Jewish descent - the syndrome makes its victims exceptionally accident - prone because they simply do n't register warning signs of tissue damage such as wounds , bruising and burns .
They are even oblivious to oxygen deprivation , which means that when they hold their breath , as infants often do , they do so until they black out .
Riley - Day patients tend to die young - around half before the age of 30 - from their injuries .
JERUSALEM SYNDROME
This one sounds like the title of a Robert Ludlum thriller , but it 's actually a religious psychosis triggered by a visit to Jerusalem .
Observed since medieval times , its victims may believe that they are prophets and parade around the city proclaiming the Holy Writ or exhorting sinners to repent .
Affecting around 100 tourists per year , it generally clears up once they leave town .
However , it can have serious repercussions , as with the widespread rioting that ensued when Australian man Michael Rohan set fire to the al - Aqsa Mosque on the Temple Mount in 1969 , convinced he was the " Lord 's emissary " .
HYPERTRICHOSIS
People with hypertrichosis , a congenital condition involving hair growing all over the body - including eyelids and even ears , which can sprout long curls - have always attracted enormous interest , especially as sideshow stars .
Probably the most famous was JoJo the Dog - Faced Boy ( aka Fedor Jeftichew , a Russian recruited by showman P.T. Barnum ) , who toured widely during the latter half of the 19th century .
There are different forms of hypertrichosis , distinguished by varying hair type , quantity and distribution .
Some cases also have a little hairy appendage called a faun tail .
PENIS PANIC
Koro is one of a number of names for a hysterical condition known medically as Genital Retraction Syndrome , whose victims become convinced that their genitals are disappearing into their bodies .
It can be contagious , sparking off " penis panics " , such as the one that overtook Singapore in 1967 in which thousands of men became convinced that their penises were being stolen ; it was contained by a complete media blackout on the condition .
Often blamed on witchcraft , Koro typically strikes in less developed parts of the world , including Africa and Asia , where belief in sorcery remains strong .
It 's thought to be an extreme overreaction to normal genital shrinking from cold or other causes .
Koro can be treated with medical reassurance and anti-anxiety medications .
PROTEUS SYNDROME
Named after Proteus , the Greek god famous for changing his shape , this is a progressive disorder causing disfiguring tumours and abnormal bone development .
It 's extremely rare , with just over 100 cases confirmed since it was first identified in 1979 .
Its most celebrated victim was Joseph Merrick , aka " The Elephant Man " , a grotesquely deformed man befriended by Dr Frederick Treves , a physician at London Hospital .
At first , Merrick was believed to have suffered from the nerve disorder neurofibromatosis , but in 2003 DNA testing on his remains showed that he in fact had Proteus Syndrome .
His story inspired the 1980 film The Elephant Man , starring John Hurt as Merrick .
EMOTIONAL BLINDNESS
This one is included simply for light relief , as it is n't a rare illness so much as a universal phenomenon .
Emotional blindness occurs when people exposed to confronting images - violent or erotic - fail to register other stimuli for a short ( about one - fifth of a second ) but critical period thereafter - a hiatus that does n't occur after looking at more innocuous images .
This phenomenon , dubbed " emotional rubbernecking " by US researchers who reported it in The Psychonomic Bulletin and Review last August , could have evolutionary value .
From a survival point of view , it pays to focus more on things that signal physical danger or reproductive possibilities , while filtering out less emotionally charged input .
Emotional rubbernecking undoubtedly worked for cavemen , who never knew when the next sabre - tooth tiger ( or sexual partner ) might turn up .
Nowadays , given the capacity of sexy billboards to distract drivers from road conditions , for example , it 's more likely to be a health hazard .
The bill authorizes the projects but does not appropriate the money for them .
Appropriation of funds will have to be taken care of in subsequent legislation .
The veto of the water bill was the fifth cast by Mr. Bush , and the first to be overridden by Congress .
The president and some Republicans had complained that the bill was wasteful .
Some critics said that the measure did not do enough to reform the Army Corps of Engineers , which would handle much of the work ; that there is already a huge backlog of water - related projects waiting for money ; and that the current bill was larded with political pork .
But , as the comments of lawmakers made clear today , pork is in the eye of the beholder .
The bill “ is one of the few areas where we actually do something constructive , ” Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi , the Republican whip , told The Associated Press .
He said the bill contains “ good , deserved , justified projects . ”
Senator David Vitter , Republican of Louisiana , also argued in favor of overriding the veto .
“ This bill is enormously important , and it has been a long time coming , ” Mr. Vitter said .
Mr. Lott and Mr. Vitter side with President Bush far more often than they oppose him .
But both senators represent areas that were hard - hit by Hurricane Katrina , and their votes to override Mr. Bush ’s veto underscored the adage that politics is basically local , or at least regional .
It took only a few months to find out the Army was n't for me .
I was among a group of new guys that was integrated into a unit that had just gotten back from Iraq .
That meant hazing , and a lot of it !
Since we had n't been to Iraq , they had a free pass to do whatever they wanted .
They laughed and joked while we crawled down hallways with our faces dragging on the floor , grinding the dirt and dust that came off our boots .
I made it a point to stay in my room , even abstaining from using the bathroom .
It was from this treatment that the new guys formed a bond that we would carry throughout the years .
Some moved up in the ranks and became one of ' those guys , ' others could n't get past the paradoxical Army life .
To kill time during that first year , we would go out into a field and lay down white tape on the grass to simulate rooms of a building .
They would show us how to clear a room and then have us try .
Finishing up for the day , one of them said to me , " By the way , that is n't how we clear houses in Iraq , at all . "
" Then why do n't we train in the real way ? " I asked .
" Is n't this just a waste of time ? "
" Shut the fuck up . "
For those of us who could n't stop ourselves from asking the ever important " Why ? " , we counted the days until we fulfilled our obligation , resisting the calls to reenlist before , during and after our tour in Iraq .
Some fell for the not so subtle coercion and blackmail , sadly .
The rest banded together to wait it out .
Left to Right : Steve , Dozer and Me , Yakima 2005
Everyone has heard the saying that war is boring with short bursts of intensity .
Imagine how exciting it is to train for one !
Making two trips to eastern Washington , we would find out .
There were a few intense , realistic missions spread out among two weeks of freezing weather and sitting around .
Your tax dollars at work !
It was in these moments that made all the unbearable times a little easier to take .
Inside jokes were born .
Arguments and debates went on without end .
Friendships flourished .
We were together all the time in cramped quarters , getting to know each other better than our own friends and families back home .
Our speech patterns and slang words were interchangeable .
We 'd be going to Iraq as a family .
Before the loss of innocence : Kuwait 2006
More of those boring moments crept up throughout the deployment with a certain element of danger .
We 'd stay at an outpost for a couple days at a time away from decent bathrooms , internet and phones .
We 'd complain the whole time but managed to keep up the jokes and friendly arguments .
Chessboards would come out and crowds formed around heated matches .
Our platoon once drew a mission to escort some guys north of Mosul to an open desert .
They would be looking in abandoned bunkers for signs of WMDs and weapons material .
After a while we decided to get out and walk up a hill overlooking a village in the distance .
Realizing we were dozens of miles from anyone important , we took off our helmets .
Left to Right : Me , Dozer , Matt and Jesse
The rest of the deployment after Mosul was n't all fun and posing .
In Baghdad and Baqubah , our men lost limbs and minds .
Chevy was killed in March , and Jesse ( pictured above ) was killed in April by a sniper .
We spent days shoved into tiny rooms of the outposts we created , carrying on the friendships we had left .
On September 12 , 2007 , Bravo company returned to the states without two of our own .
The guys getting out by the end of November would start the process of paperwork and mandatory briefs .
As always , we did this together .
On November 30 , we would say our final goodbyes .
I spent three years , three months and twenty five days in the Army .
I saw the best and the worst of the men this country has to offer .
I have seen and experienced every extreme of the human condition .
I saw and did things I 'm proud of , and other things I would only tell the guys I was with .
Fifty years of life experience were crammed into 173 weeks .
I 'm often asked if I would ever do it again with the hindsight if I have now .
I would , only for the people I 've met .
The other parts of Army life made me leave .
I 'm just another vet now , full of memories and a shorter temper .
However you take the contents of this blog , I 'm satisfied with how my short career went down .
I just miss my friends , alive and dead .

A woman who slaughtered a pet goat at a Brisbane church in a Friday the 13th prank will be forced to apologise to the animal 's owners and the church community .
Tracey Lee Arnold , 26 , of Coorparoo , was today sentenced to two years ' probation for the slaughter of Maddie the pet goat at Bellbowrie Community Church , west of Brisbane , on October 13 last year .
She pleaded guilty in Brisbane Magistrates Court last month to three counts including stealing and injuring an animal , but the sentencing was adjourned until today to allow for a psychiatric report to be prepared .
Iraq 's Laboratory of Repression
The Bush administration is turning Iraq into a test tube for modern techniques of repression , from sophisticated biometrics that track populations to devastating weapons systems that combine night - vision optics from drone aircraft , heat resonance imaging and deadly firepower from the sky to kill suspected insurgents .

These high - tech capabilities , when mixed with loose rules of engagement that allow U.S. troops to kill Iraqis at the slightest sign of hostility , have contributed to what U.S. generals and a growing number of American journalists are hailing as an improving security situation .
Or , as President George W. Bush reportedly told Australia ’s deputy prime minister in September , “ We ’re kicking ass . ” U.S. forces have reported some success , too , in working with Iraqi paramilitary groups allied with Sunni sheiks , a strategy similar to operations used in El Salvador and Guatemala in the 1980s to eradicate leftist guerrillas and their political backers .
Amid these developments and the more favorable U.S. news coverage of the war , some neoconservatives are giddy at the prospect of claiming some measure of victory in Iraq , especially after years of facing hostility from Americans over the worsening carnage , including the deaths of more than 3,800 U.S. soldiers .
With renewed confidence , neocons are back to baiting Democratic war critics for failing to appreciate Bush ’s courage and foresight in dispatching more than 20,000 additional U.S. troops for a “ surge ” under Gen. David Petraeus .
“ Even as evidence has mounted that General Petraeus ' new counterinsurgency strategy is succeeding , Democrats have remained emotionally invested in a narrative of defeat and retreat in Iraq , reluctant to acknowledge the progress we are now achieving , ” said Sen .
Joe Lieberman , a neoconservative Independent from Connecticut , in a Nov. 8 speech .
Growing exhaustion with the war among Iraqis is viewed by Bush strategists as another positive indicator .
According to various estimates , the war has caused the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Iraqis and left some four million – roughly one in six – displaced .
Those numbers explain why many Iraqis are desperate for a restoration of some semblance of normal life , even if it is under a U.S. - led occupation that is nearing its fifth anniversary .
Happy Iraqis ?
While U.S. generals in Iraq have stressed the gentler aspects of their latest " surge " successes – and the American press has gone along by publishing front - page articles about new signs of normalcy in Baghdad – the darker side of the counterinsurgency has generally been shoved into brief stories deep inside the newspapers .
On Nov. 20 , for instance , the New York Times stressed the upside by leading the newspaper with photos of happy Iraqis in a feature article entitled , “ Baghdad Starts to Exhale as Security Improves . ”
If one reads the story to the jump , however , you find that the positive news was that some 20,000 Iraqis – or one - half of one percent of those four million displaced persons – had returned to their abandoned homes and had begun to get their lives back in order .
( Ironically , when the documentary “ Fahrenheit 9/11 ” showed similar footage of Iraqis enjoying normal lives in the days before Bush ’s “ shock and awe ” bombing in 2003 , director Michael Moore was denounced as a pro-Saddam propagandist .
The truth appears to be that even in difficult circumstances , people still get married and try to find some small pleasures . )
Clearly , too , the major U.S. news organizations remain under intense pressure to play up the positive aspects of the American occupation , much as they did during the early days when they broadcast footage of smiling Iraqi children waving at U.S. soldiers and touted how many schoolrooms had received fresh coats of paint .
[ For details , see our new book , Neck Deep . ]
The harsh repression surrounding the “ surge ” has drawn far less U.S. press attention .
The grim reality , however , is that an increasingly desperate American military has stepped up its indiscriminate killing and jailing of Iraqis , especially “ military - age males ” or MAMS .
A conservative counterinsurgency expert recently sent me a video , spliced together by the U.S. military in Iraq .
It showed night - vision aerial surveillance of suspected “ terrorists ” as they moved about at night with what was described as a truck - mounted anti-aircraft gun , the muzzle still warm from firing .
The tiny figures of the “ terrorists ” walked into a forested area where they were mowed down by miniguns from an AC - 130 .
Their truck also was blown to bits .
It ’s not clear , however , how the tiny figures were identified as “ terrorists , ” except that the term is applied loosely in Iraq , even against Iraqis who consider themselves nationalists resisting a foreign occupation of their homeland .
Other tidbits of troubling information – which often end up below the fold on the inside pages of newspapers – reveal how Iraq steadily has been transformed into a more efficient police state than dictator Saddam Hussein could have ever imagined .
For instance , the “ surge ” has involved widespread arrests of Iraqi MAMS , sweeps that detain thousands of young men on the flimsiest of suspicions .
During a summer 2007 trip to Iraq , Anthony Cordesman of the Center for Strategic and International Studies was briefed on U.S. plans to dramatically expand the number of Iraqis in American detention by the end of 2008 .
“ The detainees have risen to over 18,000 and are projected to hit 30,000 ( by the U.S. command ) by the end of the year and 50,000 by the end of 2008 , ” Cordesman wrote in his trip report , adding that the vast majority were Sunnis .
“ Shiite detainees are often freed while Sunnis are warehoused , ” he wrote .
When MAMS are detained , the U.S. military processes their biometric information , including retina scans , so a database can be built for tracking suspect Iraqis if they are subsequently released .
Americans rarely get a glimpse of this emerging police state , except when it gets a positive spin .
On Nov. 8 , for instance , reporters were invited to a crowded U.S. detention center at Camp Victory as nearly 500 of these Iraqis were released in a show of good will .
Some of the Iraqis complained that they had been pulled off the streets and were not allowed to contact their families .
“ I was detained in March 2007 for no reason , ” said one of the former prisoners , Tariq Jabbar , a 25 - year - old taxi driver from Zafaraniya , a neighborhood in southeast Baghdad .
[ NYT , Nov. 9 , 2007 ]
Other Iraqis have been even less lucky .
On Nov. 16 , a Sunni tribal group that had been cooperating with the U.S. military said American forces attacked and killed 50 of its members on the suspicion that they were insurgents .
The air and ground assault was launched on Nov. 13 near Taji , a town north of Baghdad .
After detecting “ hostile intent , ” helicopters and airplanes strafed buildings and ground troops fired on the Iraqis , the U.S. military said .
“ We had some people on the ground who identified these individuals as bad guys , basically , ” Lt. Justin Cole told the New York Times .
“ That ’s why we engaged . ” Sheik Jasim Zaidan Khalaf , who is part of the U.S. - backed Awakening Council , said some of his fighters had captured suspected members of Al Qaeda of Mesopotamia and were planning to turn them over to American forces when the attack occurred .
Frantic phone calls to the American military failed to stop the assault .
“ The whole issue started with a mistake , ” the sheik said .
[ NYT , Nov. 17 , 2007 ] Sniper Killings
Besides refusing to admit a mistake in the Taji attack , the U.S. military , in effect , has endorsed claims by members of elite Army sniper units that they have been granted broad discretion in killing any Iraqi who crosses the path of their rifle scopes .
On Nov. 8 , a U.S. military jury at Camp Liberty in Iraq acquitted the leader of an Army sniper team in the killings of three Iraqi men south of Baghdad during the early days of the “ surge . ”
Staff Sgt. Michael Hensley was found not guilty of murder , though he was convicted of planting an AK - 47 rifle on one of the dead men and showing disrespect to a superior officer .
In an e-mail interview with the New York Times , Hensley said he was angry with two superior officers who had encouraged him to boost the unit ’s kill count and then made him the “ fall guy . ”
Those rules of engagement apparently allow U.S. soldiers to kill suspected “ terrorists ” even if the targets are unarmed and not displaying hostile intent .
“ Every last man we killed was a confirmed terrorist , ” Hensley wrote .
“ We were praised when bad guys died .
We were upbraided when bad guys did not die . ”
[ NYT , Nov. 9 , 2007 ]
In other words , the evidence from these recent cases supports the suspicion that President Bush and the U.S. military high command have transformed elite units , such as Special Forces and expert sniper teams , into “ death squads ” with a license to kill unarmed targets who are believed to be “ bad guys . ”
Though this reality has been the subject of whispers within the U.S. intelligence community for several years , it surfaced into public view with two attempted prosecutions of American soldiers , including Hensley , whose defense attorneys responded by citing “ rules of engagement ” that permit the killing of suspected insurgents .
The case of Army sniper Jorge G. Sandoval Jr. , who served under Hensley , also revealed a classified program in which the Pentagon ’s Asymmetric Warfare Group encouraged U.S. military snipers in Iraq to drop “ bait ” – such as electrical cords and ammunition – and then shoot Iraqis who pick up the items , according to evidence in the Sandoval case .
[ Washington Post , Sept. 24 , 2007 ] ( Like Hensley , Sandoval was acquitted of murder but convicted of a lesser charge , the planting of copper wire on one of the slain Iraqis to make it look as if the dead man were involved in making explosive devices . )
Afghan Parallel
Another recent case of authorized murder of an insurgent suspect surfaced at a military court hearing at Fort Bragg , North Carolina , in mid-September .
Two U.S. Special Forces soldiers took part in the execution of an Afghani who was suspected of leading an insurgent group .
Though the Afghani , identified as Nawab Buntangyar , responded to questions and offered no resistance when encountered on Oct. 13 , 2006 , he was shot dead by Master Sgt.
Troy Anderson on orders from his superior officer , Capt .
Dave Staffel .
According to evidence at the Fort Bragg proceedings , an earlier Army investigation had cleared the two soldiers because they had been operating under “ rules of engagement ” that empowered them to kill individuals who have been designated “ enemy combatants , ” even if the targets were unarmed and presented no visible threat .
Yet , whatever the higher - ups approve as “ rules of engagement , ” the practice of murdering unarmed suspects remains a violation of the laws of war and – theoretically at least – would open up the offending country ’s chain of command to war - crimes charges .
The troubling picture is that the U.S. chain of command , presumably up to President Bush , has authorized “ rules of engagement ” that allow targeted killings – as well as other objectionable tactics including arbitrary arrests , “ enhanced interrogations , ” kidnappings of suspects in third countries with “ extraordinary renditions ” to countries that torture , secret CIA prisons , and “ reeducation camps ” for younger detainees .
The U.S. counterinsurgency and security operations in Iraq and Afghanistan also have been augmented by heavily armed mercenaries , such as the Blackwater “ security contractors ” who operate outside the law and were accused by Iraqi authorities of killing 17 Iraqi civilians in a shooting incident on Sept. 16 .
The use of lethal force against unarmed suspects and civilians has a notorious history in irregular warfare especially when an occupying army finds itself confronting an indigenous resistance in which guerrillas and their political supporters blend in with the local population .
In effect , Bush ’s “ global war on terror ” appears to have reestablished what was known during the Vietnam War as Operation Phoenix , a program that assassinated Vietcong cadre , including suspected communist political allies .
Bush ’s global strategy also has similarities to “ Operation Condor ” in which South American right - wing military regimes in the 1970s sent assassins on cross - border operations to eliminate “ subversives . ”
Despite quiet support for these Latin American “ death squads , ” the U.S. government presented itself , then as now , as the great defender of human rights , criticizing repressive countries that engaged in extrajudicial killings and arbitrary detentions .
That gap between American rhetoric and reality widened after 9/11 as Bush waged his “ war on terror , ” while continuing to impress the American news media with pretty words about his commitment to human rights – as occurred in his address to the United Nations on Sept. 25 .
Under Bush ’s remarkable double standards , he has taken the position that he can override both international law and the U.S. Constitution in deciding who gets basic human rights and who does n’t .
He sees himself as the final judge of whether people he deems “ bad guys ” should live or die , or face indefinite imprisonment and even torture .
Effective Immunity
While such actions by other leaders might provoke demands for an international war - crimes tribunal , there would appear to be no likelihood of that in this case since the offending nation is the United States .
Given its “ superpower ” status , the United States and its senior leadership are effectively beyond the reach of international law .
However , even if the Bush administration can expect de facto immunity from a war - crimes trial , the brutal tactics of the “ global war on terror ” – as well as in Iraq and Afghanistan – continue to alienate the Muslim world and undermine much of Bush ’s geopolitical strategy .
[ See Consortiumnews.com ’s “ Bush ’s Global Dirty War . ” ]
The ugly image of Americans killing unarmed Iraqis also helps explain the enduring hostility of Iraqis toward the presence of U.S. troops .
While the Bush administration has touted the improved security created by the “ surge ” of additional U.S. troops into Iraq , a survey of more than 2,000 Iraqis by the BBC , ABC News and the Japanese news agency , NHK , discovered mounting opposition to the U.S. occupation .
In August , 85 percent of those polled said they had little or no confidence in American and British occupation forces , up from 82 percent in February , when the “ surge ” began .
Only 18 percent said they thought the coalition forces had done a good job , down from 24 percent in February .
Forty - seven percent said occupying forces should leave now , up from 35 percent .
But a core question of the Iraq War always has been how hard the Iraqis would fight .
President Bush and the neocons initially got that question wrong in March 2003 when instead of a “ cake walk , ” U.S. troops encountered surprisingly stiff resistance and , even after taking Baghdad , faced a determined insurgency .
The neocons now believe the U.S. occupation has turned a corner , that rank - and - file Iraqis have suffered so severely that they are ready to accept the continued U.S. military occupation with declining resistance .
In the view of some influential neocons , this “ success ” in Iraq means it is now time for the United States to turn its attention to other troubled Muslim countries , such as Iran and Pakistan .
Two prominent “ think tank ” backers of the “ surge ” – Frederick Kagan and Michael O’Hanlon – were given space in the New York Times “ Week in Review ” section to propose a U.S. military intervention in Pakistan if unrest there spreads .
“ If we got a large number of troops into the country , what would they do ? ” Kagan and O’Hanlon asked .
“ If a holding operation in the nation ’s center was successful , we would probably then seek to establish order in the parts of Pakistan where extremists operate . ”
[ NYT , Nov. 18 , 2007 ]
Having tasted a measure of success in Iraq , the neocons now are raising their sights toward an even wider war in the Muslim world .

Michael Moore : 3500 troops could be alive if media had done its job David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Wednesday June 13 , 2007 Print This Email This Michael Moore appeared on ABC's Good Morning America Wednesday , expressing a concern that the media will play the same role in the health care debate as it did in the Iraq War debate .
" Had ABC News , NBC News , CBS News been more aggressive in confronting the government with what they were telling us back in 2003 about Iraq , you might have prevented this war , " Moore said .
" 3500 soldiers that are dead today may not have had to die had our news media done its job .
...
The media did n't ask the questions .
The media got embedded and went on board for a little thrill ride . "
" It 's not a thrill ride , " objected host Chris Cuomo .
" Those men and women put themselves in danger .
...
To say the media is complicit in the death of soldiers --"
" This media is complicit , " insisted Moore .
" The media did n't ask the questions that should have been asked . "
The segment then turned to Moore 's latest film , Sicko .
Moore argued that the US needs a single - payer health system like " every other Western industrialized country . "
However , he also said of the current presidential candidates that " these guys are bought and paid for by this industry , and that 's why we 're not going to have change . "
On Tuesday , RAW STORY reported on the first part of the two day interview with Moore , in which Moore asserted that the health care in America is a system that " essentially is run by greed . "
Moore also went on to defend his tactics in the film , including taking ailing 9/11 workers to Guantanamo Bay and Cuba for treatment .
Story and video can be found at this link .
The following video is from ABC's Good Morning America , broadcast on June 13 .
The bank has been hit by the sub - prime crisis
The US investment bank said that it had been forced to write down $ 9.4bn for the three months to 30 November .
The bank said last month that it would be taking a charge of $ 3.7bn .
Morgan Stanley said that the injection from China Investment Corp - which equates to 9.9 % of the bank - would help it to replenish its capital .
China 's willingness to invest in Morgan Stanley was seen as a vote of confidence on Wall Street and the firm 's shares rose 4 % in Wednesday trading .
But the heavy losses will increase pressure on chief executive John Mack , who described the performance as " deeply disappointing " and said he would not accept a bonus for 2007 .
The woes in the sector have already seen the firm 's highest ranked woman , Zoe Cruz , leave the firm .
Other banks have also been hit , and Merrill Lynch 's boss Stan O'Neal and Citigroup 's chief executive Charles Prince have both left their posts recently .
" Huge write - downs caused the ouster of Stan O'Neal and Charles Prince , " speculated Peter Cardillo , a market analyst at Avalon Partners .
" Maybe Morgan Stanley will follow them . "
Sovereign investment
Morgan Stanley , which saw a $ 1.2 bn write - down in the three months to the end of August , said that it still had about $ 1.8 bn - worth of exposure to sub - prime mortgages on its books .
Over the past few weeks , a string of global banks have indicated how much they have lost as a result of exposure to investment products linked to US sub - prime mortgages .
So far announced losses have totalled over $ 70bn , but the final toll might be much higher .
The losses have increased the pressure on boss John Mack
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) has predicted that losses will reach $ 300bn , and Goldman Sachs is forecasting $ 400bn .
Analysts said that while there was negative sentiment surrounding Morgan Stanley 's write downs , the investment from China was positive .
A number of other large investment banks have also received cash injections from sovereign wealth funds .
In October , Bear Stearns agreed to a $ 1bn investment from Citic Securities , which is controlled by China 's government .
Meanwhile , Citigroup sold a stake worth $ 7.5 bn to the Abu Dhabi government 's investment arm .
And earlier this month , UBS revealed that it had received a $ 9.7bn injection of funds from the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation .
Street - kids in New Delhi have created their own successful bank :
A related and less carefree spotting came in from New Delhi , India , where more than 1,000 street children have joined together to create a bank that helps them manage the small sums they earn each day .
Launched in 2001 by a volunteer aid group called Butterflies , the Children 's Development Bank aims to empower children in several important ways .
Like any other bank , CDB pays interest on the deposits that New Delhi 's street children make .
That interest can be a vital incentive to kids who might otherwise spend their daily earnings on cigarettes , candy or other items–or worse , have their meager profits stolen .
Money for the interest comes from the repayment of micro loans made to kids 15 years and older .
But interest on income is only part of the picture .
While adults stand at the ready to help , CDB is managed by children , helping them gain valuable work skills .

A dummy cosmonaut named " Ivan Ivanovich " ( the Russian equivalent of " John Doe " ) flew into space twice .
These test flights cleared the way for Yuri Gagarin 's first flight around the earth on 12 April 1961 .
To prevent any confusion by peasants who might recover Ivan and think he was a dead cosmonaut or an alien , a sign reading ' MAKET ' ( ' dummy ' in Russian ) was placed under his visor .
2 . Duct tape in space
NASA engineers and astronauts have used duct tape on many occasions in the course of their work , including in some emergency situations .
One such usage occurred in 1970 , when the square carbon dioxide filters from Apollo 13 's failed .
A workaround was made using duct tape , saving the astronauts lives .
In a 2001 NASA manual for spaceflight operations aboard the International Space Station , duct tape is even called for in case of " acute psychosis " during a space mission ; NASA procedures call for the use of duct tape to restrain the affected astronaut . [ 2 ]
3 . A pee for Gagarin
Yuri Gagarin , the first man in Space , took off from Baikonur .
Ever since , men about to leave the Earth from the Russian cosmodrome follow certain little rituals in memory of the Soviet hero .
For example , a few minutes before climbing into the launcher , they stop off for a quick pee , just as Gagarin did before his historic flight .
4 . The smell of Moon
All of the Apollo astronauts said moondust smell like burnt gunpowder .
Curiously , back on Earth , moondust has no smell .
There are hundreds of pounds of moondust at the Lunar Sample Lab in Houston , but it does n't smell like gunpowder .
Scientist believe that dusto lost its properties in the Earth and it just smell on the Moon .
5. Greatest distance from Earth
The Apollo 13 mission set a record for the greatest distance from Earth ever achieved by mankind .
This occurred because unlike the other Apollos , Apollo 13 did not make a burn behind the moon to drop into lunar orbit .
The free - return trajectory the mission followed took the spacecraft farther behind the moon than any other mission .
They were 400,171 km from Earth .
6. Space sandwich
In 1962 , astronaut John Young , as pilot of Gemini 3 , smuggled a corned beef sandwich onto the spacecraft , a feat for which he was reprimanded .
The controversy over the sandwich resulted in an investigation by NASA into what objects were carried aboard the spacecraft and why .
7. The Overview effect
On February 7th 1971 , astronaut Ed Mitchell was rocketing through space between the Earth and the Moon when something very odd happened ...
A feeling of bliss , timelessness , and connectedness began to overwhelm him .
He instantly and profoundly felt the understanding of his constituent atoms as having been born in the fires of ancient supernovas .
Well over 30 astronauts and cosmonauts have described a strange , nirvana - like phenomenon that can occur suddenly during space travel , which is collectively referred to as the “ Overview Effect ” , which has broadened their own understanding of our connection to space .
8 . The " Moon Trees "
Stuart Roosa orbited the Moon in Apollo 14 mission ( January , 1971 ) .
Packed in small containers in Roosa 's personal kit were hundreds of tree seeds , part of a joint NASA / USFS project .
Upon return to Earth , the seeds were germinated by the Forest Service .
Known as the " Moon Trees " , the resulting seedlings were planted throughout the United States and the world .
Believed locations of some Moon Trees are listed , but no list was ever kept nor any systematic tracking made of the disposition of all the trees .
9 . The fastest men ever
According to the 2001 Guinness World Records Apollo 10 has the record for the highest speed attained by a manned vehicle : 39,897 km/h ( 11.08 km /s or 24,791 mph ) .
The speed record was set during the return from the Moon on 26 May 1969 .
10 . A simulated Moon
A few years before the first landing of an Apollo crew on the moon , scientists recontoured a volcanic field just outside of Flagstaff , Arizona , with artificial impact craters resembling those found on Mare Tranquillitatis , the proposed first manned American landing site .
With high explosives , they terraformed a lunar surrogate right here on the surface of the earth .

Painesville --
More than 400 people crowded into the basement of St. Mary 's Catholic Church on the heels of a protest today against a weeklong sweep by immigration officials .
" We are scared , " Guadelope Gonzalez said as Mass was conducted upstairs .
" They can take me and send me back to Mexico .
We are good people .
We just come here to work . "
The crowd is on edge , fearful that immigration agents are still in Lake County , looking to arrest undocumented Hispanic people .
Not all of the people in the church are undocumented .
Some have family members who are undocumented .
They are trying to stay together .
They brought peanut butter sandwiches , oranges and Pepsi to the church , where they will stay until they are sure the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents are gone .
Local police say the agents left yesterday , after arresting 22 people in Painesville .
It 's unclear if others were arrested .
Hispanic activists at the protest this afternoon said up to 100 people were taken into custody and whisked out of the county .
Those arrested are not being held at local jails or Cleveland city jail , police officials said .
Three Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokesmen have not returned phone calls .
About 200 protestors gathered in front of City Hall at 2 p.m .
Most called the arrests inhumane .
Gonzalez , 36 , has a wife , a son and a daughter .
His son , a toddler , was born in Chicago .
He could stay in the United States , but I.C.E. could deport Gonzalez and his wife and daughter .
Gonzalez said he has been in the United States for 13 years .
Last year , an estimated 8,000 to 10,000 Mexican immigrants lived in Lake and Ashtabula counties .
Most work at the many nurseries in the area .
Revitalization Urbanism Transcends Partisanship By Ryan McGreal
Published November 15 , 2006
Raise the Hammer has made the point that we 're political but not partisan .
Our agenda , if you will , does not spring from this or that side of an ideological spectrum , but from our convictions about how the built environment shapes our lives .
If you must saddle RTH with an " ism " , then call us urbanists : we believe cities should be dynamic , diverse , vibrant , eclectic , attractive , and convivial , and that they should not consume or encroach blithely on their rural surroundings .
We also believe cities should be sustainable , and that they are ultimately governed by the first and second laws of thermodynamics .
Over the past century , humans have burned through a multi-million year endowment of stored energy ( in the form of fossil fuels ) .
This has allowed us to enjoy a living / working / transport arrangement that runs on a massive , one - time flow - through of cheap , abundant energy .
We 've built our cities over the past half - century as if this one - time endowment will last forever .
In so doing , we have incidentally invented a new built form that is neither urban ( fast , proximate , creative , and industrial ) nor rural ( slow , local , conservative , and manual ) , but an ersatz hybrid of the two : the sprawl suburb .
Sprawl is low - density but does not produce food .
It is industrial but does not generate ideas or produce goods .
It is ' conservative ' but does not conserve .
Destinations are separated but each destination is single - use ( unlike multi- functional farms ) , and vehicles are essential to get anywhere ( unlike dense city neighbourhoods ) .
The basic unit of sprawl is not the urban neighbourhood or the rural farmstead , but the single family house , which cannot produce any of the things it needs or process any of its own waste materials .
It is , therefore , an economic and cultural black hole , and it survives only because cheap , abundant energy allows its residents to move around in cars and obtain or dispose of all the things the house cannot manage itself .
This is a building form with no future .
The vast energy inputs needed to maintain sprawl suburbia are responsible for our ugly entanglements with oil producing countries and companies , our relentless empire - building in the Middle East , the growing crisis of climate change , and the steady increase in air pollution at home .
In the meantime , by replacing human energy with hydrocarbon energy , it robs us of opportunities to engage in the kind of productive work for which the human body has adapted over millions of years .
Overstuffed with manufactured , petroleum - based foods and denied the chance to work , our sedentary bodies fall prey to the chronic diseases of affluence : cancer , heart disease , type II diabetes .
The crisis of our living arrangement resists attempts to solve it through partisanship or political ideology .
It is not a product of capitalism or socialism , but the underlying hydrocarbon industrialism that made both ideologies possible in the 19th century .
Progressives should be concerned about sprawl .
The shape of sprawl suburbia makes any kind of community engagement - the foundation of progressive politics - extremely difficult to sustain .
Consider , for example , the number of neighbourhood and community associations in the lower city compared to those in the suburbs .
Sprawl forces children to grow up isolated , alienated , and utterly dependent on their parents to move around .
It consumes resources unsustainably and externalizes the waste it produces to others .
It is a fundamentally unfair living arrangement .
Conservatives should be concerned about sprawl .
It has all but destroyed the traditional forms of human settlement - the rural community and the urban neighbourhood - and is destroying the material and cultural foundation on which our society and economy are built .
Sprawl is a discontinuity , a dramatic break from patterns of civilization that go back millenia and an abrogation of the collective wisdom that once created viable communities through emergent processes .
As an attempt to liberate people from the problems of urban and rural life by wiping the slate clean , sprawl creates new problems without solving the old ones .
Libertarians should be concerned about sprawl .
It is made possible through massive government intervention : in opening rural lands , building the public infrastructure , subsidizing the price of fuel , undercharging property taxes , and forcing a false separation of uses and an arbitrary constraint on property owners ' rights through byzantine zoning regulations .
A robust urbanism can give people a tangible framework to transcent the false dichotomy of left / right , disorganize the unhealthy , self - perpetuating entanglements of partisanship , and get people thinking , talking , and working toward rebuilding communities that enrich our personal lives and sustain our public , shared environment .
I believe that 's a goal everyone can share .

Smoking pure marijuana is at least as harmful to lungs as smoking tobacco , a report from the British Lung Foundation concludes .
And in some key ways , it may be more dangerous .
For example , the BLF ’s review of previous research highlights that just three marijuana joints a day causes the same damage to the lung ’s airways as 20 cigarettes , mainly because of the way joints are smoked .
Individually , cannabis and tobacco produce the same constituents and quantities of chemicals known to be toxic to respiratory tissue , other than nicotine , the report says .
But when cannabis and tobacco are smoked together , the health effects are worse .
“ These statistics will come as a surprise to many people , especially those who choose to smoke cannabis rather than tobacco in the belief it is safer for them , ” says Mark Britton , chairman of the BLF .
A UK survey conducted earlier in 2002 found that 79 per cent of children believed cannabis to be ‘ safe ’ .

Deep breath
A key finding highlighted by the review of 90 published papers is that the amount of smoke taken into the lungs is two thirds larger if cannabis is being smoked .
The smoke is also taken one third deeper into the lungs – and that smoke is held an average of four times longer before being exhaled .
“ You inhale deeper and hold your breath with the smoke for longer before exhaling .
This results in more poisonous carbon monoxide and tar entering into the lungs , ” says Helena Shovelton , BLF ’s chief executive .
Other points in the report include :
 Tar from cannabis cigarettes contains up to 50 per cent higher concentrations of carcinogens benzathracenes and benzpyrenes than tobacco smoke
 THC , the primary psychoactive ingredient of cannabis , decreases the function of immune system cells that help protect the lungs from infection
 The average cannabis cigarette smoked in the 1960s contained about 10 milligrams of tetrahydrocanabinol ( THC ) , the primary psychoactive ingredient .
Today , it may contain 150 mg .
“ This means that the modern cannabis smoker may be exposed to greater doses of THC than in the 1960s or 1970s , ” says the report .
“ This in turn means that studies investigating the long - term effects of smoking cannabis have to be interpreted cautiously . ”
Mouth spray
Cannabis is the most widely consumed illegal drug in the UK .
In 2000 , almost 45 per cent of 16 to 29 year olds in the UK said they had used cannabis at some point .
“ We are not making any policy recommendations .
The aim of this report is to try to inform the public that if you do choose to smoke cannabis , be aware of the health risks , ” says a BLF spokeswoman .
Cannabis - based medicines could be prescribed for medical use in the UK as early as 2003 , following the recent success of final - stage trials .
But medicinal cannabis is supplied through a mouth spray or in tablet form .
“ We have always been keen to find additional ways of administering cannabis as a medicine , ” says Nina Booth - Clibborn of the UK ’s Medicinal Cannabis Research Foundation .
“ It did seem that smoking would not be the best way . ”
Lyndon Pugh , editor of pro-cannabis magazine CC Newz , is not impressed by the report : “ These allegations have been made before countless times .
Lot of things are dangerous , like driving . ”
A state news program , quoting unnamed " wealth management experts , " told residents with dollar accounts on the mainland to convert their holdings into yuan or a range of other foreign currencies , including the pound and the euro .
The prospect of ordinary Chinese ditching the dollar should be less alarming than reports that have roiled global markets of Beijing diversifying its official foreign exchange reserves .
Whereas China 's official reserves of more than $ 1.4 trillion are the world 's biggest , private foreign currency deposits in China are a fraction that size : $ 162.1 billion at the end of October , according to People 's Bank of China .
The central bank did not give a currency breakdown of these deposits .
Three Solutions to Dollar Weakness
The state news program , which did not quote any government official , said people were getting squeezed because the pace of yuan appreciation against the dollar was greater than the interest rate earned domestically on dollar accounts .
Analysts expect the yuan to rise anywhere from 5 to 7 percent annually against the dollar , while domestic dollar accounts earn depositors just 3 percent a year .
The program proposed three solutions .
" Selling dollar for yuan as soon as possible may be a safe approach , " the news program said , adding the yuan could then be used to invest in domestic mutual funds .
Report : Gore Nobel could increase chance of run RAW STORY
Published : Wednesday October 10 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This A Nobel peace prize victory -- which Al Gore has been tipped to win -- could boost the chances of a 2008 candidacy , according to a report in the UK Independent .
" Al Gore never quite closed the door on running for president again and his many loyalists are now pinning their hopes on Norway 's Nobel committee , in the belief that the prize must be his , this year of all years , " the Independent 's Leonard Doyle writes , adding that " people close to the former vice - president are convinced that he is looking for an opportunity to jump in the race . "
Gore spokesman Kalee Kreider , however , told RAW STORY today by email that the former vice president " has no intention of running for President in 2008 . "
" He is involved in a different type of campaign -- one to educate Americans and people around the world about the climate crisis , " she added .
As a candidate , Gore would certainly be well behind in fundraising , and many of the Democratic heavy - hitters who'd been holding their pursestrings saying they were awaiting a run have donated now to other candidates .
According to a recent report in the New York Times , those who said they were " waiting to see if Gore would enter the race " are pegged as " I just do n't want to contribute . "
Supporters now plan to place a full page ad in the Times .
" The supporters ' group has already gathered about 127,000 signatures this year  10,000 of them in the last week of September alone  and is planning to take out full - page advert in The New York Times as an open letter urging Mr Gore to run , " he says .
' We feel that if [ Mr Gore ] wins the Nobel Prize ... then he can't not run for president , ' Roy Gayhart , the man behind California 's Draft Gore group , told Newsweek . "
California Draft Gore , a grassroots political action committee , has hatched a plan to get their reluctant candidate off of theoretical fantasy polls and onto a real - life primary ballot .
Capitalizing on a provision of the state election law which allows for any name to be placed on a ballot provided enough signatures in favor of that candidate are secured , volunteers will begin scrambling next week to get 26,500 registered Democrats -- 500 from each of California 's 53 congressional districts -- to sign off on the former vice president before a Dec. 4 deadline .
If all goes well , Gore 's name will appear on ballots throughout the state when California 's presidential primary is held in February of next year .
" In 2003 , Gore asked us to stand down , " Gayhart pointed out , but after contacting the Gore camp with their plans this year , the initiative has received no such suggestion this time around .
" Everything he 's doing appears to be leaving open the possibility . "
In a May interview with Time , Gore did n't categorically deny he would consider a run , but did say he had " fallen out of love with politics , " and that he was n't " convinced the presidency is the highest and best role I could play . "

The House is set to vote Tuesday on the $ 500 billion 2008 Omnibus Appropriations Bill .
Unveiled on Sunday , the measure covers budgets for all cabinet department except the Pentagon .
Its expected to pass both houses of Congress this week .
Hidden in the bill is a major energy package that would boost government financing for the nuclear industry .
It would provide loan guarantees of up to $ 25 billion for new nuclear reactors .
A massive grassroots campaign forced these taxpayer - financed loans out of the national Energy Bill earlier this month .
But last week Republican Senator Pete Domenici of New Mexico slipped them back into the budget vote .
Harvey Wasserman has been at the forefront of raising awareness about the dangers of nuclear power .
He helped found the grassroots anti-nuke movement in the early 1970s and advises the Nuclear Information and Resource Service .

The Army Ranger who was alongside Pat Tillman when he was shot in Afghanistan told ESPN.com Friday that he remains convinced that the former NFL player was accidentally killed by friendly fire , rather than a target of a malicious act .
Sgt. Bryan O'Neal disputed Army doctors who , according to documents obtained by The Associated Press , voiced suspicions shortly after the 2004 incident about the close proximity of the three bullet holes in Tillman 's forehead and tried , initially without success , to get authorities to investigate whether the former NFL player 's death amounted to a crime .
The doctors , whose names were blacked out , said that the bullet holes were so close together that it appeared the former Arizona Cardinals safety was cut down by a weapon fired from a mere 10 yards or so away .
" No , there is no way the guy was 10 yards away .
That is just completely unlikely , " O'Neal told ESPN.com .
" If he was there initially , like the way the conspiracy theorists work that he was there to kill Pat , why would n't he have killed me ?
That does n't work so well . "
" There is no way that was the case [ that the Rangers were that close ] , " O'Neal said .
" You 'd be able to make out their face .
You 'd know exactly who was shooting .
Yeah , there is no possible way they were just 10 yards away . "
The medical examiners ' suspicions were contained in 2,300 pages of testimony released to the AP this week by the Defense Department in response to a Freedom of Information Act request .
Included in the documents was a statement from a doctor who examined Tillman 's body , telling Army investigators : " The medical evidence did not match up with the , with the scenario as described . "
The documents indicate the doctor said he took the unusual step of calling the Army 's Human Resources Command and was rebuffed .
He then asked an official at the Army 's Criminal Investigation Division if the CID would consider opening a criminal case .
Ultimately , the Pentagon did conduct a criminal investigation .
The Pentagon eventually ruled that Tillman 's death at the hands of his comrades was a friendly - fire accident .
Investigators also asked soldiers and commanders whether Tillman was disliked , whether anyone was jealous of his celebrity , or if he was considered arrogant .
They said Tillman was respected , admired and well - liked .
O'Neal , who was recently promoted to sergeant from specialist , told ESPN.com that he agreed with that assessment of the unit 's affection for Tillman .
" I 've heard some things why people would expect it -- Pat being against the war , against President Bush , something about him [ planning to speak ] with Noam Chomsky .
A lot of that stuff is new to me , so I could see why someone would think it is a conspiracy , " O'Neal explained .
" But I do n't think anyone would intentionally want to hurt him , unless we got a whole bunch of freakin ' actors in our platoon who pretended to adore the guy .
We all got along really well together until this happened .
And basically everyone turned on me . "
Tillman 's mother , Mary Tillman , who has long questioned whether her son was deliberately killed by his comrades , said she is still looking for answers and looks forward to the congressional hearings next week .
" Nothing is going to bring Pat back .
It 's about justice for Pat and justice for other soldiers .
The nation has been deceived , " she told AP .
According to the newly released documents , investigators pressed officers and soldiers on a question Mrs. Tillman has been asking all along .
" Have you , at any time since this incident occurred back on April 22 , 2004 , have you ever received any information even rumor that Cpl.
Tillman was killed by anybody within his own unit intentionally ? " an investigator asked then - Capt .
Richard Scott .
Scott , and others who were asked , said they were certain the shooting was accidental .
Among other information contained in the documents :
• In his last words moments before he was killed , Tillman snapped at O'Neal to shut up and stop " sniveling , " a characterization with which O'Neal disagrees .
• Army attorneys sent each other congratulatory e-mails for keeping criminal investigators at bay as the Army conducted an internal friendly - fire investigation that resulted in administrative , or non-criminal , punishments .
• The three - star general who kept the truth about Tillman 's death from his family and the public told investigators some 70 times that he had a bad memory and could n't recall details of his actions .
• No evidence at all of enemy fire was found at the scene  no one was hit by enemy fire , nor was any government equipment struck .
The Pentagon and the Bush administration have been criticized in recent months for lying about the circumstances of Tillman 's death .
The military initially told the public and the Tillman family that he had been killed by enemy fire .
Only weeks later did the Pentagon acknowledge he was gunned down by fellow Rangers .
With questions lingering about how high in the Bush administration the deception reached , Congress is preparing for yet another hearing next week .
The Pentagon is separately preparing a new round of punishments , including a stinging demotion of retired Lt. Gen. Philip R. Kensinger Jr. , 60 , according to military officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because the punishments under consideration have not been made public .
In more than four hours of questioning by the Pentagon inspector general 's office in December 2006 , Kensinger repeatedly contradicted other officers ' testimony , and sometimes his own .
At one point , he said : " You 've got me really scared about my brain right now .
I 'm really having a problem . "
The documents also shed new light on Tillman 's last moments .
It has been widely reported by the AP and others that O'Neal , who was at Tillman 's side as he was killed , told investigators that Tillman was waving his arms shouting " Cease fire , friendlies , I am Pat [ expletive ] Tillman , damn it ! " again and again .
But the latest documents give a different account from a chaplain who debriefed the entire unit days after Tillman was killed .
The chaplain said that O'Neal told him he was hugging the ground at Tillman 's side , " crying out to God , help us .
And Tillman says to him , ` Would you shut your [ expletive ] mouth ?
God 's not going to help you ; you need to do something for yourself , you sniveling ... "
O'Neal told ESPN.com his words did not match the chaplain 's recollection .
" The way he put it is wrong .
I would n't say it is entirely inaccurate , " he said .
" I just remember a point where I realized what was going on so I said a quick prayer -- help us get through this .
And Pat was like , ' Hey , praying is not really going to help you right now . '
So he kind of got me back to what was going on , so I was a little more situationally aware , " O'Neal said .
O'Neal said Saturday that he knew there were snipers in the
convoy that fired at them , but that he can't remember their names .
Were they fired at by the snipers ?
`` Not that I know of , '' O'Neal
told the AP .
O'Neal 's recollections of the snipers reflected testimony in the transcripts .
One exchange , for example , with Capt .
Richard Scott , who
conducted the first , immediate investigation , went only so far :
Q : Are you aware whether or not any U.S. forces snipers were at
the scene ?
A : Scott :
They were in serial two .
Q : And , and do you know whose GMV ( ground mobility vehicle ) they were traveling in ?
A : Scott : I do n't think they were in a GMV .
I think they were in
a cargo Humvee .
Q : Okay .
Do you know if the snipers fired any rounds during this
incident involving CPL Tillman ?
A : Scott : I do not , no .

“ The students are stinking because there is no water , ” Lieutenant Selah added .
A company spokeswoman , Erin Kuhlman , said that Parsons , which is based in Pasadena , Calif. , had strictly abided by the terms of the contract it had received from the United States Army Corps of Engineers to do the work at the academy .
“ Parsons completed its work at the Baghdad Police College in the spring of 2006 , ” Ms. Kuhlman said , adding that the Army Corps accepted the work as completed at about the same time .
By July 2006 , the company had been notified of problems with the plumbing .
Parsons put the Army Corps , in effect the company ’s client , in touch with the Iraqi subcontractors who actually carried out the construction , so that the Iraqis could fulfill their warranty to redress shortcomings in the work , Ms. Kuhlman said .

“ After we were notified by our customer of the issues , our customer worked directly with the subcontractor on the warranty work and Parsons has not been asked to provide any additional assistance on this project or with the warranty work , ” Ms. Kuhlman said .
But dire problems with the project were discovered in inspections in August and September 2006 by the Office of the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction , an independent agency led by Stuart W. Bowen Jr. His report on the inspections severely criticized not only Parsons but also the Army Corps for oversight that the report said was so weak as to be almost nonexistent in some respects .
Mr. Bowen ’s report also stated that inspectors had found “ indications of potential fraud ” in the project and had referred the case to its investigative division .

Things just went from " really bad " to " oh man that sucks " for Vonage .
The VoIP provider is requesting a permanent stay on Judge Claude Hilton 's decision in the Verizon patent suit , which decrees that Vonage can't sign up any new customers until it figures out a way to provide them service that does n't infringe upon Verizon 's patents .
Vonage had already been granted a temporary stay , saying that they 'd drum up a workaround , but this new request is much more pessimistic , saying that because Verizon 's patents are so broad , such technology would take months to develop , " if even feasible . "
The unlucky company is making a bit of a pity play as well , saying that even if it " was somehow able to implement a design around , and was able to ultimately prevail on appeal , it would have no hope of regaining its lost customers , or its lost goodwill , and its loss of revenue would be permanent and ... "
Oddly , the statement cuts out there , because the rest of it was redacted as " confidential material . "
The whole Vonage statement is in fact riddled with such holes , making it hard to figure out exactly what 's going on -- other than the fact that Vonage does n't like its chances of building a workaround .
No mention of that VoIP Inc. safety net either , but perhaps Vonage still thinks it has a shot at doing this the old fashioned way .
[ Via GigaOM ]
Update : Tier 1 research analyst Daniel Berninger points out that it 's actually possible that Verizon 's patents may be illegitimate .
Apparently the two patents in question , 6,104,711 ( filed March 6 , 1997 ) and 6,282,574 ( filed February 24 , 2000 ) may themselves use technology openly discussed and published by VocalTec back in 1996 .
In fact , it may also indirectly include technology input from the likes of IBM , Microsoft , Intel , Nortel , etc. made during the VoIP Forum in 1996 , with the businesses ' original intentions that this tech be used in future open standards .
Can anything be proved here that would give Vonage a get out of jail free card ?
Well , we 're certainly not lawyers ( we 'll defer to the legally - inclined in our audience ) , but already this patent he - said she - said is smacking a bit of RIM and NTP 's fracas , and we all know how ugly that wound up being for the BlackBerry maker .
Ann Coulter calls for Jews to be ' perfected ' by converting to Christianity Nick Juliano
Published : Thursday October 11 , 2007

Print This Email This Jewish group calls on media to boycott right wing author The National Jewish Democratic Council called for media organizations to stop inviting arch - conservative Ann Coulter to appear on television after the right wing pundit and author continued her habit of making outrageous , offensive comments on national television .
This time , Coulter said Jews should be " perfected " by accepting Jesus and America would be better off if everyone was a Christian .
A national Catholic organization also criticized Coulter 's remarks .
" I 'm just dumbfounded that a Christian would even say this in America , " Chris Korzen , executive director of Catholics United told RAW STORY .
Korzen said it was " particularly dangerous " to be mixing religious conversion with discussions of what it means to be an American , and he said Coulter 's comments reminded him of John McCain referring to the US as a " Christian nation . "
" I do n't believe I read anything in the constitution about Jesus Christ dying for our sins , " Korzen said .
Others called for television networks to ban Coulter from the airwaves .
 While Ann Coulter has freedom of speech , news outlets should exercise their freedom to use better judgment ,  NJDC Executive Director Ira N. Forman said in a press release .
 Just as media outlets dont invite those who believe that Martians walk the earth to frequently comment on science stories , its time they stop inviting Ann Coulter to comment on politics .
Media Matters also criticized Coulter , one of the group 's favorite targets .
Coulter 's comments came during Monday 's episode of CNBC's The Big Idea , but received little notice until Media Matters ' report Wednesday and the NJDC 's criticism Thursday .
Host Donny Deutsch asked Coulter what her ideal picture of America looked like and she recalled the 2004 Republican convention in New York City .
" People were happy .
They 're Christian .
They 're tolerant .
They defend America , " she said .
Deutsch asked , " It would be better if we were all Christian ? "
Coulter replied " yes , " and reitereated her declaration again later in the interview , although she denied wanting to wipe all Jews off the map .
" We just want Jews to be perfected , as they say , " Coulter said .
Deutsch , a practicing Jew , said he was personally offended by Coulter 's remark , and she tried to defend herself .
" I do n't want you being offended by this .
This is what Christians consider themselves , because our testament is the continuation of your testament .
You know that .
So we think Jews go to heaven .
I mean , [ Rev. Jerry ]
Falwell himself said that , but you have to follow laws .
Ours is ' Christ died for our sins , ' " Coulter said .
" We consider ourselves perfected Christians .
For me to say that for you to become a Christian is to become a perfected Christian is not offensive at all . "
Another Catholic group blasted Coulter 's remarks , saying they " show profound ignorance of both religion and American history . "
" Ms. Coulter embarrasses Christians with her arrogance and insensitivity , " Alexia Kelley , Executive Director , Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good , said in an e-mail to RAW STORY .
" And ( she ) does not speak for those Christians and Jews who struggle together every day for justice and the common good . "
Reaction to Coulter 's comments was mixed online , with the US correspondent for Israeli daily Haretz cataloguing all the possible responses to Coulter 's latest tirade .
In what he calls one of the " silly parts of blogging , " Shmuel Rosner gives a range of reactions from , " This is anti-Semitism ; pure and simple , " to " She only said that for a Christian it is okay to hope for everybody else to be a Christian .
What 's wrong with that ? " to " Ann Coulter ?
Who 's Ann Coulter ? "
Federal efforts to tighten the border and deport illegal immigrants are so far insufficient to satisfy states and localities , which are proposing and passing laws at record rates to take matters into their own hands .
With a proposal for comprehensive immigration reform now stalled in the US Senate , and its prospects for revival uncertain , the wave of immigration - related measures outside Washington is only likely to grow , as state and local governments balk at shouldering the economic , law - enforcement , and social costs they attribute to illegal immigrants .
Through mid-April , legislators in all 50 states had introduced a record 1,169 bills dealing with illegal immigrants – more than twice the number put forward in all of 2006 .
Eighteen states had enacted 57 of those bills as of April 19 , two - thirds of the number of immigration laws adopted by states last year , according to a report by the National Conference of State Legislatures ( NCSL ) in Washington .
" I would not be surprised to see an increase above this year 's historic level [ of state legislation ] if there 's no [ federal ] reform , " says Sheri Steisel , an immigration policy expert at NCSL .
" Clearly , in areas of employer documentation , education , and healthcare we 'll see even more activity next year . "
Cities take action , too
Cities , counties , and towns are grappling with illegal immigration as well .
" More than 90 cities or counties have proposed , passed , or rejected laws prohibiting landlords from leasing to illegal immigrants , penalizing businesses that employ undocumented workers , or training local police to enforce federal immigration laws , " said Dennis Zine , a board member of the National League of Cities and the chair of its Immigration Task Force , in testimony before a US House Judiciary subcommittee in May .
Local governments , he said , have no control over the flow of immigration but are responsible for integrating immigrants into their communities .
" While immigrants have strengthened our country and our communities in innumerable ways , " Mr. Zine testified , " many communities are straining to find the right approach in such an unsettled environment over immigration and federal immigration policy . "
The state and local bills run the gamut of immigration - related issues , though most are intended to make life more uncomfortable for people in the United States illegally .
They also raise some thorny issues for politicians wanting to take action .
For instance , if Arizona decides to sanction employers in the state for hiring undocumented workers , will the companies targeted move to a state that does n't have such an enforcement regimen ?
Such a bill has already cleared Arizona 's House of Representatives and is now being debated in the state Senate .
Moreover , voters here in November approved four ballot initiatives targeting illegal immigrants .
One denies in - state tuition rates to undocumented college students .
By April , 40 other states had introduced 199 bills related to employment of undocumented workers – the top subject of concern in the states .
The next is law enforcement , then benefits and , closely behind , education , according to the NCSL .
Stresses in new places
Though the US is a nation of immigrants , and the percentage of new immigrants today may actually be lower than in the late 19th century and early 20th century , the patterns have changed .
" Immigrants are going to places like Hazelton , Pa. , or towns in Georgia , Alabama , and Mississippi where the economies are doing better , " says Joe Vail , director of the Immigration Law Clinic at the University of Houston .
While these communities have plenty of jobs , they do n't have the classrooms and other services to support these immigrants and their families .
The costs of education , medical care , and other social services are creating financial burdens on them that are n't reimbursed by the federal government , says Professor Vail .
The NCSL's Ms. Steisel says immigration issues now affect all 50 states .
As recently as 10 years ago , she says , only five states – New York , Texas , Florida , Illinois , and California – were dealing with serious immigration problems .
She cites North Carolina as an example .
The 2000 census showed that the state had recorded a 400 percent increase in foreign - born residents .
" That is an extraordinary number , " Steisel says .
" What you see now is states that never before had to deal with immigrants now have to figure out how to handle questions as complex as human trafficking , what documents are necessary for employment – a wide set of issues . "
Pitfalls of state and local laws
But when states and municipalities tackle these issues , problems can arise .
For example , the federal government already requires employers to verify workers ' documents , through the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 ( IRCA ) .
When local governments take that responsibility on themselves , it only clogs up the system , experts say .
Moreover , putting the onus on landlords to verify a potential tenant 's immigration status could cause major problems with monitoring and enforcement , and may lead to discrimination if landlords prove to be unwilling to bear the costs of defending their judgments .
" If a municipality or state has such landlord sanctions in place , we could see discriminatory standards in housing , " says Rodolfo Espino , a political scientist at Arizona State University ( ASU ) .
That 's what happened in the workplace , he says .
" After IRCA , Asians and Hispanics were discriminated against because employers did n't want to take the risk that the paperwork they accepted may be challenged . "
Employers chose instead to hire whites , leading to a number of discrimination cases Dr. Espino says .
" The spillover effects could be very disastrous . "
Pleas for federal action
The pitfalls of immigration law are leading some state and local politicians to plead with the federal government to act .
" I implore lawmakers to go back to the table , iron out their differences , and give us an immigration system that is enforceable , and the resources to enforce it , " Arizona Gov. Janet Napolitano wrote in an op -ed that appeared Monday in The Washington Post .
" If there is a solution [ to illegal immigration ] , it would have to come at the federal level , " says David Berman , professor emeritus of political science at ASU .
" The problem is national and international in nature , something that would be difficult to handle on a state - by - state basis . "
The quality of enquiry , or quirth , is one that has largely evaporated from American life , like the water set to boil in a pot of frogs intended to demonstrate that frogs do n't know they 're being boiled if you raise the temperature slowly enough .
Vestiges of that spirit ( of enquiry , not frog boiling ) endure , but they have become almost nonsensical : take Missouri 's motto " The Show Me State " , for example , which is not the condition of latent homosexual voyeurism it seems to describe , rampant among Republican senators in public lavatories ; rather it is an expression of skepticism .
Show me proof , and then we can talk .
Not a bad sentiment .
Unfortunately one no longer found in most quarters of the United States .
This may come from the explosion of information to which we are subjected , in the form of advertising and storytelling ( or the amalgamation of both , in the case of televised programming ) .
500 channels , we are promised .
500 channels of what ?
We now have an acronym for it , TMI , which stands for either " Too Much Information " or " Trombone Meat Infringement " if you prefer acronyms made up of random words .
It is hard to formulate sensible questions when a million answers have been thrust upon one before the first question had a chance to get out .
Some years ago , the nuclear energy industry in put out a preemptive " educational campaign " to allay fears expressed by the millions of Americans that lived alongside the railway routes by which said industry had decided to move nuclear waste .
The industry patiently and unrelentingly answered all question about the safety of this program by saying , " this spent fuel " ( they call it " spent fuel " because " nuclear waste " sounds , oh , you know , so negative ) " this spent fuel cannot , and will not , explode . "
But can it get into the air or the groundwater ?
It will not explode .
Can it be flung by that commonplace railway accident , the impact of two trains , out of its containers and into the sorts of places a fellow is likely to come in contact with it ?
Is not a single flesh - rotting molecule of the stuff an absolute guarantee of death ?
Hush , little commoners .
It will not , cannot explode .
You know what ?
I have no idea if they 're shipping spent doomfuel around on trains these days ,
There were too many other things going on around then , and the subject just got swallowed up along with the fate of Joanie Loves Chachi or Twin Peaks or whether Boy George could stay off heroin -- I do n't even remember what the distraction de jour was .
I suppose they do ship the stuff by train ; the old system with donkeys was hopelessly outmoded even then .
The point is that I have n't even thought about it , me who prides himself on quirth in abundance .
Jesus , I can't even remember what I was going to ask my fiancÃ©e when I go downstairs with an unmatched sock and a necktie in my hand .
It 's too much to imagine I 'm also going to remember to ask what 's happening to the nuclear waste , let alone demand an answer to whatever I asked last time .
But is the only problem that we Americans suffer from Trombone Meat Infringement ?
I think there 's something else , as expressed in a motto ginned up by the Clinton people : " Do n't ask , do n't tell " .
If ever there was a rubbishy catchphrase dredged up from the large intestine of a Madison Avenue disinformation factory , this is it .
Are you gay ?
Do n't ask , Sergeant .
And Private Danglers , whatever you 're thinking in those lathery showers , think away , but do n't tell .
Let 's all pretend the issue is n't even there .
Homophobia is one of the most pervasive and pointless problems facing us today : if a certain congressional poofter that recently made headlines with his clumsy solicitations to an undercover policemen had merely been able to say , " gold dang , I 'm as queer as bull tits " , he might still have a career .
Instead , he was forced to make an elaborate defense of his solicitations by describing in nauseating detail every peculiarity of his seated bathroom habits ( TMI ) in an attempt to answer the explicit police report filed by the officer to whom he made the advances ( whose name has not been released to the press , but apparently he goes by the moniker " Swingin ' Hammer " ) .
What I mean to say is Americans now expect to find something horrible under every Rock Hudson .
[ Note to editor : remove previous cheap gag and replace with simple word " rock " ] .
Ask the most innocuous question , like " when we inevitably do leave Iraq , what is our plan for doing so ? " and the hideous truth flashes out like the fangs of a hideous truth : there is no plan .
This all began when someone said , " is that pop combo Milli Vanilli really singing ? "
It 's been downhill since then .
Ask any question regarding the American Gertztramufiner ( ' sup , yo ' ) and if an answer is forthcoming , it will certainly be what you least want to hear .
One finds oneself not asking .
Then of course there 's the explosion of faith - based thinking .
We have started to think Word is better than word .
The abstract authority of the preacher or the evangelist president , the simple demand that they be trusted , believed , is deadly to any spirit of free thinking , of doubt , and even the ability to absorb basic information that does n't quite line up with what the Daddy Figure is telling you .
You add that to the endless streams of falsehoods and fudging in which every American is bathed today , you got yourself a nation of dupes .
So have we seen the end of the American tradition of self - reliant doubt ?
Will we , as a nation , ever work up the gumption to question the word of the ' expert ' , the ' authority ' , the ' talking head ' out loud , even if we secretly lack any faith that we 're being told the truth ?
It appears , I regret to say , that we 're in for a further spell of incuriosity .
Maybe it started with the Reaganite anti-intellectual vogue , or earlier , when Joe McCarthy turned inquiry into inquisition .
It could be the decline of such subjects as rhetoric , or the decline of schooling in general .
Maybe it was Trivial Pursuit .
I ( by which I mean me , or the guy most people think is me , because who can ever really know anybody ? ) hope we can restart that useful skepticism that helped us rebuff the blandishments of kings and courtiers .
There are signs this is happening .
Only a handful of truly damaged individuals still believe what the government is telling them any more .
A lot of people are profoundly discouraged by the energy wasted on the fad for 9/11 conspiracy theories , replete with invisible airplanes , missiles disguised as jumbo jets , and a host of demolitions experts coordinated by a White House that could n't organize a birthday party if the kid brought his own cake .
This line of questioning may be misguided , but at least it 's questioning , and I 'm glad the doubt is there .
Building seven : why did it drop ?
I do n't know , but Bush sure as hell was n't behind it .
He could n't drop his own pants .
The Iran war is going to be a much harder sell than Iraq was , for an example of progress .
You can already see the White House people getting out of breath just trying to keep the media drumbeat going , regardless of how compliant the reporting is .
There are a million other distractions , for one thing ; for the neocons it 's like trying to write a best - selling novel while being eaten alive by locusts .
It 's not the media asking the questions , it 's the American public .
This is encouraging .
If we imagine Wolf Blitzer or that most closeted of closeteers , Anderson Cooper , is going to pitch anything but the slowest of softballs to the evil sods destroying this and other nations , our imaginations have up and quit on us .
But ordinary people , meaning consumers , consumers , and voters , in that order , are asking tougher questions .
They 're taking less on faith .
They 're starting to experience the thrill of quirth , that feeling of not believing an unproven answer , of not letting someone else ask the wrong question and trying to pretend the answer will suffice .
Will it turn into a change in the national character ?
I do n't know .
Disco was just a fad , thank fuck , and probably the intense Evangelical frenzy gripping certain segments of the population will wear off once old - time religion turns out to be of less utility than Disco .
One can hope .
I 'll take a slight decrease in the level of bovine credulity .
Hey , Nancy , why are you really so determined not to oppose Bush ?
First ask the question , then question the answer , and at last you 'll have a better idea of what the real question is .
For me , it 's enough that I remembered why I was boiling a pan of frogs on the stove .

Lenovo is the world 's third - biggest PC maker
Linux is a free , open source operating system developed as an alternative to systems such as Microsoft 's Windows .
Novell will provide the Linux software on the laptops , which are due to go on sale at the end of the year .
Earlier this year PC maker Dell also announced it would start shipping PCs with the Linux OS installed .
Lenovo announced its plans at the start of LinuxWorld , an annual conference held in San Francisco .
Dell introduced Linux - powered PCs after chief executive Michael Dell asked customers for suggestions for new products on the company 's website : Linux PCs were the most - requested item .
Linux was first released to the public almost 16 years ago and was developed by Linus Torvalds , who wanted to create a non-commercial alternative to an operating system used in many universities .
Linux can be freely distributed , modified and used by anyone who wants it .
It is predominantly used to power web servers and while its growth on desktop computers has been limited to technology specialists , its adoption by Lenovo and Dell points to wider acceptance .
Analysts believe that approximately 6 % of computers users run Linux , similar to the numbers choosing Apple Macs .
How To Hire Freelancers
The freelancer culture is thriving – and the best thing about it is that you get to pick from the best of the talent pool !
Freelancers take their job seriously and do it professionally as any regular employee would do .
But again , all are n’t the same !
So when you ’re hiring freelancers , what should you look out for ?
Here ’s a list :
The Nikkei 225 Average shed more than 2 percent to hit a 15 - month closing low , as Honda Motor and other Japanese exporters fell after the yen 's sharp rise against the dollar and losses on Wall Street .
South Korea 's KOSPI fell 3.37 percent to a three - week closing low , suffering its biggest daily percentage drop in three months , as fears over a U.S. economic recession hit exporters such as LG Electronics .
Australian shares fell 1.4 percent to a seven - week closing low as resource firms such as BHP Billiton fell on weaker oil and base metal prices , while persistent credit concerns weighed down on major banks .
But global miner Rio Tinto extended its rally , hitting a fresh record during the session , on speculation that suitor BHP will have to lift its $ 140 billion bid , while Computershare gained on an earnings upgrade .
Hong Kong 's Hang Seng
Index tumbled nearly 4 percent , as investors fretted about Wall Street 's three - day losing streak and more losses related to the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis .
HSBC Holdings dropped over 3 percent , after a report that the global lender is expected to unveil further losses this week from its exposure to U.S. mortgages .
Singapore 's Straits Times
Index extended the morning 's losses , dropping in line with falls in regional markets after Wall Street tumbled on Friday .
Banks were leading the declines with DBS Group , United Overseas Bank , and Oversea - Chinese Banking Corp all sharply lower .
China 's Shanghai Composite
Index closed more than 2 percent lower after the central bank announced at the weekend that it would raise the ratio of bank reserve requirements , effective
from Nov. 26 , in its latest monetary tightening .
Worries about tightening monetary policy , sky - high stock valuations and heavy supply of new shares from public offers have undermined a bull run that had more than doubled the main index since the start of this year to last month 's record high .
Extreme weather events are likely to become more frequent
A report by a coalition of environment and aid agencies calls for urgent action to avert the threat .
The Working Group on Climate Change and Development says industrialised countries must cut carbon emissions massively by mid-century .
The coalition calls on the UK government to set an example by championing renewable energy .
The report - Up In Smoke ?
Asia and the Pacific - says Asia is " effectively on the front line of climate change " , as it is home to almost two - thirds of the world 's population .
Asia 's vulnerable will continue to suffer , as will communities worldwide , who are contributing least to climate change
Nazmul Chowdhury , Disappearing Lands project
The report says Asia is where the " human drama of climate change " will largely be played out .
The report 's author , Andrew Simms of the New Economics Foundation ( Nef ) , said : " If those painfully won improvements in social and economic conditions can be blown away in a few but increasingly frequent and extreme weather events , we have to rethink about how we go about meeting people 's basic needs . "
The coalition 's 21 members include ActionAid International , Christian Aid , Friends of the Earth , Greenpeace , Oxfam and WWF .
Nef , together with the International Institute for Environment and Development , organised the report 's production .
The coalition previously published a study in October 2004 saying global warming threatened poverty reduction and urged industrial countries to cut their carbon emissions dramatically .
It said such action now was " even more pressing " .
UN talks
The report comes as world leaders prepare for UN climate change talks in Bali next month .
Nazmul Chowdhury , from the Disappearing Lands project , says : " Before the Bali meeting , we must make our voices heard , and demand international leaders take urgent and ambitious action .
We need to start talking about emissions reduction targets that are in line with the science rather than in line with what negotiators think they can get away with
Andrew Simms , Nef
Andrew Simms said he hoped the talks would help bring a " paradigm shift in the attitude of developing countries " .
" We need to start talking about emissions reduction targets that are in line with the science rather than in line with what negotiators think they can get away with , " he told BBC News .
As well as cutting global emissions by at least 80 % by 2050 , the report calls on richer countries to lead by example and champion renewable energy .
The coalition says Asian countries need to be convinced not to go down the fossil fuel energy route of " get rich quick , stay poor long " .
Mr Simms said : " Practical difficulties and a lack of rich country leadership on climate change mean Asia is unlikely to abandon fossil fuels in the near future . "
He added : " It is useless to turn around and point a finger at China 's rising emissions if we are not showing the will and making the resources available to provide the changes necessary . "
SAN FRANCISCO — Max Levchin is not easily distracted from his work .
A few years ago , Mr. Levchin , one of the young princes of Silicon Valley , bought his first home , a 12 - room Edwardian high atop a hill here , for $ 3.4 million .
But Mr. Levchin , who made a fortune at age 27 selling PayPal , the online payment service he helped start in 1998 , never moved in .
He sold it two years later without having slept there for even one night .
Since then , Mr. Levchin has moved into his second home , a more expensive one found for him by Nellie Minkova , his girlfriend of eight years who has become his fiancée .
But so consumed is he by work on his second company , an Internet start - up focused on sharing photos and videos , that the cartons that contain what Mr. Levchin described as “ 85 percent of my worldly possessions ” are still stacked in his living room , five months after moving day .
Mr. Levchin , who is now 32 , is typical of a new generation of junior titans in Silicon Valley who might be called the prematurely rich — techies worth tens of millions of dollars , sometimes more , at an age when many others are just starting to figure out what to do with their lives .
The Internet , a low - overhead medium with a global reach , has greatly accelerated the wealth creation phenomenon , producing a larger breed of multimillionaires even younger and richer than in the past .

BLITZER : But you could in the House of Representatives use your power of the purse , the money , to stop funding the war if you really wanted to .
PELOSI : I wish the speaker had all the power you just describe .
I certainly could do that .
That does n't bar the minority from bringing up a funding resolution .
They have their parliamentary prerogative as well .
Um .... what 's so bad about letting the Republican MINORITY propose a funding bill ?
And then voting it down with your MAJORITY in the House ?
Her lofty goals now ?
Holding Bush accountable and explaining that it is not her fault .
BLITZER : So , are you telling your angry base out there in the Democratic Party that wants to see this war over with , wants to see the U.S. troops home , that you , as speaker , there 's nothing you can do , you have to just throw your hands up and say ...
PELOSI : No .
I did n't say that at all .
BLITZER : ... given the legislative problems in the Senate and the president 's stubborn refusal to back down , that there 's nothing that you can do ?
PELOSI : How could you have ever gotten that impression ?
BLITZER : All right , well , tell us ...
PELOSI : What I have said , for those who pay attention , is that we will hold this administration accountable time and time again for the conduct of this war in Iraq .
She does NOT say that the House Democrats under her Speakership will continue to try to end the war .
She says that they will hold Bush ' accountable . '
How will they hold him accountable ?
Not through Impeachment .
Impeachment is off the table , this is Bush 's War , Cheneys War , the Republican War
She says there is a choice ....
So we 're talking about a greatly diminished force there and a redeployment that 's safe and responsible within the next year .
The president is talking about 10 years and then after that , a Korea - like presence in perpetuity .
That 's the choice .
Speaker Pelosi , by not attempting defunding you have just MADE that choice for all of America .
YOU have taken OUR choice away , not because you have been forced too , but because you have CHOSEN to give up without doing all you can with the power at your disposal .
The choice is this Speaker Pelosi :
You can do EVERYTHING you can to end this war and TRULY hold Bush accountable .... or you can throw in the towel .
You can tell Bush and America that YOU will not continue the war .... by not funding it .
You can do EVERYTHING you can to hold Bush accountable for lying us into war ..... by Impeaching him and Cheney .
Or you can throw in the towel .
Apparently you have made your choice .
Our only choice now is to try to shame you into doing your job .
Watch the video , read the transcript , check andgarden 's diary on Rahm .
The Dems have given up .
Opposing Bush is now off the table .
Can we Yell Loud enough to put it back on ?
Or should we just accept years and years of more war ?
Pakistani President Gen. Pervez Musharraf is now teetering on the edge of the abyss , just as I predicted in the spring of 2007 .
He was pushed there by U.S. policy , and worse yet , his country is armed with nukes .
To prevent the Pakistani Supreme Court from declaring him ineligible to serve another term as president , a role he won last month in dubious elections , the autocratic Musharraf has declared martial law and ousted the Supreme Court ’s chief justice .
Although President George W. Bush has asked Musharraf to set an end date for the state of emergency , hold elections , and give up his powerful position as head of the armed forces , Bush has continued U.S. aid and recently described Musharraf as an ally America needs in order to fight al - Qaeda .
These signs of continued U.S. support have emboldened the spent Musharraf regime .
Although Musharraf has set parliamentary elections for January 2008 , they will hardly be fair , unless martial law is lifted prior to the plebiscite .
Meanwhile , the Pakistani population smolders with anger against the unpopular dictator , and in Pakistan ’s northwest , Islamic militants are ascendant .
How did the Bush administration help create this mess ?
It all started in 2002 .
The Bush administration decided U.S. forces should stay and occupy Afghanistan after their successful invasion to oust the radical Islamist Taliban movement from power .
Meddling in and occupation of Muslim lands by non-Muslims is what drives Islamists to violent acts  guerrilla warfare and terrorism .
For example , American support for the corrupt Saudi Arabian regime , and U.S. military presence in holiest lands of Islam , led Osama bin Laden to launch his terrorist campaign against the United States .
Similarly , continued U.S. and Western occupation of Afghanistan and the failed attempt to eradicate opium , the primary crop of the poor Afghan people , have led to Afghan disillusionment with the West and increased support for a resurgent Taliban movement .
That ’s where Pakistan comes in .
The Pakistani intelligence services , in order to dominate Afghanistan , supported the Taliban in its original quest for power , then during its despotic rule .
Although Musharraf , under intense pressure to switch sides after 9/11 , rhetorically supported the U.S. “ war on terror ” and pocketed $ 10 billion in American aid , he needed the support of those same Islamists to survive in power .
Thus , he never made a real effort to capture or kill Osama bin Laden , suspected to be hiding in northwest Pakistan .
On the contrary , he pledged not to attack the Islamists in that area .
Meanwhile , as with the U.S. occupation of Afghanistan , U.S. backing and military assistance to the Musharraf government has fueled an Islamic resurgence in Pakistan , too .
Now it is within the realm of possibility to have a repeat of the 1978 situation in the shah ’s Iran .
The population could become so enraged at a brutal dictator supported by the United States that eventually a hostile radical Islamist government could take power .
But this time , in Pakistan , it would be a regime with nuclear weapons  in short , an Islamic bomb .
So the Bush administration may yet hand us the worst of all worlds : bin Laden and company still on the loose and again guarded by an Islamist regime , this time with nuclear weapons .
The Bush administration has continually exacerbated the threat of radical Islamism by refusing to see that U.S. meddling in Islamic nations is fueling the problem .
Overt U.S. occupation of Afghanistan and support for Afghan President Hamid Karzai , along with U.S. backing and aid to Musharraf in Pakistan , have inflamed the entire region .
So after 9/11 , what would have been a better U.S. policy ?
After the destruction of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan , the United States should have called a conclave of all Afghan groups and stated that Afghan governance was the business of Afghans ; but if any Afghan government gave anti-U.S. terrorists sanctuary , the U.S. military would return with a vengeance .
If the U.S. had employed such a policy , the Taliban likely would not be resurgent today .
As for Pakistan , for an entire year after 9/11 , Musharraf quietly gave the United States free reign to nab bin Laden .
But instead of using its covert forces quietly to take full advantage of this offer , the U.S. provided ostentatious diplomatic support and military aid , turning Pakistan  in the eyes of the Islamists  into an American puppet .
The first step toward a smarter policy in the region is to recognize that the United States is part of the problem .
In Afghanistan , the United States still could do what it should have done after 9/11 ; withdrawing its forces would extinguish the fire of the Taliban resurgence .
In Pakistan , Musharraf is likely to fall , but such a close U.S. hug for him makes it more likely that Islamists could eventually win power .
So the U.S. should use Musharraf ’s declaration of martial law as a reason to terminate all aid to his regime .
The United States is so unpopular in the region that supporting a governing alliance between Musharraf and former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto would probably delegitimize even the middle ground in Pakistan .
For moderate forces to have the best chance in that nuclear - armed nation , the United States , paradoxically , should refrain from supporting them , and stay out of Pakistani politics .
Instead of taking its eye off the ball and continuing to take actions that make radical Islamism and anti-U.S. terrorism worse , the Bush administration should content itself with obtaining better intelligence on the whereabouts of bin Laden and his associates .
If such information is found , the United States should take quiet , unilateral action to capture or kill them .

Traditional wind turbines can be unreliable sources of energy because , well , the wind blows where it will .
Not the case 1,000 feet up .
“ At a thousand feet , there is steady wind anywhere in the world , ” says Mac Brown , chief operating officer of Ottawa - based Magenn Power .

The helium - filled Magenn Air Rotor System contains a turbine that spins around a horizontal axis and can produce 10 kilowatts of energy as it floats 1,000 feet above the earth while attached to a copper tether .

To take advantage of this constant breeze , Brown has developed a lighter - than - air wind turbine capable of powering a rural village .
“ Picture a spinning Goodyear blimp , ” Brown says .
Filled with helium , outfitted with electrical generators and tethered to the ground by a conductive copper cable , the 100 - foot - wide Magenn Air Rotor System ( MARS ) will produce 10 kilowatts of energy anywhere on earth .
As the turbine spins around a horizontal axis , the generators convert the mechanical energy of the wind into electrical energy , then send it down for immediate use or battery storage .
Planning for the MARS has been under way for a few years , but this fall Magenn got the $ 5 million it needed to build prototypes from a California investor .
In October , the MARS received its U.S. patent .
Already , larger models  ones that might light a skyscraper  are in the works .
Brown says he hopes his floating wind turbines will power off - the - grid villages in the developing world .
He says the governments of India and Pakistan have expressed interest .
So one of the things I have noticed more and more as I continue to work as a full time blogger is the need for passion about subjects .
Everyone that does well in the blogoshpere does so because they really enjoy talking , writing or otherwise being part of a certain niche .
People that are able to articulate their excitement , and passion create a field around them , and people are drawn into it .
I can say this about Darren Rowse , John Chow , Lorelle VanFossen and many other successful bloggers .
They have something special about them that draws us in , and while we might not always agree with what they say , or some of us resent their success , it is their passion that sets them apart .
So many people ask me how I am able to write on another blog , and how I am able to cover so many niches , and my response is simply that I enjoy it , and if you do something that you know you will still enjoy for years to come , then you will be a success at it .
This article is because of my recent launch of AltSciFi .
I really love science fiction , and I know I have a different view on that subject than many others , but I am very passionate about it , and like I have said to others , even if no new science fiction content was created , I could write on that blog for the rest of my life , covering all that I have seen , thought about and enjoyed over the last twenty - five years of my life .
If you want to be a success , do n’t start a spam blog , do n’t start a crazy mesothelioma lawyer blog in hopes of getting crazy high priced clicks , but instead launch a blog that you will enjoy , and could see yourself writing on for years to come .
Distance learning is on the up and up .
Not only are a record number of students engaging in higher education online - more and more college officials think distance learning is as good as or better than traditional classroom learning , according to a recent study .
But are online degrees , and particularly those earned through online MBA programs , worth the same as traditional degrees ?
Yes , many experts say : there ’s no difference .
According to some proponents , online distance learning is more rigorous than classroom learning , and draws more disciplined students .
Experts see the uptick in online distance education as a good thing , especially for busy working professionals who want advanced degrees but do n’t have time or money to leave their jobs and families for traditional classrooms .

“ A lot of traditional schools require students to take a year or two off .
But a lot of adult learners can’t break from everything to go back to school , ” explained Dr. Rebecca Sidler , faculty chair of the MBA program at Walden University ’s School of Management .
Founded in 1970 , Walden is a distance - learning institution that offers doctorates and master ’s degree programs in a variety of disciplines , including education , management , and psychology , among others .
Dr. Diana G. Oblinger , vice president of Educause , a nonprofit group focused on advancing higher education through technology , said online MBA programs have limitless possibilities .
“ You have the ability to bring in experts that you ’d not be able to bring into a classroom .
You ’d be able to integrate people from around the world , ” Oblinger said .
“ Online MBA programs have begun to do some very creative things because space and time are n’t limiting the programs .
If I wanted to bring someone in from China , they ’re not going to be up at 2 a .m. talking to me , but you can record the information and distribute it to people and have an online discussion . ”
Do Employers Accept Online MBA Programs ?
While distance education has been scrutinized in the past , experts say it ’s more widely embraced nowadays , including among employers .
“ There is no unique difference for an online grad versus a fixed facility grad for similar degrees , ” said Michael P. Lambert , executive director of the Distance Education and Training Council , a nationally recognized accrediting agency for online institutions .
“ There is no difference where they will end up working or [ what they ’ll end up ] earning because they learned it online . ”
Chris Consorte , who teaches both online and traditional MBA students , agreed .
“ In my experience there ’s no difference in salaries .
I find it depends on the person .
A very aggressive student usually leverages his or her degree and finds a job making more and more money , ” explained Consorte , who teaches at Iona College , Mercy College and Long Island University , all in New York state .
Pluses and Minuses of Distance Learning
Though online distance learning is enjoying broader support , there are some drawbacks .
A Sloan Consortium study cites barriers to the widespread adoption of online distance learning .
Topping the list is the concern that “ students need more discipline to succeed in online courses ” - 64 percent of all institutions see it as a significant hurdle .
The number - two concern is the extra time and effort that online faculty spend ; 32 percent of schools think this is a problem .
Other disadvantages include lack of face - to - face feedback and in - person activities with peers , and loneliness , according to DETC ’s Lambert , who also said , “ The few drawbacks are more than offset by the convenience features . ”
Experts say benefits of online distance learning include savings on time and money - no commuting , gas money or parking fees are required .
And some students just function better online .
“ Online there ’s anonymity , you can interact and participate , and you can be whoever you want to be .
For some people it ’s a more comfortable environment for them to study in , ” said Walden ’s Sidler .
Another plus is the increased earning power an MBA brings .
According to 2007 statistics from the Graduate Management Admission Council , a nonprofit group that owns the GMAT , MBA graduates who have gotten job offers typically earn 58 percent more than before they got their degrees .
PayScale ’s MBA salary data shows the median salary for individuals with MBA degrees is $ 78,782 .
Democratic candidates score big with clergy , religious organizations
When it comes to campaign contributions , the 2008 presidential campaign keeps turning the conventional wisdom on its ear .
The political establishment assumes that two reliable allies of conservative Republican candidates are U.S. troops and American clergy .
On the prior , we learned earlier in the fall that military donations are going heavily towards Barack Obama and Ron Paul , both of whom are staunch opponents of the president ’s policy in Iraq .
And on the latter , clergy seem to be defying the conventional wisdom as well .
Clergy and religious organizations contribute to political candidates , just like investment bankers or teachers or any other group .
That clergy give does n’t surprise , but how they ’re giving does . [… ]
Thus far in the ’08 cycle , 56 percent of religious groups ’ and leaders ’ donations have gone to Democrats , and 43 percent to Republicans , compared with 52/47 in favor of Republicans in ’06 and 51/49 in favor of Democrats (! ) in 2004 . [ … ]
You can only read so much into these numbers .
After all , in the aggregate religious groups have backed the losers of the last two elections .
But the partisan gap in contributions is wider now than it ’s been since 1992 .
In three of the last four cycles , clergy have backed Republicans in greater numbers than Democrats .
The lone exception , 2004 , was practically even .
But this year , clergy contributions are going to the Dems by a wide margin — according to the data from the Center for Responsive Politics , 56 % is the strongest percentage Dems have had with clergy donations in two decades .
As for the specific candidates receiving checks from the clergy , the race is n’t even close :
1. Barack Obama : $ 110,000
2. Mitt Romney : $ 39,000
3. Mike Huckabee : $ 23,000
Obviously , as the figures show , clergy are n’t going to compete with oil company executives any time soon when it comes to bundling and / or hosting lucrative fundraisers .
But who would have thought that a Democratic candidate would have raised almost triple the leading Republican when it comes to money from pastors ?
The conventional wisdom is that the faithful overwhelmingly prefer Republicans to Dems .
And yet , there ’s ample evidence to the contrary .

The three admitted conspiring with ex-Enron staff to defraud NatWest
The outcome of the so - called NatWest
Three case points up the dramatic difference between the prosecution of alleged fraud in the US and in the UK .
The men each pleaded guilty to one charge of wire fraud .
If the judge approves the plea bargain conducted between prosecution and defence , they are expected to face 37 months in prison .
They had each been charged with seven counts and if found guilty on all of them , could have been looking at sentences of up to 35 years .
And it this disparity which worries some legal experts .
Sally Ireland , senior legal officer of the organisation , Justice , said : " You have to wonder about the degree of pressure put on defendants to change their plea when the incentive is such a huge reduction in sentence .
" That can catch the innocent in the net as well as the guilty . "
Setting the sentence
There is little doubt that formalised plea bargaining and the use of insider or employee witnesses explains why so many more US fraud trials are successful than in the UK .
About 95 % of cases are resolved in this way .
In the UK , informal discussions have taken place between prosecution and defence in some criminal cases for many years .
Under the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act , 2005 , the system by which a defendant can enter a guilty plea and offer Queen 's Evidence in return for a discounted sentence was , for the first time , placed on a statutory footing .
But it is the judge , rather than the prosecution , who sets the sentence .
In 2006 , a Whitehall review set up to examine the prosecution of fraud trials , recommended that those facing fraud allegations should be able to reach a deal with prosecutors even before charges are brought .
There will be intense interest in the outcome of their fight
Jon Silverman
This would depend on defendants having a degree of certainty about the sentence they would face .
The director of the Serious Fraud Office , Robert Wardle , supports such a move , as well as tougher sentences for fraud .
The case of the NatWest Three was notable for the storm of protest over the 2003 Extradition
Act which , critics said , made it far easier for the US to extradite a suspect from Britain than the other way round .
At the time the men were sent to Texas to face trial , the US Congress had not even ratified the treaty .
Under pressure from the UK government , it has since done so .
But concerns remain that US prosecutors and courts are pursuing an expansionist strategy which will see more foreign - based suspects falling into the clutches of the US judicial process .
A British computer hacker , Gary McKinnon , and a British financier , Ian Norris , are both resisting extradition requests through the courts here .
There will be intense interest in the outcome of their fight .
Fortunately , no one seems to have noticed that I wrote last week ’s column with one eye closed .
I also had the lights in my office off , the shades drawn and the thermostat turned up to about 85 degrees .
All this because I had a migraine .
In fact , I was on day six of a migraine that would , by day seven , have me dissolving into tears in between the taped segments of my radio show .
( Think Holly Hunter .
Think “ Broadcast News . ”
The show went on , seamlessly . )
I was suffering like this because I was Taking Control of my life .
I ’d recently read “ Heal Your Headache , ” by the Johns Hopkins University neurologist David Buchholz .
And now I was following his “ 1 - 2 - 3 Program for Taking Charge of Your Pain . ”
In Dr. Buchholz ’s view , chronic migraine sufferers like me — I average around seven to twelve headaches a month — are , very often , victims of their own past treatment successes .
Triptans , the new - ish class of drugs that bind to serotonin receptors and can work wonders when taken early in migraine attacks , cause rebound headaches , he says , if you take them more than two days a month .
So do over - the - counter painkillers and stronger stuff like codeine and oxycodone .
Step 1 in his plan , then , involves removing such “ quick fix ” drugs from your life .
Step 2 is about recognizing your migraine “ triggers ” and removing the ones – like certain foods , alcohol and caffeine – that you can do something about .
( As opposed to the ones – like changes in barometric pressure , work deadlines and mothers - in - law — that you ca n’t do anything about . )
Step 3 is daily preventive medicine – but the idea , in Buchholz ’s book , is that if you do well enough at Steps 1 and 2 , you might not have to go to Step 3 .
I am already there .
And I have been trying to get out .
I ’ve had migraine headaches since the age of 8 .
When I was younger , they were severe , but infrequent .
When I turned 35 , they turned chronic .
They were — at best , when the triptans were working — fatiguing .
At worst , they sent me to the emergency room .
A few years ago , they got much better for a while when I started taking amitriptyline , a tricyclic antidepressant ( formerly known as Elavil ) that is now given , in low doses , as a migraine preventative .
I did n’t like the amitriptyline .
It made me gain weight .
It made me sleepy .
It made me think of mental patients shuffling down the corridors of state hospitals in the 1950s .
I was n’t willing to take the higher doses of amitriptyline that came to be needed , over time , to allow the drug to really work .
I liked the idea that , through supreme force of will , I could free myself from the iron grip of Big Pharma .
So I followed Buchholz ’s prescriptions .
I stopped taking my Relpax , a triptan , and put away my Prontalgine , the codeine - and caffeine - containing , French over - the - counter headache remedy that I use when the Relpax does n’t work .
I stopped drinking caffeine and alcohol and stopped eating chocolate , cheese , M.S.G. , nuts , vinegar , citrus fruits , bananas , raspberries , avocados , onions , fresh bagels and donuts , pizza , yogurt , sour cream , ice cream , aspartame and all aged , cured , fermented , marinated , smoked , tenderized or nitrate - preserved meats .
For a couple of weeks , I was ravenously hungry , cranky , spaced out and vaguely , deprivedly resentful .
But I felt , headache - wise , somewhat improved .
I had six or nine migraines , but they were less severe .
And , once I got used to it , I came to almost enjoy being on my diet , exploring my capacity for hunger and self - abnegation , obsessing over what foods I could eat , and how , and when .
At the very least , the diet made my friends happy .
Renouncing food , renouncing pills , is so often , in our time , seen as the right and righteous , pure and wholesome thing to do .
And then the headaches returned , with a vengeance .
Earlier this week , I went to see my neurologist , who for months has been trying to get me to increase my dosage of amitriptyline or go on topamax , an anti-seizure drug that also prevents migraines .
“ Are you enjoying your suffering ? ” he asked me .
Eagerly pocketing my topamax script , I asked him if he thought that food elimination could hold out any last hope .
Maybe , he said , smirking down into his notes ; you never know .
“ You could always go up to Baltimore and ask Dr. Buchholz . ”
Many people who take daily medications come at some point to hate them .
Teenagers with ADHD routinely rebel against their meds .
Long - term users of anti-depressants risk relapse because they can no longer stand the way the drugs make them feel .
Some people do manage , through diet and exercise , or by protecting themselves from their worst “ triggers , ” to free themselves from their drugs .
But many ca n’t do it .
Many find they ca n’t accept living in the compromised condition that drug - free existence requires .
A smart high school girl I know switched a few years ago from a mainstream school , where she was struggling with dyslexia and ADHD , to a school that specializes in teaching kids with severe learning disabilities .
Being there has permitted her to function without her ADHD meds .
But now she ’s bored .
She ’s dispirited by the lack of academic challenge and she wants out , because she ’s afraid that , without academic challenges , she wo n’t be able to get into a mainstream college .
That ’s the tradeoff : taking daily drugs , or living a life that feels not quite worth living .
Halloween is coming , and Emilie and I have a ritual :
While trick or treating , we eat exactly one piece of candy after every house .
She gives me the Snickers bars .
She keeps the Hershey ’s Kisses and the M&Ms .
We split the caramel creams and the Starbursts and pawn the dark chocolate off on her sister , Julia .
It ’s from routines such as this , I am convinced , that the childhood roots of adult happiness are formed .
This year she ’s anxious .
I ’m not eating chocolate .
Or peanuts .
This week , with her babysitter , she baked me a cake , white with white frosting , sprinkles , multi-colored flowers and candy corn .
But , she asked me , what will happen on Halloween ?
I told her not to worry ; I ’d eat my Snickers bars .
In fact , I think that I ’ll sanctify Halloween by eating every single forbidden food on the migraine diet , all in the space of a couple of hours .
Somehow , I doubt that I ’ll end up in the emergency room .

Why active record sucks
It is not really Active Record ( AR ) which sucks but the implied , perhaps just misinterpreted , common usage as an ORM ( object relational mapping ) .
To summarize the following blog post in one sentence , so that you may skip reading it :
Active Record may be used to implement ORM , but it should never be used as an ORM .
What is Active Record again ?
Active Record ( AR ) , Table Row Gateway , Table Data Gateway ... let 's not difference between them , but just consider the concept of plain mapping of a row to an object with properties representing the columns of a table .
Of course you always have some mechanism which enables you to fetch the related contents depending on your ERM ( entity relationship model ) .
This may happen with explicit calls to fetch , let 's say , the author of a news post , or a more advanced implementation of AR may even construct JOINS in the initial query to fetch all requested related data .
This sounds perfect to map my business objects to the database , or ?
The basic model
Considering a very simple DB model AR may work for you .
Let 's consider the following structure for something like a very simple news system :
+-----------+ | Article | +-----------+ | id | +--------+ | author_id | ---> | Author | | title | +--------+ | text | | id |
+-----------+ | name | | email | +--------+
For such a structure even AR fulfills all basic requirements for an ORM , when you extend the basic classes with some validations , which are not topic of this blog post .
Causing some trouble
Having a model and an easy to use interface which provide full access to the data , and abstracts away the SQL by generating the queries still seems a quite perfect solution - so let 's introduce some requirements which are not properly realizable with Active Record .
This is - of course - not a complete list , but very basic and quite common requirements for a data model .
Translation , Versioning and Status
A quite common requirement is translation of contents .
In this case you want to add some key to your table containing the contents of your application which somehow maps to a language .
The logical consequence is , that you get more then one article with the same value in the column ' id ' and need to define a multi column index on the columns ' id ' and ' ~ language ' .
If somebody is able to edit contents , which commonly will be true for articles managed by some web interface , you should introduce content versioning in your application , so that no content is lost , if somebody accidentally deleted some text or somebody abuses his rights to do bad stuff .
Here the same applies as for translation - you need an additional column representing the version and you get a three column primary index for your data .
I am not really sure if there are an AR implementation which handle the case of multi column indexes properly - if you know some please point me to them , but even if it is supported you end up with a messy table containing not normalized data , with duplicate titles , which are not required to store , if they did not change between two versions .
You may also have some other attributes like states ( " published " , " draft " , ... ) for your content which will pollute your table even more .
State changes on one version of an article / in one row will result in the loss of change histories - and otherwise you might just need to copy the complete the contents of an article , because it has been published by the editor without any changes in an article draft ...
Variants
Think of the case you do not only want to show articles on your website , but some other contents , like blog posts which also contain a list of tags or categories , perhaps you want to include project news which also contain some release information ...
This will either mess up you basic table by adding optional attributes which destroys the semantic meaning of the table by containing completely different stuff , or you would need to add several new tables which will be aggregated into one list , sorted by some common criteria and handled by different views .
Now think of a online shop , or some other complex website , where you do not only have three types of contents , but hundreds or thousands - you may come up with the idea of serializing the content specific data in some way ( XML , PHP specific stuff , JSON , ... ) , but you are not serious about that , are you ?
This would lead to a whole bunch of other problems like the requirement for specialized search engines , unnecessary parsing , using semantical information from the DB view ...
Relations
A different requirement where AR fails totally used as an ORM are n:m relations with associated metadata .
To stay with model introduced above you could imagine that you want to add references to existing articles in a new article you write - of course it should be a potentially finite count of article references .
The metadata could be a description why you add this article as a reference , some date and / or link title - a table like this would be the result :
+----------------+ | reference |
+----------------+ | source_id | | destination_id | | title | | description | | date | +----------------+
In the optimal cases - the AR implementation automagically fetches the right articles for you - you would end up with an article object containing a bunch of objects with the reference metadata , each containing the destination article object .
But , from a business object point of view , there are two things wrong now with your data structure .
You normally just some reference objects to render in a defined way in your views , and the articles of course should not be fetched multiple times , if one article references another one multiple times .
You can work with this case , you may be able to handle it properly in your views , but this wo n't be the data structure you probably would design when not having the database scheme in your mind - and letting the abstraction layer define you business object structure just is the wrong way to go .
Conclusion
The conclusion is simple :
You either destroy your business objects or your DB model .
This " OR " is not a " XOR " - you may even destroy both , just because you used the wrong tool for the right job - ORM per se is nothing bad .
The above described examples force you to use hacks of a model which originally were thought to clean up your data storage system and offer a nice model .
You may reach the opposite .
Proper ORM
As usually , doing something the proper way , it gets harder .
I am sorry for this ; ) .
And as always , there is no magic store , where you may just put your data , without thinking about your application and hope that everything works perfectly ...
A trivial model
Let 's take a look at one model which can map the above described problems - for now ignoring the relations .
This is of course not the ultimate solution , but just an example .
I will mention some of its weaknesses later .
Entity Relationship Model : Object Relation Mapping
The model is structured in four table clusters .
Content class
The content class is the equivalence to some class definition in your object orientated code .
It defines the structure of some content , which has been done in the AR example above by the SQL table .
To define the content class for an article you create an entry in the table content_class with a well chosen name and create entries in the table content_class_attribute with the properties of your content class - title and text in the example above .
Those attributes are of some attribute type which may be anything from string , text , date , integer up to complex data types like ( multi ) select boxes , geo information , models , images or something completely different .
Obviously you are then able to automagically create forms using various widgets ( combinations ) - but this is not really relevant when it comes to the data model .
Instance
Of course you should be able to have a finite count of instances ( articles ) of your content class ( article ) .
Those are stored once , with an optional name and a reference to the defining content class in the table content_object .
The real instances , beside the identifier , are the versions - if you want language and / or status aware - in the table content_object_version .
The attributes data , which actually somehow defines the object , is stored content_object_data with the obvious references to the obvious tables .
The version and object data tables are using a multi column index on version , language and id here .
Metadata
You see very few essential metadata in the example , like the language , status , creator and the creation date .
The last two ones probably would better fir in some abstracted metadata storage extended by tags , ratings or whatever you want to add here .
This is not really relevant .
Attributes
As written earlier you can easily generate forms ( not only for ( X ) HTML ) from those content class definitions , but you can also easily include descriptions , configurations of data types ( with some default configuration options in the table attribute_type ) , which may define valid value ranges , limit the host for some URL or whatever you imagine .
If an attribute has not been changed in a new version of a content object you may automatically fetch it from earlier versions of the content objects without any real drawbacks , but this may result in more complex queries .
It is up to you to find the proper balance for your application - as always .
And the n:m relations ?
Until now nothing is defined for the code basis you use .
You just may define a common n:m relation with some metadata .
In the case of busimess.org , for example , the relation data again is defined by a structure like the one above .
Considerations
This model only eliminates the drawbacks on the DB model side , no possible drawback on the application side , like mentioned above with relations in AR .
Implementing this model as a backend in your application you should do the mapping or use some content management framework which already implements a model like this .
Enhancements to the model
eZ Publish , for example does not only versions and translate the content objects , but also the content classes - you may imagine that this makes some of the queries even a bit more complex , but when good caching comes in place here , this should n't be such a big deal with common requirements - and if you have very special performance requirements you still may use views , another model or more caching ; ) .
And - as written earlier - this is not meant being the optional model for each use case .
Something like this obviously does not exist .
Including model in your application
The earlier mentioned relations between objects are one way to include such a model in your application , if you have data only structured by some graph , as known from computer science .
This is true for wikipedia , for example , where the only structure is given by references between articles - hard to brows for the visitor and not a very common access method .
Tree
Far more common are trees which put the data into a hierarchic structure - this can be read as some navigation , or maybe you also want to structure the data not displayed on your website in a tree and only display a subtree .
This can be done easily by using some extra table defining the hierarchic structure using some of the common algorithms to map trees into a database like parent child relations , or nested sets where the nodes relate to some object .
You may want to consider being able to connect one object to multiple nodes ...
eZ Publish
In eZ Publish you get one tree which contains objects , similar to the ones described above , connected to one or more nodes of the tree ( where one is the main node ) .
Additionally you get the possibility to add relations between the objects ( so that you do n't have a tree any more in theory , but this does not really matter anywhere ) .
Each object in eZ Publish is connect to at least one node , and nearly everything is such an content object .
Even users , for example , are only sub content objects of a subtree which is an instance of the content class user group .
Of course you may also add user content objects to other nodes , you may define permissions on parent content class , define which content class / object may have childdren at all , or which children it may have , for users or groups , or complete sub trees , either by sub tree or section .
Going into detail here obviously wo n't fit any blog post . ;)
Other ORMs
There are complete different ways to define your ORM .
You may use an arbitrary table structure and define some random mapping using some XML definitions , or even a mapping in your database .
Both ways can make the mapping completely independent from your business objects and your database schema .
Then ... why does AR exist at all ?
AR still may be used for accessing the tables in the model described above .
If this makes sense again depends on your use case , and - for example - may be useful as an abstraction layer of the used relational database management system .
Also you may try using some AR framework to just do rapid prototyping .
But you should know the limited scope of this approach - and hope your boss will not come into your office and request something which may not be implemented using AR - or you can just do a quick hack , of course . ;)
Conclusion
As shown , AR is just a wrapper for database access and not appropriate as an ORM .
Used carefully , or with very simple applications it really may proof useful .
But there are other ways to abstract the access to your database like query construction using some object orientated interface , like it is done in the database component in eZ Components .
The classes then may create SQL which work with the currently used RDBMS .
Another ( slow ) way is parsing the query given by the user and restructuring for the current relational database management system .
The possibilities for object relational mapping described in this blog post are initially more complicate to use , but also may offer great extensibility , real mapping with future proof concepts .
You wo n't run in the discussed problems .
But , as always , higher abstraction cause more complex code and may bring you a performance impact - which could be solved by proper caching .
And , there is no perfect system to solve all your needs , which some people think Active Record was , but you should review your modelling concepts .
Other solutions
There are completely different solutions which may work better with your object structures like CouchDB - something Jan blogged about and is a really cool solution which does not force any relational database structures and still are ACID .
TECATE , Calif. , Dec. 6 
The tunnel opening cut into the floor of a shipping container here drops three levels , each accessible by ladders , first a metal one and then two others fashioned from wood pallets .
The tunnel stretches 1,300 feet to the south , crossing the Mexican border some 50 feet below ground and proceeding to a sky - blue office building in sight of the steel - plated border fence .
Three or four feet wide and six feet high , the passageway is illuminated by compact fluorescent bulbs ( wired to the Mexican side ) , supported by carefully placed wooden beams and kept dry by two pumps .
The neatly squared walls , carved through solid rock , bear the signs of engineering skill and professional drilling tools .
Shrink - wrapped bundles of marijuana , nearly 14,000 pounds worth $ 5.6 million in street sales , were found in the shipping container and in a trailer next to it , making clear the tunnel ’s purpose : to serve as another major smuggling corridor .
Found Monday here in Tecate , it is the latest of 56 cross - border tunnels found in the Southwest since the onset of additional guards and fencing aboveground after Sept. 11 , 2001 .
“ I ’m never alarmed when they are found , ” said a senior investigator with a task force of federal law enforcement agencies still combing the scene Tuesday .
“ I am alarmed we do n’t find them enough . ”
Scientists on Monday announced the discovery of what appears to be the world 's most intact dinosaur mummy : a 67 - million - year - old plant - eater that contains fossilized bones and skin tissue , and possibly muscle and organs .
Preserved by a natural fluke of time and chemistry , the four - ton mummified hadrosaur , a duck - billed herbivore common to North America , could reshape the understanding of dinosaurs and their habitat , its finders say .
" There is no doubt about it that this dinosaur is a very , very significant find , " said Tyler Lyson , a graduate student in geology at Yale University who discovered the dinosaur in North Dakota .
" To say we are excited would be an understatement , " said Phil Manning , a paleontologist at England 's University of Manchester who is leading the examination .
" When I first saw it in the field , ( I thought ) ' Shiiiit , that 's a really well preserved dinosaur . '
It has the potential to be a top - 10 dinosaur , globally . "
After excavating the dinosaur , scientists encased it and the surrounding soil in plaster .
It was hauled to Boeing 's giant CT scanner near Los Angeles .
Photo : National Geographic ChannelNicknamed Dakota , the hadrosaur is one of only five naturally preserved dinosaur mummies ever discovered .
Unlike previous dinosaur mummies , which typically involve skin impressions pressed into bones , Dakota 's entire skin envelope appears to remain largely intact .
" The skin has been mineralized , " said Manning .
" It is an actual three - dimensional structure , backfilled with sediment . "
The fidelity of the envelope , he said , raises the possibility that Dakota could contain other soft - tissue remnants , including muscles and organs .
Then - 16 - year - old Lyson was fossil - hunting in 1999 in the Hell Creek Formation badlands of North Dakota when he first spotted the dinosaur 's bone - like protrusion from a hill .
In 2004 , after Lyson returned to begin excavating the fossil and discovered skin remnants , a friend studying at the University of Manchester alerted Manning , who had the experience and resources to organize a more cautious excavation .
Only after the body and a chunk of the hillside was moved to a lab did the scientists realize the extent of the discovery .
" On vast areas of the tail and body , " Manning said , " there was what looked to be a three - dimensional skin envelope , in the same way as a sock around your foot – which did not make any sense at all . "
Manning brought on dozens of scientists and engineers – in disciplines ranging from computer science to organic chemistry and physics – to investigate every aspect of the find using state - of - the - art tools .
" Up until Phil showed me this dinosaur , " said Roy Wogelius , a geochemist from the University of Manchester studying the soil surrounding Dakota , " I had no interest in dinosaurs .
As soon as I saw this specimen , I was fascinated . "
In North Dakota , the researchers used Light Detection and Ranging equipment ( LiDAR ) to develop a three - dimensional topographical map of the area where Dakota died .
Manning speculated that the dinosaur collapsed in a riverbed during the late Cretaceous Period and was rapidly buried in mineral - rich wet sand , preventing bacteria from devouring all of its tissue .
" There was active - enough chemistry in the sediments that the decay process did n't occur as quickly as the mineralization process , " he said .
" It was a perfect chemical soup . "
The CT scan showed that the hadrosaur 's vertebrae , which museums commonly stack together , are actually spaced a centimeter apart .
That means we may have been underestimating the size of many dinosaurs .
Image : National Geographic ChannelAfter examining the dinosaur at a local lab , the scientists encased it and the remaining surrounding soil in plaster and hauled it by truck to a Boeing research center in Canoga Park , California , north of Los Angeles .
There , Boeing volunteered the world 's largest computerized tomography , or CT , scanner , originally built by NASA to scan space shuttle parts for flaws .
At 8,000 pounds , the fossil became the largest object ever scanned at high resolution .
The researchers are using the data to survey the body 's interior before chipping away further on the fossil .
" The CT scan is like a roadmap , " said Manning .
" It will help us recover the rest of the animal more easily and efficiently . "
The first significant findings from the dinosaur , currently under review at a major scientific journal , will describe the unique chemical balance that preserved the fossil .
The body , meanwhile , remains on the Boeing scanner , as Manning and his colleagues sift through terabytes of data .
So far , they have determined that the hadrosaur 's hindquarters are 25 percent larger than previously thought for the species , meaning that it could run up to 28 mph – faster than previously estimated .
They have also discovered that the specimen 's vertebrae , which museums commonly stack together , are actually spaced 10 millimeters apart .
The result , Manning said , implies that scientists may have been underestimating the size of hadrosaurs and other dinosaurs .
The National Geographic Channel , which helped fund the research , will recount the saga of Dakota 's discovery in a documentary , Dino Autopsy , Sunday , Dec. 9 , at 9 p.m. EST .
Manning is also publishing a book , Grave Secrets of Dinosaurs , describing the fossil and its history .
Although there are a lot of scientists involved in the project , Lyson and Manning have not yet allowed experts outside the project to assess the mummified dinosaur .

TEHRAN ( Reuters ) - Iran is defiant in a row with the West over its disputed atomic plans but may be seeking to ease tension with the United States by trying to restrain Shi’ite militias in Iraq and restricting arms crossing the border .

U.S. officials , who accuse predominantly Shi’ite Muslim Iran of stirring up instability in its neighbor , appear to have softened their language in the past few weeks and pointed to a decline in attacks in Iraq by groups using Iranian munitions .
Some analysts say this may show Iran ’s desire to tone down a war of words about Tehran ’s nuclear goals .
Washington says Iran is seeking to build bombs and that , if the country succeeds , it could spark World War Three .
Iran says its aims are peaceful .
“ For both sides , there is some logic in at least trying to reduce tension , ” said one Iranian political analyst .
“ For both sides , the prospect of confrontation is dangerous . ”
Iraq ’s foreign minister , Hoshiyar Zebari , said last week Iran had helped “ rein in ” militias blamed for fuelling violence .
Tehran may be trying to show goodwill at the same time as it underlines its ability to cause trouble again if pushed , said security expert Mustafa Alani .
“ It is ( aiming ) to prove the size and weight of Iranian influence in Iraq , ” said Alani , who is based in Dubai .
But analysts said it was difficult to assess Iran ’s motives and the extent of its ability to shape developments in Iraq , where many majority Shi’ites may feel more loyalty towards their own country than Tehran , despite close religious ties .
FEWER ATTACKS
Iran has consistently dismissed accusations it is arming and training allied groups in Iraq and says the violence there is due to the presence of U.S. forces , which it wants withdrawn .
“ I do n’t think Iran has as strong influence in Iraq as the Americans want to show , but they do have influence , ” said one European diplomat in Tehran , who was skeptical that Iran had changed tack over Iraq .
U.S. officials have attributed falls in U.S. military and Iraqi civilian casualties in the past two months to a “ surge ” of 30,000 extra U.S. troops and tribal Sunni Arab sheikhs organizing supporters into local police units .
They have also noted a sharp drop in mortar attacks on Baghdad ’s heavily fortified Green Zone last month .
Many of those have been blamed on Shi’ite militias using Iranian - made weapons .
Another Western diplomat in Tehran said Iran appeared to be curbing the flow of weapons to Iraq , a policy which could be reversed if it felt the need , even though Iran would ultimately prefer to have a stable neighbor .
“ I do see some restriction here on arms exports ( to Iraq ) , but they could just open the border , ” he said .
Alani said reduced Iranian activities in Iraq may also be a response to a successful U.S. crackdown .
The United States , which cut ties shortly after Iran ’s 1979 Islamic revolution , has not ruled out military action if diplomacy fails to convince Tehran to halt its atomic work .
Iran , the world ’s fourth largest oil producer , has refused to stop , saying it wants the technology to make electricity .
IRAN “ SEEING SENSE ”
Any lessening of tension , even if restricted to Iraq , may be welcomed by oil markets , where fears of Middle East turmoil have helped to push up prices towards $ 100 per barrel .
British - based defense analyst Paul Beaver suggested that Iran may be trying to lower the risk of any conflict with the United States .
“ Iran has the power to make life easier in Iraq ’s south and on the border , or make it worse , and it really seems from my perspective that they appear to be seeing sense , ” Beaver said .
But Christopher Pang , head of the Middle East and North Africa program of the Royal United Services Institute in London , stressed internal Iraqi developments in explaining the reduction in violence .
He pointed to a ceasefire called by Moqtada al - Sadr , head of the feared Shi’ite Mehdi Army , in August and said this group had realized “ it is not in their interest to foment further intra-sectarian violence . ”
U.S. officials accuse Sadr of having close links with Iran .
In what some have seen as another sign of easing tension , the U.S. military last week freed nine Iranians held in Iraq , including two it accused of links to Iran ’s Qods force , which handles the foreign activities of Iran ’s Revolutionary Guards .
Zebari , Iraq ’s foreign minister , said he believed it would “ enhance confidence ” in dialogue between Iran and the United States over Iraq .
Both sides have indicated willingness to attend further talks after three meetings so far this year .
But in comments highlighting Washington ’s deep - seated suspicions about Tehran ’s aims , a U.S. general on Sunday said extensive Iranian influence in Iraq remained evident and that 20 Iranian - trained agents were still operating south of Baghdad .
" Merry Christmas , Mr. President , " hissed the men in cloaks as they plunged a dagger into George Bush 's back .
America 's spooks finally had their revenge .
After being forced by the White House in 2002 - 03 to concoct a farrago of lies about Iraq , and then take the blame for the ensuing fiasco there , the 16 U.S. intelligence agencies struck back this week .
U.S. intelligence chief Mike McConnell made public a bombshell National Intelligence Estimate ( NIE ) report that concluded " with high confidence " Tehran had halted its rudimentary nuclear weapons program in 2003 .
If restarted , Iran is unlikely to produce any weapons before 2015 .
The new NIE is a devastating , humiliating blow to Bush , Dick Cheney and the neocons who have been fulminating for war against Iran .
Only two months ago , Bush warned Americans that Iran 's secret nuclear program threatened to ignite World War III .
A 2005 NIE report that billed Iran as a major nuclear threat was based on fabricated evidence supplied to the CIA , just like the bogus Niger uranium story used to justify war against Iraq .
Who , one wonders , is behind this disinformation ?
Bush was given the new NIE on Iran last August .
But for the past four months , Bush , Cheney and Condoleezza Rice have been beating the war drums over Iran when their own massed intelligence agencies have been telling them there was no danger from that country .
The White House hid its own intelligence community 's findings from the public until the spooks threatened to leak the report .
AHMADINEJAD TRUTHFUL
Ironically , Iran 's leader , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , was telling the truth all along when he said Iran was not working on nuclear arms , while Bush & Company were lying through their teeth , just as they have over Iraq and Afghanistan .
This column has been reporting for two years the growing opposition at the CIA , the Pentagon , and the State Department to Bush / Cheney 's plans to launch a war against Iran .
I repeatedly heard the term " fifth column " used to describe the fanatical neocon ideologues pressing America into a second Mideast war .
Now , America 's national security community is telling the White House to cease and desist before it drags the nation into another foreign catastrophe .
While not a coup as in " Seven Days in May , " it was the next closest thing .
At the heart of this drama lies the disturbing fact that Bush / Cheney & Co. were simply ignoring their own $ 40 - billion - plus - a - year intelligence community .
TRY ANOTHER SOURCE
When the White House did n't get the answers it wanted on Iran , it turned to Israel , whose renowned intelligence agency , Mossad , became a primary source .
Mossad still insists Iran will have a nuclear bomb by 2008 .
Israeli Defence Minister Ehud Barak declared the NIE report a " blow to the groin . "
Israel has been straining every sinew to get the U.S. to destroy Iran 's growing nuclear infrastructure .
Whether Israel , which has a large nuclear arsenal , will attack Iran on its own is uncertain .
This is the final disgrace for Bush & Cheney .
Their war propaganda and efforts to suppress the new NIE should constitute grounds for immediate impeachment .
If Bill Clinton could be impeached for lying about oral sex , should n't Bush and Cheney face trial for attempting to lie and deceive Americans into yet another war of aggression ?
Alas , Congress , many of whose members also have been howling for war against Iran , lacks the guts for such action .
CONFIRMED
America 's intelligence has been lousy in the past , and might be wrong again .
But UN nuclear inspectors confirm the U.S. findings .
So does SVR , Russia 's intelligence agency .
Iran 's civilian nuclear power program eventually could produce highly enriched uranium for weapons , but there is no sign of Iran developing any long - range delivery capability .
The NIE is likely to release Iran from U.S. - imposed isolation , and undermine the anti-Iran coalition the U.S. was assembling .
It should put the kibosh on Bush 's idiotic plans for an anti-missile system in Poland and the Czech Republic .
Sanity is slowly returning to Washington .

The prospect for the wide spread use of hydrogen as a portable energy carrier is dependent on finding a clean , renewable method of production .
At Penn State University , a research group headed by professor of electrical engineering Craig Grimes in the Materials Research Institute is “ only a couple of problems away ” from developing an inexpensive and easily scalable technique for water photoelectrolysis - the splitting of water into hydrogen and oxygen using light energy – that could help power the proposed hydrogen economy .
Most current methods of hydrogen production split hydrogen from natural gas in a process that produces climate changing greenhouse gas while consuming a nonrenewable resource .
A more environmentally friendly approach would produce hydrogen from water using the renewable energy of sunlight .
In a paper published online in Nano Letters on July 3 , 2007 , lead author Gopal K. Mor , along with Haripriya E. Prakasam , Oomman K. Varghese , Kathik Shankar , and Grimes , describe the fabrication of thin films made of self - aligned , vertically oriented titanium iron oxide ( Ti - Fe - O ) nanotube arrays that demonstrate the ability to split water under natural sunlight .
Previously , the Penn State scientists had reported the development of titania nanotube arrays with a photoconversion efficiency of 16.5 % under ultraviolet light .
Titanium oxide ( TiO2 ) , which is commonly used in white paints and sunscreens , has excellent charge - transfer properties and corrosion stability , making it a likely candidate for cheap and long lasting solar cells .
However , as ultraviolet light contains only about 5 % of the solar spectrum energy , the researchers needed to finds a means to move the materials band gap into the visible spectrum .
They speculated that by doping the TiO2 film with a form of iron called hematite , a low band gap semiconductor material , they could capture a much larger portion of the solar spectrum .
The researchers created Ti-Fe metal films by sputtered titanium and iron targets on fluorine - doped tin oxide coated glass substrates .
The films were anodized in an ethylene glycol solution and then crystallized by oxygen annealing for 2 hours .
They studied a variety of films of differing thicknesses and varying iron content .
In this paper they report a photocurrent of 2 mA / cm2 , and a photoconversion rate of 1.5 % , the second highest rate achieved with an iron oxide related material .
The team is now looking into optimizing the nanotube architecture to overcome the low electron - hole mobility of iron .
By reducing the wall thickness of the Ti-Fe - O nanotubes to correspond to the hole diffusion length of iron which is around 4nm , the researchers hope to reach an efficiency closer to the 12.9 % theoretical maximum for materials with the band gap of hematite .
“ As I see it , we are a couple of problems away from having something that will revolutionize the field of hydrogen generation by use of solar energy , ” Grimes says .
First , and most importantly , he corrects the wrong impression given by the title of his most famous book , The Selfish Gene .
Many people took this to mean that he thought that human beings had no option but to act selfishly .
Quite the contrary .
At a personal level , Dawkins believes that whatever the evolutionary processes that have brought us where we are , we have a responsibility to act as moral agents .
He grounds this in the fact that although genes always act in such a way as to maximise their chance of replicating themselves , the organism of which they are a part may in fact act altruistically , this being the way the genes optimise their chance of surviving .
He gives four examples of this , two being well - known .
One is how mammals can act with great altruism on behalf of their offspring .
Another is the reciprocal benefits that flowers and bees bring to each other through the process of pollination .
This co-operation increases the chances of the genes of each of them surviving .
In a more speculative way , Dawkins then builds on this in suggesting that as the sex instinct is not limited to reproduction but can find a broader focus in its contribution to culture , so this capacity to think of others is no longer confined to helping kin or forms of reciprocal altruism , but can find wider expressions .
From a philosophical point of view , this is important in refuting the idea that as humans we will always be driven by considerations of narrow self - interest , that morality is unnatural to our evolutionary make - up .
On the contrary , Dawkins shows that it is just as built - in for mammals such as ourselves to act in the interest of others .
Morality is part of our nature .
Dawkins also draws on the work of Peter Singer and Marc Hauser who presented two moral dilemmas to a wide range of people .
In the first , a railway truck careering out of control down a track is about to kill five people in the way .
But the onlooker has the chance of pulling a lever and diverting the truck on to a siding where there is one person standing , who will inevitably be killed .
Do you pull the lever ?
The vast majority of people of all ages , ethnic and cultural backgrounds said yes .
In the other dilemma , there is no lever or siding , but a bridge on which sits a very fat man .
If this man is pushed and falls in front of the truck , it will be stopped and save five lives .
The onlooker is too light to make any difference to the truck , so jumping himself would serve no good purpose .
But he is strong enough to push the fat man off .
Should he do it ?
The vast majority of people , again from every conceivable background , said no .
Peter Singer draws some conclusions from this that I do not want to do myself , but the important point is that people 's moral judgments have far more in common than used to be thought .
There was a time when people loved to emphasise the alleged differences between different societies and hence the relativity of all moral judgments .
But it seems we all inhabit a moral realm which we can recognise as such .
This is no surprise to monotheists who believe that all of us , whatever we believe or do not believe , have been created in the image of God and this means we have an ability not only to think , but to have some insight into what is right and what is wrong .
In its most philosophical form , it is a belief in natural law , and in its most advanced legal form , a belief in universal human rights .
Dostoevsky 's Ivan Karamazov said : ' If God did not exist , everything would be permitted . '
Sartre agreed .
Dawkins disagrees .
Morality belongs to us as human beings .
I agree too .
I do not believe that a society without a religious basis for its morality will always collapse .
But I do think that the relationship between morality and religion is more complex than either Dawkins or religious believers usually allow .
Take an analogy : someone hears a great piece of music and responds to it in itself .
But someone else knows that the piece is part of a symphony and can be even more appreciated when heard as part of the whole in which it has a crucial place .
As human beings we can recognise and respond to particular moral insights .
But a religious believer claims to understand these as part of a much larger whole in which they have a vital place : in particular , there is a fount and origin of all our moral insights which is good , perfect good , all good , our true and everlasting good .
For a Christian , this is above all shown in the willingness of God to enter the flux of history , to redeem it from within .
Religious people have been at fault in the past for slagging off moralities that did not have a faith basis .
Today , it is the other way round , with religion being widely criticised for stopping people acting with moral maturity .
But the crisis of moral values is such that we should simply recognise and rejoice in the good wherever it is to be found , while continuing to converse about whether it has its place in a larger scheme of things .
Commenting on the view that a society without religion will collapse , Dawkins writes : ' Perhaps naively , I have inclined towards a less cynical view of human nature than Ivan Karamazov .
Do we really need policing - whether by God or each other - in order to stop us from behaving in a selfish and criminal manner ?
I dearly want to believe that I do not need such surveillance - and nor , dear reader , do you . '
But this overlooks a number of points .
First , many people who have strong moral commitments without any religious foundation were shaped by parents or grandparents for whom morality and religion were fundamentally bound up .
Moreover , many of those in the forefront of progressive political change , who have abandoned religion , have been driven by a humanism that has been essentially built up by our Christian heritage as Charles Taylor has recently brought out in his magisterial study , A Secular Age .
How far are we living on moral capital ?
Then , although I believe there is a shard of goodness in every human person , there is a dark side to our nature that it is sentimental to ignore , one which is still wreaking such terrible havoc .
As WH Auden put it : ' We have to love our crooked neighbour with our crooked heart . '
This points to the need for both self - knowledge and grace .
At the beginning of this new year , with the world so stricken with growing inequality , corruption , decadence and conflict , each of us , believer and unbeliever alike , need all the help we can get .

A group of Japanese science agencies announced today that the area of the Arctic Sea covered by ice is at its lowest level ever recorded .
It reached this low point on August 15th , and it ’s going to get worse .
Ice levels should continue to shrink all the way through mid-September .
If reality matches predictions , the ice levels will reach IPCC predictions 40 years ahead of schedule .
On August 15th , 2007 the area of Arctic sea ice was 5.31 million square km ( 2.1 million square miles ) .
This beats the previous record of 5.32 million seen back in September 2005 .
That might sound like it ’s almost the same amount , but just you wait , ice is expected to continue shrinking until mid-September , getting as small as 4.5 million square km .
These results were announced today by the Japan Agency for Marine - Earth Science and Technology ( JAMSTEC ) and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency ( JAXA ) , which have been tracking Arctic ice levels by satellite since 1978 .
By their calculation , an amount of ice equal to the Japanese archipelago has been lost in just the last 3 years .
According to the Japanese agencies , there could be several reasons why the ice levels are so low this year .
One explanation is that ice in coastal areas which is more prone to melting could have entered the Arctic Sea .
It ’s also possible that melting within the Arctic Sea has quickened – thanks to global warming – and is leading to the ocean absorbing more sunlight .
Finally , they suggest that more sea ice could have drifted from the Arctic Sea to the warmer Atlantic Ocean and melted .
Here ’s the scary part .
The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicted that this level of ice coverage would be met in 2050 .
I ’ll say that again , Arctic ice will reach levels predicted for 2050 by the end of this summer .
I wonder what the levels will be in 2050 ?
Here ’s what one official had to say about the IPCC predictions :
The IPCC forecast cannot adequately explain what is now happening in the Arctic Sea .

Today , I noticed a new paper on the relationship between the demonstrated health benefits of calorie restriction and autophagy , the process by which cells recycle damaged organelles ( such as the increasingly important mitochondria ) and other components .
More efficient autophagy is generally considered to be a good thing for all the obvious quality control reasons - newly created , functional cellular components are better than old , malfunctioning cellular components .
Autophagy is Required for Dietary Restriction - Mediated Life Span Extension in C. elegans :
Dietary restriction extends life span in diverse species including Caenorhabditis elegans .
However , the downstream cellular targets regulated by dietary restriction are largely unknown .
Autophagy , an evolutionary conserved lysosomal degradation pathway , is induced under starvation conditions and regulates life span in insulin signaling C. elegans mutants .
We now report that two essential autophagy genes ( bec - 1 and Ce- atg7 ) are required for the longevity phenotype of the C. elegans dietary restriction mutant ( eat - 2 ( ad1113 ) animals .
Thus , we propose that autophagy mediates the effect , not only of insulin signaling , but also of dietary restriction on the regulation of C. elegans life span .
Since autophagy and longevity control are highly conserved from C. elegans to mammals , a similar role for autophagy in dietary restriction - mediated life span extension may also exist in mammals .
The work is in nematodes rather than people , but most interesting .
If you look back into the Longevity Meme archives , you 'll see a few references to calorie restriction and autophagy in mammals .
The focus there was to understand to what degree increased autophagy causes the health and longevity benefits of calorie restriction - such as by culling the numbers of damaged mitochondria and thus reducing their deleterious effect on the rest of the body :
I believe this is the first I 've seen of the suggestion that autophagy is strictly necessary for the benefits of calorie restriction in any way .
One can speculate as to whether that raises the profile of the role of mitochondrial damage in age - related disease and degeneration - but there 's a lot more research yet to be done here .
Fortunately , research groups around the world are converging on the biochemistry of calorie restriction from all sorts of directions : autophagy ; sirtuins ; other likely pathways ; the immune system ; studies in worms , flies , mice , monkeys and people .
Today 's mysteries wo n't last much past 2012 , I 'd wager - a lot of money is flowing into this field .

A federal judge has ordered a hearing on whether the Bush administration violated a court order by destroying CIA interrogation videos of two al - Qaida suspects .
U.S. District Judge Henry H. Kennedy rejected calls from the Justice Department to stay out of the matter .
He ordered lawyers to appear before him Friday morning .
In June 2005 , Kennedy ordered the administration to safeguard " all evidence and information regarding the torture , mistreatment , and abuse of detainees now at the United States Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay . "
Five months later , the CIA destroyed the interrogation videos .
The recordings involved suspected terrorists Abu Zubaydah and Abd al - Rahim al - Nashiri .
The Justice Department argued that the videos were n't covered by the order because the two men were being held in secret CIA prisons overseas , not at the Guantanamo Bay prison .
Another week , another ado over nothing .
Last Saturday , Steve McIntyre wrote an email to NASA GISS pointing out that for some North American stations in the GISTEMP analysis , there was an odd jump in going from 1999 to 2000 .
On Monday , the people who work on the temperature analysis ( not me ) , looked into it and found that this coincided with the switch between two sources of US temperature data .
There had been a faulty assumption that these two sources matched , but that turned out not to be the case .
There were in fact a number of small offsets ( of both sign ) between the same stations in the two different data sets .
The obvious fix was to make an adjustment based on a period of overlap so that these offsets disappear .
This was duly done by Tuesday , an email thanking McIntyre was sent and the data analysis ( which had been due in any case for the processing of the July numbers ) was updated accordingly along with an acknowledgment to McIntyre and update of the methodology .
The net effect of the change was to reduce mean US anomalies by about 0.15 ºC for the years 2000 - 2006 .
There were some very minor knock on effects in earlier years due to the GISTEMP adjustments for rural vs. urban trends .
In the global or hemispheric mean , the differences were imperceptible ( since the US is only a small fraction of the global area ) .
There were however some very minor re-arrangements in the various rankings ( see data [ As it existed in Sep 2007 ] ) .
Specifically , where 1998 ( 1.24 ºC anomaly compared to 1951 - 1980 ) had previously just beaten out 1934 ( 1.23 ºC ) for the top US year , it now just misses : 1934 1.25 ºC vs. 1998 1.23 ºC .
None of these differences are statistically significant .
Indeed in the 2001 paper describing the GISTEMP methodology ( which was prior to this particular error being introduced ) , it says :
The U.S. annual ( January - December ) mean temperature is slightly warmer in 1934 than in 1998 in the GISS analysis ( Plate 6 ) .
This contrasts with the USHCN data , which has 1998 as the warmest year in the century .
In both cases the difference between 1934 and 1998 mean temperatures is a few hundredths of a degree .
The main reason that 1998 is relatively cooler in the GISS analysis is its larger adjustment for urban warming .
In comparing temperatures of years separated by 60 or 70 years the uncertainties in various adjustments ( urban warming , station history adjustments , etc. ) lead to an uncertainty of at least 0.1°C .
Thus it is not possible to declare a record U.S. temperature with confidence until a result is obtained that exceeds the temperature of 1934 by more than 0.1°C .
More importantly for climate purposes , the longer term US averages have not changed rank .
2002 -2006 ( at 0.66 ºC ) is still warmer than 1930 - 1934 ( 0.63 ºC – the largest value in the early part of the century ) ( though both are below 1998 - 2002 at 0.79 º C ) .
( The previous version – up to 2005 – can be seen here ) .
In the global mean , 2005 remains the warmest ( as in the NCDC analysis ) .
CRU has 1998 as the warmest year but there are differences in methodology , particularly concerning the Arctic ( extrapolated in GISTEMP , not included in CRU ) which is a big part of recent global warmth .
No recent IPCC statements or conclusions are affected in the slightest .
Sum total of this change ?
A couple of hundredths of degrees in the US rankings and no change in anything that could be considered climatically important ( specifically long term trends ) .
However , there is clearly a latent and deeply felt wish in some sectors for the whole problem of global warming to be reduced to a statistical quirk or a mistake .
This led to some truly death - defying leaping to conclusions when this issue hit the blogosphere .
One of the worst examples ( but there are others ) was the ‘ Opinionator ’ at the New York Times ( oh dear ) .
He managed to confuse the global means with the continental US numbers , he made up a story about McIntyre having ‘ always puzzled about some gaps ’ ( what ? ) , declared the the error had ‘ played havoc ’ with the numbers , and quoted another blogger saying that the ‘ astounding ’ numbers had been ‘ silently released ’ .
None of these statements are true .
Among other incorrect stories going around are that the mistake was due to a Y2 K bug or that this had something to do with photographing weather stations .
Again , simply false .
But hey , maybe the Arctic will get the memo .
Tendulkar went on the attack during his brief spell at the crease
The 34 - year - old is fit for the Boxing Day Test in Melbourne having missed the final match of the 1 - 0 series win over Pakistan with a knee injury .
" Despite the practice game being rained off , we 've come with some Test cricket behind us which is important , " he said .
" We are geared up to win and ready to put on a good show . "
Tendulkar , the second all - time highest Test run-scorer behind West Indian Brian Lara , said a victory over Australia would be the crowning glory of his magnificent 18 - year career , but insisted he was not yet thinking of retiring .

Ganguly has shown that he really means business
beautifulVinod
The " Little Master " , who has scored four centuries from 12 Test matches down under , says he is keen to beat the top - ranked Aussies on their home ground for the first time .
" It would be the most important tour ever if we can pull it off .
Beating Australia is the ultimate for us , " he said .
" For the past 18 years I have been living my dream and every day is a special one and when we walk out on 26 December it will be a terrific occasion .
" I have not thought about retiring and I just want to enjoy this tour and bat well .
That is my focus . "
Wicket - keeper Mahendra Dhoni ( knee ) has also been declared fit for Melbourne , having also missed out in Bangalore because of an ankle problem .
Only 48 overs were possible as rain blighted the three - day tour game against Victoria - the only warm - up match before the first of four Tests .

This is part of a photography project I 've been working on for the past few weeks for my Multimedia class .
We were supposed to tell a story using photos .
I decided to tell a love story between fruit .
These photos are some of my favorites from the project .
If you can't tell what 's going on , we follow our Orange friend as he comes home to find his girlfriend 's " clothes " scattered around the floor .
He then proceeds to catch her in bed with a handsome banana .
After that , even his friends can't console him .
He drowns his sorrows in nicotine and liquor .
Do n't worry .
It all ends well .
Each piece of fruit was hand - painted with black tempera to get the facial expressions .
The eyes were bought at an art supply store .
I think they 're teddy bear eyes or something .
I would have liked to post the whole project , but there 's over 50 shots in it , so ... meh .

Top General defends seeming underestimation of US troop deaths in Iraq Michael Roston
Published : Thursday May 31 , 2007 Print This Email
This VoteVets chairman criticizes Pentagon 's explanation After the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff appeared to significantly underestimate the number of US armed service members killed in the Iraq War on Memorial Day , a spokesman for his office defended his remarks in an interview with RAW STORY .
General Peter Pace meant in his Memorial Day media appearance to distinguish between US troops killed in action and the hundreds who who have died from ' non- hostile ' causes in the Iraqi theater of combat .
" You only have a few minutes when you 're doing short interviews on morning shows , and General Pace was trying to be very precise , " Lieutenant Colonel Gary Tallman from the Public Affairs Office of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said Wednesday .
" He was referring to American service members killed in action as of May 25 , which at that date was 2815 , and there additionally have been 619 non -hostile deaths , and that puts you over 3,400 . "
Pace had appeared to say that fewer than 3,000 US soldiers died since the US invaded Iraq in 2003 .
" When you take a look at the life of a nation and all that 's required to keep us free , we had more than 3,000 Americans murdered on 11 September , 2001 .
The number who have died , sacrificed themselves since that time is approaching that number , " he said in the CBS News performance on Monday morning , which RAW STORY reported later in the day .
The remark was criticized by one Iraqi veterans group .
" Memorial Day is a time to remember anyone who lost their lives in military service to this nation .
The ultimate sacrifice doesnt discriminate as to whether a hero is a combat death or non-combat , " said Jon Soltz , the Chairman of VoteVets.org , a political action committee that supports veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars who are running for public office .
" All those who gave their lives deserve to be treated with equal honor and respect .
It s simply wrong to leave out those who were non-combat deaths in Iraq and Afghanistan when speaking of those who gave their lives in service to the nation . "
Spokesman admits General 's remark ' made us say hmmm ...'
Lt. Col . Tallman admitted in the interview with RAW STORY that even General Pace 's staff was surprised by the remark that he made in the appearance with Harry Smith .
" Col. Haddock [ another Joint Chiefs spokesperson ] spoke to him about that specifically afterwards , and he said , ' That made us say '' hmmmm ... , '' that made us stop and think , because the media reports well over 3,000 , and the Office of the Secretary of Defense reports everything , ' " Tallman explained .
But , apparently Pace defended himself to his staff .
" He said 'no , no , I 'm right .
I 'm speaking to those who were killed in action , ' " Tallman added .
As of Wednesday , the Iraq Casualty Count database RAW STORY had earlier used showed 618 US armed services members had died of ' non- hostile causes . '
A count showed that 52 had died of a number of health - related causes .
Additionally , 48 had died of ' non- hostile ' causes without any particular explanation in the Iraq Casualty Count database , 2 had died of ' non- hostile - not reported , ' and 29 had died from ' non-hostile - unspecified cause . '
A sizable number of the remainder had died from vehicle accidents , or helicopter crashes .
Additional so - called ' non- hostile deaths ' included a variety of subcategories : accidental overdose ; airplane crash ; building fire ; drowning ; electrocution ; homicide ; heatstroke ; lost at sea ; maintenance accident ; ordnance accident ; suicide ; weapons discharge ; and , weapon malfunction .
The spokesperson insisted to RAW STORY that General Pace was not discounting the ' sacrifice , ' as he said in the interview , of those who died from these so - called ' non- hostile ' causes .
" Not at all , he 's not trying to underestimate or downplay the circumstances of any fatalities .
There have been heart attacks , and some folks have gotten sick , and they did so in the line of duty for their country , and it 's catastrophic for their families , " Lt. Col .
Tallman insisted .
" General Pace felt that and he 's conveyed that , but the way question the was asked , as he read it , he was trying to be precise . "
However , Tallman had no explanation as to why it was so important for the Joint Chiefs Chairman to emphasize those who were killed as opposed to those who died under other circumstances .
" I ca n't speak for him specifically , " the spokesman said .
California voters are inclined to support a proposed ballot initiative that would change how the Golden State allocates its electoral votes in presidential campaigns , but they 're not yet sold on the idea , a Field Poll released today showed .
Currently , California employs a winner - take - all system that awards the state 's entire 55 electoral votes to the winner of the state 's popular vote .
Under the proposed measure , which could be on the June 2008 ballot , the presidential election would become , in essence , a congressional district - by - congressional district contest .
The winner of the statewide popular vote would receive two electoral votes , but the remaining votes would go to the winner in each of the 53 congressional districts .
The proponents of the California ballot measure , largely Republicans , say such a change would make presidential elections more fair by more accurately reflecting the results of the popular vote .
However , Democrats have railed against the proposal by charging that the measure is a Republican - driven effort to keep Democrats from capturing the White House .
If the proposal is adopted , analysts suggest that a Republican presidential candidate would get a boost because Democrats can no longer count on all 55 electoral votes from California , which has voted for Democratic candidates since 1988 .
All but two states , Nebraska and Maine , give their electoral votes on a winner - take - all basis to the presidential candidate who wins the statewide popular vote .
The Field Poll found that 47 percent of registered voters back a change to California 's system for electoral votes , with 35 percent opposed .
Republicans generally support the change more than Democrats .
When pollsters explained the political implication that Democratic presidential candidates might lose some electoral votes under a proportional system , the numbers changed : 49 percent supported the change and 42 percent opposed it .
Opposition from Democrats and independent voters rose when the issue was put this way .

Still , the survey showed there is " initial support for the idea to change the California 's system , " said Mark DiCamillo , director of the Field Poll .
" I think voters on both sides tend to see the current winner - take - all to be a little bit unfair , " he said .
" Even the Democrats in the first question ( before political ramifications were explained ) were nearly evenly divided . "
The poll of 536 registered voters taken Aug. 3 -12 has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.5 percentage points .
With California 's 55 electoral votes representing the biggest single chunk of votes in the presidential election , the proposed initiative - should it make the ballot - will generate a huge partisan campaign fight .
" And I think there would be more involvement from outside the state than we 've ever seen in any other initiative in California , " DiCamillo said .
Even though the proponents of the measure have yet to begin gathering signatures , the battle lines have already been drawn .
The proposal for the measure was filed by Thomas Hiltachk , a managing partner at the state Republican Party 's primary law firm , Bell , McAndrews & Hiltachk .
A representative for the proponents of the measure said the results of the latest Field Poll are encouraging .
" It shows that without much ( campaigning ) ... there 's a gut - level notion that this is the fair way of doing things , " said Kevin Eckery , a spokesman for Californians for Equal Representation , a committee recently set up to push the measure .
However , the state 's Democrats argue that the proposal is nothing but a " right - wing power grab . "
" Republicans are in disarray nationally right now .
And in California , they are n't even treading water .
They 'll do everything they can to steal the White House in 2008 .
Our job is to make sure that we take it seriously and do everything we can to kill it , " said Roger Salazar , a spokesman for the California Democratic Party .
Mark is not the only one .
The British Medical Association believes that a growing number of healthy people in this country are illicitly using brain - boosting drugs that should really only be taken on prescription .
More specifically , they 're taking modafinil and Ritalin , a drug licensed for use in those suffering from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) .
Some people may find a way to obtain the drugs from a doctor , but if not , they are available from websites based abroad .
The going rate for a dose is around £ 3 .
Although the scale of the problem is as yet undefined in this country , there is evidence that self - dosing with brain - boosting drugs is already rife in the United States .
There 's thought to be a particular problem among students ( some of whom have nicknamed Ritalin " Vitamin R " ) : in a survey of 1,025 students at a north - eastern US university , published in the Journal of American College Health last year , one in six of those who responded admitted taking prescription drugs illicitly , mainly to improve concentration and alertness .
But even beyond the world of student panic , abuse of Ritalin ( also known as " kiddie coke " ) is widespread .
Meanwhile many millions of people who have problems with tiredness - truckers , for example , and night workers - are using modafinil .
It 's even been found in the systems of top American athletes during dope testing .
The BMA is so concerned about the use of such drugs on this side of the Atlantic that its medical ethics committee is today publishing a discussion paper on the ethics of cognitive - enhancement .
The paper predicts that increasing use of Ritalin and modafinil in Britain is " both imminent and inevitable " .
One of the experts who produced the report , Barbara Sahakian , professor of neuropsychology at Cambridge University , knows at first - hand how widely used the drugs already are .
" I have been offered modafinil on several occasions when I 've been at conferences , without asking for it , " she says .
" My fellow academics have taken it to counteract jetlag and tiredness , and I 've been offered it when I 've complained about my own jet lag , or having been allocated a slot to talk late in the day .
I have n't taken it - I work in the lab where we have many of these substances , so it would be unethical for me to be taking things off the shelves .
But the use of these drugs is clearly quite widespread within the profession . "
Such anecdotal evidence is n't hard to uncover ; these are the sort of drugs that students talk about nowadays .
Anna , 24 , now a junior doctor , says that her use of prescription drugs to boost her ability to work was unexceptional while she was studying medicine at a Scottish university .
" We 'd have these revision parties .
It was usually about three of us , we'd get wired on Ritalin , and I 'd do my anatomy revision , another would work on her economics coursework , and the other would do a history of art essay .
We 'd sit there working like mad , really racing through it , totally focused , turning out good quality work for hours and hours .
" I ended up taking Ritalin in every exam during the first semester at medical school - I was just so snowed under that I could n't cope with the work otherwise , and I was positive I was going to fail .
I remember in the exam that I was pulling in knowledge from when I was at school .
It all seemed to come into my head much better than it would normally - it might just have been psychosomatic , but it felt like it helped .
And I passed every exam . "
Dosing up on stimulants to improve focus and ward off tiredness is nothing new .
Caffeine , amphetamines and other , harder drugs have long been used by people seeking ways to make their brains work better , for longer .
The difference with modern drugs such as Ritalin - which is actually an amphetamine , but far more subtle than old - fashioned " speed " - is that they have been developed to minimise both unpleasant side - effects and the risk of addiction .
Ritalin , the trade name in the UK for the drug methylphenidate , was invented in 1954 and first prescribed to ADHD sufferers in the 1960s , but its use rocketed during the 90s .
In the US , doctors write 3 m prescriptions for the drug every month ; here doctors average more than 30,000 a month .
Although Ritalin is medically a stimulant , it calms those who suffer from ADHD , making them more able to concentrate on the task in hand , and has similar effects on healthy users ( although it can also cause insomnia , headaches and heart palpitations . )
The fact that it 's currently so widely prescribed to even very young children makes many adults think that it must be perfectly safe to take .
Modafinil , meanwhile , has been prescribed in the UK since 1997 , and has similar effects , but it also works to stave off tiredness without the slight euphoric high and cardiovascular effects brought on by Ritalin , which can be dangerous for those with weak hearts .
Neither drug is considered addictive at the doses normally prescribed - although it is possible to develop a psychological dependence .
Sahakian and a team of researchers at Cambridge tested modafinil on healthy male undergraduates in 2003 .
Those who took a single 200 mg dose were found to use information more efficiently within two hours of taking it .
They were better at mental planning tests , completed puzzles more accurately , could remember longer strings of digits and recognise pictures more quickly .
Long - term memory was not enhanced , but the increased ability to concentrate for longer periods of time would , the researchers say , allow them to learn more .
Modafinil has also been tested by both the British and American armed forces , and could one day offer a substitute for the caffeine and amphetamine " go pills " the US army and air force have long relied on for night - time operations .
But the new BMA paper emphasises that the long - term side - effects of using such drugs are unknown : they may turn out to be harmful .
Such risks may be worthwhile for those suffering from the conditions the drugs were created to treat , but perhaps not for a healthy user .
The report highlights speculation among academics that there could be particular dangers for children and younger people who take the drugs while their brains are developing , and that people who use cognitive - enhancing pharmaceuticals in their youth may become more susceptible to premature cognitive decline as they age .
" We simply do not know what the long - term effect of the use of such drugs in healthy populations will be , " the report concludes .
Whether or not the drugs should be so widely prescribed , especially to primary school children , is a matter of some controversy .
But it seems clear that healthy young adults are taking a gamble when they dabble with them .
This may not be enough to put everyone off .
Modafinil 's apparent harmlessness persuaded John , who is studying for a neuroscience PhD in London , to try it .
" When I was thinking about taking modafinil , I read the scientific studies , " the 29 - year - old says .
" I 've never even taken cannabis , let alone any harder drugs , but I thought modafinil might benefit me .
Sometimes I find it hard to concentrate , some days I 'm just tired out and I need to work .
A friend who 's a doctor wrote me a prescription - he uses it occasionally himself .
I 've also bought it off the internet .
For me , it 's something to have in the medicine cupboard in case you 're totally exhausted and just need to get through the day .
I only use it maybe once or twice a month - it 's just a nice backup .
It does n't feel like much , it just stops you from feeling sleepy , takes away that mid-afternoon drop - off .
You certainly would n't take it for enjoyment , for its own sake .
I do n't notice any side - effects - sometimes my mouth goes a bit dry , but that 's all . "
The idea of competing with pharmaceutically enhanced peers at work or university will strike many as deeply unfair .
" It may not be a fair thing that I took modafinil , " Mark says , " but so many students have Ritalin and other drugs , some who have been prescribed it for more or less spurious reasons , or others who can just get hold of it one way or another .
Loads of students I knew were using it to stay up and write essays .
And at that particular time , this particular drug seemed quite helpful to me , so I did n't feel too bad about taking it . "
And the playing field is n't exactly level anyway , since many students will be legitimately prescribed drugs by doctors even if their peers might not consider them ill .
" Prescribing Ritalin for ADHD brings a grey area , " Sahakian says .
" It 's a spectrum disorder , and while at one end it can be deeply debilitating , many people are diagnosed for much more minor symptoms .
Studies in America have shown a huge variation in diagnosis rates - in some areas up to one in five children have it prescribed to them .
The line between enhancement and treatment is a subjective decision , and if students have found someone who will prescribe where other doctors might not , then they are already going into exams on drugs , where other students , with similar symptoms , are not .
The pressure to compete is already boosting prescribed use of these drugs - we hear about parents putting pressure on doctors to prescribe Ritalin because they think that everyone else 's children are taking it .
" And maybe people who have the money will be able to afford cognitive - enhancing drugs that are n't prescribed - so people who are already limited in finances and background will be even more disadvantaged .
But then that 's already the case , as they can afford better education , better food , more extra-curricular lessons . "
Trevor Robbins , professor of neuroscience at Cambridge University , who has carried out extensive research on drugs for cognitive enhancement and on drug abuse , is surprisingly sanguine about the use of these drugs by healthy adults .
" We already enhance our performance in all sorts of ways , " he says .
" Some of us wear contact lenses , some of us drink coffee .
Some may be horrified that normal people would take drugs to improve their performance , but if you called it a food or a drink , they would n't bat an eyelid - people take fish oil because it may make their brains work better , but drugs have a stigma to them .
" I do n't really see any argument against self - improvement in itself , except in a competitive situation - in exams , for example .
Then it 's analogous with doping in competitive sport .
But what can you do ?
Even if you do drug tests in the exam hall , people might have used modafinil to improve their learning on a course in November , for instance , then taken the exam in July .
How are you going to test it by then ? "
Both Robbins and Sahakian believe that the use of the drugs is set to grow , no matter what regulation is put in place .
The BMA report concurs , acknowledging that even if the drugs were banned in Britain , it would take international laws to prevent them from being sold over the internet .
And right now there are more mind - sharpening medicines in development , and those who want to enhance their mental performance may soon be able to choose , legally or illegally , from a wider range of drugs , each operating on different parts of the brain .
The Alzheimer 's drug Donepezil , for example , has been shown to delay loss of mental ability in patients , and improve memory in those without dementia .
Early clinical trials , meanwhile , suggest that a new and so far unlicensed class of drugs , ampakines , may enhance learning capacity and memory in healthy users , as well as increasing attention span and alertness .
Drugs may not negate the need for talent , creativity and self - discipline in achieving success .
But even if the ethics and the uncertainties about long - term risks are hard to swallow , more and more people may soon find themselves tempted by the chance to be sharper , smarter and more alert if it's on offer in tablet form .

Boehner ’s idea had been that the GOP could lift itself off the mat by borrowing from private - sector marketing concepts .
Republicans can't agree on new image
An effort by House Republicans to “ re-brand ” their battered party with a new agenda and a new strategy to sell it has fallen behind schedule as GOP leaders try to referee ideological and tactical disputes among their members .
House Minority Leader John A. Boehner ( Ohio ) began the project to refurbish House Republicans ’ scuffed public image at the start of the year , amid widespread expectations among lawmakers that the results would be ready for public rollout this fall .

As it now stands , according to members and well - connected staff aides , the debut could happen as late as next spring , after the presidential primaries .
Boehner ’s idea had been that the GOP could lift itself off the mat by borrowing from private - sector marketing concepts .
Among those who have consulted in the effort were corporate brand experts such as Richard Costello , the man behind GE ’s famous “ We Bring Good Things to Life ” campaign .
But modern business techniques have stalled amid old - fashioned political disputes .
Lawmakers who think the party needs to embrace a more moderate image on issues like health care and the environment are at odd with conservatives , who believe the way back to victory is to reclaim the GOP ’s traditional reputation for taking a hard line on spending .
Some of the divisions are about the language and style of the GOP ’s public positioning .
A survey polling House GOP members found many eager to “ fight ” and “ attack ” Democratic initiatives , while others favored a more accommodationist public image .
Part of the split is generational .
During a retreat last winter , Rep. Scott Garrett of New Jersey polled his GOP colleagues about what direction they favored for the party .
Seventy - eight percent of the members who have served one or two terms favored a conservative agenda .
That number dropped 20 percentage points for lawmakers who had served three to five terms .
And , of the Republicans who have been in the House more than 12 years , 47 percent favored conservative politics , compared with the 26 percent who preferred a more moderate agenda .
“ Most of the younger members campaigned on a conservative platform , so they ’re excited about trying to implement that , ” Garrett said .
The re-branding effort flows from conversations Boehner was leading about how to refashion the GOP ’s image that began even before Republicans were bounced from their congressional majorities a year ago this week .
At a retreat not long after that humiliation , former Rep. Tom DeLay — whose legal and political problems helped contribute to the defeat — challenged his old colleagues to unveil a new agenda that the party could use to fight Democrats on more favorable political terrain .
But the obstacles Boehner is facing in the re-branding effort are a reflection of his broader challenges trying to revive a divided and demoralized party .
Some conservative members are complaining that too many Republicans voted for the expansion of a popular state - run children ’s health care initiative that the president and party leaders opposed .
And some GOP lawmakers argue that time is running short to come up with a coherent , partywide issue strategy to take into the 2008 elections .
“ We have an opening , but it ’s going to close in February , ” said Rep. Paul Ryan ( R - Wis. ) , who unveiled a conservative agenda last week with the help of some GOP colleagues in the House and Senate .
Boehner tasked Republican Conference Chairman Adam Putnam of Florida with the communications efforts and Rep. Thaddeus G. McCotter of Michigan with developing the actual policy behind this drive .
In borrowing from corporate image - building methods , the goal is for individual lawmakers to present themselves as the personification of the party , just as employees at IBM or Google are encouraged to present themselves as public ambassadors for the companies where they work .
But first , lawmakers must settle on just what the GOP brand is supposed to be .
Conservatives have been the vanguard for the GOP since Newt Gingrich and his band of Republican rebels — including Boehner — stormed to power in 1994 .
Conservatives now dominate the party on both a congressional and presidential level .
Moderates , meanwhile , say that one benefit of reduced power is greater freedom — now that leaders no longer have the leverage to force them to take unpopular votes .
But many say they remain concerned about the direction of the party , even though their numbers diminished in the last election .
“ The bottom line is that if Republicans are going to be in the majority , you need moderate members , ” said Rep. Mike Castle ( Del. ) .
“ I ca n’t win my election with just Republican votes , ” said Rep. Jim Gerlach ( Pa. ) .
That dynamic has prompted the third - term lawmaker to embrace issues that play with voters on both sides of the aisle , such as the environment , health care and a balanced budget .
Minority status , he said , allows him to position himself as an outsider rather than have to defend the party in charge .
“ We ’re all running as challengers in our districts , ” Gerlach said .
“ That gives us a little more of an advantage to run against the institution . ”
McCotter , who helms the Republican Policy Committee , led the efforts to address each policy issue that would make up the GOP ’s new brand .
Sitting in his office on the sixth floor of the Longworth House Office Building , surrounded by glass - enclosed bookcases jampacked with titles , the Michigan Republican referred to the branding project as “ an independent work study . ”
“ I ’m like the college professor who can assign you homework but ca n’t force you to turn it in , ” he said .
“ But they ’re turning it in anyways . ”
His team is in the process of melding those results with Putnam ’s branding team .
Leadership staff walked rank - and - file chiefs of staff through the process during a retreat late last week on Maryland ’s Eastern Shore .
But leaders have decided to postpone their rollout until next year , in part because of disagreements and in part because the calendar is already too cluttered for the balance of this , senior aides said .
Aides expect to complete their work by the member retreat next January .
Whatever the stumbles for his own team , McCotter argued , there is still more unity in GOP ranks than among Democrats .
The GOP , after all , has plenty of small issues over which lawmakers and their grass - roots supporters are divided , such as the stem cell debate , but party loyalists tend to rally around bigger issues , such as lower taxes and strong national security .
“ I can get Mike Castle and [ conservative ]
Mike Pence in a room and come up with something that both of them will agree on , ” McCotter said , adding that it is often impossible to bridge the divides on the Democratic side between liberals and moderates .
“ How do you get Sheila Jackson Lee [ D - Texas ] and Collin Peterson [ D - Minn . ] in a room and come up with something they can agree on ? ”
I ’ll never think of that ring the same way again … [ digg - reddit - me ]

Bridges were targeted in overnight raids on south Lebanon
Enlarge Image
Israeli warships have blocked Lebanese ports , and its international airport was closed after Israeli bombing .
A Lebanese cabinet minister said the Israeli response was disproportionate , and called for a ceasefire .
Raids on targets across south Lebanon have killed at least 35 .
Two have died in Hezbollah attacks on Israel .
The operation comes as Israel continues a separate offensive in the Gaza Strip .
An Israeli soldier was captured there last month .
The offensive in Lebanon follows a day of heavy fighting in which the Israelis suffered their worst losses on the border for several years .
Eight soldiers were killed and two were injured , in addition to the two captured in a Hezbollah ambush .
The captured men have now been named as Ehud Goldwasser , 31 , and Eldad Regev , 26 .
Hezbollah guerrillas also fired volleys of rockets at the northern Israeli coastal town of Nahariya , killing one Israeli and injuring 14 others .
They also fired seven rockets at the town of Safed , 15 km ( 9 miles ) inside the Israeli border , injuring 11 people .
One woman later died of her wounds .
Hezbollah has threatened to attack the Israeli port city of Haifa if Israel bombs Beirut .
Israel has warned people in the Lebanese capital 's southern suburbs to evacuate .
But it is not clear whether Haifa , which is 30 km ( 19 miles ) from the Israeli border , is within range of Hezbollah 's rockets .
The Israeli army says several rockets have landed more than 20 km ( 12 miles ) south of the border , suggesting that Hezbollah has managed to extend their range .
Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev told the BBC that Israel was responding to " an unprovoked act of aggression " by Lebanon .
But Lebanese minister Naila Mouawad said Israel had responded disproportionately .
The Lebanese government wanted a ceasefire , she said , calling for the two captured soldiers to be returned to Israel .
US President George Bush described Hezbollah as a " group of terrorists who want to stop the advance of peace " .
Speaking in Germany , he said Israel had the right to defend itself , but its action should not weaken the Lebanese government .
France and Russia condemned Israel 's " disproportionate use of force " .
Blockade
An Israeli military spokesman said Israeli naval ships had entered Lebanese waters to block the transfer of " terrorists and weapons to the terror organisations operating in Lebanon " .

Earlier , three missiles hit runways at Beirut airport , the country 's only international airport , forcing its closure .
Flights have been diverted to Cyprus .
An Israeli army spokesman said the airport was used to supply weapons to Hezbollah .
The blockade follows wide - ranging Israeli air raids on southern Lebanon , which killed at least 35 civilians .
Among the dead were two whole families - one of 10 people and one of seven - killed in the homes near the town of Nabatiyeh , officials said .
The Hezbollah television station al - Manar in southern Beirut was also hit , injuring three .
Responsibility
Israel said its jets hit 40 Hezbollah targets .

Lebanon timeline Who are Hezbollah ?
Beirut is largely cut off from southern Lebanon after Israeli missiles and bombs hit key roads and bridges , correspondents say .
Israel has said it holds Lebanon responsible for the soldiers ' capture and views it as an " act of war " .
Hezbollah has said the captured soldiers will not be returned without a release deal for Palestinian , Lebanese and other Arab prisoners held in Israeli jails .
Lebanese Prime Minister Fuad Siniora denied any knowledge of the Hezbollah operation and refused to take responsibility for the soldiers ' capture .
Hezbollah 's political wing is a significant force in Lebanese politics and has one government minister , while its powerful military wing has controlled the border zone since Israeli forces pulled out in 2000 .
Volatile mix
Israeli Defence Minister Amir Peretz said Israel would " not allow Hezbollah forces to remain on the borders of the state of Israel " .
One cannot justify the destruction by Israel of the civilian infrastructure in Lebanon and Palestinian territory
Russian government statement
In quotes : World reaction
In Gaza , Israeli jets attacked the Palestinian foreign ministry building in Gaza City , injuring at least 10 people .
Israel has kept up air strikes and other military action against Gaza since the capture of Israeli soldier Cpl Gilad Shalit by Palestinian militants two weeks ago .
The BBC's World Affair 's correspondent Nick Childs says the confrontations in Gaza and Lebanon are ringing alarm bells among world leaders .
He says the combination of an untried and apparently uncertain Israeli government , plus tensions that could easily extend to Syria and Iran , are creating a volatile mixture .
Dec. 27 , 2007  --
In years past , Javona Peters spent Christmas at home with her family , surrounded by gifts and the sounds of caroling .
But this year , the 16 - year - old who dreamed of becoming a nurse spent the holiday in a coma , surrounded , instead , by hospital staff and medical equipment .
Peters has remained in a vegetative state since she came out of what doctors describe as routine brain surgery at Montefiore Medical Center , in New York City on Oct. 17 .
Her lungs work on their own but she has a tube that facilitates breathing .
She receives food through a tube and is unable to hear , see , speak , move , talk , eat or think .
Now , her parents , unmarried and estranged , are battling over the future of their daughter and whether she should remain on life support .
" When you see your kid go into the hospital , and then find out she can't talk or move , it is not a good feeling , " Leonard Peters , who wants his daughter to remain on life support , told ABCNews.com .
Javona 's mother , Janet Joseph , is in court to get full custody of her daughter in order to sue the hospital for malpractice and potentially determine her daughter 's fate .
" It is not up to me to decide who lives and who dies , " Peters said .
" I do n't give life and I do n't take it away . "
Javona lived with her mother in Rhode Island and saw her father about once a month at his home in Mount Vernon , N.Y .
Her mother has filed papers in Bronx Supreme Court to be named her daughter 's guardian .
The hearing , is slated for Jan . 7 .
Both Javona 's parents signed consent forms before the routine procedure , called a ventriculostomy .
The operation , in which doctors drill into the skull to relieve fluid on the brain , generally takes 90 minutes .
The girl was operated on by James Goodrich , director of pediatric surgery at Montefiore , and famous for leading the surgical team that separated conjoined Filipino twins in 2003 .
Two days after the operation , Javona had not awakened , a result , the hospital would eventually say in a statement , of an " unforeseeable reaction to a routine anesthesia agent . "
The family says it was a full three weeks later when the family finally learned the whole story of what happened .
Javona , born with a brain condition , was first treated by Goodrich when she was 3 years old .
Peters said it was days before the family learned Javona would not awaken from the coma .
" The girl is breathing on her own and anything remains possible , " said Montefiore spokesman Steve Osborne .
" The court action will only give the mother the right to sue the hospital . "
Lawyers for Javona 's mother have compared the parents ' legal battle to the seven - year - long dispute between the parents and husband of Terri Schiavo .
Schiavo was on a feeding tube for seven years while her family fought over ending her life support .
In 2005 , Florida courts granted the request of her husband , Michael , to remove the tube .
" You do n't need me to tell you this is a tragedy , " said Ed Gersowitz , a partner in the firm representing Javona 's mother .
" This girl had been living with her mother her whole life , and her mother should determine her fate . "
The mother 's lawyer , Jeff Korek , told the New York Daily News , Wednesday , that " if the father chooses to fight it , and the hospital refuses to honor the mother 's wishes , it could become a case like Terri Schiavo . "
Medical ethicists , however , disagree .
" This case is different , in that Schiavo was an adult , " said Steven Miles , a medical ethicist at the University of Minnesota Center for Bioethics .
Despite being younger than 18 , however , Javona was old enough , Miles said , that she probably expressed wishes about what to do if she was in such a situation , and the courts should take those wishes into account .
" This should n't be a matter of the family members ' beliefs and values , " Miles said .
" In a contest , the decision should go to who speaks with the most loving and intimate knowledge of the daughter . …
The mother may have been the main custodian , but that both parents signed consent forms , speaks to both their involvement . "
Miles added that , in similar cases , 90 percent of adults in intensive care receive medically managed deaths .
The rate is slightly lower for minors , about 85 percent .
Miles also said it can sometimes take days for the effects of brain damage to be fully known , and the hospital may not have intentionally tried to hide information from the family .
In a statement , the hospital called Javona 's condition " completely unexpected , " and said its " medical and nursing teams continue to provide the very best care to Javona . "

Before leaving my last job , I gave it six months to improve .
I wrote a letter to my supervisor asking for a raise , arguing that I was continually doing more work but receiving no additional compensation .
After submitting my request , I made a promise to myself :
At the end of six months , if I had n’t received the raise as requested then I would quit my job .
The time came , and I quit .
Looking back on it now , I know it was the right decision .
After two years with the organization , it was time to quit .
Here ’s why :
The above graph represents the relationship that existed between the amount of work I was doing on the job and my income while working there .
Since I earned salary , my income was constant .
Since I am proactive by nature , I took on additional projects outside of my job description .
The result ?
Being taken advantage of by my employer for two years .
Now , this was n’t my employer ’s fault — we just were n’t the best match for each other .
The job was definitely more suited for someone that would take the “ do the least amount of work possible without getting fired ” approach .
Consequently , my “ go getter ” approach did n’t fit in .
Having failed to realize this , I worked hard expecting a raise that would never manifest .
Strangely , the other thing I failed to realize was that getting a raise would n’t actually help me :
As shown in this second graph , getting a raise would ’ve only corrected my situation temporarily .
A larger income would result in larger amounts of work , meaning it would n’t be long before the additional work exceeded the value of the raise .
In other words , the raise would only satisfy me for a finite amount of time before I was in the same position of being taken advantage of .
Readers with business sense are probably thinking “ What do you mean , being taken advantage of ?
That ’s how business is designed to work — the business pays you less than they plan to earn from you . ”
My point is that I do n’t fit the standard business model .
I do n’t like being told what to do , I get bored quickly when I ’m not doing something challenging , and I like earning income that is a direct result of how hard I worked for it .
In other words , I do n’t like the traditional idea of working — trading time for money seems inefficient , especially when there are more things I want to do with my time besides work .
After coming to terms with this , I ’m grateful that my request for a raise was refused .
If I had received the raise , I would n’t have quit when I did .
I would ’ve stayed around until the temporary satisfaction expired — and further stifled the entrepreneur in me .
Once I made the decision to quit , I moved to another state with a plan to reinvent myself .
Instead of looking to work for someone else , I began working for myself .
I started writing original articles for LifeReboot , and I made another promise to myself :
In six months , if my site was n’t earning an average of $ 10 a day , then I ’d give up my entrepreneurial adventure and look for more traditional work .
In the first month , LifeReboot earned $ 0 .
The second month , it earned $ 42 . ( Average $ 1.40 / day )
The third , $ 126 . ( Average $ 4.20 / day )
The fourth , $ 171 . ( Average $ 5.70 / day )
The fifth is n’t over yet , and has already earned $ 286 .
( Average $ 9.53 / day )
( Edit : LifeReboot ’s Current Monthly Earnings are available in this article . )
If the trend continues , then I will undoubtedly reach the six month goal that I aimed for .
If the trend continues for years , then I will have succeeded in discovering a way to earn income working smarter instead of harder :
If you were given a choice of how you ’d like the relationship between how hard you work and how much you earn from it , I ’m certain you ’d like something similar to the graph above .
When I sought out an income that takes advantage of exponential growth , I believed I would never achieve it working a traditional job .
Creating six month deadlines for myself have helped me create positive change in my life .
If I had n’t decided to quit my previous job , LifeReboot would still be just an idea in my head .
If I had n’t given LifeReboot a time limit to earn a specific value , I may not have worked as hard as I did .
Now that my original goal is on the horizon , I ’m certain I should n’t give up .
Which brings me to my point : Look around you .
Imagine where current trends will be taking you in the next few years .
If you like where you ’re going , then keep at it — but if you do n’t , then start making some changes .

Researchers at the Picower Institute for Learning and Memory at MIT have , for the first time , reversed symptoms of mental retardation and autism in mice .
The work will be reported in the online early edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences the week of June 25 - 29 .
The mice were genetically manipulated to model Fragile X Syndrome ( FXS ) , the leading inherited cause of mental retardation and the most common genetic cause of autism .
The condition , tied to a mutated X chromosome gene called fragile X mental retardation 1 ( FMR1 ) gene , causes mild learning disabilities to severe autism .
According to the Centers for Disease Control , FXS affects one in 4,000 males and one in 6,000 females of all races and ethnic groups .
The prevalence of autism ranges from one in 500 to one in 166 children .
There is no effective treatment for FXS and other types of autism .
" Our study suggests that inhibiting a certain enzyme in the brain could be an effective therapy for countering the debilitating symptoms of FXS in children , and possibly in autistic kids as well , " said co-author Mansuo L. Hayashi , a former Picower Institute postdoctoral fellow currently at Merck Research Laboratories in Boston .
The study identifies a key enzyme - a chemical reaction - inducing protein - as a possible target for an FXS drug .
The enzyme , called p21 - activated kinase , or PAK , affects the number , size and shape of connections between neurons in the brain .
Halting PAK 's enzymatic activity reversed the structural abnormality of neuronal connections found in the FXS mice , said co-author Susumu Tonegawa , 1987 Nobel laureate and Picower Professor of Biology and Neuroscience .
" Strikingly , PAK inhibition also restored electrical communication between neurons in the brains of the FXS mice , correcting their behavioral abnormalities in the process , " he said .
There are known chemical compounds that inhibit the enzymatic activity of PAK .
These compounds or versions of them may be useful in the future development of drugs for treating FXS , he said .
" These are intriguing findings because the expression of the gene that inhibits PAK occurs in the third week after birth , which means that the neuronal abnormalities in the fragile X mouse are reversed after they appear , " said Eric Klann , a professor at New York University 's Center for Neural Science .
" This is very exciting because it suggests that PAK inhibitors could be used for therapeutic purposes to reverse already established mental impairments in fragile X children . "
Restoring neuronal connections
Tonegawa , Hayashi , MIT graduate student Bridget M. Dolan of the Department of Biology and colleagues study the molecules that govern the formation of neuronal connections in the brain .
They explore how abnormalities in these molecules could interfere with an animal 's behavior .
In the brain , small protrusions called dendritic spines on the branch - like dendrites of one neuron receive chemical signals from other neurons and communicate them to the main cell body .
The numbers and shapes of dendritic spines are key to normal brain function .
FXS patients have higher numbers of dendritic spines in their brains , but each spine is longer and thinner , and transmits weaker electric signals , than those in non-affected individuals .
When the enzymatic activity of PAK was inhibited in the FXS mice , abnormalities in their spine number and structure - as well as the weaker electrical communication between their neurons - were reversed .
Reversing behavioral symptoms
The FXS mice exhibited symptoms similar to those in FXS patients .
These included hyperactivity ; purposeless , repetitive movements reminiscent of autistic people ; attention deficits and difficulty with learning and memory tasks .
" These behavioral abnormalities are ameliorated , partially or fully , by inhibiting the enzymatic activity of PAK , " Tonegawa said .
" Notably , due to an elegant genetic manipulation method employed by the Picower Institute researchers , PAK inhibition in the FXS mice did not take place until a few weeks after appearance of disease symptoms .
This implies that future treatment may still be effective even after symptoms are already pronounced . "
" While future studies will be necessary to further characterize the precise molecular nature of the interaction between PAK and FMR1 , our findings clearly demonstrate that PAK inhibition can counteract several key cellular and behavioral symptoms of FXS , " the authors noted .
In addition to Tonegawa , a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator , Hayashi and Dolan , authors include colleagues at the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences ; the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research in India ; and Seoul National University in Korea .
This work was supported by the FRAXA Foundation , the Simons Foundation , the Wellcome Trust and the National Institutes of Health .

Stanford researchers have found a way to use silicon nanowires to reinvent the rechargeable lithium - ion batteries that power laptops , iPods , video cameras , cell phones , and countless other devices .
The new version , developed through research led by Yi Cui , assistant professor of materials science and engineering , produces 10 times the amount of electricity of existing lithium - ion , known as Li-ion , batteries .
A laptop that now runs on battery for two hours could operate for 20 hours , a boon to ocean - hopping business travelers .
" It 's not a small improvement , " Cui said .
" It 's a revolutionary development . "
The greatly expanded storage capacity could make Li-ion batteries attractive to electric car manufacturers .
Cui suggested that they could also be used in homes or offices to store electricity generated by rooftop solar panels .
" Given the mature infrastructure behind silicon , this new technology can be pushed to real life quickly , " Cui said .
The electrical storage capacity of a Li-ion battery is limited by how much lithium can be held in the battery 's anode , which is typically made of carbon .
Silicon has a much higher capacity than carbon , but also has a drawback .
Silicon placed in a battery swells as it absorbs positively charged lithium atoms during charging , then shrinks during use ( i.e. , when playing your iPod ) as the lithium is drawn out of the silicon .
This expand / shrink cycle typically causes the silicon ( often in the form of particles or a thin film ) to pulverize , degrading the performance of the battery .

Cui 's battery gets around this problem with nanotechnology .
The lithium is stored in a forest of tiny silicon nanowires , each with a diameter one - thousandth the thickness of a sheet of paper .
The nanowires inflate four times their normal size as they soak up lithium .
But , unlike other silicon shapes , they do not fracture .
Research on silicon in batteries began three decades ago .
Candace Chan , a graduate student of Cui , explained : " The people kind of gave up on it because the capacity was n't high enough and the cycle life was n't good enough .
And it was just because of the shape they were using .
It was just too big , and they could n't undergo the volume changes . "
Then , along came silicon nanowires .
" We just kind of put them together , " Chan said .
For their experiments , Chan grew the nanowires on a stainless steel substrate , providing an excellent electrical connection .
" It was a fantastic moment when Candace told me it was working , " Cui said .
Cui said that a patent application has been filed .
He is considering formation of a company or an agreement with a battery manufacturer .
Manufacturing the nanowire batteries would require " one or two different steps , but the process can certainly be scaled up , " he added .
" It 's a well understood process . "
The breakthrough is described in detail in a paper , " High - performance lithium battery anodes using silicon nanowires , " published online Dec. 16 in Nature Nanotechnology , written by Cui , his graduate chemistry student Candace Chan and five others .
Also contributing to the paper in Nature Nanotechnology were Halin Peng and Robert A. Huggins of Materials Science and Engineering at Stanford , Gao Liu of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory , and Kevin McIlwrath and Xiao Feng Zhang of the electron microscope division of Hitachi High Technologies in Pleasanton , Calif .
Earlier this morning Wayan mentioned that G1G1 was going global , if you can provide them with a shipping address within the US or Canada that is .
Additionally this morning OLPC issued a press- release that says that Give 1 , Get 1 has been extended until December , 31st !
Now everyone can have one !
One Laptop per Child ( OLPC ) , a non-profit organization dedicated to providing every child in the world access to new channels of learning , sharing and self - expression , is extending its recently launched Give One Get One program beyond the initial two - week limited time offer through December 31 , 2007 , in the USA and Canada .
The extended period gives people more time to participate in this unique giving program and support the mission of One Laptop per Child .
To date , donations to the Give One Get One program have averaged US $ 2 million per day .
But that press - release also contained another piece of very interesting information : Breaking down that figure reveals that about 5000 donations were made per day , which translates into 5000 " given " machines and 5000 " gotten " machines for a total of ~ 100.000 X0s purchased so far in the past 10 days .
If you extrapolate those number until the end of the year we could see up to around 500.000 X0 sales just via G1G1 .
While that is certainly an outstanding achievement I 'm not quite sure how Quanta ( with mass production apparently having started at 15,000 machines / month ) will be able to keep up with that demand .
Now it will be very interesting to see how long it takes before the first X0s hit the ground !
Update : The Give Many program has also received an update !
While previously donors were only able to designate where 60 % ( Give 100 + ) or 80 % ( 1000 + ) of the of laptops would be sent , with OLPC sending the remaining laptops to a country of their designation , the policy now says :
In each case , the donor designates where the laptops are sent .
While the last version of the " Give Many " policy that I had seen ( Google cached ) indicated that the price was $ 200 per laptop regardless of quantity we 're now back to the previous scheme of Give 100 + @ $ 299 , Give 1000 + @ $ 249 and Give 10,000 + @ $ 199 per laptop .
( Thanks to Bert Freudenberg to pointing this fact out to me ! )
This is definitely a very exciting day for everyone following the OLPC project and my head is still spinning from all the information - talk about a developing story !
What do you make of it ?
Let us know by posting a comment below ...
hmm wow you would think that a person as important as Bush would at least get the newer technology .... i mean ... that thing is HUGE whatever it is ...
It may be a two way radio , but do n't police use the same thing during Drug stingS ? and arent those alot harder to see ?
i think its something totally different , comon .... i just saw the exoskeleton thread ... we can make that but we cant make a 2 way radio less then the size of a briefcase on teh presidents back ( honestly what it reminds me of )
I dont know exactly what it is .. but i think its a big possibility he is wearing a Hearing Aid ...
its also 100 % possible that there is a 2 way radio strapped to his back and is being controlled by somone else ....
It is even possible that that is n't even ol G.W. but a look alike , while the TRUE g.w. talks his speech thru in a safe bunker
then again , anythings possible ... and that hump needs to be looked into
Fox 's Bill Kristol takes ' benign view ' of bridge collapse
Fox News political contributor Bill Kristol , appearing on the August 5 broadcast of Fox News Sunday , made comments minimizing the significance of a bridge collapse in Minnesota last week .
At least five people were killed and 100 injured when the bridge collapsed Wednesday .
" I do n't think this symbolizes any great failure of our infrastructure , " said Kristol .
" Once every twenty five years some bridge falls down unexpectedly due to engineering problems and it is unfortunate obviously but the idea that the whole country is crumbling is not , I think , credible . "
The video can be watched below .
An Indian journalist who secretly filmed right - wing Hindus boasting about the mass murder of Muslims during riots in 2002 in the western state of Gujarat says he now fears for his life .
Reporter Ashish Khetan is also a " very disappointed " man - saying his sting operation that again highlighted the alleged complicity of state officials in the massacres had failed to result in any action being taken .
In addition , Hindu nationalists linked to the killings look set to cruise to re-election in state elections this month .
" I got them to speak to me , make self - damning revelations , details of the killings and rapes , " the 31 - year - old , a Hindu , told AFP in an interview .
During a six - month undercover mission , Khetan tracked down more than a dozen hardline Hindu activists belonging to various groups allied to Gujarat 's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) administration .
The BJP rules Gujarat , and is India 's main opposition party on the national level .
It has consistently denied any involvement in the massacres five years ago in which at least 2,000 Muslims were killed .
The expose was published by the weekly news magazine Tehelka in October , and made headlines for barely a week .
" Despite the evidence , the political reaction to the expose has been at best tepid and I feel very , very disappointed .
There has been no action , " Khetan said .
The rioting broke out after a Muslim mob was accused of torching a train , burning 59 Hindus alive , on February 27 , 2002 .
An enquiry by the state - run railways later ruled the fire on the train which sparked the riots was an accident .
' Churning with emotion '
The video tapes Khetan filmed showed Hindu zealots apparently boasting of how they took " revenge , " and how they allegedly had the backing of BJP officials and state chief minister Narendra Modi , who is widely expected to be re-elected when Gujarat goes to the polls on December 11 and 16 .
Khetan stumbled onto the story when he heard a chance remark by a university official in Gujarat that he organised attacks against Muslims and supplied weapons during the riots .
" I was churning with emotion - sheer terror of being found out and hope of uncovering the truth , " the reporter said in a telephone interview .
Khetan said he introduced himself to his contacts as a university student researching a paper on Hindu revivalism .
" I said I was a hardcore Hindu who wanted to know what they had done to raise the status and prestige of Hindus , " he added .
" There was this sense of gloating , boasting at their sense of achievement at what they had managed to accomplish . "
More shocking , he said , was the attitude of ordinary Gujaratis .
" There was no remorse , no shame - just the view that the Muslims had it coming .
It shows how much the mind of an average Gujarati has been poisoned , " Khetan said .
He said the sting included moments of heart - stopping fear .
" Once I was travelling with one of the men in his car when he got a phone call .
After finishing the call , he turned to me and said he had been warned about a Delhi journalist doing a sting operation on the riots , " he said .
" I kept a straight face , though I did break into a cold sweat . "

It is n’t surprising , really , that the NRO has decided to annoint Romney as the next Bush ( and what a compliment ! ) .
McCain opposes torture , Giuliani is flopping and scandal - plagued , and Huckabee ’s fate was sealed when those in the know took a look at polls like this .
At any rate , here is an excerpt from the NRO :
Our guiding principle has always been to select the most conservative viable candidate .
In our judgment , that candidate is Mitt Romney , the former governor of Massachusetts .
Unlike some other candidates in the race , Romney is a full - spectrum conservative : a supporter of free - market economics and limited government , moral causes such as the right to life and the preservation of marriage , and a foreign policy based on the national interest .
While he has not talked much about the importance of resisting ethnic balkanization — none of the major candidates has — he supports enforcing the immigration laws and opposes amnesty .
Those are important steps in the right direction .
This is laughable on so many levels that it is difficult to figure out where to begin .
Saying that Romney is the most conservative is akin to putting me in a skirt in the women ’s locker room and claiming I am the most feminine .
It is preposterous .
There were and are actual conservatives in the race - Mike Huckabee is a true - blue social con .
Sam Brownback is a true - blue fiscal and social conservative .
Fred Thompson is startingto sound like a traditional conservative .
And so on .
Mitt Romney , on the other hand , is an unprincipled flip - flopper who will say ANYTHING to become President .
Hell , you do n’t have to rely on me , you can ask Erick at Red State :
Romney is a text book perfect candidate .
He ’s right on the issues .
He ’s right on the looks .
He ’s right on the money .
He ’s right on the executive experience .
He ’s right on the organization .
He ’s right on the family .
He ’s right on the strategy .
He ’s right on the pre-campaign book launch .
He ’s right on who he got to support him in the conservative opinion community .
It ’s like his campaign checked all the boxes before he started and expected things to just work .
The problem of course , is that Romney did the same thing in 1994 and 2002 and on both occasions he checked all the boxes on the other side .
You ’ll have to forgive voters , particularly evangelicals who ’ve seen their hopes go up in flames before , from trusting the guy now .
There is a manufactured , astroturf feel to all of this and it would n’t matter whether he was Methodist or Mormon .
Republicans have a track record of producing poor self funders who check all the boxes expecting campaign flowers to grow .
Just ask Pete Coors .
NRO ’s choice was forced upon them - Giuliani is tanking , Thompson is sleeping , and , most importantly , Huckabee is surging ( and you can expect to see more attacks like this from the establishment ) , and something had to be done , and done quickly , or the corporate establishment might lose all control of the race .
As such , NRO offers a glimmer of honesty :
More than the other primary candidates , Romney has President Bush ’s virtues and avoids his flaws .
His moral positions , and his instincts on taxes and foreign policy , are the same .
But he is less inclined to federal activism , less tolerant of overspending , better able to defend conservative positions in debate , and more likely to demand performance from his subordinates .
A winning combination , by our lights .
Everything but the bolded portion is simple nonsense .
They think Romney can win , and that is all that matters .
Because it sure as hell is n’t Romney ’s record that is convincing them to support him .
At any rate , it should be fun to watch the evangelical base get alienated by the party elites as the establishment candidate is rammed down their collective throats and the go for - the - throat right - wing media do what they can to strangle Huckabee ’s campaign in the crib .
Sit back and enjoy the show .
*** Update ***
And what a show it is going to be :
Republican presidential hopeful Mike Huckabee , an ordained Southern Baptist minister , asks in an upcoming article , ” Do n’t Mormons believe that Jesus and the devil are brothers ? ”
The article , to be published in Sunday ’s New York Times Magazine , says Huckabee asked the question after saying he believes Mormonism is a religion but does n’t know much about it .
His rival Mitt Romney , the former Massachusetts governor , is a member of the Mormon church , which is known officially as the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints .
The authoritative Encyclopedia of Mormonism , published in 1992 , does not refer to Jesus and Satan as brothers .
It speaks of Jesus as the son of God and of Satan as a fallen angel , which is a Biblical account .
A spokeswoman for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints said Huckabee ’s question is usually raised by those who wish to smear the Mormon faith rather than clarify doctrine .
Grab the popcorn and soda , because the GOP is providing the nuts .
Spectator sports have a singular capacity to bring together disparate groups of people towards the common goal of cheering for a favorite team .
However , this noble aim is occasionally forgotten by forty - thousand people collectively thinking , " Hey , I bet I could pick up this stadium chair and throw it at that guy !
That 'll teach him to support my team 's rival . " 
In the spirit of that mindset , here are a few riots you might have missed while watching the Pistons - Pacers Malice at the Palace on YouTube .
1. The Richard Riot
Montreal Candiens Hall of Famer Maurice " The Rocket "  Richard was undoubtedly the top scorer of his era .
As a result of this talent , he was also a target for opposing teams ' abuse .
On March 13 , 1955 , Richard snapped after Boston 's Hal Laycoe high - sticked him in the head during a power play ; Richard retaliated by repeatedly swinging his stick into Laycoe 's face before punching out a linesman who tried to restrain him .
NHL President Clarence Campbell responded by suspending Richard for the rest of the season and the playoffs , which caused outrage in Montreal .
The suspension of Richard may have been justified , but Campbell 's decision to announce that he would attend the next Canadiens home game at the Forum was questionable .
Montreal fans prepared well , and when Campbell arrived with his fiancee , he was greeted by a volley of eggs , vegetables , and anything else Canadiens fans could find to chuck his way .
At some point a tear gas bomb was set off in the arena , but the smoke only angered the fans and forced them outside , where they began looting and vandalizing the area around the Forum in a full - blown riot that lasted most of the night , causing $ 500,000 worth of damage .
The scene was likely described as " violent even by hockey standards . " 
In his public statement , Richard apologized and promised the fans he would return the next year to lead the team to the Stanley Cup .
He made good on his promise ; the Canadiens won the next five Stanley Cups .
2. Nika Riots
Modern racing fans may think their Dale Earnhardt , Jr. gear makes them intimidating , but the aficionados of sixth - century chariot racing at the Hippodrome of Constantinople put them to shame .
Fans of the major Byzantine racing teams , the Blues and the Greens , functioned as something of a pair of politically conscious street gangs .
On January 10 , 532 , several drivers were to be executed for deaths occurring at an earlier race , but a Blue and a Green escaped and hid .
Their respective fans made impassioned pleas for leniency , and responding to public pressure , Emperor Justinian reduced their death sentences to life imprisonment and called for a set of races on January 13th .
The races did n't go so well for Justinian , though ; the racing fans wanted the drivers pardoned entirely .
By the end of the day 's 22nd race , the Blues and the Greens had stopped cheering for their respective factions and started yelling " Nika ! "  ( " conquer "  ) , and in a rioting twist rarely seen since , the two sets of fans joined forces , leading to absolute mayhem .
The unified group launched a siege of the imperial palace and set fire to the city .
Rather than looting , the mob then developed a more political agenda .
Its leaders demanded and received the dismissal of three of Justinian 's ministers and proclaimed Hypatius to be the new emperor .
After five days of violence , Justinian 's generals Belisarius and Mundus brutally suppressed the factions of fans .
Estimates of the casualties reached as high as 30,000 dead , although history fails to record whether conservative sports commentators of the day blamed the incident on the influence of hip - hop on chariot racing culture .
3. A.C. Milan vs. Inter Milan
An April 2005 Champions League quarterfinal between A.C. and Inter Milan seemed like a great place to renew their bitter intercity rivalry " “ or at least wreak some senseless havoc .
Although A.C. won the first of two matches and had gone up 1 - 0 in the second , Inter thought it had scored an equalizer on a header with twenty minutes left .
Much to the displeasure of Inter fans , referee Markus Merk disallowed the goal because an Inter player had fouled A.C. goalkeeper Dida while jockeying for position .
Like any reasonable mob would , Inter fans responded by pelting the field with hails of bottles and that most European of riot weapons : the lit flare .
As Dida cleared away bottles from the pitch to set up a goal kick , he was struck in the shoulder with a flare and received minor burns .
The match was restarted after a thirty - minute delay , but more thrown flares led to its abandonment and A.C. Milan receiving credit for a 3 - 0 victory .
Inter Milan was fined a record 200,000 Euros for the riot , and their fans received the sports version of being sent to their rooms : the club 's first four 2005 - 2006 home matches were played in empty stadiums , effectively making them the soccer equivalent of Atlanta Hawks home games .
Here 's some terrifying amateur video of the events :
4. Red Star Belgrade vs. PAOK Thessaloniki
During a 2006 game for the ULEB Cup ( Europe 's second - tier basketball league ) in Belgrade , a handful of fans of Red Star 's rival Partizan showed up to cheer for the visiting Greek squad .
Red Star fans were understandably a bit perturbed , and a bit of a brawl ensued .
As the hundred or so Partizan fans fought back , things quickly escalated into a heated riot , complete with flare - throwing , an especially questionable tactic in an enclosed arena with a wooden floor and plastic seats .
Hundreds of fans streamed onto the court , and many chucked their stadium seats into the air or at fellow rioters .
Amazingly , only six people were injured in the melee , and after a thirty - minute delay , the game was started .
Partizan fans apparently got what they came for , though , as PAOK won 85 - 81 .
5. New York Yankees vs. Detroit Tigers
No list of violent sports episodes could be complete without an appearance by Ty Cobb .
On June 13 , 1924 , the visiting Yankees were leading the Tigers 10 - 6 in the top of the ninth inning when Cobb , the Tigers ' star and manager , allegedly signaled for Tigers pitcher Bert Cole to plunk the Yankees ' Bob Meusel .
As the story goes , Babe Ruth caught the sign and warned Meusel , who took the pitch on his back and charged the mound .
A brawl erupted between players , including a tense staredown between Cobb and Ruth , and hundreds of fans flooded onto the field to join in on the fracas .
Police eventually subdued the rioters , but Cole and Meusel both took suspensions from the American League .
Ruth and Cole paid fines and the Tigers forfeited the game .
On the bright side , the newly released Mitchell Report does n't connect any of the players on the field that day to performance - enhancing drugs .
6. Andrew Golota vs. Riddick Bowe
Great fighters are often remembered for their signature punch , and Polish heavyweight Andrew Golota could throw a low blow as well as anyone .
In July 1996 , he got his first big - money fight against former champ Riddick Bowe at Madison Square Garden .
Golota dominated the bout despite an absolute unwillingness to stop punching Bowe in the groin .
He was ultimately disqualified for a fourth low blow in the seventh round that left Bowe writhing in pain on the mat .
Naturally , an in - ring scrum broke out in which Golota was repeatedly bashed on the back of the head with a walkie - talkie by a member of Bowe 's entourage .
At this point , a full riot fired up as HBO commentator George Foreman begged for sanity from the crowd .
According to the New York Times ' account of the event , Polish - flag - toting fans tried to storm the ring only to be stopped and fought by other members of the crowd , which had heavily favored Brooklyn 's Bowe .
Mayor Rudy Giuliani , who had been a spectator , spent over an hour hiding out in Golota 's heavily guarded dressing room .
Predictably , Golota and Bowe fought a rematch in Atlantic City .
This time things went marginally better for " The Foul Pole "  ; he made it all the way to the ninth round before being disqualified for three straight shots to Bowe 's groin .
Madison Square Garden has been fairly peaceful since , but Knicks fans are only one more questionable Isiah Thomas trade away from making this donnybrook look like a tea party .
( If you want to jump to the rioting , fast forward to the 2:50 mark . )
7. Sydney Riot of 1879
In 1879 a touring team of English cricketers played a heated series of matches against New South Wales throughout Australia .
After a little more than a day of play in the second match , New South Wales was batting while behind by 90 runs when their star player Billy Murdoch was given out by the English - chosen umpire George Coulthard after a close play .
The Australian crowd was less than pleased to see their hero given out by the English ref , and a surge of 2,000 fans burst onto the pitch to express their displeasure physically .
What followed was an epic throwdown that included English captain Lord Harris being slapped with a stick , English batsman A.N. Hornby being stripped of his shirt , and other Englishmen wielding cricket stumps ( pointy sticks ) as weapons while trying to defend Coulthard .
The crowd was cleared from the pitch twice but kept rushing back onto the field until the day 's play was suspended .
The match eventually resumed the next day , and the English team claimed the victory .
If Ron Artest has a favorite nineteenth - century cricket match ( and he almost certainly does ) , then this one has to be it .

Tomorrow is the release day of Office 2003 SP3 .
Just before another round of service pack installs , we would like to re-introduce our readers to one of the preventive components released by Microsoft called MOICE ( Microsoft Office Isolated Conversion Environment ) .
What 's so great about it ?
MOICE is like an intrusion prevention system for Microsoft Office 2003 .
We all know that the Microsoft 's secure development lifecycle is getting better and better , Office 2007 file parsing code is a lot better than the Office 2003 parsing code .
Based on this fact , MOICE tool converts the Office 2003 ( and below ) document to the new Open XML format and then converts back to the legacy binary format before the document gets actually processed .
While it might sounds like a whole lot more work , these extra steps provide extra validation that would protect the Office instance from many of the file parsing exploit from working .
To provide even more protection , the whole conversion process happens in an isolated desktop environment and is run with a low privilege account to protect the user even if the converter itself become compromised .
If you are running Office 2003 , you might want to seriously consider installing MOICE to protect from future attacks .
For more information on MOICE , refer to the following links

Italian Carabinieri police accompany Michele Catalano ( C ) after his arrest in Palermo November 29 , 2007 .
Italian police burst into the room of the suspected Mafia mobster in Sicily and arrested him as he watched a television show about the arrest of a Mafia boss , investigators said on Friday .
Police said Catalano was watching the concluding chapter late on Thursday of the TV mini-series " The Boss of Bosses " , recounting the arrest in 1993 of the real - life Cosa Nostra leader Salvatore " Toto " Riina , when he was detained .

PALERMO , Italy ( Reuters ) - Italian police burst into the room of a suspected Mafia mobster in Sicily and arrested him as he watched a television show about the arrest of a Mafia boss , investigators said Friday .
Police said Michele Catalano was watching the concluding chapter late Thursday of the TV mini-series “ The Boss of Bosses , ” recounting the arrest in 1993 of real - life Cosa Nostra leader Salvatore “ Toto ” Riina , when he was detained .
They Catalano , 48 , was suspected of being a senior commander serving under the latest “ boss of bosses ” Salvatore Lo Piccolo , who was arrested this month after nearly 25 years on the run .
Catalano faces charges of drug trafficking and extortion .
Lo Piccolo had taken over the reins of the Sicilian crime syndicate from Riina ’s successor Bernardo Provenzano , who was arrested last year after 40 years on the run .
The arrests have seriously weakened the Mafia , police say .
Politicians and cultural figures criticized Channel 5 ’s mini-series for portraying Riina as a hero and lobbied its owner Mediaset , belonging to former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi , to take the final episode off the air .
Mediaset declined .
Nicknamed “ the Beast ” for his brutality , Riina has been convicted on more than 100 counts of murder .
It seems inexplicable that so many of the American people can be so dazed and confused , while moral degenerates ransack our nation , piss and defecate upon the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence , and brazenly loot the public domain , making a mockery of the rule of law and societal norms ; whatever they may be .
Incredible lies are routinely passed as truth and the world as we know it is unraveling , as we prepare to invade and occupy yet another country , perhaps igniting World War Three .
We go on with the insipid routine of our dull lives : we go shopping , and bombard our senses with mind numbing entertainment , telling ourselves that it -- fascism - - ca n't happen here , even as its poisoned blossoms unfold before our astonished eyes and fill our lungs with their noxious fumes .
We refuse to believe what we are seeing and we dismiss it as too preposterous to be real .
We no longer wholly trust our own senses or follow our most innate instincts , failing to recognize that they are all that is true ; all that allow us to survive the wretched madness that pursues us like rabid dogs , and relentlessly nips at our fleeing heels .
Increasing numbers of us move through this world with a sense of impending doom but we do not fully comprehend its origins or the breadth of the disaster it portends .
We sense not only that something is wrong -- something is terribly , irreconcilably , sickeningly , wrong .
We do our utmost to repress those feelings , telling ourselves that our worst fears , our darkest nightmares , are irrational , unfounded phantoms of the imagination ; so many ghosts lurking under our beds .
We have been programmed to believe that we are the greatest nation to ever emerge from the mists of history , that everything about us as a people is exceptional and exemplary .
Despite a history of endless provocation and war and countless other forms of self mutilation , we claim that we are a peace loving people - - god 's own children , animated by divine stirrings .
But perhaps our state of confusion , our disorientation , and our shock at what the government is doing in our name -- all of which seems to be occurring at the blinding speed of light -- and our refusal to believe that which is so blatantly obvious to all but those who wear mental blindfolds , or the criminally insane , is a form of psychological shock and awe that has been deliberately imposed upon us not only by depraved politicians vying for wealth and power , but by our every societal institution .
We have arrived at our place as a result of an educational system that does not teach us how to think , but to follow rules and obey authority ; to bow to self policing peer pressure and group think : a system that prepares us to pass math tests but not those of citizen and neighbor .
We dutifully recite the pledge of allegiance to the flag but we hold no allegiance to the world 's people , or its stunning biological and cultural diversity , or to truth .
We were led to the precipice by religious institutions that operate by the same principles as " for profit " corporations , encouraged by Zionist and Christian fundamentalists with visions of Armageddon dancing in their crazed , bigoted heads .
We are here because we pay attention to a media monoculture that does not inform , but lies and deceives for money .
We are here because we are morally lazy , uninterested , distracted , overworked , over burdened with debt , and apathetic to a fault .
We confused the symbols of democracy with democracy itself ; and we foolishly thought that democracy could somehow magically move of its own accord , without our participation as citizens .
Too many of us believed that all that was required of us was to vote in elections in which the outcomes were preordained by the candidate 's access to wealth .
We told ourselves this is democracy , but we were tragically mistaken .
And now it is too late .
The rush to Armageddon will occur quickly ; it must happen , like the passage of the Patriot Act , before the people have time to digest what is being done to them , before they can concoct an intelligent and rational response to shock and awe ; before the people can organize against the premeditated murder and mayhem that awaits them .
We Americans are the product of free market ideologues , religious zealots , and vulgar experiments in social engineering .
We are being led to slaughter , and to be slaughtered , by dark and foreboding forces bent on the destruction of all that is decent , just , and beautiful .
Yet many will continue to believe that the president and his henchmen are sane and just people .
Some will even ordain them devout Christians and extol their dark virtues as enlightenment and courage .
Others will continue to believe that the sycophants in Congress will awaken at the eleventh hour to save us from our own delusions and excesses , not recognizing that we are alone and have only one another .
It has always been so ; but rather than uniting against our tormentors -- we fight amongst ourselves .
Events may already be in motion that have acquired an unstoppable momentum , like a hulking meteor streaking in deadly silence toward the earth in precise accordance with the laws of motion .
But like all tempests , they too will eventually blow themselves out and , better people than us will someday attempt to rebuild the world anew .
I wish them luck and amazing grace , the kind of grace that is so conspicuously absent in us .
In the words of labor organizer , Joe Hill , murdered by the state before a Utah firing squad : " Good luck to all of you . "
No more can we enjoy the sight of soft summer sunsets in tranquil settings , accompanied by the singing of the wood thrush , and choirs of chanting insects embracing the darkling twilight ; but forever more the rocket 's perpetual red glare and silent , distant death .
We are nearing road 's end .
The time is fast approaching to mount the nearest hillside , to hold our loved ones close ; to sip some vintage wine , and watch the fireworks that are even now hurtling their way toward Armageddon .
The time is nigh to watch the world as we knew it wink out of existence , and to say goodbye .
It 's been good to know you .

Following the popularity of our Top 20 Amazing Optical Illusions list , we are presenting you with another 10 .
10 . Leaning Tower Illusion
The two images above are identical , yet the tower on the right appears to be leaning more steeply .
The reason for this is because the visual system treats the two images as if part of a single scene .
Normally , if two adjacent towers rise at the same angle , their image outlines converge as they recede from view due to perspective , and this is taken into account by the visual system .
9. Color Perception
Believe it or not – the pink spots in the image above are the same – if you do n’t believe me , open the image in photoshop and compare them .
8. Inverse Image
Stare at the center of the image above for about 30 seconds then immediately look at a blank white wall or a piece of white paper .
Stare at the blank paper and an image will emerge .
The more you stare , the clearer the image becomes .
7. Instant Gratification
This one works immediately – stare at the dot in the center of the image and move your head back and forth – the rings will rotate .
6. Straight Lines
The image above is composed entirely of straight lines .
If you do n’t believe , try using a ruler to test it .
5 . Believe it or not
This one is amazing – the blue and green lines in the picture above are the same color .
4. Sacred Heart Illusion
Click the image above to open it as its full size then slowly move your head away from the image .

3. Moving Squares
Move your eyes around the image above and the squares will appear to rotate .
2. The Hollow Face Illusion
This excellent video clip illustrates a brilliant optical illusion known as the Hollow Face Illusion .
1. Monster Magic
In the image above , the two monsters are the same size .
Problem # 1 : Brains of audiences ( and consumers ) want to be deceived
If an audience is to enjoy a movie or performance , they normally must suspend critical judgment to do so .
For example , these folks are watching a movie , which itself is nothing but a series of still images with sound , and these cheap 3 - d glasses do n't help much ; yet , you see emotions .
In addition to a desire to be fooled to be entertained , the brain is also trying very hard to make sense of the world around it .
It 's easier for the brain to interpret what it is seeing as lifelike rather than seeing it for what it is -- a series of projected still frames for film or a scanning beam of electrons lighting up fluorescent dots on the television .
Below is the audience for the Rocky Horror Motion Picture Show .
As you can see , there 's a strong desire to " believe " in the fantasy of the movie .
Suspension of Disbelief :
This is a term used by film critics to describe what film goers must do to stay engaged in the plot of the movie .
Besides ignoring the technology that is making the action on the screen , we also must " suspend our disbelief " and believe in the story and characters .
For example , when watching Pirates of the Caribbean , we must believe Johnny Depp is a pirate .
We also must believe that Davey Jones ( below ) is real , at least real enough to scare us .
Every day we condition ourselves to suspend critical thinking in order to enjoy what we see on television .
For example , we can't watch The Simpsons and be thinking it 's just an electronic signal from a satellite dish .
We also can't think about the artists drawing the characters .
We have to believe that these characters are real to enjoy the story .
When watching music videos , I 'm always disappointed that most singers are allowed to lip sync to the music .
Most viewers , however , accept this as singing .
This lack of critical observation lets imposters get by .
These images are of the group Milli Vanilli , which won a Grammy award but had it revoked when it was discovered that the voices at their concerts and on their records were other singers .
Problem # 2 : Brains are fooled by experience .
Caveman vs. Poker Winner ? :
Who would you think would be more fooled by a card trick , a caveman or yourself , even assuming that you are a seasoned poker player ?
Let 's find out ...
What does the back of the Queen of Clubs look like ?
What does the covered portion of the Queen of Clubs look like ?
What might the back sides of the other cards look like ?
Your familiarity with cards will cause you to be fooled .
Card tricks are often done with altered cards , called gaffed cards .
For example , the back of this Queen of Clubs could be a Jack of Diamonds .
The other side of the right card may be identical to the side you see .
In other words , experience gives you a preconceived idea of what playing cards are suppose to look like and that will cause you to be fooled .
The caveman , therefore , may be able to spot the trick much easier .
The card shark here wants to bet that you can't figure out where the ace is when he turns over the cards .
The game is called the Million Dollar Monte .
Before I ask questions , you should watch this trick done on YouTube at
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBDo3UPpdZs
What are the three cards that you see on the table ?
If you said , 3 of clubs , 2 of clubs , and ace of diamond , then you are using your experience with cards to identify these cards ; however , you would be wrong .
In the next chapter , " Step Behind the Scenes " , I will reveal the secret to this trick .
A rotating mask shows that the brain will force itself to see what it normally sees , which is a face from the outside , not from the back even though we know we are looking at the back side .
Below shows the sequence .
You will notice the right mask feels like it is facing outward despite knowing that it is facing inward .
To see the animated rotation of Einstein 's face visit this Youtube video .
Also notice that when in reverse , it appears to start rotating in the opposite direction . :
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORoTCBrCKIQ.
Chemistry Example :
This looks like the Corvette I had in the 70's ( You can tell I was n't into conservation then ) .
Like all cars at that time , chrome bumpers and chrome trim were made from chrome plated steel .
To polish the chrome I always used a chrome polish , which was a very fine abrasive .
In the 90's I owned an 86 Jaguar ( roll mouse over Corvette to see it ) .
The chrome trim around the windshield on the Jaguar was dull , so I used some chrome polish .
To my dismay , the " chrome " came off with just a few rubs revealing not steel but plastic .
My experience with older cars fooled me into thinking that shiny trim was chrome plated steel , when it was actually just spray painted plastic .
The automobile makers fooled people like me who were accustomed to chrome .
Problem # 3 : Brain is fooled by optical illusions
Optical illusions reveal the flaws in our perceptions .
Sometimes magicians and advertisers take advantage of techniques that fool the mind .
One website has some excellent examples of optical illusions .
The image on the left is from one animation that shows how motion of the blue crosses can cause your mind to become blind to the stationary yellow dots .
Here is the URL : http://www.michaelbach.de/ot/mot_mib/index.html
Here is the URL to the gallery of optical illusions :
http://www.michaelbach.de/ot/index.html
This is an image from Michael Bach 's website .
It shows the after image from our eyes .
The pink dots are disappearing one by one , but if you stare at the cross in the middle , you will think you see a revolving green dot and the pink dots disappear .
In other words , what is there you do n't see , and what is not there you do see !
Our brain works hard to decipher the world around us even when the lighting is not uniform .
For example , we see that the green cylinder is blocking light causing the tiles in the shadow to be darker .
Our brain is not fooled by this , we still think that the tile floor is just made of two colors of tile - an off - white tile and a medium gray tile .
This type of brain power is helpful but can be fooled .
Which of the two tiles are darker , tile " A " or tile " B " ?
Roll mouse over the picture to see A and B only .
That will answer the question .
Because we have two eyes , we are always seeing double , but the brain suppresses one of the images while giving us the illusion of depth .
If you were to hold your two hands in front of you ( like in the picture ) but focus on the computer screen in the background , you will see a floating " sausage " because the brain can't decide which eye 's image to suppress .
Problem # 4 : Out of Sight Out of Mind
To impress your audience , citizen .
or consumer , show them the good but hide the bad .
What is hidden does not get evaluated .
Hide in Clothes :
There 's a reason that magicians wear hats , capes , and long sleeves .
Most of their tricks depend on hiding something from the audience .
For example , their clothes hide the items that disappear or the items that they make appear .
We perceive magic because the secret of the trick is hidden from our view .
Hide in River : Manufacturers are presenting us with all kinds of neat products , but our enthusiasm for a product would be diminished if we knew the maker of that product was polluting our rivers and drinking water .
Rivers are a favorite hiding place for industrial waste because it usually hides it and sends it down river .
EPA ( Environmental Protection Agency ) uses aerial photography to detect pollution because at the ground level it may not be visible .
Unfortunately , many polluters release pollutants at night .
Hide in Ground : Polluters also love to use the ground to hide pollutants .
After it is buried , it is hard for us to see the pollutants leach into the ground and into ground water .
Flush it Down the Drain : Another favorite hiding place for everyone is to flush what we do n't down the drain .
A sewer is better than a river because not only does it flush the waste away from the source , it 's also out of site .
The Guide Corp. , a plant for automotive plating , agreed to a $ 14 million settlement for a toxic substance they poured into the sewer system .
This substance killed the bacteria in the city 's water treatment plant .
" Good " bacteria kills off pathogenic ( disease causing ) bacteria plus good bacteria break down waste .
The treatment plant then releases treated sewage back into the river .
However , the treatment plant ( below ) did n't test the treated sewage and let toxic water flow into the river .
4.6 million fish ( 187 tons ) were killed in the White River that runs through Indiana .
Problem # 5 : The Power of Suggestion & The Placebo Effect
There 's a TV show hosted by magicians Penn & Teller called B.S.
It is an exposé on various subjects .
They talked about the power of suggestion as being a big factor why people can be fooled .
In this episode they had someone dressed up with lab coat and tie and look like a doctor or chemist .
Click the play button to move through the pictures to see how people were fooled by magnets and snails .
By the way , even if the magnets were real , there would be no affect .
The people also talked about how much they would pay for some of these bogus therapies ( around $ 30 ) .
Even though these are examples of individuals , whole groups ( audience ) can also be fooled by the power of suggestion .
The Placebo Effect : Many interesting studies reveal the human 's ability to feel better just because they believe that they should feel better .
A placebo is normally thought of as a " sugar pill " , but placebos can be any kind of treatment that , in itself , has no therapeutic value ; however , if the person or audience believes it should work , many will show improvement .
This relates closely to the power of suggestion that is given when they receive the fake " treatment . "
Problem # 6 : The Bad of Being Good .
Kevin Mitnick is an infamous computer hacker ( served time in prison for computer hacking ) .
You would think his computer skills gives him the most ammunition when breaking into a company 's computer system .
In his book he points out that it is much easier to take advantage of human goodwill .
People want to trust those who appear courteous , helpful , or honest .
People also want to help those in need .
Unfortunately , con artists exploit these good qualities in people .
Can You Help Me? :
For example , here 's a cheerful lad who is burdened with books .
He 's standing at the entrance where people are using their ID badges to open the door .
He asks , " I can't reach my badge right now , could you open the door for me ? "
What would you do ?
Most people will say , " Sure . "
Our natural instinct is to be helpful and trusting and open the door .
We do n't know if this lad is good or bad ; we just want to believe he is good .
Techniques like this one was revealed by the Kevin Mitnick as ways to breach security areas , but it could be used for anything .
Problem # 7 : Audience and Consumers are Too Forgiving of Word Misuse
I grew up in Phoenix , Arizona and understood western lifestyles .
In the 80's I heard a lot about people moving to McCormick Ranch in the town of Scottsdale , just east of Phoenix .
Scottsdale had a cowboy history so I thought it was nice that some people got to live on a ranch .
I envisioned several ranchettes ( small ranches ) that families own .
If you 've ever seen a western movie , you know what a ranch is .
I finally got to visit McCormick Ranch and was quite shocked to what they called ranch living ( roll cursor over image to see what they call a " ranch " ) .
In the valley there are hundreds of housing developments that call themselves ranches .
Sometimes the land where the houses were placed had been a ranch .
For example , McCormick Ranch above had been a real ranch .
However , just because the land had been a ranch does n't mean the place can still be called a ranch .
We also have housing developments named after farms because there once was a farm there .
Both of these add insult to injury because they not only wiped out a ranch or farm , they also stole their name .
It 's like having Disneyland being replaced by a housing development that then calls itself Disneyland Estates .
The problem is that sellers want to romanticize or embellish everything .
They use words , images , and music , but lets focus on the words .
Upon hearing positive words , our brain usually can't help but bring forth some positive responses .
Unfortunately , that can cloud our judgment .
How many things are described as gold that are not gold ?
A lot .
We all like gold , so we accept the use of the word even when it 's a stretch of the meaning .
Euphemisms and doublespeak : Correct words will often communicate too well , so other , more vague words are used to soften the meaning .
Examples are : Neutralize the target ( sounds like giant Alka - Seltzer tablets to me ) , but means kill the enemy .
Collateral damage means destruction and death to innocent bystanders .
Pacification means to kill or disarm insurgents to obtain peace .
Downsizing & rightsizing mean layoffs .
Keeping on the topic of military doublespeak , comedian George Carlin had a famous skit where he talked about how the description of mental problems suffered by returning soldiers has changed .
In World War I , it was called Shell Shock ( you can envision falling shells and the shock of experiencing that ) .
In World War II , it was called battle fatigue ( soldiers were simply tired of doing battle ) .
In the Korean War it was called Operational Exhaustion ( no battle just an operation ) .
In the Vietnam War it was called Post - Traumatic Stress Disorder ( it 's simply stress ) .
Now it 's mostly referred to as PTSD .
The letters hardly convey anything .
Things like this probably inspired others to write a book on doublespeak .

Solution : Time to Grow Up
« Come Fly With Warhawk | Main | Hot Links for the Day »
By Lance Yerelian | October 26 , 2007
Sorry about the long absence but a combination of laziness and the San Diego fires kept me away , but I am back with a preview of one of the Fall ’s most exciting games and possibly the first AAA for the PS3 .
I am sure you are asking yourself how someone you ’ve never heard of , with little writing talent got some hands on time with Sony ’s highly anticipated title .
It is simple , just be lucky and be at Fry ’s while there is a Sony bus there with their tons of games , including Ratchet and Clank , Madden , Lair , and other PS3 games .
When Uncharted was finally free I stepped over to the screen and got my chance to play PS3 ’s AAA fall release .
I expected to play the jungle level which has been seen in so many previews , but surprisingly , I had 3 levels to choose from , the jungle level , a level where you climb into a ruined building , and an action scene in the ruined building .
I skipped the jungle demo because I had read about it enough and selected to play the climbing into the ruined building stage .
If you have played any Prince of Persia or clones ( looking at you Tomb Raider Legends ) you will be able to pick up and play this section with no problem .
Compared to similar games , scaling walls , and jumping felt much faster which added to the excitement .
You are able to grab vines and run alongside the walls to gain speed for long jumps which I found a lot of fun because the animations of the character looked so natural .
Next I played the action scene which included some shooting and a short jumping puzzle .
This next comparison might get the Sony fanboys going crazy , but this game mechanics are very reminiscent of Gears of War .
That ’s right Mr. Average Guy Drake has combat similar to the Cole Train and Marcus Phoenix which is a very good thing in my opinion .
As many of you know Uncharted has a cover system ( which seems to be popping up in most games ) , a 4 weapon select method ( with a grenade selection , 2 main weapons and a pistol ) , and an over the shoulder 3rd person camera .
The guns felt very solid but since it was a quick demo , I never really felt comfortable with all the controls and the over the shoulder camera felt a little too floaty and I never felt like I had exact control when shooting .
The cover system is solid but I was dissapointed at times when I could not use most barriers for cover as some were too short .
Visually the game is fantastic and vibrant giving the feeling of being in a real tropical location due to its color scheme and great lighting .
The animations were varied and natural looking .
My play session ended when a PR person came behind me and was acting all into the game which I found terribly annoying .
When I would die he would give all kinds of encouragement like “ This game is so awesome I know you ca n’t walk away from it ” , and other PR mumbo jumbo .
So that ends my preview of a fantastic game coming exclusively to the PS3 this fall .
It ’s combination of Prince of Persia platforming and Gears of War action truly makes an average Drake feel like Indiana Jones .
PS .
Why do the Sony ’s TVs that are used for all PS3 displays suck balls .

Alone and apparently indifferent to the threat of a sniper 's bullet , Muhammad Rafiq eased up on his stroke rate and tacked over to the shore .
He hauled his craft up the bank to a mosque - the temporary headquarters for his rowing club since US soldiers had commandeered its real boathouse in 2003 .
Inside the courtyard , his forehead beaded with sweat , Muhammad laid a few old blankets over his upturned boat and padlocked the oars to a railing .
" My friends said I was mad when I started rowing , " said the 22 - year - old former science student .
" They said I would be sharing the river with dead bodies and that people would shoot at me .
But it keeps me fit and it keeps me focused for my night work . "
As dusk fell , he checked the contents of his kit bag , slung it over his shoulder and jumped into a waiting taxi .
Fifteen minutes later , he had made it through checkpoints and concrete blast barriers en route to his home in al - Amil district of west Baghdad .
At a makeshift barricade close to the street where he was born he greeted the sentries as friends .
Then he unzipped his kit bag and pulled out a Kalashnikov .
And for the next six uneventful hours he stood guard with his peers behind the straggles of barbed wire .
" I help to keep the peace so that I can row in peace , and that is my passion , " said Muhammad , who asked that neither his real name nor that of his rowing club be used .
" Now when I go out on the river , you can hear the birds and the hum of the generators .
When I began it was only gunfire and bombs . "
Muhammad is one of the thousands of young Baghdadi men to have joined neighbourhood security groups , which have mushroomed over the last year and are a crucial factor in the dramatic decline in civilian deaths .
US soldiers call them " concerned local citizens " ; Iraqis just call them sahwa ( awakening ) after the so - called Anbar awakening in western Iraq , which has seen Sunni tribal sheikhs take on foreign - led Islamists .
There are now an estimated 72,000 members in some 300 groups set up in 12 of Iraq 's 18 provinces , and the numbers are growing .
They are funded , but supposedly not armed , by the US military .
" It is Iraq 's own surge , " said a western diplomat , " and it is certainly making a difference . "
Major General Joseph Fil , the outgoing US commander for Baghdad , said this week that the number of attacks in the capital had fallen almost 80 % since November 2006 , while murders in Baghdad province were down by 90 % over the same time period , and vehicle - borne bombs had declined by 70 % .
The city 's neighbourhood security groups vary greatly in form , content and function .
But they all appear to have sprung from a shared desire to rise above the sectarian tensions tearing apart large areas of their city .
Though life in Baghdad is still far from normal , and the security situation still perilous , the capital 's remarkably resilient population has begun to believe that the momentum for peace may be sustainable if it is left up to ordinary citizens .
" They are filling a void left by Iraq 's feuding and self - serving political elite , most of whom are hunkered down and out of touch in the Green Zone , " said the western diplomat .
Though they are still dominated by Sunnis , the patrols ' make - up increasingly reflects the ethnic and sectarian community they are guarding .
An increasing number of Shia are now joining their ranks , some in a bid to counter the influence of Moqtada al - Sadr 's Mahdi army in their area .
In al - Amil , Muhammad started as a volunteer but now gets about $ 10 a day from the local US ranking officer .
The same goes for his colleagues .
The Americans also gave them combat boots and reflective vests as a kind of uniform .
" We grew tired and angry about the killing , and so decided to act , " said Muhammad .
He said his group , made up of friends and acquaintances mostly in their early 20s , began patrolling the streets of his neighbourhood six months ago .
Sunni militants from a nearby area had driven into his district , which is still home to Shia and Sunni residents , and shot at a popular bakery .
Three people were killed and four wounded as they queued for their morning bread .
" We learned we could not trust anyone who is not from our neighbourhood , " said Muhammad .
" This is our area , but it is for all people equally , no matter how or whether they pray . "
A typical night sees them questioning strangers to the area or stopping cars .
A couple of guards with rifles station themselves on rooftops to provide covering fire if necessary .
They also work closely with the official Iraqi security forces and the US army , passing on , and sometimes acting on , local intelligence about the activities of militants .
Not so long ago Sunni and Shia gunmen were fighting for control of the suburb , near the road to Baghdad 's airport .
As a result , the once religiously mixed housing projects that lie either side of al - Amil 's main street soon separated into Shia or Sunni enclaves .
But Muhammad , a Sunni Arab , and his Shia colleagues in the neighbourhood watch group are determined to reverse the ethnic cleansing .
Last month , the group agreed to protect a Sunni mosque in his street from local Shia militias .
They have also been mediating between the divided communities either side of the highway .
The result was an understanding : Sunni families would return to their former homes in the heavily Shia areas , while Shia families crossed back into the mainly Sunni streets .
The two communities agreed to guarantee the safety of the returnees .
Such was the popular backing for the deal that even the local Mahdi army commander had to acquiesce .
" We 've been neighbours for 25 years and we feel like brothers , " said Muhammad .
" We will help them to guard and respect their mosques , and they wo n't harm me or my family . "
The group has also helped organise local services such as rubbish collection .
Meanwhile , in al - Amil , the improved security has prompted an upturn in the area 's commercial life .
In the still not - quite bustling main food market , Muhammad explained that " five months ago , a word out of place here could have meant a visit from one of the local militia " .
Now the tensions are the subject of humorous exchanges .
" You charged me five dinars more for my vegetables just because I'm a Sunni , " one customer joked with a stallholder .
" This sectarianism is good for your business . "
But as the number and effectiveness of the neighbourhood groups increase , so too do attacks on patrol members .
At the weekend , gunmen and bombers launched three attacks on patrols in Baghdad .
In one incident bombers killed two patrol members and wounded 10 in the Adhamiya area of northern Baghdad , until recently a Sunni Arab militant stronghold .
Gunmen also attacked a patrol in another northern area , killing one patrol member and wounding four .
In the southern Doura neighbourhood , another former Sunni militant stronghold , gunmen wounded three patrol members manning a checkpoint .
There have also been numerous suicide attacks against " awakening " groups in the volatile Diyala province to the north - east .
There are worries too that the neighbourhood groups will , like the police force they are supposed to complement , be prone to infiltration and exploitation by insurgent , militia or criminal gangs .
After all , the security groups are often made up of tribal militias and former insurgent forces that not so long ago fired on US and Iraqi forces .
Now they have turned on al - Qaida in Iraq , the Mahdi army , and other extremist groups .
" It is inevitable that in a force of 70,000 you get a few bad apples , " said General David Petraeus , the senior US commander in Iraq , who has championed the need " to go local " with security .
" But we are taking measures to ensure that they do n't become everyone 's worst nightmare . "
Petraeus said he had persuaded a wary Iraqi government to take responsibility for the funding and future status of the local forces .
About 20 % will be integrated into the security forces while the remaining 80 % will receive some civilian training and involve themselves in public works projects .
A national civil service corps is being considered .
Major General Abdul - Kareem Khalaf of Iraq 's interior ministry said the government recognised the work done by the sahwa groups but said : " It is important that there must never be armed groups outside the framework of the law . "
Back at the barricade , Muhammad said he had no intention of joining the police or army .
" All I want to do is row along the beautiful Tigris and live in peace , " he said .
Albert Ellis
Albert Ellis & Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy ( REBT )
The REBT Network was established in 2006 to promote Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy ( REBT ) and the life & work of its creator , Dr. Albert Ellis , Ph.D. Central to REBT 's teachings is the ancient psychological insight of Epictetus , who said , “ What disturbs men 's minds is not events but their judgments on events . ”
That idea helped REBT become both an effective , evidence - based psychotherapy and a philosophy of living .
The REBT Network is a public service , news organization designed to provide self - help information , news updates , historical background and educational essays about REBT and the contributions of Dr. Albert Ellis to the field of psychology and philosophy .
We sell no products or services .
Dr. Ellis founded an educational and therapy institute in 1959 , which is now known as the Albert Ellis Institute .
From 2005 , up until the time of his death , Dr. Ellis was involved in a legal dispute with the Albert Ellis Institute , which he said was following an agenda that is in many ways inconsistent with Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy .
The REBT Network is in no way affiliated with the Albert Ellis Institute .
Albert Ellis Ph.D. was a clinical psychologist who trained as a psychoanalyst .
Early in his career , he became disillusioned with the slow progress of his clients .
He noticed that they got better much quicker once they changed their ways of thinking about themselves and their problems .
In 1955 he developed Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy ( REBT ) .
Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy ( REBT ) is now a widely - practiced , comprehensive , and highly effective form of psychotherapy .
In addition to being a proven therapy , REBT offers an approach to life that leads to greater fulfillment and happiness .
At the heart of REBT are the concepts of unconditional self - acceptance , unconditional other - acceptance , and unconditional life - acceptance .

Tough job market for GOP : Congressional staffer bolts to become hotel manager Nick Juliano
Published : Monday December 3 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This Job paths in politics tend to follow a fairly similar pattern .
Young motivated men and women typically start with low - paying gigs working for members of Congress , and as they move up the food - chain more lucrative opportunities with outside consulting or lobbying firms often present themselves .
The career path of one Republican congressional staffer may show a tough job market for the GOP , as Roll Call reports Monday .
The communications director for Rep. Todd Tiahrt ( R - KS ) told colleagues he is leaving the Hill -- and politics altogether -- to manage a Holliday Inn Express in Kansas .
 I knew times were tough for Republicans on the Hill but looks like things might be sinking to a whole new level if these are the only options we have left , , " one GOP staffer told the newspaper 's gossip column .
Chuck Knapp , the departing staffer , tells " Heard on the Hill " that his departure from Tiahrt 's office after seven years was motivated by the prospect of regular hours and the opportunity to spend more time with his family .
Currently based in Tiahrt 's Wichita district office , Knapp said he 's ready to abandon the monthly trips to Washington his job required .
After 17 years in politics , Knapp said he knows that the " spending more time with my family " line is sure to raise skepticism in explaining his unorthodox move , but he wo n't be losing any sleep worrying about doubters .
 People can spend all the time second - guessing or speculating , but I know that I m doing the right thing for me and my family ,  he told the paper .
 My wife tells me she has already noticed the difference . 
Japanese researchers have developed a leg - wheel hybrid robot that ’s capable of both walking and skating , using “ a special foot mechanism which changes between feet soles for the walking mode and passive wheels for the wheel . ”

KANDAHAR , Afghanistan ( CNN ) -- NATO is acknowledging YouTube as its new battleground in the six - year war on Taliban fighters in Afghanistan , as the military alliance posts formerly secret surveillance and attack video .
The strategy aims to counter years of propaganda video posted on the Internet showing Taliban attacks on NATO forces which fighters use to claim that NATO 's position in the Afghan war is deteriorating .
" The Taliban , who are literally cave - dwellers , are doing better than we are on a key battleground -- and that 's video , " said NATO spokesman James Appathurai .
" They deploy with videographers .
We do n't .
They have DVDs out in an hour , we do n't . "
Wielding video cameras like weapons , fighters quickly upload images of their attacks and create a valuable morale booster for their supporters .
Now , after much internal debate , NATO has begun declassifying and posting top secret combat video on YouTube and other Web platforms to try and beat the Taliban at its own game .
" We 're , in a sense , winning the tactical battles , but we 're not focusing enough on the strategic battle , which is public opinion , " said Appathurai .
Watch dramatic declassified NATO attack video »
NATO made several video excerpts available to CNN .
One excerpt shows an armed Taliban fighter disguised as a woman in a full burqa , taking refuge with women and children to avoid being targeted by NATO .
One disturbing NATO video begins with a birds - eye view of a home in southern Afghanistan where NATO said a high - level Taliban meeting was taking place .
Before NATO helicopters took aim at the house , a small boy is posted at the door as a human shield , forcing the NATO chopper pilot to hold fire .
Information is a crucial tool in any war , but is especially important in Afghanistan where the Taliban 's deeds , words and images have portrayed a deteriorating security landscape , with NATO soldiers on the run .
NATO officials argue that this is far from the truth and the country has experienced significant development and growth with constant attention being paid to security problems .
Appathurai said there are hundreds of military combat videos that show the true extent of Taliban engagement and the brutality of their tactics .
He admitted that in the past he had a hard time convincing NATO allies to declassify this sensitive , secret video for wide release .
He said on occasion , that will now change .
NATO said the Taliban videos slowly erode the world 's perception of how the Afghanistan mission is progressing .
But the Taliban 's media savvy means much more , said one expert .
Videos such as those produced by the Taliban are the lifeblood of terrorist recruiting campaigns , said Glen Jenvey , a UK - based Internet specialist who tracks trends in extremist and jihad content on the Web .
" At one point somebody has actually brainwashed these people to become terrorists , and this is where the recruiting sergeants actually take hold and the online part is an important part of it , " Jenvey said .
NATO forces in Afghanistan boast a contingent of about 41,000 soldiers from 38 nations , including 19,000 U.S. troops , according to the Pentagon .
The mission is the largest ground operation in the military alliance 's history .
In October 2001 , a U.S. - led coalition invaded Afghanistan and toppled the Taliban - led government which harbored al Qaeda terrorists responsible for the September 11 attacks .
In addition to Taliban fighters , NATO troops also hunt for al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden , who is thought to be hiding along the rugged Afghan - Pakistan border .

Young chimpanzee can recall number placement better than people can .
Remember this : even if the numbers flash up for only an instant , this chimp can remember where they were .
Courtesy of the researchers
A particularly cunning seven - year - old chimp named Ayumu has bested university students at a game of memory .
He and two other young chimps recalled the placement of numbers flashed onto a computer screen faster and more accurately than humans .
“ It ’s a very simple fact : chimpanzees are better than us — at this task , ” says Tetsuro Matsuzawa , a primatologist at Kyoto University in Japan who led the study .
The work does n't mean that chimps are ' smarter ' than humans , but rather they seem to be better at memorizing a snapshot view of their surroundings — whether that be numbers on a screen or ripe figs dangling from a tree .
Humans may have lost this capacity in exchange for gaining the brainpower to understand language and complex symbols , says Matsuzawa .
“ I work with some pretty smart chimps , but they 're not going to do your calculus homework ” Michael Beran
Quick as a flash
Two decades have passed since Matsuzawa ’s team first taught a female chimp , Ai , to recognize and order Arabic numerals1 .
Later , he and Nobuyuki Kawai trained her to memorize the location of numbers as they flashed onto a computer screen .
The numbers would be quickly covered with white squares , and Ai could then touch those squares in order of the numbers concealed beneath them2 .
After much training , chimps can be remarkably good at this task ( see video , in real time ) .
Matsuzawa and Sana Inoue went on to train three pairs of mother chimps and their infants to recognize and remember numerals , as Ai had done .
The kids outmatched their mothers most of the time , and Ai's son Ayumu was head of the class , they report today in Current Biology .
3
When Ayumu went head - to - head against university students in the game , he made them look like dunces .
This was most noticeable when the numbers appeared on the screen for just two tenths of a second - too brief for humans to get a good grip on them .
Here , Ayumu correctly ordered the numbers in 80 % of trials , while the students scored an average of just 40 % ( see video ) .
It 's unclear how long Ayumu ’s memory of the number placement lasts after seeing them flash on the screen .
When a sound across the room caught his attention , he paused in the middle of a game for ten seconds before finishing the puzzle ( see video ) .
Matsuzawa plans to test how much longer chimps can remember the numbers .
Mental trade - off
Could the chimps ' superiority come from simply having had more practice ?
Ayumu had been playing the game throughout his seven years of life , and got a treat after each run .
But the researchers think this practice was n't Ayumu 's only advantage .
“ We trained university students for six months and their accuracy did not reach this level , ” says Matsuzawa .
He suggests that humans made a mental trade - off as they diverged from their common ancestor with chimps some 5 to 6 million years ago .
In gaining brawnier brains that can process language and other complex symbols , we may have dulled our ability to take quick mental snapshots .
ADVERTISEMENT
To find that chimps are better than humans at some specific tasks is not surprising , says Michael Beran , a psychologist at Georgia State University in Atlanta .
Chimps and humans are in some ways very similar , he points out .
The key to uncovering a chimpanzee 's inner Einstein is to put them to the right kind of test , he says .
There are limits , however .
“ I work with some pretty smart chimps , but they 're not going to do your calculus homework , ” says Beran .
Gold Tumbiles as Credit Crunch Hits E-trade
Gold
Gold was down $ 26.20 to $ 805.90 per ounce in New York on Monday and silver was down 75 cents to $ 14.73 per ounce .
A sharp correction was expected after gold 's surge in the last two months .
Last week alone gold was up some 3 % and silver surged by over 6 % and profit taking and a correction was inevitable .
Gold also fell in GBP and EUR .
It is trading at £ 388 GBP ( down from £ 393 ) and € 549 EUR ( down from € 560 ) .
In Asian and European trading gold is down to $ 803.50 per ounce at 1100 GMT .
Profit taking , a fall in oil prices and tentative dollar strength are likely the primary reasons behind this much anticipated correction .
Support is near yesterday 's low at $ 790 per ounce and below that at the 50 day moving average at $ 765 .
The sell off is likely to be sharp but shallow .
Fears that we may experience something akin to the sell off in May 2006 which saw gold fall from $ 730 to $ 560 are likely to be unfounded .
In May 2006 , oil was not over $ 90 per barrel , there was no property and credit crisis and little or no obvious systemic risk .
Those who short the market to the tune of billions are likely to be be eager to at least close some of their positions which will be supportive of gold .
Many investors actually missed this move up by trying to time the market and they are waiting to buy on the dips as are other bargain hunters .
In addition , none of the fundamental reasons that gold has risen in price in recent years and surged in the last few months have gone away and indeed some have intensified .
The credit crisis is widening and deepening and may soon become a solvency and bankruptcy crisis .
Shares in E - Trade , the online broker that has seen its expansion into the mortgage market backfire , plunged nearly 59 per cent on Monday amid fears that its dependence on uninsured deposits could force it to sell assets at fire sale prices .
" Bankruptcy risk cannot be ruled out , " Citigroup analysts said in a research note Sunday .
Bankruptcy was mentioned as a possibility for Countrywide Financial , the largest U.S. mortgage lender , as well .
In a quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission late Friday , Countrywide ( CFC ) warned that additional cuts in its credit ratings to junk - bond levels could " severely " limit its ability to raise money in public debt markets and cause it to lose bank deposits , the Wall Street Journal reported .
The worsening credit crisis will almost certainly lead to a serious recession and lead to safe haven demand for gold which is the only asset class that is not a third party 's liability .
While gold might be correlated with equities in the very short term ( minutes and hours ) it should be clear that gold is not correlated with other asset classes over the medium and long term .
The S&P 500 is down by 7.85 % in the last 30 days while gold is up 7.15 % .
Year to date the S&P 500 is up 1.47 % but gold is up by more than 26 % .
Not to mention the more obvious example of a multi year bull market in gold such as the 1970s when gold surged in price for 9 years while stock markets were down significantly adjusted for the significant inflation of the period .
Some gold analysts of the more bearish persuasion do n't allow facts to get in the way of a pet theory .
Forex and Gold
The dollar has shown tentative signs of recovery but is largely flat against the EUR at 1.4588 ( from 1.455 ) and GBP at 2.068 ( from 2.069 ) .
The notion that the dollar rallied on " safe haven buying " is highly erroneous .
This is yet another dead cat bounce for the dollar and purely a function of profit taking and an inevitable countertrend rally .
When there are headlines that supermodels are bearish on the dollar , speculators rightly take profits .
However , the fundamentals of the dollar remain extremely weak and it will soon resume its bear market .
Yesterday we warned of the massive risk of a huge unravelling of the Japanese yen , and to a lesser extent Swiss franc , carry trade .
The yen is appreciating " too fast " and speculators need to " be careful , " Yasuo Fukuda , Japan 's prime minister , warned in an interview with the Financial Times on Monday .
As the yen moved to an 18 - month high of Y109.13 to the U.S. dollar on Monday night , Mr Fukuda said : " In the short term , yen appreciation would certainly be a problem .
Any kind of sudden change in exchange rates would not be desirable . "
While he stopped short of threatening Japanese intervention in the currency markets , Mr Fukuda said : " Speculative movements need to be kept in check .
What I am saying is : ' Be careful , so that it [ intervention ] will not happen . ' "
Currency intervention as with most government interventions in the market will prove futile in the long term and an unwinding of the yen carry trade looks inevitable in the coming months .
As it does with the gold carry trade ( where groups have been able to borrow gold very cheaply from central banks , sell it into the market supressing the gold price , and then reinvest the proceeds into a higher yielding investment ) as outlined in this article in Money Week - http://www.moneyweek.com/file /32734 / the - gold - carry - trade .html .
Silver
Silver sold off sharply yesterday and gave up much of the gains of last week .
Silver is trading at $ 14.65 at 1100 GMT .
PGMs
Platinum was trading at $ 1401/1404 ( 1100 GMT ) .
Spot palladium was trading at $ 364/369 an ounce ( 1100 GMT ) .
Oil
Oil prices remain near record highs with light sweet crude at just below $ 95 per barrel .

While it may not seem like Batter Blaster has any gadget appeal , I still feel it ’s one of the more important innovations of the 21st century so far .
It ’s basically a pre-mixed , 100 % organic pancake batter that ’s been packaged into an aerosol can .
So not only can you skip the usual ingredients list , you do n’t even need to mess a bowl or spoon .
You just shake the can and then ‘ blast ’ the contents directly onto your hot skillet or waffle iron .
Based on a handful of online reviews I ’ve read , the pancakes produced by the Batter Blaster are actually quite good .
Of course anyone who ’s ever tried cheese - in - a - can will be a bit skeptical , and personally I do n’t think I ’d be able to enjoy pancakes - in - a - can without a side of bacon - in - a - can as well .
At the moment it looks like Batter Blaster is slowly being rolled across the west coast , and while I could n’t find any online stores selling it , I ’d love to know if any of our readers have tried it out .

( CNN ) --
Like a first love or a first car , a first computer can hold a special place in people 's hearts .
For millions of kids who grew up in the 1980s , that first computer was the Commodore 64 .
Twenty - five years later , that first brush with computer addiction is as strong as ever .
Millions of Commodore 64s were sold in the 1980s .

" There was something magical about the C64 , " says Andreas Wallstrom of Stockholm , Sweden .
He remembers the day he first laid eyes on his machine back in 1984 .
" My father brought it home together with a tape deck , a disk drive , a printer , and a couple of games ... I used to sneak home during lunch to play [ on it ] with my friends . "
Learn about the components of the C64 system »
Wallstrom is the webmaster and designer for C64.com , a Web site dedicated to preserving the games , demos , pictures , magazines and memories of the Commodore 64 .
C64.com visitors are mostly nostalgia seekers -- men in their 30s looking to download their favorite childhood games .
Emulators let them play the games without having a machine .
Popular downloads include " Boulder Dash , " " Ghostbusters , " and " The Great Giana Sisters . "
" It may have not been the most sophisticated computer , but it did have a lot of personality and it was lovable and remains loveable , " said Harry McCracken , vice president and editor in chief of PC World .
Often overshadowed by the Apple II and Atari 800 , the Commodore 64 rose to great heights in the 1980s .
From 1982 - 1993 , 17 million C64s were sold .
The Guinness Book of World Records lists the Commodore 64 as the best - selling single computer model .
The computer featured 64 kilobytes of memory ( a lot for 1982 ) , a huge index of games , a sophisticated sound chip , and a relatively parent - friendly price -- $ 595 .
On Monday , the Computer History Museum in Mountain View , California , will celebrate the C64's 25th anniversary .
Computer pioneers will reflect on the C64's achievements and contribution to the industry .
Jack Tramiel , the founder and CEO of Commodore , will attend , along with Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak and William C. Lowe , father of the IBM PC .
" It was the right machine for the time , " said McCracken .
" The Commodore 64 did a lot to popularize computers . "
Sold in shopping malls and discount stores and not just small computer stores -- the norm for the time -- the C64 became many people 's gateway into the world of computers , said Brian Bagnall , author of " On the edge : The spectacular rise and fall of Commodore . "
" It was so new , " Bagnall said .
Users could play many games and also learn the programming language of computers -- BASIC .
Jim Park , 39 , a software developer in Minneapolis , Minnesota , got his start on a C64 in 1984 when he was 16 .
Park learned to program motion - graphics synchronized to dance music and ran a BBS , an electronic bulletin board system , the precursor to the Internet .
" I really lucked out that something so obscure and nerdy has turned into the modern business and pop-culture phenomenon that it has , " he said .
Wallstrom said it was the simplicity of the C64 that made it so great .
" You switched it on and it was there , ready for input in a second .
Programming on the C64 was straightforward because you got to command the processor directly .
You had full control of the whole computer ... that is something you do n't have with any modern PC . "
Still , the C64 had an uneven reputation .
It was widely considered clunky , its BASIC outdated and graphics weak in comparison to the Apple II and Atari 800 , according to McCracken .
And then there was the quirky floppy drive .
" It was pitifully slow , " Bagnall said .
" It was big and noisy .
It sounded like a Gatling gun when it was trying to load stuff . "
The floppy drive took so long to load , the music would play before the game did , recalls Rob Kramer , artistic & business director of Productiehuis ON , a production company based in the Netherlands .
" These tunes would get stuck in your head , " he said .
In 2006 Kramer came up with the idea of having an orchestra play the music from the games .
" We found this crazy orchestra that plays on the street .
It 's full of young people in music school .
They are in their 20s and they 'd never played a Commodore 64 .
For them it was like ' Wow , this is great stuff . ' "
The 12 - piece C64 Orchestra has played at churches , musical venues and festivals .
The compositions run 4 - 6 minutes .
The crowds are mostly fans of the C64 .
" They really dig it , " Kramer said .
Watch how I - Reporters are using the C64 today »
Kramer described the music as haunted .
" There 's a lot of tension , and it repeats itself .
It takes you places where normal classical music does n't . "
Watch as the orchestra plays »
The classical ensemble released a CD in Europe featuring the original computer and orchestral versions of " Delta , " " Commando , " Monty on the Run , " " International Karate " and more .
The CD will be available in the United States on January 15 .
By 2007 computing standards , the Commodore 64 is a dinosaur .
A relic of the past , long made obsolete by the march of time .
But the C64 is n't dead .

CARACAS ( Reuters ) - Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez demanded on Tuesday Spain ’s king apologize for telling him to shut up , warning that Spanish investments could suffer in its former colony because of the spat .
Chavez , who railed against imperialism and capitalism , named banks Santander and BBVA as possible targets , saying the OPEC nation did not need Spanish business .
“ The king lost it , ” Chavez said at a late - night political rally .
“ He should say , ‘... I , the king , confess , I was beside myself , I made a mistake . ’ ”
At the weekend , King Juan Carlos told Chavez to shut up at a summit of leaders from Latin America and Iberia when the Venezuelan leftist interrupted a speech by Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero .
The controversy has tested relations with Spain , sparked headlines around the world and eclipsed debate in Venezuela over Chavez ’s effort to win approval in a December 2 referendum to expand his powers , including scrapping term limits .
“ Whatever has been privatized can be taken back , we can take it back , ” Chavez said earlier at a news conference .
“ If the government of Spain or the state of Spain ... start to generate a conflict , things are not going to go well . ”
Spain , a top investor in Venezuela and the rest of Latin America , sought to ease tensions through diplomatic channels .
“ We are fully convinced that due to action being taken on all sides it will be possible in a relatively ... short time , to return ties to normal , ” Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos said .
Spanish telecommunications giant Telefonica is also a major mobile phone operator in the South American country .
Chavez , who has been nationalizing swaths of the economy , took over the biggest phone company in Venezuela and also threatened to seize the whole banking sector this year as he tries to create a socialist state .
Spanish businesses have invested $ 2.4 billion in Venezuela since Chavez took office in 1999 , according to Spain ’s Business and Commerce Council .
Grupo Santander has some $ 700 million in investment in Venezuela , while Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA has $ 670 million invested , according to figures provided by the companies .

CONTROVERSIAL COMIC
Chavez , who called former conservative Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar a fascist at the weekend meeting , has courted controversy at summits before , most notably last year by calling U.S. President George W. Bush the devil at the United Nations .
Political analysts say Chavez relishes such fights because he uses them to fire up his support base among the majority poor at home with blunt rhetoric that plays on their misgivings of rich countries ’ investments in Latin America .
On Tuesday , he said the king ’s “ arrogance ” exposed that colonial attitudes toward South America have not died out .
But the folksy president also showed he had a sense of humor over the flap .
When a reporter asked him a series of questions about the raft of constitutional changes expected to be passed in next month ’s plebiscite , he joked : “ Why do n’t you shut up ? ”

You can't go far wrong in a truck equipped with an Astrata box .
The device , half the size of a cigarette pack , can be wired into anything that moves - truck , car , shipping container - to head off nearly every conceivable type of disaster .
It can be programmed to stop a drunk or unauthorized driver from starting a vehicle , for example , or detect and shut down a truck that has been hijacked , locking the thief inside and alerting its owners .
The Astrata - GLP ( global location platform ) is part Big Brother , part James Bond - except that it already exists , and corporations and governments are paying close attention .
Powered by GPS tracking , wireless communication , and a Linux - based operating system , Astrata is the brainchild of Martin Euler and Tony Harrison , a British accountant and an Irish technology executive , respectively , who bet that the need for tracking and security devices would grow exponentially after 9/11 .
Their client list now includes Shell Oil ( Charts ) , Nestl� , and the government of Singapore .
Course correction
Astrata can detect a gasoline tanker that veers one block off its route , thwarting attempts to use it as a bomb .
Security giant Group 4 Securicor puts it in armored cars in Indonesia .
Driver ID system
Astrata can be programmed to start only after the driver passes a breathalyzer test and presses a thumb for identification .
A video camera can record the driver 's activities .
Singapore 's Civil Defense Force is using the camera and thumb ID system in its hazmat trucks .
Speed tracker
Once Astrata detects a stolen ( or speeding ) vehicle , it can slow it to 5 mph or stop it completely .
One commercial client uses the device to monitor how fast its truck drivers are going and how aggressively they drive .
The box also tracks when the trucks are moving , so drivers can't pad overtime claims or moonlight with company property .
Instant holding cell
Doors and windows can be locked remotely , trapping would - be terrorists , thieves , or reckless drivers inside .
The device can also be programmed to flash hazard lights , blare the horn , notify headquarters , and summon police .

Most Venomous Snakes - Meet the Inland Taipan
© 2019 , Brandon Cornett |
All rights reserved
People have been arguing over the most venomous snakes for as long as I can remember ( and I 've been keeping and researching snakes for more than 20 years ) .
The reason there is so much dispute over the most venomous snakes in the world is because people judge them by different criteria , and this inevitably leads to arguments .
For example , some people build their lists of the most venomous snakes by using the LD50 test .
LD50 stands for lethal dose 50 percent .
In the case of snake venom LD50 is a scale used to measure the potency of a snake 's venom .
It refers to the amount of venom that , when given all at once , kills 50 percent of the animals tested ( mice , in this case ) .
Other people create lists of the most venomous snakes in the world by considering the venom yield , meaning the amount of venom the snake can produce with a given bite .
Thus , you can probably find dozens of lists that claim to contain the " Top 10 Most Venomous Snakes " in the world , and many of these lists will conflict with each other .
Most Venomous Does Not Mean Most Dangerous
While I 'm at it , I 'd like to clear up another important point regarding venomous snakes .
Many people create lists of what they claim are the " most dangerous " snakes in the world , and they will simply list ten of the most venomous snake as ranked by the LD50 tests mentioned above .
But there is a big difference between a highly venomous snake and a highly dangerous snake .
Many snakes that are high on the venom charts are shy and reclusive , and therefore account for very few human fatalities .
How could you put such snakes on a list of the world 's most dangerous snakes ?
On the flip side of that coin , there are certain venomous snakes that , while they do not rank in the top - ten most venomous , still account for a large number of human fatalities each year .
This might be because that particular snake is found in highly populated areas far from medical care , that the snake is comparatively more aggressive toward humans , or a combination of these factors .
A good example of this would be the saw - scaled viper ( Echis carinatus ) , which accounts for a relatively high number of deaths in Sri Lanka .
While it is certainly highly venomous , the saw - scaled viper does not appear on any top - ten lists of " most venomous snakes . "
However , it accounts for more deaths than any other snake within its range , largely because of its habit of hiding itself in areas trafficked by humans .
My point is , you cannot make a list of the most venomous snakes in the world and refer to them as the " most dangerous " snakes ... nor the opposite .
They are two separate things , and they need to be treated as such .
To echo that sentiment , here 's an excerpt from a Princeton University Press interview with Mark O'Shea , snake expert , TV personality and author of the book Venomous Snakes of the World :
" The most dangerous snake is not the most venomous .
The most venomous snakes are taipans , Australian brown snakes and sea snakes but they have small venom yields and few snakebites to humans and few human fatalities in the scheme of things ... with that in mind I have encountered many dangerous snakes from rattlers to cobras , sea snakes to desert vipers but I regard the most dangerous snake I have encountered to be the Sri Lankan Russell 's viper ... "

Most Venomous Snake - Meet the Inland Taipan
Despite all of the semantic arguments and scientific disputes , there is one fact that most people seem to agree on .
The most venomous snake , measured by the LD50 test or any type of criteria , is the inland taipan snake of Australia .
Image : Inland taipan snake by Wikipedia contributor
The inland taipan ( Oxyuranus microlepidotus ) possesses the most toxic venom of any snake in the world .
But here again , that does not necessarily mean that the inland taipan -- also known as the fiece snake -- is the " most dangerous " or deadliest snake in the world .
As we discussed , most venomous does not always translate to most dangerous .
In fact , the inland taipan proves this point for me .
Worldwide , more than 40,000 people die each year from venomous snakebite .
But Australia only has 2 - 3 snakebite deaths each year .
So how can a continent with the world 's most venomous snake , the inland taipan , have such a relatively low number of snakebite deaths each year ?
The answer , of course , is that the inland taipan , while highly venomous , is not one of the deadliest snakes in the world .
Sure , it has lethal venom with the potential to kill humans , but there is a world of difference between potentiality and reality .
The inland taipan is the world 's most venomous snake by most standards , but is by far NOT the world 's deadliest snake .

THE UNION OF THE STATE
is the oral history of the troupe ’s creation , dissolution , reinvention and reunion over the last three decades , told by the members of the group and their collaborators .
Years in the making , this is the whole story !
Order now !
Here 's a review !
IT HAS always been a question of how , not if , Vladimir Putin would retain power in Russia when his second , and ( according to the constitution ) final presidential term runs out in March 2008 .
This week Mr Putin lifted the veil .
At a congress of the pro-Kremlin United Russia party , he graciously agreed to head its party list at the general election in December .
He added that he may become prime minister if the party wins the election and the president is a man he can work with .
United Russia is sure to win and , since Mr Putin will hand - pick the president , he will presumably get along with him .
So this charade has only one meaning : Mr Putin is staying on , probably for a very long time .
This is part two of Mr Putin 's game plan .
Part one came three weeks ago when he appointed an unknown technocrat , Viktor Zubkov , as prime minister and hinted that he might become president .
Mr Zubkov has three main qualifications : he has no visible political ambitions , is quite old ( 66 , to Mr Putin 's 54 ) and is personally loyal ( he was Mr Putin 's deputy in St Petersburg 's mayoral office . )
Now Mr Putin has a couple of options .
He could take a short break from the Kremlin and move into the prime minister 's chair , leaving Mr Zubkov ( or another pliant candidate ) to look after the Kremlin for a while .
Mr Zubkov would then step down , perhaps for health reasons , and Mr Putin would automatically return as president without breaking the letter of the constitution .
His other , more complicated option , is to use United Russia 's dominance of the Duma , the lower house of parliament , to change the constitution and devolve real power to the prime minister , turning the presidency into more of a ceremonial job .
This would also allow him to stay in power without the appearance of breaking the constitution .
Either plan has risks .
His popularity may not transfer easily to somebody like Mr Zubkov , who uncannily resembles the Soviet - era collective - farm director that he once was .
Any more colourful candidate could renege on a deal .
The idea of two power - centres in Russia , even for a short time , poses problems , particularly when rivalry between factions in the Kremlin is intensifying .
In the short term foreign investors are taking comfort from Mr Putin 's move .
Western leaders may hold their noses , but they will continue to deal with Mr Putin much as they do now .
In the longer term , Mr Putin 's plan does not bode well for the economy or for political stability .
More important , it will do nothing to make it easier to solve any of the country 's huge problems , such as the state of the army , rampant corruption , a health - care crisis or a looming demographic crunch .
In the words of Lilia Shevtsova , a political analyst at the Carnegie Moscow Centre , the plan “ eliminates politics ” and closes down the channels of social mobility for many aspiring Russians .
By staying in power after 2008 , Mr Putin may have made himself , in effect , a Kremlin hostage ; he has also overridden one of the big achievements of the Yeltsin era : a voluntary transfer of power from one political leader to another .
Kremlin ideologues like to describe Russia as a “ sovereign democracy ” , whatever that means .
Elsewhere it would be called an autocracy .
It has nothing in common with a real democracy , which implies competition for power .
Mr Putin likes to talk about his country 's revival and greatness .
Yet , for all his talk , he treats his people with contempt , reducing the political process to a Byzantine and meaningless guessing - game .
“ Is n't it fun ?
The president appears in public , stretches out two closed hands and asks cunningly : where is the sweet ?
That is the only question deemed suitable for the population , ” Lev Rubinshtein , a Russian essayist , wrote this week .
Disconcertingly for critics , the vast majority of the Russian population seems to like the game and to support Mr Putin , whose popularity rating is consistently above 70 % .
The lack of independent television is only one reason for this .
The bigger point is that Mr Putin 's rule has coincided with a spectacular rise in oil prices , leading to improved living standards for millions of Russians .
As one United Russia delegate who pleaded with Mr Putin to stay in power put it this week : “ Vladimir Vladimirovich , you are lucky !
And while you are the president , luck follows Russia .
For tens of millions of people you are a token , a symbol of Russia 's successful development . ”
Yet luck , like oil money , tends to run out sooner or later .
Everyone has a reading lane .
Whether it ’s romance novels or timey - wimey sci- fi books about people becoming their own grandparents , readers often have a channel they return to over and over again .
Of course , every now and then we all have an " Eat Your Vegetables " moment when we think that maybe we ought to read a classic — one of those novels we skimmed unenthusiastically in school , gleaning just enough information from the back cover and online sources to write a book report on a text we ’ve been hearing is absolutely genius for our entire lives .
There are a lot of classic novels out there , so it 's OK if you do n't know where to start .
These five classics are not only great books , but they also laid the groundwork for current bestsellers and remain some of the most celebrated works of literature ever produced .
01 of 05 ' Moby - Dick ' Macmillan Collector 's Library " Moby - Dick " has an unearned reputation for being , well , dull .
Melville ’s novel was n’t received well upon publication ( it took decades before people really started to " get " how great it is ) , and the negative sentiment is echoed every year when groaning students are forced to read it .
And , yes , there is a lot of talk about 19th - century whaling that leaves even the most thoughtful reader sometimes wondering when , exactly , Melville plans to get to the fireworks and make something happen .
Add to this the immense vocabulary that Melville utilizes — over 17,000 unique words in the book , some of which are specialized whaling lingo — and " Moby - Dick " is one of the densest novels ever written .
Why You Must Read It : Despite these surface difficulties , you should make " Moby - Dick " one of the classics you read for several reasons : Pop culture status .
There ’s a reason the term “ white whale ” has become shorthand for a foolhardy and dangerous obsession .
The name " Captain Ahab " is also used as cultural shorthand for an obsession - crazed authority figure .
In other words , our daily conversation often references the novel whether we realize it or not , and that tells you something about just how powerful the book and its characters really are .

The deep themes .
This is n’t just a long book about a guy hunting a whale .
It explores complex and elusive themes about existence , morality , and the nature of reality .
From the famous opening line of “ Call me Ishmael ” to the desolate ending , this novel will change the way you view the world if you stick with it .
02 of 05 ' Pride and Prejudice ' CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform " Pride and Prejudice " is a kind of literary Rosetta Stone ; it 's the inspiration , basis , and model for so many modern novels that you ’re probably more familiar with its plot and characters than you think .
For a book written in the early 19th century , it ’s modernity is surprising until you realize that this is the novel that , in many ways , defined what a modern novel is .
One of the great things about " Pride and Prejudice " is that Jane Austen was such a natural writer that you do n’t see any of the techniques and innovations she used — you just get a great story about marriage , social class , manners , and personal growth and evolution .
In fact , it ’s such a well - constructed story that it ’s still stolen ( and left practically intact ) by modern authors , with the most obvious example being the " Bridget Jones " books where author Helen Fielding seemed to make no effort to disguise her inspiration .
Chances are if you ’ve enjoyed a book about two people who seem to hate each other at first and then discover they ’re in love , you can thank Jane Austen .
Why You Must Read It :
If you ’re still unconvinced , there are two other reasons we urge you to read " Pride and Prejudice : " The language .
This is one of the most sharply written novels ever composed ; you can enjoy the novel solely for its language and wit , beginning with its epic opening line :
“ It is a truth universally acknowledged , that a single man in possession of a good fortune , must be in want of a wife . ”
This is one of the most sharply written novels ever composed ; you can enjoy the novel solely for its language and wit , beginning with its epic opening line :
“ It is a truth universally acknowledged , that a single man in possession of a good fortune , must be in want of a wife . ”
The story .
Put simply , you could tweak " Pride and Prejudice " for some anachronisms in language and technology and the story still plays in the modern world .
In other words , things have n’t changed much when it comes to marriage , relationships , or status since Austen ’s day .
03 of 05 ' Ulysses ' Penguin Books
If there ’s a book that inspires fear in the hearts of people everywhere , it ’s James Joyce ’s " Ulysses , " a huge tome stained with the term “ postmodern . ”
And , real talk , it is one of the most difficult novels ever written .
Chances are if you know nothing else about the book , you know that " Ulysses " used the “ stream of consciousness ” method before the term existed .
( Technically , Tolstoy used something similar in " Anna Karenina , " but Joyce perfected the technique with " Ulysses . " )
It is also a sprawling novel dense with allusions , wordplay , obscure jokes , and intensely , opaquely personal ruminations by the characters .
Here ’s the thing :
All those puzzles and riddles and ambitious experiments also make this book awesome and fun .
The trick to reading " Ulysses " is simple : Forget it ’s a classic .
Forget it ’s so important and so revolutionary and you 'll feel less pressure when reading .
Why You Must Read It : Enjoy it for the hilarious , rambling epic it is .
If that 's not enough , here are two more reasons :
The humor .
Joyce had a wicked sense of humor and a big brain , and the ultimate joke of " Ulysses " is that he borrowed the structure of Homer ’s epic poetry to tell a series of jokes about sex and bodily functions .
Sure , the jokes are phrased in a riddling literary style and you will need the internet to look up references , but the key is that this novel does n’t take itself too seriously , and neither should you .

The difficulty .
Do n’t worry if you read it and do n’t understand a word of it the first time — if someone tells you they understand everything in this book , they are lying to you .
That means when you pick up " Ulysses , " you 're joining a worldwide club of people who have chosen to do something difficult but ultimately rewarding .
04 of 05 ' To Kill a Mockingbird ' Harper Perennial
One of the most deceptively simple novels ever written , " To Kill a Mockingbird " is often dismissed as a charming look at a young girl named Scout ’s first brush with adult concerns in 1930s small - town Alabama .
The adult concerns , of course , are horrifying racism and entrenched meanness among the white citizens of the town ; the story centers on a black man accused of raping a white woman , with Scout ’s father Atticus taking on the legal defense .
Sadly , the issues of racism and an unfair legal system are as applicable today as they were in 1960 , and that alone makes " To Kill a Mockingbird " a must - read .
Harper Lee ’s fluid , clear prose manages to be thoroughly entertaining while subtly examining the attitudes and beliefs under the surface that allow prejudice and injustice to persist to this day .
Lee shows us , to our horror , that there are still plenty of people out there who secretly ( or not so secretly ) harbor racist beliefs .
Why You Must Read It : Sure , a book published in 1960 and set in the 1930s might not sound so compelling — but here are two things to consider :
It still feels modern .
In some ways , we ’re all Scout Finch .
In the novel , part of Scout ’s growing up is realizing that the people in her town — people she thought were good and righteous — are deeply and disappointingly flawed .
For a lot of people in this country today , that ’s exactly how we feel when we turn on the news .

For a lot of people in this country today , that ’s exactly how we feel when we turn on the news .
It 's a cultural key .
" To Kill a Mockingbird " is referenced ( subtly and obviously ) in so much of our culture that you 're missing out if you 're not familiar with the book .
Once you read it , you 'll start seeing it everywhere .
05 of 05 ' The Big Sleep ' Perfection Learning Raymond Chandler ’s classic 1939 novel is n’t often cited on lists like these ; nearly a century after its publication it ’s still regarded in some circles as “ pulp : " trashy , disposable escapism .
It ’s true that the book is written in what modern audiences see as a self - consciously tough style , peppered with old - fashioned slang .
The plot is also famously complex , even for a mystery , and actually has several loose ends that never get resolved .
Why You Must Read It : Do n't let these complexities dissuade you .
We suggest you read this book for two reasons :
It ’s the template .
Whenever you hear “ hard - boiled ” or “ noir ” dialog or descriptions today , you ’re hearing second - and third - hand imitations of " The Big Sleep . "
Chandler ( along with a few other contemporaries like Dashiell Hammett ) more or less invented the hard - boiled detective story .

Chandler ( along with a few other contemporaries like Dashiell Hammett ) more or less invented the hard - boiled detective story .
It ’s beautiful .
Chandler has a style that is simultaneously violent , bleak , and gorgeous — the whole book reads like a tone poem with violence and greed as its subject .
Coupled with its status as the original , it ’s the one detective story everyone has to read no matter what they normally think about mysteries .
GREENBELT , Md. -
A team of astronomers has discovered a cosmic explosion that seems to have come from the middle of nowhere -- thousands of light - years from the nearest galaxy - sized collection of stars , gas , and dust .
This " shot in the dark " is surprising because the type of explosion , a long - duration gamma - ray burst ( GRB ) , is thought to be powered by the death of a massive star .
" Here we have this very bright burst , yet it 's surrounded by darkness on all sides , " says Brad Cenko of the California Institute of Technology , Pasadena , Calif. , lead author of the team 's paper , which has been accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal .
" The nearest galaxy is more than 88,000 light - years away , and there 's almost no gas lying between the burst and Earth . "
The blast was detected on January 25 , 2007 , by several spacecraft of the Inter - Planetary Network .
Observations by NASA 's Swift satellite pinpointed the explosion , named GRB 070125 for its detection date , to a region of sky in the constellation Gemini .
It was one of the brightest bursts of the year , and the Caltech / Penn State team moved quickly to observe the burst 's location with ground - based telescopes .
Using the team 's robotic 60 - inch telescope at Palomar Observatory in Calif. , the astronomers discovered that the burst had a bright and fast - fading afterglow in visible light .
This prompted them to observe the afterglow in detail with two of the world 's largest telescopes , the 8 - meter Gemini North telescope and 10 - meter Keck I telescope , both near the summit of Hawaii 's Mauna Kea .
What came next was a total surprise .
Contrary to experience with more than a hundred previous GRBs , Gemini spectra revealed no signs of dense gas and dust absorbing the light of the afterglow .
A trace of magnesium revealed that the burst took place more than 9.4 billion years ago , as deduced by the shift in wavelength of the afterglow 's light , and that the surrounding gas and dust was more tenuous than the environment around any previous burst .
To further pin down the environment that could produce such an unusual explosion , the group obtained Keck images of the location of GRB 070125 long after its afterglow light had faded away .
Surprisingly , the resulting images showed no galaxy at this location .
" A Keck image could have revealed a very small , faint galaxy at that distance , " says coauthor Derek Fox of Penn State .
Astronomers have amassed a great deal of evidence that GRBs are triggered by the explosive deaths of massive stars , which live very short lives .
Because of their short lifespans , massive stars do n't have time to wander far from their birthplaces , usually dense clouds of gas and dust inside respectable - size galaxies .
So GRB 070125 raises the perplexing question of how a massive star could be found so far away from any galaxy .
" Big stars live fast and die young , without much time to move around , " says Fox .
" So if this massive star died far away from any galaxy , the key question is , how did it manage to be born there ? "
The formation of massive stars requires similarly massive aggregations of gas and dust , which are usually found in bright galaxies .
One possibility is that the star formed in the outskirts of an interacting galaxy , as seen in the famous Hubble Space Telescope picture of the " Tadpole " galaxy , UGC 10214 .
" In the local universe , about one percent of star formation happens in tidal tails , on the outskirts of two interacting galaxies , " says Cenko .
" So it might even make sense to find one in 100 gamma - ray bursts in such an environment . "
If this idea is correct , it should be possible to detect the tidal tail hosting GRB 070125 by taking a long exposure with the Hubble Space Telescope .
" That 's definitely our next stop , " says Cenko .
" Many Swift discoveries have left astronomers scratching their heads in befuddlement , " adds Swift lead scientist Neil Gehrels of NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Md. " But this discovery of a long GRB with no host galaxy is one of the most perplexing of all . "

Memories of 20 Years of Perl
Proving Them Wrong
Around 1991
I wrote a very useful program , in C , which took a bunch of files and then sorted them into groups according to which files had identical contents .
A lot of sysadmins at the time wrote to thank me for it .
But when I boasted about it at Usenix that year , people told me “ oh , you should have written then in Perl . ”
That was pretty annoying , so I got the Camel Book ( pink in those days ) so that I could learn Perl and prove that they were wrong .
But it turned out that they were right .
Mark Dominus is the author of Higher - Order Perl
My First CGI Program
It was the year 2000 , and I was working at a software startup in San Francisco .
I was tasked with writing a simple form handler with an auto thank you email .
I had been a C programmer for several years , a Fortran programmer for a few , and this was essentially my first Perl program .
It was your standard CGI gateway which presented a form to the user , did some error checking , and sent a thank you email to the user .
After a few hours of learning Perl and putting my form handler together , it was put live on our website .
I was delighted that I was able to pick up this language so quickly and produce results in a short period of time .
I never like programming C that much ( although that has changed ) , due the fact that it got in my way .
Perl just worked .
I came into work the next day and reviewed how my program was doing .
It turns out that my first bug had surfaced ; the thank you email function managed to get caught in a loop .
One poor soul who filled out my form had received 800 thank you emails !
I was able to quickly fix the bug .
In honor of my first Perl program , I would like to extend a hearty 800 thank yous to the Perl community !
I have been using Perl ever since and love it .

Perl and the University Student
One cannot imagine how useful Perl proves sometimes to a university student .
I can recall several occasions in which I used Perl to facilitate a task or check my homework .
Of them , there is one that I still remember very clearly .
It was the course “ Introduction to Computer Networks ” and we learned about the various variations of networking protocols ( Stop - and - wait , Go- back - N , and Selective - Repeat ) .
We were given a simulation of these protocols written in C and compiled to run on Windows .
The simulation could be ran with several parameters and would output a verbose file with the parameters of the simulation , the simulation itself and then some statistics of the simulation .
We ran the program several times and got several files in return .
Now we had to somehow insert the statistics into Excel so we can analyze them , process them , and create charts out of them .
But the statistics were scattered over several different files , all with the same format , but nothing that Excel can understand ( at least not without a massive amount of Visual Basic for Applications code ) .
Without thinking for a moment , I started writing a Perl script that will process the files , extract the corresponding data and output a tab - delimited file that can be inputted into Excel .
It took some time to write the script , and meanwhile my partner decided it may be faster to do it by hand .
Thus , he occupied the nearby station , and started extracting the data himself .
I finished a few minutes after that , though , ( while he was just beginning in his manual labour ) and we were able to input the data into Excel and continue the assignment .
It took about 15 minutes or less , all in all .
Later on I talked to a few fellow students about the assignment .
One of them claimed it took him 3 hours to input everything into Excel . (!)
Another said it took him one hour , which is still much worse than 15 minutes .
Needless to say , none of them knew Perl .
Enough said .

How To Become a Guru
In early 1999 I started a new job as a system administrator .
In my previous position I ’d taught myself Unix and GNU / Linux , and ended up writing a small tracking application for a customer service group in Java .
As a new SA , I took over a pile of work from my predecessor , including some small Perl programs he ’d downloaded , installed , and modified to add his name to the comments .
Over the next couple of months , I picked up the Camel and the Perl Cookbook , and taught myself enough Perl that I could skim comp.lang.perl.moderated and answer some of the questions in my head .
About that time , I started to do a little work on the Everything Engine – not much , but a little bit – and so I was the second external person to register on PerlMonks when it started .
In those days there was no voting , no XP , and there were just a few people racing to reach the milestone of a hundred posts .
In between troubleshooting problems at work , I ’d play with little programs , read whatever tutorials or books I could get , and answer any question I could on the site , and so I learned Perl that way .
I remember the rush to find an idea – any idea – worthy of putting on the CPAN , and thinking in 2000 that every problem that anyone could solve , someone had already solved .
I remember my first patch to Perl 5 , then realizing that I had n’t actually run the tests , and resolving to improve the tests because they did n’t actually do what they said they should .
I remember getting job offers from my postings , and meeting some of the top Perl programmers in the world for the first time , and being accepted because I did ( some of the ) things I said I would , just because no one else was doing them .
That , I think , is the secret to become a contributing member of any community .
Look for something that needs someone to do it and do it .
You do n’t have to have permission , just a little bit of determination and stubbornness and some time .
I ’m a little sad that I missed the first eleven years of Perl ’s life , but I ’m glad to have caught up in the past nine years .

How an English Major Saved Christmas
Right before Christmas of 1998 I was a fairly new employee at Amazon.com .
Not a CS grad hacker with 30,000 shares , but an English grad customer service rep with 250 .
I knew about the 29,750 share disparity from picking up a fax for a star employee in the apps group .
Instead of letting it get to me , I started to look into why it was so .
I bought Learning Perl and spent two of the most painful weeks of self - edification in my life discovering how the lack of chmod +x was preventing me from getting through Chapter 2 .
Free at last I wrote , in two days , a badly needed and overlooked tax + shipping costs calculator for customer service for the new product tab launching that week .
It was the kind of script that would take any decent Perl hacker 30 minutes .
A former art critic saved hundreds of reps and tens of thousands of customers a lot of time and aggravation .
I got the company ’s “ Just Do It ” Award .
If it had been C or Java or anything but Perl I would n’t have been able to do it .
If I ’d come to anything but Perl , I would not have returned to coding –I dabbled in BASIC and Assembly as a kid–and I wouldn�t be a software developer today .

Smells Like Wet Camel
Standing out in my memory is the day in college ( either in late 1993 or early 1994 ) when my grandmother had emergency eye surgery .
Originally , she only had a regularly scheduled checkup , and my mother could take her to the appointment before work began , but not pick her up .
The doctor was one street over from the college ( more or less ) and I was conscripted to go over and take her home after her appointment and my first class .
The day was rainy , increasing in intensity as the day grew older .
Everything changed when I arrived at the doctor ’s office , because the doctor had found something that required immediate attention .
She had to be taken to a specialist immediately , and I began improvising .
Each eye appointment took a long time , and they would only get longer as my grandmother was worked in to the specialist ’s schedule as an emergency patient .
So I had time to take her to the next appointment , leave her to wait for what might be hours , go to my next class , eat lunch , and come back and get her .
I was trying to keep up with my college work , and brought my O’Reilly Perl book along so I could work on my computer science project , figuring I might as well do something useful while I was sitting around .
My project involved writing an e-mail processing system in Perl , so I had bought what was for me at the time an almost impossibly expensive book to help me learn the language .
On the way to the car , in the hardest and coldest rain I can ever remember , I was trying to help my grandmother and juggle the umbrella , car keys , car door , and everything else .
The book slipped out from under my arm and landed in a puddle .
Somehow , it landed on its edge , and had about an inch of muddy water soak into it .
My new book !
Ruined !
Nothing to do but keep going , to the next appointment , and back to my class .
I knew that to leave the college after eight a.m. was a guarantee of not being able to park anywhere near the building for the rest of the day , because the only parking spaces left were in the lower area of an overflow lot far from any building I needed to go to .
Without even a sidewalk near this lot , I had plenty of time to think about my ruined book and what was happening to my grandmother as I trudged through the mud , in the pouring rain , to get to my next class .
I also , in these days before mobile phones , had to find a pay phone to tell my mother about the abrupt change of plans .
My grandmother eventually got settled in the hospital , where it was at least dry , and she pulled through the eye surgery fine .
My waterlogged book with a brown bottom and hastily scribbled notes on the blank pages in the back was a good enough starting point ; I graduated .

“ I Could n’t Believe That Perl Even Worked ”
My first exposure to Perl was a web server with – I think – Perl 4.036 installed .
This would be 1995 or so .
I wanted to write CGI scripts so I started reading everything I could find about Perl .
I nearly lost heart when I read that the parser was , effectively , heuristic .
Coming from a background in Pascal and C I could n’t believe that Perl even worked .
Fortunately Perl was the only option for my script .
I persevered and discovered that – not only did Perl work – I rather enjoyed it .
Within two weeks I had a CGI script that implemented a kind of ad - hoc PHP : chunks of Perl embedded in HTML .
It was ugly – but Perl had made it possible .
At some time between then and now – after digressions into Java and even LotusScript – Perl became my main language .
At the end of 2006 I decided to concentrate on Perl , release some modules , proactively seek out things I did n’t know about the language and learn them .
As a result 2007 has been the happiest year of my professional career .
I ’ve written loads of code , most of which works .
I attended my first YAPC in Vienna and came home with a bunch of new friends and a renewed enthusiasm for cranking out code .
I ’ve still got plenty to learn .
Perl may be easy to pick up but mastery takes years .
And if you love programming that ’s part of the fun .
However good you think you are there ’s always a way to improve .
I dabble with other languages – because if you take programming seriously you must .
What do they know of Perl that only Perl know ?
There are things about Perl that grate .
It ’s not perfect but it ’s , well , loveable I suppose .
Thank you Perl community .
Thank you Larry .
Thank you for a lovely language .

From awk to perl
In early 1990 , I was working with a large set of data that needed to be massaged and formatted so that it could be statistically analyzed .
I started the task in awk , but quickly ran into trouble because awk could only open one file at a time .
A quick search through the Usenet comp.lang group found Perl 3.0 , which had just recently been released .
I had to get the source code and build it on my machine , but it compiled cleanly and I was able to try some simple stuff .
Worked real good too .
As I had already a large awk program , that I did n’t want to re-edit for Perl , I ran it through a2 p and the perl version produced the same results .
I was hooked .
When I got stuck , asking questions on comp.lang .
perl almost always got instant answers .
There has been an active perl community for a long time , and they were fabulous !
( Just like now ) .
I subsequently re-factored my code for perl and produced vast quantities of data to be analyzed .
I have been using Perl ever since .

Regime change was one of the stated goals of the invasion and occupation of Iraq .
Unlike cleansing the place of weapons of mass destruction and breaking up the alleged Baghdad - Al Qaeda nexus , it was a reality - based goal ; and , unlike the other two ( which were as unattainable and unnecessary as ridding the moon of green cheese ) , it was actually accomplished .
Saddam Hussein ’s regime has indeed been changed — though what it has been changed into , of course , is not quite what was intended .
TOM BACHTELL
And regime change , it turns out , is infectious — a militarily transmittable disease , almost invariably fatal , so far , to any political party or head of government so careless of hygiene as to have had intimate relations with the Bush Administration ’s Mesopotamian misadventure .
The contagion set in less than a year into the war , when , three days after the Madrid terrorist bombings of March 11 , 2004 , Spain ’s conservative government , which had sent thirteen hundred soldiers to Iraq , was defeated at the polls .
The soldiers were out within three months .
In May of 2005 , it was the turn of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi , of Italy , President Bush ’s loudest West European supporter , who had sent three thousand troops ; his successor , Romano Prodi , brought them home .
In June of this year , Tony Blair was finally obliged to relinquish his grip on Britain ’s Labour government , largely because of Iraq ; the new Prime Minister , Gordon Brown , has signalled that he intends to withdraw Britain ’s troops — some five thousand of the original commitment of forty - five thousand remain — by the end of 2008 .
Six weeks ago , Poland ’s premier , the twin brother of the country ’s President , lost to an opponent whose platform included bringing back the nine hundred Polish troops that are still in Iraq .
Other countries whose voters have dispensed with the services of leaders who enrolled them in Bush ’s “ coalition of the willing ” include Hungary , Ukraine , Norway , and Slovakia .
A week ago last Saturday , John Howard , the second - longest - serving Prime Minister of Australia , became the newest casualty of this political epidemic .
Howard ’s case is unusual , both for the slavishness with which he has followed Bush ’s lead and for the comprehensiveness of his defeat .
After a decade in office , and at a time of widespread economic contentment , his center - right coalition was decisively ousted at every level of government .
He even lost his parliamentary seat .
His fealty to Bush , not only on Iraq but also , and at least as important , on climate change , was , of course , not the only factor .
But it colored everything .
Two episodes helped solidify the public ’s fed - upness .
As close observers of our own election campaign may recall , the Australian Prime Minister greeted Barack Obama ’s entry into the Presidential race — and his proposal , at about the same time , for an American withdrawal from Iraq by next March — with a sneer .
“ If I was running Al Qaeda in Iraq , ” Howard said , “ I would put a circle around March , 2008 , and pray as many times as possible for a victory not only for Obama but also for the Democrats . ”
Kevin Rudd , then the leader of Australia ’s opposition , now Prime Minister - elect , gave him hell for this .
But the crispest rebuke came from Obama himself , who , after calling the attack flattering , said , “ I would also note that we have close to a hundred and forty thousand troops on the ground now , and my understanding is that Mr. Howard has deployed fourteen hundred .
So if he ’s ginned up to fight the good fight in Iraq , I would suggest that he call up another twenty thousand Australians and send them to Iraq .
Otherwise , it ’s just a bunch of empty rhetoric . ”
This point , which an Australian politician might find it awkward to make , exposed the gap between Howard ’s talk of the civilizational imperative of victory in Iraq and the relative paltriness of his commitment to that victory .
Australian troops have suffered zero combat deaths in Iraq to date .
Rudd plans to get them out before any occur .
He also plans to sign the Kyoto climate - change protocol in Bali this week , leaving the United States isolated as the only major Western country to reject it .
Then , in early September , Bush decided to drop in on the annual summit of the Asia - Pacific Economic Cooperation ( APEC ) group to give his old mate an electoral boost .
The event , which officially described itself as “ the most significant international gathering of an economic kind that Australia has hosted , ” was supposed to be the zenith of Howard ’s premiership .
It turned out to be the nadir .
He was humiliated when Kevin Rudd chatted with the President of China in perfect Mandarin .
He was humiliated when a popular TV satire troupe called the Chaser mounted a fake motorcade , flying a Canadian flag and featuring a rented limo with an actor dressed as Osama bin Laden in the back seat , and got within ten yards of Bush ’s hotel , making a mockery of an elaborate , war - on - terror - inspired security lockdown that had encased downtown Sydney in a “ ring of steel . ”
Bush , for his part , made a fool of himself ( and , by extension , of his host ) by calling APEC “ OPEC ” and Australian troops “ Austrian troops . ”
The Bush boost was a Bush bust .
They do n’t much like our President in the land Down Under .
In the most recent poll by Australia ’s Lowy Institute , huge majorities disapproved of American foreign policy in general ( sixty - three per cent ) and of George W. Bush in particular ( sixty - nine per cent ) .
But similar majorities take a positive view of America ( sixty per cent ) and Americans ( seventy - six per cent ) .
The rest of the world , alas , is not so discriminating .
According to Andrew Kohut and Bruce Stokes ’s “ America Against the World ” ( 2006 ) , based on the Pew Global Attitudes Project , there was a time , not so long ago , when foreigners “ found it easy to say their problem with America was really President Bush , not a considered judgment of the American people .
But the results of the 2004 U.S. presidential election made that rationalization untenable . ”
An avalanche of new international polls — from Pew , the German Marshall Fund , the BBC , and others — show that anti-Americanism has reached astronomical levels almost everywhere and has solidified even in the Northern European belt from Britain to Poland .
“ Countries that would once have supported American foreign policy on principle , simply out of solidarity or friendship , will now have to be cajoled , or paid , to join us , ” Anne Applebaum , a conservative commentator not given to sentimentality about “ world opinion , ” wrote recently in the Washington Post .
“ Count that — along with the lives of soldiers and civilians , the dollars and equipment — as another cost of the war . ”
Last week ’s gathering of Israeli and ( Sunni ) Arab leaders at Annapolis was a sign that it has finally dawned on the Bush Administration that its six - year policy of ignoring the Israeli - Palestinian morass has aggravated America ’s troubles in the Middle East .
The President may at last have realized that while the issue is not the sole cause of Islamist extremism , it cannot continue to fester––for the sake not only of Israeli survival and justice for the Palestinians but also of beginning to restore some of the global influence and esteem this Administration has squandered .
But in suddenly capping six years of obtuse neglect with a one - year timeline , President Bush has probably dithered too long to have any hope of solving the world ’s most complicated and persistent rebus .
His late awakening is yet another cost of the Iraq war .
Those costs keep mounting , and they ’re not likely to abate until there ’s regime change a little closer to home . ♦
When it comes to online purchases , you can simply open a new tab , type in ‘ promo code ’ and find a bunch of budgeting apps overflowing with promo codes .
But for offline shopping like groceries , can tech help you save money ?
You bet !
For most families , groceries are the second largest expense in the budget .
It ’s no surprise that saving on groceries is one of the first places that many people go to save a little extra cash .
However , it can feel a bit tricky , as no one wants to deprive their family of food to save money !
Thankfully , technology has made this a bit easier ; some apps can help you save money or will pay you to shop .
There are also many buying guides , such as this one for cheap earphones .
Check out our list of the four best grocery savings apps .
Grocery IQ
Grocery IQ is a powerful shopping list app that allows you to make a list from the millions of items in the database .
If you do n’t want to search through the database , you can add items through bar code scanning or voice recognition .
The app also offers coupons and has features that help you save money , making this a must - have tool for families that are short on time and money .
Ibotta
Ibotta offers thousands of rebates that are redeemable at over 50 retailers .
Shoppers skim through offers by category and complete certain tasks to have a pending rebate added to their account .
Duties involve things like watching a video or answering questions about your shopping preferences .
Once you buy the item , upload a copy of your receipt and scan the UPC and the money is available for you to send to PayPal whenever you want it .
Bonus offers and team offers can also help shoppers to boost the cash they get back considerably .
SnipSnap
SnipSnap is first and foremost a coupon app , and users can search thousands of coupons that are already online .
Unlike other apps , you can also take pictures and upload print coupons to use in - store , eliminating the need to clip coupons or bring them with you .
Only available for iOS .
SavingStar
SavingStar allows you to make better use of all of those store and loyalty cards .
When you use a card or coupons , the savings are applied to the SavingStar account and converted to cash .
Withdrawals are possible after you earn $ 5 .
For those who wish to give back , you can donate the money you receive through the app to individual charities .
One reason that these apps are so powerful is that they rely on things that you probably do already , like writing a list , or signing up for rewards programs , or using coupons .
These apps do n’t replace those ordinary activities , but instead , make them more efficient and increase their earning power leaving more time and money for you and your family .
FACT #1 :
With all the scientific information available on the negative side effects of doing drugs , it seems you 'd have to be an idiot or suicidal to try anything harder than the occasional sip of wine cooler .
But we 're living in a post - War on Drugs world ; we are the aftermath of Ronald " Leatherface " Reagan 's attempt at shaking the collective pockets clean of any sort of quasi-illegal drug related paraphernalia .
On the flip - side , our parents came up during the late ' 60s , early ' 70s , an era known for popularizing weed and cocaine and introducing LSD .
It 's shocking to know that LSD was still prescribed by psychiatrists until 1966 .
Though modern day psychiatrists are known for over - prescribing between ADD and depression medications , that does n't even get close to approaching the hilarity of being prescribed LSD .
It 's like , " You 're feeling down ?
Well , lick the back of this Mickey Mouse sticker and get ready to think you 're flying through a cloud of butter .
That 'll take those blues away right quick . "
Now , I 'm not condoning drug use .
It 's clearly bad for you .
Just about every major drug fucks up your brain and liver and even weed , often cited by burnout loser dickheads as being " all natural , " can give you some serious lung cancer .
Dude , just cuz something grew up from the ground does n't mean lighting it on fire and then breathing in the smoke wo n't mess you up real good .
It 's not like you 're not gonna die from smoke inhalation if you lay on the ground during the middle of forest fire .
Because you are , you white dredlock - having motherfucker .
But the fact that drugs are bad for you only makes them cooler .
Shit that 's bad for you is cool .
Getting strung out and endangering your life might not be the coolest thing in the world , but it 's certainly cooler than sitting a few yards away from someone getting drugged out , frowning at them .
It 's certainly true we 're more prudent and safer than our parents on this topic .
But we 're definitely lames as well .
FACT # 2 :
Here 's something with no caveats , no exceptions , no nothing ... this is a flat out fact .
The coolest mainstream artists recording right now are probably The White Stripes and Beck , and both are barely mainstream as it is .
That , versus our parents ' typical radio selection -- The Beatles .
The Who .
The Rolling Stones . Pink Floyd .
Led Zeppelin . Jimi Hendrix .
Dylan .
Dude , just stop me , because it 's getting depressing .
The mainstream , RADIO music our parents got to listen to as CASUAL listeners blows anything we 've got now out of the water .
And this fact keeps getting truer ( and sadder ) as time goes on .
Kids now are listening to Justin " Testicle Breath " Timberlake , R " Piss Breath " Kelly and Linkin " Testicles covered in Piss and Poo Breath " Park .
The music scene is depressing both fiscally and creatively .
Our parents have our asses checkmated on this one .
FACT # 3 :
Next time you 're at your parents ' house , dig up some old pictures of them .
Not the crap with you and your siblings in it , not the BS with your dad in a suit or your mom at pottery class .
Look deep , for those old yellowed pictures .
Now look at your dad 's face in those pix .
More likely than not , he 's got an amazing beard or mustache .
Now rub your hand over your bald patch of shame , right under your nose , where that amazing mustache should be .
You 're a failure .
Actually , it 's pretty hard these days to maintain sweet ass facial hair .
If it 's not an employer barring you from growing a lip warmer , it 's your girlfriend .
Or , if you live in San Francisco , New York , LA or Miami , it 's for the fear of being mistaken for someone named Brucie or Lance .
There 's every reason not to grow some carpet thick lip - perpillars .
But that still does n't hide the fact that your dad had the cool and collected confidence to harvest his own private garden of manliness smack dead on his face , for the world to see .
And you 've gotta face it ... in the facial hair department , he was cooler .
FACT # 4 :
Are you a serious movie buff ?
Do you consider Stanley Kubrick , Francis Ford Coppola and Woody Allen some of your favorite directors ?
Well , they were making all their good movies when our parents were our age .
Now , this fact might be a bit controversial with some -- many people consider the class of directors from the '60s and ' 70s overrated and they 're more in love with the later mavericks like Steven Spielberg and George Lucas .
That 's totally understandable .
But even these guys were doing their best work during the late ' 70s , early ' 80s ( still before our time , for the most part ) .
I also think a lot of the movies coming out now , stuff ranging from Tarantino to Apatow , is excellent work .
I can watch " Pulp Fiction " fifteen times in a row without getting sick and the same can be said for " 40 - Year - Old Virgin . "
But if you 've ever seen Tarantino on a late night talk show or read an Apatow interview , you 'd have to give it to me that these guys are straight dorks .
Amazing directors , yes .
But straight dorks .
That 's tooootally fine because I 'm a dork too , as are most of you guys .
But dudes like Sam Peckinpah , Robert Altman , they din't have one shred of nerdiness .
Even Woody Allen was banging hotter chicks than Judd Apatow , his modern day equivalent .
The situation with our movies is nowhere near as hopeless as our music , but the fact still remains that our parents ' generation had cooler flicks and cooler filmmakers .
Bladow !
FACT # 5 :
This is sort of like the " they did more drugs " one but having more sex is clearly cooler ( for the most part ) than doing more drugs .
You know the drill -- there was n't as much information telling people not to have sex , there was no AIDS until the tail end of our parents ' " loose period " and even then it was still mostly in the gay community and , most importantly , free love was the message of the day .
I mean , yes , college was fun for sexual enlightenment and all , but getting chicks to agree to sex was still SOME work .
Now imagine the summer of ' 69 .
Or even better , ask your dad how he did that summer .
And get ready to shit yourself .
My dad has recalled numbers in the hundreds from that summer alone , all disease and pregnancy free and all basically given to him without so much as an eyebrow raised at the chicks in question before receiving an offer to get down .
Somewhere in the ' 80s , all these chicks got professional and frigid , but until then , seeing tits and muff was n't something you worked towards .
It was expected .
God damn you , Women 's movement !
Now I have to worry about how sober I am , how sober she is , the right way to ask her , whether or not she 's on the pill , whether or not I have a condom , where I 'll be having this sex ( another detail my dad did n't have to worry about ... people were screwing in the parks en masse back then , dude ) ... it's all so hard these days , and oh so depressing .
Again , I of course think it 's great that women are more in tune with their own feelings these days , that they 're more liberated from the feelings of servitude and sexual duty to us guys , etc .
I think women as second class citizens is total bullshit .
But all this amounts to everyone ( women included ) busting far fewer nuts ( yes , women can bust nuts too ... right ? ) .
Which makes us toootally uncool , dude .
In the end , it seems , progress makes you lame .
I mean , the internet is making us lamer than our parents too .
DVD players , video games ... all the new diversions are nowhere near as cool as a game of beer league softball like my dad used to play .
But in the end , I 'll just admit I 'm not as cool as my dad , count my money , enjoy my possessions and take comfort in knowing that I 'm a square .
Yes , I 'm undersexed .
But I 'm overpaid .
And that 's what counts , son .

Ex Greenpeacer Patrick Moore lays the smackdown on the libtards and general anti-science morons in Hollywood .
If that is n't a double positive .
Key paragraphs :
He also makes the excellent point that 500 year old furniture is still , get this , binding the carbon .
Like Jane Fonda 's thighs , only firmer .
But 250KG of carbon / m3 . Like Al Gore 's stomach or Silky Pony Edward 's Carolina manse .
Amazing , really .
And while I think man -made climate change is as enduring a notion as zoom pants on straight men , this paragraph makes a lot of sense :
The reason I think it makes sense is because even very poor countries can grow trees successfully and learn from this free market solution for producing construction materials .

Last month China launched its first lunar orbiter
Rocket designer Long Lehao told state media scientists were on track to send " a small - scale 20 - ton space workshop " into the Earth 's orbit .
Space officials later said the plan had not been finalised .
The claim follows the launch of China 's first Moon probe last month , amid what some analysts are calling an undeclared space race with Japan and India .
Since Russia 's
Mir station was decommissioned in 2001 , the only such facility in operation is the International Space Station - a joint project of 16 nations .
Mr Long 's comments were carried widely in Chinese media , but a space official later suggested the plans were not so definite .
" China at present has not decided on developing a space station , " said Li Guoping , of the China National Space Administration .
Rocket breakthrough
Mr Long told the China Daily newspaper that the station was the third and final step in China 's manned space programme .
The first stage was a manned flight in 2003 and the second would come in 2008 , when astronauts are expected to walk in space .
" It is the first time a timetable has been made public for the building of the first space station , " the China Daily quoted Mr Long as saying .
Mr Long said he was optimistic about the launch of the space station because of breakthroughs in Chinese rocket technology .
The new Long March V carrier rockets , which can carry heavier loads , are expected to be ready for testing in 2013 , he said .
The BBC's Dan Griffiths , in Beijing , says China 's rapid move into space is aimed at boosting national pride and international prestige .
But earlier this year , Beijing triggered international concern by using a ground - based missile to destroy a weather satellite as part of a weapons test .
Other countries in the region are also expanding and accelerating their space programmes .
Japan launched a lunar orbiter last month and India is planning to follow suit in April next year .
Such moves are fuelling claims of an undeclared Asian space race .

The eggplant is neither oval in shape nor white , and certainly bears no relation to the egg in taste or in usage .
“ Eggplant , ” then , is a misnomer ?
Well , almost .
The first eggplants to reach Europe during the Middle Ages were actually a rare white species , with oval fruits that closely resemble a hen ’s egg .
The name eggplant was a natural , and stuck to the plant even when the more common purple varieties made their appearance in Europe .
The eggplant was once known as the “ love apple ” in England because it was thought to possess aphrodisiac properties .
Botanists in northern Europe dubbed the eggplant mala insana , or “ mad apple , ” because they thought that eating the fruit could result in insanity .
Curiously , the French call the eggplant aubergine , related to the word auberge , or “ inn . ”
Fruit ?
Yes , the eggplant is botanically a fruit , although the plant is used almost exclusively as a vegetable .
The eggplant is , to be exact , the Solanum melongena , a member of the nightshade family closely related to the tomato and potato .
Specimens range in size from the large fruit eaten in America to tiny Near Eastern varieties which happen to be more strongly flavored than the eggplants we customarily enjoy .
In addition to the familiar purple variety , there are white and yellow varieties , and a dwarf species whose fruits grow only three or four inches long .
A peculiar variety called the snake eggplant produces narrow , elongated fruits up to a foot in length with their ends curled up like a serpent ’s tongue .
The eggplant originated in India and eastern Asia , and has been cultivated since remotest history .
One of the oldest references to the fruit appears in a fifth - century Chinese book , which describes how fashionable Oriental ladies used a black dye made from eggplants to stain and polish their teeth .
The “ mad apple ” has been a particular favorite in the Near East since Biblical times .
The ancient Persians stuffed eggplants , and the Arabs scorched them over charcoal and crushed the flesh into a puree .
During the early Middle Ages , the Arabs brought the eggplant to Spain and Greece .
The fruit was first mentioned in northern Europe by Albert of Cologne in the thirteenth century , but it was not well known there until the sixteenth century .
The first eggplants began appearing on English dinner plates around 1587 .
Initially , the English called the fruit “ Guinea squash , ” since it was brought to London by traders in West Africa .
The Spaniards brought the eggplant to America during the seventeenth century .
But most of the eggplants grown here until this century , were used exclusively for ornament .
The eggplant , incidentally , is one of the few items of produce grown in the United States that also thrives in the tropics .
Eggplants are now extensively cultivated in east and southern Asia , as well as in Africa , South America , southern Europe , and the United States .
Requiring strong , steady sunshine , the plant is rarely grown outdoors in England or northern Europe .
Most American eggplants come from Florida , Texas , and New Jersey .
About a million and a half bushels of eggplants are produced here each year , and smaller quantities are imported , chiefly from Mexico .
But the average American , by and large , shuns the eggplant , consuming but four ounces of the fruit per year .
Eggplants are edible from the time they are one - third grown , and are usually picked before they reach maturity .
Plants are often started in protected beds , then transplanted to the garden or field .
Ripe eggplants are eaten raw , pickled , or cooked .
The cooked fruit is favored for its similarity in texture to meat , and many dishes , the Italian Eggplant Parmigiana , for instance , are prepared like meat dishes , with cheese , sauce , and spices .
The versatile eggplant can be baked , broiled , scalloped , fried , sauteed , stuffed , or marinated .
Italy , Greece , France , and several eastern countries all have their favorite eggplant dishes .
In the Near East , large eggplants are stuffed with meat , or pureed into a dip , or diced and mixed with onions , tomatoes , and garlic .
The Italians like to slice the fruit and saute it in olive oil , with plenty of tomato sauce .
A Sicilian specialty is melanza caponata .
The French enjoy ratatouille , a baked vegetable casserole with tomatoes , peppers , onions , and zucchini .
Many Japanese dishes call for eggplant .
In fact , the eggplant is the fourth most important “ vegetable ” in Japan , after the sweet potato , radish , and Chinese cabbage .
The popular Greek dish moussaka , made from eggplant , lamb , onions , and spices , originated in the early Middle Ages .
Another eggplant dish , Imam Bayaldi , owes its name to sixteenth century Ottoman Turks .
Acccording to a legend , a holy man , or Imam , was served a particular eggplant dish by a beautiful woman .
When she bent over to present the dish , her veil slipped from her face for a moment .
The holy man , captivated by this brief glimpse of her beauty , and overwhelmed by the aroma of the succulent food , simply passed out .
The dish Imam Bayaldi was then christened “ the priest has fainted . ”
When you shop for eggplants , look for firm fruits of uniform color .
The best eggplants are heavy in relation to their size .
Avoid wilted or soft eggplants , or fruits marked with brown spots which may indicate decay .
“ Mad apples ” are also excellent plants for a kitchen garden , so you might test your purple thumb with a small crop .
Experts advise that you start the seeds indoors and transplant them to the garden only when the daily temperatures reach the seventy - degree range .
They say you can serve eggplants with any dish .
How about eggplant and eggs ?
HONG KONG , Nov 28 ( Reuters ) - Physical barriers , such as regular handwashing and wearing masks , gloves and gowns , may be more effective than drugs to prevent the spread of respiratory viruses such as influenza and SARS , a study has found .
The findings , published in the British Medical Journal , came as Britain announced it was doubling its stockpile of antiviral medicines in preparation for any future flu pandemic .
Trawling through 51 studies , the researchers found that simple , low - cost physical measures should be given higher priority in national pandemic contingency plans .
" Mounting evidence suggests that the use of vaccines and antiviral drugs will be insufficient to interrupt the spread of influenza , " they wrote in the report .
The 51 studies compared any intervention to prevent animal - to - human or human - to - human transmission of respiratory viruses , such as isolation , quarantine , social distancing , barriers , personal protection and hygiene , to doing nothing or to other types of intervention .
They excluded vaccines and antiviral drugs .
They found that handwashing and wearing masks , gloves and gowns were effective individually in preventing the spread of respiratory viruses , and were even more effective when combined .
" This systematic review of available research does provide some important insights ...
There is therefore a clear mandate to carry out further large trials to evaluate the best combinations , " the international team of scientists wrote .
Another study , published in the Cochrane Library journal last month , found handwashing with just soap and water to be a simple and effective way to curb the spread of respiratory viruses , from everyday cold viruses to deadly pandemic strains .
Researchers have long warned that the world is due for another pandemic but they cannot say which strain will strike .
The H5N1 avian flu virus that has killed more than 200 people globally since 2003 is considered a prime suspect .

Who knew the Weasley family trademark — a shock of bright red hair — was tens of thousands of years old ?
Fictional wizards and J.K. Rowling aside , researchers Carles Lalueza - Fox of the University of Barcelona , Spain and Holger Rompler of the University of Leipzig in Germany announced last week that Neanderthals , who died out 35,000 years ago , had the same distribution of hair and skin color as modern human European populations .
By inference , that means that about 1 percent of Neanderthals must have been redheads , with pale skin and freckles .
The idea of Neanderthals with red hair and freckles is just plain charming .
But it 's also scary because it underscores the fact that Neanderthals were so much like us , and now they 're gone .
Ever since their fossils were first discovered in 1829 ( and later called " Neanderthal Man " by William King , who was part Irish , by the way ) , these hominids have been relegated to the status of cave men and women .
Neanderthals were shorter and more muscular than the other humans living at the same time , had bigger noses and projecting brow ridges , and no chins .
Not a pretty picture .
But these ancient fellow Europeans were also culturally sophisticated .
They buried their dead , built shelters , made tools , used fire and hunted .
The may have had language ( DNA sequencing has also revealed they carried the FOXP2 gene which is linked to language ability ) .
And they had brains 100 cubic centimeters larger than people today .
And so why have these interesting people been relegated to second - class citizen status ?
Because they threaten us .
Neanderthals are chronologically the closest , and the most familiar , example that we have of our kind disappearing off the face of the Earth , and that means we can go too .
No one knows exactly why Neanderthals went extinct , but the possibilities are also troubling .
They may have been wiped out by disease or bad weather .
Or overpopulated their habitat and run out of food , fuel , and decent water .
They may have once been the greatest society on Earth , but in their arrogance ignored the smaller - brained hominids ( that would be us ) on the other side of the hill and been caught off guard and slaughtered in the first genocide .
Perhaps Neanderthals were simply unable to adapt to changing times , unable to lift their blinders and see beyond their own borders to the march of humanity across the globe .
Neanderthals scare us because they are ghosts from the past , a few with wizardly Weasley hair and a sprinkle of freckles , and they are now turned in our direction whispering , " You 're not so unique .
Watch out . "

Exclusive to TLE
It 's time , once again , to talk about the minimum wage .
Or rather , it 's time to talk about why we 're still talking about it .
Why is this absurd law still with us ?
Why is it so popular ?
Why are the Democrats talking about the need to raise the minimum yet again ?
From an ethical perspective , the law is wrong .
From an economic perspective , it is damaging and dangerous .
And yet the emotional perspective the actual basis of most opinions has a strangle hold on well - intentioned people .
Let me elaborate the three 'E 's mentioned above :
E1 : Ethical alignment .
This is also known as one 's principled or moral position .
This is where we talk about right and wrong in our deepest sense of those words .
This is the focus of those who believe that the ends cannot justify the means .
E2 : Economic alignment .
This is also known as the practical , utilitarian , or consequentialist perspective .
Those who believe that the ends can justify the means would presumably care most about economics , the study of which means affect what ends .
E3 : Emotional alignment .
This is the realm of connotation , of symbolic alignment , which " side " you want to be on .
Emotional alignment is how people feel about an issue , and perhaps more important , how they feel about the people they associate with the different sides .
To take a position , I believe one needs to address the first two : the ethical and the economic .
To persuade someone , I think one needs to address all three .
We libertarians often neglect E3 .
While most people will claim to hold positions based on morality or on consequences , they really base their positions on symbolic - or emotional alignment : agreeing with " the good guys " and not wanting to side with " those people " etc .
E1 : The Ethics of the Minimum Wage
When debating the minimum wage law with an advocate , I used to address only E1 : the right of contract .
I did n't need to understand the economics of price fixing and the consequences for unskilled labor ; all that mattered was the right of individuals to engage in voluntary arrangements without the coercive influence of third parties .
If I own myself , then I own my labor .
If I own my labor , then I have a right to exchange it for whatever compensation I agree to , on whatever terms I agree to .
That 's my perspective as a worker .
My perspective as an employer would be the same : if someone is willing to do work for me at a price I find agreeable , then it 's nobody else 's business to interfere with our exchange .
This seems so straight - forward to me now that it takes a real effort to remember how I could ever have believed anything else .
E2 : The Economics of the Minimum Wage
As Jim Cox points out in his Concise Guide to the Minimum Wage , the question is n't whether a person will be employed at an hourly wage of $ X or something more than $ X ; the question is whether the person will be employed at $ X or unemployed at $ 0 .
In the past , when talking with a minimum wage advocate who did n't know any economics , I 'd try to sketch out a very quick lesson on how to produce shortages and gluts through price fixing .
I eventually realized that I was abstracting too much to hold their attention .
( See E3 , below . )
It has proven more useful to describe concrete examples .
When I was growing up in New York , buildings all over the Upper West Side had doormen .
They would welcome tenants and visitors in the lobby , and operate a manually controlled elevator to take them to their floor .
At some point in the late 1970s , the doormen went on strike .
I learned three things from this strike :
(1) It 's fun to operate an old - fashioned elevator when you 're a kid ;
(2) To give the doormen what they were asking would have meant that my family 's rent would have to go up ;
(3) It 's cheaper to install intercom systems and new push - button elevators than it is to pay the doormen more .
Everyone seems to understand why there are hardly any manually operated elevators left on the Upper West Side of Manhattan , but they do n't seem to generalize that understanding to labor and the minimum wage .
Similarly , there are many on the economic
Left who advocate excise taxes on cigarettes because they know that higher prices will discourage consumption of cigarettes .
They want higher gas taxes to lower the consumption of gasoline .
So why is it so hard to see that higher work prices will discourage the consumption of labor ?
Many people I talk to about the minimum wage seem unaware of any economic downside .
The mark of economic illiteracy is the failure to anticipate trade - offs .
But some minimum wage advocates do understand the economics of price fixing and do acknowledge that a rising minimum wage means an increase in unemployment .
So why do they still support the law ?
They point to labor statistics , which show that the unemployment effect is mostly on teenagers .
They claim that it is worth a rise in the wages of " bread winners " if the only downside is the loss of some part - time and summer jobs for kids .
They tend not to mention that these unemployed " kids " are mostly young black men , and that they are the least skilled and least educated among young black men .
These are the people most in need of on - the - job training !
Minimum wage advocates , mostly white so - called liberals , take for granted the very skills that these young men are now unable to learn on the job : punctuality , responsibility , communication , cooperation , etc .
Next time you hear someone decrying the plight of inner city youth , ask how different their futures would be if the bottom rungs had n't been removed from the economic ladder .
E3 : The Emotional Support of Minimum Wage Law
The most painful part in writing this is that nothing I 'm saying is new .
So why is this battle still being fought ?
Worse yet : why does it seem that we 're losing ?
Minimum wage is one of the absolute simplest issues to address rationally , and yet the irrational law enjoys overwhelmingly popular support .
Abstract arguments and ethical principles leave people cold .
They say that they are " results oriented " which would seem to imply a belief in the positive economic consequences of price fixing .
But when confronted with basic economic theory and history , they remain unconvinced .
Why ?
Because to them , minimum wage law feels right .
They do n't like thinking of someone working for less than $ X per hour .
To them , it therefore follows that no one should be allowed to hire a person for less than $ X per hour .
They do n't see it as a prohibition on labor ; they see it as a blow against the oppressive bosses !
They associate the libertarian position not with principle or conviction , but with cold hearts , greed , and selfishness .
What we call freedom of contract , they call exploitation .
What we call reason , they are convinced is merely rationalization .
This is emotional alignment .
Symbolic self - image .
People who seem to care about the poor tend to support minimum wage law ; therefore someone who wants to support the poor supports the position of that group .
It 's as if reality itself could be defined by majority rules .
" I am a progressive , therefore I support progressive legislation . "
Or , " The Christian position is X , and I'm a Christian , therefore I support X . "
It 's all based in the belief ( habit , reflex ) that an issue is n't about a principle , is n't about reason , but is always about whose side you 're on .
There 's management and there 's labor .
The rich and the poor .
Exploiters and exploited .
Minimum wage law is seen as siding with labor , siding with the poor , the underdog .
To oppose minimum wage law is to side with management , to support the rich over the poor .
And of course , the whole context is the damned Class Warfare assumption that Marx managed to plant in the brains of even the most ardent anti-communists .
An appreciation of market economics reveals the mutually beneficial nature of trade ( as would simple philosophical rigor ) , but our culture has been indoctrinated with the image of economics - as - warfare .
People believe that the rich take wealth from the rest of us , rather than creating wealth for the rest of us .
To side with the rich in our dichotomous symbology would be to side with the thief over the victim , and no amount of principled argument or even practical disproof will shake that impression out of someone 's head when it 's been lodged in there for so long .
What is to be done ?
Should libertarians abandon principles and persuasion in favor of symbolism and emotional manipulation ?
Perhaps we should focus more on public relations and advertising than on philosophy and economics .
No , there 's nothing wrong with E1 or E2 .
They are the realms of reason .
Abandoning our heads for our hearts leaves us with only arbitrary next steps .
But persuasion requires more than reason .
It might be less about teaching and more about helping people unlearn certain mental reflexes .
From now on , if I 'm going to discuss minimum wage law ( or any other regulation , prohibition , or legislation ) with a supporter , I 'll say up front that I 'm going to address three different perspectives on the same issue , and I 'll introduce them to the 3E approach .
There 's not much I can do to change someone 's symbolic alignment or their emotional reflexes , but by making these things an explicit part of the conversation , I can hope to reduce the hold they have on a person 's moral imagination .
A suicide bomber 's attack on an upscale Baghdad hotel Monday was a blow struck against the US plan to support and arm Sunni tribes in western Iraq .
The bomber walked up to a group of Sunni sheikhs and detonated his explosives belt .
Among the 12 people killed were four senior tribal members linked to an American effort to combat Al Qaeda in Anbar Province .
The US military says that its strategy of building ties with the tribes has been effective in reducing attacks .
But the approach is facing growing criticism from both Iraqi politicians and military experts .
Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki has complained that the initiative is creating militias outside its control and undermining his plan to strengthen the central government 's control over security forces .
" This may result in a temporary ally to help against Al Qaeda , but we are also creating more and better - armed militias , and we are working against what we have said is our principal reason for being [ in Iraq , ] which is to create and build up a strong central Iraqi government with a monopoly on handling the country 's security , " says Bruce Riedel , a career - long expert in the Middle East and counterterrorism with the Central Intelligence Agency and other federal agencies .
" This is a strategy fraught with risks , " he says .
Some US military officers are questioning the wisdom of the strategy of working with the coalition of tribes known as the Anbar Salvation Council .
Some officers in Iraq have noted they are now working with tribes whose members just a few months ago made up a large slice of the Iraqis they were arresting for attacks on US forces and other crimes .
But supporters say the strategy recognizes the reality of the tribes ' powerful role in Iraqi society .
Tribal sheikhs , or leaders , have already provided valuable intelligence about Al Qaeda operations and members in their areas .
The tribes are anxious to change sides , they say , because Al Qaeda has used mass - casualty tactics like car bombings that the tribes find anathema .
US reliance on tribes is also supported by others who have already written off the possibility of seeing a strong central Iraqi government emerge .
" I 've been pushing for four years to deal directly with the tribal leaders , " said Sen. Joseph Biden ( D ) of Delaware at a Monitor lunch in Washington Thursday .
The US , he added , has to " give up on … the possibility of having a strong central democratic government trusted by all the major constituencies ....
It 's simply not capable of occurring . "
If Iraq is , as President Bush says , the central front in an international war of terrorism , it may make sense to cast one 's lot with whatever forces in Iraq are best capable of working against a common enemy in that war – in this case Al Qaeda .
But the approach , some say , ignores the possibility that the new allies are enemies themselves of other US priorities in Iraq – or could eventually turn once again against the US .
Old enemies , new friends
" Most of these Sunnis who were formerly targeting US and coalition forces and are now willing to fight on our side are n't doing it as a result of some deep ideological transformation , " says Riedel , now at the Saban Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution in Washington .
" They are doing it for reasons of financing , to make money , and to control turf in the Sunni parts of the country .
It 's unlikely they will be reliable allies in the long term . "
As an example , Riedel points to one Anbar sheikh among the leaders of the front against foreign fighters " who essentially is a highwayman , " having worked with Al Qaeda to rob travelers on the Baghdad - Amman highway and divide the " take . "
" At some point such ' allies ' can be bought back by the opposing side , " he adds , " and then it becomes a bidding war . "
Mr. Maliki has said the plan could end up creating new militias for the government to contend with .
But government critics say what some see as US " desperation " might not have been necessary if Maliki had moved against militias in the first place .
Other government supporters say the US may unwittingly be arming sides in a future full - blown civil war .
Some point to history and note that attempts by outside powers to divide insurgencies by buying off factions does not have a good track record .
They cite French efforts in Algeria or similar attempts in Vietnam .
What seems clear is that tribal leaders across Iraq are fully aware of the " Anbar model " and are seeking to follow it – either to " cash in , " as critics say , or to help defeat Al Qaeda in Iraq .
A recent encounter in the provincial government offices in Kirkuk in northern Iraq provided emblematic , if anecdotal , evidence .
A Sunni sheikh jumped to his feet and heartily shook the hand of a stranger in the room he learned was an American visitor .
" Please take a message back to America , tell them all the sheikhs of Kirkuk do n't want Al Qaeda here any more , " he said .
Noting that tribal leaders in other parts of Iraq , particularly in Anbar , are uniting against Al Qaeda , the elegantly dressed elder said , " We are making the same effort here ; we do not accept others to impose their rule upon us . "
And then the sheikh from Hawija – a particularly troublesome area southwest of Kirkuk that US forces have had trouble wresting from insurgents – added , " We are willing to stop the progress here of the Al Qaeda group , and we will succeed with America 's help . "
Told later of the incident , one US officer said wryly , " Well , that 's nice to hear – because up till now I 've been doing more arresting of tribesmen with that sheikh 's name than cooperating with them . "
Attack on the Mansour Hotel
The suicide bomber who attacked the Mansour Hotel on Monday hit a Baghdad landmark , on the western bank of the Tigris River , where Iraqi politicians , news organizations , and diplomats are based .
The hotel is situated across from an abandoned building that housed the former Ministry of Information during the Saddam Hussein 's regime .
It 's a heavily secured area , with a checkpoint at the top of the road leading to the hotel and a vast metal gate at the entrance of the hotel itself .
Sheikh Rafai al - Fahdawi , a leading member of the Bu- Fahed tribe , which formally joined the Anbar Salvation Council in late April , said his cousin , Sheikh Abdul - Aziz al - Fahdawi , was killed in the attack , as was Sheikh Tariq Al - Assafi , head of the Bu- Assaf tribe , and former Anbar governor Sheikh Fassal al - Guood .
A leading Iraqi poet , Rahim al - Maliki , who had praised the tribal fight against Al Qaeda in his poems was also killed .
He had his own show on state television and several episodes focused on Anbar tribes .
Sheikh Abdul - Aziz helped lead a meeting of the Bu-Faheds on April 25 in which they urged all their kinsmen to stop cooperating with Al Qaeda and to punish and banish all those who cooperate with the terror network .
Sheikh Jabbar al - Fahdawi , one of the senior members of the tribe , had said in that meeting that they received some weapons from the US military but that they were looking for stronger support .
Gaining the support of the Bu- Fahed tribe was a coup for US military forces in the fight against Al Qaeda .
The tribe was among the staunchest supporters of Al Qaeda in Anbar .
Sheikh Rafai said that some of the tribal leaders killed in the Mansour blast had met with Maliki the night before to demand more support and a more active role for them in the province following their efforts to reduce the influence of Al Qaeda and regain the provincial capital , Ramadi , from its grip .
Ramadi was declared in October as the capital of the Islamic state of Iraq but is now controlled by US and Iraqi forces .
" The support of the government has been weak and not at the level desired , " he said in an interview Monday after the bombing .
He said it was unlikely that someone from within the tribe targeted the gathering and hinted that it might have been motivated by sectarian rivalries and carried out by militant Shiite parties that were not happy to see Sunni tribes gaining assertiveness and power .
" There are parties that do not care about the national interest .
This attack will only increase our resolve and determination , " he said .
Fierce debates have erupted over the wisdom of the US arming tribes and creating a " militia , " as the government and the US were hoping to re-create the success in Anbar elsewhere .
This prompted Maliki to issue a statement on Friday to clarify his position .
" The government does not fear the arming of the tribes , but it fears chaos and lack of discipline and the emergence of new militias .
Everything must be done under the auspices of Iraqi sovereignty and government supervision and within a national context . "
Some Basic Stuff : The Writer Monad
Edit : Clarified some of the code .
Edit II : Comment about laziness .
In this post , Magnus Therning gives a number of solutions to the n-queens problem in Haskell .
The problem is just to arrange n queens on an n x n chess board so that neither is threatening any of the others .
It ’s a classic problem that ’s solved with backtracking .
That is , you try something , and if it does n’t work you back up and try something else .
Simple enough .
It reminded me that when I was first learning Haskell , I wrote an n-queens solution using the Writer monad .
This monad just augments the pure functional environment with a new instruction called “ tell ” .
For those new to Haskell but with some knowledge of Python , consider it equivalent to Python ’s “ yield ” .
Here ’s the code :
import Control .
Monad import Control .
Monad .
Writer import Data .
List diagonal ( x1,y1 ) ( x2,y2 ) = x1 + y1 == x2 + y2 || x1 - y1 == x2 - y2 nqueens n = execWriter $ f [ 1..n ] 1 [ ] where f [ ] _ ps = tell [ ps ] f cs r ps = forM_ cs $ \c -> unless ( any ( diagonal ( r , c ) ) ps ) $ f ( delete c cs ) ( r + 1 ) ( ( r , c ) : ps )
And that ’s it .
The diagonal function determines if two positions ( as order pairs of row and column ) are diagonal from each other .
The nqueens function then uses execWriter to run something in the Writer monad and extract the list of answers that were “ told ” during its execution .
Then I call the workhorse function , which for lack of a better name is just called f .
This function assigns one queen to each row , from the top down .
It is recursive , so it tracks state in its parameters : the first is a list of free columns , the second is the row number , and the third is the list of positions where queens have been placed so far .
If there are no more free columns , then we must have placed all the queens , so we tell the solution .
If there are free columns , we loop through them and try putting a queen in each free column at the current row .
Formally , this returns a list of all solutions to the problem .
However , it ’s a lazy list ; so if you only use the first one , the remainder of the list will never be calculated .
So if you only want one solution , just do head ( nqueens 8 ) , and you ’ll get the first solution .
Okay , nothing phenomenal here .
Just a quick example of some Haskell code .
The kidnap and torture program of the Bush administration , with its secret CIA “ black site ” prisons and “ torture taxi ” flights on private jets , saw a little light of day this week .
I spoke to Mohamed Farag Ahmad Bashmilah in his first broadcast interview .
Bashmilah was a victim of the CIA ’s so - called extraordinary rendition program , in which people are grabbed from their homes , out of airports , off the streets , and are whisked away , far from the prying eyes of the U.S. Congress , the press , far from the reach of the courts , to countries where cruelty and torture are routine .
Bashmilah is being represented by the American Civil Liberties Union and by the New York University School of Law International Human Rights Clinic in a lawsuit with four other victims of CIA rendition .
They are suing not the U.S. government , not the CIA , but a company called Jeppesen Dataplan Inc. , a subsidiary of Boeing Corp .
A former Jeppesen employee , Sean Belcher , entered an affidavit in support of Bashmilah , reporting that Jeppesen executive Bob Overby bragged , “ We do all of the extraordinary rendition flights , ” further explaining to staff that he was speaking of “ the torture flights , ” and that they paid very well .
Through a translator , over the phone from his home in Yemen , Bashmilah described how his ordeal began on Oct. 21 , 2003 , when he was arrested in Amman , Jordan : “ It was approximately six days , but what I endured there is worth years .
They wanted me to confess to having some connections to some individuals of al - Qaida .
They tried several times to get me to confess , and every time I said no , I would get either a kick , a slap or a curse .
Then they said that if I did not confess , they will bring my wife and rape her in front of me .
And out of fear for what would happen to my family , I screamed and I fainted .
After I came to , I told them that ‘ please , do n’t do anything to my family .
I would cooperate with you in any way you want . ' ”
After signing a false confession , he was told he was going to be released .
In the process of being led through the Jordanian intelligence facility , he lifted his blindfold .
“ I saw another man who had a Western look .
He was white and somewhat overweight and had dark glasses on .
I realized then that they were probably handing me over to some other agency , because during the interrogations I had with the Jordanians , one of the threats was that if I did not confess , they will hand me over to American intelligence . ”
He was prepared for transit , stripped “ completely naked .
They started taking pictures from all directions .
And they also started to beat me on my sides and also my feet .
And then they put me in a position similar to the position of prostration in Muslim prayer , which is similar to the fetal position .
And in that position , one of them inserted his finger in my anus very violently .
I was in terrible pain , and I started to scream .
When they started taking pictures , I could see that they were people who were masked .
They were dressed in black from head to toe , and they were also wearing surgical gloves . ”
He says he was put in a diaper , had his eyes and ears covered , a bag was put over his head , and he had additional earphones put on his head to block noise .
He was then flown to Kabul , Afghanistan , where he was held in solitary confinement for close to six months .
He believed he was being held by Americans .
“ Some of the interrogators would come to me and interrogate me in the interrogation room , and they would tell me , ‘ You should calm down and be comforted , because we ’ll send all this information to Washington . ’
And they would say that in Washington , they will determine whether my answers are truthful or not . ”
Although kept isolated from other prisoners , he managed to overhear some of them speculating that they were being held at Bagram Air Base .
He went on to say that he was kept awake with blaring music and was held in shackles that were removed only for periodic interrogations .
While Bashmilah was being interrogated and tortured , he was also visited by “ psychiatrists . ”
“ [ T ] he therapy mainly consisted of trying to look at my thoughts and trying to interpret them for me , and in addition to some tranquilizers . ”
Bashmilah attempted suicide three times , staged a hunger strike that was painfully ended with a feeding tube forced down his nose , and was denied access to a lawyer , to any human - rights group , to the International Committee of the Red Cross .
In effect , he was disappeared .
On May 5 , 2005 , he was transferred to a prison in Yemen , where he eventually gained access to his family .
Amnesty International got involved .
He was released in March 2006 with no charges relating to terrorism .
Mohamed Bashmilah said there were cameras in his cells and interrogation rooms .
Perhaps tapes were made of his ordeal .
Let ’s hope that the CIA does n’t destroy these , too .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Stocks slumped Wednesday , with the Dow closing at a 7 - month low , as worries about the credit and mortgage market and higher oil prices hit investors hard ahead of what for many will be a long holiday weekend .
Treasury prices rallied , the dollar fell , oil prices edged lower and gold prices rose .
The Dow Jones industrial average ( Charts ) lost 211 points or 1.6 percent .
That set the Dow at its lowest point since April 17 , when it ended the session at 12,773.04 .
The S&P 500 ( Charts ) index lost 1.6 percent and the Nasdaq composite ( Charts ) lost 1.3 percent .
The stock selloff was very broad , with homebuilders , banks , mortgage lenders and technology shares leading the decline .
" Financials and housing have been a wet blanket on the entire market , " said Richard Sparks , senior equities analyst at Schaeffer 's Investment Research .
" We 're seeing the weight of the subprime worries and the credit crunch coming home to roost . "
All financial markets are closed Thursday for Thanksgiving and Friday 's abbreviated session ends at 1:00 p.m. ET .
Attendance Friday is expected to be low and trading volume light .
Despite the minimal market action on that day , Friday is key for stocks and the economy in that it is Black Friday , the kickoff for the critical holiday shopping season .
Worries about consumer spending , which fuels roughly two - thirds of the economy , have played a big role in the recent stock market decline .
Therefore , the results from retailers will be significant in determining whether stocks rebound in December or fall further .
" Everyone is going to be keying on the retail numbers and that could come down on either side of the fence , " Sparks said .
" If you have a poor start to the Christmas Season , you have real evidence of the economic slowdown , " he said .
" But if the consumer is resilient - although it may cause worries that the Fed wo n't have a good reason to cut rates - it might also placate investors worried about a recession . "
Stocks have been whipsawed lately as investors have muddled through the ongoing housing and credit market turmoil , eyed the weak dollar and fretted over oil prices near $ 100 a barrel .
On Tuesday the Fed issued a sluggish 2008 economic outlook , confirming other recent signs of a slowdown .
Wednesday 's index of leading economic indicators and consumer sentiment readings added to the lackluster growth outlook .
Additionally , the Mortgage Banker 's Association reported a 3.6 percent drop in applications last week .
Separately , 47 of the 50 states saw a drop in existing home sales in the third quarter , according to a National Association of Realtors report .
" Equity markets are reacting to the economic slowdown , " said Michael Strauss , chief economist at Commonfund .
" There is some worry about the consumer , about discretionary business spending and about the financial sectors of the economy . "
He said that there may also be some worry that the Federal Reserve is behind in addressing these issues , as was reflected by the steep decline in Treasury bond yields Wednesday .
Treasury prices jumped , lowering the corresponding yields , as investors sought safety in the safer haven of bonds .
The rally sent the benchmark 10 - year note below 4 percent , during the session , for the first time in two years .
" There 's a pretty strong flight - to - quality there , " Strauss said .
" There 's a clear bet that the Fed has further to go , even if the Fed does n't realize it . "
Policy makers meeting on Dec. 11 are widely expected to cut the fed funds rate , a key short - term interest rate by a quarter - percentage point .
Among stock movers , Freddie Mac ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) shares continued to slip after plunging nearly 27 percent Tuesday .
The government - sponsored mortgage backer reported a steep quarterly loss Tuesday and a $ 1.2 billion writedown due to credit losses .
Fellow mortgage lenders Countrywide Financial ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) and Washington Mutual ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) slipped too , while Fannie Mae ( Charts ) bounced back after sliding through the morning .
Big banks slumped , including Merrill Lynch ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) , Lehman Brothers ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) and Morgan Stanley ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) .
Declines were broad based , with 29 out of 30 Dow components falling , led by AIG ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) , American Express ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) , JP Morgan ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) , General Electric ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) and Intel ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) .
Intel was one of many chips falling , including Advanced Micro Devices ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) and Micron Technology ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) .
Micron slumped for a second session after a Morgan Stanley analyst initiated coverage of the company Tuesday with an " underweight " rating , AP reported .
The Dow 's lone advancer was GM ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) , which recovered from a steep morning selloff after reports said that GMAC , its struggling former finance unit , is taking steps to keep its mortgage unit alive .
Market breadth was negative .
On the New York Stock Exchange , losers beat winners by almost three to one on volume of nearly 1.61 billion shares .
On the Nasdaq , decliners topped advancers by seven to three as 2.07 billion shares changed hands .
In economic news , the October index of Leading Economic Indicators ( LEI ) fell 0.5 percent , after rising 0.1 percent in the previous month , suggesting that the economic slowdown could accelerate in the months ahead .
Economists surveyed by Briefing.com thought LEI would fall 0.3 percent .
The November consumer sentiment index from the University of Michigan showed a rise to 76.1 from an initial reading of 75.0 , but was down from last month 's 80.9 .
Economists thought it would hold steady , on average .
The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment last week fell by 11,000 , as expected .
U.S. light crude oil for January delivery fell 74 cents to settle at $ 97.29 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange , after having hit a record high of $ 99.23 in electronic overnight trading .
Oil prices were volatile after the release of the weekly oil inventories report , which showed a surprise drop in crude supplies .
COMEX gold for December delivery rose $ 7.20 to settle at $ 798.60 an ounce .
In currency trading , the dollar fell versus the yen and the euro .
BEIJING ( Reuters ) - A corrupt senior Chinese official was denounced by his 11 mistresses after some of their husbands were sentenced to death for graft , state media said on Friday .
The news comes just days after a senior provincial Communist Party official was executed for blowing up his mistress with a car bomb .
“ Second wives ” are common among government officials and businessmen in China and are often blamed for driving men to seek money through bribes or other abuses of power .
Pang Jiayu , 63 , former deputy head of the provincial political advisory body in the northwestern province of Shaanxi , was sacked and expelled from the Communist Party for graft , Xinhua news agency reported .
“ Pang did not expect that he would be brought down by his own 11 mistresses , ” the official People ’s Daily said in a report carried on its Web site .
Pang , who was also Party boss of Baoji city , had lured several women , mostly “ pretty and young ” wives of his subordinates , to be his mistresses , it said .
He helped them “ make big money ” by assigning them or their husbands huge government or other financial projects , it added .
In one water - diversion project in which Pang ’s wife and mistresses were involved , water pipes exploded and collapsed only half a year after completion , it said .
The mistresses decided to denounce Pang to the Party after some of their husbands were sentenced to death for graft in cases related to Pang .
The Party ’s discipline inspection commission said in July that they would deal with the case severely .
“ What awaits Pang Jiayu is severe punishment , ” the report said .
Chinese media said this week that 90 percent of the country ’s most senior officials punished for “ serious ” graft in the last five years had kept mistresses .
Duan
Yihe , former Party chief of Jinan city in the eastern province of Shandong , was executed Wednesday for blowing up his mistress after growing tired of her constant money demands .
Hong Kong newspaper reports said former finance minister Jin Renqing was sacked last month in part for a dalliance with a local socialite .
A government spokesman said he had resigned for “ personal reasons . ”
With a five - yearly Communist Party Congress due to open next month , and the fight against rampant corruption likely to loom large , official media these days are full of reports of venal officials meeting their comeuppance .
Top leaders have warned that the level of official corruption is so serious that it could threaten the Party ’s continuing rule .

Changing tactics
The Dover trial was the latest in a long line of court cases involving the teaching of evolution , but it was exceptional in that it was the first case that tested the legality of teaching Intelligent Design in a science class .
The decision at Dover determined that ID was unscientific and fundamentally religious .
Tonight , the PBS show NOVA will will take a look at the trial in a show that includes dramatized reenactments of courtroom scenes .
Not surprisingly , the organized ID movement has not been pleased with the Dover decision and has disparaged it at every opportunity ( they 're not fond of the NOVA special , either ) .
Regardless of their opinion , however , the court 's ruling was decisive , and no court cases regarding ID have made it to the trial stage since ;
Dover has become an effective threat to both hasten legal settlements and changes of policy .
That 's not to say that the Discovery Institute and other ID proponents have packed up and called it a day ; instead , they seem to simply be changing tactics .
Recent developments indicate that the next wave of anti-evolution agitation will take a two - pronged approach .
The first will be to try to foster doubt regarding evolution during high school education , while the second aims to explicitly carve a space for ID proponents at the college level by pressuring for their inclusion as a form of academic freedom .
We 'll take a brief look at both of these developments .
Public schools : a battle over books
The battle over evolution in the public school system may see Texas return to prominence as a battleground .
In July , Governor Rick Perry appointed creationist Don McLeroy chairman of the state school board .
Back in 2003 , he was one of a group of board members that voted against adoption of the system 's current textbooks because they did not emphasize the flaws in evolutionary theory .
While disavowing plans to introduce ID into the state curriculum , that group claims that , once again , " they 'll push for books to include a more thorough examination of weaknesses in the theory of evolution . "
This push for teaching weaknesses comes at the same time that the Discovery Institute , the pro-ID think tank , has decided to take precisely that approach .
They 've produced a textbook , Explore Evolution , that 's specifically designed to emphasize supposed weaknesses in evolutionary theory .
Targeted at high school level biology classes , the book purports to use an " inquiry - based approach " to introduce students to evolutionary biology .
Based on its promotional material , however , it appears to simply raise the same flawed arguments that have been used against evolution for years , primarily those from Discovery fellows Michael Behe and Jonathan Wells .
There is clearly controversy within evolutionary studies — I 've covered a number of them at Nobel Intent in the past — but these have nothing to do with the supposed issues brought up in this text , such as whether natural selection is important and the supposed existence of " molecular machines . "
Neither of these topics are the least bit controversial within the scientific community , and the book 's promotional material can only be described as stretching the truth past its breaking point when it claims , " Explore Evolution brings to the classroom data and debates that already are raised regularly by scientists in their science journals . "
Is the appearance of both this text and a new push to introduce facetious criticisms of evolution merely coincidental ?
I 'd suspect myself of paranoia if it were n't for a sermon delivered by the person who 's now heading the Texas School Board .
Reading through the text , you 'll find McLeroy making repeated references to major players in the ID movement , and a discussion of its " big tent " strategy for undermining science .
Given the overlap , it 's hard to imagine that there 's not been some long - term planning involved .
Mother ’s formula feed for a variety of reasons , I ’m not going to debate the issue of breast v formula .
I bf both my children until I returned to work because it was right for me and when I returned to work , they had formula while in care and I bf at home .
I chose the formula I chose for a variety of reasons ; it was recommended by other mothers , it was a good quality formula and had an established reputation .
Now my children are far beyond the need for formula but I was incensed this afternoon to read about Karicare Gold using a prohibited , non approved additive in its formula .
The company Nutricia New Zealand insists that the additive inulin has been used in Europe for seven years with no safety concerns ; fructo - oligosaccharide is approved for use in the European Union , however the NZ Food Safety Authority says that while it does n’t know that the product is unsafe , tests have not been carried out to prove it is safe under NZ conditions .
To me it ’s a moot point as to whether the supplement is ultimately decided to be safe or not .
Nutricia made the choice to sell a formula to consumers that trust them , knowing it contained ingredients that had yet to be passed as safe .
Parents do trust that all the ingredients in a baby formula are tested and proved safe for their babies .
Nutricia have made a huge error in circumventing the food safety authority .
I know as a mother I would never , ever trust their formula again , simply because they did not follow rules , established to ensure the safety of my children .
Who does this company think they are , to make decisions about the safety of my children or anyone elses ?
It ’s not their children they are putting at risk , it ’s our children , the unknowing consumer ’s , how are they to know about the possible side affects if they are unaware this product is in the formula ?
A clear message needs to be sent by parents .
We will not allow companies to essentially experiment on our children !
This is too important to ignore .
Updated : 1644
This is from the Nutricia website detailing the way they stick to the regulatory environment stringently , bit of a joke now really and the Australian Authority is looking at Nutricia Karicare Gold as well .

A principal reason for the decline by half of network evening news ratings is the public ’s short attention span .
That ’s what former NBC Nightly News anchor Tom Brokaw told CNN ’s Howard Kurtz on his “ Reliable News ” program Sunday while discussing the low ratings endured by the CBS Evening News under anchor Katie Couric .
Said Mr. Brokaw :
Also , the CBS News division had taken some hits .
They were n’t as strong as they had been earlier .
So I think it was a combination of all of those things .
One of the penalties that she pays or anyone pays in this business anymore is that the attention span of the country is so short on all of these matters .
[ emphasis added ]
Mr. Brokaw , perhaps the best anchor of the post - Cronkite generation , may be both right and wrong .
Whether the brevity of the stories produced the short attention span or the short attention span produced the brevity is the sort of chicken - and - egg question philosophers and lawyers love .
But rarely do those involved in network news admit to their roles in creating a public less capable of sustained , serious thought .
Mr. Brokaw is a thoughtful man , and he should understand this .
The newscasts ’ ratings have fallen from roughly a 15 share to a 6 or 7 share in the past 25 years , according to a Project for Excellence in Journalism study .
The average evening news viewer is 60 years old ( meaning it ’s me ) , well outside the target demographic of 18 - to 49 - year - olds the advertisers crave .
The audience of the evening news is literally dying , and the younger folks are n’t tuning in â€ ” because it was never their habit to do so .
But the lengths of stories on the nightly news do not lend themselves to full , articulate reporting .
So why should anyone tune in ?
Is it just what they ’re used to getting ?
( I know , I know :
We can argue about the meaning of “ full ” and “ articulate ” another time . )
The stories are not necessarily “ dumbed down , ” but they are short stories .
They can not be fully fleshed representations of reality .
Nearly half â€ ” 42 percent â€ ” of network evening news stories are 40 seconds or less .
And 48 percent are between 90 seconds and 120 seconds long , according to a Project for Excellence in Journalism study .
So the stories do not require a long attention span by the viewers .
The short duration of the stories feeds the perception of short attention span .
So what came first ?
The short story or the inattentive viewer ?
The content of the stories , and their quality , may also reflect that perception of the short attention span .
That study by the Project for Excellence in Journalism â€ ” “ The State of the News Media 2004 ” â€ ” also assessed the content of the nightly network newscasts :
Looked at another way , if you watched a commercial nightly newscast every weeknight for a month â€ ” some 10 hours of programming â€ ” you would have seen : â€¢ Less than a minute about culture and the arts
â€¢ Less than a minute on family and parenting
â€ ¢ About four minutes on the environment
â€ ¢ Less than five minutes about transportation
â€¢ Slightly less than seven minutes about education
â€¢ About 14 minutes on healthcare
â€¢ About 16 minutes of crime
â€¢ About 22 minutes on accidents and disasters
â€¢ About 74 minutes on government matters
â€¢ About 97 minutes on foreign affairs
How does this news agenda compare to Page A - 1 of America ’s newspapers ?
That study is nearly 4 years old , of course .
Today , these times would probably reflect the recent emphases on climate change , the war on terror , the 2008 presidential horse race and the discovery that stories about missing or murdered beautiful white women make for excellent ratings .
But would the content shift sufficiently to suggest viewers are truly receiving news ?
Or is it still , as Doc Slammy once said of CNN , “ News Whizâ „ ¢ ” ?
Local news is n’t an improvement , according to the PEJ study :
Yet the data also reveal that the medium is dominated by the ethos of “ live , local and late - breaking ” coverage , particularly of crime .
Many of the stories are formulaic , reactive and , above all , short .
Here are some findings :
â€ ¢ Three - quarters of all stories are local .
â€¢ Roughly 70 percent of the stories are under one minute long .
â€ ¢
The most common topic is crime â€ ” by more than 2 to 1 over anything else .
â€ ¢
Four in ten stories are about fairly typical , everyday incidents .
â€ ¢
Six out of ten stories that involved controversy gave only or mostly one point of view .
Formulaic , reactive , and above all , short .
That would make a remarkable epitaph for TV news , either network or local , were it not for the enormous profits each makes .
It does n’t take a genius to see that formulaic , reactive and short stories cost far less to report and produce than innovative , analytical and complete stories .
To partially blame falling ratings on the public ’s short attention span â€ ” without acknowledging the network news programs ’ complicity in either creating or fostering it â€ ” is a sad blemish on Mr. Brokaw ’s otherwise uncommonly thoughtful Sunday appearance on CNN .
Soul singer Akon was one of the stars at MTV Arabia 's Dubai launch
Saudi hip hop artist
MTV says it hopes to respect local culture without diluting its brand .
The MTV Arabia service will screen Arab music videos , talent shows , and international programmes like Pimp My Ride adapted for Arab audiences .
It says it hopes the channel can act as a cultural unifying force in a region known for political tension .
Stiff competition
With around two thirds of the Arab world 's population under 30 years of age , MTV Arabia launches into a competitive market , up against more than 50 other Arab music channels .
The station aims to address local issues and tap into local talent .
At the launch of the channel in Dubai , singers said they hoped it would help Middle Eastern artists gain recognition .
" I think it 's going to help the exposure , for all the music in the Middle East , " said soul star Akon .
Abdul Latif al - Sayegh , the head of MTV's partner in the venture , Arab Media Group , said he hoped the channel might help persuade Arabs living in Western countries to return home .
The service says on its website that since its launch in 1981 , MTV has " influenced how young people all over the world dress , think , and talk . "
It also claims the channel has " given artists a forum for airing their political views and pushed society 's boundaries . "
It Starts With the Console ...
The Nintendo Entertainment System has influenced our lives more than we could ever imagine .
First launching in Japan in 1983 and then coming state - side in 1985 , gamers relished the hightech game play over past consoles like the Commodore 64 , Atari , or Atari 2600 .
Little did we realize that the NES would be so influential as to one day be a part of our adult lives .
So much so as to have our wedding cakes , themes , party favors , ice sculptures , etc modeled after this gaming innovation and the personalities of the games that accompanied it .

Within the patent attorney / patent trolling world , there 's been a story gathering steam over the last couple months that seems to only get more bizarre every week .
It started , simply enough , at the beginning of September when a company , which was just formed a few months ago , called Illinois Computer Research , sued Google for patent infringement .
The patent in question ( which amusingly enough , can be found hosted at Google ) is officially for " Enhancing touch and feel on the internet " .
The details show that it 's really just describing how you might represent a book online -- and , in fact , the lawsuit points to Google 's book scanning project as being infringing .
There 's nothing all that interesting there , other than yet another case of a company doing nothing suing a company that 's doing quite a bit of innovating using an overly broad an obvious patent .
However , at the end of the article linked above there 's a small aside that has turned out to be much more important : " The inventor listed on the patent is Scott C. Harris of San Diego , Calif .
Presumably , he is the same Scott C. Harris listed as a Principal in the San Diego office of Fish & Richardson P.C , a patent prosecution firm . "
From that , you would probably assume that Fish and Richardson was behind ICR 's lawsuit .
In fact , you 'd be wrong .
Google is actually a Fish & Richardson client ... whereas ICR is represented by Niro , Scavone , a firm that has fought against Fish & Richardson quite a bit .
Then the details started to come out .
It appears that a top partner at Fish & Richardson was filing for patents on the side and then licensing them out to patent trolls , often so that they would then sue companies -- including companies represented by his own employer , Fish & Richardson .
Now , I know I said that I 'm not a fan of the term " patent troll , " but in this case it appears completely warranted , as the very same Scott Harris happens to run a website ( currently taken down ) called ImAPatentTroll.com .
If he 's okay with it , then I see no reason not to use it to describe him .
Fish & Richardson fired Harris , but the story does n't end there .
Illinois Computer Research is n't just suing Google ... it 's also suing Fish & Richardson for supposedly trying to get Harris to get it to drop the suit .
Now , Fish & Richardson has filed quite a response , claiming that Harris used company time , equipment and resources to file for a bunch of patents -- and then , rather than just licensing or selling those patents , would work out special deals with the companies he licensed the patents to , allowing him ( personally ) to get a cut of any legal wins those firms get in suing for infringement .
He even would point out firms that might be infringing on the patent .
Many of the negotiations for those relationships were done using his Fish & Richardson email -- even one email discussion that pointed out that Google ( again , an F&R client who Harris had even done some work for ) was potentially infringing on Harris ' patent and could be a good target for a lawsuit .
Welcome to the lovely world of patent extortion , where the money from the practice is so lucrative that one of the highest paid lawyers at a top law firm would quietly license his patents to be used against his own firm 's clients in exchange for a cut of the profits .

Venezuelan early risers will now get more daylight
President Hugo Chavez says that an earlier dawn means the performance of the country will improve , as more people will wake up in daylight .
" I do n't care if they call me crazy , the new time will go ahead , " he said .
But critics say the move is unnecessary and the president simply wants to be in a different time zone from his arch-rival , the United States .
The new time puts Venezuela four - and - a- half hours behind Greenwich Mean Time , and out of step with all its neighbours .
The move had first been announced in August , but it has been delayed twice because international bodies and Venezuela itself were not ready to implement the change .
Science and Technology Minister Hector Nacarro praised the measure .
" I see it as a very positive thing that while there is light we can be in it , " he said .
And President Chavez said earlier this year that schoolchildren would arrive for lessons with more energy as a result of the change .
" These children have to get up at five in the morning ... they arrive at school dead tired .
And why ?
Because of our time . "
Odd minutes
The time change is the latest in a series of reforms implemented by President Chavez , who has already changed the country 's name , coat of arms and flag .
You can slice Greenwich Mean Time any number of ways
Small time differences are hardly unique , however .
Canada 's Newfoundland province is half - an - hour out of step with other Atlantic provinces .
Pakistan is only half - an - hour behind India , while Nepal is a mere 15 minutes ahead of its large southern neighbour .
Western Australia and South Australia observe a 90 - minute time difference across the state boundary .
However , the remote border town of Eucla and the surrounding area , home to a few hundred people , operates on its own time zone , 45 minutes ahead of Western Australia and 45 minutes behind South Australia .
Update :
Forcing his Republican colleagues to put up or shut up on the notion of an up - or - down vote , Senate Majority leader Harry Reid ( D - NV ) just moments ago announced that he will immediately file a cloture motion on the Reed - Levin troop redeployment bill and , if Republicans follow through with a filibuster , will place the Senate in a prolonged all - night session Tuesday to force a true continuation of debate .
" Now , Republicans are using a filibuster to block us from even voting on an amendment that could bring the war to a responsible end , " said Reid .
" They are protecting the President rather than protecting our troops .
They are denying us an up or down – yes or no – vote on the most important issue our country faces .
" The Reed - Levin amendment to the Department of Defense ( DoD ) Authorization Bill requires George W. Bush to " commence the reduction of the number of United States forces in Iraq not later than 120 days after the date of the enactment of this Act " and mandates a withdrawal of most combat forces by April 30 , 2008 .
The legislation , , has bipartisan support and is cosponsored by Gordon Smith ( R - OR ) , Chuck Hagel ( R-NE ) and Olympia Snowe ( R - ME ) .
In making this move ( based on my understanding of Senate rules ) , Reid is invoking the provisions of Rule 22 ( Precedence of Motions ) of the Standing Rules of the Senate , which provides , at the Majority Leader 's discretion , up to 30 hours of debate if a filibuster is initiated -- as the Republicans will most certainly do , knowing that Reed - Levin may very well have the 51 votes needed for passage .
Sixty votes are needed to achieve cloture ( end debate ) and move legislation to a full , deciding vote .
Reid will be using the provision of Rule 22 that allows for up to 30 hours of continuous debate once it's made clear -- in this case , by Republicans trying to avoid an up - or - down vote on Reed - Levin -- that there is a desire to continue debating the issue .
In other words , the Majority Leader is saying " You want to debate ?
We 'll stay all night and debate . "
" I would like to inform the Republican leadership and all my colleagues that we have no intention of backing down , " said Reid this afternoon .
" If Republicans do not allow a vote on Levin / Reed today or tomorrow , we will work straight through the night on Tuesday .
The American people deserve an open and honest debate on this war , and they deserve an up or down vote on this amendment to end it .
" Reid could hold the Senate in continuous session overnight Tuesday and into midday Wednesday unless Republicans agree to a simple - majority vote on Reed - Levin .
Senate Democrats will then be prepared to take to the floor and speak all night and , if their Republican colleagues do not remain in the chamber , invoke ongoing quorum calls and other procedural maneuvers to force GOP members back to the Senate floor .
With the whole specter of cots being dragged into Senate cloakrooms and the pure theatrics involved , I 'm hopeful this will shine a white - hot spotlight on the Senate 's Republican leadership and show Americans how the GOP does n't truly support helping troops and their families at home or extricating them from pointless involvement in the Iraqi civil war .
And I 'm sure more than one Democratic Senator will remind the public that Republicans screamed at the top of their lungs last year when it came to getting up - or - down votes on Bush 's right - wing judicial nominees , but expressing the sentiments of most Americans and protecting America 's troops gets no such treatment from them .
Said Reid today : " We do n't have to mark time , waiting for the President to wake up one morning with a revelation .
And we can choose that new path right now . "
Here 's the text of the Reed - Levin legislation .
Defense minister Jaak Aaviksoo got help from NATO in the wake of the cyberattacks . *
Photo : Donald Milne * __The minister __of defense checked the Web page again — still nothing .
He stared at the error message :
For some reason , the site for Estonia 's leading newspaper , the Postimees , was n't responding .
Jaak Aaviksoo attempted to pull up the sites of a couple of other papers .
They were all down .
The former director of the University of Tartu Institute of Experimental Physics and Technology had been the Estonian defense minister for only four weeks .
He had n't even changed the art on the walls .
An aide rushed in with a report .
It was n't just the newspapers .
The leading bank was under siege .
Government communications were going down .
An enemy had invaded and was assaulting dozens of targets .
Outside , everything was quiet .
The border guards had reported no incursions , and Estonian airspace had not been violated .
The aide explained what was going on :
They were under attack by a rogue computer network .
It is known as a botnet , and it had slipped into the country through its least protected border — the Internet .
Ministers of defense develop strategies to combat the threat of missile attacks , naval bombardment , air raids , and tank advances .
But a digital invasion ?
Estonia is a member of both NATO and the European Union .
Should Aaviksoo invoke NATO
Article 5 , which states that an assault on one allied country obligates the alliance to attack the aggressor ?
In the coming months , commentators around the world would look back at this moment and debate its significance .
But for Aaviksoo , the meaning was clear .
This was not the first botnet strike ever , nor was it the largest .
But never before had an entire country been targeted on almost every digital front all at once , and never before had a government itself fought back .
" The attacks were aimed at the essential electronic infrastructure of the Republic of Estonia , " Aaviksoo tells me later .
" All major commercial banks , telcos , media outlets , and name servers — the phone books of the Internet — felt the impact , and this affected the majority of the Estonian population .
This was the first time that a botnet threatened the national security of an entire nation . "
Welcome to Web War one .
The event thatsparked this digital onslaught had occurred a few days earlier .
Around dawn on April 27 — after an overnight meeting of the nation 's crisis commission — the Estonian government removed a 6 - foot - tall bronze statue in downtown Tallinn , the capital of Estonia .
The Soviets had built the monument in 1947 to commemorate their war dead after driving the Nazis out of the region at the end of World War II .
But having rid the country of German occupation , the Russians decided to settle in .
The Soviet secret police set up shop , and soon masses of Estonians were deported to Siberia .
To many citizens , the statue was a symbol of an oppressive occupation .
Now , after 16 years of independence , the Estonians had finally mustered the gumption to ignore the protests of the Russian government — which had warned ominously that the removal would be " disastrous for Estonians " — and uprooted the statue .
Three days later , it was installed in a military cemetery in the suburbs .
Even before the removal , violence broke out in the streets of Tallinn .
Rioters smashed shop windows , flipped over cars , and threw rocks at riot police .
Most of the demonstrators were ethnic Russians , who make up a quarter of the nation 's population .
But the fighting died down quickly ; hundreds of people were arrested , the windows were repaired , and street sweepers had cleaned up everything by the morning of April 28 .
But just as the unrest subsided , a different kind of aggression began to sweep the country .
The head of IT at the Postimees watched it with alarm .
Ago Väärsi had dealt with spikes in the newspaper 's Internet traffic before , but this was different .
From his office at the top of one of Tallinn 's highest buildings , the 31 - year - old had spent the past few years serving up a million pageviews a day , roughly comparable to the traffic at the Seattle Post - Intelligencer .
But now his paper 's servers were being swamped with 2.3 million pageviews and had already crashed 20 times .
A flat - panel monitor on the wall of his office displayed bandwidth consumption — the amount of traffic flowing to the newspaper from within Estonia and from around the world .
Usually it hovered in the green zone — 20 to 30 percent of capacity unused .
Now he watched as the numbers ticked down : 20 percent unused , 10 percent unused , 5 percent unused .
If it reached zero , the site would become inaccessible .
Väärsi has the look of a ' 70s rock promoter — he wears his hair long and his shirts open , and he sports rose - tinted , square sunglasses .
He 's proof that the geeks have triumphed in this country of 1.3 million .
Some 40 percent read a newspaper online daily , more than 90 percent of bank transactions are done over the Internet , and the government has embraced online voting .
The country is saturated in free Wi -Fi , cell phones can be used to pay for parking or buy lunch , and Skype is taking over the international phone business from its headquarters on the outskirts of Tallinn .
In other words , Estonia — or eStonia , as some citizens prefer — is like a window into the future .
Someday , the rest of the world will be as wired as this tiny Baltic nation .
If so , the future was looking perilous .
Väärsi watched as automated computer programs continued to spew posts onto the commentary pages of the Postimees Web site , creating a two - fold problem :
The spam overloaded the server 's processors and hogged bandwidth .
Väärsi turned off the comments feature .
That saved bandwidth — the meter showed that there was still capacity — but what did get through tied the machines into knots and crashed them repeatedly .
He discovered that the attackers were constantly tweaking their malicious server requests to evade the filters .
Whoever was behind this was sophisticated , fast , and intelligent .
As the sun lit the Baltic Sea outside Väärsi 's window , he realized he was exhausted .
He had been in the office writing filters and struggling to keep his servers up for days .
Every time a server crashed , he received an automated alert on his cell phone : " Web site is critical . "
The paper 's editors thought he was going to have a heart attack .
The attacks , among other things , crippled ATMs in Tallinn .
At the time , Väärsi could n't have known that this was just the beginning .
On the morning of Wednesday , May 2 , traffic again rose precipitously , driven largely by overseas visitors .
So far , Väärsi had preserved enough bandwidth to keep the Postimees online by removing ads and pictures .
The pages were a lighter load , but the capacity monitor was still hovering precariously close to zero .
Väärsi initially thought the traffic spike was due simply to international interest in the statue controversy .
But then he looked at where the traffic was coming from .
The number one foreign country accessing the site : Egypt. Vietnam and Peru followed .
He doubted that a sizable Estonian population had suddenly materialized in southeast Asia and South America .
Väärsi had already asked Elion , the paper 's Internet service provider , to increase bandwidth capacity .
Now he had 110 Mbps , the maximum available .
It made no difference .
At noon , available bandwidth hit zero .
The site went down .
Väärsi tried to pull up his competitors '
Web sites .
They were down as well .
He knew he had only one choice : to sever the international connection .
He keyed in a few lines of code and pressed Enter — and all international requests to the paper were suddenly blocked .
In the eyes of the world , the Postimees Web site disappeared .
Instantaneously , the bandwidth meter turned green .
The site became accessible again within Estonia , but at a cost .
Estonia 's leading news outlet could not tell the world what was going on in its own country .
Though this was a 21st - century attack , Väärsi used the same defense Estonia had used against Russian invasions four centuries earlier :
He had closed the gates , pulled up the ramparts , and settled in for a siege .
__Four days __after the siege began , Hillar Aarelaid was having dinner at , a high - end restaurant just outside the walls of the old city of Tallinn .
He does n't look like the fine - dining type .
His years working the streets as a beat cop have stuck with him :
His face seems frozen into an expression that says " Do n't mess with me . "
But he was here for a reason .
Since his rookie years in the 1980s , he has moved up the ranks , and 10 years ago he began specializing in digital crime .
Now he 's head of the Estonian computer emergency response team .
Known by the acronym CERT , Aarelaid 's IT cops are the de facto Estonian Internet defense force , charged with coordinating the country 's response to the attacks .
The problem was that IT managers nationwide , like Väärsi , had so far been able to use only the bluntest tool — they cut off Estonia from the rest of the world .
Fighting the bots directly required a more modern defense .
It required social networking .
Across the dinner table from Aarelaid sat Kurtis Lindqvist , the man in charge of running Stockholm - based Netnod , one of the world 's 13 root DNS servers , which direct global Internet traffic .
That makes Lindqvist a sort of Olympian in the IT crowd .
He is a handsome 32 - year - old with a dimpled chin and close - cropped hair .
By day , he wears a trench coat and shades , but the geek in him is just below the surface .
He loves to play badminton and often programs late into the night .
And , befitting the trench - coat - and - shades look , he belongs to a clandestine alliance of Internet elite with the power to cut off global Internet flows .
He 's one of the so - called Vetted : the select few who are trusted by the world 's largest ISPs and can ask them to kick rogue computers off the network .
The Vetted constantly crisscross the globe to expand their network of trusted members , and by a stroke of luck , Lindqvist and some others were in Tallinn that week for what was referred to as a BOF — a birds - of - a- feather — meeting with European network operators .
A mutual friend suggested that Lindqvist sit down with Aarelaid .
The cybercop explained what had happened : Web sites around Estonia had resorted to a siege defense by cutting off international traffic .
To beat back the bots , he needed help tracing their origins .
Then he needed to persuade ISPs around the world to blacklist the individual attacking computers that would otherwise overwhelm Estonia 's bandwidth .
The problem was that most international ISPs had never heard of Hillar Aarelaid .
For all they knew , he could be a hacker trying to cut off legitimate users .
That 's where the Vetted would come in — they could make the calls on Aarelaid 's behalf .
By the end of dinner , Lindqvist was satisfied that Aarelaid was legit , and he agreed to join him at CERT headquarters whenever Aarelaid wanted .
Patrik Fältström from Sweden and Bill Woodcock from the US — two more of the Vetted — would also go .
Aarelaid had his social network .
__The cyberattacks __on Estonia , like most other ambitious campaigns , unfolded across multiple fronts .
The foot soldiers were called script kiddies — relatively unsophisticated troublemakers who copied programs line for line off hacker Web sites .
Their primary weapon was the ping attack , a simple request for a response from a Web server , repeated hundreds of times per second .
When deployed by masses of attackers , the pings could overwhelm a server .
The script kiddies were stoked into a fervor on Russian - language chat rooms .
First they were goaded by overheated rhetoric about the April 27 removal of the statue .
A week later , hundreds of posts called for a coordinated attack at the stroke of midnight on May 9 , the day Russia celebrates its World War II victory .
" You do not agree with the policy of eSStonia ? ? ? " demanded a user named Victoris on a Russian online forum .
" You may think you have no influence on the situation ???
You CAN have it on the Internet ! "
The post then laid out precise instructions on how to launch a ping attack on specific Estonian sites .
It was the equivalent in the real world of an army recruitment pitch bundled with marching orders .
Then there was the air force : botnets .
These giant squadrons were made up of hundreds of thousands of individual computers from around the world that had been hijacked previously by hackers .
The computers , known as zombies , could be made to repeatedly flood designated Internet addresses with a variety of useless network - clogging data .
It was the digital version of carpet bombing and is referred to as a distributed denial of service , or DDoS , attack .
Finally , there were the special forces — hackers who could infiltrate individual Web sites , delete legitimate content , and post their own messages .
They used private chat rooms to communicate among themselves , but in public forums they hinted at their intentions .
" DDoS is occurring even now but something more potent is on its way . :) , " wrote a hacker named S1B .
" On the 9th of May a mass attack is planned .
The action will be massive — it 's planned to take Estonnet the fuck down :) . "
The cyberattacks were sparked when Estonian officials decided to move a statue commemorating Russian war dead to the Tallinn suburbs .
At 10 pm on Tuesday , May 8 , Lindqvist , Fältström , and Woodcock arrived at the downtown Tallinn office building that housed CERT headquarters .
It was a geek dream team , with the attitude to match .
Woodcock , who had spent years traveling through Europe , Africa , and Asia helping to set up Internet infrastructures , sauntered into the operations center wearing bison - skin boots handcrafted for him in Montana .
Fältström , a pony - tailed former programmer for the Swedish Navy , now advised his government on Internet security .
Lindqvist grabbed an Oreo off the counter , flipped open his PowerBook G4 , and plugged in .
Aarelaid would lead the charge — his team had to identify the addresses of the attackers and build the filters that would get distributed worldwide — but these guys were the ones with real battle experience .
Woodcock hoisted his laptop into the air .
He called Aarelaid and Lindqvist over , took a picture with the built - in camera , and sent it out to the network to prove to the Vetted that Aarelaid was for real .
Lindqvist grinned broadly .
Aarelaid stared calmly at the camera .
It was almost 11 pm in Tallinn — midnight Moscow time .
Everything looked normal on the networks .
Traffic coming into Estonia was average for this time of night — about 20,000 packets per second .
The first wave of attacks had died down over the previous two days .
Maybe the online chatter about an attack that night was a hoax — maybe nothing would happen .
At exactly 11 pm , Estonia was slammed with traffic coming in at more than 4 million packets per second , a 200 - fold surge .
Globally , nearly 1 million computers suddenly navigated to a multitude of Estonian sites , ranging from the foreign ministry to the major banks .
It was a larger - scale version of what had happened to the Postimees , except that the entire country 's bandwidth capacity was being squeezed .
Immediately , Aarelaid and his team started chasing the sources upstream .
What they found was a botnet comprising mostly hijacked computers in the US .
As Aarelaid identified a specific address , Woodcock and Lindqvist sent rapid - fire emails to network operators throughout the world asking for the IP to be blocked at the source .
Their goal was to block traffic before it could enter Estonia 's major international connections .
One by one , they picked off the bots , and by dawn they had deflected the attackers .
Internet traffic into the country hovered just above normal .
" I was very , very lucky that Kurtis , Patrik , and Bill were here , " Aarelaid says .
As the sun rose in Moscow that morning , Red Square was cordoned off .
Soon , fighter jets streaked through the cloudy skies while 7,000 Russian soldiers marched past President Putin to celebrate Russia 's victory over Nazi Germany .
" Those who are trying today to ... desecrate memorials to war heroes are insulting their own people , sowing discord and new distrust between states and people , " Putin proclaimed to the troops .
This veiled threat came as yet another 58 separate botnet attacks rained down on Estonia over the course of the day .
Aarelaid continued his blocking efforts even as the Russian government denied involvement in the offensive .
True , some of the attacking computers were located in Russia , including , Estonian officials say , one in Putin 's presidential administration office , the equivalent of the West Wing .
But those computers were most likely hijacked in the same way US machines had been taken over — when their users opened an infected attachment or visited a site that automatically installed malware .
The appearance of Russian IP addresses nevertheless incensed the Estonians .
From the beginning , Urmas Paet , Estonia 's foreign minister , had been accusing Putin 's administration of direct involvement .
" The European Union is under attack , because Russia is attacking Estonia , " he had said in a statement a week earlier .
" The attacks are virtual , psychological , and real . "
It was n't the first time the Russian government had been accused of being involved in a large botnet campaign .
In fact , just a few weeks earlier , a similar assault had been launched against an alliance of Russian opposition parties led by chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov .
The attacks shut down the opposition Web sites just as government authorities announced a change in venue for an upcoming opposition rally .
With his Web site down , Kasparov had difficulty informing his followers of the change , and when they massed at the originally announced location , he was arrested for leading an illegal rally .
Part of the botnet that attacked the opposition Web sites was soon redeployed to assault Estonia .
( At wired 's request , Arbor Networks , a security firm that tracks international DDoS attacks , was able to identify overlap between the networks involved in both attacks . )
Denis Bilunov , the executive director of the United Civil Front , Kasparov 's party , was n't surprised .
" There is a specific department within the FSB — the successor to the KGB — that specializes in coordinating Internet campaigns against those they consider a threat , " he says .
" They have attacked Chechen rebel sites , us , and now it appears they have attacked Estonia . "
__ In mid-May , __the major botnet attacksstopped as suddenly as they started .
The bots appeared to have been set to run for exactly two weeks .
After that , the infected com puters abandoned the attacks and reverted to more traditional botnet pastimes , like spamming and extortion .
There was plenty of evidence suggesting a clear Russian agenda in the attacks : Russian - language bulletin boards exhorted readers to defend the motherland , and on at least one Estonian site , attackers replaced the homepage with the phrase " Hacked from Russian hackers . "
But the Russian government showed little interest in tracking down the culprits .
So in late June I head to Moscow to find out what I can .
I make an appointment to meet the vice directors of the Institute of Information Security Issues at Lomonosov Moscow State University .
Alexey Salnikov and Valery Yashenko have recently hosted an international conference focusing in part on Internet security .
Its first roundtable : counteracting cyberterrorism .
We sit down beneath a photo of Putin in Yashenko's large office .
Yashenko explains that the institute represents the Russian government on all scientific Internet issues and advises the Kremlin on matters of cyberterrorism .
I ask him what he knows about the cyberattacks against Estonia .
" I did n't have any interest in it , nor do I have the slightest intention of studying it , " he says .
" It is an unimportant example . "
He goes on to explain that no country can protect itself from cyberattacks on its own .
There needs to be broader international cooperation .
I ask if he has offered this support to Estonia .
He responds that he was too busy with other projects .
I contact Hacker , a small Russian - language publication that claims to represent the hacker community , and ask to meet with its editor .
He agrees , but when I show up at the restaurant on Bolshaya Lubyanka Street , I find instead a skinny , anxious 21 - year - old named Emin Azizov .
He is n't with the magazine but says the editor has sent him to see me and explain exactly what happened to Estonia .
We walk to a nearby park and sit on a bench .
Azizov begins by saying that he has closely followed the attacks against Estonia .
He watched the hackers formulate their plans in public and private chat sessions and emphasizes that it was not coordinated by the government .
These were simply hackers whose fathers and grandfathers had made huge sacrifices for Russia during World War II .
The botnets involved — which are usually rented for criminal purposes — were in this case dispatched for free .
It was not about money .
It was about Russian pride .
If that is the case — if Azizov is n't trying to cloud the issue — the implication is perhaps more troubling .
It suggests that there is a group of Russian hackers who , on their own , can disrupt the routine functioning of commerce , media , and government any time they want .
If so , these hackers represent a stateless power — a sort of private militia .
Azizov insists that he did not participate in the Estonian assault .
Then he tells me that 80 percent of Estonian Web sites are vulnerable to attack and offers to show me how .
We move to a coffee shop so Azizov can plug in his Alienware laptop .
It connects to the Internet via cellular card , and he navigates to R2.ee , an Estonian radio station .
After a few keystrokes , he smiles and tilts the screen toward me .
There is an error message .
He has performed what is known as an SQL injection attack .
With one more keystroke , he says , he could take over the site entirely .
" Why are you showing me this ? " I ask .
He tells me that he has just started a new company that will help system administrators assess the vulnerability of their sites .
He will identify weaknesses , as he just has with R2.ee , and offer to fix them — for a price .
" Did you offer to help fix R2.ee ? " I ask .
He smiles awkwardly and says that he has n't .
I ask him why anyone would trust him .
After all , he seems to have a suspiciously intimate knowledge of the Estonian attacks .
" Russian IT specialists are knowledgeable and experienced enough to destroy the key servers of whole states , " he says .
" They 're the best in the world . "
The implication : Clearly you want them on your side , so why not hire them ?
Maybe Estonia was simply an advertising campaign .
__Ene Ergma is __a formidable woman — tough and smart .
At 63 , the speaker of the Estonian parliament looks like she'd be as comfortable driving a tank as playing with the grandkids .
She has a PhD from Russia 's Institute of Space Research , where she wrote a dissertation titled " Unstable Thermonuclear Burning at Late Stages of Stellar Evolution . "
Today , she leans toward me in her gilded office in the parliament building and says that she suspects the attacks were a test .
" Estonia is a NATO country , " she says .
" Attacking us is one way of checking NATO 's defenses .
They could examine the alliance 's readiness under the cover of the statue protest . "
An alliance , however , could not use the siege defense that Estonia initially employed — the NATO countries can't all cut themselves off from the world .
And they'd have a hard time fighting back :
Since governments do n't control the Internet , they can't effectively fight such a war on their own .
They can't raise an Internet army from scratch , because the key element in defending against botnets is a network of trust .
The international community would have to rely on the already established community of the Vetted .
In this new world of Internet warfare , armies will be replaced by badminton - loving geeks .
Ergma understands this .
She spent years studying nuclear energy and watched the world transform as it wrapped itself around the advent of nuclear technology .
For her , information warfare is a similar defining moment in world history .
" When I look at a nuclear explosion and the explosion that happened in our country in May , I see the same thing , " she says .
" Like nuclear radiation , cyberwar does n't make you bleed , but it can destroy everything . "

Feature When Bots Attack Washington Ignores Cyberattack Threats , Putting Us all at Peril
Deep pessimism alongside cautious optimism - those are the two key principles that emerge from this year 's Annual Israeli Intelligence Estimate .
The report will be presented to the security cabinet in several days time by IDF Intelligence Chief Major - General Amos Yadlin , but the highlights are here for you now in a Ynet exclusive report .
Challenging NIE
Israeli delegation dispatched to US to argue that Iran still pursuing bomb Associated Press Intelligence experts at end of week - long mission to Washington to counter findings of NIE report claiming Iran no longer developing nuclear weapons Israeli delegation dispatched to US to argue that Iran still pursuing bomb
The aforementioned pessimism concerns Iran 's nuclear ambitions .
The American National Intelligence Estimate " dropped quite a bomb " on Israel 's struggle against Iran 's nuclear program , said officials within Israel 's defense establishment .
The US report only diminishes the likelihood that the international community will impose harsh , effective sanctions on Iran and also that the US itself will strike Iranian nuclear facilities .
" It is clear to us now that no one will do the work for us , " one of the report 's authors told Ynet , Israel can now rely solely on its own military capabilities , if and when the Iranian nuclear program achieves its aims .
The differences of opinion among the Israeli and American intelligence communities stem from different methodologies for analyzing raw data .
Washington and Jerusalem are in almost total agreement regarding the known facts , as the two supply each other with whatever information they posses .
The difference therefore lies in the interpretation of that data : Israeli intelligence does not know for certain that Iran renewed its attempt to develop a weapon , i.e. the bomb itself , after it froze the program in 2003 .
But sources are saying that if Iran restarted its efforts in the winter of 2005 / 2006 to convert uranium into gas ( for enrichment purposes ) as well as its uranium enrichment purposes – then it is reasonable to assume that the weapons development program was also reactivated .
The fact that we do not know for certain that this was done , say sources within the defense establishment , indicates only that we do not know enough – and that Iran 's attempts at concealment are effective ; we must , therefore , work harder .
On the contrary , the American intelligence community , after learning a bitter lesson from its experience with Iraq , is taking a stance marked by meticulousness and caution : we posses information that the Iranians did not renew attempts to develop a bomb , therefore – given the absence of solid material proving the opposite – we believe what the information we have .
The only ray of light Israeli intelligence has to offer on this issue is information that Tehran has thus far encountered multiple technical difficulties in the process of obtaining fissile weapons - grade uranium through enrichment .
The time for difficult decisions will arrive , however , when Iran crosses the " technological threshold " in the enrichment process – an event which may soon come to fruition .
According to Israeli intelligence , Iran may have acquired enough fissile material ( 5 Kg ) for one nuclear bomb by 2009 .
Stronger enemies
The second central conclusion reached by the Israeli intelligence community is one marked by relative optimism : Israel 's strategic standing has improved over the course of the previous year .
But even here , there are reservations , pointing to the also - improved military capabilities of Israel's .
In short : the threat of rockets and missiles attacks on the home front has only increased in 2007 – but the probability of a potential comprehensive assault on Israel in the next year or two has diminished .
According to military intelligence , the reasons for this are Israel 's deterrent capability - which grew substantially in the last year - and positive developments in the region .
The Annapolis Conference , for example , improved the regional standing of Israel and the United States .
The intelligence community expresses grave doubts regarding the ability of the peace process to bring about a Palestinian - Israeli agreement , but the conference 's very existence demonstrates that regional states are willing to cooperate with Washington and Jerusalem in their efforts to neutralize the threat of extremist Islam .

The political crisis in Lebanon constitutes a regional development which keeps Syria and Hizbullah occupied while complicating their position vis-à - vis the international community - decreasing the chances for war in the coming year .
According to the intelligence community 's estimate , the threat from Lebanon and Syria is second only to the Iranian threat , as any armed confrontation with these nations could lead to a full - scale war .
Intelligence sources say they have concrete evidence that Syria has amassed tens of thousands of missiles , heavy rockets , and Katyushas and has positioned them in sites from which they will be able to sow destruction across all of Israel , including the southern city of Beersheba .
Hizbullah has also replenished its heavy rocket arsenal , which has increased quantitatively and qualitatively from what it had before the 2006 Second Lebanon War .
Sanctions on Nasrallah
The good news is that Syria and Hizbullah , according to military intelligence , will not initiate an all - out attack in the coming year , as Israeli deterrent capacity has increased dramatically in the previous year for two reasons .
Events in the northern arena have proven not only Israel 's long range capabilities in airpower and intelligence , but also , and more importantly , they have demonstrated Israeli determination to thwart all threats and ability to make difficult and risky decisions when it comes to its defense .
The second reason for Israel 's improved capacity for deterrence : Iran , Syria , and Hizbullah have analyzed the results of the Lebanon war and agreed that launching a projectile offensive against the Israeli home front will harm them and their interests more than they will harm Israel .
Iran , for example was surprised by Israel 's ability to wipe out Hizbullah 's entire long - range rocket arsenal in less than an hour , long before the organization could launch even a single ' Zilzal . '
Furthermore - in a development published here for the first time - the Israeli Air Force was able , with the support of ground forces , to destroy all of Hizbullah 's medium - range rocket launchers ( 220 m m and 306 mm ) after they were used once or twice .
Tehran had , in the past , provided Hizbullah with an array of heavy rockets , to be used against Israel should Iran 's nuclear facilities be struck .
The near - total destruction of this launching system in the wake of the " local provocation " which Nasrallah initiated in July 2006 , stirred a great anger in Iran as well as a reevaluation of its relations with Hizbullah .
Nasrallah addressing supporters ( Photo : AP )
In the end Iran , along with Syria , agreed to replenish and expand the rocket array in Lebanon – but Hizbullah would henceforth have to receive explicit permission from Iran before firing a single rocket .
Representatives of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard in Lebanon have now been charged with supervising the execution of these orders .
Tehran , it is believed in Israel , will only grant this permission if they believe it will serve Iran 's strategic interests - highly unlikely in the next year or two .
During the last week , however , a caveat has cropped up in Israel 's perception of the strategic situation : according to Israeli intelligence officials , the American National Intelligence Estimate ( NIE ) has removed the looming threat of a possible American attack from over Iran .
Therefore , from Tehran 's perspective , this deterrent rocket system in Lebanon is less essential , which means that Iran is now more likely to permit Hizbullah to initiate rocket attacks on Israel even in a situation that will serve local , Hizbullah interests rather than only the larger , regional interests of Iran .
Meanwhile , the Syrians have registered the extent of damage Israel sowed in the Shiite Dahiyeh neighborhood of Beirut and on the Lebanese road system during the war and have come to the conclusion that their national infrastructure would likely suffer irreversible damage should they instigate a war with Israel before obtaining a more reliable anti-aircraft defense system .
This , Israeli officials said , has also dampened Syrian President Bashar Assad 's keenness for war .
However , they said , it has prompted the Syrians to double their efforts at procuring anti-aircraft systems and new aircraft from Russia .
But even here , sources point to a serious reservation : any substantial damage caused to Syria will be considered a blow to the nation 's honor by the Syrian regime .
" From their perspective , this is an account that they must settle with us , " a senior security source told Ynet .
" The Syrians are patient and have a very long memory ; it is entirely possible that they will attempt to carry out limited revenge attacks to settle the score with us . "
Such a move could manifest itself in a terror attack against a Jewish target abroad , an Israeli target such as the reactor in Dimona or Damascus may order an attack through one of its proxies – Hamas or Islamic Jihad .
Pressure on Gaza working
The third most serious threat , the report says , is Hamas in Gaza .
It is the least critical from a strategic point of view and does not necessarily pose an existential threat .
However , the intelligence ranks urged Israel to deal with it as soon as possible as – opposed to the other , hypothetical , threats – it is already wreaking havoc on the lives of Israelis in the south .
The rocket threat from Gaza will only grow next year , the officals say , as terror groups work to improve the
range and shelf - life of their arsenal .
But there are positive signs in the southern region : the military pressure and economic embargo on Gaza has led to Hamas rarely using its long - range rockets and leaving most of the missile attacks to extremist groups .
Its leaders are also publicly looking for a truce with Israel and political reconciliation with Mahmoud Abbas .
Carol Medenhall of Dibble , OK received two tickets : one for allowing her goats to be seen mating in her yard , and another for allowing her goats to be seen relieving themselves in her yard .
City law said it is illegal for any two animals to have sex in public within Dibble city limits .
It 's also against law for them to relieve themselves in public even if the animal is fenced in on private land .

Professor iPod has never bought one of Apple 's popular music players , but he can tell you why you need one .
Michael Bull , aka Professor iPod or Dr. iPod , is a professor in media and film at England 's University of Sussex who studies the cultural impact of digital music devices .
He has spent the last three years interviewing more than 1,000 iPod owners in the United States and abroad for his new book , Sound Moves : IPod Culture and Urban Experience .
As the stateside release of his book approaches , Wired News talked to Bull about the rise of the digital " urban Sherpa " and why the iPod is a one - stop shop for total bliss and daily rebellion in busy cities .
Wired News :
In your new book , you argue that the iPod acts as an urban Sherpa .
What exactly do you mean by that ?
Michael Bull :
It 's the idea that increasingly we use modern technologies to navigate us through our day .
In the Himalayas , you have Sherpas to help you through the mountains .
They know the route , they have the food and they take care of you ....
The iPod is a Sherpa – it has all the things that you want .
One of my ( interviewees ) said , " I store my valuables on the iPod ; it 's my data warehouse .
If the house burns down , I 'm not worried because the iPod has my family jewels .... "
The iPod navigates us through our moods , work , our daily life .
WN : How is the iPod changing the way we interact with public spaces ?
Bull :
The iPod allows people to control their environment , more so than any other technology .
In a world where we have little sense of control over our everyday lives , it can be very satisfying to control how you interact with your environment .
You have a playlist that you listen to while you 're out walking around New York ... certain songs that remind you of the city .
But the real sound of New York is shut off .
You 're controlling what your image of the city is .
We are fine - tuning the relationship between our own feelings and environment .
There 's a paradox between the cosmopolitan nature of a city and the iPod , which signifies something else .
As users become more locked into their increasingly subjective pleasure , they ... ( are remaking the ) world in their own image .
It 's the idea that , " I do n't want to hear loud people ; I want to be left alone , " and the iPod allows that .
The paradox is , cosmopolitism resides in the person 's iPod .
It 's often the most amazing array of music from around the world ; the rich mix of songs around the world contrasting with the chilly nature of the city ....
Where does diversity go ?
In our pocket .
WN : How , then , does the iPod affect our relationships with one another ?
Bull : People voluntarily spend their time away from their family , trapped in cars , on crowded tubes , traveling further and further for work and overall spending more and more time away from home ....
In a sense , urban culture is a culture of dislocation .
People are dislocated from their homes , so the technologies that we use are connectors that connect us back to each other .
IPod users , mobile phone users , are people who are always in another space .
They warm up these alienated spaces with their own pleasure .
But what we 're really seeing is an increasing denial of shared space .
In a street where everyone has headphones on , if someone shouts , no one can hear them .
Of course , if they could hear them , they still might not help .
But it furthers existing privacy tendencies in our culture .
It enables people to inhabit these spaces much more pleasurably but those ( shared ) spaces we pass through become increasingly chilly , socially .
WN : Is this increased dependence on gadgets a bad thing ?
Bull : I do n't think you can say it 's a bad thing .
It 's increasingly difficult for people to get away from things .
Your everyday life is accompanied by something .
People I talked to panicked if they did n't have their iPod .
And to that , you can't say , " Well you did n't have one five years ago , " because it 's become a passive part of the everyday ; it 's an integral part of our lives .
WN : Are we going to get burned out ?
Bull :
It 's good to switch things off sometimes , and maybe that ability is decreasing .
People take ( their iPods ) to Yellowstone ( National ) Park , or when they go watch humpback whales ....
Maybe the 21st - century culture is a culture where we do n't want to be alone without thoughts , so we need a mediator .
The only way we can get quiet is by constructing noise .
Many of the people I talked to had good jobs , and a lot of them used their iPods at work with headphones in order to concentrate .
The idea being that you can work more efficiently , and not be disturbed ....
IPod users are trying to become free by immersing themselves in consumer culture , but on their own terms ....
It 's a seamless experience and a way to reclaim the time they often feel is stolen ....
If you want to place the technology in a broader sense , the iPod does work to make people happier .
WN : And what about the iPhone ?
Can it replace the iPod as that source of music and connectivity ?
Bull : I did find a distinct relationship between an iPod and users ' mobile phones .
The iPod is a continuous experience they 're in control of , and the phone is discontinuous , and when it rings , it 's breaking that isolation bubble , so most people were n't keen on their mobile phones .
I finished the research before the iPhone ( came out ) but it just would n't be as popular because it has a different function .
It allows you to interact with the world in a different way .
WN : Has Apple expressed interest in your work ?
Bull :
The head of Apple 's research division contacted me and said he wanted our results , and I said , " I do n't have any . "
He wanted the quantity of things , and I said , " Well , I could give a seminar or come talk ( about our findings ) , " and he said , " Well , if there were no results , I can't make time for you .... "
Apple is as commercial as any other company , but it has this persona that people seem to be attracted to , which is very strange .
I do n't understand those Mac people , even though I have one myself .
I 've got several iPods now , people kept sending me iPods .
I 've never bought one .
They 've all been sent to me for free .
WN : What does the iPod obsession mean , in the bigger picture ?
Bull : Media technology is changing very fast , so if we can look at how we use it – this tells us where culture is going ... how we inhabit cities and how we construct our daily lives .
The iPod is indicating a new way in which consumers wish to act , which is individualism within consumption .
As a higher gas tax discouraged oil consumption , the Harvard University economist and former Bush adviser N. Gregory Mankiw has argued : “ the price of oil would fall in world markets .
As a result , the price of gas to [ U.S. ] consumers would rise by less than the increase in the tax .
Some of the tax would in effect be paid by Saudi Arabia and Venezuela . ”
But U.S. consumers would have known that , with a higher gasoline tax locked in for good , pump prices would never be going back to the old days , adds Mr. Verleger , so they would have a much stronger incentive to switch to more fuel - efficient vehicles and Detroit would have had to make more hybrids to survive .
This would have put Detroit five years ahead of where it is now .
“ It ’s called the America wins program , ” said Mr. Verleger , “ instead of the petro- states win program . ”
We simply cannot go on being as dumb as we wanna be .
If you hate the war in Iraq , then you want a gasoline tax so you can argue that we can pull out of there without remaining dependent on an even more unstable region .
If you want to see us negotiate with Iran , not bomb it , you want a gasoline tax that will give us some real leverage by helping to reduce the income of the ayatollahs .
If you ’re a conservative and you believed that the Iraq war was necessary to drive reform in the Middle East , but the war has failed to do that and we need “ Plan B ” for the same objective , you want a gasoline tax that will reduce the flow of wealth to petrolist leaders who will never change if all they have to do is drill well holes rather than educate and empower their people .
If you want to see America thrive by becoming the most energy productive economy in the world — a title that now belongs to Japan , which does n’t have a drop of oil in its soil — you want a gasoline tax , which will only spur U.S. innovation in energy efficiency .
President Bush squandered a historic opportunity to put America on a radically different energy course after 9/11 .
But considering how few Democrats or Republicans are ready to tell the people the truth on this issue , maybe we have the president we deserve .
I refuse to believe that , but I ’m starting to doubt myself .

Alabama governor accused of violating campaign finance laws Muriel Kane
Published : Friday December 28 , 2007
del.icio.us |
Print This Email This Alabama 's Republican Governor Bob Riley may have attempted to conceal illegal corporate donations to his 2002 and 2006 campaigns by representing them in campaign finance reports as having come from individuals , according to an an investigation carried out by the Montgomery Independent .
Riley 's campaigns have been under close scrutiny during the past several weeks , with questions being raised about his narrow victory over incumbent Don Siegelman in 2002 , followed by Siegelman 's prosecution on what many consider to be trumped - up charges when he proposed to run again in 2006 .
An ongoing RAW STORY investigative series has explored the 2002 Alabama governor 's election , in which Riley pulled ahead only when a last minute change in the tally switched several thousand votes in one county from Siegelman 's column to Riley 's and the state 's Republican attorney general refused to allow a recount .
Karl
Rove is alleged to have been directly involved in that election , working together with longtime Alabama GOP operative William Canary .
The Montgonery Independent has now found that in 2006 , the Riley campaign reported the use of airplanes owned by two corporations as if they were personal " in-kind " donations from the presidents of those corporations .
It also listed the provision of an advertising billboard as a personal donation from the president of the ad agency .
Together , these in - kind donations had a value of over $ 25,000 , far beyond the $ 500 limit allowed for any one corporation in a single election cycle Montgomery Independent publisher Bob Martin has called for further investigation of the matter , stating in an editorial , " The question which stands out front - and - center is whether or not the listing of individuals instead of the true corporate donors was intentional , as in to bypass the legal limits on corporate donations or was just a mistake in reporting . "
Although still expressing willingness to give Riley a chance to clear himself , Martin is prepared to call for legal action if he does not .
" This is a serious violation of the law on the part of the governors campaign if what we have uncovered cannot be refuted -- just as serious as the matters for which former Gov. Don Siegelman was convicted .
The governor must come clean on this and correct his campaign reports .
If he doesnt either the state attorney general or the Montgomery district attorney should take action . "

You ’ve seen or at least heard of Dateline NBC ’s series of using hidden cameras to identify and expose sexual predators , right ?
Well , it appears as though Dateline was working on a new series of hidden camera reporting involving exposing hackers , and unfortunately for them , it turned into “ To Catch a Reporter . ”
It all started at DEFCON 15 , the largest underground hacking convention in the World that took place from August 3 – 5 in Las Vegas .
According to ZDNet , Dateline sent a reporter ( Michelle Madigan ) who was “ trying to do a shock piece for NBC Dateline to show middle America how criminal underground hackers had descended on DEFCON Las Vegas to learn tricks of the trade and how Federal Agents were tracking them down . ”
Somehow DEFCON organizers found out what she was up to and asked her on multiple occasions if she wanted official press credentials , and gave her the opportunity to get a press badge .
She declined , because the intent was to pose as a casual attender of the conference so she could get confessions on tape with her hidden camera .
In a room filled with attendees , one of the DEFCON staff members stood up to announce a new contest that he said would involve the audience called “ spot the undercover reporter . ”
He explained trust was very important at DEFCON and it came to their attention that a reporter might be there with a hidden camera– not as press– recording people for a piece on hackers .
When he announced that the reporter was going to be escorted out , she fled on her own and a herd of DEFCON attendees followed and videotaped her as she walked to her car in “ to catch a predator ” style .
So here it is , “ To Catch a Reporter , ” caught on tape :

{ 1} A SPECTER is haunting Eastern Europe : the specter of what in the West is called " dissent "
This specter has not appeared out of thin air .
It is a natural and inevitable consequence of the present historical phase of the system it is haunting .
It was born at a time when this system , for a thousand reasons , can no longer base itself on the unadulterated , brutal , and arbitrary application of power , eliminating all expressions of nonconformity .
What is more , the system has become so ossified politically that there is practically no way for such nonconformity to be implemented within its official structures .
. . .
{ 2} Our system is most frequently characterized as a dictatorship or , more precisely , as the dictatorship of a political bureaucracy over a society which has undergone economic and social leveling .
I am afraid that the term " dictatorship , " regardless of how intelligible it may otherwise be , tends to obscure rather than clarify the real nature of power in this system .
. .
Even though our dictatorship has long since alienated itself completely from the social movements that give birth to it , the authenticity of these movements ( and I am thinking of the proletarian and socialist movements of the nineteenth century ) gives it undeniable historicity .
These origins provided a solid foundation of sorts on which it could build until it became the utterly new social and political reality it is today , which has become so inextricably a part of the structure of the modern world .
. . .
It commands an incomparably more precise , logically structured , generally comprehensible and , in essence , extremely flexible ideology that , in its elaborateness and completeness , is almost a secularized religion .
It offers a ready answer to any question whatsoever ; it can scarcely be accepted only in part , and accepting it has profound implications for human life .
In an era when metaphysical and existential certainties are in a state of crisis , when people are being uprooted and alienated and are losing their sense of what this world means , this ideology inevitably has a certain hypnotic charm .
. . .
{ 3} The profound difference between our system - in terms of the nature of power - and what we traditionally understand by dictatorship , a difference I hope is clear even from this quite superficial comparison , has caused me to search for some term appropriate for our system , purely for the purposes of this essay .
If I refer to it henceforth as a " post- totalitarian " system , I am fully aware that this is perhaps not the most precise term , but I am unable to think of a better one .
I do not wish to imply by the prefix " post " that the system is no longer totalitarian ; on the contrary , I mean that it is totalitarian in a way fundamentally different from classical dictatorships , different from totalitarianism as we usually understand it .
. . . .
{ 4} The manager of a fruit - and - vegetable shop places in his window , among the onions and carrots , the slogan : " Workers of the world , unite ! "
Why does he do it ?
What is he trying to communicate to the world ?
Is he genuinely enthusiastic about the idea of unity among the workers of the world ?
Is his enthusiasm so great that he feels an irrepressible impulse to acquaint the public with his ideals ?
Has he really given more than a moment 's thought to how such a unification might occur and what it would mean ?
{ 5} I think it can safely be assumed that the overwhelming majority of shopkeepers never think about the slogans they put in their windows , nor do they use them to express their real opinions .
That poster was delivered to our greengrocer from the enterprise headquarters along with the onions and carrots .
He put them all into the window simply because it has been done that way for years , because everyone does it , and because that is the way it has to be .
If he were to refuse , there could be trouble .
He could be reproached for not having the proper decoration in his window ; someone might even accuse him of disloyalty .
He does it because these things must be done if one is to get along in life .
It is one of the thousands of details that guarantee him a relatively tranquil life " in harmony with society , " as they say .
{ 6 } Obviously the greengrocer . . . does not put the slogan in his window from any personal desire to acquaint the public with the ideal it expresses .
This , of course , does not mean that his action has no motive or significance at all , or that the slogan communicates nothing to anyone .
The slogan is really a sign , and as such it contains a subliminal but very definite message .
Verbally , it might be expressed this way : " I , the greengrocer XY , live here and I know what I must do .
I behave in the manner expected of me .
I can be depended upon and am beyond reproach .
I am obedient and therefore I have the right to be left in peace . "
This message , of course , has an addressee : it is directed above , to the greengrocer 's superior , and at the same time it is a shield that protects the greengrocer from potential informers .
The slogan 's real meaning , therefore , is rooted firmly in the greengrocer 's existence .
It reflects his vital interests .
But what are those vital interests ?
{ 7 } Let us take note : if the greengrocer had been instructed to display the slogan " I am afraid and therefore unquestioningly obedient ; ' he would not be nearly as indifferent to its semantics , even though the statement would reflect the truth .
The greengrocer would be embarrassed and ashamed to put such an unequivocal statement of his own degradation in the shop window , and quite naturally so , for he is a human being and thus has a sense of his own dignity .
To overcome this complication , his expression of loyalty must take the form of a sign which , at least on its textual surface , indicates a level of disinterested conviction .
It must allow the greengrocer to say , " What 's wrong with the workers of the world uniting ? "
Thus the sign helps the greengrocer to conceal from himself the low foundations of his obedience , at the same time concealing the low foundations of power .
It hides them behind the facade of something high .
And that something is ideology .
{ 8} Ideology is a specious way of relating to the world .
It offers human beings the illusion of an identity , of dignity , and of morality while making it easier for them to part with them .
As the repository of something suprapersonal and objective , it enables people to deceive their conscience and conceal their true position and their inglorious modus vivendi , both from the world and from themselves .
It is a very pragmatic but , at the same time , an apparently dignified way of legitimizing what is above , below , and on either side .
It is directed toward people and toward God .
It is a veil behind which human beings can hide their own fallen existence , their trivialization , and their adaptation to the status quo .
It is an excuse that everyone can use , from the greengrocer , who conceals his fear of losing his job behind an alleged interest in the unification of the workers of the world , to the highest functionary , whose interest in staying in power can be cloaked in phrases about service to the working class .
The primary excusatory function of ideology , therefore , is to provide people , both as victims and pillars of the post - totalitarian system , with the illusion that the system is in harmony with the human order and the order of the universe .
. . .
{ 9} The post - totalitarian system touches people at every step , but it does so with its ideological gloves on .
This is why life in the system is so thoroughly permeated with hypocrisy and lies : government by bureaucracy is called popular government ; the working class is enslaved in the name of the working class ; the complete degradation of the individual is presented as his ultimate liberation ; depriving people of information is called making it available ; the use of power to manipulate is called the public control of power , and the arbitrary abuse of power is called observing the legal code ; the repression of culture is called its development ; the expansion of imperial influence is presented as support for the oppressed ; the lack of free expression becomes the highest form of freedom ; farcical elections become the highest form of democracy ; banning independent thought becomes the most scientific of world views ; military occupation becomes fraternal assistance .
Because the regime is captive to its own lies , it must falsify everything .
It falsifies the past .
It falsifies the present , and it falsifies the future .
It falsifies statistics .
It pretends not to possess an omnipotent and unprincipled police apparatus .
It pretends to respect human rights .
It pretends to persecute no one .
It pretends to fear nothing .
It pretends to pretend nothing .
{ 10} Individuals need not believe all these mystifications , but they must behave as though they did , or they must at least tolerate them in silence , or get along well with those who work with them .
For this reason , however , they must live within a lie .
They need not accept the lie .
It is enough for them to have accepted their life with it and in it .
For by this very fact , individuals confirm the system , fulfill the system , make the system , are the system .
. . . .
{ 11} Why in fact did our greengrocer have to put his loyalty on display in the shop window ?
Had he not already displayed it sufficiently in various internal or semipublic ways ?
At trade union meetings , after all , he had always voted as he should .
He had always taken part in various competitions .
He voted in elections like a good citizen .
He had even signed the " antiCharter . "
Why , on top of all that , should he have to declare his loyalty publicly ?
After all , the people who walk past his window will certainly not stop to read that , in the greengrocer 's opinion , the workers of the world ought to unite .
The fact of the matter is , they do n't read the slogan at all , and it can be fairly assumed they do n't even see it .
If you were to ask a woman who had stopped in front of his shop what she saw in the window , she could certainly tell whether or not they had tomatoes today , but it is highly unlikely that she noticed the slogan at all , let alone what it said .
{ 12} It seems senseless to require the greengrocer to declare his loyalty publicly .
But it makes sense nevertheless .
People ignore his slogan , but they do so because such slogans are also found in other shop windows , on lampposts , bulletin boards , in apartment windows , and on buildings ; they are everywhere , in fact .
They form part of the panorama of everyday life .
Of course , while they ignore the details , people are very aware of that panorama as a whole .
And what else is the greengrocer 's slogan but a small component in that huge backdrop to daily life ?
{ 13 } The greengrocer had to put the slogan in his window , therefore , not in the hope that someone might read it or be persuaded by it , but to contribute , along with thousands of other slogans , to the panorama that everyone is very much aware of .
This panorama , of course , has a subliminal meaning as well : it reminds people where they are living and what is expected of them .
It tells them what everyone else is doing , and indicates to them what they must do as well , if they do n't want to be excluded , to fall into isolation , alienate themselves from society , break the rules of the game , and risk the loss of their peace and tranquility and security .
. . .
{ 14 } Let us now imagine that one day something in our greengrocer snaps and he stops putting up the slogans merely to ingratiate himself .
He stops voting in elections he knows are a farce .
He begins to say what he really thinks at political meetings .
And he even finds the strength in himself to express solidarity with those whom his conscience commands him to support .
In this revolt the greengrocer steps out of living within the lie .
He rejects the ritual and breaks the rules of the game .
He discovers once more his suppressed identity and dignity .
He gives his freedom a concrete significance .
His revolt is an attempt to live within the truth .
. . .
{ 15 } The bill is not long in coming .
He will be relieved of his post as manager of the shop and transferred to the warehouse .
His pay will be reduced .
His hopes for a holiday in Bulgaria will evaporate .
His children 's access to higher education will be threatened .
His superiors will harass him and his fellow workers will wonder about him .
Most of those who apply these sanctions , however , will not do so from any authentic inner conviction but simply under pressure from conditions , the same conditions that once pressured the greengrocer to display the official slogans .
They will persecute the greengrocer either because it is expected of them , or to demonstrate their loyalty , or simply as part of the general panorama , to which belongs an awareness that this is how situations of this sort are dealt with , that this , in fact , is how things are always done , particularly if one is not to become suspect oneself .
The executors , therefore , behave essentially like everyone else , to a greater or lesser degree : as components of the post - totalitarian system , as agents of its automatism , as petty instruments of the social auto - totality .
{ 16 } Thus the power structure , through the agency of those who carry out the sanctions , those anonymous components of the system , will spew the greengrocer from its mouth .
The system , through its alienating presence in people , will punish him for his rebellion .
It must do so because the logic of its automatism and self - defense dictate it .
The greengrocer has not committed a simple , individual offense , isolated in its own uniqueness , but something incomparably more serious .
By breaking the rules of the game , he has disrupted the game as such .
He has exposed it as a mere game .
He has shattered the world of appearances , the fundamental pillar of the system .
He has upset the power structure by tearing apart what holds it together .
He has demonstrated that living a lie is living a lie .
He has broken through the exalted facade of the system and exposed the real , base foundations of power .
He has said that the emperor is naked .
And because the emperor is in fact naked , something extremely dangerous has happened : by his action , the greengrocer has addressed the world .
He has enabled everyone to peer behind the curtain .
He has shown everyone that it is possible to live within the truth .
Living within the lie can constitute the system only if it is universal .
The principle must embrace and permeate everything .
There are no terms whatsoever on which it can co-exist with living within the truth , and therefore everyone who steps out of line denies it in principle and threatens it in its entirety .

An international team of scientists said Thursday that they have tracked down the origin of the mysterious “ Oh - My - God ” particle -- a cosmic ray bearing energies millions of times larger than the most powerful particle accelerator can produce on Earth .
Researchers at the Pierre Auger Observatory , a complex of detectors spread over a Rhode Island - sized slice of the South American prairie , said the most likely source for these ultra - high - energy particles is a type of black hole found at the center of some galaxies .
These violent phenomena are called active galactic nuclei because they both gobble up energy from the surrounding space and spit some out with tremendous force .
“ This is a fundamental discovery .
We have taken a big step forward in solving the mystery of the nature and origin of the highest - energy cosmic rays , ” said Nobel laureate James Cronin , a professor emeritus at the University of Chicago and coauthor of the paper published in the current issue of the journal Science .

Cosmic rays are charged particles that can strike with the force of a thrown baseball .
Fortunately for humans , Earth ’s atmosphere serves as a shield , preventing the particles from reaching the surface .
The origin of cosmic rays , particularly the high - energy ones , has been a mystery since their discovery in 1938 by French scientist Pierre Auger .
Scientists have only been able to speculate over what tumultuous processes could accelerate particles to energy levels 100 million times more powerful than anything produced at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Illinois , Earth ’s most powerful accelerator .
One of the chief candidates was black holes at the center of many galaxies , mainly because these are some of the most energetic objects in the universe .
But tracking the source of the particles has been difficult , in part because of their rarity .
Each century , only one of the highest - energy particles -- sometimes called Oh - My - God particles -- strikes the atmosphere over any particular spot on Earth .

To research them , “ You either need very long - lived scientists or an instrument covering a very large area , ” said Henry Glass , a Fermilab particle physicist and a coauthor of the paper .
Besides being large , the detector had to be sophisticated enough to spot the cascade of billions of secondary particles that rain down when a high - energy cosmic ray hits the upper atmosphere .
That was the thinking behind the $ 54 - million Auger Observatory , a collaboration of 17 nations and 370 scientists .
The facility covers 1,200 square miles of Argentina ’s Pampa Amarilla , or yellow prairie .
To trace the course of the secondary particles , known as extensive air showers , the observatory employs two types of detectors .
One is made up of scores of ultra- pure - water tanks that register the energy and path of arriving secondary particles .
The second is a set of telescopes spread around the observatory to spot the ultraviolet fluorescence that occurs when a high - energy particle hits the nitrogen in the upper atmosphere .

“ What we ’re doing is using the atmosphere as an amplifier , ” Glass said .
The Auger detectors went to work nearly four years ago , even before construction was complete .
So far , Glass said , the detectors have tracked 27 high - energy cosmic ray events .
At least 20 led back to previously known active galactic nuclei .
Two of the high - energy events were traced to a single galaxy , Centaurus A -- also known as the Hamburger Galaxy -- about 13.7 million light - years away .

Active galactic nuclei make up only about 1 % of all galactic black holes .
New ones are made when galaxies collide .
The black holes spring to life , gobbling up pieces of the other galaxy .
Tracking the high - energy rays is just the first stage in the new field of cosmic ray astronomy , said Cronin , who conceived the Auger Observatory .
“ In the next few years , our data will permit us to identify the exact sources of these cosmic rays and how they accelerate these particles , ” he said .
Scientists also hope to open a similar observatory in the Northern Hemisphere .
A site in Colorado has already been selected , Glass said .

It ’s one of several shows in recent history that was one of the best on TV … and yet no one watched it .
Arrested Development has one of the most loyal followings I ’ve ever seen for a show .
It re-introduced us all to Jason Bateman and showed us his true potential for being able to lead and carry a project , and it was the coming out party for Michael Cera who has since exploded ( catch him in the new film that ’s already getting some serious Oscar buzz “ Juno ” ) .
Ever since the show went off air , the fans have hoped for , prayed for and speculated about the chance for an Arrested Development movie .
Thus far all rumors and hopes have been pretty much dashed .
BUT NOW … Jason Bateman is flaming those hopes and prayers .
MTV talked with Bateman who said this past week he spoke with Arrested Development director creator Mitchell Hurwitz and said that the hopes for a movie are still quite alive and well .
The angle was , that since the writers strike prevents all WGA members from writing things they ’re getting paid for , it is leaving Hurwitz with the time to start developing an Arrested Development movie .
Instead of trying to describe it all … just check out Bateman talking about it himself :
' It 's delayed , not canceled , ' rep for book 's publisher says ; CEO / president insists it will be a memoir , not a parenting guide .
On the heels of the announcement that Britney Spears ' 16 - year - old sister , Jamie Lynn , is pregnant with her first child comes word that the book due for release in the spring from the girls ' mom , Lynne Spears , has been delayed .
On Thursday , publisher Thomas Nelson — which puts out inspirational literature and Bibles — issued a statement on its
Web site insisting that the book , which is to be released under the title " Pop Culture Mom : A Real Story of Fame and Family in a Tabloid World , " will not be a parenting guide , as had previously been reported , but rather a memoir .
" Lynne 's memoir will provide a window into the real - life world of fame and worldly success , including the toll it extracts from some who aspire to it , " Michael S. Hyatt , the president and CEO of the publisher , said in the statement .
" It will provide a much - needed corrective to a world obsessed with the wrong priorities . "
Hyatt added , " We believe in redemption .
Therefore , we are standing with Lynne and her family during this difficult time .
Though the book has been delayed , we believe God is at work .
The story is still being written , and we are confident in His ability to turn ashes into beauty . "
According to People magazine , " Pop Culture Mom " is on indefinite hold .
A spokesperson , who was not named , told the mag that " The book is delayed indefinitely .
It 's delayed , not canceled . "
The book , which Publishers Weekly had previously described as " Lynne Spears ' personal story of raising high - profile children while coming from a low - profile Louisiana community , " was actually put on hold last week , the spokesperson said .
The spokesperson had declined to say whether the focus of the book would change in light of Jamie Lynn 's pregnancy announcement , or if the decision was a result of the news about the latest scandal to rock the family .
Lindsey Nobles , a spokeswoman for Thomas Nelson , elaborated on the indefinite hiatus to The Associated Press but did not specify whether the delay was due to Jamie Lynn 's pregnancy .
" I can tell you that we are standing behind Lynne and supporting her decision to be with her family at this time , " she reportedly said .
In October , Spears and Thomas Nelson announced the deal for the book , which was slated to come out on Mother 's Day .
At the time , a publishing rep who was not named told Us Weekly that it would be a parenting book " that 's going to have faith elements to it . "
A manuscript was expected by this month .
In a 1999 interview with MTV News , Jamie Lynn talked about her nascent performing career , leading John Norris to ask Lynne if she would like to see her younger daughter follow in Britney 's footsteps .
" Oh yeah , " Lynne replied .
" That would be fun .
I 've enjoyed every minute of it . "

The International Olympic Committee has rejected an attempt by Tibet to field its own team at the 2008 Beijing Olympics .
Delegates from the unofficial Tibetan National Olympic Committee met with Olympic officialsMonday at the IOC headquarters in Lausanne , Switzerland .
Outside , more than 100 supporters , including some Buddhist monks , waved banners and Tibetan flags .
However , a spokesman for the Tibetan group , Wangpo Tethong , said later that the IOC was not in a position to accept its application .
Michel Filliau , a senior IOC official who took part in the meeting , said a rule change in 1996 means only national committees from countries recognized by the international community can take part in the Olympics .
A special exemption is granted only to those territories whose national committees were recognized before 1996 , such as those for the Palestinian territories , Hong Kong and Taiwan , which competes as Chinese Taipei .
" In this particular case , athletes from the [ Tibet ] region would fall under the National Olympic Committee of China , " said IOC spokeswoman Giselle Davies .
Beijing dismissed outright the request from Tibet , which has been controlled by China since 1951 .
" Tibet is part of China 's territory , " the Beijing organizing committee said Monday in a statement .
" The possibility of participating in the Beijing Olympics as a separate group does not exist . "
Tethong said he was " frustrated " by what he felt was the IOC alienating itself from its original principles .
" We have about 30 athletes , all Tibetan refugees , scattered around the world , " he said .
" None of them want to start under the Chinese flag . "
Tethong was accompanied at the meeting by Jigme Puenkang , a 25 - year - old sprinter from Zurich , and Dominik Kelsang Erne , a table tennis player who has competed at the national level in Switzerland .
Delicate issues
" We want to send a message of hope to the people of Tibet , who are suffering under the Chinese occupation , " Erne said .
Adolf Ogi , a former Swiss president who now serves as United Nations envoy for sports and peace , said it was unlikely that UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon would intervene on the Tibetans ' behalf .
" We tried it with Kosovo for the soccer World Cup and the Olympic Games , and we failed , " he told the Associated Press .
" Even if the UN expressed an opinion , the decision rests with the IOC . "
Tibet is one of several delicate issues Olympic officials have had to deal with in the run-up to next year 's games .
Worries over Beijing 's high air pollution , reporting restrictions on foreign journalists and criticism of China 's human rights record have also forced the IOC to engage in careful diplomacy ahead of the Olympics , which begin Aug .

ネットでの出会いについて
インターネットの普及によって多くの方がネットでも出会えるようになってきています。ネットのどういった所で出会いがあるのかというと例えば出会い系サイト、チャットサイト、コミュニティーサイトなど多彩にわたっています。そこでネットでの出会いについてお話します。
出会い系サイトやコミュニティーサイトがメインになってきますけど、まずサイトに登録して異性を探していきます。サイト内でメールのやり取りをして気にいれば自分の携帯のアドレスなどを教えたりしていきます。無料と有料のものがあり、どちらがいいとは言えませんけど、安全性の高いサイトを利用するのが大切です。
ネットでの出会いは手軽に出会える事ができますけど、相手の顔が分からない分、多少の警戒は必要になってきます。きちんと相手を見極める必要がありますし、実際に出会う事になれば人が多くいる場所で会うなどといった事も必要です。
手軽に出会えますので仕事で忙しい人にとってみれば異性と出会えるチャンスを増やす効果もあります。実際にネットの出会いから付き合っている人もいますしうまく活用すれば恋人もできる可能性があるのです。
警戒はしなければなりませんが、出会いの幅は広がります。
腐るほどネットでの出会いの場所はあります。実際に出会うまでにたどり着ければ、最高なのですが、すべての人がそんなに順調に行くのは難しいのが現実です。
その理由のひとつとして、間違った出会いサイトを利用していることが挙げられます。
ではサイトを選ぶ際の基準として大切なのは一体どういった部分なのでしょうか。
正直、素人のユーザーがそこを見抜くことはかなり困難です。実際にユーザーが利用して、出会えたという結果が得られたようなサイトを利用するのが最も効率良く出会いをすることができるということです。新潟出会い〜優良サイトランキング〜とか石川出会いのサイトでも、多くの人たちが実際に出会えているサイトだけをランキングで紹介しているサイトです。新潟や石川在住の人たちからすれば、このサイトを利用しない手はありません。それくらいに信頼できるサイトだと思ってください。
もちろん東京出会いや福岡出会いに対応しているようなサイトもあります。ネットでの出会いだからといっても、実際に会うのは自分たちが住んでいる地域です。ということは、地域密着型というのが重要なのは分かるはずです。
色んな人たちが実際に利用してみて、本当に相手と会うことが出来たサイトだけを教えております。石川でも東京でも、福岡でも新潟でもどこでもすべてが優良の出会えるサイトです。
インターネットでの出会いというものに恐れずにルールを守って利用するべきです。そうすれば、あなたの強い味方になるのは言うまでもありません。
市の図書館で出会った彼
私は読書がとても好きです。毎日一冊以上の本を読んでいます。一見とても地味に見られる趣味ですが、毎日がとても楽しいです。
私はもともとは根っからの恋愛体質なのですが、何年か前に振られてしまってから、恋愛に対して臆病になっていました。
素敵な男性と出会えないかなと毎日空想をしながらすごしていましたが、そんなとき奇跡が起きたのです。
いつものように市の図書館に行ったところ、普段座っている席に見知らぬ男性が座っていました。日曜の朝なのに、高そうなスーツを着て本を読まれていました。
男性はなにか調べ物をしているようでした。私がどこに座ろうかと考えていると、男性に呼び止められました。私の持っていた本を読みたいというのです。私はいつもなら断るところですが、その男性があまりにもかっこいいのでオーケーしてしまいました。
男性はとある会社の社長さんで、調べ物をしているとのことでした。社長さんなのに気取ったところがなくて、しかもかっこいい。私はその男性に惹かれました。
「こんなところで出会ったのも何かの縁だから」と男性は私をお茶に誘ってくれました。お茶をしているとき、「出会い系サイトを経営しているんだ」と男性は私に名刺をくれました。
家に帰ってから携帯を見ると、その男性からメールがきていました。「出会い系サイトには登録しないでね。僕が居るから」とのこと。今は彼と仲良く付き合っています。
スマホで出会う人達が増えている
今私の周りでは、スマホを利用した出会いが増えているようです。
出会い専門のアプリを利用したり、TwitterやFaceBookなどのSNSサイト、ブログなどでLINEやskype等のIDを交換するなどなど、方法は沢山あるようです。
また、出会い専用のアプリでは、GPS機能を使って近くにいる人がわかったり、項目を入力すると気の合いそうな相手を紹介してくれたりなど、とても便利な機能があるようです。 また 、Twitter やFaceBookは、本名や写真などを投稿している場合が多く、某ゲームSNSサイトのようにアドレス交換（直メ）禁止などという取り決めもないため、出会いの場として利用する人が多いようです。たしかに、本名や経歴、会社などのわかる相手だと安心できます。
後はガラゲー時代からあったブログでのなれ合いの時に、アドレスではなくLINE、Skypeなどを利用する方法ですね。私自身たしかにアドレスよりIDの方が気軽に交換出来ると思います。
以前はやっていたメル友文化もLINE友に変わったりしているようです。 実際にFaceBookを通じて結婚したカップルや、アプリを使って知り合い、交際しているカップルなども周りにいるので、以前よりネットで出会うことのハードルが下がっているのを感じます。
出会い方も変わってきているのですね。
男女の出会いはインターネットが便利
How to configure NFS on Linux
Introduction
The Network File System is certainly one of the most widely used network services .
Network file system ( NFS ) is based on the Remote procedure call which allows the client to automatically mount remote file systems and therefore transparently provide an access to it as if the file system is local .
Scenario
In this scenario we are going to export the file system from the an IP address 10.1.1.50 ( NFS server ) host and mount it on an a host with an IP address 10.1.1.55 ( NFS Client ) .
Both NFS server and NFS client will be running Ubuntu Linux .
Prerequisites
At this point , we assume that the NFS service daemon is already installed on your system , including portmap daemon on which NFS setup depends .
If you have not done so yet simply install nfs -common package on both NFS client and NFS server using using apt - get tool .
# apt - get install nfs-common
The command above will fetch and install all support files common to NFS client and NFS server including portmap .
Additionally we need to install extra package on our NFS server side .
apt - get install nfs-kernel - server
This package is the actual NFS daemon listenning on both UDP and TCP 2049 ports .
Execute rpcinfo -p to check correctness of your NFS installation and to actually confirm that NFS server is indeed running and accepting calls on a port 2049 :
# rpcinfo -p | grep nfs 100003 2 udp 2049 nfs 100003 3 udp 2049 nfs 100003 4 udp 2049 nfs 100003 2 tcp 2049 nfs 100003 3 tcp 2049 nfs 100003 4 tcp 2049 nfs
Furthermore , before we start exporting and mounting NFS directories , your system needs to actually support network file system .
To check whether your system supports NFS grep / proc / filesystems and search for nfs .
# cat / proc / filesystems | grep nfs nodev nfs nodev nfs4
If you do not see any output it means that NFS is not supported or the NFS module have not been loaded into your kernel .
To load NFS module execute :
# modprobe nfs
When installed correctly , the NFS daemon should be now listening on both UDP and TCP 2049 port and portmap should be waiting for instructions on a port 111 .
At this point you should have portmap listening on both NFS server and NFS client :
rpcinfo -p | grep portmap 100000 2 tcp 111 portmapper 100000 2 udp 111 portmapper

Server export file
All directories we want to share over the network using NFS need to be defined on the server side of this communication and more specifically they need to be defind with /etc / exports file .
In the next section you will see most common NFS exports :
Most common exports options
Here are the most common NFS export techniques and options :
/home/nfs/ 10.1.1.55 ( rw , sync ) export / home / nfs directory for host with an IP address 10.1.1.55 with read , write permissions , and synchronized mode / home / nfs / 10.1.1.0/24 ( ro , sync ) export / home / nfs directory for network 10.1.1.0 with netmask 255.255.255.0 with read only permissions and synchronized mode / home / nfs / 10.1.1.55 ( rw , sync ) 10.1.1.10 ( ro , sync ) export / home / nfs directory for host with IP 10.1.1.55 with read , write permissions , synchronized mode , and also export / home / nfs directory for another host with an IP address 10.1.1.10 with read only permissions and synchronized mode / home / nfs / 10.1.1.55 ( rw , sync, no_root_squash ) export / home / nfs directory for host with an IP address 10.1.1.55 with read , write permissions , synchronized mode and the remote root user will be treated as a root and will be able to change any file and directory .
/ home / nfs/ *( ro , sync ) export / home / nfs directory for any host with read only permissions and synchronized mode / home / nfs / *.linuxconfig.org ( ro, sync ) export / home / nfs directory for any host within linuxconfig.org domain with a read only permission and synchronized mode / home / nfs / foobar ( rw , sync ) export / home / nfs directory for hostname foobar with read , write permissions and synchronized mode
Edit exports file
Now that we have familiarized our selfs with some NFS 's export options we can define our first NFS export .
Open up your favorite text editor , for example , vim and edit /etc / exports file by adding a line / home / nfs/ * ( ro , sync ) which will export / home / nfs directory for any host with read only permissions .
Instead of text editor you can simply insert your NFS export line into /etc / exports file using echo command :
# echo '/ home/nfs / *( ro , sync ) ' >
/etc/exports # tail - 1 /etc/exports /home/nfs/ *( ro, sync )
Be sure that the directory you are about to export by NFS exists .
You can also create a file inside the / home / nfs directory which will help you troubleshoot once you mount / home / nfs/ remotely .
# touch / home / nfs / nfs - test - file
NOTE : The default behavior of NFS kernel daemon is to include additional option to your export line which is " no_subtree_check " .
Be aware of this fact when you attempt to configure your NFS exports further .
Restart NFS daemon
Once you have edited / etc / exports file you need to restart your NFS daemon to apply any changes .
Depending on your Linux distribution the restarting procedure of NFS may differ .
Ubuntu and Debian users :
# /etc/init.d/nfs-kernel-server restart
Redhat and Fedora users
# /etc/init.d/nfs restart
If you later decide to add more NFS exports to the /etc / exports file , you will need to either restart NFS daemon or run command exportfs :
# exportfs -ra
Mount remote file system on client
First we need to create a mount point :
# mkdir /home / nfs_local
If you are sure that the NFS client and mount point are ready , you can run the mount command to mount exported NFS remote file system :
# mount 10.1.1.50:/home/nfs /home/nfs_local
In case that you need to specify a filesystem type you can do this by :
# mount -t nfs 10.1.1.50:/home/nfs /home/nfs_local
You may also get and an error message :
mount : mount to NFS server failed : timed out ( retrying ) .
This may mean that your server supports higher NFS version and therefore you need to pass one extra argument to your nfs client mount command .
In this example we use nfs version 3 :
# mount -t nfs -o nfsvers=3 10.1.1.50:/home/nfs /home/nfs_local
In any case now you should be able to access a remote / home / nfs directory locally on your NFS client .
# ls /home / nfs_local / nfs - test - file # cd /home / nfs_local / # ls nfs - test - file # touch test touch : cannot touch `test ' : Read - only file system
The above output proves that a remote NFS export is mounted and that we can access it by navigating to a local / home / nfs_local / directory .
Please notice that the touch command reports that the filesystem is mounted as read - only which was exactly our intention .
Configure automount
To make this completely transparent to end users , you can automount the NFS file system every time a user boots a Linux system , or you can also use PAM modules to mount once a user logs in with a proper username and password .
In this situation just edit /etc / fstab to mount system automatically during a system boot .
You can use your favorite editor and create new line like this within /etc / fstab :
10.1.1.50:/home/nfs /home/nfs_local / nfs defaults 0 0
as before you also use echo command to do that :
# echo " 10.1.1.50:/home/nfs /home/nfs_local / nfs defaults 0 0 " >> /etc/fstab # tail - 1 /etc/fstab 10.1.1.50:/home/nfs /home/nfs_local / nfs defaults 0 0
Conclusion
The Network File System comes with tons of export options .
What has been shown here , just barely scratches the surface of NFS .

Appendix A
Following section of this NFS tutorial is going to be devoted to RedHat and Fedora Linux systems which by default block all incoming traffic to a NFS server by engaging firewall using iptables rules .
For this reason when the firewall is running on your NFS server , you might get this error when mounting NFS filesytem :
mount.nfs : mount to NFS server ' 10.1.1.13 ' failed : System Error : No route to host .
This error message has nothing to do with your NFS configuration , all what needs to be done is either turn off the firewall or add iptables rules to allow traffic on portmap port 111 , nfs port 2049 and random ports for other nfs services .
There are two solutions to this problem : easy solution is to turn off the firewall completely and the right solution to add appropriate iptables rules .
Turn off firewall on Redhat like systems :
The easiest solution is to just turn off the firewall .
This will automatically grant access to the nfs daemon to anyone .
I would suggest this solution only for testing purposes of your NFS configuration .
Enter the following linux command to stop firewall and clean up all iptables rules :
# service iptables stop
Now when your NFS settings are correct you should be able to mount nfs filesystem from you client machine .
Add iptables rules to allow NFS communication
This is a more complex but right solution to the above problem .
First we need to set static port for nfs services such as rquotad , mountd , statd , and lockd by editing / etc / sysconfig / nfs file .
Add or uncomment following lines in your / etc / sysconfig / nfs file :
LOCKD_TCPPORT=32803
LOCKD_UDPPORT=32769
MOUNTD_PORT=892
STATD_PORT=662
Restart you NFSD daemon with following linux commands :
# /etc/init.d/nfs restart
# /etc/init.d/nfslock restart
Use rpcinfo command to confirm a validity of your new ports settings :

COMMIT
Apply new rules with iptables - restore , where the single argument will be an iptables - nfs - rules .
txt file :
NOTE : this will create a new set of iptables rules .
If you have already defined some iptables rules previously , you may want to edit iptables - rules - orig. txt and use it with iptables - restore command instead .
# iptables - restore iptables - nfs-rules.txt
Save these new rules , so you do not have to apply new rules for nfs daemon next time you restart your server :
# service iptables save
Now your server is ready to accept client nfs requests .
Optionally , you may restart iptables rules / firewall with the following linux command :
# service iptables restart

A new satellite image appears to have captured China ’s new ballistic missile submarine .
Coordinates : 38°49’4.40 ″ N , 121°29 ’39.82″ E .
A commercial satellite image appears to have captured China ’s new nuclear ballistic missile submarine .
The new class , known as the Jin-class or Type 094 , is expected to replace the unsuccessful Xia-class ( Type 092 ) of a single boat built in the early 1980s .
The new submarine was photographed by the commercial Quickbird satellite in late 2006 and the image is freely available on the Google Earth web site .
A Comparison of SSBN Dimensions
Two satellite images are now available ( see figure below ) that clearly show two missile submarines with different dimensions .
One image from 2005 shows what is believed to be the Xia-class ( Type 092 ) SSBN in drydock at the Jianggezhuang Submarine Base approximately 14 miles east of Qingdao .
The submarine is approximately 390 feet ( 120 meters ) long of which the missile compartment makes up roughly 80 feet ( 25 meters ) .
Twelve missile launch tubes are clearly visible .
The second image from late 2006 shows what appears to be the new Jin-class ( Type 094 ) SSBN moored at the Xiaopingdao Submarine Base south of Dalian , approximately 193 miles north of Qingdao .
The Jin-class appears to be approximately 35 feet ( 10 meters ) longer than the Xia-class SSBN , primarily due to an extended mid-section of approximately 115 feet ( 35 meters ) that houses the missile launch tubes and part of the reactor compartment .
Xia - and Jin-Class SSBN Comparison
These two commercial satellite images of the old Xia-class SSBN ( top ) and the new Jin-class SSBN show the different major compartments .
The Jin-class appears to be approximately 35 feet ( 10 meters ) longer with an extended missile compartment .
Both images view the submarines from a “ eye- altitude ” of approximately 500 feet ( 152 meters ) .
The extended missile compartment of the Jin-class seems seems intended to accommodate the Julang - 2 sea-launched ballistic missile , which is larger than the Julang - 1 deployed on the Xia-class .
Part of the extension may also be related to the size of the reactor compartment .
The U.S. Office of Naval Intelligence estimated in 2004 that the Jin-class , like the Xia-class , will have 12 missiles launch tubes ( see figure below ) .
Other non-governmental sources frequently claim the submarine will have 16 tubes .
The satellite image is not of high enough resolution to show the hatches to the missile launch tubes .
Estimated Jin-Class SSBN Layout The U.S. Office of Naval Intelligence estimated in 2004 ( bottom ) that the Jin-class SSBN would have 12 missiles .
The U.S. Office of Naval Intelligence estimated in December 2006 that China might build five Jin-class SSBNs .
The estimate has been widely cited by non-governmental institutes and some news media as a fact , but the Pentagon ’s annual report on China ’s military forces from May 2007 did not repeat the estimate .
Background : Chinese Nuclear Forces and US Nuclear War Planning | Pentagon Report Ignores Five SSBN Projection
Replication stress , defined as the harmful effects of partially replicated DNA persisting in the nucleus , has a negative impact on the chronological lifespan of yeast , according to a recently published study by Weinberger et al . .
The authors propose that a variety of life - extension techniques ( including calorie restriction ) might benefit cells primarily by preventing them from attempting to synthesize DNA , causing cell - cycle arrest in G1 ( when the nuclear DNA is well - ordered and intact ) as opposed to S ( at which point an arrest results in stalled replication forks and other lesions that will likely be deleterious if they persist ) .
Chronological lifespan is distinct from replicative lifespan — the former is the time a yeast cell can persist in a nutrient - limited environment , the latter is the number of times a given mother cell can bud .
Still , I ca n’t help but be reminded of recent observations by d’Adda di Fagagna and co-workers that DNA hyper - replication in response to oncogenic stimulation ( which also results in stalled replication forks and other structural abnormalities in the DNA ) has a baleful influence on the replicative lifespan of mammalian cells in culture .
Granted that yeast have no reason to senesce ( do they ? ) , the similarities in these two stories suggest a conserved mechanism by which DNA damage ( even if self - induced ) can limit longevity .
The Weinberger study is at PLoS ONE , by the way , if you ’d like to add your own commentary / annotation at the online version of the article .
OSCON Oracle 's assault on Linux looks to take the shape of a fork in the near future , according to Canonical founder and Ubuntu chief Mark Shuttleworth .
" They must be on track to fork soon , " he told us , during an interview here at OSCON .
" They are hiring too many people just to deliver patches .
My assumption is that they are on track to fork and build their own distribution . "
Thus far , Oracle 's dalliance with Linux has centered on providing lower - cost support services for Red Hat Enterprise Linux .
So , you will find an OS called Oracle Enterprise Linux , although this is really just a version of the open source operating system that Oracle tries to keep as up - to - date as possible with Red Hat Enterprise Linux .
Or , as they company says in an FAQ , " Oracle will track the Red Hat distribution closely to ensure compatibility for users . "
Shuttleworth , however , sees Oracle gearing up for its own , full - fledged version of Linux that would compete with software from Red Hat , Novell and others .
Under such a plan , Oracle would very likely keep its Red Hat compatibility in place , while working to grab hold of new accounts with Ego Linux , as it will surely be known .
" I think it would be great , " Shuttleworth said .
And we happen to agree , given that Novell seems a rather ineffectual competitor against Red Hat .
Shuttleworth came to Portland for a number of other reasons than to speculate on Oracle 's plans .
Namely , he led the Ubuntu Live conference held in conjunction with OSCON .
Umbongo Updates
Canonical , the company behind Ubuntu , highlighted a pair of packages during its gig .
First off , customers with a support contract will find Landscape – a web - based systems management tool .
The software does what you might expect , delivering notices of security and tool updates as soon as they go live .
Customers can then choose whether to send those updates to specific machines or to groups of boxes .
You also get reports on what new software has been installed and on the makeup of hardware running Ubuntu in a given network .
Then there 's the Launchpad Personal Package Archive ( PPA ) .
" Individuals and teams can each have a PPA , allowing groups to collaborate on sets of packages , and solo developers to publish their own versions of popular free software , " Canonical said .
" Developers upload packages to a PPA and have it built for multiple architectures against the current version of Ubuntu .
Each user gets up to one gigabyte of Personal Package Archive space , which works as a standard Ubuntu software package repository .
Free PPAs are available only for free ( ' libre ' ) software packages . "
At present , PPA is only available in beta .
You can register for the software here or wait for its release in late August .
Lastly , we saw an early glimpse of the Compiz graphics software that will ship as a default feature in the " Gutsy " release of Ubuntu in October .
The Compiz software looks to give Ubuntu all the razzle - dazzle present in Mac OS X and Vista .
And now back to Shuttleworth .
Think of a number ( and do n't forget it ) .
Double it .
Add six .
Divide your answer by two .
Now take away the number you first thought of .
The number in your head is now ... three !
Magic ?
Well , it is to an eight year old .
Until you understand the basics of functions and algebra , the thought that a number can be predicted is a surprising one .
And of course " magic " and " being surprised " are often the same thing .
Pulling a rabbit out of a hat is magic because it goes against what we expect , and also because we can't explain how it has been done .
Let 's look at another example of mathematical magic .
This trick is going to make a number you choose appear six times ( to get the best effect it helps if you have a calculator ) .
Think of a number between 1 and 9 .
Now multiply it by 7 , then by 3 , next by 11 , then by 37 , and finally by 13 .
If you have n't seen it before , the result will surprise you and make you smile .
And even adults have been know to regard this as a magic trick ( especially when it 's dressed up with a bit of appropriate patter ) .
Like all tricks , it has a perfectly logical explanation .
The numbers 3 , 7 , 11 , 13 and 37 are the prime factors of 111,111 .
Why does it appear magical ?
Because we like pretty patterns , and our experience tells us that multiplying lots of familiar " boring " numbers does n't normally produce something pretty .
Incidentally , numbers that are made up entirely of ones are known by mathematicians as " repunits " , and repunits have many interesting properties .
For example , 1112=12321 .
Half of all repunits are exactly divisible by 11 , and the other half when divided by 11 give a remainder of 1 .
( Actually that result is pretty obvious when you think about it . )
Because of its everyday factors , I find the six digit repunit the most interesting one of all .
Maths and magic have been partners for a long time .
Back in the days of Pythagoras , numbers were connected more with mysticism than with conjuring , but discoveries like the " 3 , 4 , 5 " triangle were enough to make people believe that some numbers must have magical powers .
In the 19th century , Lewis Carroll ( a.k.a. Charles Dodgson , a maths lecturer at Oxford ) was fascinated by all sorts of tricks and puzzles to do with numbers , some of which magicians still use today .
And in modern times , the maths populariser Martin Gardner is one of many mathematicians who are also practising conjurers .
All of these mathemagicians trade off the fact that you can usually predict precisely the outcome of doing something in mathematics , but only if you know the secret beforehand .
And since so few people know the secrets of maths , it provides rich possibilities for mind - reading and other " miraculous " deeds .
One of the most ancient of mathematical curiosities is the so - called magic square .
This one was known to the ancient Chinese , among others :
8 1 6 3 5 7 4 9 2
This square has the interesting property that every row and diagonal add up to 15 , and although you can change it by rotating or reflecting it , the basic arrangement is unique .
Unfortunately it is too well known to rate as a good bit of magic , but there are variants which are less well known and therefore more magical .
For example , I like this simple square :
11 66 98 89 99 88 16 61 86 91 69 18 68 19 81 96
In the square , every row , column and diagonal adds to 264 .
If you study it a bit more closely you should be able to see the simple principle behind it .
However , what makes it particularly magical is that if you turn the square upside down , it becomes what appears to be a different magic square , but with the same magic total .
( In fact all of the numbers on the original square are simply mapped onto new positions in the inverted square , though it takes a while to figure out what the rule is for which goes where . )
Would n't it be remarkable if a magic square could remain magic not only when upside down but also when viewed in a mirror ?
Astonishingly , there is one such square .
It has digits which when rotated and reflected still stay as legitimate digits .
To achieve this , the numbers have to be written in the style of those found on a calculator display .
This multi-symmetrical magic square is four - by - four like the one above , with an identical pattern but with some of the digits changed .
I 'm not going to reveal it , because part of the magic is discovering it for yourself .
I started with an example of a think - of - a- number trick which a child regards as magic but an adult normally regards as a " so what ? " .
Curiously , it can sometimes work the other way around .
Adults can be surprised by things that children regard as unexceptional .
Here is an example .
Let 's suppose that the world is a perfect sphere and you have tied a piece of string tightly around it , so tightly that you can't even squeeze a razor blade underneath .
Now cut the string and add in an extra metre to it .
Compared to the enormous length of string around the earth , you have only inserted a tiny bit of slack .
So the question is , how much slack is there ?
If millions of people spread out all along the string now tried to lift up the string at the same time , would there be enough slack for them all to squeeze a razor blade underneath ?
Could they possibly even get their fingers under it ?
An adult 's intuition usually says that even the razor blades would struggle to get through .
Which makes the real answer gobsmacking .
It turns out that around the earth there would now be enough slack to let millions of rabbits get under the string without even having to squeeze .
The answer is so surprising ( if you have n't heard it before ) that it seems impossible - or magical , depending on your point of view .
To work out why it is true , you just need some simple algebra .
Let ’s call the diameter of the earth , so its circumference is .
We add in a metre of string , to make the new circumference , where is the extra diameter ( or slack ) in the string .
But we know that , so .
Cancel out the to give , or , which is roughly 32 cm .
So the extra diameter is about 32 cm , meaning the extra radius is 16 cm .
In other words , the circle of string will now clear the earth by 16cm all the way round .
That ’s more than enough space for the all rabbits to crawl through .
But young children do n't have the same reaction to this " trick " , mainly because their sense of the " right " sort of answer to expect is not well enough developed .
In fact to them it would be disappointing if the rabbits could n't squeeze under the string !
It reminds me of a story told in the book Sophie 's World .
Mum , Dad and two year old Thomas are at breakfast .
Suddenly , Dad flies up and floats around the ceiling .
Thomas smiles as he points and says " Look , Daddy 's flying " .
Mum screams and drops the jam .
This simple example demonstrates something that happens throughout the world of maths .
Something is only magic if it goes against what your experience tells you to expect .
What the two - year - old Thomas saw was exciting , but no more magical than countless other new experiences he saw every day ( like the fact that when you drop a bottle it smashes into hundreds of pieces ) , whereas what his mother saw went against everything she thought she knew .
In the same way , many maths tricks are only surprising to mathematicians who have spent years encountering results that have led them to expect something else .
That 's why sometimes clever people can be the easiest to fool .
So magical maths is n't just limited to the minds of primary school children .
However far you go in the exploration of this subject , you can be certain that there will be things around the corner waiting to surprise you .

Soldier ordered to pay back signing bonus after being injured in Iraq Mike Aivaz and Nick Juliano
Published : Wednesday November 21 , 2007

Pentagon rescinds repayment order right before soldier 's TV appearance
As the military struggles to fill its ranks after six years of war it is finding cold - hard cash to be a powerful enticement .
But for one soldier who was injured serving his country in its wars , the military had another demand : pay us back .
Jordan
Fox was seriously injured by a roadside bomb earlier this year , and the Army asked him to repay $ 3,000 of the $ 10,000 enlistment bonus he received .
" It was kind of like a slap in the face to know that I had done my best and tried to serve my country with honor and have them turn around and say , ' Well you owe us money , ' " Fox said on MSNBC's Live with Dan Abrams Tuesday .
Perhaps realizing the wave of bad publicity that would result from Fox 's nationally televised appearance , the Pentagon reversed course just before the program aired and vowed not to send its debt collectors after the wounded soldier .
Fox is not alone , though .
According to KDKA , a local station in Pittsburgh , Pa. , the military " is demanding that thousands of wounded service personnel give back signing bonuses " after being injured in combat .
Since the US invasion of Iraq in 2003 , more than 28,000 troops have been injured and nearly 4,000 have died , according to GlobalSecurity.org .
Fox said his parents were offended by the military 's now - rescinded demand for re-compensation .
They started a nonprofit , Operation Pittsburgh Pride , which has sent more than 4,000 care packages to US troops serving in combat .
Fox 's mother , Susan Wardezak , met with President Bush when he visited Pittsburgh last year .
Because his injuries -- a serious back problem and the loss of vision in his right eye -- shattered Fox 's dream of becoming a police officer , his future is unclear .
But the veteran says he has no regrets about joining the Army .
" I 'd do it all over again ... because I 'm proud of the discipline that I learned .
I 'm proud to have done something for my country , " he told KDKA .
The following video is from MSNBC's Abrams Report , broadcast on November 20 , 2007 Clinton : Reverse ' outrageous ' policy
The frontrunning Democratic presidential candidate wrote the Army secretary on Wednesday to call for an end to the Pentagon 's " outrageous " repayment policy , according to a press release received by RAW STORY .
" I write to request the immediate reversal of an Army policy that requires repayment of enlistment bonuses by medically discharged wounded soldiers .
According to recent media reports , the Army is directing wounded soldiers who have been medically discharged to repay their enlistment bonuses because they are unable to complete their term of enlistment , " Sen. Clinton ( D - NY ) wrote Secretary of the Army Pete Geren .
" This policy is outrageous and should be reversed immediately . "
Clinton continued , " Soldiers who have enlisted in the Army have made a commitment to serve our nation .
With our nation at war in Iraq and Afghanistan , we should honor those who make that commitment .
By agreeing to serve and then suffering wounds during their service , these soldiers have earned their bonuses .
To ask soldiers who are being medically discharged to return their bonuses dishonors their service and undermines the Army 's stated commitment to soldiers and their families . "
Clinton referred to other woes experienced by veterans in the recent past , ever since the 2003 invasion of Iraq .
" Since the beginning of the war in Iraq , wounded soldiers have faced numerous bureaucratic hurdles that have resulted in treatment that does not measure up to their service and sacrifice , " Clinton wrote .
" Whether it is the disgraceful treatment as outpatients at Walter Reed Army Medical center or the pay problems experienced by wounded soldiers , many wounded soldiers have been treated with indifference and neglect . "
Clinton continued , " As a Senator on the Armed Services Committee , I have continuously raised the problems faced by wounded soldiers to Army leadership at hearings , meetings , through correspondence and by offering legislation .
At each point , I have been assured by the Army and Defense Department leadership that they are working to improve the treatment of wounded soldiers .
In light of this history , it shocks the conscience that the Army could demand that wounded soldiers return their enlistment bonuses . "
" Therefore , I again request a reversal of the flawed policy of requiring wounded soldiers to repay their enlistment bonuses , " Clinton added .
" I also request any data that reflects the total number of medically discharged wounded soldiers who have been affected by this enlistment bonus repayment policy to date and the total amount of enlistment bonus repayment money collected to date . "
Clinton vowed , " If the Administration does not reverse this misguided policy , Congress should pass legislation to set this right . "
The press release further noted that " Senator Clinton announced that she will introduce legislation that requires the military services to continue to pay certain bonuses to a member of the Armed Forces who is medically retired or separated due to a combat - related injury .
The legislation would amend Title 37 of the United States Code to guarantee full payment for various incentive payments for wounded servicemembers . "
Gas War Turns Deadly in Detroit A feud between owners over gas prices in Detroit ends with one man dead .
Nov. 16 , 2007  --
A simmering feud over prices between neighboring gas station owners in Detroit turned fatal this morning as one man shot and killed the other during a confrontation outside one of the stations , police said .
Police originally responded to a call about an assault in progress with a bat and a pipe outside a local Marathon gas station , Sgt. Eren Stephens Bell , a spokeswoman for the Detroit police , told ABC News .
When officers arrived on the scene , they found that one station owner had been shot .
He was transported to a local hospital , but was pronounced dead on arrival , Bell said .
" The shooter is in police custody , " Bell said , adding that charges had not yet been filed against the alleged gunman and that the investigation was ongoing .
Police did n't release the names of either of the gas station owners .
ABC News '
Detroit affiliate WXYZ reported that this morning 's confrontation began as two employees of a Marathon station were manually changing the gas prices on the station 's board to $ 2.93 for a gallon of regular unleaded gasoline -- 3 cents a gallon less than the competing BP gas station next door .
As the two Marathon employees , including the station 's 51 - year - old owner , made the change , they were approached by two workers from the BP .
One of those men was the competing station 's 45 - year - old owner , reportedly a father of five .
Someone brandished a bat , according to the WXYZ report , before the owner went inside the Marathon shop , retrieved a gun and shot the BP owner multiple times .
As police investigated the crime scene , BP then raised its price for a regular gallon of unleaded gas from $ 2.96 to $ 3.09 .
Witnesses told WXYZ that the two owners had been involved in an ongoing price war to compete for business as the cost of gasoline has continued to rise .
Bret Hart has kind , sad eyes , a gentle handshake and an overall mien of melancholy .
The long , dark hair that used to whip around his face in the wrestling ring is grey and pony - tailed .
His face looks like the face of someone who 's lived a hard and strange life and , after reading his just - published autobiography , Hitman : My Real Life in the Cartoon World of Wrestling , you know it 's a face he 's earned many times over .
A hard - scrabble childhood in a wrestling family with 11 siblings , the ups and downs of being a WWF superstar , a tempestuous marriage , his brother Owen 's death in the ring when he fell 24 metres in a stunt gone terribly wrong , a stroke , the deaths – many due to drugs , booze , steroids – of many wrestling colleagues and friends ( Chris Benoit being the latest ) and deep family quarrels are all described in detail in the massive tome .
" There were quite a few difficult parts to write .
To write about when my brother Owen died was really hard .
When I started writing that , it was tough , and when I was done , I was just exhausted mentally and weary of the whole project .
It was tough to relive , " says Hart , now 50 , sitting in his publisher 's office .
" And the stroke , to write about how miserable I felt and how broken I was , it brings it all back .
In a good and a bad way .
You think about all the bad but also that it 's over with .
You never forget it ...
It is the biggest thing I 've ever fought .
When I think of where I was when I was in the hospital and could n't turn my hand over and was so devastated by the whole thing .
" But I escaped it all .
The bad fate that was set in motion for me . "
Does escaping that fate , where so many others perished , bring about survivor 's guilt ?
" No , no , you can't fall into that .
You have to live strong , enjoy every day , " he says .
" You have to enjoy it all because you never know what 's going to happen .
My brother Owen was the kind of guy who was always telling himself that tomorrow he would finally get home , everything was for that plan down the road .
I feel bad sometimes when I think of all the friends that have died .
Many of them , including Owen , should be here .
Horrible things can happen , but I do n't know what Owen was thinking when he did that stunt . "
Professional wrestling is storytelling taken to the nth and violent degree , with heroes and heels and elaborate soap opera - like narratives .
Hart was a good storyteller in the ring and moving on to the written word is a natural progression .
" In a lot of ways , it 's the same thing .
In my case you try to tell the truth , bring out the best and try to find the point .
I 'm not sure what the point is in my book ... maybe that no one is perfect and that you should watch out for everything that comes , good or bad .
I think I was really good at telling wrestling stories .
I really understood the psychology of wrestling and had a gift for being able to see it in my head before everyone else .
In wrestling there is no rehearsal , you show up and even if you do n't know the guy you 're wrestling with you have to piece a story together ... very few wrestlers ever questioned me on my storytelling when I structured a match . "
" I can remember with Vince McMahon , I started to tell him what I was doing and he'd stop me and say ` Do n't tell me , I just want to watch . ' "
McMahon , of course , is the owner of what was the WWF during Hart 's wrestling days and is now the WWE , having annexed other organizations .
Hitman , in stores now , chronicles Hart 's adversarial relationship with McMahon , a feud that caused Hart to leave the WWF under unpleasant circumstances .
The two are now back on speaking terms and Hart is n't too worried that the book will upset McMahon , whom he refers to as " ultimately the biggest wrestling fan of all . "
Hart does n't want to revive any quarrel with McMahon as " he has many ways he can stick a thumb in my eye .
There 's not much I can do to him .
Maybe this book is my best and only shot to say what needs to be said and clear the air . "
McMahon is n't the only one who is portrayed with a whole lot of warts .
" For the most part , I thought I 'm going to write what 's necessary .
If I hurt a few feelings here and there , as long as I 'm not malicious – unless I 'm intending to be malicious – I did n't go out of my way to run anybody over .
And if anybody got run over that 's because it was necessary to the story . "
Hart is ready to take some time off once the book tour is over – " just take it easy . "
And then what with the rest of his life ?
Where does an old wrestler go ?
" I do n't know .
I may go back to film school here in Toronto .
I talked to Paul Jay who did the Wrestling with Shadows documentary and we talked about hiring me on to learn the film business . "
One thing he's not going to be doing is helping his kids get into the family business .
His two sons are n't interested , something Hart seems relieved about .
Asked if he 's happy , in spite of the losses , in spite of the close brush with that bad fate , in spite of there being problems with his second , and long - distance , marriage , there 's a smile .
" I think so .
I think I am .
I 've been through a lot ... but , I 'm happy with the book coming out .
I 'm happy with my life in general , my health .
The Calgary Hitmen ( WHL hockey club ) are rated No. 1 in the country .

Here 's the EPA 's list of major environmental legislation .
The Freedom of Information Act of 1966
National Environmental Policy Act of 1969
The Clean Air Act of 1970
The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970
Federal Insecticide , Fungicide and Rodenticide Act of 1972
The Endangered Species Act of 1973
The Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974
The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976
The Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976
The Clean Water Act of 1977
Comprehensive Environmental Response Act of 1980
The Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986
The Emergency Planning & Community Right - To - Know Act of 1986
The Oil Pollution Act of 1990
The Pollution Prevention Act of 1990
Food Quality Protection Act of 1996
Chemical Safety Information Act of 1999
Notice anything funny about this list ?
It starts out with a bang .
Clean Air , Endangered Species , and Clean Water all come in the space of seven years .
Then the pace kind of ... slows .
In particular , you might notice that the last eight years are empty of environmental accomplishments .
Why ?
You do n't have to look any further than the White House , now occupied by a man who announced during his first congressional run that he wanted to eliminate both the EPA and OSHA .
He was aided by a Republican congress that failed to send him any significant bills , and which colluded with administration efforts to weaken existing laws .
Now is our chance to change this .
The Clean Water Protection
Act is only a few lines long , but by removing ambiguity around the idea of " fill material " it closes a loophole that mining companies have been exploiting for the last three decades .
Here 's how Appalachian Voices ( where kossack faithfull works in support of this legislation ) puts it .
The Clean Water Protection
Act reestablishes the original intent of the Clean Water Act : to protect our waterways , not give industry permission to pollute and bury them .
With the Bush administration about to weaken the existing Stream Buffer Zone Rule ( you can comment on the proposed changes here ) , the CWPA is our best chance to save the mountains .
The Act has 103 cosponsors , but it needs more if it 's going to get out of committee , onto the floor , and passed .
If your representative is already on the list , thank them and let them know this issue is important to you .
If not , it 's even more important that you contact them and tell them to sign on .
Immediately .
Here are three more states ' worth of Democratic representatives who have not yet signed on as cosponsors .
Among this group , John Salazar and Grace Napolitano both deserve special attention today , as they 're part of the subcommittee where the bill is currently trapped .
Tell them you want their support , and you want this bill moving .
Ask them to support the Clean Water Protection Act
Check after the break for a list of kossack rock stars who took time out to contact their representatives yesterday !

These cheerful yellow and white harbingers of spring , aka daffodils and jonquils , are actually mildly toxic if the bulbs are eaten in large quantities ( Narcissus pseudonarcissus is shown ) .
Some people confuse them for onions .
Daffodil bulb diners tend to experience nausea , vomiting , cramps and diarrhea .
A doctor might recommend intravenous hydration and / or drugs to stave off nausea and vomiting if symptoms are severe or the patient is a child .
9.Rhododendron
8.Ficus
Rhododendrons and azalea bushes ( a variety of rhododendron ) , with their bell - shaped flowers , look great in the yard come springtime , but the leaves are toxic and so is honey made from the flower nectar .
Eating either from these evergreen shrubs makes your mouth burn , and then you 'll probably experienced increased salivation , vomiting , diarrhea and a tingling sensation in the skin .
Headaches , weak muscles and dim vision could follow .
Your heart rate could slow down or beat strangely , and you might even drop into a coma and undergo fatal convulsions .
Before that , doctors will try to replace your fluids and help you breath more easily and administer drugs to bring back your normal heart rhythm
Also known as weeping fig , benjamin tree , or small - leaved
rubber plants , all ficus have milky sap in their leaves and stems that is toxic .
There are about 800 species of ficus trees , shrubs and vines ( Ficus benjamina is shown ) , many of which are cultivated indoors in pots and tubs and outdoors in warm areas where some varieties can grow to up to 75 feet tall .
The worst that will happen is your skin will itch and puff up and your doctor will give you something for the allergy or the inflammation .
7.Oleander
Every bit of the oleander plant is toxic , unlike the case for
other plants where just the flower or sap might be poisonous .
Even accidental inhalation of the smoke from burning oleander is a problem .
Other trouble comes from using the sticks for weenie or marshmallow roasts or drinking water in which the clusters of red , pink or white flowers have been placed .
These evergreen shrubs ( Nerium oleander is shown ) are common as tub plants or in gardens in the Southwest and California , any locale that approaches the plant 's native Mediterranean climate .
Typically the symptoms involve a change in heart rate , be it a slow down or palpitations or high potassium levels .
A doctor might prescribe a drug to bring your heartbeat back under control and try to induce vomiting with ipecac , pump your stomach or absorb the toxin with ingested charcoal .
6.Chrysanthemum
Also known as mums , orange and yellow varieties of these showy flowers often turn up in foil - wrapped pots on people 's front steps around Halloween and Thanksgiving .
There are 100 to 200 species of Chrysanthemums , and they generally grow low to the ground , but can turn into shrubs .
Gardeners plant mums to keep rabbits away .
Guess what ?
The flower heads are somewhat toxic to humans too .
But not terribly .
Touching them can make you itch and puff up a bit , but probably the doctor will just give you something for the inflammation and allergic reaction .
5.Anthurium
The leaves and stems of these bizarre - looking plants , with dark green , heart - shaped leathery leaves and a scarlet ,
white or green spike surrounded by a red , pink or white " spathe , " are toxic .
Also known as flamingo flowers or pigtail plants , eating tropical Anthuriums could give you a painful burning sensation in the mouth that then swells and
blisters .
Your voice might also become hoarse and strained and you might have difficulty swallowing .
Most of this will fade with time , but cool liquids , pain pills and gluey herbs and foods like licorice or flaxseeds may bring relief .
4. Lily - of - the - valley
These darling droopers , also known as mayflowers , are entirely poisonous , from the tips of their tiny bell - shaped white flowers that coyly fall off like parted hair to the very water in which they might be placed .
A little bit of Lily - of - the - valley ( Convallaria majalis ) probably wo n't hurt much , but if you eat a lot , you 'll probably experience
nausea , vomiting , pain in the mouth , abdominal pain ,
diarrhea and cramps .
Your heart rate might also become slow or irregular .
A doctor might decide to clean out your stomach by pumping it or feeding you absorbing charcoal , and might give you drugs to bring your heart rate back to normal .
3.Hydrangea
These poofy - flowered bushes ( Hydrangea macrophylla ) are popular yard ornaments that can grow up to 15 feet tall with rose , deep blue or greenish - white flowers that grow in huge clusters and look as edible as cotton candy or a big bun to an imaginative mind .
But those blooms will give you a belly ache that sets in sometimes hours after eaten .
Typically , patients also experience itchy skin , vomiting , weakness and sweating .
Some reports indicate that patients can even experience coma , convulsions and a
breakdown in the body 's blood circulation .
Luckily , there is an antidote for hydrangea poisoning , and doctors might also give you drugs to address to ease your symptoms .
2.Foxglove
Foxglove is a magical looking plant that grows to 3 feet tall with drooping purple , pink or white flowers , sometimes dotted inside , along a central stalk .
Its Latin name is Digitalis purpurea , which might sound familiar ; leaves from the plant are a commercial source of the heart drug digitalis .
If you eat any part of these plants in the wild , you too will likely have heart problems after a spell of nausea , vomiting , cramps , diarrhea and pain in the mouth .
A doctor might administer charcoal to absorb the toxin or pump
your stomach , and might also administer drugs to bring your heart rate back to normal .
Other names for this plant include fairy bells , rabbit flower , throatwort and witches ' thimbles .
1.Wisteria
Wisterias form romantic cascades of sweetpea - like flowers that fall in lush blue , pink or white masses from woody vines that grow mainly in the South and Southwest .
The entire plant , also known as a kidney bean tree , is toxic , though some say the flowers are not .
Better safe than sorry , because most reports are that eating this plant will cause nausea , vomiting , cramps and diarrhea that could require treatments such as intravenous hydration and anti-nausea pills .

People of color experience discrimination at every stage of the criminal justice system .
The drug war has produced profoundly unequal outcomes across racial groups , manifested through racial discrimination by law enforcement and disproportionate drug war misery suffered by communities of color .
Many different communities of color bear the impact of the discriminatory enforcement of drug laws .
This impact may vary across cities and regions .
Nationwide , some of the most egregious racial disparities can be seen in the case of African Americans and Latinos .
Higher arrest and incarceration rates for these communities are not reflective of increased prevalence of drug use , but rather of law enforcement ’s focus on urban areas , lower income communities and communities of color .
Disparities in arrests and incarceration are seen for both drug possession law violations as well as low - level sales .
Those selling small amounts of drugs to support their own drug use may go to jail for decades .
This unequal enforcement ignores the universality of drug dependency , as well as the universal appeal of drugs themselves .

A History of the Racist War on Drugs
We believe that the mass criminalization of people of color , particularly young African Americans , is as profound a system of racial control as the Jim Crow laws were in this country until the mid-1960s .
This video from hip hop legend Shawn “ Jay Z ” Carter and acclaimed artist Molly Crabapple depicts the drug war ’s devastating impact on the Black community from decades of biased law enforcement .
The video traces the drug war from President Nixon to the draconian Rockefeller Drug Laws to the emerging aboveground marijuana market that is poised to make legal millions for wealthy investors doing the same thing that generations of people of color have been arrested and locked up for .
The Facts
The Drug War Drives Racial Disparities in the Criminal Justice System
Misguided drug laws and draconian sentencing have produced profoundly unequal outcomes for communities of color .
People of color experience discrimination at every stage of the criminal justice system and are more likely to be stopped , searched , arrested , convicted , harshly sentenced and saddled with a lifelong criminal record .
This is particularly the case for drug law violations .
Nearly 80 % of people in federal prison and almost 60 % of people in state prison for drug offenses are black or Latino .
Research shows that prosecutors are twice as likely to pursue a mandatory minimum sentence for black people as for white people charged with the same offense .
Among people who received a mandatory minimum sentence in 2011 , 38 % were Latino and 31 % were black .
Black people and Native Americans are more likely to be killed by law enforcement than other racial or ethnic groups .
They are often stereotyped as being violent or addicted to alcohol and other drugs .
Experts believe that stigma and racism may play a major role in police - community interactions .
Other racial groups are also impacted by the drug war , but the disparities with these highlighted groups are particularly stark and well documented .
Learn about how the drug war has affected Latinx communities .
The Fentanyl Era
Despite the recent emergence of fentanyl in the illegal market , lengthy sentences have been on the books for decades .
They have not stopped the spread of fentanyl .
At the federal level , pre-existing penalties range from a five - year mandatory minimum sentence for a first offense to life without parole for a third conviction .
With the majority ( 75 % ) of those currently federally sentenced for fentanyl trafficking being people of color , these laws threaten to only exacerbate racial disparities in the criminal justice system .
See our fentanyl report to learn about health - centered solutions to the overdose crisis .
The Drug War Fuels Widespread Detentions and Deportations
For noncitizens , including legal permanent residents , any drug law violation can trigger automatic detention and deportation – often without the possibility of return .
People deported for drug law violations are sent back to their countries of origin , where they may no longer have any ties to family or community .
They may lack basic survival needs like food , housing and health services , and may face serious threats to their security .
They are usually barred from reentering the United States , often for life .
The result is thousands of families broken and communities torn apart every year .
More than 250,000 people were deported from the United States for drug law violations between 2007 and 2012 .
A 2015 report by Human Rights Watch found that deportations for drug possession offenses increased by 43 % from 2007 to 2012 .
Simple marijuana possession was the fourth most common cause of deportation for any offense in 2013 , and the most common cause of deportation for drug law violations .
More than 13,000 people were deported in 2012 and 2013 just for marijuana possession .
The Drug War Produces Lifelong Collateral Consequences
Punishment for a drug law violation is not only meted out by the criminal justice system , but is also perpetuated by policies denying child custody , voting rights , employment , business loans , licensing , student aid , public housing and other public assistance to people with criminal convictions .
These exclusions create a permanent second - class status for millions of Americans .
Like drug war enforcement itself , they fall disproportionately on people of color .
One in 13 black people of voting age are denied the right to vote because of laws that disenfranchise people with felony convictions .
One in nine black children has an incarcerated parent , compared to one in 28 Latino children and one in 57 white children .
Our Priorities
The Drug Policy Alliance is committed to exposing discrimination and disproportionate drug law enforcement , as well as the systems that perpetuate them .
We work to eliminate policies that result in the unfair criminalization of communities of color by rolling back harsh mandatory minimum sentences and by addressing on the rampant over - policing of these communities .

Doc has an important post today that reflects on data and privacy .
The post comes back to Marc Canter ’s “ but it ’s our daaaaaatttttaaaaaa dudeeeeeeeessss riggggggggghhhhttt ?!?!?!!!!!! ” question that we ’ve been hearing at tech conferences going on three years now .
All of this comes up because Facebook has done three things that are at once extremely innovative , extremely rude , extremely helpful , and extremely disconcerting :
1 . They are collecting and republishing user data on a level not before seen by users .
2 . They are allowing advertisers to use this data to reach these users .
3 . They are not giving this information –information that has put their value at $ 15 billion –back to their users .
Depending on who you are , or what your goals are at a particular time , you might find extreme pleasure or discomfort in each of these .
Let ’s look at some examples .
Marketers vs. Customers
If you ’re making a product that would appeal to folks who play the video Guitar Hero and you want to market it then you have a couple of choices today .
First , you could buy the keyword “ guitar hero ” ( or related ones ) on a search engine like Google .
That ’s very cool , obviously because you know the person ’s intent at that very moment .
Second , you could buy ads on a blog about video games like Joystiq.com .
That ’s cool because you know the demographics of the folks who read that blog are the top 20 % of video game users ( the meme spreaders ) .
Facebook looks at those two systems and says to the marketer “ what if we had a list of folks who opted in to receive information about Guitar Hero ?
Would you be interested in that ? ”
Well , of course you would !
In fact , I did and here is what it looks like :
The ads do n’t perform well on a clickthrough basis because they are one of 100 very compelling clicks that users can pick from on their Facebook page ( i.e. your messages , applications , wall , etc ) .
However , Facebook charges on a per-click basis so it ’s not the marketer ’s issue .
Now , this is not revolutionary as Zuckerberg stated in his fabulous claim that “ every 100 years media changes . ”
Yes Zuck , the printing press and then Facebook are the two milestones to date ( forget about radio , TV , and the internet , as well as “ smaller ” innovations like wikipedia , cable , and blogs ) .
However , what Facebook is doing is less revolution and more the evolution of direct marketing which has moved from offline to optin email lists and on to search advertising ( i.e. Google AdWords ) .
The only problem with Facebook ’s opt - in advertising system is that the users who they are selling to marketers did n’t really opt-in .
What they did do was fill out a profile in which they said they “ liked Guitar Hero , ” not that they “ would like to get Guitar Hero ” advertising .
Subtle difference , but an important one .
Somewhere in the fine print I ’m sure Facebook is letting people know that they are being sliced and diced , but if you ask 1,000 Facebook users if they opted into this list 1,000 would tell you no .
That ’s the real test : user awareness .
Ask yourself :
Did you fill out your profile in order to be sold to marketers ?
In fact , that ’s why we ’re having a problem right now : people feel Facebook collected data under false pretense and that makes people feel REALLY betrayed .
Did Facebook break the law ?
I doubt it , but they certainly screwed up the messaging –which is what they did the last time when they did the big data reveal … which brings us to the second issue .
The user to user data problem .
Users gave their info to Facebook but never thought it would be shared and disseminated so efficiently .
Every day we watch folks set their status from married , to dating , to single , and the other assorted states of couple - ness .
At the start no one knew this information was broadcast to everyone else ’s walls and today probably half the people know this happens .
There is massive power locked up in data and like a time - bomb it takes a deft hand to deal with it .
Facebook stood their ground the last time and made users deal with the issue , and their probably going to do the same this time .
The final issue : getting my information back .
Which brings us to the final issue : why does Facebook make billions off my data and I can’t even have it back ?
Where is the export feature in Facebook ?
How do I export ALL MY DATA to an XML feed or CSV file and shut down my Facebook account ?
If Facebook wanted to solve a lot of their problems they would put an export key on their profile pages that just gave a raw dump of all your data .
Your photos , your friendships , your wall posts , and your messages .
Just like Ning , Yahoo / GMAIL email , and countless other services provide .
Facebook has the best developers in the world building their product .
They add features at a pace like no other company * including * Google .
They could build an export feature in five days–but they wo n’t .
Why ?
Facebook is pushing themselves into a position of being viewed as ungrateful data hogs : amassing tons of information , selling it under false pretense , and not sharing it with the folks who gave it to them .
Not good .
You can get away with this kind of behavior for a short period of time , but not for the long run .
There are just too many folks out there like Doc , Dave Winer , Marc Canter , Robert Scoble , Steve Gillmor , and Leo Laporte out there today who will call you on it .
Again it comes back to bloggers and their influence of the marketplace …
I love it . 🙂
The message from bloggers to Facebook is clear : if you ’re a hog you ’ll be slaughtered .
JUBA , Sudan ( Reuters ) - International wildlife experts have located hundreds of wild elephants on a treeless island in the swamps of south Sudan , where they apparently avoided unchecked hunting during more than 20 years of war .

“ We flew out of a cloud , and there they were .
It was like something out of Jurassic Park , ” said Tom Catterson , working on a U.S. - funded environment program in south Sudan .
Environmentalists are keeping the location of the island in the Sudd area secret to prevent poachers from killing the animals .
Sudan ’s north - south civil war caused massive displacement of animals as well as people into neighboring countries , according to southern environment ministry official Victor Wurda la Tombe .
The conflict ended with a 2005 peace agreement that gave the south semi-autonomous status , but experts say game hunting is still unchecked in a region filled with guns despite a five - year ban on hunting to allow wildlife to replenish .
Environmentalists are only now beginning to discover the extent of the damage on animal populations , and are looking for additional pockets where animals could not be reached by rebels or armed groups looking for meat and export products like tusks .
It is possible there are other herds of elephants -- mostly unheard of in the contemporary south -- hiding out in the Sudd , an area so flat the Nile River breaks up into hundreds of channels and lakes .
“ It ’s not that good a habitat for elephants , but they ’re free of people shooting at them , ” said Catterson on Sunday .
“ You and I would n’t stand a chance in there between the mosquitoes and crocodiles .
And you ’d get lost . ”
Although Sudan is banned from exporting elephant tusks , it is still easy to purchase ivory carvings in Khartoum ’s famous Omdurman market .
The Sudd is also host to a wide variety of fish , birds , amphibians and reptiles .
Two oil companies have been given concession rights by the southern government in areas deep in the Sudd previously undisturbed by seismic testing and exploratory drilling .
Both the ministry and international experts are worried about the potential for damage in the fragile swamp .
“ Because the land is so flat , if you interrupt drainage patterns here you can have a huge impact , ” Catterson said .
Archie - Lee
Hirst died from multiple injuries
Archie - Lee Andrew Hirst was snatched from his seven - year - old aunt 's arms in the yard of the house in Chald Lane , Wakefield , West Yorkshire , on Friday .
He was taken to hospital with serious injuries but died later .
The " seven to 10 stone " dog was shot at the scene by a police marksman .
It was destroyed to ensure the safety of others there , a police spokesman said .
The boy 's family , including his teenage mother , are now receiving support from specially - trained officers , he said .
Without any warning , the dog snatched the baby from the youngster 's arms and carried him into the yard
Det Supt Steve Payne
Det Supt Steve Payne , from West Yorkshire Police , said the boy was staying with his grandparents during the Christmas holidays .
He said : " What we know at this time is that the dog was a family pet , a two - and - a - half year old female rottweiler , which the family had owned for about six months .
" Although the dog lived in the yard of the premises , it had interacted with members of the family including children , and another dog and cat at the house , and had shown no previous signs of any aggression . "
WHAT HAPPENED Archie - Lee is at grandparents '
Wakefield home Aunt , 16 , is looking after him and two sisters , six and seven Seven - year - old takes Archie to kitchen to stroke the dog Dog snatches Archie , takes him into yard and attacks him The seven - year - old goes upstairs to tell the 16 - year - old The 16 - year - old strikes the dog several times but cannot separate it from Archie 1530 GMT : Aunt phones 999 1536 GMT : Paramedics arrive 1539 GMT : Armed police arrive
Dog shot by police marksman Archie - Lee dies in hospital
Mr Payne said one of the boy 's aunts , aged 16 , was caring for him and her two sisters , aged six and seven , in the house .
The 16 - year - old girl was upstairs when the seven - year - old carried the baby outside to stroke the dog .
Mr Payne said : " Without any warning , the dog snatched the baby from the youngster 's arms and carried him into the yard . "
He said the 16 - year - old tried to rescue the baby but was unable to do so , despite striking the dog several times .
Paramedics and police arrived within six minutes following an emergency call to police at 1530 GMT , he said .
The baby was taken to Pinderfields General Infirmary where he was pronounced dead .
Multiple injuries
The boy 's parents were at a nearby property at the time .
A post -mortem examination has shown Archie - Lee died from multiple injuries consistent with a dog attack .
If a dog is confronted with a situation they are not used to , they can react unexpectedly
Chris Window , Rottweiler Club
The death follows the unlawful killing of five - year - old Ellie Lawrenson who was killed by her uncle 's dog in St Helen 's on New Year 's Day 2007 .
The illegal pit bull terrier called Reuben attacked Ellie at the home of her grandmother , Jackie Simpson , who was later found not guilty of manslaughter through gross negligence .
Ellie 's uncle Kiel Simpson , 24 , was jailed for eight weeks at Liverpool Magistrates ' Court in May after admitting owning a dog banned under the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 .
Chris Window , from the Rottweiler Club , said it was very uncommon for attacks of this nature to take place .
But he said young children should never be left alone with any breed of large dog .
" All breeds of dogs are animals .
They do revert to animal instincts .
If a dog is confronted with a situation they are not used to , they can react unexpectedly . "
What is a nerd ?
Mary Bucholtz , a linguist at the University of California , Santa Barbara , has been working on the question for the last 12 years .
She has gone to high schools and colleges , mainly in California , and asked students from different crowds to think about the idea of nerdiness and who among their peers should be considered a nerd ; students have also “ reported ” themselves .
Nerdiness , she has concluded , is largely a matter of racially tinged behavior .
People who are considered nerds tend to act in ways that are , as she puts it , “ hyperwhite . ”
Image Credit ... 20th Centruy Fox / Photofest
While the word “ nerd ” has been used since the 1950s , its origin remains elusive .
Nerds , however , are easy to find everywhere .
Being a nerd has become a widely accepted and even proud identity , and nerds have carved out a comfortable niche in popular culture ; “ nerdcore ” rappers , who wear pocket protectors and write paeans to computer routing devices , are in vogue , and TV networks continue to run shows with titles like “ Beauty and the Geek . ”
As a linguist , Bucholtz understands nerdiness first and foremost as a way of using language .
In a 2001 paper , “ The Whiteness of Nerds : Superstandard English and Racial Markedness , ” and other works , including a book in progress , Bucholtz notes that the “ hegemonic ” “ cool white ” kids use a limited amount of African - American vernacular English ; they may say “ blood ” in lieu of “ friend , ” or drop the “ g ” in “ playing . ”
But the nerds she has interviewed , mostly white kids , punctiliously adhere to Standard English .
They often favor Greco - Latinate words over Germanic ones ( “ it ’s my observation ” instead of “ I think ” ) , a preference that lends an air of scientific detachment .
They ’re aware they speak distinctively , and they use language as a badge of membership in their cliques .
One nerd girl Bucholtz observed performed a typically nerdy feat when asked to discuss “ blood ” as a slang term ; she replied : “ B - L - O - O - D .
The word is blood , ” evoking the format of a spelling bee .
She went on , “ That ’s the stuff which is inside of your veins , ” humorously using a literal definition .
Nerds are not simply victims of the prevailing social codes about what ’s appropriate and what ’s cool ; they actively shape their own identities and put those codes in question .
Though Bucholtz uses the term “ hyperwhite ” to describe nerd language in particular , she claims that the “ symbolic resources of an extreme whiteness ” can be used elsewhere .
After all , “ trends in music , dance , fashion , sports and language in a variety of youth subcultures are often traceable to an African - American source , ” but “ unlike the styles of cool European American students , in nerdiness , African - American culture and language [ do ] not play even a covert role . ”
Certainly , “ hyperwhite ” seems a good word for the sartorial choices of paradigmatic nerds .
While a stereotypical black youth , from the zoot - suit era through the bling years , wears flashy clothes , chosen for their aesthetic value , nerdy clothing is purely practical : pocket protectors , belt sheaths for gadgets , short shorts for excessive heat , etc. Indeed , “ hyperwhite ” works as a description for nearly everything we intuitively associate with nerds , which is why Hollywood has long traded in jokes that try to capitalize on the emotional dissonance of nerds acting black ( Eugene Levy saying , “ You got me straight trippin ’ , boo ” ) and black people being nerds ( the characters Urkel and Carlton in the sitcoms “ Family Matters ” and “ The Fresh Prince of Bel - Air ” ) .
WASHINGTON , Oct. 4 — Senator Larry E. Craig of Idaho , defying the wishes of many in his own Republican Party , said today that he would remain in the Senate through next year despite a court ruling against him in Minnesota , where he sought to rescind his guilty plea stemming from an undercover sex sting .
Shortly after a state judge denied his request to withdraw the August plea admitting to disorderly conduct , Mr. Craig said he had reversed his previously announced decision to leave the Senate if he could not get the plea thrown out and would instead serve out his third term , which expires at the end of 2008 .
He said he would not run for a fourth .
“ When my term has expired , I will retire and not seek re-election , ” said Mr. Craig , who was accused of soliciting sex from an undercover police officer in the bathroom of the Minneapolis - St.
Paul airport in early June .
“ I hope this provides the certainty Idaho needs and deserves . ”
His decision was a major disappointment to Republican leaders , who had hoped Mr. Craig would make good on his initial pledge and spare them from the potential political liability of having a senior lawmaker who has become a national punch line .
Yesterday , Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad went to Columbia University and asked Israel to bomb his country .
At least that ’s how it sounded to me .
Meanwhile , the President of Columbia hurled personal insults at the leader of a soon - to - be - nuclear power and strengthened their reasons for wanting us dead .
I wonder if those guys had tense conversations with their wives later that night .
Wife : “ Mahmoud , you flaming elf turd , did you just give our enemies political cover to annihilate our country ? ”
Amadinejad : “ Okay , so sometimes I say the wrong thing at the wrong time .
Big deal .
How about coming over here and giving me some scarf . ”
And who was the smartest person involved in yesterday ’s events ?
George Bush .
Criticize him all you want , but sometimes even a blind squirrel finds a nut .
He shrugged off the whole controversy about Ahmadinejad ’s visit to Columbia and let the Iranian President shoot himself in the foot .
Well played .
The most entertaining part of Ahmadinejad ’s speech is trying to figure out what the Hell is happening in his tiny bearded skull .
The things he says that sound crazy , stupid , or ignorant can also be interpreted as routine political talk .
In this country , we expect our politicians to say whatever plays well with voters , no matter how preposterous .
You can never be sure what professional liars are thinking .
So here are my best guesses about Ahmadinejad .
1. Ahmadinejad said Iran does n’t have gay people .
There is zero chance he believes that .
He just wanted to change the subject .
I interpret that as acknowledgment that Iran is executing homosexuals .
( I do n’t approve of that , in case you wondered . )
2. Ahmadinejad acknowledged that the holocaust happened , but thinks it is unfair that the holocaust skeptics in Europe are prosecuted whereas skeptics on other issues are not .
I believe that ’s his true opinion now , whether or not he was a holocaust denier in the past .
If he did n’t believe the holocaust happened , he ’d have no reason to stop denying it now while he ’s openly skeptical about the cause of 9 - 11 .
3 . I think Ahmadinejad is genuinely skeptical that Bin Laden accomplished 9 - 11 all by himself .
I do n’t think it ’s crazy to ask whether some dark forces in the U.S. and Israel had the means and the warped motive to help with the logistics , even if only in some small support way .
Ahmadinejad lives in a country whose government was once overthrown by the U.S. , so I can understand him being genuinely skeptical .
And it plays well back home .
4. Ahmadinejad did n’t respond directly to questions about wanting Israel wiped off the map .
But he said Iran is n’t building nuclear weapons and has no need for them .
In other words , he ruled out nuking Israel .
I believe the leadership in Iran is n’t collectively crazy enough to nuke Israel .
And I do n’t think Ahmadinejad knows of any other realistic way to wipe Israel off the map .
It sounds like politics and wishful thinking to me .
5 . I think Ahmadinejad is lying when he says Iran is n’t building nuclear weapons .
They have the means and the motive ( defense ) .
It ’s in their best interest to have nukes , and they always have the option to give them up , and allow inspectors , if America masses troops on the border .
While I think it ’s highly unlikely that Iran would ever nuke Israel , either directly or by proxy , the odds are not zero .
In my opinion , Ahmadinejad ’s speech at Columbia , plus Iran ’s support for Hezbollah give Israel a legitimate reason to attack Iran in self defense .
I think Ahmadinejad knows that , and is taking a calculated risk that any attack on Iran would be limited in nature and cause Israel to lose international support .
Likewise , Ahmadinejad did n't deny Iran is helping Iraqi insurgents kill Americans .
That 's a legitimate reason for the United States to support an attack on Iran .
It 's a separate question as to whether an attack on Iran is in America 's best interest .
I was n’t planning to blog on this topic , but my hit count went through the roof yesterday thanks to the various groups mustering their forces of darkness to misinterpret what I wrote and screech at me .
( Thank you ! )

Researchers from the University of Missouri and Imperial College London have found evidence suggesting why vaccines directed against the virus that causes AIDS and many cancers do not work .
This research is being published in the Dec. 14 edition of The Journal of Biological Chemistry .
In research spanning more than a decade , Gary Clark , associate professor of Obstetrics , Gynecology and Women ’s Health in the MU School of Medicine , and Anne Dell , an investigator at Imperial College London , found that HIV , aggressive cancer cells , H. pylori , and parasitic worms known as schistosomes carry the same carbohydrate sequences as many proteins produced in human sperm .
“ It ’s our major Achilles heel , ” Clark said .
“ Reproduction is required for the survival of our species .
Therefore we are ‘ hard - wired ’ to protect our sperm and eggs as well as our unborn babies from any type of immune response .
Unfortunately , our results suggest that many pathogens and tumor cells also have integrated themselves into this protective system , thus enabling them to resist the human immune response . ”
During the initial stages of life , the body goes through a process where it “ self - identifies , ” determining which cells and proteins belong in the body , so it can detect those that do not .
After this time , anything foreign is deemed as dangerous , unless the immune system is specifically told to ignore those cells and proteins .
This situation arises primarily during reproduction .
When sperm are made , they specifically label their glycoproteins with Lewis carbohydrate sequences , a specific chain of carbohydrates .
When these “ foreign ” sperm enter the female body , the female ’s immune system does not recognize them as foreign probably because of these Lewis sequences .
Similarly , the unborn baby also could be seen as foreign by the mother ’s immune system , but she produces other types of glycoproteins that likely block any type of immune response in the womb .
These events are required for successful human reproduction .
H. pylori is a bacteria known for causing stomach ulcers .
Schistosomes live inside our bodies , resisting many types of immune responses .
Aggressive tumor cells also can defeat the immune system ; this killed more than half a million people in the United States last year .
HIV - infected immune cells cause AIDS .
The common thread is that each carries Lewis sequences .
Clark said this evidence suggests that vaccines are likely ineffective against these diseases because Lewis sequences shut down the specific immune response that enables vaccines to work .
“ If aggressive cancers and pathogens are using the same system of universally recognizable markers to trick the immune system into ‘ thinking ’ they ’re harmless , we need to determine exactly how this interaction works , ” Dell said .
“ This is where we ’re planning to take this research next .
Understanding how these markers work at a basic biological and chemical level could lead to new ways to treat or prevent cancers and these other diseases in the future . ”
“ This work is creating an entirely new way of thinking about how we must combat viruses like HIV and aggressive tumor cells , ” Clark said .
“ We have literally spent billions of dollars developing vaccines for AIDS and cancer .
However , the latest high profile HIV and tumor vaccine trials have been spectacularly unsuccessful , perhaps for some very good reasons .
We must become more clever if we are ever going to solve the problems of cancer and AIDS . ”

First of all , it ’s a really bad situation .
No one wants to see someone get tasered .
Sure , the kid was obnoxious and physically resisting , and to a certain extent , when you physically resist cops you do put yourself in a risky situation .
Ever see photos of Kerry getting arrested in ’ 71 for civil disobedience ?
He and his fellow Vietnam Vets calmly marched off to jail ...
Still , personally speaking , I wish this ended in a number of ways that did n’t involve jolts of electricity .
But , since the University of Florida is now reporting that an officer was injured in all of this , I think we know this was an ugly situation to say the least .
But , I ’m not here to give my own opinions .
You can read any diary for lots of those .
I ’m just going to give you a quick description of what the scene looked like from the stage , give everyone JK ’s official statement , and let you know what JK told me directly about the situation .
OK , here ’s John Kerry ’s official statement :
" In 37 years of public appearances , through wars , protests and highly emotional events , I have never had a dialogue end this way .
I believe I could have handled the situation without interruption , but I do not know what warnings or other exchanges transpired between the young man and the police prior to his barging to the front of the line and their intervention .
I asked the police to allow me to answer the question and was in the process of answering him when he was taken into custody .
I was not aware that a taser was used until after I left the building .
I hope that neither the student nor any of the police were injured .
I regret enormously that a good healthy discussion was interrupted . "
Now , to the narrative as I got it from JK and a couple others who were there ...
First , the preamble to the video ( much of this closely tracks to this diary ) ... there was a long line of people waiting to ask questions , and Meyer was near the back .
He rushed up to the mic , butting up past many , many kids and making a scene .
Apparently he ’d been talking with the police and they were arguing long before Meyer ever got to the mic ( reports from Florida are that they threatened him with arrest already ) .
That ’s why there are police in the video when you first see it .
They tried to remove him before he said anything , but JK intervened , calling them off and saying he ’d answer his question .
Remember , back in 2004 , there was a lot of press about how open the Kerry campaign was to outside questioners and even protesters , especially compared with the hermetically sealed Bush campaign .
JK ’s done thousands of these events , really enjoys them ( he told me once that doing Q& As with regular citizens is the best part of his job ) , and he ’s totally comfortable dealing with disruptive people .
So he made sure to call the U of F police off .
Which , technically , he had no authority to do , since this was a U of F event , not a Kerry event .
They were their police .
Anyway , then Meyer starts to ask his question , and you ’ve all probably seen most of it .
Here ’s the video with the full question :
Part way through , JK asked him for an actual question because there were still others waiting and time was running short .
( Kerry ’d been taking questions for a solid 45 minutes . )
These kinds of events put on by universities are difficult because Senator Kerry wants to get as many questions in as possible , and there are always A LOT of people waiting .
So , the kid kept going , JK was listening respectfully , and then the mic was cut off ( either because whoever was in charge of the mic thought he was just ranting about whatever came to mind or because the U of F folks did n’t like the word " blowjob " ... I have no idea ) , and the police tried to move him away from the mic .
At this point , Kerry keeps trying to answer the kid ’s questions and restore calm .
He told me that at this point he wanted to make sure to maintain calm in the room as much as possible ( these kinds of events can get out of control in a crowd , and he did n’t want that ) , and he told the police he was happy to answer the question .
As he said in the statement and as he told me , he thinks he could ’ve handled the whole thing without interruption .
Unfortunately , things went downhill from there .
Meyer was pulled into the back of the room and the real scuffling began .
From the stage , JK could n’t see what was going on at all ( it was a huge room . )
So he tried to move things forward , giving the question of voting rights the respect it deserves and trying to answer his question .
He had no idea what kind of scuffle was going on , who was doing what to whom , and was as surprised as anyone when the kid started screaming .
He had no idea the kid was tasered until later .
From there , John Kerry made sure to answer some more questions and stayed for quite some time after the event to shake hands , answer questions one - on - one , sign autographs if people wanted them ...
The whole thing just basically ... it was just a bad , bad situation , and as JK said in his statement , he ’s never had anything end like that before .
Meyer was rude to his fellow students , obnoxious , and physically resisting police , but you never , ever want to see anyone get tasered .
Anyway , I just wanted to give y’all the rundown beyond just the official statement .

I was so impressed that I vowed to them and myself to never wear real fur … again . ”
BALTIMORE ( Reuters ) - A jury on Wednesday ordered an anti-gay Kansas church to pay $ 10.9 million in damages to relatives of a U.S. Marine who died in Iraq after church members cheered his death at his funeral .
Fred Phelps Jr. of Topeka , Kansas laughs at counter protestors as he demonstrates against the consecration of Reverend Gene Robinson as the first openly gay bishop of the Episcopal Church , outside the ceremonies in Durham , New Hampshire , November 2 , 2003 .
A jury on Wednesday ordered a Kansas church led by Phelps to pay $ 2.9 million in compensatory damages to relatives of a gay U.S. Marine after church members cheered his death at his funeral .

Church members said Marine Lance Cpl. Matthew Snyder ’s death was God ’s punishment of America for tolerating homosexuality , and they attended his 2006 funeral in Maryland with signs saying “ You ’re going to hell ” and “ God hates you . ”
The federal jury determined the Westboro Baptist Church , based in Topeka , and three of its principals invaded the privacy of the dead man ’s family and inflicted emotional distress .
Albert Snyder , the Marine ’s father , testified that his son was not gay , but the church targeted the military as a symbol of America ’s tolerance of gays .
Matthew Snyder died in combat in Iraq in March 2006 .
The jury awarded Snyder ’s family $ 2.9 million in compensatory damages plus $ 8 million in punitive damages in the first civil suit against the church , which has demonstrated at some 300 military funerals the past two years .
The lawsuit said church Web sites vilified U.S. soldiers , accusing them of being indoctrinated by “ fag propaganda . ”
“ I hope it ’s enough to deter them from doing this to other families .
It was not about the money .
It was about getting them to stop , ” said Snyder , of York , Pennsylvania .
The church , which is unaffiliated with any major denomination , is headed by Rev. Fred Phelps , who has led a campaign against homosexuality for years .
Most of the estimated 70 members of the church belong to his extended family .
“ It will take the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals a few minutes to reverse this silly thing , ” Phelps said .
His daughter and co-defendant , Shirley Phelps - Roper , vowed to continue protesting military funerals and called the court ’s decision a blow against free speech .
Outside court on Wednesday , Phelps and his children waved placards with slogans such as “ Pray for more dead kids ” and “ God hates fag enablers , ” while passing drivers and pedestrians shouted abuse at them .
Defense attorney Jonathan Katz urged jurors not to award punitive damages because the $ 2.9 million in compensatory damages was already three times the defendants ’ net worth .
“ It ’s enough already to bankrupt them and financially destroy them , ” Katz said .
Craig Trebilcock , an attorney for Snyder , said jurors should award sufficient punitive damages to deter Westboro from repeating its actions .
Cosmo helps create the assumption that every move a man makes has an underlying meaning to it .
This assumption has turned female Cosmo into a hacky English teacher , treating men as though they are Melville ’s great white whale , with every motion , action , breath and word taking on a deep symbolic meaning .
Women who read Cosmo increase the fight factor with their significant other by at least 67 % because , now , the way a man holds a fork can be interpreted in terms of his overall feeling on the relationship .
There is a regular feature in Cosmopolitan called , “ Understanding His Baffling Behavior , ” which “ decodes ” various actions of men and explains to women the true meaning of these actions .
Here is a breakdown of the advice Cosmo gave as well as the correct interpretation :
Why do guys always sit with their legs splayed ?
Cosmos reasoning : " Women are taught to keep their legs together as a way of not inviting sex , " says Helen Fisher , PhD , author of The First Sex : The Natural Talents of Women and How They Are Changing the World ( Ballantine , 2000 ) .
" In contrast , a man is saying , ' Come and get it . ' "
My reasoning :
It is a comfort factor , are we supposed to sit there with our legs crossed or tightly put together with our hands placed upon our knees ?
That is n’t comfortable , it has nothing to do with us saying , “ Come and get it . ”
Although , if you want to come over and drop to your knees we would n’t complain ...
I ’m just sayin’ .
Why do guys hardly ever change their sheets ?
Cosmos reasoning : " Men have a weaker sense of smell , and their skin is n't as sensitive as women's , " says Fisher .
" So guys are n't as likely to notice ( until maximum grime has been reached ) that they 're snoozing in stinky sheets . "
My reasoning :
Do you know how much a pain in the ass it is to put that fitted sheet on ?
I do n’t think that I have ever lain in bed and determined that the sheets felt weird , nor have I had a girlfriend that has ever made that remark .
Thanks Cosmo for making me analyze how my sheets feel every time I climb into bed , like I need something else to be paranoid about .
Why do guys assume every guy who 's not one of his oldest friends is a loser ?
Cosmos reasoning :
It goes back to caveman - clan mentality , says Fisher .
Guys do n't want to let anyone they perceive as the enemy into their inner circle .
They see all men they do n't know ( and that includes the geek at Starbucks ) as a threat .
Help him evolve by pointing out that these days , more girlfriends are stolen by best buds than by strangers .
My reasoning :
This question is a perfect example of the bullshit that Cosmo slings around .
Guys do n’t do constant evaluation of other guys , unless we are sizing them up for fighting purposes .
This is a feminine trait , and stating that we think in the same manner is false .
The only time I see another male as a threat relationship - wise is when another man ’s balls are slapping against my girlfriend ’s chin .
At that point the relationship probably can’t be saved -- well , you could join in but that would be kind of um ... gay .
( Not that there 's anything wrong with that . )
Why do guys like women on top ?
Cosmos reasoning : According to our August 2005 sex survey , 53 percent of men prefer this chick - in - charge pose .
" These playful guys are always looking to have a good time , but they still know how to be attentive , " explains Hargrave .
" Pleasing you is a priority , which is why they prefer a position that best allows you to achieve orgasm . "
My reasoning :
You are expecting me to say less work right ?
That does come into play , along with the being able to access the breasts ; it honestly has nothing to do with how it works for you .
In fact , we would rather bring you to orgasm with you not leading the way ; it makes us feel like we have accomplished something .
Sitting there and letting you use us like a chair - mounted dildo detracts from the ego boost .
Why do guys believe they need to win at everything ?
Cosmos reasoning :
It 's no secret that men have a severe need to succeed , and once again biology is to blame .
In the face of competition , a man 's testosterone level soars , making him more willing to take risks , explains Alan Booth , PhD , a professor of sociology at Pennsylvania State University .
And though this overdrive can be annoying , you may not want to discourage it
My reasoning : Wrong again , not everything has a psychological or physiological root to it .
I squarely blame the “ No Fear ” T - Shirt brand for making shirts that say , “ Second Place is the First Loser . ”
That ruined my outlook on sports forever : now I have to win , because nobody wants to be the first loser .
It has nothing to do with the rush and everything to do with the shame .
I think I have clearly pointed out the flawed logic that Cosmopolitan uses .
Now you know what is corrupting the minds of your girlfriend or wife and making them totally unreasonable .
Wait , that could just be the hormones ... nah , it 's the magazine .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - President George W. Bush portrays the U.S. Congress as being asleep at the switch since Democrats took over in January .
The problem , Democrats retort , is that Bush and his fellow Republicans have tried to derail their work at nearly every turn .
Members of the House of Representatives are sworn into office on the first day of the 110th Congress , January 4 , 2007 .

The problem , Democrats retort , is that Bush and his fellow Republicans have tried to derail their work at nearly every turn .

“ He ( Bush ) is impossible and has been for seven years to deal with , ” Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , a Nevada Democrat told reporters on Tuesday .
Throughout this year , Republicans have tried to tag Democrats with having led a “ do - nothing Congress . ”
“ Nothing has been accomplished all year , ” Rep. John Boehner of Ohio , the Republican leader in the House of Representatives , insists .
But as they excoriate their political opponents , Bush and his fellow Republicans in Congress have successfully stopped most major Democratic initiatives this year .
They have staged an unprecedented number of “ filibusters ” in the Senate , where Democrats do not have a big enough majority to end debate and force a substantive vote .
The few times that was n’t the case , Bush used his veto to kill Democrats ’ top priorities , like ending the Iraq war , expanding health care to children from low - income families and expanding stem cell research .
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky argued Republicans just want to have input .
“ We ca n’t seem to get the kind of bipartisan agreement that allows the minority to have some say , ” according to McConnell .
With only a week or two remaining in the first half of 110th Congress that convened in January , there ’s a deflated feeling on Capitol Hill .
Democrats and Republicans complain not enough has been accomplished .
The public seems to agree , with just one in five Americans approving of the job Congress is doing , even worse than the unpopular Bush ’s ratings .
The legislative deadlock might get even worse next year , as election campaigns for Congress and the presidency get into full swing .
As evidence of the partisanship , Congress this week will have to pass a temporary funding bill to keep most of the government running , the third in as many months , because of disagreements over spending priorities .
Ethan Siegal of the Washington Exchange , a private group that tracks Congress , said of Republicans ’ opposition tactics : “ The template for trying to get into power is to make sure the party in charge does n’t have many legislative successes . ”
But even many Republicans think accusations of a “ do - nothing ” Democratic Congress wo n’t be enough for their party to win back their majority status in the November 2008 elections .
PROMISES KEPT ?
Democrats quickly fulfilled many of their 2006 campaign promises , raising the minimum wage for the first time in a decade , implementing stalled recommendations of the commission that investigated the September 11 attacks and trying to stop ethics abuses that plagued Congress during years of Republican leadership .
Republicans blocked many other measures .
A top domestic priority -- reforming U.S. immigration law -- was buried by conservative Republicans in the House .
On foreign affairs , Republicans killed repeated moves to bring combat in Iraq to an end , despite Americans ’ disenchantment with a war now in its fifth year .
Anti-war feeling had been a driving factor behind the Democrats ’ success in last year ’s elections .
Popular legislation to expand stem cell research to help cure diseases such as Parkinson ’s was vetoed by Bush , as was a bill to deliver health care to more children from low - income families .
Bush has veto threats on the bills to fund the government through next September .
He recently told Arkansas business leaders : “ You ’re fixing to see what they call a fiscal showdown in Washington . ”
But despite the bluster , Bush and congressional Democrats are at odds over a relatively tiny slice , about $ 11 billion , of the nearly $ 3 trillion budget .
Negotiations between the two finally have begun , but a compromise -- some war funding coupled with some of the additional domestic spending Democrats want -- was showing signs of souring this week , again amid accusations of Republican sabotage .
There ’s plenty of incentive for a deal though as neither side wants government shutdowns to begin if agencies run out of money this month .
Heather sent us this video from a CNN story which includes interviews with Iraqis who witnessed and survived the Blackwater attack .
This video was done before the story below broke , but the video gives a lot of background and brings perspective to the horrific nature of the attack .

Via CNN :
The Iraqi government will file criminal charges against employees of U.S. security firm Blackwater who are blamed for a gun battle in Baghdad in which civilians were killed , an Iraqi Interior Ministry official said Sunday .
It is unclear how Iraqi courts will attempt to bring the contractors to trial .
A July report from the Congressional Research Service said the Iraqi government has no authority over private security firms contracted by the U.S. government .
The Iraqi government claims that as many as 20 civilians were killed by the private contractors , who were guarding a U.S. diplomatic convoy .
Iraqi officials , who claim the shootings were unprovoked , dispute the U.S. claim that the guards were responding to an attack and said on Saturday they had a videotape that showed the Blackwater guards opened fire without provocation .

The Iraqi government is trying to uphold the law of their sovereign nation , but the president of another country is standing in the way .
They are calling for the U.S. to replace Blackwater with another contractor , but what are the odds of that happening ?
I would like to think the Iraqis would stand up to their occupiers , but history shows us they wo n't get very far .
Scientists are examining whether they can harness the energydriving human sperm to propel nano - scale robots or deliver medicine to targeted sites in the body .
By deconstructing the stages in the biological pathway sperm cellsuse to generate their relentless energy , researchers at the Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine in the United States hope to recreate that process in an artificial device .
Such a device , they say , could be used to help build a delivery system for chemotherapy drugs or antibiotics that would decrease side - effects by allowing medicines to travel directly to the sites where they are needed , and not peripheral areas of the body .
" Our idea is not the final product but rather an energy - delivery system , " said the study 's senior author Alex Travis , Cornell assistant professor of reproductive biology at the College of Veterinary Medicine 's Baker Institute for Animal Health .
Powerful , albeit microscopic , sperm cells use a kind of dual - engine system to generate their energy .
Organelles in a sperm cell 's midsection provide one part of its battery power , while a second process occurring in the long , spindly tail gives it an additional boost .
It is during this second process that ATP - generating enzymes bind to the sheath of a spermatozoa 's tail to give itthat extrazip .
Researchers haveattached three of the 10 enzymes needed to create this glycolytic pathway to nickel ions on a tiny manufactured chip .
Their goal now is to attachthe remaining seven enzymes , in effect creating nano - robots fuelled by sperm power .
" As a proof of principle that this kind of strategy could work , we 've shown that the first two enzymes could be attached to the same chip and act in series , " added Chinatsu Mukai , a postdoctoral associate in Travis 's lab and a co-author .
Researchers presented their findings atthe American Society for Cell Biology 's 47th annual meeting in Washington , D.C. , on Dec. 3 .
Their next step isto attractfunding in order to finish attaching the remaining enzymes .
" We have a provisional patent , so if a company shows interest , we could also work something out with them , " said Travis .
Among the dozens of wrenching accounts to come out of the collapse of the Interstate 35W bridge in Minneapolis , the actions of 20 - year - old Jeremy Hernandez were a bright spot :
Trapped in a tipping school bus with 50 children , he kicked open the back door and began helping them one by one to safety .
Within a day , news outlets across the country were repeating the story of the school bus , along with a sad footnote — that Mr. Hernandez had recently been forced to drop out of an automotive repair program because he could not afford the $ 15,000 tuition .

That has changed .
On Saturday , Mr. Hernandez learned that Dunwoody College of Technology had offered him a full scholarship toward a degree in applied science .
He has also received offers of help from dozens of strangers across the country , said Molly Schwartz , communications director for Pillsbury United Communities , which employed him as a gym coordinator for one of its summer programs .
Oh my gosh …
I stumbled across this website at Craig ’s List .
It ’s run by Rossi superfans , and I think they got a little too carried away :
… which looks super similar to this :
Way back when , the local GOP stirred up all sorts of fake outrage when the WA Dems put a bumper sticker on their website for 5 seconds .
( The sticker , if you do n’t remember , made the allusion that Christians could be hypocrites , which we all know is n’t true . )
And no , I ’m not saying Dino Rossi is a Nazi ( cool your heels , Don ! )
The Iron Cross had a long history before being corrupted by Adolf Hilter .
But if I was a Republican running in a race that ’ll be tough enough already , I ’m not sure I ’d be happy if my fans were putting my name on Nazi-ish iconography .

State sovereignty must be altered in globalized era
In the age of globalization , states should give up some sovereignty to world bodies in order to protect their own interests
By Richard Haass
For 350 years , sovereignty -- the notion that states are the central actors on the world stage and that governments are essentially free to do what they want within their own territory but not within the territory of other states -- has provided the organizing principle of international relations .
The time has come to rethink this notion .
The world 's 190 - plus states now co-exist with a larger number of powerful non-sovereign and at least partly ( and often largely ) independent actors , ranging from corporations to non-governmental organizations ( NGOs ) , from terrorist groups to drug cartels , from regional and global institutions to banks and private equity funds .
The sovereign state is influenced by them ( for better and for worse ) as much as it is able to influence them .
The near monopoly of power once enjoyed by sovereign entities is being eroded .
As a result , new mechanisms are needed for regional and global governance that include actors other than states .
This is not to argue that Microsoft , Amnesty International , or Goldman Sachs be given seats in the UN General Assembly , but it does mean including representatives of such organizations in regional and global deliberations when they have the capacity to affect whether and how regional and global challenges are met .
Less is more
Moreover , states must be prepared to cede some sovereignty to world bodies if the international system is to function .
This is already taking place in the trade realm .
Governments agree to accept the rulings of the WTO because on balance they benefit from an international trading order even if a particular decision requires that they alter a practice that is their sovereign right to carry out .
Some governments are prepared to give up elements of sovereignty to address the threat of global climate change .
Under one such arrangement , the Kyoto Protocol , which runs through 2012 , signatories agree to cap specific emissions .
What is needed now is a successor arrangement in which a larger number of governments , including the US , China , and India , accept emissions limits or adopt common standards because they recognize that they would be worse off if no country did .
All of this suggests that sovereignty must be redefined if states are to cope with globalization .
At its core , globalization entails the increasing volume , velocity , and importance of flows -- within and across borders -- of people , ideas , greenhouse gases , goods , dollars , drugs , viruses , e-mails , weapons and a good deal else , challenging one of sovereignty 's fundamental principles : the ability to control what crosses borders in either direction .
Sovereign states increasingly measure their vulnerability not to one another , but to forces beyond their control .
Globalization thus implies that sovereignty is not only becoming weaker in reality , but that it needs to become weaker .
States would be wise to weaken sovereignty in order to protect themselves , because they cannot insulate themselves from what goes on elsewhere .
Sovereignty is no longer a sanctuary .
This was demonstrated by the American and world reaction to terrorism .
Afghanistan 's Taliban government , which provided access and support to al - Qaeda , was removed from power .
Similarly , the US ' preventive war against an Iraq that ignored the UN and was thought to possess weapons of mass destruction showed that sovereignty no longer provides absolute protection .
Imagine how the world would react if some government were known to be planning to use or transfer a nuclear device or had already done so .
Many would argue -- correctly -- that sovereignty provides no protection for that state .
Necessity may also lead to reducing or even eliminating sovereignty when a government , whether from a lack of capacity or conscious policy , is unable to provide for the basic needs of its citizens .
This reflects not simply scruples , but a view that state failure and genocide can lead to destabilizing refugee flows and create openings for terrorists to take root .
The NATO intervention in Kosovo was an example where a number of governments chose to violate the sovereignty of another government ( Serbia ) to stop ethnic cleansing and genocide .
By contrast , the mass killing in Rwanda a decade ago and now in Darfur , Sudan , demonstrate the high price of judging sovereignty to be supreme and thus doing little to prevent the slaughter of innocents .
Conditions needed
Our notion of sovereignty must therefore be conditional , even contractual , rather than absolute .
If a state fails to live up to its side of the bargain by sponsoring terrorism , either transferring or using weapons of mass destruction , or conducting genocide , then it forfeits the normal benefits of sovereignty and opens itself up to attack , removal or occupation .
The diplomatic challenge for this era is to gain widespread support for principles of state conduct and a procedure for determining remedies when these principles are violated .
The goal should be to redefine sovereignty for the era of globalization , to find a balance between a world of fully sovereign states and an international system of either world government or anarchy .
The basic idea of sovereignty , which still provides a useful constraint on violence between states , needs to be preserved .
But the concept needs to be adapted to a world in which the main challenges to order come from what global forces do to states and what governments do to their citizens rather than from what states do to one another .

A TOWN DIVIDED
The rural community of Dover , Pennsylvania is torn apart in the latest battle over the teaching of evolution , and parents file a lawsuit against the town 's school board in federal court .
WHAT IS EVOLUTION ?
More than 150 years ago Charles Darwin developed the theory of evolution to explain how the diversity of life arose , laying the foundation for modern biological science .
INTRODUCING INTELLIGENT
DESIGN
The Dover School Board attempts to introduce into science classrooms the idea that life is too complex to have evolved naturally and therefore must have been designed by an intelligent agent .
THE TRIAL BEGINS
The court is asked to decide whether the School Board promoted religion or had religious motivation , and whether intelligent design is science .
THE FOSSIL RECORD A 2004 discovery in the arctic of a transitional fossil from fish to land - dwelling animals is the latest substantiation of Darwin 's theory of evolution .
A VERY SUCCESSFUL THEORY
The ongoing scientific quest to investigate the unknown has led to some of the strongest evidence for evolution , including findings in modern genetics and molecular biology .
THE NATURE OF SCIENCE
After experts point out that supernatural causes cannot be tested scientifically , the defense begins its case for intelligent design .
EXAMINING INTELLIGENT DESIGN
In court , biochemist Michael Behe argues that the concept of irreducible complexity is evidence for intelligent design , while biologist Ken Miller points out the weaknesses in that concept .
FAITH AND REASON
As the legal teams battle it out in court , the clash between evolution and intelligent design takes a toll on the Dover community .
SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND STATE
The court looks at evidence that the Dover School Board was motivated by religion .
A CULTURE CONFLICT
Some proponents of intelligent design would like to see the theory permeate our religious , cultural , moral , and political life .
CLOSING ARGUMENTS
After six weeks , the trial concludes with closing arguments that were as divided as Dover itself had become , and Judge Jones renders his unequivocal verdict .
Corporate News Means No Real News
Where Impeachment is Concerned
MEDIA CRITICISM : Corporate News Means No Real News
Where Impeachment is Concerned by Dave Lindorff Corporate media wo n't allow any talk of holding this administration to account .
O ver this weekend and by noon today , 82,000 Americans signed a petition sponsored by Rep. Robert Wexler ( D - FL ) and two other members of the House Judiciary Committee , Reps. Luis Gutierrez ( D - IL ) and Tammy Baldwin ( D - WI ) , calling on that committee and its chairman , Rep. John Conyers ( D - MI ) to begin immediate hearings on Rep. Dennis Kucinich 's bill to impeach Vice President Dick Cheney .
There was no report in the nation 's corporate media on the three Judiciary Committee members ' call ( they are three senior members of the House Democratic Party ) , and no report on the remarkable public response to their petition .
As always when the story involves impeachable crimes by the Bush administration , the corporate media have been silent , devoting their pricey news minutes and their precious column inches to meaningless stories about the twin horseraces for the presidential nomination , which themselves have blacked out any word of the main crowd - pleasers in those campaigns : Republican Ron Paul and Democrat Kucinich .
Impeachment is the elephant in the room .
Everyone knows that this country is being run by a criminal syndicate that has rigged elections , hidden its knowledge of the 9 - 11 attacks , lied the country into war , plotted to out an important CIA undercover operative and then obstruct a criminal investigation into that treasonous act , subverted most of the articles of the Bill of Rights , emasculated the Congress and the Courts ( which it has also shamelessly packed with shameless hacks ) , betrayed veterans , surrendered a major American metropolis to the devastation of a hurricane , plotted to enable the declaring of martial law , tortured kidnapped and killed people in violation of international law and obstructed efforts to deal with the unprecedented crisis of global warming for an unconscionable seven years .
But the media wo n't allow any talk of holding this administration to account .
It 's not just that we are being told that the only power and duty we as citizens have is to vote once every two or four years ( after which we are supposed to shut up and consume ) , but that we are not to be told about , or are being encouraged not to talk about these larger crimes that are occurring , and worsening , day by day .
Impeachment is n't just off the table in the Congress .
It is off the table in the media and thus in public discourse .
This is intolerable .
It is only because of the alternative media that those 82,000 citizens knew of and signed onto Rep .
Wexler 's courageous call for impeachment hearings on Kucinich 's equally courageous bill .
We as citizens should not just be haranguing our representatives to demand that they support impeachment hearings .
We should be picketing our local news organizations and deluging them with calls and letters demanding that they stop the censorship and report the news honestly without fear or favor , as they are supposed to do .
Here follows a letter I just sent to the ombudsman at the New York Times : Dear Public Editor :
How can it not be news that last Friday , three senior , respected members of the House Judiciary Committee , six - termer Robert Wexler ( D - FL ) , leading hispanic member Luis Gutierrez ( D - IL ) and floor leader Tammy Baldwin ( D - WI ) , publicly called on the House Judiciary Committee to begin immediate hearings on Dennis Kucinich 's bill to impeach VP Dick Cheney ?
On Friday , Wexler announced that he was setting up a webside , asking for 50,000 people to sign on in support of his call for impeachment hearings .
By the end of the first day , he had 53,000 signatures and as of today , just three days after the site was established , there were 77,300 signatures , rising by the second .
There has been no report on this development in the impeachment story in the NY times , which is nothing short of astonishing .
I also hear from Wexler 's office that the Times rejected an op - ed submission written by the three congressmembers explaining their decision .
While of course the opinion page editors have the right to make what choices they like about what runs , they have elected to run rather obscure opinion pieces by politicians , often on positions that the editors do n't even disagree with .
Here is a case of a perspective that is not shared by the editors , by three real players in the debate , and they do n't deem it worthy of seeing print ?
As author of the book The Case for Impeachment , which was published by the mainstream publisher St. Martin's Press in 2006 , and which , after selling a respectable 20,000 copies , went to paperback , all without receiving a review or mention in the NY Times , or for that matter in any mainstream newspaper in the country , I am well aware that the impeachment movement , which has seen over 100 cities and towns and one state senate ( VT ) vote out resolutions calling for impeachment , and which is a key demand voiced at every major anti-war demonstration , is being completely blacked out by the major media , including the Times .
As a 34 - year veteran , award - winning journalist , a former Times contributor , a graduate of the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism , a two - time Journalism Fulbright Scholar , and the author of a well - regarded book on impeachment , I find the whole thing unconscionable , especially considering the incredible amount of ink-- and high - dudgeon editorials -- that were expended on the ridiculous Clinton impeachment less than a decade ago .
Your paper should do a better job of covering the news , and should stop covering up the news .

Matt Groening ( left ) , David Cohen , and Bender the robot at Groening 's studio . *
Photo : Sian Kennedy * David X. Cohen is watching a short animation clip on a computer monitor .
It 's a tight shot of two robots ' pelvises .
They thrust their cube - shaped midsections together and swap a DVD from one of their disc drives to the other .
This , Cohen explains , is footage of a sci - fi stage show , a suggestive all - robot version of Cirque du Soleil .
" Nothing makes me happier than a scene with no living being in it , " he says .
Cohen has another reason to be happy .
The segment he 's watching is from Futurama , the show that he codeveloped back in 1999 with Simpsons creator Matt Groening .
( Cohen wrote and produced some of the animated sitcom 's most popular episodes . )
With that pedigree , Futurama seemed like a can't - fail proposition , but it was canceled five years ago .
This footage , however , is new : Futurama is back in production , and the unexpected return is as curious as the story of its abrupt cancellation .
Set in the year 3000 , Futurama 's interstellar sci- fi future is n't a shiny utopia like The Jetsons or a dark dystopia like Blade Runner .
It 's a time that seems wonderful or awful depending on how you look at it — just like the present .
" On The Jetsons , there 's a machine that ties your tie for you , " Cohen says .
" On Futurama , there 'd be a machine that tied your tie , but it would malfunction and start strangling you . "
Those kinds of macabre twists would be Futurama 's undoing .
Fox was expecting something familiar , The Simpsons in space .
Executives certainly were not prepared for the bizarre contours of Groening and Cohen 's brave new world .
" The network 's attitude quickly went from tremendous excitement to great fear , " Groening says .
" They were very troubled by the suicide booth .
They did n't like the ' All - Tentacle Massage ' parlor . "
Futurama premiered to strong ratings , but as the show was shuffled around the schedule , viewership slipped .
Every season , the renewal notice came late — so late that there was n't always time to deliver a full slate of episodes .
After the fourth season , the people working on the show waited and waited for a renewal notice until they eventually assumed — correctly — that it was n't going to come .
" We did n't get to finish the way we would 've liked , " Cohen says .
Futurama was never a mass market success — it never generated universally known catchphrases like " Do n't have a cow , man " or a movie that grossed half a billion dollars .
It just attracted a niche of enthusiastic devotees .
But in the modern media landscape , a hardcore niche of fans can be all you need .
Futurama was killed , but like some B - movie cyborg it refused to stay dead .
The fans watched the 72 episodes religiously in syndication and shelled out $ 170 to get the entire run on DVD .
So , in 2005 , Fox green - lighted 16 new episodes .
Cohen and Groening have reassembled many of the hundreds of writers , animators , and voice artists who'd gone on to other projects to create four DVDs of new material , including sexy robot stage shows .
The first DVD hits stores on November 27 , and the features will then be divided into half - hour episodes when the entire run of the series begins airing on Comedy Central next year .
At last , Futurama is getting a fifth season .
Star Trek had a token alien crew member .
Futurama 's crew includes an alien , a mutant , and a robot .

Matt Groening 's studio in Santa Monica , California , is where Futurama is written and where Groening draws his comic strip , Life in Hell , which has been a newspaper fixture for nearly three decades .
It 's also where Groening keeps his music collection .
There 's an entire room stacked floor to ceiling with LPs , CDs , and tapes , everything from Swiss yodels to Balinese gamelan .
It 's a sunny afternoon in late September , and Groening 's a day late delivering the latest installment of Life in Hell .
" When I 'm procrastinating , I come in here and file a few dozen records , " he says .
Groening , 53 , is an omnivorous mediaphile , and it shows in his work .
The Simpsons began as a straightforward parody of the conventions of domestic sitcoms but quickly turned into a nonstop barrage of pop culture references and allusions .
For Futurama , Groening drew upon a childhood shaped by Isaac Asimov stories and the colorful covers of pulp magazines .
( There 's a stack of Amazing Stories and Fantastic Adventures from the 1950s on a shelf near a few of his Emmy statuettes . )
Groening shows me another media archive housed nearby in the studio : a wall full of sci - fi paperbacks .
He points to some that he and Cohen studied while working on their show .
Arthur C. Clarke !
Alfred Bester ! Stanislaw Lem ! Rudy Rucker !
Kurt Vonnegut !
Futurama plays off of what science fiction has taught us to expect from the future .
It plays off of Star Wars and 2001 just as The Simpsons plays off of Leave It to Beaver and The Brady Bunch .
But Groening 's sci- fi literacy is incomplete .
There 's a glaring black hole in the center of his geek cred , one that Futurama fans may have a hard time fathoming .
Matt Groening has never seen an episode of Star Trek .
Cohen , on the other hand , likes to brag that he 's never not watching Star Trek .
Which is one reason that Groening approached him to work on Futurama .
In the early 1980s , while Groening was making a name for himself as a cartoonist chronicling the punk rock and bohemian subcultures of LA , Cohen was making a name for himself on the New Jersey high school math - team circuit .
He went on to study physics at Harvard and get a master 's in computer science from UC Berkeley .
But he was also the president of The Harvard Lampoon , and he left academia to write comedy .
After he started working on The Simpsons in 1993 , he became fascinated by the " freeze framers " — obsessive fans who videotaped episodes so they could pause them and look for gags that lasted only a split second .
So he gave them little Easter eggs .
In a 1995 episode in which Homer Simpson enters an alternate universe and becomes a 3 - D model , Cohen inserted an equation into the background of one scene .
It seemed to offer a counterexample to Fermat 's last theorem .
Then he lurked on the alt .
tv.simpsons newsgroup to gauge the geek response .
( Confusion at first , then astonishment when they tested it , then despair when they discovered that it was accurate only to eight decimal places .
D'oh ! )
Cohen mercilessly lampooned the passion and the fickleness of these fans through the character Comic Book Guy .
He wrote the episode in which that character first utters the line " Worst . Episode .
Ever . "
( Cohen 's voice is a touch nasal ; he does an excellent rendition of this immortal phrase . )
By the time Groening tapped him to codevelop Futurama , Cohen had a rep as " the sci - fi guy " in the writers room , the one who scripted a parody of The Fly and lobbied for more screen time for slobbering alien characters Kang and Kodos .
Groening had already thought a lot about Futurama and had conceived many of the characters , but Cohen injected a left - brained sensibility , a background in math and computers ... and that encyclopedic knowledge of Star Trek .
The two sketched out their vision of the year 3000 on a whiteboard , which now sits in a storage area at Groening 's studio .
Among the tenets they set down : Robots should have their own soap operas .
There wo n't just be smart dust and smartphones , there 'll be smart sausage .
Medicine will be much more advanced , so slapstick humor can include amputations .
A quote credited to Cohen is the centerpiece of the board : " Reality should not stand in the way of comedy . "
Futurama focuses on the staff of an interstellar package delivery service : a 150 - year - old inventor and his prepubescent clone , a one - eyed mutant , a kleptomaniacal robot , and a nebbish from the 20th century who just emerged from a cryofreezer .
One week their jobs might take them to a planet where all the creatures are pure liquid ( hijinks ensue when someone accidentally guzzles the emperor ) .
Another week they might visit a planet inhabited by giant slugs , which excrete an addictive substance that 's become the most popular soft drink in the galaxy .
Cohen explained to Groening that there had to be a doctor character on Futurama — like " Bones " McCoy on Star Trek .
But in a clever inversion of Dr. McCoy — a human frequently called upon to treat weird aliens —
Cohen dreamed up Dr. Zoidberg , a crustacean - like physician with a distressingly limited knowledge of human anatomy .
The two carefully plotted a story arc and a series of revelations that could unveil over several seasons .
Then they took it to the network .
" It was the most worked - out pitch in Fox history , " Cohen says .
After the show got a green light , Cohen assembled the geekiest writing staff television had ever seen : one MA in math , one MA in computer science , one MA in philosophy , one PhD in chemistry , one PhD in applied math , and some normals to balance things out .
" I went from Home Improvement , where people earnestly pitched jokes about farting and table saws , to a place where there were discussions about nanophysics and string theory and quantum mechanics , " writer Eric Horsted says .
" I could only follow the conversation for a few minutes before my brain would start sweating and I 'd have to reach for a copy of People . "
Cohen was the head writer and showrunner , handling the day - to - day operations and directing voice - over sessions .
Groening chimed in on what was funny and what was n't and shielded the staff from network interference as much as he could ... even when they had a character traveling back in time and inadvertently sleeping with his own grandmother .
" I 'm very proud that I never said no , " Groening declares .
( That episode went on to win an Emmy . )
The comedic style of Futurama was similar to The Simpsons : A single joke could blossom into an increasingly hilarious cluster of gags .
And there were lots of celebrity guest voices .
( In the year 3000 , many 20th - century celebrities ' heads have been preserved in jars . )
The animation was by Rough Draft Studios — it had done ink and paint work for The Simpsons and caused a stir with The Maxx , which combined hand - drawn art with CGI and live action .
Rough Draft 's artists smoothed out Groening 's sketches but maintained the essential feel .
For instance , the delivery company 's spaceship is a 3 - D model as sleek as a star barge from Amazing Stories , but the prow appears to have an overbite , like a Simpsons character .
The show premiered on Sunday , March 28 , 1999 , at 8:30 pm , immediately after The Simpsons .
But within a year , it was moved to 7 pm , where it was usually preempted by football games .
" After they moved us to 7 , they launched a promotional campaign with the tagline ' The Fun Begins at 8 ! ' "
Groening says .
" I never got that .
I think ' The Fun Begins at 7 ! ' just rolls off the tongue . "
At Rough Draft Studios in Glendale , California , these artists working on paper get windows .
The CGI geeks work in the dark basement .
After the cancellation of Futurama and the delivery of the last episodes in 2002 , the staff dispersed .
Several of the writers went to work on The Simpsons .
One who had scripted a note - perfect satire of Star Trek actually went to work on Star Trek : Enterprise .
Cohen wrote a couple of pilots , including an animated comedy called Grandmaster Freak & the Furious 15 that would have starred rapper Ice Cube .
Ever the math buff , Cohen was excited about the many different ways to geometrically arrange Grandmaster Freak and his posse onscreen .
But Futurama refused to die .
Cartoon Network began airing reruns in January 2003 , and they were greeted with wild enthusiasm .
" It was beating late - night talk shows in key demographics , like 18 - to 34 - year - old men , " Cohen says .
The show has also been a hit on DVD .
Sales figures are closely guarded , but one of the nerdier writers calculated that , based on their residual checks , the total gross to date is more than $ 100 million .
" One of the great things about the show was the instantaneous , intense fan reaction , " Groening says .
It operated on several levels , rewarding multiple viewings , and it was full of catnip for geeks :
In addition to the riffs on The Twilight Zone , Star Trek , and Star Wars , there were allusions to classic videogames , programming languages , Schrdinger 's cat , and the Heisenberg uncertainty principle .
" The operating principle of Futurama was that you can do a joke that 1 percent of the audience gets , as long as it does n't derail the enjoyment of the mass audience , " Cohen says .
" And that 1 percent becomes a fan for life . "
Some jokes in Futurama were written in a strange alphabet that fans had to decrypt .
" Most were jokes about aliens eating people , " Cohen says .
" Like , an alien sign on a restaurant says TASTY HUMAN BURGERS . "
He checked the Web a few hours after the pilot aired and discovered that the freeze framers had already cracked the code .
A trickier alien alphabet was devised .
Soon , the obsessive audience members knew the mythology of the show better than its creators .
" We 'd have to search the fan sites to check references we 'd forgotten , " says Patric Verrone , a Futurama writer .
For instance , in one episode a character casually explains that all videotapes were erased hundreds of years before by the Second Coming of Jesus .
None of the writers could remember the specific year .
But a Web fan had created a detailed timeline of the show , which noted that the resurrection and erasure occurred in 2443 .
In 2005 , Groening and Cohen met with Fox execs to discuss the possibility of bringing the show back for a feature - length DVD .
" It was a great meeting , " Cohen says .
" One of the first things we heard was that two DVDs would work better than one . "
The network eventually agreed to fund four features , which would be divided into 16 episodes for syndication — nearly a full season .
For instance , one DVD , " The Beast With a Billion Backs , " can be viewed as a full - length movie about a creature that carries on a simultaneous affair with everyone in the galaxy .
But it can also be viewed as four 22 - minute installments .
Groening seems almost stunned by the support and encouragement of the network .
" It 's been , " he hesitates , searching for the words , " different .
They 've really been gracious and enthusiastic and supportive . "
But that has n't softened the tone of the show .
The new episodes feature a product called Torgo's Executive Powder , an all - purpose substance that 's used as a cleanser , an explosive , and a treatment for jock itch .
It 's supposedly made from ground - up Fox network execs .
On a monitor , there 's a wireframe 3 - D image of what looks like a Death Star .
We 're in the Rough Draft Studios office in Glendale , California .
Actually , we 're directly under the Salvation Army next door ; the studio had to expand when it was working on the original Futurama episodes back in 2000 .
During the busiest months last year , when both the new Futurama episodes and The Simpsons Movie were in production , there were 140 people employed here and an additional 500 in Rough Draft 's sister studio in South Korea .
Rough Draft 's director of CGI , Scott Vanzo , explains that the tricky part of mixing 3 - D animation with traditional 2 - D animation is making the 3 - D look suitably rough .
This Death Star model is from the climactic sequence of the first new DVD .
A group of nudist alien con artists have bilked the people of Earth out of all their possessions , including the planet itself .
Then the nudist aliens do what any colonizing force would do — they surround Earth with solid gold , jewel - encrusted Death Stars .
A ragtag band of Earthicans ( not Earthlings — they now call themselves Earthicans ) leads a last - ditch attack on these Death Stars .
The rebels include Futurama 's main characters , the Harlem Globetrotters , and the mascots of three major holidays : Robot Santa , Kwanzaa - bot , and the Hannukah Zombie .
Oh , and also Al Gore .
Gore provides his own voice — it's his third time on the show .
He appeared the first time as the leader of the Vice Presidential Action Rangers , and then as Emperor of the Moon , but the new DVD is his finest hour .
Geeks will be on the edge of their seats as the Nobel laureate fights his way past the defenses of the nudist aliens and enters a gold Death Star through an unguarded vent , shouting , " Finally , I get to save the Earth with deadly lasers instead of deadly slide shows ! "
Cohen says that they 're giving hardcore fans no excuse to wait for the airing on Comedy Central next year .
" We 're producing it in HD with 5.1 surround sound , and we 're filling up every bit of available space on the disc , " he says .
There 'll be a few minutes of material that wo n't appear on the TV versions of each episode , an in - depth lecture on the role of mathematics in the show , and a full episode of Everybody Loves Hypnotoad , the most popular show in the 31st century .
It consists of a shot of the titular amphibian , who fixes viewers with his trance - inducing gaze .
( Diehards who watch the motionless toad for half an hour will discover hilarious fake commercial breaks and a few other surprises . )
Cohen credits DVD sales as the force behind Futurama 's return .
" This new revenue stream saved our neck , " he says .
" It might be a very brief window when DVDs are so powerful .
If the show had been on 10 years earlier , we'd be dead .
A few years from now , when Internet speeds are better , maybe one person buys it and shares it with a hundred of their friends . "
Back at Groening 's studio , he is talking up an idea he had for another episode inspired by Kevin Kelly 's death clock .
Kelly recently calculated how much longer he had to live — he estimates around 23 years — and posted his own personal life countdown clock online .
" I started thinking , would n't it be cool if you had a death wristwatch ? "
Groening says .
He and Cohen bat around the story potential of the death wristwatch .
Surely , by the year 3000 , a gadget like that could recalculate the time of your death on the fly , beeping if you are in imminent danger of dying ?
They start toying with the concept :
Would n't it be funny if the death wristwatch were running fast ?
What if the battery died ?
All of the episodes for the Futurama DVDs have already been written , and as far as these two know that 's the end of the show — for real this time .
But they continue plotting , just in case .
" It would be a great episode , and there 's a message there , " Groening says .
" You can't live your life constantly looking at the death clock . "

George Packer has another thoughtful and well - written article about Iraq .
His discussion of the remaining options draws this comment from Josh Marshall :
If our options before ranged from bad to worse , they now range from worse to horrible .
Packer , of course , was originally a war supporter , and as far as I know has never repudiated that position .
Thus he seems to me to be continually engaged in explaining his reasoning , to put it euphemistically .
To his credit he does not shy away from the responsibility of the US for the disaster we ’ve created .
The inability of Iraq ’s communities to reconcile does n’t absolve the United States of responsibility .
Instead , it raises a new set of moral and strategic questions that are , in their way , more painful than at any other phase of the war .
Facing these questions requires American leaders to do what they have not yet done — to look beyond the next three or six months , to the next two or three years .
When America prepares , inevitably , to leave , what can we do to limit the damage that will follow our departure , not just for Iraq ’s sake but for our own ?
In this article , in fact , he attempts to turn that responsibility in favor of his argument , which I take to be that a continued presence will be necessary for at least five years .
But he does n’t explicitly state that or any other position as his own , so I may be projecting .
He ’s naturally quite willing to allocate blame to the Bush administration ’s faith - based foreign policy , quoting one former official as saying “ What happens if , at the eleventh hour , we ’re witnessing one of the most remarkable feats in American history on the part of a general ? …
If that ’s the case , why do you want to give up now ? ”
Suppose some magical situation came along , then assume it ’s currently true and act on that .
But Packer seems to me to be in the thrall of illusions that are just as destructive in the long term .
His views are vastly more sophisticated , and they attempt to shoulder the obvious responsibility of the US to help the country we destroyed .
Though it ’s impossible to know for sure he thinks from the article , it ’s telling that in his discussion of the proposal of Senators Reed and Levin ( begin withdrawing troops within four months , leaving only a “ limited presence ” ) he notes the agreement of Senators Clinton , Obama , Biden , and Warner , but the only person he quotes is Lamar Alexander : “ You have the President being inflexible and the Democrats playing politics ” .
Certainly that ’s a fair statement of an argument made by the moderate Republicans and the wimpy liberals , but why is that the only position worthy of a quote from a Senator ?
The point I most agree with in the article is that Americans need to start thinking ahead , considering the results of our policies and actions .
Fat chance , but an excellent recommendation .
Our television - and - fast - food society is all about immediate gratification , an infantile approach but one we ’re hooked on .
We do n’t want to think about the effects on others of our own actions , or indeed the effects on ourselves in the future .
Packer ’s article , above all , attempts to take on this task and contribute to this discussion .
We need more people doing that , especially those like him who write well and think deeply .
Discussing our options is an unpleasant business , because they ’re all bad .
As far as I know , no one anywhere on the spectrum denies this .
To me it seems that one ’s view of what we should do arises in large part from what one thinks about the role of the United States in the world .
For example , Packer quotes Colin Kahl , a professor of security studies at Georgetown : “ If Bush keeps the pedal on the surge until the end of his Presidency , we will rocket off the cliff , and it guarantees that the next President will get elected on a pledge to get us out of Iraq now . ”
The context seems to indicate that Packer and Kahl agree this would be a bad move .
One way in which Iraq and Vietnam — two wars doomed to be endlessly compared — are not the same is in the implications of America ’s departure .
Contrary to Bush ’s recent claim , the American exit from Vietnam did n’t lead to the Cambodian genocide ( U.S. actions during the war did ) , and , for all the bloodiness of the aftermath in Vietnam , it was not a strategic disaster .
America ’s prestige was damaged , but the dominoes did not fall , and the civil wars in Southeast Asia did not affect the larger history of the Cold War .
But Iraq , sitting in the geographical heart of the Middle East , on top of all that oil and radicalism , is unlikely to become marginal .
In 1966 , Senator George Aiken gave Lyndon Johnson some memorable advice about what to do in Vietnam : Declare victory and get out .
In contemplating a change in American policy on Iraq , one former Bush Administration official turned the advice around : “ Declare defeat and stay in . ”
In a nutshell , I take that to be Packer ’s position .
He talks about the necessity of engaging the rest of the world in the stabilization of Iraq , postulates that the world would be willing to help if we acknowleded our failure while remaining engaged , and reiterates the argument that a bloody civil war will be the result of a rapid American withdrawal .
The spectacle , televised around the world , would deepen the feeling that America is indifferent to human , especially Muslim , life .
It would brand the U.S. as untrustworthy to potential allies and feckless to potential enemies .
And it would destroy what ’s left of American prestige .
Toby Dodge , an Iraq expert at Queen Mary College of the University of London , who also served on the strategic - assessment team , told me , “ What has defeated America in Iraq , apart from the failure of the state and its own incompetence , are a bunch of radicals with nothing more sophisticated than reëngineered artillery shells and rocket - propelled grenades .
That is a loss of cataclysmic proportions . ”
My view is that the historical record strongly supports these contentions :
The US is indifferent to human life unless it happens to be American , white , and middle - class or above .
The US is untrustworthy as a potential ally .
Another defeat of the American military by technologically unsophisticated radicals will merely reinforce the accurate perception that nationalist insurgencies nearly always win .
Packer does a great service by attempting to focus our attention on the implications of our actions .
David Kilcullen , an Australian counter - insurgency adviser who served on Petraeus ’s staff in the first half of the year , said , “ The real question is not withdrawal dates or troop numbers .
The real question is :
What do we want Iraq to look like once we do n’t have a hundred and sixty thousand troops there ?
And is what we want achievable ? ”
My question is , why is it up to us to decide what Iraq should look like — is n’t that what got us into this situation to begin with ?
I would argue that , once we follow Packer ’s lead , transcend our short - term thinking , and assume our adult responsibilities , the central question is our role in the world .
The assumption underlying the various positions that converge on maintaining an American military presence in Iraq for five to ten years is , I think , that it ’s our responsibility to decide what the world should look like , to offer everyone a chance to be like us .
A empire of soft power , backed up by the largest military in history .
In short , a kinder , gentler empire .
The liberal interventionists seem to me to be as entranced by American military might as the neo-cons , and to entertain illusions that are less blithe but equally incorrect .
At the other of the question are those who maintain that the US cannot and should not attempt to determine the shape of the world , that we should stop trying to dominate and start leading by example .
That means no bombing anywhere , unless we ’re attacked first and we can prove who did it .
That means no invasions .
That means not selling arms to the worst actors in the world , indeed not basing our economy on arms sales ; not supporting countries that engage in ethnic separation of populations , by arms or by fence ; not refusing to talk to anyone who wants a dialog ; not threatening people with force .
We can change the world for the better by helping people around the world , by offering assistance rather than requiring coöperation .
As long as we act through our military , while China negotiates contracts in Africa and Asia , and Cuba sends doctors to the poorest , we will appear to be what we are : a military empire , in it for ourselves , unable to provide even for our own because we ’re so busy making money on war .

For one company , FISA wiretaps carry a $ 1 K pricetag Nick Juliano
Published : Tuesday October 16 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This Although the scope of surveillance conducted under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Act remains shrouded in secrecy , newly disclosed documents show the costs one company charges the government to eavesdrop on customers .
Comcast , which is among the nation 's largest telecommunication companies , charges $ 1,000 to install a FISA wiretap and $ 750 for each additional month authorities want to keep an eye on suspects , according to the company 's Handbook for Law Enforcement .
Secrecy News obtained the document and published it Monday .
" I was actually surprised that this was such a routine transaction that it would have a set fee , " said Steven Aftergood , director of the Federation of American Scientists ' Project on Government Secrecy .
Aftergood , who runs the Secrecy News blog , told RAW STORY that the Comcast document was the only one he has seen outlining wiretap procedures and costs , so he could n't compare Comcast 's fees with those charged by other telecoms .
The Comcast handbook says the company will comply with legal requests from federal , state and local authorities to monitor the communications of criminal suspects , and the company notes legal ambiguity surrounding some of the more controversial tools that have emerged since Sept. 11 , 2001 .
The manual says an FBI agent must hand deliver National Security Letters to Comcast 's headquarters in Philadelphia .
" Upon receipt Comcast will handle all documents with the appropriate care and security as required by law , " the handbook says .
" Attention must be paid to the various court proceedings in which the legal status of such requests is at issue . "
Aftergood acknowledged that the handbook does n't do much by way of establishing the scope of FISA surveillance or NSLs .
" I think it 's more or an interesting nugget " of information , " Aftergood said .
" Even if there are let 's say 100 or 200 $ 1,000 payments ( for FISA intercepts ) over the course of a year , I think those would be indistinguishable from the larger revenue stream . "

WASHINGTON , Sept. 6 — Makers of drugs and medical devices would be required to report publicly nearly all payments and gifts to doctors under legislation introduced Thursday in the Senate .
“ Right now , the public has no way to know whether a doctor ’s been given money that might affect prescribing habits , ” said Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa , the ranking Republican on the Senate Finance Committee and one of the bill ’s authors .
Senator Herb Kohl , Democrat of Wisconsin , said drug and medical device makers had long defended their payments and gifts to doctors as appropriate .
“ If that is the case , full disclosure will only serve to prove them right , ” Mr. Kohl said .
Ken Johnson , senior vice president at the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America , said , “ A new law is not necessary when pharmaceutical marketing is already heavily regulated by the Food and Drug Administration . ”
The federal Election Assistance Commission – the agency created after the 2000 presidential debacle that is tasked with overseeing voting machine testing and serving as a clearinghouse for election administration information – published a survey of the 2006 election today that reveals some interesting stats .
The information , collected from election administrators nationwide , covers the number of registered voters per jurisdiction , voter turnout , types of voting systems used , percentage of votes cast by absentee and provisional ballots , etc .
One interesting nugget concerns the number of ballots cast vs. ballots counted in the election .
According to the report , about 82 million ballots were " cast or counted " in the 2006 election ( the number is n't exact because not every jurisdiction responded to the survey ) .
But some 3.2 million ballots that were cast never got counted .
[ I should note here that it 's really confusing that the EAC refers to the 82 million ballots as " cast or counted " since it is n't possible for a ballot to be counted if it was n't cast – at least not a legal ballot .
It would have been better for the report to just say " 82 million ballots were cast . " ]
The report provides a table showing the number of ballots that went uncounted by state ( see the middle column in the table at right ) .
For example , in Florida 122,759 ballots went uncounted in 2006 .
In California , the number was 416,260 ballots .
Illinois held the record , however , with a whopping 889,012 uncounted ballots .
Some of these figures seem less severe when you look at them as percentages ( in California , for example , the 400,000 uncounted ballots amount to a little less than 5 percent of the ballots that were cast ) .
But this is n't likely to be of consolation to voters who made the effort to cast a ballot but never had their vote counted or to candidates who may have lost their races by narrow margins and could have used the extra push from uncounted ballots .
And the number of uncounted ballots in Illinois is n't helped by converting it to a percentage ( nearly 25 percent of ballots cast in that state went uncounted ) .
So why do ballots go uncounted ?
It 's not always clear .
Take provisional ballots for example .
Although a little more than 794,000 provisional ballots were cast in polling places , only 79.5 percent of them were counted .
Provisional ballots are given to voters who arrive at polls but whose name ( for whatever reason ) does n't appear on the voter registration list ( perhaps through clerical error or the voter showed up at the wrong precinct ) .
The ballots are usually rejected if it turns out that the voter was ineligible to vote or had already voted by absentee ballot or at another polling location , but the report does n't really specify .
With regard to absentee ballots that were cast in 2006 , 347,000 of these never got counted .
In some cases voters did n't return the ballots on time .
In other cases , voters failed to sign the ballot envelope .
But more than 52,000 ballots were rejected for " other " unspecified reasons .
To see what else the report covers , you can read it here ( PDF ) .
It would be great if all voting jurisdictions were required to participate in these post-election surveys so that stats like these could be more precise and more easily compared over time .
UPDATE : A reader has pointed out some problems with the EAC 's survey numbers , particularly with regard to the table I highlighted showing the number of ballots counted in states as a percentage of the total number of ballots cast in those states .
As reader Bob Richards correctly points out in the comments to this post , the percentages are based in some cases on uneven figures due to the fact that the EAC was unable to collect complete sets of data from every jurisdiction in a state .
Take Illinois as an example .
According to the EAC 's table 28a , it appears that 25 percent of all ballots cast in that state did n't get counted .
But if you look at tables 26 and 27 that break out the numbers of ballots cast and counted , you can see that not all jurisdictions responded to both questions in the survey .
Illinois has 110 voting jurisdictions ( the first column in each table lists the number of jurisdictions , or " Jur " in each state ) , but only 3 of those jurisdictions responded to the question asking how many absentee ballots were cast .
Then on table 27 , it shows that 5 jurisdictions responded to the question asking how many absentee ballots were actually counted .
With regard to provisional ballots , 77 Illinois jurisdictions responded to the question asking how many provisional ballots were cast , but on table 27 we see that only 62 jurisdictions responded to the question asking how many of those ballots were actually counted .
Since we do n't have complete or equal reporting on both questions , the percentages factored from the responses to those questions are n't trustworthy .
I pointed out in my original post that the EAC did n't have complete numbers from all jurisdictions but I did n't realize the extent to which this made the EAC 's report so unreliable .
On page 17 of the report , the authors discuss this problem with the data , but noted only that " States that reported figures below 95 percent ( e.g. , Arkansas , Illinois , Indiana , New Mexico , Pennsylvania , Texas , and West Virginia ) have inconsistencies in the manner in which data were collected and reported . "
But per my conversation with Kim Brace , one of the authors of the EAC report and the founder of Election Data Services , the problems with the figures are even more extensive than the EAC report suggests .
Brace told me that there 's a huge problem with trying to collect reliable data from election administrators in general because jurisdictions across the country collect and define data in different ways .
For example , some jurisdictions define the number of ballots cast at precincts as the number of signatures in a pollbook , not the number of ballots that were actually cast in the precinct .
So if a voter signs the pollbook but gets frustrated with the long line and leaves before casting a ballot , some jurisdictions would still count this as a cast ballot .
This same problem crops up in reporting voter turnout .
In the 2004 presidential election , Brace said that 902 counties failed to keep track of the number of voters who showed up at the polls .
Instead , they counted the number of votes that were cast in the presidential race to determine their voter turnout .
If a voter left the presidential race blank , he was n't included in the voter turnout numbers .
Problems also crop up with the voter registration numbers in the EAC report .
Some counties , in counting their voter registration numbers , only include active voters in that count .
Other counties count active and inactive voters .
( A voter is defined as inactive when he 's registered to vote but has failed to turn out for two of the last federal elections and mail sent to him from election administrators is either unanswered or returned as undeliverable . )
This might seem like a minor issue but Brace points out that in California there are 15 million active voters and 6 million inactive ones .
It can really distort the registration numbers if counties do n't have a single definition for what constitutes a registered voter and the figures are off by a couple million .
So why has the EAC bothered to put so much effort into a survey that is filled with incomplete and distorted data ?
Brace says it 's the best that anyone has managed to do so far .
The EAC is working on improving its survey and getting counties to respond ( this is only the second election survey it 's conducted ) .
Brace says hopefully the 2008 survey will be better .
But it appears that since the EAC can't force counties to respond to the survey or collect and track data in a uniform manner , there 's little hope that will happen .

No one wants to utter the word “ depression . ”
But the truth of the matter is that the American economy may be entering a state of free fall .
Every day brings more bad news about the sub - prime mortgage debacle , about home foreclosures , construction industry slowdowns , a credit drought for consumers and businesses , oil price shocks and the open - ended devaluation of the dollar .
Where is it all leading ?
Together with the debacle in Iraq and the political implosion of the Republican Party , this economic collapse could make the presidential election of 2008 a turning point in American political history .
Conservatism first triumphed over New Deal liberalism thanks in part to the same deadly combination in the late 1970s : a lost war and an economic crisis .
The Vietnam War plus stagflation and deindustrialization gave us Ronald Reagan .
Now history is returning the favor , as the free - market conservative political order of the last generation faces a systemic crisis from which there is no easy escape .
Even the soberest economy watchers , pundits with doctorates -- whose dismal record in predicting anything tempts me not to mention this -- are prophesying dark times ahead .
A depression , or a slump so deep it ’s not worth quibbling about the difference , appears to be on the way , if indeed it is not already underway .
Start with the confidence game being run out of Wall Street .
The sub - prime mortgage crisis occupies newspaper front pages day after outrageous day .
Certainly , these tales of greed and financial malfeasance are numbingly familiar .
Yet precisely that sense of deja vu -- of Enron revisited , of an endless cascade of scandalous , irrational behavior affecting the central financial institutions of our world -- suggests just how dire things have become .
Advertisement
Once upon a time , all through the 19th century , financial panics -- often precipitating more widespread economic slumps -- were a commonly accepted , if dreaded , part of “ normal ” economic life .
Then the crash of 1929 , followed by the New Deal Keynesian regulatory state called into being to prevent its recurrence , made these cyclical extremes rare .
Beginning with the stock market crash of 1987 , however ( and followed by the collapse of the savings and loan industry at the end of the 1980s and the near - meltdown of Long Term Capital Management in 1998 that required an emergency , government - assisted bailout ) , financial panics have become ever more common again .
Most notorious -- until now , that is -- were the dot - com implosion of 2000 and the Enronization that followed .
Enron seems like only yesterday because , in fact , it was only yesterday , which strongly suggests that the financial sector is now out of control .
At least three factors lurk behind this new reality .
Thanks to the Reagan counterrevolution , there is precious little left of the regulatory state -- the repeal of the Glass - Steagall Act separating investment from commercial banking is a prime example -- and what remains is effectively run by those who most need to be regulated .
( Despite bitter complaints about it in the business community , the Sarbanes - Oxley Act , passed in the wake of the big corporate and accounting scandals of recent years in an effort to restore public confidence in the capital markets , has proved weak tea indeed , as the current financial meltdown indicates . )
More significantly , for at least the last quarter of a century the whole U.S. economic system has lived off the speculations generated by the financial sector -- sometimes given the acronym FIRE ( for finance , insurance and real estate ) .
It has grown exponentially while , in the country ’s industrial heartland in particular , much of the rest of the economy has withered away .
FIRE carries enormous weight and the capacity to do great harm .
Its growth , moreover , has fed a proliferation of financial activities and assets so complex and arcane that even their designers do n’t fully understand how they operate .

Today ’s Wall Street fabricators of avant - garde financial instruments are actually called “ financial engineers . ”
They got their training in “ labs ” much like Dr. Frankenstein ’s , located at Wharton , Princeton , Harvard and Berkeley .
Each time one of their concoctions goes south , like the bewildering “ security investment vehicles ” that helped precipitate the mortgage industry collapse , they scratch their heads in bewilderment -- always making sure , of course , that they have financial life rafts handy , while investors , employees , suppliers and whole communities go down with the ship .
What makes Wall Street ’s latest crisis so portentous , however , is the way it is interacting with , and infecting , healthier parts of the economy .
When the dot - com bubble burst , many innocents were hurt , not just denizens of the Street .
Still , its effect turned out to be limited .
Now , because of the sub - prime mortgage meltdown , Main Street is under the gun .
It is not only a matter of mass foreclosures .
It is not merely a question of collapsing home prices .
It is not simply the shutting down of large portions of the construction industry ( which is inspiring some of the doom - and - gloom prognostications ) .
It is not just the born - again skittishness of financial institutions that have , all of a sudden , gotten religion , rediscovered the word “ prudence ” and wo n’t lend to anybody .
It is all of this , taken together , that points ominously to a general collapse of the credit structure that has shored up consumer capitalism for decades .
The equity built up during the long housing boom has been the main fallback position for ordinary people financing their big - ticket - item expenses , from college educations to consumer durables , from trading up in the housing market to vacationing abroad .
Much of that equity has suddenly vanished , and more of it soon will .
Also drying up fast are the lifelines of credit that allow all sorts of small and medium - size businesses to function and hire people .
Whole communities , industries and regional economies are in jeopardy .

All of that might be considered enough , but there ’s more .
Oil , of course .
Here the connection to Iraq is clear ; but , arguably , the wild escalation of petroleum prices might have happened anyway .
Certainly the energy price explosion exacerbates the general economic crisis , in part by raising the costs of production all across the economy and so abetting the forces of economic contraction .
In the same way , each increase in the price of oil further contributes to what most now agree is a nearly insupportable level in the U.S. balance - of - payments deficit .
That , in turn , is contributing to the steady withering away of the value of the dollar .
Finally , it is vital to recall that this tsunami of bad business is about to wash over an already very sick economy .
While the old regime , the Reagan - Bush counterrevolution , has lived off the heady vapors of the FIRE sector , it has left in its wake a deindustrialized nation , full of super - exploited immigrants and millions of families whose earnings have suffered steady erosion .
Two wage - earners , working longer hours , are now needed to ( barely ) sustain a standard of living once earned by one .
And that does n’t count the melting away of health insurance , pensions and other forms of protection against the vicissitudes of the free market or natural calamities .
This perfect storm will be upon us just as the election season heats up , and it will inevitably hasten the already well - advanced implosion of the Republican Party .
The congressional elections of 2006 registered the first seismic shock , and since then , independents and moderate Republicans have continued to indicate in growing numbers in the polls that they are leaving the Grand Old Party .
The Wall Street Journal has reported on a growing loss of faith among important circles of business and finance .
Hard - core religious right - wingers are airing their doubts in public .
Libertarians delight in the apostate candidacy of Ron Paul .
Conservative populist resentment of immigration runs head on into the corporate elite ’s determination to enlarge a large pool of cheap labor .
All signs are ominous for the GOP .
The credibility and legitimacy of the old order are operating at a steep discount .
Faced with dire predicaments at home and abroad , they essentially do nothing except rattle those sabers , captives of their own now - bankrupt ideology .
Anything , many will decide , is better than this .
Three police forces and the US Coast Guard on Saturday night chased down a Medford - area man who faces the possibility of federal charges after allegedly pointing a hand - held laser beam at a helicopter .
" What goes through one 's mind ? . . .
You never know what 's on the other end of a laser , " said Sergeant Robert Bousquet of the State Police .
State Police pilots were on a routine security mission , guarding a liquid natural gas tanker near shore at about 9:15 p.m. Saturday night , Bousquet said .
They noticed a laser light touching their helicopter .
Using sophisticated equipment on their helicopter , including cameras , they pinpointed the origin of the light in the Medford - Somerville area , Bousquet said .
The search was on - involving authorities from the Coast Guard , the State Police , the Medford Police Department , and the Somerville Police Department .
About 90 minutes later , police found an adult male .
Bousquet would not say exactly how police located him , nor would he identify the man because charges have not been filed , though " illuminating an aircraft " is a federal offense .
He said the investigation was turned over to federal officials .
The light never interfered with the pilots ' vision , nor is there any link to a terrorist threat , Bousquet said .
Even if it was an ill - advised prank , Bousquet said , the possibilities for criminal intent are broad when a pilot is faced with a laser beam .

Acting judge Nigel Rein , handing down his judgment today , ruled against Thomas and ordered him to hand over the plane for the agreed amount .
The date of the handover will be decided next week .
" It follows that , in my view , a binding contract was formed between the plaintiff and the defendent and that it should be specifically enforced , " Justice Rein said in his decision .
The judgment sets a precedent for future cases and means eBay sales could now be legally binding .
A judge had last year ruled the plane could not be moved from its hangar in Albury until the dispute was settled .
Smythe , an Adelaide war - plane enthusiast , was the only person to bid on the item , matching the $ 150,000 reserve price just seconds before the auction ended in August last year .
But Thomas , a radilologist from Albury , had already agreed to sell the plane to someone else for $ 100,000 more than Smythe 's offer .
Smythe took him to court hoping a judge would force Thomas to follow through with the sale .
Before the ruling was handed down , eBay spokesman Daniel Feiler was adamant that any decision would have no impact on public confidence in the auction site .
" It has always been our understanding that you are entering into a binding contract when you are listing an item and someone has made a bid on the item , " he said , but added real estate sales were an exception because bids on houses were only expressions of interest .
" If someone has a repeated behaviour of not purchasing or refusing to sell the item once the thing has ended , normally we 'll reach out and educate them in the first instance but if they then show a repeated habit of not fulfilling their commitments then they get suspended from the site , " he said .
Feiler added eBay sellers had the option to reject any bids before an auction closed and encouraged both buyers and sellers to examine feedback history before proceeding with a transaction .
eBay has 5 million Australian members and 17,000 of those make their primary living from selling there , according to ACNielsen .
The Temora Aviation Museum , which houses its own Wirraway plane , said a total of 755 were built in Australia between 1939 and 1946 .
A spokeswoman for the museum said she had not seen the plane referred to in this case but estimated it was worth around $ 250,000 .
There has been a lot of discussion over the past few weeks about who Time would pick as their Person of the Year .
Most people figured it would either be Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , the Pope , some random politician from America , or Steve Sutton .
During this trying time , the Something Awful Forum Goons did not hesitate to speculate .
What follows are their best guesses as to who would be Person of the Year .
Not surprisingly , very few of their guesses actually involve real people .
In the end , they were all wrong .
Soviet leader Yuri Andropov got the nod .
The SniperZERO got things started by proving he does n't actually know of any real people .

# 11 : Monkey - Head Transplant
When Vladimir Demikhov unveiled his two - headed dogs in 1954 , it inspired a strange kind of surgical arms race between the two superpowers .
Or rather , a head race .
Eager to prove that its surgeons were actually the best in the world , the American government began funding the work of Robert White , who then embarked on a series of experimental surgeries , performed at his brain research center in Cleveland , Ohio , resulting in the world 's first successful monkey - head transplant .
The head transplant occurred on March 14 , 1970 .
It took White and his assistants hours to perform the carefully choreographed operation , separating a monkey 's head from its body and reattaching it to a new body .
When the monkey woke and found that its body had been switched for a new one , it angrily tracked White with its eyes and snapped at him with its teeth .
The monkey survived a day and a half before succumbing to complications from the surgery .
As bad as it was for the monkey , it could have been worse .
White noted that , from a surgical point of view , it would have been easier to put the monkey 's head on backwards .
White thought he should have been treated like a hero , but instead the public was appalled by what he had done .
Nevertheless ,
White soldiered on , campaigning to raise support for a human head transplant .
He toured with Craig Vetovitz , a near - quadriplegic , who volunteered to be the first to undergo the procedure .
But to date , a human - head transplant has not yet been performed .

# 12 : The Remote - Controlled Bull Yale researcher Jose Delgado stood in the hot sun of a bullring in Cordova , Spain .
With him in the ring was a large , angry bull .
The animal noticed him and began to charge .
It gathered speed .
Delgado appeared defenseless , but when the bull was mere feet away , Delgado pressed a button on a remote control unit in his hand , sending a signal to a chip implanted in the bull 's brain .
Abruptly , the animal stopped in its tracks .
It huffed and puffed a few times , and then walked docilely away .
Delgado 's experience in the ring was an experimental demonstration of the ability of his " stimoceiver " to manipulate behavior .
The stimoceiver was a computer chip , operated by a remote - control unit , that could be used to electrically stimulate different regions of an animal 's brain .
Such stimulation could produce a wide variety of effects , including the involuntary movement of limbs , the eliciting of emotions such as love or rage , or the inhibition of appetite .
It could also be used , as Delgado showed , to stop a charging bull .
Delgado 's experiment sounds so much like science fiction , that many people are surprised to learn it occurred back in 1963 .
During the 1970s and 80s , research into electrical stimulation of the brain ( ESB ) languished , stigmatized by the perception that it represented an effort to control people 's minds and thoughts .
But more recently , ESB research has once again been flourishing , with reports of researchers creating remote - controlled rats , pigeons , and even sharks .

# 13 : The Ape and the Child History contains a number of accounts of children raised by animals .
The children in such cases often end up behaving more animal than human , even when returned to human society .
This made the psychologist Winthrop Kellogg wondered what would happen if the situation were reversed .
What if an animal were raised by humans as a human ?
Would it eventually act like a human ?
To answer this question , in 1931 Kellogg brought a seven - month - old female chimpanzee named Gua into his home .
He and his wife then proceeded to raise her as if she were human , treating her exactly the same as they treated their ten - month - old son Donald .
Donald and Gua played together .
They were fed together .
And the Kelloggs subjected them both to regular tests to track their development .
One such test was the suspended cookie test , in which the Kelloggs timed how long it took their children to reach a cookie suspended by a string in the middle of the room .
Gua regularly performed better on such tests than Donald , but in terms of language acquisition she was a disappointment .
Despite the Kelloggs 's repeated efforts , the ability to speak eluded her .
Disturbingly , it also seemed to be eluding Donald .
Nine months into the experiment , his language skills were n't much better than Gua's .
When he one day indicated he was hungry by imitating Gua's " food bark , " the Kelloggs decided the experiment had gone far enough .
Donald evidently needed some playmates of his own species .
So on March 28 , 1932 they shipped Gua back to the primate center .
She died a year - and - a - half later of fever .

# 14 : “ My Fingernails Taste Terribly Bitter ”
In the summer of 1942 , Professor Lawrence Leshan stood in the darkness of a cabin in an upstate New York camp where a row of young boys lay sleeping .
He spoke aloud , repeating a single phrase over and over : " My fingernails taste terribly bitter .
My fingernails taste terribly bitter . "
Leshan was n't mad .
He was conducting a sleep - learning experiment .
All the boys had been diagnosed as chronic nail - biters , and Leshan wanted to find out if nocturnal exposure to a negative suggestion about nail biting would cure them of their bad habit .
Leshan initially used a phonograph to play the message .
It faithfully repeated the phrase 300 times a night as the boys lay sleeping .
But five weeks into the experiment , the phonograph broke .
Leshan improvised by standing in the darkness and speaking the message himself .
At the end of the summer , Leshan examined the boys ' nails and concluded that 40 % of them had kicked the habit .
The sleep - learning effect seemed to be real .
However , other researchers later disputed this conclusion .
In a 1956 experiment at Santa Monica College , William Emmons and Charles Simon used an electroencephalograph to make sure subjects were fully asleep before playing a message .
Under these conditions , the sleep - learning effect disappeared .

# 15 : The Electrification of Human Corpses
In 1780 , the Italian anatomy professor Luigi Galvani discovered that a spark of electricity could cause the limbs of a dead frog to twitch .
Soon men of science throughout Europe were repeating his experiment , but it did n't take them long to bore of frogs and turn their attention to more interesting animals .
For instance , they wondered what would happen if you electrified a human corpse .
Galvani's nephew , Giovanni Aldini , embarked on a tour of Europe in which he offered audiences the chance to see this stomach - turning spectacle .
His most celebrated demonstration occurred on January 17 , 1803 when he applied the poles of a 120 - volt battery to the body of the executed murderer George Forster .
When Aldini placed wires on the mouth and ear , the jaw muscles quivered and the murderer 's features twisted in a rictus of pain .
The left eye opened as if to gaze upon his torturer .
For the grand finale Aldini hooked one wire to the ear and plunged the other up the rectum .
Forster 's corpse broke into a hideous dance .
The London Times wrote , " It appeared to the uninformed part of the bystanders as if the wretched man was on the eve of being restored to life . "
Other researchers tried electrifying corpses with the hope of restoring them to life , but with no success .
Early nineteenth - century experiments of this kind are considered to have been one of Mary Shelley 's main sources of inspiration when she wrote her novel Frankenstein in 1816 .

# 16 : Seeing Through a Cat ’s Eyes In 1999 researchers led by Dr. Yang Dan , an assistant professor of neurobiology at the University of California , Berkeley , anesthetized a cat with sodium pentothal , chemically paralyzed it with Norcuron , and secured it tightly in a surgical frame .
They then glued metal posts to the whites of its eyes , and forced it to look a screen that showed scene after scene of swaying trees and turtleneck - wearing men .
This was n't a form of Clockword - Orange - style aversion therapy for cats .
Instead , it was an attempt to tap into another creature 's brain and see directly through its eyes .
The researchers had inserted fiber electrodes into the vision - processing center of the cat 's brain .
The electrodes measured the electrical activity of the brain cells and transmitted this information to a nearby computer which decoded the information and transformed it into a visual image .
As the cat watched the images of the trees and the turtleneck - wearing guy , the same images emerged ( slightly blurrier ) on the computer screen across the room .
The researchers suggested that the picture quality could be improved in future experiments by measuring the activity of a larger number of brain cells .

# 17 : Stimuli Eliciting Sexual Behavior in Turkeys
Male turkeys are n't fussy .
Give them a lifelike model of a female turkey and they 'll happily try to mate with it as eagerly as they would with the real thing .
This observation intrigued Martin Schein and Edgar Hale of the University of Pennsylvania , and made them curious about what might be the minimal stimulus required to excite a turkey .
They embarked on a series of experiments to find out .
This involved removing parts from the turkey model one by one , until the male turkey eventually lost interest .
Tail , feet , and wings were all removed , but still the male bird waddled up to the model , let out an amorous gobble , and tried to do his thing .
Finally , the researchers were left with a head on a stick .
And surprisingly , the turkey still showed great interest .
In fact , it preferred a head on a stick over a headless body .
Schein and Hale subsequently investigated how minimal they could make the head itself before it failed to elicit a response .
They discovered that freshly severed female heads impaled on sticks worked best , but if the male turkey had nothing else it would settle for a plain balsa wood head .

# 18 : “ Would You Go To Bed With Me Tonight ? ”
Imagine that it 's 1978 , and you 're a young man walking across the campus of Florida State University .
A beautiful female stranger approaches you and says these exact words , " I have been noticing you around campus .
I find you to be attractive .
Would you go to bed with me tonight ? "
If you were that man , you might have thought you had just gotten incredibly lucky .
But not really .
You were actually an unwitting subject in an experiment designed by the psychologist Russell Clark .
Clark had persuaded the students of his social psychology class to help him find out which gender , in a real - life situation , would be more receptive to a sexual offer from a stranger .
The only way to find out , he figured , was to actually get out there and see what would happen .
So young men and women from his class fanned out across campus and began propositioning strangers .
The results were predictable .
Seventy - five percent of guys were happy to oblige an attractive female stranger .
The few who said no typically offered an excuse such as , " I 'm married . "
But not a single woman accepted the identical offer of an attractive male .
In fact , most of them demanded the guy leave her alone .
At first the psychological community dismissed Clark 's experiment as a trivial stunt , but gradually his experiment gained acceptance , and eventually praise for how dramatically it revealed the differing sexual attitudes of men and women .
Today it 's considered a classic .
But why men and women display such different attitudes remains as hotly debated as ever .

# 19 : Shock the Puppy Charles Sheridan and Richard King told their subjects ( undergraduate volunteers from a psychology course )  that a puppy was being trained to distinguish between a flickering and a steady light .
It had to stand in one of two places depending on the cue from the light .
If it failed to stand in the correct place , the subjects were instructed to press a switch to shock it .
The power level increased 15 volts with each successive shock — supposedly testing whether increasing pain would motivate the puppy to learn more quickly .
In reality , this was n't a test of puppy learning .
It was an experiment inspired by Stanley Milgram 's " obedience experiment " of 1963 , which had demonstrated that a majority of people would obediently deliver shocks of increasing intensity to another person , up to a potentially fatal level , at the mere command of a researcher .
Milgram 's victim ( an actor ) had faked his cries of pain , leading some critics to suggest that perhaps the subjects had obeyed the researcher because they realized that the experimental setup was a ruse .
So Sheridan and King had decided to repeat Milgram 's experiment , introducing one signifcant difference .
Instead of using an actor , they would use an actual victim — a puppy — who would really get shocked .
As the voltage increased , the puppy first barked , then jumped up and down , and finally started howling with pain .
The student volunteers were horrified .
They paced back and forth , hyperventilated , and gestured with their hands to show the puppy where to stand .
Many openly wept .
Yet the majority of them , twenty out of twenty - six , kept pushing the shock button right up to the maximum voltage .

# 20 : Heartbeat at Death On October 31 , 1938 , John Deering took a last drag on his cigarette , sat down in a chair , and allowed a prison guard to place a black hood over his head and pin a target to his chest .
Next the guard attached electronic sensors to Deering 's wrists .
Deering had volunteered to participate in an experiment , the first of its kind , to have his heartbeat recorded as he was shot through the chest by a firing squad .
The prison physician , Dr. Stephen Besley , figured that since Deering was being executed anyway , science might as well benefit from the event .
Perhaps some valuable information about the effect of fear on the heart could be learned .
The electrocardiogram immediately disclosed that , despite Deering 's calm exterior , his heart was beating like a jackhammer at 120 beats per minute .
The sheriff gave the order to fire , and Deering 's heartbeat raced up to 180 beats per minute .
Then four bullets ripped into his chest , knocking him back in his chair .
One bullet bore directly into the right side of his heart .
For four seconds his heart spasmed .
A moment later it spasmed again .
Then the rhythm gradually declined until , 15.4 seconds after the first shot , Deering 's heart stopped .
The next day Dr. Besley offered the press a eulogy of sorts for Deering , saying , " He put on a good front .
The electrocardiograph film shows his bold demeanor hid the actual emotions pounding within him .
He was scared to death . "

The 26 Major Advantages to Reading More Books and Why 3 in 4 People Are Being Shut Out of Success
I read a Associated Press - Ipsos poll revealing that 1 in 4 adults read no books last year .
Yes , that ’s 25 % of the adults out there are reading zero books .
This is sad .
I knew intuitively the number of books read each year had gone down but to zero ?
Ridiculous !
And what about the adults who are reading more than zero books a year .
How many are they reading in all ?
One ?
Five ?
Actually , the same poll reveals the average adult reads only four books per year .
Half of those people read less than four .
If you are one of the non -book readers who feels you “ do n’t need no stinking books ” , here are 26 great reasons to start the habit … before you are left behind !
1. Reading is an active mental process – Unlike TV , books make you to use your brain .
By reading , you think more and become smarter .
2 . It is a fundamental skill builder - Every good course on the planet has a matching book to go with it .
Why ?
Because books help clarify difficult subjects .
Books provide information that goes deeper than just classroom discussion .
3 . Improves your vocabulary – Remember in elementary school when you learned how to infer the meaning of one word by reading the context of the other words in the sentence ?
You get the same benefit from book reading .
While reading books , especially challenging ones , you will find yourself exposed to many new words you would n’t be otherwise .
4 . Gives you a glimpse into other cultures and places – What is your favorite vacation spot ?
I would bet you read a lot about that destination .
The more information the better .
Books can expand your horizons by letting you see what other cities and countries have to offer before you visit them .
5 . Improves concentration and focus – Like I pointed out before , reading books takes brain power .
It requires you to focus on what you are reading for long periods .
Unlike magazines , Internet posts or e-Mails that might contain small chunks of information .
Books tell the whole story .
Since you must concentrate in order to read , like a muscle , you will get better at concentration .
6 . Builds self - esteem –
By reading more books , you become better informed and more of an expert on the topics you read about .
This expertise translates into higher self esteem .
Since you are so well read , people look to you for answers .
Your feelings about yourself can only get better .
7. Improves memory – Many studies show if you do n’t use your memory , you lose it .
Crossword puzzles are an example of a word game that staves off Alzheimer ’s .
Reading , although not a game , helps you stretch your memory muscles in a similar way .
Reading requires remembering details , facts and figures and in literature , plot lines , themes and characters .
8 . Improves your discipline – Obviously , if 1 in 4 people do n’t read one book per year , then there is a discipline issue .
There may be many causes for people not reading books such as the “ quips ” of information you can get on the Internet .
TV is also a major distracter .
Making time to read is something we all know we should do , but who schedules book reading time every day ?
Very few …
That ’s why adding book reading to your daily schedule and sticking to it , improves discipline .
9. Learn anywhere – Books are portable .
You can take them almost anywhere .
As such , you can learn almost anywhere too .
10 .
Improves creativity – by reading more books and exposing yourself to new and more complete information , you will also be able to come up with more creative ideas .
As a personal example , I read many , many books on IT Networking .
So often , when IT Admins are stumped with a problem , I can come up with a creative ( smack your head simple ) solution that is n’t written anywhere .
But the reason I can do that is because I have read so many books on the subject , I can combine lessons from all of them into new solutions .
11 . Gives you something to talk about – Have you ever run out of stuff to talk about with your best friend , wife or husband ?
This can be uncomfortable .
It might even make married couples wonder if their marriage is in trouble .
However , if you read a lot of books , you ’ll always have something to talk about .
You can discuss various plots in the novels you read , you can discuss the stuff you are learning in the business books you are reading as well .
The possibilities of sharing are endless .
12 . Books are inexpensive entertainment –
What ’s the average price of a movie ticket these days ?
$ 8 – $ 10 ?
You can buy a paperback for that price and be entertained for many hours more .
If you have a used bookstore nearby , you can get them even cheaper .
Tip :
Once you make reading a habit , you ’ll enjoy reading the books in your chosen career as well .
13 .
You can learn at your own pace –
Where formal education requires time commitments , books have no late - bells or hourly commitments .
So you can learn at your own pace when you read books .
14 . New mental associations – I touched on this above .
As you read more books the depth and breadth of your knowledge expands and your ability to form new associations increases .
In reading a book to discover the solution to one problem , you find the solution to others you may not have considered .
15 . Improves your reasoning skills – Books for professionals contain arguments for or against the actions within .
A book on cooking argues that Chili powder goes well with beef and goes poorly with ice - cream .
A book on building a business argues that testing an idea for profitability before setting up is a smart strategy and argues against just barreling forward with the idea without testing .
You too will be able to reason better with the knowledge you gain .
Some of the arguments will rub off on you .
Others you will argue against .
Regardless , you ’ll be reasoning better .
16 . Builds your expertise – Brian Tracy has said one way to become an expert in your chosen field is to read 100 books on the subject .
He also said by continuing the same for 5 years you ’ll become an international expert .
With the Internet and blogs , you could hone that time down to 2 - 3 years if you follow through .
17 . Saves money – Apart from saving money on entertainment expenses .
Reading books that help you develop your skills saves money .
Reading books on how someone went bankrupt will be a warning to you against repeating their mistakes .
Reading a book on how to build your own backyard deck saves the expense of hiring a contractor .
18 . Decreases mistakes – Although I would never suggest putting off an important goal because you fear making mistakes , it is still important to sharpen the saw ( link to A.L. post ) .
When you gather the deep and wide wisdom that books can provide , you are less apt to make mistakes .
19 .
You ’ll discover surprises -
As you read more books as a source of information , you ’ll learn stuff you were n’t looking for .
I ’ve read many great quotes on life and love by reading books on marketing .
I ’ve learned facts about biology from reading about chemistry .
Heck , I ’ve picked up some facts about history while reading about programming .
Since so many subjects intertwine it ’s almost impossible not to learn something other than the book ’s subject .
20 . Decreased boredom –
One of the rules I have is if I am feeling bored , I will pick up a book and start reading .
What I ’ve found by sticking to this is that I become interested in the book ’s subject and stop being bored .
I mean , if you ’re bored anyway , you might as well be reading a good book , right ?
21 . Can change your life –
How many times have you heard of a book changing someone ’s life ?
For me , it was Your Erroneous Zones ( link ) by Wayne Dyer – which is the first self - development book I read .
It opened my eyes to a whole new way of thinking that was not depressing and dull .
It was the first step in my path of choosing my own life and being free of old habitual thought patterns .
There are many , many other books out there that have a reputation for changing lives including Getting Things Done : The Art of Stress - Free Productivity , Handbook to Higher Consciousness , Atlas Shrugged , A Tree Grows in Brooklyn , Lord of the Rings and Black Boy to name a few .
But you can start in your chosen field and work your way outward .
22 . Can help break a slump – Being in a slump is uncomfortable .
If you are a writer , you call it writer ’s block .
If you are a salesperson , it ’s called – not making a sale in 23 days .
But a slump can be a crossroads .
It might be you are wavering on your commitment to a particular project or ( with marriage ) person .
Or a slump can be simply a lack of new ideas .
Books are a great source of ideas , big and small .
So if you find yourself in a slump , pick a book on the portion of your life you are slump - ing and get to reading !
23 . Reduces stress - Many avid readers ( including me ) unwind by reading .
Compared with the person who gets home from work and immediately turns on the TV news , you are going from work stress to crime stress .
But it ’s not just news .
TV as a source of relaxation is too full of loud commercials and fast moving ( often violent ) images .
If relaxation is something you want , turn off the TV or computer and pick up a book .
24 . Gets you away from digital distractions –
If you , like many others , feel overwhelmed with the flashing lights , beeps , boops and ring - a- dings that burn up our computing lives , then give books a chance .
When you find some good books , you ’ll find yourself drawn into the subject matter .
You ’ll want to spend more time reading .
By spending more time reading books , you ’ll have less time for the plethora of the digital gadgets begging for our attention .
25 .
You ’ll make more money -
If you make a serious effort to read in your chosen career , your expertise in that specialty will increase .
As you become more specialized and learned , you join a smaller group of more qualified people .
By being part of the small few with the highest level knowledge your pay will increase .
It ’s simple supply and demand .
26 .
The book is always better than the movie – except for perhaps No Country for Old Men .
What are some of the most important books you have read ?
What is the title that changed your life ?
If you ’ve found a book that made a major change in how you work , live or love , please tell us about it in the comments below .

Politics is for enablers and TV sitcomers .
It now has nothing to do with anything .
In the early 20th Century , the German people ( for a time ) thought the same thing .
The tsunami of Hitler Nazism was approaching , but they played meaningless political games , thinking they would solve everything .
And the fruit of this Duh - brained silliness was the monstrous 3rd Reich of the 20th Century .
That 's an EXACT parallel with what 's now happening in American .
The dems are the pugs and the pugs are the dems .
End of conversation .
The only quasi political distinction that now means anything is between fascists and liberals , but none of this has anything to do with establishment politics , i.e. , the pugs are the dems and the dems are the pugs .
What 's ACTUALLY happening in our rapidly dying Democratic Republic ( maybe it 's already dead ) is now crystal clear :
The American people are in ultimate conflict with an American version of a neo Nazi Party .
Call this fascism if you wish , but it would be well to remember that another member of the Royal Bush Family , Prescott Bush ( the grandfather of G.W. ) tried to sell America to the Nazis in the 30's .
Historically , the Bush 's and Nazis have always been loving bedfellows .
And one wonders if there 's a swastika or two in those Skull and Bones secret society rooms at Yale -- whose members always included the Bush's .
But did n't the Nazis cease to exist after WW2 ?
Clearly not !
They had pockets all over the planet ( Argentina comes to mind ) in which , like cancer in remission , they kept their satanic flames alive , waiting , waiting , waiting . . .
But waiting for what ?
Waiting for George W. Bush .
Waiting for ANOTHER chance to get a Bush to sell out America .
All that was missing in the year 2000 stolen election was for the fascist thugs of the elites who trashed the election centers to be wearing Nazi brown shirts .
And ever since that date , we have been playing catch up to the " big picture " of what is really happening to our country .
Mostly , we thought it was politics , but then gradually , gradually we began to realize that the elite financed crime that dominated Washington had very little to do with the traditional Republican Party .
No , something else was taking over our country , murdering Mother Nature , bloating the elites , and turning our magnificent Constitution into toilet paper .
And gradually , gradually we began to realize that what was happening was n't politics as usual , no matter how far you pushed the envelope .
So what was ( is ) this NON political " something else " ?
If it 's not the traditional Republican Party of pre year 2000 , than what is it ?
It 's a resurrected version of the Nazi Party !
Period .
Everything else is window dressing .
The M.O. is identical .
Propaganda ( the Judas press ) , probable assassinations , the Bush middle man , the list goes on and on .
And 9/11 ?
Well , according to ALL the polls , most American 's think the Bush / fascist version is b.s. to the skies -- and its historical common knowledge that the textbook Nazi modus operandi was to terrorize the public into thinking that only absolute fascist control of the country would “ protect ” its citizens .
Sound familiar ?
There 's something liberating about seeing that politics is now totally moot .
Hillary Clinton ( the DLC presidential candidate and biological clone of George W. Bush ) will do NOTHING about ANY of this if she 's elected ( God forbid ! ) .
Give us a break -- the woman does n’t even know how to “ spell ” liberal .
No , the game rules have changed 100 %
Our only hope left is that politics - transcending power of the people strategies and passions will save our nation from turning into the first 21st Century Nazi dictatorship .
Politics may still have to be the mechanism , but not ( and never ) establishment politics , which merely distracts us ( like it did the Germans ) from the horror which is stalking our beloved country .
Politics , yes , but not politics as the dog , but politics as the tail .
The dog is the American people and politics must be the obedient tail .
Thus , the ultimate conflict of our lives is between the AMERICAN PEOPLE and the first menacing resurgence of satanic neo Nazism in this century .
And why did the Nazis pick us ?
Ask the Bush Family .
If we ever needed Tiny Tim , we need him now : God bless us all every one .

Taking a page from Nature herself , a team of researchers developed a method to enhance removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and place it in the Earth 's oceans for storage .
Unlike other proposed ocean sequestration processes , the new technology does not make the oceans more acid and may be beneficial to coral reefs .
The process is a manipulation of the natural weathering of volcanic silicate rocks .
Reporting in Environmental Science and Technology , the Harvard and Penn State team explained their method .
" The technology involves selectively removing acid from the ocean in a way that might enable us to turn back the clock on global warming , " says Kurt Zenz House , graduate student in Earth and planetary sciences , Harvard University .
" Essentially , our technology dramatically accelerates a cleaning process that Nature herself uses for greenhouse gas accumulation . "
In natural silicate weathering , carbon dioxide from the atmosphere dissolves in fresh water and forms weak carbonic acid .
As the water percolates through the soil and rocks , the carbonic acid converts to a solution of alkaline carbonate salts .
This water eventually flows into the ocean and increases its alkalinity .
An alkaline ocean can hold dissolved carbon , while an acidic one will release the carbon back into the atmosphere .
The more weathering , the more carbon is transferred to the ocean where some of it eventually becomes part of the sea bottom sediments .
" In the engineered weathering process we have found a way to swap the weak carbonic acid with a much stronger one ( hydrochloric acid ) and thus accelerate the pace to industrial rates , " says House .
The researchers minimize the potential for environmental problems by combining the acid removal with silicate rock weathering mimicking the natural process .
The more alkaline ocean can store carbon as bicarbonate , the most plentiful and innocuous form of carbon in the oceans .
According to House , this would allow removal of excess carbon dioxide from the atmosphere in a matter of decades rather than millennia .
Besides removing the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide from the atmosphere , this technique would counteract the continuing acidification of the oceans that threatens coral reefs and their biological communities .
The technique is adaptable to operation in remote areas on geothermal or natural gas and is global rather than local .
Unlike carbon dioxide scrubbers on power plants , the process can as easily remove naturally generated carbon dioxide as that produced from burning fossil fuel for power .
The researchers , Kurt House ; Daniel P. Schrag , director , Harvard University Center for the Environment and professor of Earth and planetary sciences ; Michael J. Aziz , the Gordon McKay professor of material sciences , all at Harvard University and Kurt House 's brother , Christopher H. House , associate professor of geosciences , Penn State , caution that while they believe their scheme for reducing global warming is achievable , implementation would be ambitious , costly and would carry some environmental risks that require further study .
The process would involve building dozens of facilities similar to large chlorine gas industrial plants , on volcanic rock coasts .
Since the late 1990s , Lauterbach and Snively have been developing a method to make extremely thin polymer layers on surfaces .
The film covering the surface of these metal samples is at least 1,000 times thinner than a human hair .

They said it could n't be done .
And that 's what really motivated UD polymer chemist Chris Snively and Jochen Lauterbach , professor of chemical engineering at UD .
For years , polymer chemistry textbooks have stated that a whole class of little molecules called 1,2 - disubstituted ethylenes could not be transformed into polymers -- the stuff of which plastics and other materials are made .
This photo shows an ultra - thin polymer film of fumaronitrile , which formerly was believed to be ' unpolymerizable , ' on a tantalum foil .
The film is circular due to the shape of the window where ultraviolet light is emitted into the vacuum chamber during the film deposition process .

However , the UD scientists were determined to prove the textbooks wrong .
As a result of their persistence , the researchers have discovered a new class of ultra - thin polymer films with potential applications ranging from coating tiny microelectronic devices to plastic solar cells .
The discovery was reported as a " communication to the editor " in the Nov. 28 edition of Macromolecules , a scientific journal published by the American Chemical Society .
The research , which also involved doctoral student Seth Washburn , focused on formerly nonpolymerizable ethylenes .
Among them are several compounds that are derived from natural sources , such as cinnamon , and and are FDA - approved for use in fragrances and foods .
One of the compounds is found in milkshakes , according to the scientists .
" There 's been a rule that these molecules would n't polymerize , " Snively , who is a research associate in Lauterbach 's laboratory group , noted .
" When I first saw that in a textbook when I was in graduate school , I said to myself , ' Do n't tell me I can't do this . ' "
And thus , the quest to disprove a widely accepted scientific rule of thumb began .
Polymerization is a chemical reaction in which monomers , which are small molecules with repeating structural units , join together to form a long chain - like molecule - - a polymer .
Each polymer typically consists of 1,000 or more of these monomer " building blocks . "
There are lots of natural polymers in the world , ranging from the DNA in our bodies to chewing gum .
Plastics , of course , are one of the most common groups of manmade polymers .
These synthetic materials first came on the scene in the mid-1800s and are found today in a wide range of applications , including foam drinking cups , carpet fibers , epoxy and PVC pipes .
Since the late 1990s , Lauterbach and Snively have been developing a method to make extremely thin polymer layers on surfaces .
These nanofilms -- at least 1,000 times thinner than a human hair -- are becoming increasingly important as coatings for optics , solar cells , electrical insulators , advanced sensors and numerous other applications .
Formerly , to make a pound of polymer , scientists would take a monomer and a solvent and subject them to heat or light .
Recently , Lauterbach and Snively developed a new polymer - making technique that eliminates the need for a solvent .
Their deposition - polymerization ( DP ) process takes place in a vacuum chamber , where the air is pumped out and the pressure is similar to outer space .
The material to be coated , such as a piece of metal , is placed in the chamber , and the metal is cooled below the monomer 's freezing point , which causes the monomer vapor to condense on the metal .
Then the resulting film is exposed to ultraviolet light to initiate polymerization .
The two - step process allows for the formation of uniform , defect - free films with thicknesses that can be controlled to within billionths of a meter .
The process is fairly " green , " in that not only are no solvents used , but there also is very low energy consumption using this method , according to Lauterbach .
" You also can do photolithography with it , " he said , meaning that the polymer will appear only where the light hits the monomer film .
While their polymerization technique was reported a few years ago , the class of materials the UD scientists have applied it to lately is new and unique .
" We can make nanometer - thick films , but we can't make a gram of the material yet , " Snively noted .
" We 're working on ways to scale up the process . "
The scientists also want to find out if the materials may be stronger , tougher or possess unique properties compared to other polymers .
" It 's exciting because you do n't really know what all their properties are yet , " Snively said .
As for all the potential applications , Lauterbach said , " we 're kind of in the discovery phase , looking to see where all these materials could be used . "
The scientists say their collaboration has been so productive not just because their personalities mesh but because knowledge in each of their respective disciplines is essential to solving the scientific questions they seek to answer .
" We get more done together than either of us could alone , " Lauterbach says .
Lauterbach has a doctorate in physical chemistry from the Free University of Berlin and the Fritz - Haber Institute of the Max Planck Society , and a bachelor 's degree in physics from the University of Bayreuth , Germany .
Snively , a research assistant professor in the materials science and engineering department , has a doctorate in macromolecular science from Case Western Reserve University .
The two scientists came to UD in 2002 from Purdue University , where Lauterbach won the National Science Foundation 's prestigious Faculty Early Career Development Award , as well as Union Carbide 's Innovation Recognition Award .
Soon , the UD researchers may be applying the new class of polymers they 've discovered to plastic solar cells through collaborative research in UD 's new Sustainable Energy from Solar Hydrogen program .
This effort , which focuses on transforming UD graduate students into " energy experts " through interdisciplinary ,
problem - based research , is supported by a five - year , $ 3.1 million grant from the National Science Foundation 's Integrative Graduate Education and Research Training ( IGERT ) program .
UD 's program , which began this fall , includes students and faculty from electrical and computer engineering , mechanical engineering , chemical engineering , materials science , chemistry , physics , economics and policy .
" We 're looking forward to participating with our students in that program , " Lauterbach said .
And until the current polymer textbooks are revised , Lauterbach and Snively also will take great relish when they ask their students to make note of a change in the margins .
" Right now , the excitement for us is that we 've proven textbooks wrong , " Lauterbach said .

Homosexuality remains taboo across most of Africa
The Interfaith Rainbow Coalition Against Homosexuality said the rally at a sports stadium in Kampala showed how much Ugandans deplored homosexuality .
Spokesman Pastor Martin Sempa said that Uganda was under " great external pressure to relax its laws " ahead of November 's Commonwealth summit .
In Uganda , homosexuality carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment .
We are telling them that Africans find homosexuality reprehensible
Pastor Martin Sempa
Does sexual orientation matter ?
Pastor Sempa told the BBC's Focus on Africa that homosexuals were using the summit to try and " shame , force , coerce , intimidate Uganda into changing our laws " .
" We are telling them that Africans find homosexuality reprehensible .
Leave us alone . "
The gay community is estimated by activists to number 500,000 in Uganda where they face much discrimination .
Gay activists held a news conference last week but many were afraid to show their faces and wore masks .
They say they are forced to live double lives for fear of harassment and brutality .
Uganda 's government rejected their call for recognition and equal rights .
ISRAEL has warned Iran to either co-operate with the West over its uranium enrichment program or face military action .
Ron Prosor , Israel 's newly appointed ambassador to Britain and one of his country 's leading experts on Iran 's nuclear program , said that Tehran could enrich enough uranium to make an atomic bomb by 2009 .
" At the current rate of progress , Iran will reach the technical threshold for producing fissile material by 2009 , " he said .
" This is a global threat and it requires a global response .
" It should be made clear that if Iran does not co-operate , then military confrontation is inevitable .
It is either co-operation or confrontation . "

Why Kucinich And Not Ron Paul
Ron Paul does n’t support impeachment .
Dennis Kucinich sponsored legislation for impeachment .
Ron Paul does n’t support 911 Truth and even worse implies that the government ’s version of 911 is true .
Dennis Kucinich supports investigating 911 .
Dennis Kucinich supports not - for - profit healthcare .
Paul supports free market healthcare based on the ability to pay .
Ron Paul wants to eliminate all federal taxation .
Dennis Kucinich wants to shift the tax burden to wealthy persons and corporations .
Ron Paul supports the neoliberal free market agenda of free trade , deregulation of business , and privatization of public assets .
Dennis Kucinich supports fair trade .
Ron Paul falsely claims that lower taxes benefit all of us but this is false because different types of taxes affect different portions of the population .
If you lower a regressive tax like the payroll tax then it benefits the poor and middle classes but not the wealthy .
If you lower a progressive tax like a tax on corporate profits , capital gains tax , or federal estate tax then this benefits wealthy individuals and corporations but not the poor and middle classes .
Paul also falsely states that lower taxes create jobs which is that trickle down economics crap that Ronald Reagan promoted which proved to be false .
Paul also states that lower taxes allow us to make more decisions for ourselves about our lives which is only true if he ’s talking about regressive taxes that affect the poor and middle classes .
Paul also falsely implies that all we have to do is cut spending and we”ll avoid economic disaster .
Ron Paul also wants to deport every single undocumented immigrant .
Paul shamelessly exploits 911 for his anti-immigrant agenda when he says a number of 9/11 terrorists had expired visas when he knows full well there were no 911 terrorists and that the attack was really a controlled demolition .
Kucinich wants to grant permanent legal residence to immigrants living in the US for 5 or more years and conditional legal status and work authorization to all law abiding immigrants living in the US for less than 5 years .
Ron Paul opposes the International Criminal Court where he justifies it by saying the ICC wants to try our soldiers as war criminals and that they are a threat to our independence as a nation .
Well I say if our soldiers commit war crimes then they should be prosecuted as war criminals .
The ICC is no threat to our independence as a nation .
The only reason for anyone to oppose the ICC is to prevent international criminals from being brought to justice .
Paul falsely claims that the jihadists are our direct enemies .
Paul also falsely claims that our reason for going to war was a UN resolution .
The UN had nothing to do with why our country went to war .
Oil is the reason why our country went to war but Paul does n’t mention this and instead blames the UN to support his anti-UN agenda .
Paul is also an anti-abortion fanatic .
Paul wants to redefine life as beginning at conception .
I guess he wants to throw any woman who has an abortion in jail .
Paul also wants to overturn Roe vs Wade .
Paul claims federal court tyranny has caused the deaths of 45 million of the unborn .
His statement is an oxymoron .
You ca n’t die if you ’ve never been born .
Paul is trying to impose his religious beliefs on those who do n’t share them .
Kucinich used to be against a woman ’s right to have an abortion but his views on the issue changed several years ago and now he ’s a strong defender of a woman ’s right to choose .
Kucinich discusses 88 different issues on his website .
Paul only discusses 10 topics on his website .
" You will notice that the calculator beeps whenever you get close to metal .
It beeps even faster the closer you get to the metal . "
This was my first clue that this makes no sense at all .
What would possibly induce the calculator to beep in the presence of a metal .
Surely it would do so whether it had a radio strapped to its back or not .
Never seen one do that yet .
If it worked at all it would have to relate to signal strength received by the radio due to reflection or eddy current losses as the radiated noise approaches the metal .
Then maybe there would be a barely audible change .
It would be nice if there was some Beat Frequency or Heterodyne effect , but since the radio is not " Tuned " to the calculator 's oscillator or any thing like that this is unlikely .
This does appear to happen when buttons are pressed as has been mentioned by others , and that is not a surprise .
B.S? I think so .

MITT ROMNEY said he did not feel it was dignified for presidential candidates to take questions from a snowman .
Nonetheless , the Republican candidates for the presidency eventually agreed to face a YouTube debate , in which ordinary voters recorded questions on video and submitted them for broadcast to the candidates .
None of the questions aired on the evening of Wednesday November 28th were quite as ridiculous as the snowman who asked Democrats about global warming in the other party 's YouTube debate .
But the questions , and answers , this time reflected much about the state of the Republican party heading into next year 's election .
It is not known how exactly the producers of CNN , which co-sponsored the debate , chose which YouTube clips to show to the aspiring candidates .
But the first half - hour of the debate , the longest dedicated to any single issue , focused on immigration .
The subject is one of the most potent topics for Republicans .
CNN asked a panel of undecided voters to turn up a dial when they heard things that pleased them : the broadcaster noted spikes of approval when the candidates talked tough on borders .
The harshest and longest exchange of the evening came between Rudy Giuliani , the national front - runner , and Mr Romney , who has nudged ahead in the crucial early polls in Iowa and New Hampshire .
Mr Giuliani is trying to shake a reputation that he was easy on illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York .
He attacked Mr Romney , accusing the former Massachusetts governor of hiring illegal immigrants to work on his house .
The two sparred particularly fiercely as questioners asked if any candidate would support an “ amnesty ” ( giving illegals a regular status and the possibility of citizenship ) .
Minor candidates like Duncan Hunter , a Californian congressman , and Tom Tancredo , a congressman from Colorado , managed to get digs in on the subject .
Neither man has a prayer at the nomination , but both remain in the race perhaps because they started beating the immigration drum earlier and harder than others .
At least on immigration the candidates , broadly , share the same views : tougher borders , intolerance for illegal migrants .
This topic , along with fears of toxic toys from China or other worries about the outside world , helps Republicans forget , or minimise , the divisions between libertarians and Christian conservatives .
But the debate grew distinctly awkward when other topics were raised .
Mr Giuliani was asked why he had supported gun control in the past .
John McCain and Mr Romney debated whether waterboarding should be considered as torture .
One questioner asked if the candidates believed every word of the Bible .
This led Mr Giuliani to stumble towards the position that while the Bible was his favourite book , he perhaps did not literally believe in the story of Jonah and the whale .
Another questioner asked whether Jesus would support the death penalty .
Mike Huckabee — now , against all expectations , in first place in a recent poll from Iowa thanks to his longstanding Christian conservatism — said that the death penalty was painful but necessary .
When pressed whether Jesus would be in favour , he got a laugh saying Jesus was too smart to run for office .
The race remains unusually wide open .
Mr Huckabee 's surge in Iowa coincides with the libertarian Ron Paul 's recent fundraising feats and his hooting cheers at Wednesday 's debate .
These two have surged from the bottom because the party 's two wings cannot yet agree on one of the better - known and more traditional candidates .
In 1980 and 2000 , a candidate united the party early and convincingly with a winning message about America 's greatness and winks to both of the party 's wings .
This time the party is divided and the outcome is far from clear .
There is much discussion in the blogosphere about Senator Chuck Hagel ’s interview in Esquire where he speculates about the possibility of President Bush ’s impeachment :
“ The president says , ‘ I do n’t care . ’
He ’s not accountable anymore , ” Hagel says , measuring his words by the syllable and his syllables almost by the letter .
“ He ’s not accountable anymore , which is n’t totally true .
You can impeach him , and before this is over , you might see calls for his impeachment .
I do n’t know .
It depends how this goes . ”
The conversation beaches itself for a moment on that word — impeachment — spoken by a conservative Republican from a safe Senate seat in a reddish state .
It ’s barely even whispered among the serious set in Washington , and it rings like a gong in the middle of the sentence , even though it flowed quite naturally out of the conversation he was having about how everybody had abandoned their responsibility to the country , and now there was a war going bad because of it .
“ Congress abdicated its oversight responsibility , ” he says .
“ The press abdicated its responsibility , and the American people abdicated their responsibilities .
Terror was on the minds of everyone , and nobody questioned anything , quite frankly . ”
All of this is true .
Grave mistakes were made on both sides of the political aisle that have plunged America , and the rest of the world , into a situation that seems to be without an easy solution right now .
But that ’s not a ground for impeachment .
Here ’s what Article II says :
The President , Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States , shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for , and Conviction of , Treason , Bribery , or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors .
It is without question that profound policy mistakes have been made by the Bush Administration , especially when it comes to the Iraq War .
They relied on faulty intelligence , ignored evidence that did n’t conform to their predetermined conclusions , and started a war without planning what would happen after it was over .
We have paid the price for those mistakes for four years now .
But ….
Making bad policy decisions is not a ground for impeachment under the Constitution .
Turning the impeachment power into a method of removing from office a President who is merely unpopular would , I think , be a grave mistake .

103 - year - old chemical reaction pops up again .
Annulenes are common ; but replacing carbon with nitrogen in a 12 - membered ring might be harder than thought .
LAGUNA DESIGN / SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY
There was something strangely familiar about results published in two high - profile chemistry journals recently : as one researcher has since pointed out , they accidentally replicated an experiment that was done more than a century ago .
The resulting ruckus has highlighted how accidental chemical conclusions can get past peer review , and stands as a reminder of how easy it is to miss similarities to old results .
The results were those from two groups who claimed to have made an unusual organic compound : a 12 - membered nitrogen - containing ring of a class of molecules called annulenes .
This chunky compound , they said , would have special properties and could be useful as a surfactant , among other things .
One paper was published in 20061 ; the second builds on it , and was published this year2 .
But when Manfred Christl , a chemist at the University of Würzburg , read the papers he recognized the reaction conditions as those used some 103 years earlier by German chemist Theodor Zincke , in a reaction that took his name3 .
That reaction creates a salt half as big as the claimed annulene ring ( the annulene ring is a ‘ dimer ’ or double - molecule version of the monomer salt ) .
Christl got in touch with the authors to let them know his thoughts .
Since then , Isao Yamaguchi , at Shimane University , Japan , and colleagues have retracted their work in Organic Letters4 .
“ I reflect that I lacked a knowledge about the reaction pointed out by Dr Christl , ” says Yamaguchi .
“ It ’s good for older folk to point out to us young punks that ‘ you need to do your homework better ’ . ”
Michael Haley
Fredric Menger at Emory University in Atlanta , Georgia , and colleagues say a correction will be published for their paper , published in Angewandte Chemie in August .
In Menger ’s case , the mistake arose partly because of an effect that happens with mass spectrometry ( MS ) — a technique used to determine the mass of a molecule .
“ Our MS mass was twice that of the monomer because , apparently , dimers form in the gas phase of the mass spectrometer , a point that we did not realize at the time , ” says Menger .
Christl 's own notes are also published in Angewandte Chemie5 .
Whoops
It is not unusual for scientists to retract results .
The most recent , high - profile case in chemistry was in March 2006 , when Dalibor Sames , a chemist at Columbia University , New York , retracted six full papers because a number of results about C–H bonds produced by one of his graduate students could not be reproduced .
But the Menger / Yamaguchi case highlights another problem – lack of knowledge of old literature .
“ We are so reliant on electronic databases nowadays , I bet there are many current students that have no idea that the print version of Chemical Abstracts [ a database of all chemical reactions ever published ] even exists , ” says Michael Haley , a chemist at the University of Oregon , Eugene .
“ It ’s good for older folk to point out to us young punks that ‘ you need to do your homework better ’ , ” he says .
“ I am sure this happens a lot and is probably becoming increasingly common as we fail to keep up with the literature , ” agrees Andrew Holmes of Melbourne University , Australia , who worked with annulenes as a graduate student and was forced to retract a paper of his own in 1996 after being unable to reproduce results .
Christl also criticizes the peer - review process that let both Yamaguchi's and Menger 's papers be published in the first place ; he bemoans the lack of time that people have to do a thorough job .
“ Reading the literature is a luxury that not many respected scientists can allow themselves anymore , ” he says .

Haley sees this episode as a useful warning to scientists : “ referees need to do their job and examine manuscripts carefully , ” he says .
“ It ’s a good call to arms , a warning sign . ”
Menger adds there is much in his paper that is correct and useful ; the theoretical work on the structure of 12 - membered annulene is still valid and the compounds he made are still useful surfactants , he notes .
His research will not be affected , he says , except “ we will probably be more careful in the future combing the ancient literature . ”
It is clear now that George Bush and Dick Cheney have been pushing hard for war with Iran for months , all the while knowing -- and trying desperately to hide the fact from the public -- that the entire US intelligence community had established with a high degree of confidence that Iran poses no threat of becoming a nuclear power , and that it is not playing any significant role in Iraqi attacks on American troops in Iraq .
They were , to put it simply , lying and scheming .
It is also well known that Cheney actually slinked behind the State Department 's back earlier this fall and tried , on his own , to talk the Israelis into attacking Iran 's nuclear facilities in hopes of getting Iran to retaliate and thus drag the US into a war with Tehran .
These are acts not of policy but of treason .
But aside from Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) and a group of fewer than 25 backers , you do n't hear any calls from the Congress for impeachment .
And Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the rest of the Democratic Party leadership are busy squelching any such talk .
We now know too that the White House , including key legal aides Alberto Gonzales , David Addington , Harriet Myers and John Bellinger III , were counselling the CIA as late as 2005 , either overtly or by a wink and a nod , to destroy video tapes depicting torture by the CIA , even after several federal courts had ordered the production of such tapes .
As well , we have learned from former White House Press Secretary Scott McClellan that Bush and Cheney and their top aides also orchestrated a cover-up of the Cheney conspiracy to out a key CIA undercover operative specializing in the monitoring of nuclear proliferation .
That would be Valerie Plame .
These are both clear cases of conspiracy to obstruct justice and of actual obstruction of justice ( two of the charges that were voted by the House impeachment panel against Richard Nixon ) , but aside from Reps.
Robert Wexler ( D - FL ) , Luis Gutierrez ( D - IL ) and Tammy Baldwin ( D - WI ) , there has been no Congressional call for impeachment hearings for these grave crimes .
The president continues to brazenly refuse to enact and enforce laws passed by the Congress , and to willfully violate others , most recently asserting that he has the power to take money authorized by Congress for one military purpose and shift it to another ( something he already did to terrible effect illegally back in 2001 when he withdrew money voted to fund the assault on Al Qaeda in Afghanistan and shifted it to a future war he was planning against Iraq ) .
Although the president 's assertion of a heretofore unheard - of , non-existent , and purely un-Constitutional " unitary executive " authority to ignore both Congress and the Courts fatally undermines the whole founding principle of checks and balances built into the government as constructed by the authors of the Constitution , and although his actions turn Congress into nothing more than a debating club , there has been no call from Congress for the president 's impeachment .
And as the President and Vice President and their key staffmembers have simply thumbed their noses at investigation after investigation by committees in the House and Senate , even when those committees issue subpoenas , with the president going so far as to say he would instruct his attorney general not to allow the US attorney in Washington to enforce those subpoenas against his staff , thus proving the impotence of Congress and the futility of a policy of " investigations , " there has been no cry from Congress for impeachment .
Yet this is clearly the only way to effectively conduct those investigations in the face of such intransigence and abuse of power .
Confronted with all these , and with other frontal assaults on American democracy and the Constitution , Congress is behaving as if everything is normal , aided by a national corporate media which simply do not report on the constitutional damage that is being done by this inaction and by the White House 's behavior .
Instead of action on impeachment , we have the pathetic spectacle of the Congress calling for a major investigation into , what ?
Steroid use by American professional athletes !
And that does get media coverage !
I will pause here to give you , the dear reader , a chance to either laugh uproariously or to retch uncontrollably - - your , or your body 's , choice .
Done ?
Okay , so what do we do ?
Clearly the Democrats are a bunch of gutless buffoons unworthy of anyone 's vote next fall .
They have demonstrated that they have n't the political sense of a donkey or the will of a jellyfish , and if left in control of the House and Senate , will continue to allow the growth of unfettered executive power next year , whether under a Democratic or Republican president .
My own representative , two - term Democrat Allyson Schwartz , does n't even talk about the administration 's constitutional crimes .
She 's on and on about " tax relief for the middle class " without even mentioning the president 's collosal waste of $ 500 billion -- actually several trillion dollars counting interest and future costs for care of the injured -- caused by the illegal and disastrous Iraq war .
The only answer left to us is to throw them all out .
This year , only candidates who are committed to impeachment , and to a reassertion of the Constitution as the law of the land deserve to be returned to or elected to Congress .
If that means voting for a Republican , vote for the Republican .
If it means voting third party or write - in in your district , then do that .
If we do not stop the cancer of dictatorship that is growing in Washington now , we will end up having to restore popular government by force later , under much worse circumstances .
And I 'l reiterate my call for progressive people in towns across the nation who are registered Democrats to organize mass marches from some symbolic point -- say a war memorial , or a library -- to the local board of elections to have mass de-registrations from the Democratic Party - - marches that should be announced to the local media in advance ( especially Fox , which will love reporting on them ) .
These actions , if they snowball , will scare the crap out of Democratic Party leaders , and if people make it clear they are quitting the party unless it acts to end funding for the Iraq War , and unless it begins impeachment proceedings , I 'm confident , we 'll see those things happen .
The time for grumbling about Democrats and then just voting like sheep is over .

Democrats fail to prevent Senate condemnation of MoveOn ad Nick Juliano

The Senate voted by a wide margin Thursday to condemn a controversial anti-war advertisement accusing Gen. David Petraeus of betraying the country .
Only 24 Democrats , including presidential candidate Hillary Clinton , voted against the symbolic resolution .
Sen. Barack Obama ( D - IL ) and Sen. Joe Biden ( D - DE ) , both of whom also are seeking their party 's presidential nomination , joined Sen. Maria Cantwell ( D - WA ) in declining to take a position for or against the MoveOn ad .
Since last Monday , when the " General Petraus or General Betray Us ? " ad ran on a full page of the New York Times , Republicans have launched relentless attacks on MoveOn and any Democrats who refused to outright condemn the ad's message .
" The focus of the United States Senate should be on ending this war , not on criticizing newspaper advertisements , " Obama said .
" This amendment was a stunt designed only to score cheap political points while what we should be doing is focusing on the deadly serious challenge we face in Iraq .
It 's precisely this kind of political game - playing that makes most Americans cynical about Washington 's ability to solve America 's problems .
By not casting a vote , I registered my protest against this empty politics .
I registered my views on the ad itself the day it appeared . "
In a statement released Thursday Obama continued , " All of us respect the service of General Petraeus and all of our brave men and women in uniform .
The way to honor that service is to give them a mission that is responsible , not to vote on amendments like the Cornyn amendment while we continue to pursue the wrong policy in Iraq . "
President Bush entered the fray himself Thursday , calling the ad " disgusting " and an attack on the military .
Sen. Gordon Smith , a Republican who favors a timetable for removing US troops from Iraq , blamed the MoveOn ad for keeping Republicans aligned with the White House in voting against measures to de-escalate the war .
" It was stupid on their part and disgraceful , " the Oregon Republican told the Associated Press .
Thursday 's Senate resolution was sponsored by conservative Sen. John Cornyn ( R - TX ) .
who took time away from questioning Petraeus to condemn the ad as " reprehensible slander " during a Senate hearing last Tuesday .
Earlier Thursday Sen. Barbara Boxer ( D - CA ) introduced a resolution that would 've condemned all attacks on troops and veterans , including those from MoveOn and conservative groups that disparaged former Sen Max Cleland and John Kerry in 2002 and 2004 .
That resolution fell nine short of the 60 votes needed to end debate on it .
Obama voted in favor of that measure , an hour before the vote on Cornyn 's bill he skipped .
In substantive votes Thursday , Democrats failed to attract enough Republican supporters to end a filibuster on Sen.
Jim Webb 's amendment to a defense spending bill that would have given US troops as much time at home as they are stationed in a warzone .
Currently some troops are subject to 15 - month tours of duty with only a year off in between .
Webb was among the Democrats who supported the measure condemning MoveOn .

A while back I recommended ten books I thought were fairly good / essential reading for programmers .
They 're all fairly basic material ; the only one that 's even moderately challenging is the Algorithm Design Manual .
And that one 's not too bad .
I thought I 'd talk about some other books I 'm in the process of reading ( and in some cases , struggling through ) .
I have n't finished most of them yet , but they 're all exceptional .
These are books that are important to me .
Not in the Lewis Carroll or Herman Melville sense ; they 're not cherished fictional works , or even fictional works that are just thick enough to prop up the couch .
For the most part they 're technical books .
But each of them is a book that I return to regularly as I try to figure out — well , how stuff " works " .
There are more than ten , obviously , but I decided to cap this list at ten books just to have a shot at finishing this essay before the end of the year .
( Note : it 's now Jan 22nd 2005 , so I did n't make it .
Close , though ! )
Without further ado ...
# 1 : Gödel , Escher , Bach : An Eternal Golden Braid — Douglas R. Hofstadter
This is one of the most beautiful books ever written , and it 's the top of my list .
Sure , it 's incredibly famous and won the Pulitzer Prize the year it was written .
That 's not why you want to read it , though .
It 's a work of art , one written for everyone , but especially for programmers like you and me .
( If you are n't a programmer , make sure to read about book # 10 on the list . )
One interesting tidbit about this book is that few people ever finish it .
Make no mistake : they want to finish it , and they try .
But depending on your tolerance for mind - bending recursive paradoxes , you 're likely to give up anywhere from a third of the way to halfway through .
I did .
I finally managed to read about 2/3 of it over the holidays , and I 'm looking forward to finishing it ... so I suppose the situation has n't really changed .
I 'm still not done .
Even some of my college profs were n't able to finish it .
In fact , I only know one person who has .
He works at Amazon , and it's not who you think it is ( you probably do n't even know him ) .
He 's a smart dude .
But then , he was a smart dude back when he was a grad student writing the backend for the compiler that we were struggling with writing the frontend for in our compilers class .
Very smart .
I love this book .
Everyone loves this book .
We just can't finish it !
It 's too much , too rich .
It 's like trying to eat a molten chocolate fudge cake the size of a minivan .
I 've seen TV shows where people were in ice - cream eating competitions , and they'd eat ice cream until they had to yak in a bucket , which is n't unlike reading this book , and you could see they were still eyeing the ice cream afterwards , thinking : " I suppose I could give it another go .
The Romans did it that way , no ? "
The book is pure genius , and a lot of fun .
Not only is it one of the best books on intelligence ( whether real or artificial ) ever written , the book itself is a self - referential fugue in a structural pun on Lewis Carroll .
It really defies description .
You just have to read it , or even a third of it .
I feel like I 'm getting closer and closer to describing this book without ever getting there .
If you know what I mean .
# 2 : Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs — Harold Abelson , Gerald Sussman
This book , often known by its initials ( SICP ) , takes the coveted # 2 spot on my list .
Thanks to Andrew W for mentioning it when commenting on my Ten Great Books entry .
After Andrew 's comment , I quickly went and devoured the book like so much enchanted Turkish Delight .
I could n't get enough of it .
I already owned the book , and I 'd tried reading it , but unfortunately I could n't get past its combination of pomposity and bad jokes .
Imagine a really arrogant , condescending professor who thinks he's hip , and he makes up stories about students named Louis Reasoner or Ima Pseudonym or whatever .
I just could n't stomach it .
But once you get past the tone , it 's a great book .
Great , as in : " It changed the way many schools taught computer science . "
That kind of great .
It 's used for the intro- to - programming course at MIT , and also ( I think ) Berkeley .
Probably other schools as well .
I distinctly remember when I heard the University of Washington was changing their intro- to - programming course again , back in , oh , what was it , 1998 ?
When they switched to Java .
They realized that Ada was n't exactly a cutting - edge programming language anymore , what with Babbage being dead for over a century now .
( Actually , Ada * was * pretty cool , but do n't tell anyone I said that . )
In any case , I remember hearing that one of the languages under consideration for the intro to CS course at UW was Lisp .
" Lisp ! ! ? ? "
I thought .
In fact I think I may have even been verbally and visibly outraged by the idea .
What the heck would they teach newbies Lisp for ?
I know the answer to that question now , and I 'm still basically opposed to using Lisp for the intro-to - CS course at any school , including MIT .
I interview people all the time who took the course , suffered through it , and never could figure out why the heck they were learning such an esoteric language .
New CS students just are n't ready for Lisp .
Most people are never ready for Lisp , just like they 're never ready for math , or philosophy , or any of the human endeavors that will be remembered and cherished by aliens who study our culture after we blow ourselves up .
I sometimes wonder , though : if O'Reilly published a " Lisp Cookbook " , with some giant hideous monster on it ( a Yeti , I 'd hope , or possibly a pterodactyl ) , how many people would start taking it seriously ?
This book is n't an O'Reilly book , though .
It 's from MIT press , like most of the books in this list , so it 's For Smart People Only .
Er , in this case , Smart People who Don't Mind Being Condescended To .
This book covers ... well , everything .
Just like Gödel , Escher , Bach .
I finally learned how Huffman encoding works ( it 's pretty cool ! ) , and the simplicity of Scheme 's metacircular interpreter is just staggering .
The picture language is a thing of beauty , even if MIT 's founder is n't .
The book is stuffed with examples of programs that would be hundreds of lines , if not pages , of Java or C++ code , all written in a tiny amount of Scheme .
Definitely one of my favorites .
Not for new programmers , maybe , but if you 're more like me and Montgomery Burns ( " It 's not how old you are on parchment , it 's how you feel in the humours ! " ) , then I think you 'll really enjoy it .
# 3 : Digital Typography — Donald Knuth
This is a Knuth book .
For most programmers , that means : " It 's by this old Comp Sci guy that everyone raves about but nobody has actually read . "
Am I right , or am I right ?
Donald Knuth , it turns out , is one of the best writers in computer science .
He 's funny .
OK , maybe it 's just me ; maybe I laugh at the jokes of a mathematician , when everyone else would be sighing in disgust .
But I really get a kick out of his books .
When I start reading Knuth , I know I 'm in good hands .
For the recruiting - minded among you , you can check out his resume , or Curriculum Vitae , at his home page at Stanford .
I actually find the idea of Knuth putting his resume online fairly amusing .
I can just imagine the interview :
Donald : Hi , I 'm Donald Knuth , and I was wondering if you have any job openin —
Stevey : Aaaahh !!! < faints >
Donald :
Are n't you going to ask me any technical questions ?
Donald is the best .
Someone the other day said they felt he was a bit on the arrogant side .
Well , ( a) I 've never noticed that myself , although I have n't finished his The Art of Computer Programming yet ( I got it twice for Christmas , if you can believe that .
I 'm so predictable ! ) , and ( b ) regardless , I think Donald has a right to be arrogant .
When you obsolete the printing press , you earn that right , fair and square .
You 're even allowed to wear a t - shirt that reads : " I'm Donald Knuth and You 're Not " .
It 's in the Rules .
But why this book in particular ?
He 's published a ton of stuff .
I 'll be honest : I picked this one in part because it's one of the only Knuth books that I 've come close to finishing .
But I 've been gradually working my way through quite a few of his books , and this one is special .
Extra-special , even .
For one thing , it 's self - referential in a way that even Hofstadter rarely used ; it refers constantly to its own print layout .
And it 's a beautiful book .
After all , it was written entirely using Knuth 's own TeX program .
What 's TeX ?
It 's a deliberate plain - text transliteration of T E X : Donald 's program ( written in Pascal , believe it or not ) for digital typesetting , which allows you to specify how you want your printed material rendered on a printed page , whether it 's online or on a piece of paper .
For another , the book is , well , charming .
Donald 's writing for a 1970 's audience , give or take a decade , and this stuff was breaking new ground , at least for the time .
You have to appreciate the fact that when he published his first two volumes of the Art of Computer Programming , he had to use this giant , steaming - mercury metal monstrosity that might have been more at home in a Stephen King novel in order to print it nicely in book format .
Donald thought : " Hey , I 'm a mathematician and a programmer ; fonts and typesetting seem like they might be algorithmically tractable , so lemme see if I can write a program that will replace the printing press . "
He could , and he did — although it took him about 10 x longer than his initial estimate , as do all the best software programs .
Digital Typography is a set of essays and papers spanning the entire journey , from his realization that you could do fonts and typesetting with computers , up through relatively recent releases of T E X , which is still the premier typesetting system worldwide .
Incidentally , T E X is up to version 3.14159 .
Starting at version 3 , they changed numbering schemes , and each new release adds another digit of π .
For many years Donald has offered a small monetary reward to anyone who finds a bug in T E X ; he even sends you a check , although they 're rarely cashed , since a check from Knuth for finding a bug in T E X is far more valuable as a collectible .
Notice how the previous paragraph 's formatting is all screwed up from the TeX logos , which I faked with a subscripted ' E ' ?
TeX does n't have that problem , of course .
Browsers sure suck , do n't they ?
Hmmmm ...
Maybe Microsoft and Mozilla ought to try to catch up with early - 1970s typesetting and rendering technology , eh ?
Anyway , you should read this book , even if you have no interest in typesetting .
It 'll give you a new appreciation for a lot of things that you probably take for granted .
And it 's just plain fun to read .
Strongly recommended , along with all his other books .
# 4 : Programming Language Pragmatics — Michael Scott
I think this book ( PLP ) is the best general introduction to programming languages you could find .
It 's " sort of " a language - design book , " sort of " a compilers book , " sort of " a lot of things .
It covers dozens of languages in a very practical way , discussing the trade - offs and choices that language designers have made .
The book never claims any one language is " better " than another , which is refreshing .
It just shows what 's easy and what 's hard in each of them .
The book is organized more or less like a textbook on compilers .
It starts with tokenizing , moves on to syntactic analysis , then semantic analysis , runtime organization , code generation , and ( some ) optimization .
It 's a good way to get a detailed feel for how compilers work without actually writing one .
( Note that there 's no substitute for really writing one , but reading this book is the next best thing . )
Unlike most compilers books , PLP talks a lot about why you might make particular decisions in designing a language .
A big problem with many technical manuals ( for any sort of programming activity ) is that they give you a huge list of options , but they do n't give you any guidelines .
This book is about pragmatics , which the author feels is on equal footing with syntax and semantics as one of the central design principles in studying and designing programming languages .
It 's a very practical book .
It 's also very well - written .
Very , very , very .
Unlike many of the books in this list , it 's down - to - earth and written for ordinary mortals like you and me .
It 's also exceptionally well - organized , indexed , and cross - referenced , making it easy to jump around .
I find myself reading it in a very nonlinear way , jumping from section to section as I follow the references .
It has plenty of well - constructed and helpful diagrams , programming exercises at the ends of each chapter , and a zillion references to further reading .
The book basically covers a superset of all the features you might find in a modern programming language .
So reading the book will make it a lot easier to pick up new programming languages , because you 'll already be familiar with the cutting - edge concepts like pattern matching , lazy evaluation , parametric polymorphism , multi-methods , and so on .
And you 'll know how they 're implemented , so you 'll be able to figure out their relative performance trade - offs .
Great book .
Ca n't say enough good things about it .
You can search inside it on Amazon , so I encourage you to take a peek at the layout and writing style .
I think you 'll find it very approachable .
My copy 's getting dog-eared .
# 5 : The Essentials of Programming Languages — Friedman , Wand , Haynes .
I just got this book from Amazon .
It 's from the MIT press , of course , like many of the books in this list .
Daniel Friedman and Matthew Felliesen are two of my Heroes .
No , I 've never met them , any more than I 've met Heracles or Kurt Vonnegut Jr. , but they 're Heroes nonetheless , and virtually everything they 've written , between the two of them , has been something I 've wanted to have — well , bronzed , I guess .
Or etched in stone .
Whatever you do to make a physical copy of a book immortal .
This book is a real treasure , although one that 's not well - understood by our customer reviewers .
I 'd ignore most of the reviews .
( Unless maybe you think " witchkingofangmar " is a reliable reviewer .
Jeez . )
The book builds up essentially all of the fundamental concepts you need in order to understand programming languages ( which , I might add , is a Good Thing if you use them at all ) , implementing them as an increasingly complex ( but never overly difficult ) series of Scheme interpreters .
I stumbled on this book inadvertently , as a reference in a paper that described the algorithm that converts a list comprehension into a series of map and filter statements .
List comprehensions , along with map , filter and their ilk , are really useful abstractions .
It 's worthwhile for you to figure them out , including how they 're implemented by the compiler or runtime .
An interview candidate this morning actually explained to me why he thought they were valuable .
He pointed out ( rightly , I think ) that when you 're working on a particular business problem , you do n't want to be worrying about whether your loop counters start at zero , and end at or below the ending index .
You just want to perform some operation ( e.g. getting the cost , or item details , or whatever ) for every element in a list .
Map does exactly that .
List comprehensions operate at a slightly higher level than Map ; they 're almost like a query language ( in the SQL or XPath sense ) for your data structures .
Very useful .
You say what you want to look for , possibly performing computations on the results as you acquire them , and it all happens " magically " under the hood .
Well , I 'd hope it's not really magic : you should n't use an abstraction unless you understand more or less how it 's implemented , or you can very easily run into performance issues and not know how to debug them .
That 's where this book comes in .
It fills a role very similar to Programming Language Pragmatics , but with a very different exposition .
PLP is more comprehensive , but might seem a bit daunting .
This book , in contrast , covers an important subset of the most common language features , but it shows just how easy they are to implement , at least in Scheme .
I think it 's a great way to play with the algorithms yourself , without worrying too much about those loop counters .
I would not recommend this book unless you 're already pretty familiar with Lisp or Scheme .
This is a pretty advanced text .
# 6 : Types and Programming Languages , Benjamin C. Pierce
There 's a guy on my team who actually used this book as an auxiliary text for one of his CS courses at the University of Washington .
I can't tell you how cool that is .
Well , actually I can : it 's really cool .
This guy is a Smart Dude , sort of on par with the Smart Dude I mentioned earlier who wrote our compilers backend and finished Gödel , Escher Bach back when he was " just " our roommate in college .
This guy is scary - smart .
Like , I study nightly just in case he 'll ask me some horribly complicated programming problem .
He does n't know that though ; do n't tell him or it may go to his head , and he 'll want to be an " architect " , and we 'll never see any work out of him again .
This is the hardest book on the list , and I 've made the least progress into it so far .
However , I think it 's one of the most important .
It 's important because type systems are a critically important part of programming languages — the way you design them , and the way you use them as a programmer .
The book talks about various important type systems , including those of C++ and Java , and what sorts of problems and guarantees you can expect from them .
It spends a lot of time covering the ML type system , which is one of the strongest , most " elegant " type systems out there , and you 'll find more and more books talking about it .
And more and more languages are starting to use it .
It 's considered one of the best type systems in the world , because it gives you a lot of flexibility and Perl - like expressiveness , while maintaining strong compile - time guarantees that you 're not assigning the wrong type of data to a value .
It 's basically the best of the strong - typing and dynamic - typing worlds , because you do n't have to declare most of your type tags .
Interestingly , most programmers do n't ever think much about types .
I ask people in interviews sometimes : " what is a data type ? "
Often they struggle for a long time before coming up with anything even remotely approximating an answer , even a wrong one .
Most people have never thought about it .
At least they 're savvy enough to realize they do n't want to use the word " type " ( or a synonym ) in their definition .
I find it a bit odd when people do n't know how to tell me what a datatype is , because structuring your data types is one of the most fundamental parts of creating a program .
It 's certainly the heart of " object - oriented design " and design patterns .
What classes do you create , and how do they relate and / or communicate with each other ?
What methods and operations do they provide , and what access control do you place on those operations ?
What data types do they accept as arguments ?
How do you marshal a type across a wire ?
These kinds of questions are all tied closely to the type - system that your programming language provides you .
Your choices affect just about every quality measurement of your system : readability , maintainability , robustness , runtime performance , static build times , and so on .
Even if you do n't want to follow the mathematical analysis in this book , it would be a good idea to read through it just for the results .
I.e. it 's not as important to follow the proofs as it is to understand what they 're proving .
Another solid treatment of data types is chapter 7 in Programming Language Pragmatics .
PLP 's discussion far less mathematical in nature , and , well , more pragmatic , as you might expect .
You might start with that book and then move on to this one if you want more detail .
Even though it takes a fairly formal approach , it 's a pretty darn readable book , and is worth taking a look at .
# 7 : The Seasoned Schemer — Daniel P. Friedman , Matthias Felleisen
The Seasoned Schemer is a continuation ( of course ) of its prequel , The Little Schemer , and it , too , features happy elephants on the cover and at the beginning of every chapter .
The authors have another book , quite an amusing one , written in the same question - and - answer style , called A Little Java , A Few Patterns .
I have it on my home bookshelf , which is the shelf you do n't get to see but which contains the books that I Really Care About .
The " Little Java " book is amusing because it tries to introduce exactly the same programming concepts and abstractions as The Little Schemer and The Little MLer , except it tries to do it in Java , which gives it roughly the flavor of Ken Thompson 's Turing Award Speech , in which he says of his Quine competition : " FORTRAN was the language of choice for the same reason that three - legged races are popular . "
( Good speech , by the way . )
The Seasoned Schemer will be a real bear for you if you skipped the last chapter in The Little Schemer .
I did , and had to go back and work through it carefully .
It builds on the work they did to derive the Y - combinator , an important function that bootstraps recursion .
This book is aptly named .
Tough book .
Well worth it , though .
I 'll talk a bit more about why you might want to work your way through it when I talk about book # 8 , below .
# 8 : The Scheme Programming Language — R. Kent Dybvig
Yes , another Lisp book .
It 's also another MIT Press book — they 're sweeping the list today , with well over half the entries .
I 'm putting this book in the list because , once again , it 's one that I have n't quite finished but I revisit it often .
And it gave me some tremendous insights into the languages I use day - to - day : C , Java , Python , Ruby , and so on .
I 'm sure many of you are rolling your eyes in disgust , since we all know Lisp is n't very practical .
If Tim O'Reilly has n't published a book on it yet , then it must not be .
Plus , MIT folks have something of a track record for failing our interviews , because they tend not to know C++ very well .
( That last sentence pains me more than you know . )
So why all my focus on Lisp books ?
The reason Scheme ( a small , pure dialect of Lisp ) gets so much attention in comp - sci programs is that it's an incredibly small language , but it packs a really big whallop .
It 's an easy language to learn — many professors say they can teach the basics of Scheme in a single lecture , and students can immediately start writing programs in it .
But it 's also an easy language to implement .
That 's a really important point .
Sure , it 's also reasonably easy to learn C , but writing a C compiler is a complex task .
Writing a C++ compiler is incredibly hard , and writing a Perl interpreter is actually impossible , because there 's no spec for it , and ( like C++ ) it 's basically un-parseable .
But students regularly write Scheme interpreters as a single project in their undergraduate programming language course .
And Scheme programs are usually shorter than their equivalents in the more complex languages .
Why we go to so much effort to learn languages that are more complex and less expressive with the same performance is beyond me .
It 's probably all those scary parentheses .
As evidence supporting my point about ease of implementation , here 's an example of a small but fairly solid Scheme interpreter written in Java .
( The author , Peter Norvig , also the author of at least one book on Artificial Intelligence , is now the Director of Search Quality at Google .
Ha !
They 'll never be successful now .
He probably does n't even know C++.
He 'd never have made it past Amazon 's brutal hiring bar . )
On the JScheme home page , Peter says that he planned on spending no more than 20 hours total writing the interpreter , which included the time spent learning Java .
He says he succeeded , and looking at the code ( there 's not much of it ! )
I think I believe him .
OK , so Scheme is a small language , and it 's easy to write an interpreter for it .
Easier than it is for almost any other language , even BASIC .
And it 's pretty easy to learn .
So what 's the big deal about it , then ?
The big deal is that you can write complex Scheme programs that are far smaller than their equivalents in Java or C ++.
Scheme may be a small language , but the constructs it provides are amazingly powerful .
The SICP book , for instance , provides a complete implementation of Huffman encoding and decoding in about a page of code .
And the Dyvbig book ( this entry ) provides Scheme code that does some equally amazing things , at least for the size of the code .
Is code compression a good thing ?
After reading a bunch of Paul Graham essays , I was under the impression that he felt compression was the Holy Grail of language ( and program ) design .
I was n't sure I agreed with him , because obviously at some point you 'll get diminishing returns on readability ; in fact you might as well just gzip the code if compression is the most important criterion .
However , searching for the essay above , I typed " paul graham compression " into Google and got this link back , in which someone says exactly the same thing , and they agree that there 's some sort of " best semantic compression " that you can aim for .
And it 's definitely not gzipping the code .
On the other hand , I still think Scheme is fairly " dense " ( as in , almost unreadable ) .
It 's easy enough to write , but following the program is nowhere near as easy as following , say , C ++.
I 'm not sure how much of that is due to my relative unfamiliarity with the language , and how much of it is from the language itself , e.g. lacking type tags and interface signatures .
Data types really help , and in Scheme , there is n't a standard way to create data types from which an automated tool can produce javadoc - like documentation .
Anyway , I could talk all day about the pros and cons of Lisp , of course , but I 'm sure you do n't want to hear it .
I 'm not going to argue that you should write all your code in Scheme , or any of it , for that matter .
It may have some small practical use as the Free Software Foundation 's ( i.e. GNU 's ) new scripting language , Guile Scheme .
In that capacity , it 'll help you with scripting and automating any of your GNU software ( e.g. gcc , gdb , emacs , gimp , etc. ) , especially as more and more GNU tools start incorporating Guile support .
But it 's not likely to be useful to you in many other places .
Like I said in the intro , this list is n't about books that are immediately relevant and practical to you in your everyday work as a programmer .
If nothing else , Scheme has given me a great deal of insight into how more popular languages work .
Languages like Python , Ruby and Groovy are all beginning to incorporate Lisp features ( e.g. first - class continuations , first - class closures , maybe even macros at some point ) , and it helps to understand them in the simplest context of Scheme before trying to use them in more complex languages .
This is a hard book , though , so do n't try to read it in a day .
# 9 : How to Design Programs — Felleisen , Findler , Flatt , Krishnamurthi
This is a fantastic book .
If you 're a programmer , you should definitely not read it .
Yep .
Should not read it .
This book is for non-programmers .
If you 're not a programmer , and you have ever thought about getting into programming , this might just be the way to do it .
It 's not going to be easy , but you 'll be learning programming in its purest form .
This book was written for people who do n't yet know how to program .
Programmers should n't read it because they fall into one of two categories :
Programmers who know Lisp ( or Scheme ) already .
They do n't need this book .
Programmers who do n't know Lisp or Scheme already .
They wo n't understand this book , because they believe programming is all about getting a job , and you only need one language to do that .
If you 're a programmer already , but you do n't know Lisp or Scheme , definitely stay away from this book .
The thesis of the book is that everyone should learn how to program computers .
The authors consider it to be one of the essential skills of an educated person .
It 's the Fourth ' R ' , maybe — a new addition to Readin ' , Ritin ' , and Rithmetic .
This book uses a programming language called Scheme , which is one of the simplest , most powerful languages on the planet .
Programming in Scheme is like speaking eloquent English when all your friends are stuck with one - syllable words ( that would be Java , or Perl , or C++ ) .
Of course , many useful words are only one syllable , with some especially useful ones being four letters long , so people using Java / Perl / C++ are more than equipped to respond to the challenges of the day .
But to say things that are beautiful , you need Scheme , or a similar language .
The book really is targeted at people who 've never written a program before .
I wonder how effective it is ?
If you 're a non-programmer , and you want to give this book a try , I would love to know how it works for you .
There 's a lot of description and very little code ; they try really hard to explain things from the ground up , and they assume little or no computer knowledge on your part .
On the other hand , it 's hard to remember what it was like not to know anything about programming when you 're writing a book like this .
So maybe it 's awful .
If YOU are a person at Amazon who would like to try learning how to program computers , and you get the book and are having trouble with the setup or whatever , let me know and I will be happy to help you .
# 10 : Purely Functional Data Structures
I have n't gotten very far into this book , primarily because I 've been burying myself in a bunch of books that are ( * gasp * ) not in this list .
That 's what I get for counting on my fingers , and limiting my blog list to 10 books .
Here 's the deal : for this one book , rather than talk about it , I 'll talk about why it 's in my to - read list .
JG and I have both , for the past year or so , been on an escalating and increasingly desperate search to find a ( much ) cleaner solution to our distributed computing challenges at Amazon .
We meet and talk about it at least once a week , where we compare notes on our research .
So far , the research indicates that all people who like J2EE should be strapped to a rocketship and blasted out into space .
But it 's just our preliminary findings , and we 're not quite ready to publish yet .
JG and I believe that there 's a solution to the problem out there , buried somewhere in the mass of literature about programming languages , operations research , distributed systems , and other disciplines .
Unfortunately , few of the researchers have access to systems as gigantic as ours , so they publish theoretical results that need to be sifted and understood before we can apply them to our problem domain .
That 's our labor .
For one thing , it 's abundantly clear that it 's time for us to move up to a higher level of abstraction .
The company can't deal effectively with our hundred million lines of code , a number that only increases as we pile on more OOP and Design Patterns crap auto - generated by IDEs .
I swear these Eclipse people can't see the trees for the forest ; everyone wants to be an architect , which they seem to feel is synonymous with blasting out hundreds of files for every individual computation that needs to occur .
I will blog about this at some point , but I can't let myself get sidetracked today .
This essay has been sitting unfinished for months , and I want to get it published .
The level of abstraction we need will be a language abstraction .
I do n't know if it 's going to be the addition of some Amazon - specific minilanguages that handle pattern - matching on clusters and networks of server nodes , or if it 's going to be a full - fledged networking language along the lines of Erlang or Gambit Scheme .
But Object - Oriented interfaces are failing us , and we need to turn today 's network into a computer that we can start programming directly , as if it 's a single machine .
Language abstraction , backed by solid mathematical and theoretical principles , is the only thing that can stop the madness of our code growth .
Lest this sound like insane ranting , I should point out that JG and I , along with maybe 18 other Amazonians , all nearing the six - year mark here , started out at a company called Geoworks , where we all spent 5 to 10 years writing an entire operating system and applications suite in 80x86 assembly language .
Everyone thought this was a great idea until we went out of business .
Programmers have a lemming - like attachment to the systems and processes they 're currently invested in .
It 's fairly easy to see the situation playing out again , this time at a higher level of abstraction : the EJB and C++ folks think that with their fancy OO interfaces , they 're working in the very aether of pure thought , when in fact what they 're doing is much more akin to assembly language .
You could argue with me , but you 'd have to explain the constant problems with our systems availability .
I encourage you to go do an impromptu survey : ask a bunch of directors and senior engineers why our systems availability has gotten so bad .
I did this over a year ago , surveying about 30 top people , and the answer I got back was always the same : complexity .
Our systems have become intractably complex .
The whole point of my writing that blog about John von Neumann was that he was the kind of person who would see intractable complexity coming , and find entirely new theoretical models that would make it tractable .
In fact , as George Dyson pointed out in his recent talk , von Neumann actually published a preliminary theory on creating reliable systems from unreliable components .
Then he began his work on cellular automata and other types of parallel systems , because he knew they were going to be the only way to do truly large - scale computing .
Here we are , stuck on poorly - understood networks of serial computers , trying desperately to pile on more code in the hopes that it 'll somehow fix things .
JG and I believe there is a way out for us .
It 's somewhere in the domain of parallel computing — the servers are parallel nodes , so this is n't exactly a huge intellectual leap .
We 've been studying the available research , and all roads lead to the same set of conclusions , one of which is that Functional Programming is going to be a necessity in this new world .
It 's a foregone conclusion .
And that , in a roundabout way , brings me to this book by Chris Okasaki .
It is absolutely unique .
It 's the world 's first textbook on purely functional data structures — i.e. , data structures with no side - effects .
I 'm not going to explain in this blog why this is such an important topic for Amazon and distributed computing in general , but I will point you to the book in the hopes that you are also interested in finding a solution .
Epilogue
These books might seem hard , but this whole effort is actually about making things easier for programmers .
J2EE might seem easy ; C++ might seem , well , ah , er , tractable , anyway .
Programming might seem fun right now , and the woes of our systems might seem to be a force of nature that one merely lives with — irascible pagan gods controlling our systems , and all we can do is offer up more code in hopeful sacrifices .
But it 's not the way things have to be , and languages 20 years from now will be so dramatically different ( and more powerful ) than the cruft you 're using today , it 'll seem as if you really were programming in assembly .
Or worse .
But the answer is out there , and we want to find it , or at least notice when someone else finds it , so we can start applying it here .

I bought and read GEB when I first moved up here and started at Amazon .
I read it all the way through , too .
That 's what being in an apartment by yourself , with no TV or Internet access will do to you ...

I also read GEB all the way through , back in my undergraduate days .
I have it on my shelf to reread , but it joins a stack of other books , so it will probably be some little while yet before I get around to rereading it .

Under pressure from federal judges , inmate advocacy groups and civil rights organizations , federal authorities are considering a sweeping cut in prison sentences that could bring early release for thousands of federal inmates .
The proposal being weighed by the U.S. Sentencing Commission would shave an average of at least two years off the sentences of 19,500 federal prisoners , about 1 in 10 in the 200,000 - inmate system .
More than 2,500 of them , mainly those who have already served lengthy sentences , would be eligible for release within a year if the rule is adopted .
Such a mass commutation would be unprecedented :
No other single rule in the two - decade history of the Sentencing Commission has affected nearly as many inmates .
And no single law or act of presidential clemency , such as grants of amnesty to draft resisters and conscientious objectors after World War II and the Vietnam War , has affected so many people at one time .
The far - reaching move is aimed at addressing what is seen as an unfair disparity in federal cocaine laws dating to the mid-1980s that have imposed much harsher punishment on crack cocaine users and dealers than in powder cocaine cases .
About 80 % of those sentenced on federal crack charges every year are African American .

The Justice Department is warning of dire consequences if the proposal goes through , including the possibility that returning thousands of serious drug offenders to the streets would compound a recent increase in violent crime across the country .
“ The unexpected release of 20,000 prisoners . . . would jeopardize community safety and threaten to unravel the success we have achieved in removing violent crack offenders from high - crime neighborhoods , ” the department said in a letter to the commission this month .
The congressionally chartered commission , which sets sentencing guidelines for federal judges , has already adopted reduced penalties for new crack cases hitting the courts effective Nov. 1 .
That decision will affect about 4,000 a cases a year .
The debate now is about its plans to make those changes retroactive to inmates .
The seven - member commission is considering the proposal at a hearing Tuesday ; a vote is expected next year .
Congress started enacting tougher penalties for crack offenders in the 1980s , at the height of public fears about spreading street violence associated with the drug , and amid concern that crack was more dangerous and addictive than powder cocaine .

The distinction became embedded in federal law and shaped the guidelines that the Sentencing Commission promulgated for two decades .
For example , it takes 100 times as much powder cocaine as crack to trigger mandatory five - and 10 - year prison terms under federal law .
Most experts now believe that the penalties exaggerate the relative harmfulness of crack compared with powder cocaine .
Another concern is that setting such relatively low thresholds for punishing crack offenders has led to the lengthy imprisonment not of major drug traffickers but of low - level street dealers , couriers and lookouts .
The disparity is under siege on several fronts .
There is bipartisan legislation in Congress that would narrow the penalties for crack compared with those for powder cocaine .
The Supreme Court is considering a case this term that would give judges even more discretion to reduce sentences in crack cases .

The widely differing treatment of crack offenders is “ fundamentally unjust , ” said Reggie B. Walton , a federal judge in Washington .
As a top White House drug- control official in the 1980s , Walton advocated tougher sentences in crack cases .
But the penalties have become too severe , he says .
Walton is testifying at the hearing Tuesday on behalf of the policymaking arm of the federal courts , which supports the sentencing proposal .
Walton is greatly concerned that the distinction has eroded confidence in the courts , he says .
In Washington , potential jurors often refuse to serve in crack cases , knowing that the penalties hurt African Americans more , he said .
He noted that a few years ago the commission made retroactive reductions in sentences for LSD offenders , who were mainly white .
If it does not do the same for defendants in crack cases , he said , it could be accused of a double standard .

“ If you are trying to send the message to the greater society that our process is a fair and just process , it becomes very difficult to say , Well , we lower the sentences retroactively for other types of drugs , but in reference to crack cocaine , which we know has had a significantly greater adverse impact on people of color , we are not going to do it , ” Walton said .
Advocacy groups for inmates , such as Families Against Mandatory Minimums , are being flooded with calls about the Sentencing Commission proposal .
Mary Price , the general counsel of the Washington - based group , says a co-worker has two sons in prison who would benefit from the sentencing change .
“ It is one of the very important civil rights issues of our day , ” said Hilary O. Shelton , director of the Washington office for the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People , which has long pushed for changing cocaine laws .
Potential beneficiaries of the proposal include Willie Mays Aikens , a former Major League Baseball star with the Kansas City Royals , who was sentenced to 20 years in federal prison in 1994 for selling 63 grams of crack to an undercover cop .

Aikens ’ case illustrates the effect of the crack / powder divide :
If the charges against him involved a similar amount of powder cocaine , he would have received a sentence of no more than 27 months .
Now , if the proposal passes , he will be eligible for release in 2009 , about three years earlier than his current release date , said his attorney , Margaret Love .
Justice Department officials question the wisdom of releasing drug dealers earlier than planned without sufficient time to train them to assimilate back into their communities .
The department estimates that about a third of those who could be released were convicted on related weapons charges and would pose a worrisome threat .
The department also said it was concerned about the courts being swamped with applications for reduced sentences .

“ This surge of litigation , much of which may be frivolous , would detract from our ability to investigate and prosecute current crime and will impede the courts ’ ability to deal with pending cases , both criminal and civil , ” Assistant Atty .
Gen. Alice Fisher said in a letter to the commission this month .
But federal judges said they would be willing to shoulder the load .
While acknowledging the possible risk to public safety , they also note that judges have discretion under the proposal to decline to reduce the sentence of a defendant who is considered a threat based on criminal history and other factors .
Some experts believe the quandary is the price for a tough - on - crime mentality that at the federal level has included longer sentences , the abolition of parole , and under the Bush administration , the virtual elimination of executive clemency .

They said that in the war on drugs over the last two decades , these measures had not necessarily worked out as expected : Despite prisons crowded with inmates , massive amounts of illegal drugs continue to flow into the country .
“ We are struggling to find ways to introduce some flexibility into this very rigid system , ” said Love , the Justice Department pardon attorney in the 1990s .
“ The only question is whether we are willing to give people currently doing hard time the benefit of this change of heart . ”

Japan 's justice minister named those executed for the first time
Seiha Fujima , convicted of killing five people while in his early 20s , will also not have known he was about to be taken to the gallows .
Nor would Hiroki Fukawa , a convicted double killer .
Japan does not tell death row prisoners that they are to be hanged until the last possible minute .
This has been condemned by the international community .
The failure to give advanced notice of executions is incompatible with articles 2 , 7 and 10 of the International Covenant on Civil and Human Rights , according to the United Nations Human Rights Committee .
But it is arguably no more cruel than the conditions in which death row inmates are kept while awaiting their fate .
Some reports put the average amount of time a prisoner given the death penalty waits for the sentence to be carried out at seven years and 11 months .
It is hard to get an accurate figure .
' Harsh regime '
Amnesty International says the inmates live under " a harsh regime and in solitary confinement with the ever - present fear of execution .
They never know if each day will be their last . "
Reports in the Japanese media describe how the men are kept in " toilet - sized cells " .
Because they are awaiting execution , they are held mostly in detention centres , not prisons .
They have fewer rights than other prisoners .
Cult leader Shoko Asahara is on Japan 's death row
Again it is hard to confirm what the conditions are actually like for each inmate - the nature of the regime is up to the director of each detention centre .
But many of those kept locked up alone for years are now getting older .
The oldest is said to be Tomizo Ishida , who is 86 .
He was convicted for rape and double murder in the early 1970s .
Some die before the sentence can be carried out .
In total there are 104 people on death row in Japan .
So far this year nine have been executed .
Before 1998 the Ministry of Justice would not even confirm that executions had been carried out .
There was simply an annual total released .
Only in the last 10 years has it released details of how many inmates were executed on a particular day .
Small step forward
Friday 's executions were the first time it has announced the inmates ' names .
Japan 's Justice Minister Kunio Hatoyama says this was done " to gain the understanding of the bereaved families of the victims and the public over the appropriateness of executions " .
Amnesty International , while " strongly protesting " the decision to execute the three convicted murderers , acknowledges that the change in policy over the naming of those executed represents a shift towards more openness - but it adds that there is a long way to go .
There were no candlelit vigils outside the detention centres where the men were hanged - though this is not surprising since no one , not even their families , was told they were to die on Friday morning .
Critics of the process say that the still quite considerable secrecy surrounding the executions is not only cruel , it is stifling debate about the issue .
Lawmakers rarely raise the question of the death penalty in parliament .
Opinion polls suggest only 6 % of Japanese people oppose the practice , though campaigners say this is because few people know much about the conditions in which the death row inmates are kept .
Friday 's executions were not headline news here .
In other countries , opposition to the death penalty is often mobilised by Christian churches .
But religious groups in Japan have chosen not to campaign on the issue .
Japan 's foreign ministry was reluctant to discuss the circumstances surrounding the latest executions with the BBC .
It should be pointed out that Japan incarcerates a far smaller proportion of its citizens than Britain or the United States .
But critics of the justice system are concerned about its reliance on confessions .
There are allegations that in some cases these are forced from suspects by police and prosecutors .
Those who oppose the death penalty here say there are not enough safeguards to prevent innocent people being put to death .
.- Peter Phillips , the Queen of Great Britain ’s eldest grandson , may have to give up his place in the line of succession for the throne because his fiancée is Roman Catholic .
This past week Buckingham Palace announced the engagement between Peter Phillips and Autumn Kelly , a Canadian management consultant , but no mention of a date for their marriage was made .
Even more interesting , is the fact that Autumn Kelly is Catholic .
Ms. Kelly ’s Catholicism brings to the light of day the 1701 Act of Settlement which bars any member of the Royal family from becoming or marrying Catholics .
If Mr. Phillips has to renounce his rights to inherit the throne , it would be an embarrassment to the royal family and to the government .
Catholics have repeatedly called for a repeal of the act but thus far attempts to change the law have failed .
Under the act , Mr. Phillips will be required to renounce his right to the throne -- he is 10th in line at present -- or Ms. Kelly will have to formally renounce her Catholic faith .
Buckingham Palace said yesterday that a wedding date had not been set and " if a decision has to be made , it will be made at the time of the marriage . "
Little is known about Ms. Kelly , who moved to Britain shortly after meeting Mr. Phillips at the Canadian Grand Prix in Montreal in 2003 .
The Tablet , the Catholic weekly , has now established that she was baptized on June 18 , 1978 , at St. John Fisher parish church in Point - Claire , a suburb of Montreal .
A spokesman for the church told the Daily Telegraph that Ms. Kelly 's mother , Kitty , had authorized the information to be disclosed , saying that her daughter was proud of her religion .
Attempts to revoke the law have been made .
John Gummer , a member of the Parliament who converted to Catholicism , tabled a Ten Minute Rule Bill in Parliament earlier this year in a bid to overturn the remaining anti-Catholic legislation .
Mr. Gummer said : " It is unacceptable that the part of the Christian church that has more active adherents than any other should be discriminated against in this way . "
In other comments , he slammed the law saying , " It is inhuman in the 21st century for anyone to demand this . "
According to the Act , which discriminates uniquely against Catholics , there is nothing barring a monarch from marrying a Hindu , Muslim or someone from any other faith .

Quagmire
An art project where drawings draw themselves .
Quagmire is an emulation of an impossible 8 bit processor , where all memory is addressed in 2 dimensions , and is represented by pixel value .
Program execution threads can run up , down , left or right .
Sections of code are visible in memory , as are the processes as they run .
Unlike a normal computer the internal process of the machine is visible .
Programs are drawings .
In this system , crashes can be viewed as they occur , processes can write all over each other , or themselves .
Lost threads of execution wander through memory , running any data they meander over .
Drawings
Fork Exec Exit
This is a series of artworks documenting some of the experimental drawings / programs I have tried with quagmire .
In these pictures , the memory contents is shown , with the program threads overlayed as white pixels .
Memory is cleared to white ( value 255 ) to make things easier to see , as most instructions are nearly black .
The first thread always starts at the bottom left corner heading from left to right .
A test program to broadly emulate the actions of the commands fork , exec and exit in a unix system - ie copy the code to another location , spawn a new process and exit the parent process .
As the new thread is spawned at 90 degrees counter clockwise to the parent , after the 3rd copy , a new process is written in exactly the same position as the original and the drawing is infinitely repeated .
Broken fork bomb
A fork bomb is similar to the program above , except it forks multiple copies of itself , which means memory will fill up and the machine will become inundated with processes .
Unfortunately there is a bug in the program , causing the copied processes to overwrite each other causing a crash .
Meandering through memory , a process thread manages to rerun the first program , but in reverse , writing to two memory positions in the centre of memory .
Self destruction
I thought of another , simpler method of causing mayhem .
This program fills memory with a drawing ( the x and y coordinates xor 'ed , then and 'ed ) that eventually overflows and overwrites itself , after that I had no idea what would happen to the program thread .
It skips into it 's drawing in image 5 , and then some localised order follows , lots of threads are spawned and then increasing chaos , as threads fall over each other , writing and executing .
At this point I am not sure where the chaos comes from , there is no randomness in the system and it 's entirely deterministic .
Perhaps it 's a pattern which is too hard for me to follow ?
Fork bomb
Finally the fork bomb works !
I 've increased the memory so the drawings are bigger .
Each process spawns two copies of itself , and the processes loop back over one another in a similar way to the first drawing .
Eventually the copies begin interfering with one another , resulting in one or two lost threads .
Interestingly , as the code is copying itself , errors are duplicated in the child threads .
Eventually something goes very wrong , and a strange program is created which spawns hundreds of threads , which then go on to make some interesting marks , but eventually settle into a repeating pattern of behaviour .

HAVANA ( Reuters ) - Cuba on Wednesday accused U.S. President George W. Bush of encouraging violent uprising against its communist government with a speech in which Bush urged Cubans to push for democratic change .
“ You will never force us to our knees , ” Cuban Foreign Minister Felipe Perez Roque said in response to Bush ’s speech , which came 15 months after ailing leader Fidel Castro handed over power to his brother .
Bush said he would maintain sanctions against Cuba and called on Cuban military and police officers to join efforts to open Cuba to multi-party democracy , saying liberty was more important that stability .
Perez said that was an “ invitation to violence ” by Bush .
“ Cuba categorically rejects the stimulation of violence and the invocation of the use of force , ” he said at a news conference .
Bush ’s speech reflected frustration with his plan for “ regime change ” in Cuba as his presidential term nears its end , the minister said .
Perez called on the United States to stop interfering in Cuba ’s internal affairs and lift the U.S. trade embargo and travel restrictions , which date from the early 1960s .
He said Bush had no moral authority to demand changes in Cuba after bloodshed in Iraq .
“ You are not a liberator , Mr. Bush .
You are a brutal repressor .
Your government has invaded , massacred and tortured in the name of liberty , ” Perez said .
He blamed “ Bush tyranny ” and not the American people for the U.S. government ’s hostility toward Cuba .
“ The day is coming when they will be free of him , ” he said .
US spy satellites to be used on Americans Nick Juliano
Published : Wednesday August 15 , 2007
Print This Email This Local and federal agencies are to have vastly expanded access to information gathered from spy satellites in the U.S. , the Wall Street Journal reports .
Information from " some of the U.S. 's most powerful intelligence - gathering tools " will soon be at the disposal of a wide array of law enforcement agencies at all levels of government , reports Robert Block in the Journal Wednesday .
Director of National Intelligence Michael McConnell decided to increase access to the spy data earlier this year and asked Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff to facilitate access to the spy data by civilian agencies and law enforcement .
Previously , access to only the most basic spy - sattelite data was limited to a handful of federal civilian agencies , such as NASA and the US Geological Survey , which used the images for scientific and environmental study .
The move to turn spy satellites on American citizens raises legal questions because the use of such data for law enforcement is " largely uncharted territory . "
Even the officials behind the move were unsure of its legal implications , the Journal reports .
" There is little if any policy , guidance or procedures regarding the collection , exploitation and dissemination of domestic MASINT , " noted a 2005 study from the US intelligence community , which recommended access to spy satellites .
MASINT , or Measurement and Signatures Intelligence , is a particular kind of spy - satellite data that would become available to law enforcement for the first time .
According to defense experts , the Journal reports , MASINT uses radar , lasers , infrared , electromagnetic data and other technologies to see through cloud cover , forest canopies and even concrete to create images or gather data .
" The full capabilities of these systems are unknown outside the intelligence community , because they are among the most closely held secrets in government , " Block writes .
" Some civil - liberties activists worry that without proper oversight , only those inside the National Application Office will know what is being monitored from space .
" You are talking about enormous power , " Gregory Nojeim , senior counsel and director of the Project on Freedom , Security and Technology for the Center for Democracy and Technology told the paper .
" Not only is the surveillance they are contemplating intrusive and omnipresent , it 's also invisible .
And that 's what makes this so dangerous . "
DHS intelligence chief Charles Allen " says the department is cognizant of the civil - rights and privacy concerns , which is why he plans to take time before providing law - enforcement agencies with access to the data .
He says DHS will have a team of lawyers to review requests for access or use of the systems . "

A Computer Associates security researcher is sounding the alarm that Facebook 's controversial Beacon online ad system goes much further than anyone has imagined in tracking people 's Web activities outside the popular social networking site .
Beacon will report back to Facebook on members ' activities on third - party sites that participate in Beacon even if the users are logged off from Facebook and have declined having their activities broadcast to their Facebook friends .
That 's the finding published on Friday by Stefan Berteau , senior research engineer at CA 's Threat Research Group in a note summarizing tests he conducted .
Of particular concern is that users are n't informed that data on their activities at these sites is flowing back to Facebook , nor given the option to block that information from being transmitted , Berteau said in an interview .
" It can happen completely without their knowledge , unless they are examining their network traffic at a very low level , " Berteau said .
The CA news comes after Facebook scrambled on Thursday night to tweak Beacon in order to calm complaints from privacy groups and Facebook users that the ad system is too intrusive and too confusing to opt out of .
Beacon is a major part of the Facebook Ads platform that Facebook introduced with much fanfare several weeks ago .
Beacon tracks certain activities of Facebook users on more than 40 participating Web sites , including those of Blockbuster and Fandango , and reports those activities to the users ' set of Facebook friends , unless told not to do so .
Off - Facebook activities that can be broadcast to one 's Facebook friends include purchasing a product , signing up for a service and including an item on a wish list .
The program has been blasted by groups such as MoveOn.org and by individual users who have unwittingly broadcast information about recent purchases and other Web activities to their Facebook friends .
This has led to some embarrassing situations , such as blowing the surprise of holiday presents .
On Thursday night , Facebook tweaked Beacon to make its workings more explicit to Facebook users and to make it easier to nix a broadcast message and opt out of having activities tracked on specific Web sites .
Facebook did n't go all the way to providing a general opt - out option for the entire Beacon program , as some had hoped .
But Berteau 's investigation reveals that Beacon is more intrusive and stealthy than anyone had imagined .
In his note , titled " Facebook 's Misrepresentation of Beacon 's Threat to Privacy : Tracking users who opt out or are not logged in , " he explains that he created an account on Conde Nast 's food site Epicurious.com , a site participating in Beacon , and saved three recipes as favorites .
He saved the first recipe while logged in to Facebook , and he opted out of having it broadcast to his friends on Facebook .
He saved the second recipe after closing the Facebook window , but without logging off from Epicurious or ending the browser session , and again declined broadcasting it to his friends .
Then he logged out of Facebook and saved the third recipe .
This time , no Facebook alert appeared asking if he wanted the information displayed to his friends .
After checking his network traffic logs , Berteau saw that in all three cases , information about his activities was reported back to Facebook , although not to his friends .
That information included where he was on Epicurious , the action he had just taken and his Facebook account name .
" The first two cases involve the transmission of user data despite ' No thanks ' having been selected on the opt - out dialog , and are causes for deep concern .
They pale , however , in comparison to the third case , where Facebook was receiving data about my online habits while I was not logged in , and was doing so silently , without even alerting me to the cross - site communication , " he wrote in the research note .
If a user has ever checked the option for Facebook to " remember me " -- which saves the user from having to log on to the site upon every return to it -- Facebook can tie his activities on third - party Beacon sites directly to him , even if he 's logged off and has opted out of the broadcast .
If he has never chosen this option , the information still flows back to Facebook , although without it being tied to his Facebook ID , according to Berteau .
Berteau was n't able to determine where this data flows to in Facebook .
" That 's part of the concern here , " he said in the interview .
He repeated the Epicurious experiment with Kongregate.com , another Beacon - affiliated site , and got similar results .
In e-mail correspondence with Facebook 's privacy department , Berteau was told , among other things , that " as long as you are logged out of Facebook , no actions you have taken on other websites can be sent to Facebook . "
A similar statement was made by a high - ranking Facebook official on Thursday .
In an interview with The New York Times , Chamath Palihapitiya , vice president of product marketing and operations at Facebook , was asked whether Facebook would receive information about a user 's purchase if the user declined to broadcast the purchase to his Facebook friends .
His answer : " Absolutely not .
One of the things we are still trying to do is dispel a lot of misinformation that is being propagated unnecessarily . "
Facebook did n't immediately reply to requests for comment from IDG News Service .

People who are looking to ease depression may have a new treatment option -- marriage .
A recent study suggests that marriage provides a greater psychological boost to depressed people than to happy people , even if the marriage is so - so .
Previous studies have suggested that the psychological perks of marriage depend upon marriage quality - - a happy marriage gives rise to a happy couple , and vice versa .
Other studies have shown that depressed people , who tend to communicate poorly and require more caring and support than happy people , also end up in unhappier marriages .
So Adrianne Frech , a sociology graduate student at Ohio State University , and her colleague , Kristi Williams , speculated that happy people would garner more psychological perks from marriage than depressed people .
To test their theory , they looked at a sample of 3,066 men and women who had been interviewed and tested for depression once in either 1987 or 1988 and then again five years later .
In the interviews , they were asked about the quality of their marriage ( if they were married ) .
On average , controlling for differences in depression , subjects who had gotten married over the five - year span between the two interviews reported improved psychological well - being in the second interview -- scoring an average of 3.42 points lower on the 84 - point depression scale -- than their counterparts who did not marry .
When they teased apart how marriage affected those who had been depressed at the start of the study to those who had been happy , however , they came across something unexpected .
The depressed who married scored an average of 7.56 points lower on the depression scale than the depressed who did not marry , while those who were happy and got married scored only 1.87 points lower on the scale .
In other words , marriage provided a much bigger psychological boost to the depressed subjects than to the happy subjects .
“ We were surprised , ” Frech told LiveScience .
“ We expected the depressed to have worse marital quality and therefore benefit less from a transition into marriage . ”
The findings , to be published in the Journal of Health and Social Behavior , hold true even though depressed people do have unhappier marriages .
“ The depressed benefit more from a transition into marriage despite their having , on average , worse marital quality , ” Frech noted .
The big remaining question , she says , is why depressed people benefit more from marriage than happy people .
It could be that marriage provides the companionship and emotional support needed to help alleviate depression , she said .
MICHAEL MUKASEY has been confirmed as attorney general .
But the profound moral , legal and constitutional issues raised at his Senate Judiciary Committee hearings are unresolved .
Mr. Mukasey should open the door to their resolution by releasing the Justice Department ’s long - secret legal opinions that have warped our fight against terrorism .
When the Justice Department , usually acting through its Office of Legal Counsel , issues legal opinions binding on the executive branch , there is never justification for keeping them secret .
Opinions that narrowly define what constitutes torture ; or open the door to sending prisoners for questioning to Egypt and Syria , which regularly use torture ; or rule the president has some “ inherent power ” to ignore laws are all of concern to Congress and the public whether one agrees or disagrees with the legal analysis .
Yet all these opinions have been kept secret , along with many other , related post - 9/11 opinions that purport to decide what America ’s law is .
Image Credit ... Alex Nabaum
Secrecy always increases the risk of foolish mistakes .
If the withheld opinions are sound , why fear letting them see the light of day ?
Is there ever a justification in a government of law for keeping what one believes to be the law secret ?
For evidence that America ’s political system is a criminal conspiracy , open your mind to piles of new analyses that prove beyond doubt that the official 9/11 story is a lie .
Years of a bipartisan cover - up of 9/11 lies make it much more than one horrendous past event .
It endures in infamy as a symptom of a corrupt and dishonest government .
Every day we pay for what 9/11 and its cover - up have burdened us with , including the costly Iraq war and the erosion of the rule of law and constitutional rights .
Power elites have suppressed the truth because they fear what will happen when the public understands that 9/11 was not accomplished solely by foreign terrorists .
Technically sound analyses of what happened at the World Trade Center have unequivocally shown that the official 9/11 story is not credible ( www.ae911truth.org ) .
Truth seekers have met their burden of proof ; the government has not met theirs .
Simply put , controlled demolition brought down three buildings , not fires from the impact of planes on two of them .
Not only was the US government involved , it has also conspired to hide the truth from the public .
Why ?
Republican and Democratic politicians and power elites fear that 9/11 truth will remove what little public trust remains in government .
The truth will produce political instability , perhaps breaking the two - party stranglehold on our political system .
And it should .
And it must , if we are to finally obtain the deep political reforms our nation desperately needs .
The decline started before George W. Bush and his criminal co-conspirators accelerated it with their blatant disregard for the rule of law and our Constitution .
It will continue , even with a Democratic administration , unless we reform our political system .
We must remind Americans that our nation was born in an insurrectionist , populist rebellion against political tyranny – and that 9/11 teaches us that we need a Second American Revolution .
We must destroy the domestic Axis of Arrogance of our plutocracy more than fear a foreign Axis of Evil .
How ?
A vast nationwide grassroots 9/11 truth movement is ignored by the mainstream news media .
Its success will be the catalyst for renewing American democracy .
It will produce a shock wave that rattles the brains of all Americans : Shock therapy from a truth so powerful and unsettling that Americans finally see the decline of American democracy that allowed 9/11 and its cover -up .
Make no mistake , the 9/11 truth movement holds the future of the United States .
We are not subversive “ conspiracy theorists ” or enablers of foreign terrorism .
We are patriotic warriors working to nullify group delusion produced by government propaganda .
Dozens of books and websites reveal countless technical contradictions and inconsistencies with the official government 9/11 story and the laws of physics .
The weight of the evidence supports one painful verdict :
Our federal government played a role , probably through a large “ black op . ”
The “ why ” is obvious :
To justify an unjust war to serve corporate interests and greed .
Here is our opportunity :
To make 9/11 the tipping point for American democracy renewal .
Our enemies fear that if this movement succeeds , their plutocratic , elitist cabal – the Axis of Arrogance – run by the two - party duopoly will collapse .
Corruption keeps our political system stable – truth must clean it up .
Instability is the necessary price for restoring democracy .
A Paradigm Shift
9/11 lies have sustained the ruling terrorism - threat paradigm .
9/11 truth must energize a new political - reform paradigm .
Patriotism framed as defending the nation against terrorism must be replaced by patriotism focused on repairing American democracy .
Already , status quo protectionists lie about us to defeat our movement .
Things will get worse as our movement draws closer to bringing down the corrupt political system .
And we are getting closer .
Only 16 percent of Americans believe that members of the Bush administration are telling the truth about what they knew about terrorist attacks on the US prior to 9/11 , according to a New York Times / CBS News poll .
But what people say in polls is not the same as coming out publicly and vociferously for 9/11 truth , or seeing the roots of 9/11 in the decay of American democracy , not merely the actions of a few evil people .
The deceived public must be re-educated to see the arrogant power elites running our national plutocracy as worse than radical Islamic terrorists .
Paul Craig Roberts captured the essence of the problem : “ Americans think their danger is terrorists .
They do n't understand the terrorists cannot take away habeas corpus , the Bill of Rights , the Constitution .
...
The terrorists are not anything like the threat that we face to the Bill of Rights and the Constitution from our own government in the name of fighting terrorism .
Americans just are n't able to perceive that . ”
9/11 is a history lesson to inform the nation about democracy decline .
As John McMurtry asked , “ So which goes - the faith in America ’s greatness and goodness in the world , or the facts which disclose the opposite at the very top ? ”
We must always remember that Americans are better than their government .
They do not get the government they deserve .
They get the government that the rich and powerful impose .
That must end .
We confront more than power elites .
There is psychological resistance of millions of Americans to painful 9/11 truth – a shameful , “ unthinkable ” truth about their elected government .
Even if they have doubts about the official story , they instinctively recoil and erect mental barriers to block out the full truth .
They want to keep believing that they live in a great democracy .
They want to believe that when the Bush administration is replaced our democracy will be in good shape again .
Hard to accept that 9/11 truth could not have been suppressed this long without the tacit or explicit approval of Democratic politicians and power brokers .
It is as if we are telling children that their parents are mass murderers .
Distracted , time - poor , depressed , political disengaged , cynical and insecure Americans do not want to hear that their government had a hand in 9/11 .
That for years their two - party - controlled government has blatantly lied to them .
That thousands of good Americans have died and been terribly injured in a war propped up by the false - flag 9/11 fiction .
In sum , that despite elections a vast criminal conspiracy has been so successful for so long .
Such thoughts hurt .
Also , political instability is scary to ordinary Americans .
But stability based on corruption and lies is destructive .
Only when Americans see 9/11 as a political attack ( by Americans on Americans ) – not solely a terrorist attack ( by foreigners on Americans ) – will they understand that revealing 9/11 truth must lead to major political reforms .
Instability is the cost of democracy renewal .
Here are powerful messages :
The collapse of the rule of law is more important than the collapse of buildings .
Countless more have died because of 9/11 than on 9/11 .
The events of 9/11 ultimately are less important than the reasons for and consequences of 9/11 .

Many quantum mechanics — as some like to call themselves — agree .
“ D- Wave is misleading the public by calling their device ‘ a practical quantum computer , ’ ” said Umesh Vazirani , a computer science professor at the University of California , Berkeley .
“ The whole point of quantum computing is achieving a large speedup over classical computers , something that D - Wave has n’t accomplished . ”
Dr. Rose dismissed such criticism .
He characterized D - Wave ’s approach as bluntly commercial : he expects the marketplace to endorse Orion and does n’t care about evaluations in peer - reviewed journals .
“ Our approach is to have it start solving problems ; how fast it does that becomes the metric by which you ’re judged , ” he said .
“ Compared to the academic approaches , ours is quick and dirty , although I do n’t think it ’s any less careful . ”
The high emotions inspired by the D - Wave controversy derive , perhaps , from the almost metaphysical allure of the field , an allure that has existed since the physicists Paul Benioff and Richard P. Feynman proposed the idea of quantum computing in the early 1980s .
In theory , a quantum computer in less than a minute could solve problems that would take millennia for a classical computer to solve .
For instance , a practical quantum computer could easily factor large integers , allowing them to break most cryptographic systems .
A quantum computer could also simulate the behavior of nanosized structures like drug molecules ; such “ quantum simulations ” would mean that biotechnologists could model drugs outside of a laboratory , potentially helping them to develop new therapies .
Dr. Rose is not shy about making even grander assertions .
He said he believes that a bigger and better Orion computer could also speedily provide optimal solutions to difficult problems with many variables , potentially reshaping such diverse activities as investment , scheduling , logistics , and supply chain management .
( Most computer scientists are more cautious : they say the dramatic speedups that Dr. Rose dreams of may be impossible with any quantum computer with a design similar to the Orion . )
In a piece by Baylor University senior Justin Mueller , he argues that the school “ should be more friendly to groups of disbelief . ”
Within the Atheist and Agnostic Society on campus ( yes , there is one ) nearly every member has told his or her “ story ” of their rejection of religious ideas , and the oft - ensuing parental sobbing and family strife that unsurprisingly follows .
Some of these people have also been homosexuals , which can add another layer of duress with the conservative prejudices that can accompany religiosity .
He sheds the myths …
As far as I know , very few atheists eat unbaptized babies .
Nor do we have a higher propensity for kicking puppies , to my knowledge .
… and tells anecdotes of intolerance :
We have no crosses or official symbols , yet the display of a simple Darwin fish , or some other celebration of science and reason is far more likely to receive the smashing in of a windshield with a baseball bat , or a personally delivered death threat ( both of which I have had the pleasure of receiving during my tenure at this loving Christian community ) than any sort of openly positive response .
And he asks university leaders a great question :
Finally , and perhaps most futile , a query for Baylor ’s religious establishment :
Why are non-Christians not deserving of recognition and the right to organize on campus ?
Yes , we non-Christians are fully aware that this is a private religious university , and that you can do what you wish .
The question is whether you should .
It is hypocritical to portray Baylor as a university that respects diversity and seeks intellectual advancement while denying the aspirations for self - discovery and intelligent discussion that many students can only find in the sorts of groups and organizations that Baylor disallows .
Baylor will never achieve its long - term goals of academic maturity if it continues to ignore and treat non-Christian students as if they are undeserving of similar privileges .
Nicely said .
What exactly is he talking about , though ?
Is n’t his atheist group already on campus ?
Yes , but only unofficially .
Check out this article from just over a year ago :
In spring 2005 , Mueller approached Dr. Dub Oliver , vice president of student life , to begin the process of making the Atheists and Agnostics Society an official student organization on campus .
The request was denied because of Baylor ’s policy , Oliver said .
Baylor ’s Student Policies and Procedure states : “ The recognition of a student organization represents University endorsement and approval of the goals and purposes of that organization as being consistent with and in support of the goals and mission of Baylor University . ”
Oliver said he believes an atheist group would not be consistent with Baylor ’s goal .
The mission of Baylor apparently being to stifle any contrarian voice .
I went ( and will one day return ) to grad school at DePaul University just outside Chicago .
It ’s also a private religious institution .
I have n’t have time to start an atheist group in my brief time there so far , but I do n’t anticipate there would be much resistance .
The school has been pretty open to non-Catholic voices in my time there .
Justin has the right idea .
Keep raising the question .
Draw attention to it .
Even if the school keeps saying no , you succeed in making them look hypocritical and foolish .
All you ’re asking for is the opportunity to meet and converse .
It ’s not asking a lot .

The first hearing began on the case of contaminated blood that was used for treatment of haemophilia patients in Britain .
The program created by NHS , a well - known health services in Britain , was meant to supply haemophiliacs with new blood product but it turned out that blood was infected with HIV and Hepatitis C. More than 2,000 patients infected through contaminated blood died or are reported to be seriously ill .
Newsnight BBC programme disclosed the hidden facts of contaminated blood use .
It became known that doctors were using blood of the clotting agent Factor 8 and these supplies were taken from US prisoners .
Specialists testing new blood products were neglectful of the danger and used blood from the donors who were infected with dangerous viruses .
The official data to prove the terrible incident disappeared .
As the government officials said , documents were deleted or not exposed to the public due to its confidentiality .
From one of the letters it was revealed that warnings on the possible HIV risk from the blood were made by one of the public health surveillance center , but those facts were ignored by Britain 's Department of Health .
It was also claimed that haemophiliac patients did n't know about the testing and did n't give their approval to test the blood .
Some of them stayed unsuspicious of their HIV positive status for years .
The first hearing is going to take place at Westminster were families of the tragic incident can speak .

UPDATE II :
An hour into what was supposed to be a 15 minute vote and the motion to table has FAILED .
Hoyer is now moving for a vote to go to committee .
Now a 15 minute vote on whether to have a vote to send impeachment articles to committee .
Got that ?
UPDATE I : Steny Hoyer has asked to table the resolution .
Representatives are now voting on whether it will be tabled our not .
It appears that Republicans are voting not to table it so everybody can see how ridiculous this whole thing is .
Let 's hope it's not tabled and it backfires on them and our Democratic " leadership "
The full Articles of Impeachment can be read here
Article I
" Richard B Cheney is Guilty of an impeachable offense warranting his removal from office "
Congressman Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) announced today that he will be offering a privileged resolution on the House floor next week that will bring articles of impeachment against the Vice President , Richard B. Cheney .
" The momentum is building for impeachment , " Kucinich said .
" Millions of citizens across the nation are demanding Congress rein in the Vice President ’s abuse of power .
" Despite this groundswell of opposition to the unconstitutional conduct of office , Vice President Cheney continues to violate the U.S. Constitution by insisting the power of the executive branch is supreme .
" Congress must hold the Vice President accountable .
The American people need to let Members of Congress know how they feel about this .
The Vice President continues to use his office to advocate for a continued occupation of Iraq and prod our nation into a belligerent stance against Iran .
If the Vice President is successful , his actions will ensure decades of disastrous consequences . "
The privileged resolution has priority status for consideration on the House floor .
Once introduced , the resolution has to be brought to the floor within two legislative days , although the House could act on it immediately .
Kucinich is expected to bring it to the House floor on Tuesday , November 6 .
H. Res. 333 , Articles of Impeachment against the Vice President , has 21 cosponsors .
They are : Rep. Tammy Baldwin ( D - WI ) , Robert Brady ( D - PA ) , Yvette Clarke ( D - NY ) , Rep. William Lacy Clay ( D - MO ) , Rep. Steve Cohen ( D - TN ) , Rep. Keith Ellison ( D - MN ) , Rep.

I 'd like to share an image with you that has become an important icon in my life .
It 's shrouded in mystery , but I hope to unravel some of its secrets soon .
To really get to the heart of this , I think we need to start with the cakes .
I have come to treasure the birthday cakes my family has made for me over the years .
Can they be a little crudely decorated ?
Absolutely .
And that is exactly what makes them so unbelievably great .
Looking at this photo , you might be thinking to yourself .
" Aww , that 's sweet .
His kids decorated a cake . "
You 'd be half right .
It 's sweet , but it was decorated by my FATHER .
The awesome beauty of cakes decorated by my dad is that they inevitably contain drawings that are either incomprehensible or have NOTHING to do with my life .
He 's adorable .
They 're like random , edible cave paintings .
Let 's review the imagery on CAKE 1 .
A : Not sure .
My guess is a musical note , but I honestly can't rule out a turnip or a bear tooth complete with root .
B : A cherry ... a pumpkin ... a chubby sperm ... who knows ?
C : I 'm going to go with either a boat or a submarine with periscope up .
D : Definitely a house .
I do own a house -- it 's nice to see one on a cake .
E : This brings us to " The Face " .
And it 's the real reason why we 're here .
The Face has been making appearances on my birthday cakes and cards for as long as I can remember and it always looks like this .
Before we delve further into The Face , let 's quickly review CAKE 2 .
( Despite it reading " Happy Birth Day Dad , " I swear to you this is the handiwork of my father , not my kids .
I also swear it 's a face . )
A : Boat .
Never owned a boat .
Do n't like the beach .
So , a nautical theme does make sense .
Over the years there have also been several cats .
Again , never owned a cat .
Do n't like cats .
But cats on my cake .
CLASSIC .
B : Definitely an anchor .
C : Hmm . A bowling ball ?
A ghost ?
I do n't have a clue .
D & E : A rare double - shot of THE FACE .
Here 's another look at it :
US Constitution Article 3 Section 3 . Treason against the United States , shall consist only in levying War against them , or in adhering to their Enemies , giving them Aid and Comfort .
No Person shall be convicted of Treason unless on the Testimony of two Witnesses to the same overt Act , or on Confession in open Court .
On Sept 20th , 2001 , George W. Bush announced a " war on terror " .
" Our war on terror begins with al Qaeda , but it does not end there .
It will not end until every terrorist group of global reach has been found , stopped and defeated . "
http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2001/09/20010920-8.html
If we are engaged in a war on terrorist groups , then anyone who gives aid and comfort to terrorist groups is an enemy .
One major aim of terrorist groups is to get hold of weapons of mass destruction , in order to better terrorize a target population , such as the people of the US .
At the time Bush gave his speech , Valerie Plame was an undercover CIA agent , running an international ring of CIA assets , whose job was tracking WMD 's through world black markets and preventing them from falling into the hands of terrorists .
Two years later , her undercover identity was leaked to the press .
Her outing did serious and lasting damage .
You know that game in Brain Age where you get a quick look at a batch of numbers then have to tap them in numerical order after they 're hidden ?
In news that must please the good Dr. Kawashima to no end , scientists at Kyoto University have found that five - year - old chimps are able to perform a ( very ) similar feat much faster than a group of nine able - minded college students on a touchscreen test bed that resembles the best - selling DS game .
With a . 7 second look , both man and beast are on even ground , but with a 0.4 second or 0.2 second (!! ) peek , the college kids got owned , completing it 40 % of the time compared to the chimps ' 80 % .
One thing 's for sure — taking this test probably did n't help the college kids with their self esteem .
While not as funny as a chimp working a typewriter while smoking a cigarette , the video above of brave Ayumu doing his thing is pretty damn amazing .
Get that chimp a stylus !

And if you want to be impressed , see the next video , showing the chimps memorizing the digits after the mere peek .

Jimmy
Wales says students should be able to cite Wikipedia
Speaking at the Online Information conference at London 's Olympia , he played down the long - running controversy over the site 's authority .
He said young students should be able to reference the online encyclopaedia in their work .
Mr Wales said the site , which is edited by users , should be seen as a " stepping stone " to other sources .
As long as an article included accurate citations , he said he had " no problem " with it being used as a reference for younger students , although academics would " probably be better off doing their own research " .
" You can ban kids from listening to rock ' n ' roll music , but they 're going to anyway , " he added .
" It 's the same with information , and it's a bad educator that bans their students from reading Wikipedia . "
In 2005 , at the height of the controversy over the site 's accuracy , Mr Wales told the BBC that students who copied information from Wikipedia " deserved to get an F grade " .
Mr Wales said the website still lacked the authority to be used as a citeable source for college - aged and university students .
But he said new editing and checking procedures had made Wikipedia more trustworthy .
Changing procedures
Since the controversy , in which it emerged that the " free editing " policy had allowed articles containing inaccuracies and bias to appear , the site has introduced a system of real - time peer review , in which volunteers check new and updated articles for accuracy and impartiality .
Volunteers check Wikipedia entries for inaccuracies and bias
It is this perceived lack of authority that has drawn criticism from other information sources .
Ian Allgar of Encyclopaedia Britannica maintains that , with 239 years of history and rigorous fact - checking procedures , Britannica should remain a leader in authoritative , politically - neutral information .
Mr Allgar pointed out the trustworthy nature of paid - for , thoroughly - reviewed content , and noted that Wikipedia is still prone to vandalism .
But Britannica and Wikipedia should not be seen as direct competitors .
Wikipedia , he said , had made the use of encyclopaedias " trendy and popular " with young people , which could only benefit Britannica 's subscription - led service .
Content licensing
Jimmy Wales also said that the Free Software Foundation would be rolling out a new version of its free documentation licence , which Wikipedia may adopt .
We are the Red Cross for information .
We wo n't sell out to Google

Mr Wales reiterated his commitment to keeping the Wikimedia Foundation free of corporate sponsorship , and of major donors who might want control of online information .
" We are the Red Cross for information .
We wo n't sell out to Google , " he said .
The foundation is , however , expanding into the search function , with July 's announcement of the Wikia search facility which combines open - source searching and social networking .
" This is a political statement against proprietary - driven software tools , " Mr Wales said .
" Wiki wants to give people the maximum freedom to do good . "

ACLU ' shocked ' US defying UN torture committee 's recommendations Nick Juliano

This A civil liberties and human rights group says the US has failed to correct policies that violate international conventions on torture and cruel treatment , and it accuses the US of continuing to violate international treaties .
 With the debate over waterboarding front and center , it is shocking to see the U.S. government continue to defend its shameful record of sanctioning secret and indefinite detention and its lack of accountability for torture and abuse ,  said Jamil Dakwar , Advocacy Director of the ACLU Human Rights Program .
 The torture committee attempted to give the U.S. government a chance to correct its wrongs , but unfortunately the Bush administration responded with nothing more than empty gestures and hollow words .
Responding to concerns from the United Nations ' Committee Against Torture , the US government questioned the authority of the UN's Convention Against Torture and other Cruel , Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and its applicability against US forces operating during wartime .
The US resists attempts to document all of the prisoners in its custody , and flat - out refuses to shut down the controversial prison at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , or grant habeas corpus rights to its detainees .
The government 's defense insisted detainees get access to a " judicial process , " which reviews whether a detainee was properly classified as an enemy combatant but does not have to level specific charges to justify the detention .
The UN demanded an end to interrogation techniques including " sexual humiliation , ' waterboarding , ' ' short shackling ' and using dogs to induce fear . "
The US repeatedly insists that " torture " is a violation of US law , but it does not renounce the listed techniques .
News reports have indicated that US interrogators have engaged in those practices .
A copy of the 13 - page document can be downloaded here .
 The U.S. governments report demonstrates that its progress is woefully inadequate ,  said Elizabeth Alexander , Director of the ACLU National Prison Project .
 Nowhere did the government report any significant improvements in preventing the abusive conditions of confinement in this country , the problem of sexual assault in our prisons , or the use of restraint devices that have endangered many detainees and prisoners held domestically .
The ACLU pointed out several deficiencies in the Bush administration 's response to the UN : # According to the ACLU , todays response from the U.S. reveals that it has failed to respond to the torture committees directives from last year , including :  Ensuring that no one is detained in any secret detention facility ;  Prohibiting the transfer or the rendition of persons to countries where they could be at risk of being tortured and providing detailed records on all diplomatic guarantees assuring that a person will not be tortured if expelled , returned , transferred or extradited since 9/11 ;  Closing the detention facility at Guantánamo Bay , and either permitting access by the detainees to a fair judicial process or releasing them as soon as possible while ensuring that they are not returned to any state where they could face a real risk of being tortured ;  Ending gender - based humiliation and the mistreatment of women detainees , including the federal Bureau of Prisons  policy of shackling of women during childbirth in certain circumstances ;  Promptly , thoroughly and impartially investigating all allegations of acts of torture or cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment by law enforcement personnel and bringing perpetrators to justice ;  Addressing sentences of life imprisonment for children , which could constitute cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment ;  Ensuring that reports of brutality and ill - treatment of members of vulnerable groups by law enforcement personnel including those related to the aftermath of Hurricane Katrinaare independently , promptly and thoroughly investigated and that perpetrators are prosecuted and appropriately punished . #
It had to happen , but it took so long - indeed , too long , for a courageous filmmaker to rise up and put the abysmal U.S. healthcare system under a microscope in order to reveal how utterly pathological it has become .
On one level , Moore repeated a blatant flaw in his craft so obvious in “ Bowling For Columbine ” and “ Fahrenheit 911 ″ in that he almost always fails to fully connect the dots and take his work to the next level , and “ Sicko ” was no exception .
Nevertheless , the film left me laughing , cheering , and crying and particularly gleeful regarding memos sent by management throughout the Blue Cross system warning employees of the possible side - effects of “ Sicko ” on their company ’s image .
In the light of Moore ’s impressive research and documentation , after listening to the film ’s horror stories of patients raped by the “ disease - care ” system , after witnessing the confessions of former players in that system who have come clean and can only live with themselves by spilling their guts regarding the devious methods they used to keep the system intact and bloat its profits , after hearing the Oval Office conversation between Richard Nixon and John Ehrlichman in which the two salivated over the spoils guaranteed to the industry as a result of creating a sprawling network of HMO ’s , after the poignant scenes near the movie ’s end of real people - 9/11 rescue workers , actually getting extraordinarily humane and completely free healthcare in Cuba , there is little left to say about the American system because one can only hold one ’s nose and gasp for fresh air in face of the overpowering , nauseating stench of the most brutal medical industry on earth .
I do not hesitate to label it unequivocally , pure evil .
Not only is the American disease - care industry the biggest rip - off of any healthcare system on earth , but it is being used to prop up an expiring economy because it creates jobs , and without those jobs , the U.S. unemployment rate , already fudged with bogus statistics , would immediately spike .
Not only is U.S. healthcare devastating the lives of Americans who use it , but it is being manipulated to give the appearance of economic health in a code - blue economy now in collapse .
Moreover , unlike the healthcare systems of many developed countries , the American system gives much lip service to preventive medicine , but only about 1 % of the American healthcare dollar goes to prevention programs and for one simple reason : Sickness is profitable , and prevention is not .
But once again , Moore does not ask the deeper questions such as :
What is inherent in the American capitalist system that propagates and rewards such carnage ?
In fact , he fails to notice that profit over people is at the core of Western civilization and the culture of empire .
Ten thousand years of civilization which include the raping and overpopulating of the earth , the depletion of the planet ’s resources , the dizzying pace of global warming , and the extinction of hundreds of species per day , have brought us to exactly this point .
How could the inhabitants of the belly of the beast have access to anything better than a disease - purveying medical system that facilitates the elimination of the middle and working classes while guaranteeing that the ruling elite will wax healthier and more affluent ?
Fortunately , “ Sicko ” does not spend much time suggesting that somehow this system can be reformed , improved , or streamlined which would be the proverbial band - aid for cancer .
But neither has Moore yet diagnosed the malignancy at the core not only of the American healthcare system but of civilization itself .
To his credit , perhaps the most important line in “ Sicko ” was the pivotal question : “ What have we become that we have allowed this to happen ? ”
And so I sit with the first four words of that question - what have we become ?
Until this question is explored , Moore and all other well - intentioned progressives will miss the point .
Civilization is in an inexorable , cataclysmic downward spiral of collapse .
The American disease industry is only one of a plethora of institutions and systems in a process of abject crumbling - education , religion , economic systems , family , political systems , energy , transportation , infrastructure , food production - the list is virtually infinite .
The tragic footage of the Minneapolis bridge collapse , now burned by corporate news media into the American mind , is a ghastly metaphor for the failed fiasco of civilization , as well as a ghoulish consequence of a rotting infrastructure that the corporatocracy refuses to attend to in its frantic obsession with global resource wars .
U.S. healthcare is a nightmare with few options .
In order to receive efficient , free care , it is almost necessary to move to another country .
Unfortunately , “ Sicko ” implies that moving to Canada is a viable option , but in reality , emigrating to any country is not easy and usually requires a long , mind - numbing process of bureaucratic red tape - especially for Americans whose investments and government checks are welcome in foreign banks , but whose quest for jobs is not .
Furthermore , Canada will soon be inundated with immigrants as Americans move there in droves and as 4000 people per week leave the U.K. for destinations like Canada , South Africa , and Australia .
It behooves every American who takes collapse seriously and is consciously preparing for it , to learn healthcare skills .
An individual can enroll in or audit almost any basic emergency lifesaving or first aid course at local community colleges or hospitals around the country .
Health care professionals who are preparing for collapse can take their preparation to the next level by offering informal workshops on various aspects of healthcare for non-professionals .
Moreover , a basic knowledge of herbal remedies and a generous inventory of them is essential , not only as access to traditional healthcare diminishes but as herbal remedies themselves become more difficult to acquire in terms of prices and the likelihood of government control or elimination of them .
In addition , the Hesperian Foundation offers a treasure - trove of books and DVD ’s for non-professionals such as “ Where There Is No Doctor ” , “ Where There Is No Dentist ” , “ Where Women Have No Doctor ” , a “ Handbook For Midwives ” , “ Helping Health Workers Learn ” , and a variety of related topics .
People with access to medical supplies may want to consider amassing a cache of them for times when they may not have access to healthcare at all , even if they have health insurance .
Those who require specific medications for survival may want to work with their physician or experts in chemistry to stockpile medication or chemical ingredients necessary for the medicines they need .
A series of articles by Dan Bednarz such as Peak Oil and Healthcare posted at the Energy Bulletin , offers detailed explanations of the impact of Peak Oil and collapse on the American healthcare system which is so energy and technology - dependent .
As I have written innumerable times , federal , state , and local governments are not going to be able to provide basic services in the throes of collapse - even if they want to .
Katrina was nothing if not a glaring example of this reality .
I for one am not interested in making American systems better but instead , telling the truth about their irreversible demise .
If I ’m not honest about that , then I will do silly and meaningless things like vote in elections and believe that buying a Prius and converting to non-incandescent light bulbs or the development of magic - bullet technology will avert a catastrophic global energy crisis .
In fact , if I do n’t tell the truth about civilization ’s collapse I will become seduced into the lie that we can keep the entire house of cards intact and worse , that doing so is a really good idea .
I want not only Michael Moore but the entire progressive movement to tell us the truth about what comes after the death of the American healthcare system .
I want all of them to break the indelicate news that humanity is murdering the earth and all life forms on it - themselves and the rest of the planet .
I want them to stop tenaciously , naively , delusionally hanging on to “ hope ” and other soporifics of consumerism and the American way of life , or more truthfully , the American way of death .
I want them to stop calling me “ dismal ” because I say what is so and refuse to ignore the flatulent neon elephant in the very small room of planet earth which is growing smaller and more diseased by the moment .
I want the so - called physicians of socio / political / ecological / and cultural well being to stop telling us terminal patients that there are solutions , elixirs and potions of political choice , actions to take , movements to marshal , candidates who will save us .
I want them to tell the truth about their own and earth ’s prognosis and the sinking of the Titanic and focus instead on creating lifeboats and look at the really , really big picture beyond myopic , truly terminal optimism .
So thank you Michael Moore for your gutsy , funny , but very poignant expose of the U.S. disease - care empire .
Yet as much as I loved “ Sicko ” , I want a deeper diagnosis , one that will truly assess the vital signs of a crumbling culture and a civilization that the progressive community insists on keeping on life - support when the kindest and most scrupulous act any of us can perform is to simply , swiftly pull the plug and record time of death .

Minor corrections and adjustments July 20 , 2007 .
“ All that was needed was an unending series of victories over your own memory .
‘ Reality control , ’ they called it ; in Newspeak , ‘ doublethink . ’ ”
George Orwell , 1984 .
Blood Diamond is a Hollywood film depicting horrific bloodshed in West Africa , in 1999 , spawned by the lust for diamonds .
The film opens with the understatement that “ thousands have died and millions have become refugees . ”
But more than 70,000 people died in Sierra Leone ’s war .
The film immediately segues to a palatial boardroom in Antwerp , Belgium , to the G - 8 Conference on diamonds .
The all - white executives are ostensibly concerned , holding worried discussions about … the fate of people ?
Africa ’s people ?
“ According to a devastating report by Global Witness , ” says one of the G - 8 execs , “ these [ conflict ] stones are being used to purchase arms and finance civil war . ”
The inference is that world leaders were surprised by the revelations of Global Witness — a London - based watchdog organization that the film clearly advertised for exposing corporate malfeasance .
“ We must remember that these stones comprise only a small percentage of the legitimate diamond industry , ” says another G - 8 exec , “ whose trade is critical to the economies of many emerging nations . ”
Excuse me ?
Legitimate diamond industry ?
Emerging nations …?
The Africans in the film are remarkably well dressed and salubrious , and the African scenes are remarkably sunny , clean , or , well , sanitized : the effects of poverty and hunger are made invisible .
Indeed , the film plays and replays miscellaneous objectionable stereotypes and inaccuracies , but this is Hollywood , after all , part of the American media , where degrading racial themes are routinely peddled .
The film also has its share of embedded corporate branding —
Hustler ; Smirnoff , National Geographic ; Guinness ; BBC ; UNCHR , Mercedes , World Food Program …
At the end of the film a disclaimer tells us that in 2003 the international community — those G - 8 executives “ partnered ” with the diamond industry — established formal mechanisms to control the flow of conflict diamonds .
The film ’s disclaimer parrots the line of the World Diamond Council , an international organization created by the diamond industry .
Both assure consumers that more than 99 % of rough stones today come from conflict - free sources , thanks to the United Nations - mandated Kimberley Process — a voluntary self - regulation scheme where the industry crafts ‘ passport ’ documents certifying all stones as conflict free .
According to the people who profit from diamonds , the blood diamonds problem is passé .
“ It ’s not passé , ” says Father Rocco Puopolo of the Africa Faith and Justice Network .
A child soldier in Sierra Leone shot Puopolo in 1999 .
“ The diamond industry can claim what they want .
The film is a template for what I believe is going on in parts of Africa today . ”
Looking behind the scenes of the movie — and behind the sparkle of the World Diamond Council — we are reminded of George Orwell ’s novel 1984 , where the character Winston falsifies news to peddle the Party ’s propaganda .
Orwell ’s ‘ Ministry of Truth ’ turned all truth upside - down , and all deceptions downside - up .
Orwell gave us ‘ doublethink ’ and ‘ newspeak ’ and a fictionalized portrait of the future grounded in Orwell ’s experience of propaganda .
Is the diamond industry peddling Orwellian diamondthink ?
“ More than 99 % of diamonds are conflict free , ” the industry chorus tells us , “ thus all diamonds are conflict free . ”
Like the Blood Diamond disclaimer , the World Diamond Council ( WDC ) sweeps conflict diamonds into the mindshafts of history .
The “ Clean Diamond Act ” — passed by the U.S. Congress in 2003 — does the same .
All is well , they say , in Diamondville .
To be sure we understand that , the WDC in 2006 launched a blitzkreig advertising campaign — full - page ads in the New York Times , USA Today , Los Angeles Times , the International Herald Tribune — touting the self - policing successes of the Kimberley Process .
The campaign was presumably coordinated to counter the supposed “ negative publicity ” of the Blood Diamond film .
To shore up lover ’s hearts in the pre-Christmas ‘ 06 diamond rush , the New York Times echoed the WDC ’s statement , adding that diamond revenues today bring health care , education and development to African countries , those emerging nations .
“ This [ diamond ] is supposed to be a symbol of all things good , ” a pullout in the NYT article reads — page E - 10 — next to a seductive model with a glimmering smile and a glamorous gown .
The article points buyers to diamonds from Canada : no blood spilt in Canada , right ?
Same paper , same day , had a full - page Tiffany advert — page A - 10 — with soft aquamarine hues offsetting the sparkle of diamonds and the tender allure of text : “ My True Love Gave to Me . ”
Are blood diamonds merely polished by public relations ?
The Kimberly Process was launched under the narrow definition that “ conflict diamonds ” only originate from conflicts between ‘ rebels ’ and ‘ governments ’ : it refers to smuggling by militias antagonistic to ‘ legitimate ’ member governments .
But the examples of Angola and Zimbabwe illustrate how the new rules are used against immigrants , refugees and poor citizen miners .
This is the essence of diamondthink : truth and lie are inseparable , with deadly consequences .
MY TRUE LOVE TOOK FROM THEE
In Angola they are called artisanos or garimpeiros , and they are literally mining for their lives : garimpeiros in Angola are forced into ‘ illegal ’ mining because Angola ’s mining security companies push people off their own land .
While agriculture and commerce in the region require the direct authorization of the Provincial Governor , not one artisano has been granted a license for diamond exploration or subsistence agriculture .
The ‘ legitimate ’ government of Angola forces desperate people to resort to ‘ illegal ’ activities to survive .
Three private military companies — PMCs — have been targeting garimpeiros in Angola .
The mercenary firms Alfa - 5 , Teleservices , and K&P Mineira defend Angola ’s big name diamond firms like Sociedade de Desenvolvimento Mineiro ( Sodiam ) , Sociedade Mineira de Cuango , and Sociedade Mineira Luminas .
Human rights researcher Rafael Marques documented case after case of PMCs arresting , beating and torturing garimpeiros .
They stop garimpeiros from fishing in their rivers , growing their own food , or living traditional lives ; they have forced sexual relations on family members , including same - sex rape and sodomy .
The PMCs operate behind Angola ’s public diamond company , Endiama , and have exclusive rights to Angola ’s diamonds .
Endiama owns 99 % of shares in Sodiam , which has a joint venture with Lazare Kaplan International ( LKI ) of the Israeli - American Maurice Tempelsman family .
Sodiam works with the Russo - Israeli Lev Leviev Group .
Endiama owns part of Alfa - 5 , the PMC that exploits and tortures garimpeiros .
Alfa - 5 and K&P Mineira provide security for ASCORP — the Angola Selling Corporation — another Angolan monopoly .
In Marques ’ case reports , garimpeiros describe a mysterious white foreigner of British origin , an armed agent working in the field for Alfa - 5 , who beats and tortures people .
One of ASCORP ’s controlling investors , Lev Leviev , runs a global commercial empire that includes : Leviev Group of Companies ; Lev Leviev Diamonds ; Africa - Israel ( commercial real estate in Prague and London ) ; Gottex ( swimwear ) Company ; 1,700 Fina gas stations in the Southwest U.S. ; 173 7 - Elevens in New Mexico and Texas ; a 33 % stake in Cross Israel Highway ( Israel ’s first toll road ) ; and more .
Leviev partner Arcady Gaydamak , an arms dealer , also reportedly works with Danny Yatom , a former MOSSAD ( Israeli secret service ) chief and security advisor to former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak .
Leviev is connected to Russian President Vladimir Putin , and to Sandline International , a U.K. / South African mercenary firm .
Angola remains a war - torn country .
The União Nacional para a Independência Total de Angola ( UNITA ) rebels , backed by the CIA during the Cold War , and then targeted by the Clinton Administration , and then partnered with the “ rebels ” in Congo ’s wars , are known to sell $ 100 million worth of diamonds annually .
While participants in the Kimberley Process complained of UNITA ’s criminality , they gave the “ legitimate ” Dos Santos government a sparkling bill of health .
The Angola example shows how ‘ black markets ’ are created by predatory ‘ white ’ economies which perpetuate suffering and dispossession ; diamond companies do not ‘ ignore atrocities ’ as the New York Times wrote in their December whitewash , they create and perpetuate them .
BETRAYAL IS FOREVER
Zimbabwe is the epitome of diamondthink .
From December 2006 to January 2007 , Zimbabwe ’s police executed Operation Chikorokoza — “ end of illegal mining ” — against ‘ illegal ’ gold panners and diamond miners countrywide .
Police set up roadblocks and brutalized travelers .
They arrested and terrorized at least 24,890 people , and burned down the houses of artisanal miners and others displaced by the international destabilization of Zimbabwe .
Meanwhile , police confiscated some 3.5 kilograms of gold worth over $ 57.3 million ; 552,227 kilograms of gold ore ; 92 emeralds ; and 7,868 diamonds .
Robert Mugabe ’s cronies and their international benefactors have destabilized and depopulated DRC , looting copper , cobalt , timber , uranium and diamonds .
Mugabe ’s Zanu - PF party in recent years crashed the international media scene for evicting white farmers under ‘ land reform ’ , but untouched are the largest landholders : multinational corporations .
Mugabe seized power in 1981 on the empty promise of land reform .
In the 1980 ’s Mugabe and his “ liberation ” army terrorized the Ndebele people under the Gukurahundi — a bona fide genocide .
After arming Mugabe ’s gang , the international “ community ” closed its eyes to the slaughter ; attempts to break the story were squashed in Britain and the U.S. Equally invisible are Mugabe ’s ties to international arms dealer John Bredenkamp , one of the 50 richest Britons , worth $ 1 billion , tied to BAE Systems ( British Aerospace ) and the U.S. state department , and Billy Rautenbach , another Western mining cartel crony and white patron of Mugabe .
The World Diamond Council “ expressed concern ” about Zimbabwe ’s complicity in pillaging and smuggling rough diamonds from the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( DRC ) into neighboring South Africa for onward sale into the world market under fraudulent certificates of origin .
But the threat of sanctions against Zimbabwe is not about diamonds : while international capital is isolating and punishing Zimbabwe ’s intransigent President , Robert Mugabe , other criminal diamond networks and racketeering of equal scale and nature will be tolerated .
Angola and Zimbabwe exemplify the process whereby an international certification scheme enforced by the United Nations rubber stamps boxes of rough stones according to their ‘ country of origin . ’
Stamped ‘ Angola ’ or ‘ Zimbabwe ’ the public is assured that these diamonds are now ‘ conflict free , ’ because these nations are members of the Kimberley certification .
Coming from ‘ governments ’— and not ‘ rebels ’ or ‘ militias ’ — consumers can be at peace as they slip a diamond on their fiancé ’s finger .
WHAT CLINTON ( LOVERS ) WILL NEVER SEE
Botswana is a classic example of a “ peaceful ” country engaged in diamond exploration : if any diamond in Africa were conflict free , one would think Botswana would be the place to find it .
But the Botswana government has a long history of oppression against the San people — Bushmen of the Kalahari — and continues to force them off ancestral lands to make way for the world ’s premier diamond cartel , De Beers / Anglo - American Corp .
The diamondthink of De Beers knows no limits : they have claimed that protecting tribal homelands leads to apartheid .
Diamond finds in the Bushmen ’s ancestral lands inspired government evictions .
“ Money from diamonds has undoubtedly funded the evictions and the ‘ relocation camps ’ which the Bushmen call ‘ places of death , ’ ” wrote Survival International .
“ De Beers ’ Managing Director in Botswana backed the removals .
De Beers falsely claims there were no Bushmen originally in its concession .
It has also stated that laws to protect tribal peoples should not be applied in Africa , as they ‘ lead to apartheid . ’ ”
Botswana and Namibia have been fighting over water , and the flows of refugees and dissidents brought Botswana into the cross hairs of the Pentagon in the late 1990’s .
A U.S. military build - up ensued : electronic intelligence listening posts , an expansive air base built in the Bushman ’s desert , weapons and training programs .
Construction began in 1994 , and the U.S. “ turned the base into a staging area for [ special operations ] forces involved in quelling civil wars and secessionist movements in Africa . ”
Botswana ’s opposition complained : “ Why should we put up such a sophisticated and costly facility when people are starving ? ”
After President Clinton ’s glowing speech in Botswana in 1998 , Professor Larry Swatuk at the University of Botswana complained : “ The San people of the Central Kalahari have been relocated from within the Central Kalahari Game Reserve to make way for new tourism ventures and mineral prospecting by multinational corporations , including De Beers .
About 3,000
San were moved to a bleak settlement called New Xade some 45 km beyond the reserve 's western border ...
Unemployment , jobless economic growth , political in - fighting , conflicts over natural resources within and between states , and increasing militarization in a region too familiar with the human and material costs of war : these are some of the realities that Bill Clinton should have seen . ”
By 2003 Australian BHP - Billiton was prospecting with leases over 78,000 sq. kms of Botswana , some 27,000 sq. kms in the Kalahari Reserve .
In a “ landmark ” court case decided in December 2006 , the San won the “ rights ” to re-enter their ancestral lands in the Central Kalahari Game Reserve , but the government stipulated that they cannot erect permanent structures , they cannot hunt , or drill boreholes , and to expect no services from government .
Rapaport News called the court case , “ the longest and most expensive in Botswana 's history . ”
Diamonds are a $ 2 billion industry in Botswana , and the government is a 15 % shareholder in De Beers .
The Bushmen say : “ We as First People of the Kalahari believe that conflict diamonds are whenever diamonds cause pain and suffering .
That is why we call Botswana diamonds conflict diamonds . ”
WHERE DO HILLARY ’S DIAMONDS COME FROM ?
Belgian - born Maurice Tempelsman has a long and bloody history in Africa .
When Congo ’s first Premier , Patrice Lumumba , pledged to return diamond wealth back to the newly independent Congo in the early 60’s , Tempelsman , who began with De Beers in the 1950 ’s , helped engineer the coup d’etat that consolidated the dictatorship of 29 year - old Colonel Mobutu , and the coup against Ghana ’s Kwame Nkrumah ; diamonds were at stake in each .
“ I believe this was the beginning of what we now know of as conflict diamonds in the Congo , ” says blood diamond expert Janine Roberts .
“ From then on diamonds would be extensively used to discreetly fund wars , coups , repression and dictatorships , in Africa . ”
“ Tempelsman ’s role in the confluence of public policy and private profit as a middleman for the De Beers diamond cartel may have shaped every major U.S. covert action in Africa since the early 1950s .
Declassified memos and cables between former U.S. presidents and State Department officials over the last four decades directly linked Tempelsman to the destabilization of Zaire / Congo , Sierra Leone , Angola , Zimbabwe , Namibia , Rwanda and Ghana . ”
For over 35 years Maurice and son Leon Tempelsman worked the diamond connection behind the repression of Mobutu Sese Seko and his Israeli - trained shock troops .
Now , 47 years later , the Tempelsman empire remains rock solid behind three companies : Leon Tempelsman & Sons , De Beers , and Lazare Kaplan International ; LKI supplies Tiffany ’s and Cartier’s .
A client of Adelai Stevenson ’s law firm during the first Congo crises ( 1960 - 1970 ) , Tempelsman later hired Lawrence Devlin , a CIA station chief responsible for covert operations in Katanga , to maintain the Mobutu diamond / cobalt connections into the late 1980’s .
Tempelsman ’s capacity to sway governments and leverage markets is unrivaled .
In 2002 , Tempelsman offered Namibia ’s President Sam Nujoma an $ 80 million interest free “ loan ” to bridge Namibia 's budgetary shortfall against future sales of Namibia ’s gemstones .
Namibia is the leading producer of offshore deep sea diamonds , through DeBeers and Diamond Fields , and South Africa second .
Offshore diamond mining has expanded to Papua New Guinea and New Zealand waters , and global mining investors call it the “ new gold rush , ” but scientists compare deep - sea dredging to destroying an eco-system as complex as a tropical rain forest .
Specialized deep - sea crawler vessels like DeBeers “ The Peace in Africa ” reflect the expertise of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute .
Maurice Tempelsman is an honorary trustee and an honorary member of the corporation of Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution .
Tempelsman is the deep pockets of the Democratic party , a regular supporter of the campaigns of John Kerry ( D ) ; Ed Royce ( R ) ; Tom Daschle ( D ) ; Barack Obama ( D ) ; Maxine Waters ( D ) ; John Rockefeller ( D ) ; Richard Gephardt ( D ) ; Howard Wolpe ( D ) ; Patrick ( D ) and Edward Kennedy ( D ) ; and the 1988 win of George H.W. Bush .
Tempelsman also exploited ties with Anthony Lake , Clinton ’s National Security adviser , who intervened at the U.S. Export - Import Bank on Tempelsman ’s behalf .
Tempelsman contributed some $ 500,000 to Clinton for president , and he is backing Hillary ( D ) .
He traveled at Clinton ’s side on the 1998 Presidential Africa tour — along with National Security Council staffer John Prendergast , now an International Crises Group “ expert ” and leading “ Save Darfur ! ” cheerleader .
The Clinton ’s Botswana visit was not about an Okavango Delta wildlife reserve safari .
Botswana ’s President Mogae attended the 1999 Attracting Capital to Africa Summit in Houston ( TX ) , organized by the Corporate Council on Africa ( CCA ) , the “ who ’s who ” of multinational corporations .
CCA chairman Maurice Tempelsman organized the summit , where 10 African heads of state met with half of Clinton 's Cabinet and 200 corporate representatives .
Tempelsman and the CCA organized the U.S. - Africa Business Summit in Africa in 2001 , featuring DRC President Joseph Kabila , coordinated with an Africa Growth and Opportunity Act ( AGOA ) meeting involving President G. W. Bush and Secretary of State Colin Powel .
Maurice Tempelsman was Jackie O’Nassis Kennedy ’s lover and he reportedly courted Madeline Albright .
Tempelsman is Chairman of the American Jewish Congress , a Zionist pressure group that claims it “ works closely with the Israeli military . ”
He sits on the boards of nationalist American think tanks that also seat Madeleine Albright .
As Vice - Chairman of Lazare Kaplan International , Tempelsman ’s annual base pay is $ 458,833 , with a bonus of $ 80,000 ; as principal director / shareholder in Leon Tempelsman and Sons he gets a comparable amount again .
SEC filings show that LKI directors are high - rolling Zionist lawyers and investment bankers : one director belongs to the law firm that represented President Kennedy — another Tempelsman friend .
LKI is also connected to the euphemistically named United States Agency for International Development ( USAID ) .
Selling to the U.S. Diamond Stockpile and to his private profits , Tempelsman companies have plundered tens of billions of diamond dollars from Congo / Zaire — alone — in the past five decades .
Conditions in Congo today are Leopoldian .
Some Congolese earn as little as $ 2 a month working like slaves for Western companies .
In a recent study , Medicins Sans Frontieres found conditions surveyed across Congo beyond “ emergency ” and into “ catastrophic ” classification .
Since the war ended in 2003 , conditions — in terms of mortality and access to health care — have deteriorated .
People die of malaria , diarrhea , malnutrition , tuberculosis , measles , and the inability to seek or receive treatment .
Conditions in peaceful areas of DRC remain worse than most war zones in the world .
Mortality in Eastern DRC remained over 1000 people per day in April 2007 .
PEACE IS WAR , IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH
In 2001 , the World Peace Foundation Program on Intrastate Conflict at Harvard ’s Kennedy School of Government organized a conference on conflict diamonds that “ involved stakeholders of diverse interests . ” WPF program director Robert Rotberg chaired the meeting .
Rotberg also directs the Kennedy School ’s Belfer Center for Human Rights , whose directors are the core of the defense and intelligence establishment , men like John Deutch , former CIA director , and Richard Darmam , partner , Carlyle Group .
The Harvard diamond conference actually normalized De Beers ’ relations with the U.S. Government : De Beers reps received a special government amnesty to attend the conference after years of exile from the U.S. due to anti-trust law violations .
In 2002 the WPF produced a report Diamonds in Peace and War : Severing the Conflict - Diamond Connection .
The report lauded the Kennedy School ’s efforts based on a rush of activity that followed the conference at the end of November 2001 .
The “ rush of activity ” included the U.S. government ’s Clean Diamond Trade Act ( H.R. 722 ) , born in November 2001 , passed in April 2003 .
All bluster and polish , the Act gave the U.S. President authority to institute “ War on Terror ” sanctions against any country that deals in dirty diamonds .
The U.S. General Accounting Office noted in 2006 that the law is weak and deeply flawed .
Since at least 1996 , the campaigns of Russ Feingold ( D - WI ) , who co-sponsored the Senate version , have been heavily funded by Leon Tempelsman & Son .
The Kennedy school today peddles their report as a comprehensive success .
“ Using diamonds to import arms and sponsor war is less likely now that the Kimberley Process has produced a near - final agreement , ” the current abstract reads .
“ Diamonds in Peace and War is the place to learn all about this remarkably successful initiative of conflict prevention and conflict reduction . ”
Maurice Tempelsman chairs the International Advisory Council at the Harvard AIDS Institute ( HAI ) of the School of Public Health .
HAI partners with the U.S. Military HIV Research Program ( USMHRP ) , a program whose said purpose is to develop vaccines and AIDS prevention for U.S. Military servicemen .
Tempelsman ’s involvement in covert actions and interventions flags this program as cover for clandestine biowarfare in “ emerging ” countries .
When contacted , Robert Rotberg praised the Kimberley Process as a “ remarkable achievement ” and he dismissed any conflict of interest between Tempelsman and the Kimberley initiatives .
“ We invited Maurice Tempelsman to the [ 2001 ] conference , but he chose not to come . ”
Asked about the U.S. Government diamond stockpile , Robert Rotberg indicated that its existence “ is news to me . ”
The U.S. Defense Logistics Agency controls the national diamond stockpiles : some 3.1 million carats are held at the Defense National Stockpile Centers .
Pressed further about Tempelsman , Rotberg replied .
“ There is no contact between this side of the Charles river and that side .
This is not a conspiracy , the real problem is not Maurice Tempelsman : the biggest problem is that the U.S.
Treasury has been really slow to put [ Kimberley ] structures in place . ”
Maurice Tempelsman and Robert Rotberg are members of the Council on Foreign Relations .
No contact between them ?
From 1999 to 2002 the CFR sponsored a series of panels titled “ Roundtable on Private Capital Flows to Sub-Saharan Africa . ”
The panels ’ director was Mahesh Kotecha and Chair was Maurice Tempelsman .
At the time , Tempelsman was funding the CFR ’s Africa Program .
Panelists included Walter Kansteiner , Robert Rotberg , Frank Wisner and Botswana ’s President Festus Mogae .
The Vice President of Botswana , Lt. General S.K.I Khama , is on the board of U.S. - based Conservation International , a corporate “ conservation ” organization whose tiny smokescreen “ ecotourism ” project is used to tout their support in helping the San Bushmen .
Conservation International directors include Louis Cabot , whose Cabot Corporation benefited from the plunder of columbium - tantalite ( coltan ) from Congo .
The Kotecha family is directly involved with illegal networks pillaging coltan from Congo .
Walter Kansteiner — National Security Council African Affairs director under Clinton — is today director of Moto Gold , a company involved in Congo ’s blood - drenched Ituri region , and the Kansteiner family of Chicago trades in coltan .
Walter Kansteiner was the U.S. President ’s “ personal representative ” to the G - 8 Africa Process , and he is a founding principal of the Scowcroft Group , under Brent Scowcroft , former National Security Adviser to G. H. W. Bush and Gerald Ford .
Kansteiner also works for the Center for Strategic and International Studies Africa Policy Advisory Panel .
Panelist Frank Wisner was also on the National Security Council under Clinton .
Wisner ’s co-directors of the American International Group include : Marshall Cohen , a director of the Bush - connected Barrick Gold Corporation and Canadian Government Official ; Harvard Professor Martin Stuart Feldstein ; Clinton Cabinet members William Cohen and Richard Holbrooke ; and Carla Hills , NAFTA negotiator and director of Chevron - Texaco and the International Crises Group , a flak organization active in all Africa ’s hotspots .
( William ) Cohen Group partners include former top Pentagon officers , White House officials , U.K. Lords , NATO Chiefs , and directors of Lockheed Martin and Dyncorp .
Note that Dyncorp director Mark Ronald was previously President / CEO of BAE Systems .
Another Cohen Group director , Gen. ( ret. )
Paul Kern , participated in operations in Rwanda and Zaire .
Frank Wisner ’s father was CIA director of the Office of Policy Coordination , an early covert operations bureau ; Operation Mockingbird , designed to infiltrate and control the U.S. media , was one of theirs .
Frank Wisner — a USAID and state department official in Vietnam — was involved with the black - operations Pheonix assassinations program .
Tempelsman ’s affiliation with Robert Rotberg at the CFR explains the absence of any mention of Tempelsman or his diamond interests in the Kimberly - related conferences , policies and papers that came out of the Kennedy School .
Seven Harvard professionals , including Michael Ignatief , and Samantha Power , who won a Pulitzer for her whitewash of the U.S. - backed coup in Rwanda , took part in the 2001 Kennedy School conference that led to Diamonds in Peace and War , the report that whitewashed Maurice Tempelsman ’s involvement .

BLOOD DIAMOND Part Two :
Appeared July 1 , 2007
Z Magazine ( abridged and edited ) :
http://zmagsite.zmag.org/JulAug2007/snow.html
MINING THE APOCALYPSE
Over the past fifty years , top Israeli , American , French and Belgian diamond dealers have perpetrated conflict and injustice in Africa , fueled by and for diamonds .
According to a report by the American Jewish Committee : after 1980 “ Mossad agents , military emissaries , and a small group of private businessmen … replaced diplomats as Israel ’s main interlocutors with African leaders and political ( mainly opposition ) groups . ”
The report cites rising involvement of private defense and security interests , especially in Angola , DRC and Central Africa Republic , since 1992 .
Retired Israeli Defense Forces Colonel Yair Klein reportedly organized arms for diamonds networks in Sierra Leone and Liberia after President Charles Taylor was deposed .
President in 1997 , Taylor was imprisoned in Massachusetts in 1984 for embezzlement in Liberia , but “ escaped ” mysteriously .
He was close with President Blaise Compaoré of Burkina Faso , which is Israel ’s base of operations in Africa and a conduit for illegal stones .
Yair Klein violated the U.N. embargo by trading arms for diamonds from the Revolutionary United Front ( RUF ) , the rebels in Sierra Leone who chopped people ’s hands off , as depicted the film .
In 1999 Klein was arrested in Sierra Leone on charges of smuggling arms to the RUF ; transactions went through Ibrahim Bah , a Senegalese Soldier of Fortune — and purported Al Qaeda businessman .
Lebanese diamond middlemen in both Sierra Leone and DRC are linked to Hezbollah .
The U.N. documented collaborations between Sierra Leone ’ rebels , Tempelsman companies , and Tempelsman ’s Lazare Kaplan diamond agent Damian Gagnon .
The Congo ’s state diamond mining company , Societe Miniere De Bakwanga ( MIBA ) , has been cited for shooting ‘ illegal ’ diamond workers on its concessions in Mbuju Mayi , the diamond capital of Congo .
“ Every day , hundreds of unemployed Congolese take similar risks in the diamond fields of Mbuji - Mayi , ” wrote Amnesty International in 2002 .
“ And every day , dozens of gunshots ring out as guards employed by MIBA seek to deter illegal miners . ”
The BBC in August 2006 reported that MIBA security guards were sniping unemployed diamond miners .
MIBA security is run by one of the many DRC interests of Belgian billionaire tycoon Philippe de Moerloose .
A member of the Kinshasa elite , De Moerloose supplies jets and other presidential toys to DRC President Kabila .
Multinational mining giants De Beers and BHP - Billiton both have partnered with MIBA .
In 2003 , as the Kimberley Process crystallized , MIBA signed an exclusive contract with Canadian Emaxon , a subsidiary of Dan Gertler Israel ( DGI ) Group .
But the expansion of Gertler companies in Congo began in 2000 , when former Congolese president Laurent Kabila offered Gertler ’s International Diamond Industries ( IDI ) a monopoly on Congolese diamonds , and 88 % of the proceeds , in exchange for Israeli military assistance to his new government .
The DRC government expelled IDI ’s competitors from Congo : smuggling and fraud proliferated as thousands of poor artisanal miners suffered increasing coercion , violence and exclusion .
Gertler pledged military assistance through retired General Yosi Ben-Hanan , Avigdor Lieberman — Deputy Prime Minister of Israel since November 2006 and leader of Israel ’s far - right nationalist party Beitenu — and Yossi Kamisa , a former Israeli policeman in the Anti-Terrorism Unit and advisor to the Ministry of National Infrastructures director general .
Though the deal was revoked in April 2001 — President Laurent Kabila was assassinated that January — Gertler formed DGI and partnered with other top Israeli military officials and moved ahead .
Claiming he was cut out of the deal to train the Congolese army , Kamisa filed a multi-million dollar lawsuit against Dan Gertler , Foreign Defense Assistance and Defense Export Organization ( SIBAT ) , and SIBAT ’s director - general Gen. ( ret. ) Yosi Ben-Hanan .
Kamisa ’s assistance was conditional on Gertler obtaining a diamond mining franchise in Congo : an agreement was indeed signed granting Gertler a diamond mining franchise worth about $ US 1 billion .
Kamisa , in January 2001 , said SIBAT rejected his application to set up and train the Congo Army on the grounds that it violated Israel 's defense export policy .
Meanwhile , Mossad Chief Meir Dagan and Gen. ( ret. ) Yanush Avigdor Ben -Gal applied to train the Congo Army in Israel and in Congo , in cooperation with Gertler .
By 2002 Gertler ’s company was the leading exporter of Congolese gems .
Top Congolese military officials apparently flew to Israel in 2000 to negotiate the deal , and Gertler reportedly bribed Congolese officials and Angola Army generals who commanded Angola Army troops protecting the Congo capital Kinshasa .
Note that Angola sent troops to Congo in July 2006 to quell any possible rebellion by a Congolese public angered by Western interests ’ engineering of Congo ’s “ historic national elections . ”
AngloGold=AngloAmerican=De Beers=Oppenheimers
Dan Gertler and partner Beny Steinmetz control DGI , Gertler Brothers , Beny Steinmetz Global Resources , Nikanor and Global Enterprises Corporate ( GEC ) , companies with massive diamond , and copper / cobalt concessions in Katanga , some in partnership with John Bredenkamp and Billy Rautenbach .
The Gertler Brothers are Israeli property tycoons .
The privatized Congolese mining parastatal GECAMINES is minority partner , and J.P. Morgan Chase is involved .
George Forrest ’s Kinross - Forrest Group also joined the fray .
Forrest companies made the U.N. hit list of Congo ’s looters .
Forrest has munitions factories in East Africa and has partnered in DRC with OM - Group of Ohio , USA .
A pillar of exploitation in Congo since 1922 , Forrest bankrolled Joseph Kabila ’s election “ victory ” .
A holding company for DRC properties , Nikanor ’s stock prices rose early in July 2006 in expectation of a July 30 “ win ” for Joseph Kabila .
Dan Kurtzer — former U.S. ambassador to Israel — is on Nikanor ’s board .
Maurice Tempelsman was for decades the unofficial ambassador to Congo / Zaire ; Dan Gertler has usurped that role .
In 2000 Gertler was named Honorary Consul to the Congo .
Beny Steinmetz may be the biggest De Beers “ sightholder ” .
Africa Confidential called President Kabila ’s 2003 visit to the Bush White House a “ coup ” for Gertler and Steinmetz .
Gertler ’s best friend is Brooklyn - born Chaim Leibowitz , a personal friend of Condoleeza Rice .
In 2003 , Rice introduced Gertler and Leibowitz to Jendayi Frasier , a former NSC agent focused on Africa , and a Harvard Kennedy School affiliate .
Frasier was one of seven special G. W. Bush delegates sent to Kinshasa for the inauguration of President Joseph Kabila on 6 December 2006 ; Phelps Dodge mining executive John Fenn was another .
Tempelsman and Steinmetz bought diamonds from both sides during Angola ’s thirty - year war .
Israeli diamond tycoons Gertler and Leviev are reportedly jockeying for power with Isabel Dos Santos , the high - rolling diamond - studded daughter of the President of Angola .
Given U.S. support for Rwanda and Uganda , and the U.S. alliance with Israel , Dan Gertler ’s backing the Congolese army to fight rebel groups backed by Rwanda and Uganda amounts to the U.S. and Israel backing both sides in Congo ’s holocaust .
Dan Gertler ’s grandfather , Moshe Schnitzer , is known in Israel as “ Mr. Diamond ; ” in youth he joined the Irgun , an Israeli military cell responsible for terrorism ; he later founded the Israel Diamond Exchange in Tel Aviv , which today brings Israel $ 13 billion annually in commerce , and is the country ’s second - largest industry .
Israel buys some 50 % of the world ’s rough diamonds , and the U.S. buys two - thirds of these .
Moshe Schnitzer ’s son and Dan Gertler ’s uncle is Shmuel Schnitzer , Vice - Chairman of the Belgian - based World Diamond Council — the entity that promotes the false image of “ clean ” or “ conflict - free ” diamonds .
“ The Congo is producing $ 1 - billion a year in diamonds , ” Victor Kasongo , chief executive officer of DRC ’s Centre d'Evaluation , d'Expertise Et de Certification , told Reuters at a rough diamond conference in Tel Aviv in 2004 .
The World Diamond Council lists Congolese businessman Victor Kasongo as a ‘ member . ’
DRC mines minister , Simon Tuma - Waku is “ special adviser ” to one Gertler / Steinmetz project in DRC .
Dan Gertler ’s forays into the bloody world of diamonds involve Israeli arms dealer Yair Klein — the retired Israeli Defense Forces Colonel mentioned above — who is reportedly wanted by the U.S. for training Medellin drug - cartel militias in Colombia .
Klein was convicted by Israel ( 1991 ) for his involvement with Columbian groups that targeted and assassinated Colombian politicians , journalists , and police .
Klein was jailed in 1999 in Sierra Leone : Klein was a field representative for Gertler in war - torn Sierra Leone and Liberia .
Gertler also mingles with the Russian Military Brotherhood , a group of “ retired Russian generals whom Gertler describes as good friends . ”
Another partner in the Israeli - American networks of the Gertler and Steinmetz brothers is Israeli - born Nir Livnat , managing director of Johannesburg - based Ascot Diamonds , a member of the Steinmetz Group of Diamond Companies : Livnat is connected to a string of Israeli - Americans — lawyers , investment bankers and venture capitalists — running companies from Florida to New York , Toronto to Tel Aviv .
According to Chaim Evan -Zohar of Diamond .
Com , “ The Steinmetz Group is known as ' the master ' in the field of diamonds and is one the leading customers of De Beers .
The Steinmetz Group has several sources of independent mines that supply the rough diamonds .
Whenever a large sale , auction or event appears in the diamond business , you can be sure that the Steinmetz Group is part of it .
The Steinmetz Group supports Diamond.com as the Jeweler of the Millennium Diamonds . ”
The Millenium Star diamond was discovered in the Mbuji - Mayi region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo — then Zaire — in 1990 in alluvial deposits ; uncut it was 777 carat ( 155.4 g ) .
The blue “ Millenium Star ” diamond unveiled in 2000 is 203.04 carats .
Other blue diamonds have been auctioned at between $ 560,000 to $ 580,000 per carat , but never has a diamond of this size or quality been sold .
Nicky Oppenheimer of De Beers “ was careful not to put a value on the Millennium Star , saying that any figure he would give would be purely academic .
The London Evening Star was not as conservative as Mr. Oppenheimer and insured the Star for 100 million English pounds .
This is believed to be a fraction of its true worth . ”
The cutting and polishing process for the “ Millenium Star ” series diamonds took three years , and was led by Nir Livnat .
Nir Livnat is also a director of Anglovaal Mining with Rick and Brian Menell .
The other principals on Anglovaal are South African and Canadian .
The Anglovaal Chairman is Kennedy Maxwell , head of the gold and uranium division of Johannesburg Consolidated Investments ( JCI ) and a member of the S.A. Mining Industry ’s Chamber of Mines ’ controlling executive .
Anglovaal director David N. Murray , who lives in the U.K. , is also director of Canada ’s Ivernia Company , whose directors include Canadian Senator J. Trevor Eaton .
Senator Eyton is a board member of a number of corporations , including Coca - Cola Enterprises ( Atlanta ) , General Motors of Canada , Noranda Mining , Nestle Canada , and the Bush - connected Barrick Gold Corporation , whose directors include Brian Mulroney .
Barrick , of course , is partnered up with Anglo - American Ashanti in Congo .
Brian Mulroney , former Prime Minister of Canada , appointed Eaton to the Senate of Canada in 1991 ; Mulroney is also a director of Barrick Gold .
Other Barrick directors include Vernon Jordan and former U.S. Senator Howard Baker .
Mulroney is also a director of Archers Daniels Midland , with former Ambassador and Mayor of Atlanta Andrew Young .
The corporate clients of Young ’s consulting firm Goodworks International include the Government of Angola , Coca - Cola , Barrick Gold , Chevron - Texaco and Guinness International — one of the branded products advertised in the storyline of the film Blood Diamond .
Andrew Young has been very close with the Museveni and Kagame officials plundering diamonds and other natural resources out of Congo .
Brian Menell , Nir Livnat ’s associate on the board of Anglovaal , is on the board of ENERGEM with Tony Teixeira , and like Teixeira he is involved in numerous other companies and interlocking directorships .
That ties Teixeira into networks supporting both Kabila and Bemba .
Brian Menell is also on the board of First Africa Oil , which operates in seven African countries , and First Africa Oil director John Bentley is on the board of Adastra Minerals — formerly America Mineral Fields ( AMF , AMFI , AMX ) based at one time in Hope , Arkansas and another time in London , and set up by “ friends of Bill Clinton ” Robert Friedland and Max and Jean - Raymond Boulle .
John Bentley is also a director of Osprey Oil and Gas , whose directors include Carol Bell , a director of Chase Manhattan Bank .
De Beers holds twelve diamond concessions in DRC ’s blood - drenched Kasai provinces ; Emaxon also holds concessions in the Kasais .
One of DRC ’s largest diamond concessions , Kasai Shield , involves Australia ’s Gravity Diamonds with BHP - Billiton , Mwana Africa , and MIBA , and through these BHP - Billiton links to AngloGold , Barrick Gold , and Moto Gold ( Kansteiner ) in Ituri .
BHP - Billiton directors include : Paul Andersen , U.S. President ’s Advisory Council for Science and Technology , and David Jenkins , Halliburton Corp. Halliburton subsidiary Brown and Root backed the Rwandan Patriotic Front coups d’etat in Rwanda ( 1994 ) and Zaire ( 1996 ) : millions of innocent people were slaughtered .
The numbers of dead from Congo ’s wars — which began with the U.S. - backed invasion of 1996 and continue to today — likely exceed ten million .
DEPOPULATION IS A DIAMOND ( MAGNATES ) BEST FRIEND
While plundering DRC , Uganda ’s diamond exports to Belgium tripled , and their weapons imports rose , Uganda denied everything , the Western media reported nothing , and Uganda ’s backers kept the “ development aid ” flowing .
Friendly with Israel for years , Uganda has bought Mi-17 transport helicopters and armaments from Silver Shadow , an Israeli PMC registered with SIBAT , and one of many PMC ’s reportedly in DRC .
In 1999 , Uganda purchased seven MiG jet fighters from Belarus , and four were modified in Israel to increase their firepower .
The Uganda governments ’ terrorism in Congo is matched by decades of internal state terrorism in Northern Uganda ; as of April 25 some 2300 Ugandan troops were involved in the U.S. deconstruction of Somalia ; Uganda is also involved in Sudan .
With their constant military presence in eastern DRC since 1996 , establishing informal networks to plunder , extort , and terrorize , top Rwandan officials and cronies shipped Congo ’s stones from Kigali to Belgium on Sabena — the Belgian National Airline that carried Congolese nationalist Patrice Lumumba to his own murder in 1961 .
Kagame ’s elite network funds their killing machine with illicit diamonds , coltan and timber , and extortion through commercial levies in Congo .
According to the U.N. Panel of Experts on Illegal Exploitation of DRC , they set up a “ Congo desk ” run by Lebanese diamond merchant Aziz Nassour , purportedly linked to Al Qaeda .
Nassour was displaced by Israeli diamond dealer , Philippe Surowicz , remembered for his ‘ reign of terror ’ in collusion with the RPA military .
The “ Congo Desk ” replaced Surowicz with a Lebanese , Hamad Khalil , backed by comptoirs in Kisangani .
Lebanese and Indian traders in Congo / Zaire operate as middlemen — mafia networks that proliferated under Mobutu — and these networks were reorganized by war in DRC .
Middlemen , backed by military structures , maintain a stranglehold over poor Congolese artisans .
Stones move into international trade through Belgian , Israeli and Russian buyers working for the bigger diamond concerns like Lazare Kaplan , De Beers , and Emaxon .
Another godless force in the African diamond plunder is Pat Robertson , evangelist minister with the Christian Coalition .
A Mobutu confidant , Robertson ’s African Development Corp. used the “ humanitarian ” cover of “ Operation Blessing ” to plunder diamonds during Congo ’s bloodbath .
He worked closely with Charles Taylor ( 1997-2003 ) .
Robertson ’s Freedom Gold , is today bleeding Liberia .
The resource thefts from DRC occurred amidst slavery , crimes against humanity , and genocide committed under the direct oversight of Presidents Paul Kagame and Yoweri Museveni , their generals James Kabarebe , James Kazini , Charles Kayonga , and Museveni ’s half - brother Salim Saleh .
Israel ’s Verona Commodities reportedly brokered arms shipments to Rwanda , but weapons are routed to the killing fields of Darfur , Congo , Uganda , Ethiopia and Somalia through a vast array of companies and countries , including Israel , U.S. , Canada and the U.K .
As everywhere , weapons destabilize and depopulate : as of March 2007 , landmines and unexploded ordinance remained heavily concentrated in Congo , maiming innocent people .
While the system has seen various facelifts , little has changed .
Diamonds out of DRC today continue to fuel warfare beyond the DRC ’s borders , while Congolese artisans suffer under an average life expectancy of about 42 years .
At the Antwerp Diamond Conference in November 2003 , Bill Clinton praised the Kimberley Process for breaking the link between diamonds and brutal African wars .
This was reminiscent of his disingenuous speech ( 1998 ) about “ the failure of the U.S. to stop genocide ” in Rwanda ; Maurice Tempelsman spoke after Clinton .
Westerners concerned about the Holocaust — and genocide in Darfur — will find in Africa many judicious applications of the Nazi term Lebensraum , or “ living space , ” the concept of killing people off to clear land and acquire raw materials .
STONES OF MISFORTUNE
The companies of Tony Buckingham and partner Antonio Teixeira operate through subsidiaries and joint ventures .
One , DiamondWorks , counts Beny Steinmetz as a 50 % shareholder .
Through subsidiary Branch Energy , DiamondWorks has perpetuated war in 11 African countries , places like Equatorial Guinea , where the bloodbath is whitewashed by U.S. - based Cassidy and Associates PR campaigns at some $ 120,000 a month .
Dan Gertler ’s Emaxon company “ won ” the Kasai Shield project over rivals De Beers and Energem , a Buckingham - Teixeira diamond firm with J. P. Morgan as shareholder .
Social “ unrest ” in Kasai is a product of outside interventions , not African tribalism .
DRC ’s rebel warlord Jean - Pierre Bemba is married to Lillian Teixeira , the daughter of Antonio Teixeira .
Sandline International is the follow - on to Executive Outcomes — the Soldiers - of - Fortune portrayed in Blood Diamond .
Mercenaries Tony Buckingham and Tim Spicer were partners in Executive Outcomes , and their Sandline has backed insurgencies in Africa .
A Buckingham interest , Heritage Oil & Gas , is reportedly tied to the Carlyle Group and part of a major thrust to control oil and natural gas from the Red Sea , through Darfur , to the Great Lakes of Africa .
Heritage is pumping on the Uganda - DRC border and in Congo - Brazzaville , and Buckingham interests have also worked in Angola and Sierra Leone .
The mining mafia of “ Friends of Bill Clinton ” — criminal networks of offshore subsidiaries and joint ventures — are run by international “ financiers ” like Max and Jean - Raymond Boulle , Robert Friedland , and Michael McMurrough , and their companies operate in all the wrong places : Burma , Angola , Sierra Leone , Congo , Papua New Guinea .
America Mineral Fields ( AMF ) , renamed ADASTRA , partnered with AngloAmerican in DRC , and was recently bought by First Quantum of Canada .
The Rothchilds Group and Meryl Lynch Bank are also involved .
First Quantum directors are also directors of Tahera Diamond , one of many start - up diamond firms plundering Canada ’s northern territories .
Tahera ’s directors include former Rothschild ’s and current Lundin Mining directors .
Rothchilds ’ diamond interests are linked with Holland ’s ABN AMRO Bank , which counts a British Lord , a Dutch Parliamentarian , and an advisor to the Harvard Business School on its board .
Jean - Raymond Boulle , Maurice Tempelsman , Walter Kansteiner , Ed Royce ( R ) and Corporate Council on Africa members like Halliburton , Boeing , Cargill and Freeport McMoran —
these are the architects of the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act ( AGOA ) , America ’s NAFTA for Africa .
Freeport McMoran directors include International Rescue Committee and CSIS adviser Henry Kissinger .
The AGOA destroys local markets , erects discriminatory trade barriers , undermines local economies to enrich elites and impoverish the masses — a.k.a. in the language of diamondthink , the AGOA promotes free - trade .
CANADA’S GOLDEN GOOSE
When Warner Brothers launched its pre-release advertising of Blood Diamond in the fall of 2006 , the diamond industry launched its pre-emptive strike .
CNN News and the New York Times began peddling Canada as an “ alternative ” source for “ clean ” diamonds .
“ When Mr. Walker , a medical student went shopping , ” wrote the NYT on 14 December 2006 , “ he knew it would be a ‘ conscience issue ’ for his fiancée , he said .
He bought a Canadian diamond with a certificate . ”
The same NYT article apologized for diamond polishing in India by promoting a notion of workers freed from hunger and “ because many Africans depend on diamonds for their livelihood , ” the NYT pontificated , “ a boycott is not the answer . ”
This is NYT columnist Nicholas Kristof ’s happy , expedient theme : “ the only thing worse than exploitation — is no exploitation !
Two cheers for sweatshops ! ”
Again and again we are blessed to find that the people responsible for causing mayhem become the bearers of our salvation !
In South Africa , De Beers diamonds are embedded in asbestos , and hundreds of thousands of miners have suffered miserably or died from cancer , leukemia and silicosis over the decades of De Beers operations .
In India , where 90 % of all diamonds are finely cut — for about 40 cents each , often by child slaves — cutters suffer and die of silicosis caused by inhalation of gem dust .
Diamonds from South Africa and India are officially certified ‘ clean ’ and ‘ safe ’ .
“ The most effective means of helping communities is giving them a hand up , not a handout , ” says De Beers ’ PR about the open pit mining spreading through Canada ’s First Nations .
“ This is a cornerstone of De Beers ’ approach to social sustainability .
The idea is to build capacity , not dependency , in the communities with which the company interacts . ”
Alvin Fiddler , a leader of the Nishnawbe Aski Nation in Canada ’s boreal forest , rejects the spit- and - polish of De Beers PR for what it is : conflict and strife , a lot of spit rubbed into the wounds of his people .
“ The Nishnawbe Aski Nation communities are among the poorest in the world , ranked 69th in the U.N. 's Human Development Index , with the lowest life expectancy in Canada , the highest youth suicide rates in the world , and an unemployment rate of more than 60 percent .
With diamonds on our lands our communities should be wealthy . ”
De Beers ’ program to clear - cut boreal forest and open pit mine the Nishnawbe Aski Nation is not only ripping apart the land ; court battles , corruption and greed are tearing apart the people .
De Beers ’ violated treaties and trespassed ; helicopters and drill rigs destroyed the spring goose hunt on which the community depends for winter food .
De Beers ’ pumping out boreal swamps means salination and sludge spoiling the Attawapiskat River fishing .
Some 260,000 hectares of pristine Canadian wildernesses will be devastated for diamonds .
Northern Canada is seeing an explosion of diamond mining by unscrupulous firms and offshore companies , with government complicity : another page in the ongoing North American genocide .
“ The diamond industry has failed to deliver on its promises to combat blood diamonds , ” says Corinna Gilfillan of Global Witness , a non-government member of the Kimberley delegations , “ and instead has launched a PR campaign to undermine and convince the public that blood diamonds are no longer a problem .
Contrary to the industry 's misleading and disingenuous PR campaign , diamonds are still fuelling conflict today . ”
But Global Witness ( GW ) itself appears to be under the sway of De Beers and Tempelsman .
GW supports the Kimberley Process , approving the “ legitimate government ” stamping of diamonds — and this only institutionalizes structural violence .
It seems , indeed , that Global Witness was used by the diamond industry : the involvement of Global Witness in the Kimberley Process , and in Kennedy School initiatives , likely benefits powerful factions seeking to leverage access to the diamond cartel , or exclude challengers from it .
GW ’s representatives attended the 2001 Kennedy School conference on conflict diamonds and participated in the creation of the Kimberley Process , but they would not respond to questions about Tempelsman ’s relationship to the Harvard Conference or the Kimberley Process .
And Global Witness nowhere mentions or challenges Maurice Tempelsman .
On inspection it ’s easy to see why : they can’t .
Big foundations have a keen purpose .
Sponsors of Global Witness include the National Endowment for Democracy , Gleitsman Foundation , Open Society Institute , and the Tempelsman - friendly USAID .
George Soros ’ OSI funds sprang out of currency speculation that plundered Eastern European economies ; Soros is an International Crises Group ( ICG ) director , and an insider in Russian affairs .
The Gleitsman Foundation supports Harvard 's Kennedy School .
The National Endowment for Democracy is more problematic : NED and its partners facilitate political intervention in foreign countries .
The NED ’s core affiliate Center for International Private Enterprise works , for example , with USAID in Afghanistan , and is linked to Bechtel ( Nexant ) .
The NED ’s core affiliate the National Democratic Institute counts Maurice Tempelsman and Madeleine Albright as directors .
Richard Gephardt is on the boards of NDI and NED , both of which funded Congo ’s “ historic national elections ” from 2004 to 2006 , and have been funding the opposition MDC party in Zimbabwe for years .
NED directors tied to Tempelsman include : Howard Wolpe ; Richard Holbrooke ; and Morton Abramowitz .
Wolpe was Clinton ’s Special Envoy to Africa ’s Great Lakes Region , and director of the “ Africa and U.S. National Interests ” project of the Ninetieth American Assembly , where some 69 reps from elite military , intelligence and corporate interests attended closed - door think - tank proceedings : Maurice Tempelsman funded it .
Holbrooke , Wolpe , Abramowitz , John Deutch ( Rotberg connection ) are “ experts ” for the intelligence consulting firm , Intellibridge , founded by Tempelsman ’s confidante Anthony Lake .
Wolpe is on the board of Africare , and so is Joseph Kennedy .
Holbrooke is President / CEO of the Global Business Council on AIDS , whose director Mark Moody Stuart is a director of Anglo - American mining and former director of Royal / Dutch Shell ( ret. 2005 ) .
Holbrooke and Tempelsman are on the board of the Africa - America Institute , along with former USAID official Gayle Smith , Clinton ’s National Security negotiator for Rwanda and Uganda , member of the CFR and the Corporate Council on Africa , whose Chair is Maurice Tempelsman .
Global Witness is not a serious threat to extractive industries , and that is why GW was advertised in the film Blood Diamond .
The message is “ do n’t you worry about blood diamonds ( or big oil ) : Global Witness is on it . ”
In fact , like the big foundations that fund them , GW plays an important role as a shaper of public policy .
But can they be effective , given their sources of income ?
“ The blood diamonds campaign by Global Witness has protected De Beers , and it has had De Beers ’ full support publicly , ” says blood diamond expert Janine Roberts .
“ Although privately GW has been very critical of De Beers , they are not critical publicly . ”
After reviewing the above critique , Global Witness removed the National Endowment for Democracy from the “ Our Funders ” section on their web site ( NED remains listed in their Annual Reports ) .
All evidence suggests that the diamond industry has no intention of substantive change .
Indeed , in June 2002 , as the Kimberley Process was unfolding in earnest , Daniel Horowitz , CEO of IDH Diamonds , gave a speech at the 3rd World Diamond Conference which reveals what the industry is trying so desperately to hide .
A diamond distributor for the powerful Rio Tinto mining group , IDH works with Endiama , BHP - Billiton , De Beers and others .
The speech was titled “ Rough Diamonds in a Brave New World . ”
“ Ladies and gentlemen , it would be irresponsible to circumvent the fact that it is highly problematic , if not unfeasible , to work out a system in order to control the flow of rough diamonds around the world .
The reality is that once diamonds are mined there is almost nothing one can do in order to prevent them from reaching the market .
No certification scheme can truly be reliable , not only because war - torn areas are by definition disorganized , but mainly because it is intrinsically impossible to distinguish between good and bad diamonds .
Misguiding traders and consumers with untrustworthy guarantees would inevitably be demystified over time . ”
“ As opposed to this , it is critical to publicize that the mainstream diamond trade is legitimate .
It needs to be said again and again that conflict diamonds are an irrelevant portion of world production .
And as far as humanitarian issues are concerned , the added value the industry generates worldwide particularly benefits the developing world . ”
Daniel Horowitz mapped out the public relations strategy now in play .
Instead of addressing the structural factors that create and perpetuate misery in those far off places , the industry chose — as corporations and governments routinely do — to spend millions of its profits to manage public perceptions .
Because the origins of no diamond can be traced or documented , as Horowitz confirmed , any diamond — from Liberia or Congo or Botswana or First Nations — can be rubber - stamped with a falsified certificate of origin : CANADA .
Blood Diamond was no exposé on the glitter and greed of capitalism .
It was a necessary part of a massive PR campaign to manage public perceptions , displace competitors edging in on the big diamond cartels , and make a lot of money .
Indeed , just as the blood diamond campaign was grinding into high gear the “ rebel ” diamond mafias were expediently linked to Al Qaeda : the media fanned the frenzy , saturating consumers with baseless stories about Islamic terrorists dealing in dirty diamonds .
The big mining syndicates were the winners .
Health care , education , and development for “ emerging ” nations — such blanket claims have for years emanated from the “ good governance ” and “ social responsibility ” departments of all extractive industries .
Full - page New York Times ads cost some $ 75,000 for a single appearance , $ 127,000 for a two - page spread .
The reality is that more money is pumped into advertising diamonds as “ clean ” and “ conflict - free ” than is spent on development in Africa ’s diamond zones .
And there is not a single example of De Beers legitimately “ building capacity ” anywhere in the world , no matter what the New York Times tells us .
“ The Kimberley Process put in place in 2003 has prevented diamonds from fueling conflicts and financing terrorist networks , ” announced the New York Times in their shameful cover story of 27 March 2007 .
Headlined DIAMONDS MOVE FROM BLOOD TO SWEAT AND TEARS , the front page story jumps to page eight — with six ads for Tiffany and Cartier between and a $ 75,000 Tiffany ad after — wherein it says : “ Some countries like Botswana have been able to make their [ diamond ] deposits a source of wealth , through careful management and control . ”
Careful management and control : remember the Bushmen and their “ places of death ? ”
Even if the diamond industry did change — more than cosmetically — there are still all those millions of blood diamonds locked in the vaults of the diamond bourses to insure the artificially high , monopoly - fixed , prices of diamonds , our otherwise worthless rocks of desire .
These little rocks , greedily hoarded over the past decades , are tainted , hexed , cursed with bad karma .
Walk into a diamond retailer and ask about blood diamonds and you will be told , with a nervous laugh , and an audacious lie , “ well , that ’s all been cleaned up . ”
Because Canadian diamonds are conflict free , all diamonds are conflict - free .
Look down at your new diamond and think of your relationship , and love , and happiness ever after , just like someone else did — when they found your diamond in Africa . ~
