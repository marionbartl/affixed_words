Just two weeks after his historic election , US president - elect Barack Obama yesterday confirmed he would have Republicans in his administration and admitted there were times when he did not know where to begin in trying to deal with the enormous challenges awaiting him in the White House .
In his first interview since the election , Obama acknowledged the daunting nature of assuming office at a time of war and global economic crisis .
" The challenges that we are confronting are enormous and they are multiple .
And so there are times during the course of a given day where you think : ' Where do I start in terms of moving - moving things forward ? ' , " the president - elect told CBS television 's 60 Minutes programme .
He said conversations with past presidents had persuaded him there was a " certain loneliness " to being in the White House .
" You 'll get advice , and you 'll get counsel , " he said .
" Ultimately , you 're the person who 's going to be making decisions .
And - and I think that - even now , you know , I ... you can already feel that fact . "
The interview , which also featured Obama 's wife , Michelle , was a mixture of the personal as well as the political .
The couple , who had some good - natured sparring , also said the fact that he was president - elect had not yet entirely sunk in .
However , Obama said he began to gain a sense of what his victory meant for many Americans on election night when his mother - in - law reached over to squeeze his hand .
" You had this sense of , well , what 's she thinking ?
For a black woman who grew up in the 50s , in a segregated Chicago , to watch her daughter become first lady of the United States , " he said .
" There was that sense across the country . "
It became apparent , however , that the economy would remain the most pressing concern of the 64 days remaining until Obama takes office on January 20 , and once he enters the White House .
Obama brushed aside comparisons between the current crisis and the Great Depression of the 1930s .
He also ruled out a New Deal type solution but said he wanted to send a message to Americans that " we 're going to be thinking about them and what they 're going through " .
" For us to simply recreate what existed back in the 30s in the 21st century - I think would be missing the boat , " Obama said .
" I think the basic principle that government has a role to play in kick - starting an economy that has ground to a halt is sound .
I think our basic principle that this is a free market system and that that has worked for us , that it creates innovation and risk taking - I think that 's a principle that we 've got to hold to as well . "
He said that George Bush 's bail - out plan was not doing enough for ordinary Americans , and that as a first step he was determined to bring in measures that would help homeowners avoid falling behind on their mortgages and losing their homes , Obama said .
" We have not focused on foreclosures and what 's happening to homeowners as much as I would like , " he said .
" One thing I 'm determined is that if we do n't have a clear , focused programme for homeowners by the time I take office , we will after I take office . "
Obama offered similar reassurances for early action on unemployment in the Democrats ' weekly radio address on Saturday .
The president - elect , in a break with tradition , also videotaped the speech and posted it online .
However , he was less forthcoming about a bail - out for America 's struggling car makers .
" For the auto industry to completely collapse would be a disaster in this kind of environment , " he told CBS .
" We need to provide assistance , but I think that it can't be a blank cheque . "
Other priorities in terms of policy included Guantanamo .
Obama renewed his campaign pledge to close the detention centre .
" I have said repeatedly that I will close Guantanamo and I will follow through on that , " he said .
In terms of immediate challenges , Obama listed among his first priorities in the transition the need to put a national security team in place .
" Transition periods are traditionally times of vulnerability in terms of terrorist attack so we want to make sure that there is as seamless as a transition as possible , " he said .
Obama has spent virtually all of his time since the election in Chicago .
After 22 months of frenetic activity on the campaign trail , he welcomed the period as a time for his family to return to some semblance of a normal life .
" There seem to be more people hovering around me , " the president - elect said .
" On the other hand , I 'm sleeping in my own bed . "
While in Chicago , Obama has been focused on assembling his team in the White House and the cabinet .
He told CBS he would have at least one Republican in his cabinet , making good his pledge to welcome powerful personalities with competing views to his White House .
But he gave no further details last night .
Obama also gave away nothing about whether Hillary Clinton was on his shortlist of candidates for the post of secretary of state .
The impression that Obama was leaning towards a " team of rivals " including even his most formidable opponent - Clinton - grew over the weekend with neither camp trying to damp down speculation .
However , Obama said only that he valued Clinton 's advice .
Another potential contender for secretary of state , the New Mexico governor , Bill Richardson , has also met Obama to discuss the post .
So far , Obama 's transition team has focused on filling positions at the White House which are not contingent on confirmation by the Senate .
The choices since then have revealed a mix of campaign loyalists and veterans of Bill Clinton 's administration .

BBC News , Erez Crossing
Erez is usually closed to all but medical cases , diplomats and journalists
Over the last six days , Israel has all but closed its crossings with the Gaza Strip .
No fuel ( paid for by foreign donors ) has been allowed into Gaza for its power station , no food has been allowed in for the United Nations ' aid distribution centres on which most Gazans rely .
No journalists are being allowed into Gaza to cover the story .
The one crossing through which people can get into Gaza , if they have Israeli permission , is at the northern tip of the territory , at Erez .
It has a vast terminal building for security checks , but for days , journalists have not even been allowed further than the security barrier outside .
' Minimising movement '
This morning , we tried to get through .
Having handed in our passports and Israeli Government press cards , we waited by the front barrier , close to two Israeli army jeeps .
Over the hours that passed , we watched a group of Red Cross personnel get clearance to enter the terminal to go into Gaza .
Gaza facing fresh fuel shortages
The head of the United Nations relief mission in Gaza , John Ging , arrived at the gate too .
He was allowed to pass .
Earlier in the week , UN staff had been denied entry into Gaza .
But we were told we would not be allowed in today .
Coming the other way , past the armed guards , we counted 10 Palestinians , in small family groups .
They smiled as they loaded their luggage into the taxis that have been struggling for business here .
A French journalist came through as well .
" I have been stuck in Gaza for five days , " he told us , not wanting us to name him .
" Every time I called the manager of this place , he told me no journalists were being allowed through but I tried my luck this morning and they finally let me out .
It 's like they are trying to squeeze the journalists , I do n't know why . "
There have been severe restrictions at Israel 's border crossings with Gaza for some time , but they were tightened further in the summer of 2007 as a means of putting pressure on Hamas , which violently seized control of the territory .
Truce tensions Last Tuesday , more than four months into a ceasefire , Israeli troops entered the Gaza Strip .
Since then , seven Hamas militants have been killed in clashes and airstrikes .
The army says it was responding to a specific threat and that it did not consider that the truce had been broken .
The closures follow Israeli operations and Palestinian rocket strikes Palestinian militants said they regarded it as an " Israeli aggression " and responded by firing dozens of rockets and mortar shells towards Israeli border towns .
No Israelis have been injured , but the Ministry of Defence took the decision to close most of Gaza 's crossings in response .
The Ministry 's spokesman told us only humanitarian cases were being allowed in or out of Gaza .
When asked why journalists were being prevented from going through the terminal when diplomats and civilians were not , he said : " We want to minimise the movement of people through the crossing for the security of our staff there , if we allow journalists through , then many other foreigners will want to go in as well . "
The Foreign Press Association in Israel said the restrictions were a " serious violation of press freedom " .
" [ The Israeli authorities had ] offered no plausible explanation for the extended lockdown ... and current hostilities need not preclude movement of journalists , " it said .
Of course , the passage of journalists is far from the most serious problem .
The head of Gaza 's power plant says that one of the turbines there has already had to be shut down , reducing the amount of electricity being supplied .
He says that the plant will have to be closed completely overnight unless it receives fuel .
' Prison '
As a protest at the months long Israeli blockade , a boat carrying European politicians docked in Gaza over the weekend .
Former British cabinet minister Claire Short was among the passengers .
" This is brutal , deliberate collective punishment , " she told us on a mobile phone from southern Gaza .
" It is in breach of Geneva Conventions , and the United Kingdom and European Union are colluding in it with their silence .
Israel is trying to batter and beat a whole people just to crush Hamas . "
" Gaza 's a prison , " said Baroness Jenny Tonge , who had also arrived on the boat from Cyprus .
" We 've seen shortages of absolutely everything .
The schools do n't have paper , the hospitals do n't have medicines .
We 've just been shown some of the tunnels to Egypt which have had to be dug to get badly needed supplies , " she added .
At the outset of the ceasefire , Gazans hoped that the strict sanctions imposed on them would be eased .
A senior foreign diplomat in the region has expressed to the BBC his disappointment that the opportunity for " confidence building measures " has not been taken by Israel in the months since .

You might have noticed that my 2008 NFL picks have been incomprehensibly respectable .
After throwing you off the scent with a rocky 6 - 10 start in Week 1 , I finished .500 or better each of the next 10 weeks ( an 81 - 59 stretch ) as the " You suck , just stop making picks ! " e-mails slowed to a trickle .
Just know that it was n't a fluke .
There are four specific and undeniable reasons for my resurgence .
I am sharing one of them with you right now .
( Hold on , I 'll let you enjoy the anticipation for a couple of seconds . )
( Still milking it . )
( Just a little longer . )
( OK . )
For the first 11 weeks of the regular season , home - field advantage has not mattered like it once did .
I realized this during the Bears - Colts game in Week 1 , when Kyle Orton waltzed into Indy and ruined the grand opening of Lucas Oil Stadium , the latest state - of - the - art football venue that seems much more interested in looking cool and making money over , you know , actually helping its home team win games .
The place was so dead for four quarters that you could almost hear John Madden salivating over his postgame meal of fried turkey legs , blooming onions and Lipitor parmigiana .
You could have laid a baby down at midfield , and it would n't have woken up .

Following Chicago 's upset victory , after I had finished rejoicing that the Colts willingly gave away the trump card of a deafening Hoosier Dome , I remembered a conversation between me and my buddy Bug right before the season .
Bug and his crew have owned season tickets for the Patriots since 1993 .
Once upon a time , nobody loved attending NFL games more than them .
Bug woke up on Sundays at 7:45 a.m. no matter how hung over he was , paid the prostitute and asked her to leave ( OK , that 's not true ) , took a quick shower ( not true either ) , squeezed himself into his Willie McGinest jersey , packed his car with beer and food , picked up his pals , packed more beer and more food , and then they zoomed down Route 1 to Foxboro and snatched a choice parking spot right next to the stadium .
A massive , ambitious , artery - clogging tailgate commenced .
Bug 's friend Niko ( the Wolfgang Puck of tailgaters ) assumed command of the grill and sneered at everyone who got in his way .
Everyone else ate and drank , smoked cigarettes or cigars and discouraged their buddy Grover from starting potential fights for reasons like " That loser in the Jets jersey keeps eyeballing me " and " I just do n't like the way that guy with the earring looks -- he looks a little too pleased with himself , if you ask me . "
At 12:30 p.m. , they packed everything up and headed toward the field , where they sat on freezing - cold aluminum bleachers in a lovable cesspool called Foxboro Stadium and cheered their crummy team .
And you know what ?
They loved it .
They were part of something .
When Gillette Stadium opened eight months after New England 's first Super Bowl title , the boys reacted like Tom Hanks in " Cast Away " right after his rescue , when he 's wandering around an empty hotel room after the " Welcome Back ! " party , looking at the high - rise tray of fresh seafood and wondering what the hell just happened .
Suddenly , it was harder to get there and harder to park .
Many die - hards were nudged to the third level of the stadium , with their noise drifting toward the sky instead of the field .
The lower seats and suites were dominated by some die - hards and an inordinate amount of laid - back , well - connected fans who were n't exactly painting their faces before games .
The chasm between the " haves " and the " have - nots " was jarring .
I 've attended three Pats games in the Gillette Mausoleum and always felt like I had been transported into a David Lynch movie in which everything looked slightly the same , only it is n't even remotely the same .
Throw in the dirty secret that it is n't really fun to attend an NFL game in the 21st century -- the routine of " kickoff , TV timeout , three plays , punt , TV timeout , five plays , field goal , TV timeout , kickoff , TV timeout , someone gets hurt on first down , prolonged TV timeout , three more plays , touchdown , extra point , TV timeout , kickoff , TV timeout " gets old after about 25 minutes -- and by 2006 Bug 's friends were making pro-and - con lists for keeping their tickets .
So , why have n't they given them up yet ?
" The tailgates , " Bug says grimly .
" If we could take the tailgate and replicate the camaraderie in our backyard , we 'd do it . "
Yikes .
Even those tailgates became less enjoyable when the Patriots opened Patriot Place this season , a super - mall / mega - complex that bumped fans out of the main parking lot unless they paid an extortion fe — er , a premium fee .
Team Buggy now tailgates on the other side of Route 1 for $ 50 , crammed between a zillion other cars in a miasma of charcoal fumes .
It takes them 35 - 40 minutes to walk from this space and find their seats inside .
It takes them another 90 minutes to get home because common fans can't use the special access road for high rollers .
Suddenly , it 's an 11 - hour commitment -- and a relatively expensive one -- to hang out and support their favorite team in an increasingly somber stadium .
" We used to stand for every big down and every big drive , " Bug says wistfully .
" Now people yell at us to sit down .
The old stadium was a dump , but we felt like we were at a football game , you know ?
Now we 're at ... I do n't know .
The fans do n't affect the game anymore .
It 's really sad .
Grover calls it the wine - and - cheese crowd .
We 've become the fans we always made fun of . "
So , how did we get here ?
Like so many other Patriots fans who fretted about them possibly moving in the early '90s , I will always appreciate Robert Kraft for saving the franchise , hiring Bill Belichick , winning three Super Bowls and keeping the team competitive .
But he turned the experience of being a Patriots season - ticket holder into something of a Have / Have - Not dynamic , an ironic twist for a local businessman who originally curried favor because of his " I 've been a lifetime Pats fan and season - ticket holder just like you ! " mantra .
Once upon a time , the fans felt like Kraft was one of them .
He was a " have " who cared just as much about the " have - nots . "
Fairly or unfairly , some do n't believe that anymore .
I would put my buddy Bug and his friends in that group .
They feel disenfranchised to a degree .
Like Turtle and Drama if " Aquaman " hit big , then Vince told them they had to start sleeping in the guesthouse .
That brewing disenfranchisement keeps popping up at these home games .
You can not hear it , if that makes sense .
And not just in New England .
Thirteen teams have built SOTAS ( state - of - the - art stadiums ) since 1999 ; 14 if you include Daniel Snyder 's overhauling of FedEx Field in 2004 .
Each stadium follows a similar let 's - rake - in - the - cash blueprint .
The first section of seats hug the field .
At the top of those sections , the club seats start .
That 's followed by a phalanx of premium luxury suites .
More luxury suites dominate the second section .
And the majority of blue - collar fans are crammed into the upper decks .
Fundamentally , it 's a flawed way to cultivate a home - field advantage ; beyond the emotional compromises and festering resentment of the blue - collar fans , the newer stadiums do n't reverberate noise the same .
Look at Lambeau or Ralph Wilson Stadium -- just rows and rows of fans , one after the other , rising for something like 75 rows before you hit your first luxury box .
Watching the Browns - Bills game Monday night , I found myself enjoying the fans as much as the contest itself .
Now this was football !
Of course , Buffalo " needs " to build a new stadium to bank that suite money and " compete " with bigger teams .
That 's what owner Ralph Wilson says .
He snookered outsiders like me with that argument until I made a few Toronto jokes and Buffalo fans graciously educated me on what was really happening .
They want to purchase the team in a public trust and keep the stadium as is , like how the good people of Wisconsin own the Packers , but the NFL passed rules years ago preventing that from ever happening again .
Why ?
So its owners could sell their franchises for the highest dollar , and so they could bilk their fans for new stadiums without them saying , " Wait , why ca n't we just keep the old one ? "
It 's Economics 101 and one of the reasons that the fan / team dynamic can be so indefensibly one - sided and discouraging .
We care about them ; they do n't care about us .
In a perfect world , Wilson would sell the Bills to the locals and everyone would be happy .
In the real world , the Bills will probably move to Toronto some day and play in -- you guessed it ! -- a SOTAS that looks like every other SOTAS .
What does this have to do with gambling ?
In the words of Russell Hammond , everything .
After sitting through that Colts - Bears atrocity , I made the executive decision to discount home - field advantage until the weather turned .
Turned out to be a wise move .
Through 11 - plus weeks ( including Thursday night 's Pittsburgh cover ) , the 14 teams that built SOTAS since 1999 ( including Washington ) are 29 - 44 against the spread .
Yup , you read it correctly : 29 - 44 .
Week after week , those teams keep getting toppled at home or fail to cover big spreads , typified by three Week 10 games : New England losing in overtime to the Jets , the Colts winning but failing to cover an 8.5 - point spread against lowly Houston , and Dallas handling the Redskins in Washington .
Would you want Sage Rosenfels trying to cover eight points at the deafening Hoosier Dome ?
Could 30,000 Steelers fans have taken over a madhouse like RFK ?
Would Elway 's Broncos have ever stumbled to an 0 - 4 - 1 record against the spread at Mile High ?
Could the Titans ever have prevailed in Soldier Field in cold weather without running the ball ?
Would I have picked last Thursday 's game between evenly matched Jets and Pats teams by saying , " I 'd like us if we were playing on the road , but since we 're home , I 'm taking the Jets ? "
The NFL has been flipped on its wealthy behind .
GAMBLING TREND OF THE YEAR Sixteen 2008 home teams opened as double - digit favorites and only two have covered : The Giants ( Week 7 ) and Steelers ( Week 12 ) .
The Dallas - San Fran game takes place on Sunday .
WK 1 : Patriots ( - 16.5 ) Chiefs
WK 3 : Patriots ( - 12.5 ) Dolphins
WK 3 : Giants ( - 13.5 ) Bengals
WK 4 : Cowboys ( - 11.5 ) Redskins
WK 5 : Cowboys ( - 15.5 ) Bengals
WK 6 : Redskins ( - 13.5 ) Rams
WK 6 : Vikings ( - 13.5 ) Lions
WK 7 : Giants ( - 10.5 ) 49'ers
WK 7 : Buccaneers ( - 10.5 ) Seahawks
WK 8 : Jets ( - 12.5 ) Chiefs
WK 9 : Bears ( - 12.5 ) Lions
WK 10 : Chargers ( - 15.5 ) Chiefs
WK 11 : Dolphins ( - 10.5 ) Raiders
WK 11 : Panthers ( - 14.5 ) Lions
WK 12 : Steelers ( - 10 ) Bengals
WK 12 : Cowboys ( - 11 ) Niners
A reader named Matvei alerted me to a fascinating trend before Thursday 's game in Pittsburgh : Of 14 double - digit home favorites through 11 weeks , only ONE covered : The Giants in Week 7 ( see sidebar ) .
You could call it the ho - hum theory -- if you attend an NFL game that 's not so much fun in the first place , and you 're fully expecting your team to blow the other team out , how do you get excited for anything that happens in that game unless it 's a night game and everyone 's bombed ?
Win and you 're supposed to win .
Struggle and it's more annoying than anything .
Ho-hum .
And if you think the home team does n't get affected by that lack of energy , you 're crazy .
There are other reasons for the erosion of home - field advantage , of course .
The QB / coach headsets .
Charter planes .
Better grass and turf -- except for Pittsburgh 's field ( which is like playing on Chunky Soup ) .
Giant heaters for cold games , giant spray machines for humid games .
I 'd even add the Internet and video games here -- in the old days , players laid in their hotel room after curfew , flipped between three channels and listened to their roommate snore .
Now ?
They can keep themselves relatively entertained .
It 's not the worst thing in the world to play a road game anymore .
But back when you were flying coach to Chicago to play in 14 - degree weather at Soldier Field ?
Or on the rock - hard turf at Arrowhead Stadium ?
Bad times .
So how far away is the average NFL home game from turning into a neutral - site Super Bowl ?
Closer than you think .
The following home - field " advantages " work as long as the teams involved are legitimately solid ( and not mediocre , like we saw with the Bills on Monday night ) : Minnesota , Buffalo , Oakland , Green Bay , Kansas City and the Jets / Giants .
Of the SOTAS teams , Seattle and ( to a lesser extent ) Denver can make the field cameras shake for big moments .
But because of the prices , TV timeouts and cold weather -- not to mention the BlackBerry generation of people who get bored in three minutes -- home cooking does n't matter like it did .
And the numbers back this up .
Home teams versus spread ( 2008 ) : 66-89
SOTAS home teams versus spread : 29 - 44 .
SOTAS home teams versus spread as favorites : 19 - 34 .
Hmmmmmmmmm .
Could it just be a fluky season ?
Let 's look at the past six years of SOTAS teams at home against the spread :
2008 : WEEK 1 TO WEEK 11 Team Favorite Underdog Total Arizona 2 - 1 1-0 3 - 1 Chicago 1 - 2 1 - 1 2 - 3 Cleveland 0 - 2 2-1 2-3 Cincinnati 0 - 2 2 - 1 2 - 3 Denver 0 - 4 0-0 0 - 4 Detroit 0-0 0 - 4 0 - 4 Houston 1 - 3 0-0 1 - 3 Indianapolis 1 - 4 0-0 1 - 4 New England 2 - 4 0-0 2 - 4 Philadelphia 3 - 2 0-0 3 - 2 Pittsburgh 2 - 4 0-0 2 - 4 Seattle 1 - 2 0 - 2 1 - 4 Tennessee 3 - 1 1-0 4 - 1 Washington 1 - 3 0 - 1 1 - 4 TOTAL 19-34 10-10 29-44
2002 : 30 - 41 ( 13 - 26 as faves )
2003 : 51-33 ( 37 - 24 as faves )
2004 : 42-49 ( 28 - 32 as faves )
2005 : 47-48 ( 37 - 28 as faves )
2006 : 49 - 52 ( 27 - 41 as faves )
2007 : 55 - 42 ( 41 -35 as faves )
2008 : 29 - 44 ( 19 - 34 as faves )
Quick follow - up to those numbers :
Your typical NFL season goes one of two ways , either predictable or unpredictable .
Predictable seasons play out like the '03 or ' 07 seasons did , with a clear separation between high - end teams , middle - class teams and the lower class .
( For instance : In '03 , the Pats , Titans and Eagles finished 38 - 10 overall versus the spread and 16 - 7 at home versus the spread . )
Unpredictable seasons play out like ' 02 or ' 08 , when the number of high - end teams dwindles and the middle class swells with up - and - down teams .
We can usually determine by late September if we 're headed for an unpredictable season -- remember , I predicted goofiness in 2008 after three weeks -- and those are the times you HAVE to think , " Road teams !
Road teams ! " for gambling purposes .
At least for the first 11 - 12 weeks .
Taking it a step further , home teams are 53 games under .500 against the spread since 1999 ( 1134 -1187 ) .
Remember the days when you just filled out an office pool by saying , " I 'm taking all the home teams ? "
No more .
Look at what happened Thursday .
Once Cincy 's inept offense fell behind to a superb Pittsburgh defense in snowy conditions , normally the Bengals would have had as much of a chance as a second season of " Sports Soup " ... and yet , they came within a Troy Polamalu goal - line interception of covering that 10.5 - point spread .
When the weather chills over these last few weeks of the season , could the staggering success of the road teams get tempered a little ?
Maybe .
But it sure seems like we have entered a new era of NFL gambling , and with three more SOTAS teams arriving soon -- Dallas and the two New York teams -- half the league will be playing in stadiums that have absolutely nothing in common with Lambeau Field .
It 's a little depressing .
Potentially lucrative ... but depressing .
Home Teams vs Spread ( since 1999 ) 2008 : 66-89

As for Bug and his friends , they planned to give up their seats after this season until Niko talked everyone out of it .
After all , the man is in his grilling prime .
It would be like Leo DiCaprio giving up acting or Todd Palin giving up his snow machine .
You can't take the tongs out of Niko 's hands .
He has people to feed .
" Does n't matter , I 'm sure we 'll get our seats yanked within the next two seasons , " Bug predicts .
" Grover is going to flip out soon .
He 's like 25 more ' SIT DOWNS ' away from causing an international incident .
It 's not gonna end well .
He takes this stuff personally . "
And he should .
The bad news is that , with just a few exceptions , it 's now more entertaining to invite your friends over , tailgate in your backyard and watch your favorite team on TV .
You get the replays .
You get HD .
You have your own bathroom .
You 're saving money .
You can stand up if you want .
You do n't have a commute .
If you have the NFL package , you can flip around to other games during commercials .
What 's the downside ?
You got me .
I had 10 times more fun watching the Pats - Jets game at a New York City bar last week than I would have had at the actual game .
And the sad thing was , I knew that would be the case .
So that 's the bad news .
The good news is that we can keep profiting from home - field disadvantage during those first 11 - 12 weeks before Vegas finally catches on .
And they have n't .
At least not yet .
( Wait a second , why did I write about this again ? )

Many interested in organic food are , since Kosher Turkeys are required by Jewish law to be slaughtered in a particular fashion designed to be humane .
Sarah Palin’sTurkey video has just increased awareness of the issue this year !
They are also often organic by default , that is raised without pesticides , growth hormones , etc … .
and , of course , are considered exceptionally tasty .
I heard this story on NPR ’s Marketplace this morning ..” There ’s a shortage of kosher turkey and beef thanks to the closing of supplier Agriprocessors , which had provided much of the country ’s kosher meat … ” and immediately wondered how our Thanksgiving would turn out since , the friends with whom we hope to share the holiday meal swear by these birds .
Agriprocessors halted production earlier this week and then closed its doors .
The company that supplies an estimated 40 % of the country ’s kosher turkeys has found it self in well , if not the oven , in hot water !
Agriprocessors was the site of a May immigration raid in which 389 workers were arrested .
Plant managers later were charged with violating child labor laws , wage and hour regulations and safety rules .
.. the target of a massive federal immigration ( investigation ) in May … in recent weeks its troubles have multiplied , leading to a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing on Nov. 4 .
Several companies have filed lawsuits against Agriprocessors ( including ) First Bank .
The former Postville plant manager , Sholom Rubashkin , was arrested twice and is now being held in federal custody on multiple charges .
Rubashkin , the son of the company owner Aaron Rubashkin , stands accused of helping illegal employees procure fake work documents and orchestrating an accounting scheme that permitted the company to borrow more money than it had collateral to cover .
If convicted , Rubashkin faces more than 50 years in jail .
While manufacturers of both kosher and organic turkeys have rushed in to fill the production gap , but it ’s likely that in many households , it will be a vegetarian ( or at least not kosher )
Thanksgiving this year and not by choice !
BTW -
It seems Agriprocessors was n’t such a sterling name in humane slaughter anyway !

Detroit's Big
Three auto makers presented turnaround plans to Congress on Tuesday that indicate both General Motors Corp. and Chrysler LLC could collapse by the end of the month unless they get billions of dollars in emergency government loans .
As part of a renewed bid for a bailout , GM said it needs an immediate injection of $ 4 billion to stay afloat until the end of the year , a fact it had n't before disclosed .
In total , the company said it needs $ 18 billion in loans -- $ 6 billion more than it said it would need just two ...
To help communities across the US being impacted by wildfires , we 've issued $ 1 M in grants and were joined by Googlers donating to support relief efforts .
Join us if you 're able .
Given the recent positive reading for GDP , some are now doubting that we will even face a recession .
This of course is a misnomer and most average Americans realize that our country finds itself in a very tenuous situation .
It is very easy to brush off the current talk of economic malaise as simply another business cycle unwinding yet this time there are many fundamental circumstances that simply make this situation a very unique beast .
As baby boomers reach retirement age it could not have happened at a worse time .
The economy is on the brink of recession and we are going to face the largest entitlement program drain on our system ever .
Social Security was never devised as a retirement or pension program but a large portion of our elderly depend on this income .
There is a baby - boomer age - wave theory proposed by economist Harry Dent that views a peak in the US stock market at 2007 and 2009 .
His prediction is based on observations that consumer spending peaks at or near age 50 .
With many boomers starting to retire in the upcoming years the age - wave theory predicts a slow down in the economy .
Generally speaking there are 76 million people that were born between 1946 and 1964 .
With that said , 2011 will be the first year that the first baby boomers will hit the 65 year age mark and the beginning of a long - term trend that will become more reliant on entitlement programs .
This is happening just as the largest United States housing bubble is popping .
With residential housing prices peaking at nearly $ 24 trillion only to see about $ 5 trillion of that disappear in a few short years , the economy is facing constraints at the worst possible times .
We are also seeing consumer inflation pick up in gas , groceries , and healthcare at a time when many boomers are going to be stuck on a fixed income .
While prices go up , their monthly payment is fixed .
In this article , we are going to examine 10 very crucial areas in our economy that practically guarantee that for the next decade , we are going to see slow to negative growth in our economy .
We ’ll examine housing , entitlement programs , and income to try to arrive at a forecast for the next decade .
Factor 1 – New Homes Sold
Examine the above chart for a minute .
Never in our nation ’s history have we seen such an epic boom in new homes being sold .
For the past decade , much of our economic prosperity was intertwined with the fate of housing .
In fact , there have been recent estimates that housing related industries accounted for 30 to 40 percent of job growth since 2000 .
The peak was reached in the second half of 2005 .
At this time homes were flying off of the shelves like the latest hit album and financing was ample to fuel this flame .
Keep in mind the above chart is for new homes .
Thus we can assume that builders were keen to this information and started an epic housing construction boom to meet this new home demand .
Much of the creative financing including the $ 500 billion in currently outstanding option ARM mortgages helped fuel this run up .
This pace was simply unrealistic since the growth in population was not keeping up .
In fact , demographic trends would have pointed to an otherwise conclusion .
That is , many baby boomers now with empty nests would be selling their homes and downsizing and organically there would be a natural jump in housing inventory on the market .
Instead , we had a decade long boom in new home construction that will now contend with the onslaught of baby boomer homes that will hit the market in the next decade .
Factor 2 – New Housing Units Started
Given the above , builders were quick to catch onto this once in a lifetime trend .
Yet what you ’ll notice is that new home sales peaked in the second half of 2005 while new housing starts peaked in the summer of 2006 .
This lag of course was many builders came late to the game and over estimated the actual demand in the market .
What they failed to grasp was much if not most of the market was a Ponzi scheme based on pure speculation .
This was similar to 1920s Florida real estate except this engulfed numerous metropolitan areas across the nation .
States like California , Florida , Nevada , and Arizona are feeling the brunt of this correction .
The new housing starts and new homes that have been built assure us that we will have plenty of housing for the next decade .
Even though many are now pointing to the decline in housing construction as a sign that we will move inventory off the market in the next few years , they fail to examine the baby - boomer age - wave theory and fail to realize that many boomers will be selling their homes in the upcoming years which will once again push inventory up .
The birth rate has also massively declined since the time of the baby boomers .
Take a look at the below chart :
* Source : Profutures.com
So the trend is unmistakably for smaller families which of course means that many people do not need bigger places which is ironic given the average size of a home has increased over this time not for necessity , but for other reasons .
Factor 3 – Construction Spending
It would logically follow that construction spending has now declined as well .
Construction spending peaked with new housing starts in 2006 .
Since then , it has been steadily declining .
Given the nature of construction , much of the unemployment in this industry has hurt many other areas .
These are generally high paying jobs but also include much of the shadow economy of employment .
Recent data on remittances to Latin America show a major decrease in money being sent back home that nearly parallels the peak in construction spending and contraction .
In addition , trucks are a big part of the industry .
Construction bodes well for this industry but it has been hit with a one - two punch .
First , the industry has contracted but then high fuel costs have also hurt the recreational truck buyer .
That is , those that buy not because they need a truck but because they want a truck .
Construction employs a large number of people and this pull back is only going to fuel even higher unemployment which we are already seeing .
The idea being postulated that we ’ll see this pick up soon is somewhat unfounded .
Just as we start clearing the current glut of new housing , which is 2 to 4 years away , we should be seeing a natural organic selling of baby boomer homes .
Not to be macabre but James Love of BoomerDeathCounter.com states that a Baby Boomer will die every 49.5 seconds in the USA during the year 2008 .
This number will increase simply because of aging and the natural life process and this will add more inventory to the overall housing market .
In this same vein , most boomers will also start relying much heavier on an already over burdened healthcare system .
These reasons practically ensure that we will see a decade long contraction in construction as it pertains to residential housing .
Factor 4 – Household Debt and Liabilities
It is hard to believe that there is nearly $ 14 trillion in household debt in the United States .
This trumps our nationwide GDP .
As I discussed in a previous article as to why the United States will not see a second half recovery , this amount of debt is putting a pinch on the bottom line of many households .
A large amount of this debt , approximately $ 11 trillion is mortgage debt .
As the price of housing continues to fall , the amount of debt does not move .
That is the challenge that we are facing .
Much of the foreclosures that we are seeing are a vicious way economically speaking of reconciling the balance sheet of America .
That is , lenders are not going to willfully modify a long by $ 200,000 but if a owner cannot make the payment due to the larger economic forces , the lender will get the property back and will have to contend in the open market which will clear the house out at a much lower price .
The amount of debt is simply staggering .
Debt in itself is not bad but when you have this much on the balance sheets of American households , what has occurred is many have spent for today with the next decade of earnings .
In a consumerist economy where nearly 70 percent of our economy is based on spending , people are going to be forced to pay off debt instead of consuming .
And this can be seen in the following chart .
Factor 5 – Household debt as a Percent of Disposable Income
Since 1980 even with ups and downs in our economy , the percent of a household ’s disposal income toward debt payments has steadily increased .
Money that can be used to go out and have a nice dinner is now diverted to paying the monthly minimum on your American Express card .
This is a serious problem .
This can only go on for so long and given that the household debt has gone from $ 5 trillion in the mid 90s to the current $ 14 trillion is simply amazing .
Yet much of this debt increase was due to the epic housing bubble .
Never in the history of this country has household debt surpassed GDP until now .
You may be asking , if approximately $ 11 of the $ 14 trillion is mortgage debt , what is the rest ?
The bulk of the remaining $ 3 trillion is consumer debt .
In fact , credit card companies and auto lenders are now starting to see a large increase in defaults and late payments on these items .
Why ?
Well the economy is grinding to a halt and if you lose your job or have a pay cut , all of a sudden more of your disposable income is going to service current debt that has n’t changed .
It becomes a vicious cycle and that is why the debt trap is such a bad precedent to set .
Factor 6 – U.S. Banking Facing Major Issues
I remember seeing the above chart at the FDIC a few months ago .
It had one bank .
Yet I had to wonder , why in the world would you put a drop down menu if you only have one bank on the list ?
Clearly the FDIC knew that the United States banking system was going to be facing long term problems .
With the failure of Indymac bank the FDIC initially estimated that the cost would be from $ 4 to $ 8 billion .
There initial insurance fund is at $ 53 billion .
Now , recent revisions tell us that the cost will be more like $ 8.9 billion .
With this one bank failure , the FDIC will eat through 16.7 percent of their fund .
They have come out with a recent report that revised the March 2008 number of troubled banks from 90 to 117 , an increase of 30 percent in one quarter .
In fact , FDIC Chairwoman Shelia Bair is now mentioning that the FDIC may need to seek assistance from the U.S. Treasury ( aka the bank of you and me ) .
Given that U.S. banks have over $ 6 trillion in deposits you would think that $ 53 billion ( much of it eaten up at Indymac ) would do nothing to cover even a slight amount of the overall funds .
If as we are expecting systemic problems to arise , we can expect this number to balloon .
Yet why is this going to put the breaks on the economy for the next decade ?
Banks are now becoming more prudent since much of the money being lent is now their own which puts them on the hook .
The “ give money to anyone with a pulse model ” is finished .
I used to get about 20 pieces of mail a week for new credit cards .
Now it has dwindled down to about 4 or 5 a week .
Now that banks actually have to verify income and ability to pay , it turns out that many Americans do not qualify for loans .
Many areas now require 10 , 15 , or even 20 percent down to purchase a home .
One reader sent me an article from Florida where in some heavily hit areas , lenders are requiring 40 percent down .
In California where the median home price is $ 318,000 , that means buyers would need to put down $ 31,800 or $ 63,600 plus closing costs .
As we are quickly finding out , not many people have this amount of money .
Even with a 5 percent down payment we have seen what it will do to the market .
No money down was a large part of the market .
Given the problems in U.S. banks many are tightening lending at a time when most people actually need money .
Banks do not stay in business doling out charity .
As the adage goes , a good borrower is someone who does not need the money .
Unfortunately , many people now need the money yet banks are afraid to play with their own money .
Factor 7 – Income Inequality
* Source : Wikipedia
Even given our decade long housing and credit boom where homeownership soared to record highs , the inequality in wealth in our country has never been so pronounced .
People have just learned a quick lesson that debt does not equal wealth .
Having items that make you appear wealthy does not mean that you actually have a healthy balance sheet .
Look at the above chart .
Only 17.8 percent of United States households make over $ 100,000 per yea r.
We ’ve already highlighted before in a detailed budget that $ 100,000 does not get you that far anymore especially in areas like California .
Some politicians would have you believe that $ 5 million is the threshold for middle class yet only 0.12 percent of American households make over $ 1.6 million a year .
In fact , I have the actual number for that .
In the United States only 146,000 households have incomes over $ 1,500,000 while there are only 11,000 households that make more than $ 5,500,000 .
82.2 percent of all households make under $ 100,000 per year .
Can any politician point this out ?
Maybe they are betting that you will acquiesce on the tired old line of “ no new taxes ” instead of looking at who would get the real tax break .
I think given how divergent this is , let us look at both McCain ’s and Obama ’s tax proposals :
* Source : Washington Post
Things are rarely so clear cut .
When you have many of the hedge fund managers and heads of financial institutions making $ 10 million a year providing products that have harmed our economy , there is something seriously wrong .
Financial innovation which once sounded like the new panacea now has echoes of snake oil in the streets of America .
Just like during the Great Depression , Wall Street and bankers were seen as the new captains of industry only to be paraded on Capitol Hill in the 1930s to be reviled for the damage they had caused the country .
Things have gotten so out of control and this Ponzi scheme is now coming to a painful close .
Keep in mind that if we are to punish this decade long bubble and implement regulations and enforce these regulations , we are going to have to pay the piper .
This means living within our means .
Can Americans do that for a decade to retool their economy for the long future ?
Sadly when we hear gimmicks about fixing bucket issues it goes to tell us that many Americans only care about the one step that is in front of them instead of the larger and more broader picture .
It is time to dig into the data and see the facts for what they are .
Even Arnold is quickly realizing that “ no new taxes ” is a tired line and has backed off his no tax promise .
Do you really think those at the top of the criminal crony ladder really deserve major tax breaks ?
Factor 8 – Government Spending
* Source : Perotcharts.com
Now we need to come full circle and look at the entitlement programs .
For years we have talked about fixing Social Security and Medicare but have n’t done a single thing about it .
Guess what ?
That day has now come .
Whether people want to deal with this or not we now have no choice .
We spent $ 1.45 trillion in mandatory spending items including Social Security , Medicare , and Medicaid in 2007 .
53 % of the $ 2.73 trillion Federal Budget is based on these fixed items .
Another troubling line item is the $ 237 billion in interest that we pay each year on debt .
The U.S. is simply reflecting the poor management of budgets like U.S. households .
Discretionary spending is somewhat of a misleading label .
Many items such as the military and defense really are not discretionary since these will not go anywhere .
When it comes down to it , a small amount is actually debatable here .
The rest is never even touched by politicians since it is like a third rail in politics .
For many of the younger generations , we look at these items and wonder if we will ever even see one Social Security check even though we are putting in more and more money into this fund .
Take a look at this chart :
You can see how quickly payroll tax rates have increased over the last few decades .
Yet you need to remember that there is currently a cap on this at $ 102,000 .
Remember the inequality charts above ?
What this means is those with the highest incomes pay the least in percentage terms into this fund .
82.2 percent of the population pay every nickel on the above rates into this fund .
Now to be upfront I do n’t think simply lifting the cap is going to solve the stunning amount we have to confront .
There has to be a shift in how this will work .
When Social Security was created , the life expectancy of people was n’t as high as it is now .
It was never crafted as a retirement or pension system yet many Americans now rely on Social Security as a primary source of their retirement income .
We are going to have to make some hard choices here .
What will that be ?
Either raise the tax rate or let many folks go without these funds .
That is the flipside of the political equation .
Many “ no tax ” folks are quick to say do n’t ever raise taxes yet fail to follow their logical conclusion .
Then what then of the 76 million baby boomers that will be retiring in the next few years ?
That of course is the harder question .
In addition , bad fiscal policy by government causing consumer inflation is a hidden tax but many people do n’t understand how inflation even works so this is a good way to tax the public .
There is a great book by Christopher Buckley called Boomsday that examines this exact issue .
It is a humorous look at this impending entitlement debacle and explores the possibility of generational politics emerging as a major issue .
Currently everyone is for Social Security .
But how is that going to play out in the future for younger generations if they realize they wo n’t see any of that money and become a bigger and more powerful voting bloc ?
This is going to be a major issue and we need to get ready for this .
And what of the 401 ( k ) idea ?
Well given how the stock market is currently going , you may be happy with a 5 percent return on a guaranteed investment .
If the above trends hold , how horrible of a crosswind to see both a sinking stock market when baby boomers will start drawing on their accounts .
Factor 9 – The Explosion of Entitlement Programs
* Source : Perotcharts.com
Here is how this oncoming tsunami looks .
Currently we spend about 8 percent on Social Security , Medicare , and Medicaid .
This is going to explode and if we hit a severe recession , these estimates are going to go higher since we ’ll have a lower GDP .
In addition , the $ 9.6 trillion in national debt ( which will now go over $ 10 trillion with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the FDIC ) has a large portion of entitlement IOUs given by the United States government .
That is , the money that people currently pay into the tax system are being used right now for other government spending including current entitlement outflows .
Remember that lock box talk ?
Now you know why it was so important but people rather make fun of things they do n’t understand .
Now it is time to pay up .
Keep in mind that these tax receipts are viewed by the government as an income stream only second to the actual income taxes paid .
At this rate , there is going to be some serious negotiations for the next decade and either way , this is going to put a clamp on our economic growth for the next decade .
Factor 10 – Booming Foreclosures
The immediate problems of course are with the housing market .
Long viewed as the most stable of all investments , housing is no longer a solid rock .
This long held belief is being shattered and if housing is n’t safe then what is ?
Stocks ?
No. Commodities ?
Not always .
So where do people put their money ?
Aside from all the bottom callers trying to look for the proverbial housing bottom we are really very far away from seeing a bottom in housing .
They are like a dog chasing its own tail .
Once we reach the bottom then what ?
That is the ultimate reality check .
Do they somehow think that we are going to hit the bottom and rebound like this past bubble we just had ?
No chance .
If anything , we ’ll be back to seeing housing as a boring and dry investment as it should be seen .
If you look at the above chart monthly foreclosure filings are still at record levels .
Before we can acknowledge a bottom we first have to define what a bottom is .
If we are looking at prices , nationwide it looks like we will hit a bottom in the second half of 2009 or early 2010 .
If we look at states like California , we wo n’t see a bottom in price until May of 2011 .
If we are defining a bottom as a low in sales , we may be reaching that point yet most people associate a bottom with price so given that definition , we are not even close to a bottom as highlighted by the above foreclosure trend .
Keep in mind , that in California nearly half of all sales were foreclosures .
These sales by definition are problematic and are thus pushing prices lower .
Nationwide foreclosures are making up a large portion of all sales .
This will keep prices low .
Until the above chart starts declining , then we can realistically talk about a bottom .
Until then , it is merely mincing data with sales numbers and minor bumps in the larger trend .
By looking at multiple facets of the economy it is very likely that we will see a L shape recession like Japan did in the 1990s which it is still battling with .
I know many people will argue that we are very different yet given the housing bubble , our boomer population , and credit contraction I just do n’t see how we avoid this .
People partied this decade on the back of the next decade ’s prosperity .
It is now going to be time to pay the check .

Egg Cream Controversy
If you were not brought up in New York or have n't had the pleasure of visiting , you 've probably never heard of an Egg Cream .
Egg creams were a beverage that was often served in candy stores and restaurants alike in the early 1900s .
A New York Egg Cream is basically chocolate syrup , Whole Milk and Carbonated water ( seltzer ) , mixed together in a cup to make a delicious chocolaty beverage .
Contrary to the name , an egg cream actually does NOT contain any egg .
Chocolate Syrup ( Kosher U - Bet is preferred ) Whole MilkCarbonated water ( Seltzer is preferred ) Bon appetite !
Before anybody comes in and gets angry saying that I 've placed the ingredients in the wrong order , I 'd like to mention that there are many ways to prepare an egg cream .
Some people put the chocolate syrup in first , some put it in last .
Ultimately it comes down to how you like it , if you like to put the chocolate syrup in after you 've mixed the milk and Seltzer , go for it , it is your drink after all !

More about KenDoku
KenDoku puzzles by Conceptis , also known as Square Wisdon , CanCan and MinuPlu , are based on the same rules of KenKen™ , a successful educational puzzle invented by Tetsuya Miyamoto in Japan as an instruction - free brain - training method .
KenDoku rules are very simple and require a little basic math coupled with a lot of interesting logic .
Each Conceptis KenDoku puzzle consists of a grid containing blocks surrounded by bold lines .
The object is to fill all empty squares so that the numbers 1 to N ( where N is the number of rows or columns in the grid ) appear exactly once in each row and column .
In addition , the numbers in each block produce the result shown in the top - left corner of the block according to the math operation appearing on the top of the grid .

A school district in Dallas has been caught supplying fake Social Security numbers to employees .
And it ’s been going on for years .
The Dallas News wo n’t come out and say it , but it ’s blindingly obvious this school district was cooking up fake Social Security numbers for illegal alien teachers ( referred to in the report as “ foreign educators ” ) .
Which means they committed at least three crimes : ID fraud , hiring illegal aliens , and felonious aiding / abetting illegal aliens .
And then they tried to cover it up .
Your tax dollars at work :
Years after being advised by a state agency to stop , the Dallas Independent School District continued to provide foreign citizens with fake Social Security numbers to get them on the payroll quickly .
Also Online Some of the numbers were real Social Security numbers already assigned to people elsewhere .
And in some cases , the state ’s educator certification office unknowingly used the bogus numbers to run criminal background checks on the new hires , most of whom were brought in to teach bilingual classes .
The practice was described in an internal report issued in September by the district ’s investigative office , which looked into the matter after receiving a tip .
The report said the Texas Education Agency learned of the fake numbers in 2004 and told DISD then that the practice “ was illegal . ”
It ’s unclear how long DISD had been issuing the phony numbers , and district officials did n’t know Thursday how many had been given out .
But the investigative report and interviews with DISD employees indicate the practice went on for several years before it was discontinued this past summer .
DISD human resources chief Kim Olson , who came to the district in 2007 , said that she learned about the false numbers this past summer around the time the district ’s investigative unit was looking into them and that she put a stop to the practice .
“ There ’s no way we should be doing that kind of stuff , ” Ms. Olson said .
“ Even if your intention is good to help employees get paid , you ca n’t use inappropriate procedures to do that . ”
Wait , it gets worse :
Also , when investigators reviewed a sampling of personnel files , they learned that the fake numbers were entered on Department of Homeland Security and IRS forms .
The forms are not transmitted outside the district but are made available to the appropriate federal agency upon request .
In July , the district discovered that 26 of the false numbers were in use after matching DISD employee Social Security numbers with the Social Security Administration database .
The numbers were already being used in Pennsylvania .
DISD officials did not know Thursday whether the practice had caused problems for anyone holding the legitimate numbers .
The district ’s investigative unit , called the Office of Professional Responsibility , began looking into the fake numbers after the Texas Education Agency ’s division of educator investigations advised the unit in July that it had discovered the district issuing false numbers in 2004 .
ORDER IT NOW
That year , the TEA division became aware of the practice when DISD faxed copies of about 100 new Social Security Administration cards for foreign citizens – most of whom had been assigned district - issued numbers – and asked TEA to replace the old numbers , according to the investigative report .
The state office told DISD at the time that it ’s illegal to make up Social Security numbers and pass them off as legitimate , the report says .
Wait , it gets even worse :
The investigative report also found that the district has n’t been turning in “ new hire ” forms to the Texas attorney general ’s office , which uses the information to find parents who have n’t paid child support .
Failure to provide the forms to the attorney general can result in a $ 25 fine for each employee .
The district does n’t know yet whether it will have to pay any fines .
Ms. Olson said new processes have been put in place to address problems noted in the report , including making crosschecks with the Social Security Administration .
“ You ca n’t just arbitrarily issue Social Security numbers , ” she said .
“ Even if your intention is good , it ’s not legal . ”
So , will there be any consequences ?
Or will it be non-enforcement business as usual ?
I wonder what healing power is ascribed to culture in urban renewal strategies .
Since the 80s , the value of musea , events and shiny waterfront developments for urban regeneration grew to the attention of policymakers .
Even in deprived neighbourhoods , culture is increasingly seen as an important tool for improvement .
But is culture actually this wonder medicine ?
I plea for a wide interpretation of culture as a signifier and a value maker .
Bush : ' I was unprepared for war ' John Byrne

Five years after he declared victory in Iraq on the US aircraft carrier USS Lincoln , President George W. Bush says he was " unprepared " for a war in Iraq that has gone on to claim thousands of American lives and tens of thousands of Iraqis .
" I wish the intelligence had been different , I guess , " Bush tells ABC 's Charlie Gibson in an interview to be broadcast tonight , and said he did n't know if he'd have gone to war if he did n't think there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq .
" That is a do - over that I can't do , " Bush said .
He said incorrect intelligence about Saddam Hussein 's arsenal was the " biggest regret of all the presidency . "
" I think I was unprepared for war , " Bush remarked .
" In other words , I did n't campaign and say , ' Please vote for me , I 'll be able to handle an attack , ' " he said .
" In other words , I did n't anticipate war .
Presidents -- one of the things about the modern presidency is that the unexpected will happen . "
But also he tried to spread the blame -- and his credulity -- for bad intelligence on others .
" A lot of people put their reputations on the line and said the weapons of mass destruction is a reason to remove Saddam Hussein , " Bush said .
" It was n't just people in my administration .
A lot of members in Congress , prior to my arrival in Washington , D.C. , during the debate on Iraq , a lot of leaders of nations around the world were all looking at the same intelligence . "
" I listened to a lot of voices , but ultimately , I listened to this voice : I 'm not going to let your son die in vain , " he said .
" I believe we can win .
I 'm going to do what it takes to win in Iraq . "
In the interview , Bush also defended his administration 's response to a now paralyzing economic crisis spurned by the failure of the US credit markets .
" When you have the Secretary of the Treasury and the Chairman of the Fed say , ' If we do n't act boldly , we could be in a depression greater than the Great Depression , ' that 's an ' uh - oh ' moment , " he said .

Communities living around some of Coca - Cola 's bottling plants in India are experiencing severe water shortages - due to Coca - Cola 's extraction of water from the groundwater resource as well as pollution by the company 's plants .
Located primarily in rural areas , the hardest hit have been farmers who have seen significant declines in crop production as well as women who now have to walk longer to access potable water .

A study funded by Coca - Cola - which the campaign forced it to agree to - confirmed that Coca - Cola is a significant contributor to the water crises and one of its key recommendations is that Coca - Cola shut down its bottling plant - in Kala Dera in the state of Rajasthan - where the community has been campaigning against Coca - Cola .

The study - The study - a damning indictment of Coca - Cola 's water management practices in India - concluded that the Coca - Cola company had sited its bottling plants in India from strictly a " business continuity " perspective that has not taken the wider context into perspective .
It also warned Coca - Cola of worsening water conditions around its bottling plants , found an alarming increase in pollution as one got closer to Coca - Cola bottling plants and faulted the company on pollution prevention measures , among others .
In typical fashion , the Coca - Cola company has chosen to ignore the findings of the study - which it paid for and even participated in - and is now insisting that shutting down the Kala Dera plant and leaving is not an option because the responsible thing to do is to stay and solve the problem because they are " problem solvers " !

But surely a company cannot just choose to ignore the fiercest battleground it faces when it comes to measuring Coca - Cola 's sustainability ?

Allowing Coca - Cola to get away with such a disingenuous plan significantly weakens the core aims of corporate social responsibility as well as objective reporting and makes CSR nothing more than an extension of public relations for companies .

CHICAGO ( MarketWatch ) --
The percentage of U.S. mortgage holders who were behind in their payments soared to a record 6.99 % of loans outstanding in the third quarter , the Mortgage Bankers Association said Friday , and the number of mortgages somewhere in the foreclosure process was also at a new high .
But the number of mortgages on which foreclosure proceedings was started actually fell slightly during the third quarter compared with the second quarter , according to the Mortgage Bankers Association 's quarterly delinquency survey .
That does n't necessarily indicate a slowdown in foreclosures , said Jay Brinkmann , MBA 's chief economist .
" An initial look at the number of foreclosure starts would seem to indicate at least a leveling off of foreclosures .
These numbers , however , are being influenced by several factors including various moratoria on foreclosure filings and by mortgage companies holding loans in the 90 - plus - day bucket during the modification and workout process , " said Jay Brinkmann , MBA 's chief economist , in a news release .
" Evidence of this can be seen in the large increase in loans 90 days or more past due but not yet in foreclosure .
This rate jumped by 45 basis points , the highest increase in this category ever recorded in the MBA survey and far above the average 4 basis point jump we would expect to see . "
Mortgages entering the foreclosure process fell to 1.07 % , from 1.08 % in the second quarter but were up from 0.78 % a year ago .
The delinquency rate for mortgage loans on one - to four - unit properties was a seasonally adjusted 6.99 % of all loans outstanding at the end of the third quarter .
That 's up from 6.41 % at the end of the second quarter and 5.59 % a year ago , according to the survey .
" There are some good reasons , in a sense , why that number might go up , " Brinkmann said , during a phone interview .
As mortgage lenders and servicers try and work with borrowers , constructing repayment plans and modifying loan terms , those borrowers will remain classified as delinquent until they can show they can make payments on time , he said .
The percentage of loans somewhere in the foreclosure process also rose in the third quarter to 2.97 % , up from 2.75 % in the second quarter and 1.69 % a year ago .
Subprime mortgages continued to perform poorly , with more than 19.5 % of those loans seriously delinquent in the third quarter , meaning homeowners were more than 30 days past due on payments .
Both prime and subprime adjustable - rate mortgages continue to have the highest share of foreclosures , Brinkmann said .
And California and Florida continue to drive national numbers on foreclosure starts : " California and Florida have about 54 % and 41 % of the prime and subprime ARM foreclosure starts respectively , " he said .
The MBA 's national delinquency survey covers about 45 million loans on one - to four - unit residential properties , representing between 80 % and 85 % of all " first - lien " residential mortgage loans outstanding in the United States .
The loans surveyed were reported by about 120 lenders , including mortgage bankers , commercial banks and thrifts .
Read about how mortgage rates tumbled this week .
Effect of job losses
In past quarters , main reasons that California and Florida had some of the highest foreclosure starts had to do with a combination of too many houses built , speculation and weak underwriting , he said .
Those states still have the highest shares of foreclosure starts , but now people are also falling behind because of job losses .
" Economic fundamentals are now deteriorating in California and Florida .
Over the past year , Florida led the nation in job losses at 156,200 , with California losing 101,300 , as compared with Michigan job losses at 71,200 and Ohio at 17,300 , " he said in the release .
The job losses make it more difficult to anticipate when foreclosure problems will ease .
Foreclosure starts are on pace to end up at 2.2 million for 2008 , Brinkmann said .
Without a recession next year , his expectation was that the numbers would start to fall .
More than half a million jobs lost in U.S. in November as layoffs mount .
" We can pretty much throw that out the window right now , " he said , during a call with reporters .
He expects to see a growing delinquency problem among prime mortgages in the quarters ahead , driven by job losses .
In the third quarter , the delinquency rate for mortgages 30 days or less past due was still below levels seen in 2002 , Brinkmann said .
But loans that are in that delinquency category are more likely to end in foreclosure these days , he said .
Government lays plans to aid troubled mortgage holders .
In the past , 12 % to 15 % of mortgages that were 30 days or less overdue in one quarter ended up in foreclosure the next quarter , he said .
In 2007 and 2008 , 30 % of those loans ended up in foreclosure the following quarter .
And in California , 75 % of loans overdue by a month or less are ending up in foreclosure the next quarter , Brinkmann said .

Mimicking synapses like this one is crucial to the effort IBM has announced it will lead a US government - funded collaboration to make electronic circuits that mimic brains .
Part of a field called " cognitive computing " , the research will bring together neurobiologists , computer and materials scientists and psychologists .
As a first step in its research the project has been granted $ 4.9 m ( £ 3.27 m ) from US defence agency Darpa .
The resulting technology could be used for large - scale data analysis , decision making or even image recognition .
" The mind has an amazing ability to integrate ambiguous information across the senses , and it can effortlessly create the categories of time , space , object , and interrelationship from the sensory data , " says Dharmendra Modha , the IBM scientist who is heading the collaboration .
" There are no computers that can even remotely approach the remarkable feats the mind performs , " he said .
" The key idea of cognitive computing is to engineer mind - like intelligent machines by reverse engineering the structure , dynamics , function and behaviour of the brain . "
' Perfect storm ' IBM will join five US universities in an ambitious effort to integrate what is known from real biological systems with the results of supercomputer simulations of neurons .
The team will then aim to produce for the first time an electronic system that behaves as the simulations do .
The longer - term goal is to create a system with the level of complexity of a cat 's brain .
Dr Modha says that the time is right for such a cross - disciplinary project because three disparate pursuits are coming together in what he calls a " perfect storm " .
We are going not just for a homerun , but for a homerun with the bases loaded
Dharmendra Modha
IBM Almaden Research Center Neuroscientists working with simple animals have learned much about the inner workings of neurons and the synapses that connect them , resulting in " wiring diagrams " for simple brains .
Supercomputing , in turn , can simulate brains up to the complexity of small mammals , using the knowledge from the biological research .
Modha led a team that last year used the BlueGene supercomputer to simulate a mouse 's brain , comprising 55 m neurons and some half a trillion synapses .
" But the real challenge is then to manifest what will be learned from future simulations into real electronic devices - nanotechnology , " Dr Modha said .
Technology has only recently reached a stage in which structures can be produced that match the density of neurons and synapses from real brains - around 10 billion in each square centimetre .
Networking Researchers have been using bits of computer code called neural networks that seek to represent connections of neurons .
They can be programmed to solve a particular problem - behaviour that appears to be the same as learning .
But this approach is fundamentally different .
" The issue with neural networks and artificial intelligence is that they seek to engineer limited cognitive functionalities one at a time .
They start with an objective and devise an algorithm to achieve it , " Dr Modha says .
The ultimate goal is to create a circuit with the complexity of a cat 's brain " We are attempting a 180 degree shift in perspective : seeking an algorithm first , problems second .
We are investigating core micro- and macro-circuits of the brain that can be used for a wide variety of functionalities . "
The problem is not in the organisation of existing neuron - like circuitry , however ; the adaptability of brains lies in their ability to tune synapses , the connections between the neurons .
Synaptic connections form , break , and are strengthened or weakened depending on the signals that pass through them .
Making a nano - scale material that can fit that description is one of the major goals of the project .
" The brain is much less a neural network than a synaptic network , " Modha says .
First thought
The fundamental shift toward putting the problem - solving before the problem makes the potential applications for such devices practically limitless .
Free from the constraints of explicitly programmed function , computers could gather together disparate information , weigh it based on experience , form memory independently and arguably begin to solve problems in a way that has so far been the preserve of what we call " thinking " .
" It 's an interesting effort , and modelling computers after the human brain is promising , " says Christian Keysers , director of the neuroimaging centre at University Medical Centre Groningen .
However , he warns that the funding so far is likely to be inadequate for such an large - scale project .
That the effort requires the expertise of such a variety of disciplines means that the project is unprecedented in its scope , and Dr Modha admits that the goals are more than ambitious .
" We are going not just for a homerun , but for a homerun with the bases loaded , " he says .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Are you ready yet ?
Mike Huckabee comes out on top in a poll of support for potential 2012 GOP presidential hopefuls .
Barack Obama is more than six weeks away from assuming the presidency , and the next Iowa caucuses are more than three years away , but a national poll out Friday suggests that former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin top the list of potential 2012 Republican presidential hopefuls .
Huckabee leads in the CNN / Opinion Research Corp. poll released Friday .
The survey is an early measure of possible support for the next GOP presidential nomination .
Thirty - four percent of Republicans and independents who lean toward the GOP said they are very likely to support the former Arkansas governor as the Republican nominee in 2012 .
Huckabee surprised many by winning this year 's Republican Iowa caucuses and seven other contests before dropping out of the race in March and backing Sen. John McCain .
Palin , McCain 's running mate , is 2 percentage points behind Huckabee , at 32 percent .
Considering the survey 's sampling error of plus or minus 4.5 percentage points , Palin and Huckabee are basically tied .
" It might come as a surprise to some that Palin does better than Huckabee among GOP men , but that Huckabee beats Palin among Republican women .
Palin 's strength is also concentrated among older Republicans , but Huckabee may have a slight edge among conservative Republicans , " said Keating Holland , CNN 's polling director .
Among voters who consider themselves born again or evangelicals , Huckabee holds a 9 - percentage point lead over Palin , with the Alaska governor ahead by 7 points among those not in that group .
Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney is in third place in the poll , with 28 percent of those questioned saying they are very likely to support him as the GOP nominee in 2012 .
Romney gave up his bid for the White House in February and backed McCain .
Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich is 1 percentage point behind Romney , at 27 percent .
In 2007 , Gingrich flirted with making a stab at the Republican nomination but decided against jumping into the race .
Twenty - three percent said they would be very likely to support former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani if he decides to run again .
Giuliani was the front - runner in many polls in late 2007 before performing poorly in the early primaries and caucuses .
He dropped out of the race for the White House in January and immediately backed McCain .
Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal , who 's considered a rising star in the GOP , grabs the backing of 19 percent , with Florida Gov. Charlie Crist at 7 percent .
" Jindal and Crist are relative unknowns .
The fact that they get much less support than the others is likely a function of name recognition rather than a true measure of their potential base of support , " Holland said .

An unseemly mother - daughter dispute threatens to smudge the glittering public face of L'Oréal , the world 's most successful cosmetics company .
The mental capacity of L'Oréal 's chief shareholder , Liliane Bettencourt , 86 , to manage her € 23bn ( £ 20.5 bn ) fortune has been challenged by her only child , Françoise .
Mme Bettencourt , one of the world 's wealthiest women and a renowned philanthropist , is reported to have funded life insurance policies worth nearly € 1bn which benefit a jet - set photographer , artist and author whom she has befriended .
Her daughter has brought a legal action which suggests that her mother 's great age makes her vulnerable to " abuse " .
The complaint was first made almost a year ago but details have just emerged in the French press .
An investigative website , Bakchich .info , reported that police had discreetly interviewed both Mme Bettencourt and the man who is said to have become virtually her adopted son , François - Marie Banier .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
M. Banier , 61 , is a playwright , novelist and above all a photographer and friend of the glitterati , ranging from Johnny Depp to Princess Caroline of Monaco .
He is said to be the sole beneficiary of several life insurance policies , endowed over many years by Mme Bettencourt .
According to Bakchich.info and the Journal du Dimanche , Mme Bettencourt confirmed the existence of the insurance policies to investigators but said that she knew exactly what she was doing and could " sponsor " whoever she liked .
To borrow L'Oréal 's own catch - phrase , she was giving part of her fortune to M. Banier " because he was worth it " .
Mme Bettencourt declined to undergo medical examinations to prove her mental capacity .
The row is part of a long - simmering dispute between mother and daughter , who have hardly spoken to each other for several years .
Both Mme Bettencourt and Françoise Bettencourt Meyers are board members of L'Oréal which had a global turnover of € 17.1bn in 2007 and employs 63,000 people worldwide .
Other board members include Mme Bettencourt Meyers 's husband , Jean - Pierre Meyers , and the Cheshire - born businessman Lindsay Owen - Jones , who built L'Oréal to its present pinnacle in his 18 years as chief executive of the company before he stood aside in 2006 .
L'Oréal was founded by Mme Bettencourt 's father , Eugene Schueller .
She married the French politician André Bettencourt , a friend of the late President François Mitterrand , in 1950 .
She still owns 27.5 per cent of the stock of L'Oréal and has used her fortune , among other things , to fund the Bettencourt - Schueller foundation which invests in medical research , helping the illiterate and housing for the homeless .
A confidante of her daughter told the Journal du Dimanche yesterday that Mme Bettencourt Meyers had brought the legal action because she feared that her mother was no longer in control of her actions .
" She is not looking for any money , but is afraid , quite simply , that her mother , at her advanced age , is about to fritter away her fortune , " the confidante said .
Mme Bettencourt 's lawyer , François Goguel , told the newspaper : " She is travelling in the United States at present and is very well .
She does not wish to make any comment on what is a private affair . "
The lawyer said , however , that the € 1bn figure had been " exaggerated " and that the gifts to M. Banier , in the form of insurance policies , had been made freely over a number of years .
Mme Bettencourt lives in a large house in Neuilly - sur - Seine , the wealthy suburb just west of the Paris city boundary which was for many years the political fiefdom of President Nicolas Sarkozy .
The public prosecutor for Nanterre , who covers the Neuilly area , must now decide whether to launch a full investigation or let the matter drop .
Mme Bettencourt is known to have one of the finest private collections of art in France .
She has donated several works , including paintings by Pablo Picasso , to M. Banier but they are not covered by her daughter 's legal action .
M. Banier has written several novels and plays but is best known as a photographer with privileged access to the famous .
His friends include the actress Isabelle Adjani and the fashion designer Pierre Cardin .
He is also a close friend of the celebrity acting couple Vanessa Paradis and Johnny Depp , whose relationship began at M. Banier 's home in the south of France .
The Iraqi journalist who threw his shoes at George Bush was tortured into writing a letter of apology , his brother said today .
Muntazer al - Zaidi was wrestled to the ground after throwing his shoes during a news conference held by the US president and the Iraqi prime minister , Nouri al - Maliki , on 14 December .
The investigating judge in the case said last week that Zaidi , who will stand trial on 31 December , was beaten around the face and eyes .
Zaidi's brother , Uday , said the journalist suffered worse injuries , including a missing tooth and cigarette burns to his ears , and would sue .
Zaidi is in custody and faces up to two years in jail for insulting a foreign leader .
Maliki 's office said last week that Zaidi had written a letter of apology and asked him to recommend a pardon .
Uday al - Zaidi said his brother told him the letter was written against his will because he was subjected to torture , including being doused with cold water while naked .
" He told me that he has no regret because of what he did and that he would do it again , " Uday said .
" The thing that makes you cry and laugh at the same time is that when the prime minister said that my brother was not tortured and will not be tortured , he was under severe torture by security authorities . "
Maliki said Zaidi admitted in the letter that a terrorist had induced him to throw the shoes .
" He revealed … that a person provoked him to commit this act and that person is known to us for slitting throats , " Maliki said , according to the prime minister 's website .
The alleged instigator was not named .
Maliki said his government remained " committed to protecting the journalist in performing his professional duty , " and guaranteed him the right to practise his profession " on condition that he does not violate the dignity of others " .
Neither Bush nor Maliki have sought charges , but investigating judge Dhia al - Kinani said last week he did not have the legal option to drop the case .
Footage of Zaidi attacking Bush was repeatedly broadcast worldwide and he has become a symbol for opponents of the US - led invasion and occupation of Iraq .
Thousands of Iraqis have rallied to demand his release .
Some sought a cart of groceries the week before Thanksgiving , others sought a way to keep from losing their homes in the new year .
By the thousands , a diverse group of Southern Californians converged on two events Saturday aimed at helping families in hard economic times .
The problems , and the aid offered , were vastly different .
But both reflected the worries and needs of many .
In Montebello , nearly 5,000 turned out for a food giveaway , a number that stunned organizers who had tried to keep it a low - key event , targeting publicity to several churches and schools .
But word of mouth proved stronger than a few fliers , and crowds inundated Montebello Park .
A diverse mix of people stood in a six - hour - long line -- families from middle - and working - class communities , including Pico Rivera , Montebello , Norwalk and Whittier .
No one left empty - handed , though .
In Van Nuys , about 2,000 homeowners attended a workshop promoted as Home Preservation Day .
But this was not about how to lay tile or install plumbing .
A bank had mailed notices to homeowners in trouble with their mortgages , and Saturday offered them a chance to rework the terms of their loans .
Bankers had hoped 100 would turn out , and planned for 200 .
Loan counselors had time to meet with a fraction of homeowners and some were turned away .

Filling empty cupboards
Just a few paychecks ago , Betty Gillis , 44 , was volunteering at a food pantry , handing out food to the needy .
Saturday , she found herself on the receiving end of a food giveaway .
Last month , the Whittier pharmacy technician was juggling two jobs to support her disabled husband , mother - in - law , and college student daughter .
But her full - time employer cut her hours because there were too few customers .
Her bosses also required her to work on weekends , forcing her to quit her second job -- and the money ran out .
So on Saturday , Gillis stood in a block - long line at Montebello Park and accepted a cart - full of groceries for Thanksgiving week .

“ My daughter asked me the other day , ‘ Are we so poor that we have to stand in line for food ? ’
And I said , ‘ Yeah , ’ ” Gillis said .
The scene in Montebello reflected the crisis confronting local food banks struggling to keep up with demand that has surged more than 40 % since last year , according to Los Angeles Regional Food Bank .
New to food lines are middle - class families -- including some that until recently earned $ 70,000 a year .
“ We ’re used to seeing low - income people and seniors on a fixed income coming in .
Now we ’re seeing more and more middle - class people coming in -- people who just lost their job , are trying to pay their mortgage , or tapping into their 401 ( k ) because of the huge financial losses , ” said Darren Hoffman , a spokesman for the regional food bank .
Saturday ’s event was sponsored by Heart of Compassion , a Montebello faith - based nonprofit food bank .
Organizers were surprised by the large turnout -- more than double than expected -- because they did not heavily advertise the event .

But before dawn , a line of 500 had already gathered in the park for the 10 a.m. opening .
By noon , thousands of people stood in the warm November sun .
Those in line hardly spoke , gazing into the park or holding on to restless children .
When they approached the makeshift food bank -- a collection of blue - and - white tents in a parking lot -- each family took a metal shopping cart and steered it down a line of volunteers , receiving bags of oranges , cantaloupes , celery , cereal , tomatoes , pumpkin pies , yogurt , bottles of cooking oil and loaves of bread , among other items .
Natalie Gomez , 25 , held her purse and a single balloon for her 4 - year - old daughter , who fidgeted during the five - hour wait .
The Montebello woman said her husband ’s employer , a printing company , cut his hours because of decreasing business .
“ It ’s my first time here at an event like this , ” said Gomez in a quiet , tired voice .

Martha Garcia , 36 , of Pico Rivera , said she needed the donated food to offer some semblance of a feast this week .
Garcia said most of her money is being saved for her 10 - month - old son , who needs surgery .
The donated food will help , she said .
But there were no turkeys available .
“ On Thanksgiving , ” she said , “ I wo n’t have enough food . ”
Looking for breaks

Homeowners in Van Nuys received food for thought Saturday for their most nail - biting problem : making the monthly mortgage payment .
In a move designed to help troubled homeowners , IndyMac Federal Bank , the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and Los Angeles Neighborhood Housing Service sent letters to 4,000 local residents inviting them to attend a so - called Home Preservation Day .
The FDIC , which took over troubled IndyMac in July , launched the loan modification program in August .
The program ’s goal is to reduce monthly mortgage costs to a maximum of 38 % of the borrower ’s pretax income .
IndyMac officials calculate that can save the typical borrower $ 380 a month .
Saturday ’s event drew thousands -- husbands and wives and children -- and was so large that organizers began the workshop an hour early and continued it longer than planned .
Still , about half of those who showed up were turned away and advised they would be contacted later by phone .

Inside a large room at the San Fernando Valley municipal center , homeowners huddled with counselors , talking in hushed tones about private family finances .
Making a stressful situation worse , those waiting outside filled out long forms and voiced frustration over the complexities of modifying a home loan .
Only about a third of the 300 customers who were able to meet face - to - face with counselors were offered a loan modification .
To the dismay of many , property owners discovered that they have to be behind at least two months with their mortgage and facing foreclosure before they can restructure their home loan .
David Kimes , 74 , of North Hollywood , was among those who made the cut .
He is a general contractor whose work has shriveled 92 % this year because of the economy .
“ I have an adjustable rate mortgage coming due in 2012 .
I want to stay in my house until I die , ” he said .
“ They told me they ’d see what they could do . ”
Advertisement
But some of those not yet behind in their payments complained that bankers need to do more to prevent looming loan defaults and home foreclosures .
“ Why do you want to screw up the people who are making their payments and trying to avoid foreclosure ? ” demanded Constantine Metallinos , a 59 - year - old real estate broker from Agua Dulce .
“ You are forcing us into default before you ’ll help us .
People who are good citizens get penalized . ”
IndyMac spokesman Evan Wagner was sympathetic .
But he said his Pasadena - based thrift is limited in its flexibility to rework loans .
“ We ’re stuck enforcing existing contractual agreements ” with outside institutions that own about 93 % of IndyMac ’s loans , Wagner said .
“ The program is evolving .
We ’re helping people today who we could n’t help a month ago , ” he said .
But loan modifications are “ not about a better deal .
. . .
There ’s no principal reduction . ”
Advertisement
Those who qualify can have their loan interest rate lowered or the terms of the loan changed to stretch payments out 40 years instead of 30 .
Evans said a second Home Preservation Day is planned for Dec. 2 in Riverside .
He said the hundreds who walked away without any sort of loan modification offer Saturday should call IndyMac and try again .
Northridge resident Michael Sharp might want to take that advice after being told he and his wife , Susan , did not qualify .
Sharp , a 48 - year - old carpenter , owes $ 620,000 on the home the couple bought four years ago for $ 565,000 .
The monthly mortgage of $ 4,000 will jump in two years when an adjustable rate kicks in .
Advertisement
His wife is employed as a communications technician , but his work is drying up , Sharp said .
“ It would be foolish to say I ’m not afraid , ” he said .
Added his wife : “ In two or three months it will be a disaster .
Right now we ’re holding on , but the future does n’t look like it ’s going to be any better than it is right now . ”

 Ive Been Where You Are Now ...
My name is Darwin
My whole life I had been short ...
A Few Years ago I was a paltry 5  3 ... ( that s 160 cm for you European folk ! )
Today I stand at 5  10  ... and its NO MISTAKE !
How did it happen ?
 It All Starts With A Very Strange Story ...
I want to share with you a very unusual story that you might find it a little hard to believe , but this genuinely happened to me ...
It s about how I met a very peculiar man ... who would reveal to me EXACTLY what I had been searching for ... a definitive solution to my height problems .
What he showed me would end up working like crazy ...
I would then go on to develop a system that would help literally HUNDREDS of thousands of people all over the world ...
But more on that later !
This is EXACTLY how it happened ...
When I first moved to America ( Im from Vietnam ) , I used to rent from a small apartment in L.A .
Not flash by any means ... but the one thing I liked about it - was the fact that it had a small gym on the ground floor ...
At the time , I was feeling very insecure and defeated about my height ... more than ever ...
I had tried everything ... literally -- grow taller programs , supplements , HGH boosters , pills , insoles , herbs , potions ....
I used ALL supplements , tried all different kinds of height - gain programs  ... and products ...
Nothing seemed to work for me .
Someone had told me that weight - lifting could help me strengthen my bones which would in - turn help me grow taller ... ( someone had also told me the opposite but Ill tell you the truth later on ! )
I wanted to build muscle anyways so ...
 I Thought Id Give It A Shot ...
It was quite late -- 10 pm ... no one in sight .
I decided to start with the High Pulley ( basically where you pull up stacked weights )
Because of my reach , being short ...
I was having trouble getting to the actual Lat Bar to pull the weights up ... every time I had finished my reps , I would have to wriggle on to my knees , just to grab the Lat bar again ...
The third time I wriggled up to grab the Lat Bat ... I heard something ...
 A Knock On The Door ...
I turned to the left and saw through the window of the door ...
 Looks like you re having some trouble there boy !  the strange man exclaimed ...
 Go on , open up . 
I got up from the seat ... feeling a little unsafe ...
I let him in and hoped to God he wasnt going to knock me over the back of the head ...
He was an older man -had a short grey beard ... dark , weathered skin ... quite tall for a Vietnamese man ( he was definitely Vietnamese , his accent gave it away ) .
 I used to be short like you he said ...
 You need to do the Height Stuff ! 
I didnt say anything ... still a little flustered by the whole situation .
 The  Height Stuff 
 You gotta do the Height Stuff  he repeated , expecting me to ask what he was talking about ...
 What s the Height Stuff ? 
I said -- relaxing a little ... he didnt seem as threatening as I had first thought .
 It s good stuff .
Itll make you shoot up ! he said raising his left arm as high as he could above my head .
I was quite intrigued .
What was this  Height Stuff  ... I thought to myself .
 Ill show you ! he pointed towards the door .
 But where are we going ?  I asked .
 Follow me  ... he walked with purpose out the door ...
I realized he wasnt wearing any shoes .
 Back To His Apartment ...
His place was the same as mine ... small , poorly lit , peeling paint on the walls ...
He reached for something from his bookshelf and pulled out a bunch of seemingly old papers tied up with strings ...
 This must be the Height Stuff ?  I motioned towards the bunch .
 Yes !  he replied enthusiastically  You need to follow exactly these instructions ...
 And that s it ? 
I said ...  I just need to follow the instructions and I grow taller ...?
He nodded .
But held is hand up ...
 I havent showed you the most important part !
 The Secret  Height - Boosting  Cocktail ! 
5 minutes later he had whisked up something quite remarkable ...
Some sort of concoction ...
I took note on each of the ingredients he had used ...
 All you do is drink THIS everyday ... he said as if it were some sort of miracle drug .
He gave it to me ... it had a peculiar taste .
We talked until the wee hours of the morning , and I got to know him ... he was a veteran ... who actually fought in the Vietnam war !
His name was Phillip Ngyuen .
He told me of a story of why he spent years himself trying to grow taller ... just so he could be allowed to join an elite group of fighters during the war .
He told me how -- after much trial and error ... he had finally found a way to grow tall very fast ...
 Remarkably ...
He Had Grown
6 Inches In His Adult Years
With His Method ...
I was absolutely fascinated .
How on earth did he manage to gain so many inches in his adult years ...
I had always been told by doctors that even a single inch of height after puberty was impossible !
I asked him many questions .
It was nearly sunrise ...
I told him we would speak soon and I headed home to get a couple of hours sleep before work ...
It was a very strange night indeed ... but something in my gut told me I might have finally found something that would solve all of my height problems ...
 A Startling Discovery ! 
Like I said before ...
I was absolutely fascinated with the idea that Phillip had gained a whopping 6 inches in adulthood , which is thought to be impossible by many ...
I wanted to do some actual research and see if there was any scientific proof that would confirm what Phillip had told me ...
To my surprise ...
EVERY .
SINGLE .
INGREDIENT .
... Phillip had used in his height - boosting  cocktail had something incredibly remarkable in common ...
Each one of them contained very concentrated amounts of certain amino acids ...
Amino acids that when combined ... would produce a MASSIVE increase in the level of ONE specific hormone ...
* HGH * - The Miracle Hormone
Let me tell you ...
If You Dont Know Anything About THIS Hormone ...
You Are Missing Out On The BIGGEST SECRET To Growing Taller ...
And Doing It VERY RAPIDLY !
It ALL begins here ...
So what is HGH ?
HGH is short for  Human Growth Hormone  ...
THIS specific hormone has an ENORMOUS effect on the growing process of your bones ...
In other words ...
YOUR HEIGHT .
If you can harness the power behind increasing your HGH levels ... you can grow taller ... and you can do it faster than anything you would have imagined .
 Had I Stumbled Across The Ultimate Height Gain Solution ? 
It wasnt just the secret height - boosting  cocktail ... it seemed that each of the steps he had taught me had ...
UNDENIABLE SCIENTIFIC
PROOF !
They would all contribute dramatically in the way of GROWING TALLER !
And now with the scientific proof to back at what Phillip had taught me ...
I had NO excuses and nothing to lose .
I would try his method .
 My Amazing Results ! 
And so I did exactly what he said , following his instructions to the letter ...
What happened ?
As if it were magic ... I grew ... at an astounding rate :
 3 Inches In LESS Than A Month ! 
It was an incredible feeling ...
To have finally found something that would ACTUALLY work !
I was ecstatic ...
Phillip saw my results ... and wasnt surprised ...
OBVIOUSLY he knew it worked !
I decided I needed to share this with more people ...
But I wanted to make this method even MORE effective ...
 Creating My Own Height - Gain System ...
Using the principles behind Phillips method ...
I wanted to create my own Height - Gain system that would eventually be MUCH MORE effective than Phillips method !
This took a lot longer than I thought it would ...
I spent TWO PAINSTAKING YEARS of my life ...
Researching ...
Interviewing experts ...
Testing , Experimenting and Developing different exercises and ....
Creating new diets that would focus on increasing height !
I would stay home on weekends ...
Ignore invitations to parties ... not sleep as much as I wanted too ... and spend ridiculous amounts of money on everything I needed to develop this new system ...
But I loved every minute of it !
... I knew it would all be worth it !
Introducing ...

We live in a complicated and complex world where information , as well as misinformation , spreads at the speed of light .
It has become almost impossible to find objective information let alone a credible news source .
The amount of misinformation is exponential for subjects like politics considering the dumbest people are generally the most opinionated , loud and dogmatic which is referred to in most circles as the Dunning - Kruger effect .
For example , just think back to college and all your dumbshit friends who became Poly - Sci majors , almost overnight developing a superiority complex .
Collectively , we now have hundreds of thousands of said dumbshit college friends mass e-mailing , blogging and sometimes even managing to make it on television .
Minor note to my friends and family :
When you mass e-mail me some racist diatribe that says “ verified on Snopes ” and I then proceed to go onto Snopes to find that the opposite is in fact the truth , you will officially be filed into my “ Probably a little ‘ Syndromey ’ / from West Virginia ” folder .
How does one manage to become informed while knee deep in the clusterfuck known as contemporary media ?
How can an intellectual form an educated opinion , let alone a run -of - the - mill citizen , and still be confident that it ’s based on sound facts ?
Well , that ’s where the new “ Golden Rule ” comes into play .
No matter how complicated , it will never fail .
The New Golden Rule : Whatever George Bush does , thinks or wants , the exact opposite is correct .
And just because he ’s not president anymore , does n’t mean he ca n’t be used as an advisor to the public .
Just walk on over to his house in Texas , where he ’ll most likely be hammered because ‘ Fuck it right ?
I ca n’t do any better than President , ’ and ask him anything you ’re confused about .
“ Hey George what ’s up ?
Mind if I ask you a question ? ”
“ Shoot , go for it !
Hey , you wanna cold one ?
“ It ’s nine in the morning G - dubs .
I ’ll pass .
Anyways , what do you think about the current Israel - Palestine crisis going on right now ? ”
“ Well , I stand 100 % behind the action of Israel .
Considering Israel and I understand each other so well , they have my unquestionable and blind support ”
And there you have it .
Just think to yourself “ If Bush were in charge of Israel , what would he do ? ” and the truth will prevail .
In this instance , Bush would have done the exact same thing as Israel , so it ’s a mathematical proof that Israel is in the wrong .
Math is never wrong .
And to get the correct foreign policy , ask yourself “ What is absolute last thing Bush would do ? ” and you ’ll undoubtedly get the right answer like say , I do n’t know , not standing idly by while thousands of innocent civilians die ( on either side ) .
If you need further proof about the authenticity of this rule , there is no better place to look than the past .
Iraq ?
Wrong .
Deregulating the financial sector ?
Wrong .
Decreasing taxes while increasing spending ?
Wrong .
Not giving a rat ’s ass about Darfur or for that matter the whole continent of Africa ?
Wrong .
Living anywhere in Texas besides Austin ?
Wrong !
So , if you ’re in a pinch and need a political or moral compass , just remember the Golden Rule : “ What Would George Walker Bush Do ( WWGWBD or WWWD for short ) ? ” and you ’ll never be lead astray if you do the exact opposite .
Unless it ’s about partying .
Then do EXACTLY what he ’d do .
You know Bush is still down for a little booger sugar now and then .
Redford : Bush plan to drill around national parks ' criminal ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Tuesday November 25 , 2008
Print This Email This Among George W. Bush 's parting gifts to the American people have been several actions that appear as direct assaults on the environment , meant to be impossible for the Obama administration to reverse .
One such last - minute assault noted by MSNBC's Rachel Maddow is that " the Bush administration has decided to open up vast swaths of wilderness in eastern Utah for oil and gas extraction -- right next to the pristine natural beauty of places like Arches National Park . "
" On Election Day , " Maddow explained , " the Bureau of Land Management proposed leasing almost 360,000 acres of land to oil and gas speculators -- bypassing the National Park Service to do it .
And the thing about defiling nature to drill is that once it 's done , it 's done .
You do n't get pristine back . "
" Do you think they 'll get away with it ? "
Maddow asked actor and environmentalist Robert Redford .
" Bush 's environmental policies have been a disaster , " Redford replied .
" Whether it 's going to work or not is going to depend on whether the public wakes up to what 's really going on . "
" Whenever they could n't get a bill passed legitimately , they would go behind our backs , " Redford continued .
" When you stop and think about thirty years of hard work to get certain protections passed into law ... he 's tried in his eight years to undo just about every one of those laws .
...
It 's pretty cynical -- and in my opinion , it 's criminal . "
As an example of the cynicism he sees , Redford pointed to " the fact that they would do that on Election Day when everybody was distracted by the election , and set a date for December the 19th , and the sister agency ... was n't even told about it . "
" They went behind their backs so they could jam it through , " Redford concluded .
" So obviously , there 's a plan as Bush goes out . "
In response to Maddow 's questions about what can still be done , Redford was short on specifics , but he did affirm , " We could stop this .
... I think the American people will stop it -- and can stop it -- but they 're going to have to act fast . "

I ’m something of an artist , I do n’t do anything fancy , mostly just pencil and ink sketches .
However , this gives me an appreciation for art , though most of what I have hanging in my house is related to either gaming or comics .
Here is one piece of gaming artwork that I would definitely have hanging up .
The Tetris Mirror is my favorite kind of art , one that is not only appeasing to the eye , but is also useful .
The mirror consists of thirteen interlocking pieces that you can arrange in any fashion that you like .
Now if only there was some information regarding pricing and availability .

LONDON ( Reuters ) - Gadget makers showed off their green credentials at a technology show in London on Friday to try to tempt consumers worried about soaring fuel bills , climate change and the financial crisis .
The Wattson , a device which monitors the exact amount of electricity used in your house .
It displays the amount of watts used and the cost on a portable box with a digital screen .
REUTERS /DIY Kyoto / Handout
Amid the usual array of power - hungry televisions , stereos and computers , a handful of companies promoted high tech products designed to cut energy consumption .
London - based firm DIY Kyoto has come up with the Wattson , a wireless device that lets families monitor exactly how much power they are using at home .
It measures electricity consumption and displays the amount of power and how much it costs on a sleek portable box with a digital screen .
The device , which costs 100 pounds , glows red when households use more power than normal or blue when they are being energy efficient .
“ The whole idea is to save money and to save the environment , ” Jason Goldman , of DIY Kyoto , told Reuters at the Stuff Live ! show .
“ You find people try to get the reading down as low as possible . ”
British gadget Web site www.firebox.com displayed a Chinese - built electric scooter that it has converted for sale on the British market .
Called the Ego Street Scoota , it has a 30 to 40 - mile range and a top speed of 30 mph .
It costs eight pence to charge the bike using the mains electricity supply .
Parked next to it was a more powerful scooter from U.S. firm Vectrix .
Its Maxi-Scooter has a top speed of 62 mph and a range of 68 miles at 25 mph .
Its latest model has a built - in music player and a system that sends music wirelessly to your helmet .
While nearly all the gadgets on display rely on electricity or batteries , a range of portable chargers from U.S. company Solio uses solar power .
Its device can convert one hour of sunshine into an hour of playback on an iPod or 25 minutes of talk time on a mobile .
The gadget has three blades which fan out to catch sunlight which it then stores in an internal battery for up to a year .
Wearing its heart on its sleeve , one energy - efficient laptop came with a shell made of bamboo instead of the usual plastic or metal in an attempt to reinforce its eco-friendly aspirations .
Taiwanese computer maker Asustek said it used bamboo because it is strong , grows back quickly and is biodegradable .
One blogger quipped : “ Do n’t let your panda near it . ”

I spent the last weekend at the Phoenix Appleseed Shoot in Arizona with a number of fellow shooters .
I came with my wife , five children and my other best friend in tow .
We resembled the Beverly Hillbillies pulling into the campground in my F350 crew cab truck and trailer that should require harbor navigation skills ( notice that I do n’t advocate licensure ) on Friday night the day before the shoot .
We were exhausted but excited after the four - hour trip from southern Arizona .
Almost three - dozen shooters showed up for the training which is a fairly respectable turn - out .
What is an Appleseed Shoot ?
Fred , the proprietor of Fred ’s M14 Stocks and famous for long freedom polemics ( in a print size old people ca n’t read ) in Shotgun News , started and built the program .
The Revolutionary War Veterans Association is an umbrella organization that was created to bridge the gap between the Founding of the nation and the present day through educational outreach .
It started as a venture to bring history alive and revive the principles that animated our divorce from George III ( the other George ) from whence was born the Appleseed Project whose modest goal is to create one million new Riflemen in America .
To wit :
" The Appleseed Program is designed to take you from being a simple rifle owner to being a true rifleman .
All throughout American history , the rifleman has been defined as a marksman capable of hitting a man-sized target from 500 yards away — no ifs , ands or buts about it .
This 500 - yard range is traditionally known as “ the rifleman ’s quarter - mile ” ; a rifleman can hit just about any target he can see .
This skill was particularly evident in the birth of our country , and was the difference in winning the Revolutionary War . "
Imagine a country that has a significant number in the population who can outshoot the standing army or any government muscle for that matter .
Evidenced by the strategic standstill the insurgents have visited on the global military hyper - power with merely rifles and IEDs ( Improvised Explosive Device ) , world events should certainly give ambitious tyrants pause .
In Afghanistan , some of the rifles employed were designed and issued in the 19th century .
Yamamoto claimed that " [ y ] ou can not invade America .
There is a rifle behind every blade of grass . "
Speaking of the Swiss nod to the importance of the rifleman , Stephen Halbrook opines in a previous interview on LRC :
" Shortly before World War I , the German Kaiser was the guest of the Swiss government to observe military maneuvers .
The Kaiser asked a Swiss militiaman : “ You are 500,000 and you shoot well , but if we attack with 1,000,000 men what will you do ? ”
The soldier replied : “ We will shoot twice and go home . ”
While this may be apocryphal , it certainly speaks to the spirit that brought the Redcoats to their knees during their bloody slogs in the First American Revolution .
You would be hard - pressed to find a better contemporary example of the " rifleman deterrence " phenomenon than " Target : Switzerland " by Halbrook .
While the two - day soire we attended was primarily a shooting event , Appleseed intersperses fascinating narratives during the shooting day about the events of April 19th , 1775 that sparked the First American Revolution ( the second , of course , being the War of Northern Aggression 1861 — 65 ) to free the colonials from British tyranny .
The historical narratives provide a fascinating bridge between why guns and freedom are so intimately bound together .
This not my first Appleseed , I have been to one other when I lived in Idaho , but this was the first one where I brought the entire family .
The tuition was seventy FRNs for the weekend for me .
My wife and ALL of my children were free due to a special promotion to get the family on the firing line by the RWVA .
I have children ranging in age from 11 — 20 and varying levels of weapon and rifle expertise .
My wife even managed to outshoot me in the Quick and Dirty Army Qualification Test and I consider myself a fairly able rifleman .
My children did equally well and soaked up the outstanding training offered .
There is no paid staff for the shooting events , which occur nationwide .
The four volunteers who ran this particular event were omni-competent , knowledgeable about the rifle craft and patient with the most trying circumstances .
Think about that : four volunteers , two of whom drove from New Mexico , show up for two days of grueling training that consumed almost every daylight hour at the range to improve the shooting skills and historical knowledge of complete strangers .
They pay for their own expenses for the most part .
This should tickle the antennae of any freedom advocate .
This is spontaneous order of the highest magnitude
The RWVA and Appleseed program are ostensibly apolitical but the self - selection of attendees certainly betrayed a pattern : the most Ron Paul regalia you would see outside of a meet - up and a crusty skepticism of government power from a variety of perspectives .
One of the participants , Luca , a tall and delightfully accented Italian immigrant to America , waxed rather poetically about the promise of America , our historical amnesia and the necessity to reorder freedom by reviving our roots as a revolutionary project .
The other folks came from every walk of life from businessman to biker to housewives .
The Shoot Boss was AZGromit and the three assistant trainers were AZRedhawk44 , TaosGlock and BlueFeather ( the Appleseed instructors use their forum handles at the shoot ) .
They deserve public recognition as an example of the volunteer spirit and more importantly , the contribution to waking up the sleeping giant in America .
The Appleseed Project has struck a match .
It has become an integral part of our homeschool curriculum now .
The Best of William Buppert
HONG KONG , China ( CNN ) --
So what 's your list of top 10 mobile applications of 2008 ?
Does it include Twitterberry , Facebook , MySpace , BioWallet , Locale ?
Or do you favor Super Monkey Ball , Koi Pond , iSteam , iBeer or iFart ?
Google 's Android operating system may lack the sleek body of Apple 's iPhone , but it 's catching up .
If any one of your preferred applications was among the latter five , chances are you have an iPhone or iPod Touch -- applications developed for Apple 's mobile platform only work on Apple 's mobile devices .
And so far , most of Apple 's best - selling apps are familiar brands , social networking , games or novelty .
Yet thanks to Apple 's proprietary , vertical and exclusive way of doing business -- making the iPhone highly desirable and its accompanying App Store highly accessible -- the general public demand for mobile applications of all kinds is finally taking off .
" As soon as the iPhone SDK ( Software Development Kit ) was first released [ in July 2008 ] , " says John Lema , co-founder of ScrollMotion , " we realized that this was going to be a great opportunity for consumers and content providers , and we dedicated our efforts to developing platforms for iPhone and similar devices . "
In particular , ScrollMotion 's upcoming Iceberg Reader , the first application to partner with several major publishers of copyrighted books , promises to make full use of the iPhone / iPod Touch as a fully functional e-book reading device .
" Apple has built an incredible SDK for the iPhone / iPod Touch , " adds Kayvon Beykpour , co-founder of Terriblyclever Design , whose iStanford app provides a living guide and working tool for Stanford students .
( The free application was downloaded more times than there are individuals registered on the California Bay Area campus . )
" It 's not just a recent development , it 's the product of years of work that went into the Cocoa platform back from the NextStep days .
That platform , combined with the equally important distribution platform , make the iPhone / App - Store a killer combo for developers , " said Kayvon .
Apple may hold the winning hand for now , but ever since Google 's open - source operating system was announced in November 2007 , Android has been gradually creeping out of the shadows to challenge Apple 's dominance of the mobile applications market .
" Mobile devices are essentially small computers that have the capability to do so much , yet carriers have purposefully disabled them for corporate profit , " says Phandroid founder and evangelist Rob Jackson .
" The ' walled garden ' comes in the form of proprietary operating systems . "
" Android , on the other hand , is about enabling users , knocking the walled garden down .
Google 's philosophy , in everything , seems to be : Provide the best and most extensive service you possibly can and people will love it ... and then monetize it .
" Android is carrier - independent .
Android is manufacturer - independent .
And the more people that have Android , the more powerful it becomes , " he said .
Applications want to be free
Even if Apple is where the money is , it is no coincidence that unlocking ( opening to another mobile phone carrier ) and jail breaking ( opening to other platforms ) the iPhone is so popular -- because applications want to be free .
Shazam , a pioneer in live music identification via mobile phone , released both its iPhone and Android versions shortly following the launch of each platform 's applications store .
On Android , each Shazam - tagged song is seamlessly linked to the Amazon MP3 Store as well as the artist 's MySpace page .
Loopt , another application that adds the dimension of physical location to social networking , is a favorite of Scott Webster , editor of AndroidGuys .
" Location - based apps that run in the background will help separate Android from other operating systems , " he says .
" It 's simple to find out where your friends are at any given moment and see what they are up to .
You can let the app run in the background of your G1 ( or other Android device ) and constantly give people updates as to your whereabouts . "
In Loopt for iPhone , " users must be logged in and ping locations from people , [ whereas ]
Android owners will be able to enjoy always - on , always - available status . "
Still , there is no shortage of developers who continue to apply to download Apple 's SDK for the ever - marketing - savvy price of $ 99 .
Not only does Apple build excitement , it creates desire .
Meanwhile the relatively unassuming Android is open source , free to download and document , and is the flagship software of the 48 - member - strong Open Handset Alliance .
If only currently available on the G1 phone , Android is set to run on upcoming gPhones manufactured by HTC , Samsung , Sony Ericsson , Motorola , Toshiba , LG , ASUS , Garmin and Huawei , and will be supported by mobile networks including T - Mobile , Sprint Nextel , Vodafone , China Mobile , KDDI , DoCoMo , Softbank Mobile , Telecom Italia and Telefónica .
As for monetary remuneration , paid Android applications are already available from third - party sites such as Handango and MobiHand 's OnlyAndroid , but will also soon appear in the official Android Market .
However security is always a concern in such open environments , and device - specific nuances may vary uncontrollably from handset to handset .
But if this sounds vaguely familiar , perhaps we can recall the relationship between Web browsers and the Internet circa 1995 .
" Open and closed platforms each have their own set of pros and cons , " observes Alex Ahlund , founder of AppVee.com , a site that offers comprehensive reviews of applications for both iPhone and Android .
" On the plus side , with Android being so open , developers can take advantage of all the features of a device and release applications without [ Apple's ] lengthy ( and sometimes , unpredictable ) approval process .
The flip side to that is a platform loses its ease of use , elegance , and filter when there are no proper gatekeepers . "
Long - term winner ?
As they said in the prime time of the dot - com bubble : Developers hate designers because they dress nice and have friends ; designers fear developers because they have the power to make the magic .
Does Android hate Apple any more than Apple fears Android ?
And in particularly wired and trend - conscious societies such as Hong Kong , South Korea and Japan , it 's often the handset that sells the rest .
" No matter how good the iPhone is , it will not be able to come up with new models every month compared to Symbian - and Windows - based phones , " remarks Dr. Lawrence Cheung of the Hong Kong Productivity Council .
" I am a bit skeptical about the gPhone .
The slim and sexy look of a phone is particularly important in Asia , " says Cheung .
Ahlund is more optimistic for Google 's flagship OS : " The long - term potential market share is what gives Android the edge .
The iPhone is going to continue growing with a massive community and hardware updates to keep up with new mobile demands , but in my opinion Android is and will be the de facto operating system for most future handsets . "
" We are going to see a huge shift in the next five years , " he continues , " with a lot of our computing life being pulled away from the desk ( and lap ) into our pocket .
We 're constantly evolving as a mobile society , and since we have finally realized that processing power and ease of use is possible without being plugged - in and stationary , we 're going to start seeing more and more digital nomads . "
We have already verbalized " googling " for searching on the Web .
The question now is , will the next branded synonym of " smartphone " be iPhone or gPhone ?

During last week 's touring WinHEC conference in Beijing , attendees were treated to the latest Windows 7 build running in a virtual machine .
Trouble is , someone apparently pilfered a copy of the VHD , and now it 's loose .
The security around uninstalled copies of Windows 7 is fairly tight .
But the security around a copy that has been installed to a PC 's virtual machine , might not be tight at all .
So an attendee at last week 's Beijing WinHEC conference was apparently able to copy the VHD file for the virtual machine to a thumb drive , before uploading it to a Web file host , and providing the link to a very popular Chinese beta news site ( not affiliated with BetaNews ) .
As of late Monday afternoon , East Coast time , the Web host was not serving the file in question , although posters to the news site 's forum indicate that many people already downloaded and ran the VHD file successfully .
While some bestowed positive comments on the uploader , which translated into English through Google as " hero , " other comments we found appeared to accuse him of being an agent of foreign governments seeking to sublimate the Chinese people through the systematic infusion of what clearly translated as something we can't print .
Advertisement
Screenshots attributed to the pilfered VHD include a build number 6951 plus other identifying data , which matches photographs of the verified Windows 7 made during the conference .
It could either underscore the veracity of the screenshots , or attest to the acumen of some forger with a lot of time on his hands .
We do n't expect Microsoft to verify this information , though as soon as tomorrow , developers in Houston should be able to at least see , most likely touch , and possibly take with them , the first official betas of Windows 7 .
If the screenshots are indeed valid , then they reveal two very important developments since the last developers ' release we saw last October : While Microsoft 's design crew have been experimenting with a revised taskbar that has removed the text labels used since Windows 95 , the recent screenshots indicate that text may have returned as an option , at least for this build that premiered in Asia .
This iteration of the taskbar is actually more familiar and less changed than the ones we 've seen before , although text can apparently be turned off .
And certain icons previously attributed to the QuickLaunch toolbar ( still absent ) remain present in the taskbar , interspersed among the running applications .
The logic of how they 're dispersed has yet to be determined .
Also , in a development that should evoke the comment , " Oh , yeah ! " from everyone who thus far has seen it but not noticed it ... the Aero windows have semi-transparent borders .
Of course , that 's a feature that premiered in Windows Vista .
But in a virtual machine , semi- transparency does n't typically work because the virtual video driver in Microsoft 's Virtual PC does not enable full DirectX 9 compatibility .
This could indicate either that the screenshots ( if valid ) were taken on a more sophisticated platform than normal ( still possible ) , or that Build 6951 contains the new feature blogger Long Zheng revealed two weeks ago : a software rendering engine currently called WARP10 that enables graphics made for DirectX 10 to be rendered on cards that could just barely physically support DirectX 9 .
Commenters on Zheng 's story were wondering if WARP10 would enable high - level graphics rendering , such as that seen in the game Crysis , on virtual machines .
Assuming all the " if's " in our story to this point have been checked off , the answer could be yes .

The U.S. military Saturday admitted it while responding to an insurgent ambush has killed 37 civilians and wounded 35 others in southern Afghanistan 's Kandahar , a Taliban heartland .
Militants , who came in large numbers to Wech Baghtu village of Shah Wali Kot district , fired at a joint patrol of Afghan national security forces and the U.S. - led forces there Monday and then close air support was called in by the military to suppress the rebels , the U.S. forces said in report of a joint probe with Afghan government .
The air strike however hit a wedding gathering at the village , causing a lot of civilian casualties , according to locals .
Haji Roozi Khan , a local villager and eyewitness , earlier told Xinhua 37 civilians including 10 women , 23 children died and over 30 others including the bride sustained injuries in the air raid lasting from around 2 p.m. until late that night .
" Insurgents fired at ANSF and Coalition forces from some of the villagers ' homes while using the homes for cover , " the report issued by the U.S. military said Saturday , citing local elders .
" The villagers also stated that insurgents prevented the families from leaving the village , indicating a deliberate attempt to cause civilian casualties , " it added .
The report came a day after Afghan government officials revealed their investigation result indicating the almost the same figure of civilian casualties .
Some 26 Taliban militants also perished in the air bombing , according to Afghan officials .
Afghan President Hamid Karzai , who has in the past for several times asked the U.S. - led foreign troops to avoid harming civilians , condemned the incident .
His government reportedly has announced a 2,000 U.S. dollars ' compensation for each killed civilian .
Over 1,500 civilians have been killed in Afghan violence this year , either by the militants or the Afghan and international troops , according to UN officials .
The Afghanistan - based U.S. and NATO troops , who are 70,000 - strong and fighting an escalating Taliban - led insurgency , mostly relying on air raids to kill insurgents , continue to mis - strike civilian targets , due to misleading information or aimless firing among others , despite repeated appeals from Afghan authorities for ending civilian casualties .
The worst one in years was on Aug. 22 when a U.S. airstrike in western Herat province , according to UN and Afghan government probes , claimed over 90 civilian lives , which prompted Afghan cabinet to pass a historic resolution asking for a re-regulation of foreign troops ' presence in the post - Taliban nation .
The U.S. however later in a probe confirmed only 33 civilians died in the raid .
Continuous civilian killings by the foreign troops , which are considered sensitive , have spurred common Afghans ' anger , if not hatred , towards U.S. - led foreign troops and undermined the popularity of Afghan government .
It is also believed that such cases have strained relations between Karzai administration and its western backers .
Karzai Wednesday while congratulating on Barack Obama 's victory in U.S. presidential elections called on the U.S. new leadership to prevent from harming civilians in their Afghan military operations .
" Our first demand is to avoid harming civilians in Afghanistan , " Karzai said .
In a related development , the U.S. - led Coalition and the NATO troops Wednesday in an air attack on militants who were attacking Afghan government ground troops killed seven civilians , along with13 insurgents in northwestern Badghis province , local police said .

Update :
The pregnant woman was injured ; she did not miscarry as stated in early reports of the incident .
I ’ve never understood what would move someone to get up early and be at a store at 5:00 am on the day after Thanksgiving .
The crowds , the hassle , and the grotesqueness of over - consuming is enough to make me stay away from any store on Black Friday .
Apparently , I am not alone , as today is also Buy Nothing Day .
[ social_buttons ]
Today is Buy Nothing Day :
Suddenly , we ran out of money and , to avoid collapse , we quickly pumped liquidity back into the system .
But behind our financial crisis a much more ominous crisis looms : we are running out of nature … fish , forests , fresh water , minerals , soil .
What are we going to do when supplies of these vital resources run low ?
There ’s only one way to avoid the collapse of this human experiment of ours on Planet Earth : we have to consume less .
It will take a massive mindshift .
You can start the ball rolling by buying nothing on November 28th .
Then celebrate Christmas differently this year , and make a New Year ’s resolution to change your lifestyle in 2009 .
It ’s now or never !
Tragically , two souls have been lost already on this Black Friday .
When the doors opened at a Long Island Wal - Mart at 5:00 am , a worker was trampled to death and a woman miscarried .
The worker was an overnight stock clerk who was trying to hold back the unruly crowd of shoppers .
Even as the man was trampled and gasping for air , shoppers continued to rush over and around him .
A pregnant woman was also knocked down .
When the paramedics arrived , they told her there was nothing they could do for the baby that was already gone .
Sadly , shoppers just kept entering the store without paying attention to the dead man on the ground and the pregnant woman who lost her baby .
This story breaks my heart .
Consumerism is not only killing our environment and culture , it is literally killing people too .
There are so many things wrong with this story .
If I would have been the owner of the store , I would have closed the store ’s doors for the day in honor of the loss of life ; however , I doubt the megastore did anything out of respect .

Goldberg 's column does n't make us say ' Whoopi ! '
by Jeremy Hooper
Here 's the intro to a new piece from conservative writer Jonah Goldberg .
Read it and then we 'll get back to you :
Did you catch the political ad in which two Jews ring the doorbell of a nice , working - class family ?
They barge in and rifle through the wife 's purse and then the man 's wallet for any cash .
Cackling , they smash the daughter 's piggy bank and pinch every penny .
" We need it for the Wall Street bailout ! " they exclaim .
No ?
Maybe you saw the one with the two swarthy Muslims who knock on the door of a nice Jewish family and then blow themselves up ?
No ?
Well , then surely you saw the TV ad in which two smarmy Mormon missionaries knock on the door of an attractive lesbian couple .
" Hi , we 're from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints ! " says the blond one with a toothy smile .
" We 're here to take away your rights . "
The Mormon zealots yank the couple 's wedding rings from their fingers and then tear up their marriage license .
As the thugs leave , one says to the other , " That was too easy . "
His smirking comrade replies , " Yeah , what should we ban next ? "
The voice - over implores viewers : " Say no to a church taking over your government . "
Obviously , the first two ads are fictional because no one would dare run such anti-Semitic or anti-Muslim attacks .
The third ad , however , was real .
It was broadcast throughout California on election day as part of the effort to rally opposition to Proposition 8 , the initiative that successfully repealed the right to same - sex marriage in the state .
An Ugly Attack on Mormons [ NRO ]
Okay , so it 's yet another attempt to spin Prop 8 so that it 's victims , rather than its proponents , look " intolerant . "
These offensive attempts to wash the stench of bias off their hands have become so frequent in the days since the election that we 've mostly started ignoring them .
However , this one could not go unmentioned for two reasons .
( 1 ) It 's deeply flawed .
( 2 ) It itself reads to us as unintentionally anti-semitic and anti-Muslim .
The flawed part ?
Well , the Mormon ad was not based on rumor , conjecture , or opinion .
The simple fact is that the LDS church contributed a crapload of cash to the Prop 8 effort .
Without their bankrolling , it 's highly unlikely that the discriminatory measure would 've passed .
So since the Mormons chose to enter the political arena to the tune of $ 20 + million dollars , they also signed themselves up for political scrutiny .
This ad ( which you can view here ) was exactly that : A political reaction to a political situation .
And you can best believe that if a gay - affirming church had done the same thing on our side , the " yes " side would 've attacked early and often , with numerous jabs at how un-Biblical they perceive the liberal sect 's views .
As for the unintentional anti-semitic and anti-Muslim undertones in Goldberg 's words ?
Well , he 's willfully presenting a crude , stereotypical portrait of both Jews and Muslims just so that he can make his flawed point .
And the weird thing is that the setup is not only off - putting -- it 's also completely misplaced .
The Mormon ad did n't take easy jabs at Mormon stereotypes .
There were n't any jokes about polygamy .
There were n't any " magic underwear " mentions .
The only aspect of Mormon culture that was touched upon was the door to door , white shirt - laden outreach efforts .
The only points made in the ad were facts about the Mormon church 's donations , which exist in a tangible , demonstrable form on the easily accessible public donor rolls .
Yet Goldberg likens the ad to theoretical ones featuring cruel stereotypes about " money - grubbing " Jews and " jihadist " Muslims ?
Sorry , but that 's objectionable .
Look , it 's one thing if these conservatives want to defend Prop 8 on its perceived merits .
But the idea that Mormons should be able to enter the political arena in such a major way and then just walk way without any scrutiny is offensive to the discourse .
Mr. Goldberg 's piece only serves to ratchet that offense up a few more notches .
** UPDATE : And of course the " yes on 8 " folks are highlighting Goldberg 's piece on their site .
So desperate for validation , that crew .
Your thoughts
correct me if I am wrong , but that never actually " aired " as an advertisement .
It was an internet ad made by an independent group that got so much interset online that it became a topic for dicsussion on news shows and they showed the ad as part of the " news " .
Big difference .
As an Ex -Mormon , I am getting really tired of the " mormons as victim " thing going around .

This guy is a moron , and his final statement makes it clear : " My own view is that gay marriage is likely inevitable and wo n’t be nearly the disaster many of my fellow conservatives fear it will be .
But the scorched - earth campaign to victory pushed by gay - marriage advocates may well be disastrous , and “ liberals ” should be ashamed for countenancing it . "
Scorched earth ?
I wonder how Mr. Goldberg would react to his rights being banned by the masses ?
He even agrees same sex marriage wo n't be the disaster some of him idiot compatriots believe it will be .
Yet , he looks down on our passionate efforts to lift the jackboot from our throats .
Johan M - O - R - O - N ' Goldberg ' should be ashamed of himself .

Who are bigger pussies than bullies ?
Brave people , like us LGBT - ers , defend ourselves and fight for our rights .
We address the lies and misconceptions , sometimes through quiet conversations , sometimes with protests .
We know that the knocks are part of the struggle and we keep our eyes on winning .
Pussies , like Goldberg and I would suggest 99 % of the religious right , are so insecure that the only thing they can claim is victimhood .
AND THEY ARE THE ONES VICTIMIZING !
Slapping you , slandering you , and dehumanizing you - and you dare to put your hand up and say " um , hello , that hurts " and suddenly you are drowned in their tears .
Poor little pussies .
Well , in the immortal words of Paul Young , we 're " gonna tear your playhouse down ... real soon ! ! "
p.s. and I use " pussies " in a completely non-female - denigrating sort of way .

Poor Doughy Pantload . . .
He 's good at whining , hyperbole , and missing the point , but his reasoning and logic are n't the best .

Bullies always whine and cry when their victims defend themselves .
These stories always give me nasty school flashbacks .
Posted by : RainbowPhoenix | Dec 4 , 2008 9:02:18 PM
Please remember that Jonah Goldberg is generally taken as the type specimen of " stupid . "
He could n't construct a decent argument with a blueprint .
He 's just parroting the pro-Prop 8 mantra that any attack on them is bigotry and a violation of their religious freedom , except he's not very smart nor nearly as witty as he thinks he is , so it 's kind of embarrassing .
I feel bad for his mother -- lord knows what it took to get him that job at NRO , even with her connections .
Posted by : Hunter | Dec 5 , 2008 7:22:08 AM
My theory is that she had compromising photos of Jonah , and threatened to force the people at NRO to look at them if they did n't hire him .

BAGHDAD , Iraq ( CNN ) --
The monument commemorating the journalist who hurled his shoes at President George W. Bush was taken down a day after it was erected , local officials in Tikrit told CNN .
A monument to a shoe thrown at former President Bush is unveiled at the Tikrit Orphanage complex .
Assisted by kids at the Tikrit Orphanage , sculptor Laith al - Amiri on Tuesday erected a huge brown replica of one of the shoes hurled at Bush last month by journalist Muntadhir al - Zaidi during a press conference in Baghdad .
But officials from Salaheddin province told CNN that the monument was removed after a request from the central government , which has charges pending against al - Zaidi -- now in an Iraqi jail .
After the request was made , Iraqi police visited the location to make sure that the shoe monument was removed .
" We will not allow anyone to use the government facilities and buildings for political motives , " said Abdullah Jabara , Salaheddin deputy governor .
Al - Zaidi's angry gesture touched a defiant nerve throughout the Arab and Muslim world .
He is regarded by many people as a hero , and demonstrators last month took to the streets in the Arab world and called for his release .
The shoe monument , made of fiberglass and coated with copper , consists of the shoe and a concrete base .
The entire monument is 3.5 meters ( 11.5 feet ) high .
The shoe is 2.5 meters ( 8.2 feet ) long and 1.5 meters ( 4.9 feet ) wide .
The orphans helped al - Amiri build the $ 5,000 structure in 15 days , said Faten Abdulqader al - Naseri , the orphanage director .
" Those orphans who helped the sculptor in building this monument were the victims of Bush 's war , " al - Naseri said .
" The shoe monument is a gift to the next generation to remember the heroic action by the journalist . "
Saddam Hussein , the former Iraqi leader toppled by the United States in 2003 , was from the Tikrit region .
Al - Zaidi marked his 30th birthday in jail earlier this month .
One of his brothers told CNN he " in good health and is being treated well . "
Al - Zaidi's employer , TV network al - Baghdadia , keeps a picture of him at the top left side of the screen with a calendar showing the number of days he has spent in detention .
The network has been calling for his release .
By tradition , throwing a shoe , is the most insulting act in the Arab world .
CNN 's Mohammed Tawfeeq contributed to this report .

Realtors Ask Feds for Reduction in Owner - Occupancy Ratio
The National Association of Realtors ® ( NAR ) recently called on the Department of Housing and Urban Development ( HUD ) and the Federal Housing Finance Administration ( FHFA ) to reduce the owner - occupied ratio requirement for condominium complexes .
In letters to HUD Secretary Steven C. Preston and James B. Lockhart , III , Director of FHFA , NAR President Gaylord asked that the two agencies reduce the current requirement that 51 percent of individual units within a condo development be owner occupied for that unit to qualify for Freddie Mac , Fannie Mae , or Federal Housing Administration loans .
The Association also asked that bank - owned real estate resulting from foreclosures not be counted as non-owner occupied in calculating the 51 percent ratio .
The letters said that NAR recommends that the government sponsored enterprises ( GSEs ) reduce the occupancy ratio for GSE and FHA mortgages slightly " to a number below 50 percent for all condominium developments that have vacant units as a result of bank foreclosures .
However , the number should not be reduced so much that it creates a development that is primarily investor - owned and harms the value or appreciation of owner - occupied units . "
The loans meeting the rule of these agencies are generally the most accessible to borrowers and usually carry the lowest interest rates .
Particularly in the current credit squeeze purchasers of condos may find it nearly impossible to arrange other types of funding .
Gaylord 's letters said , " Amending the owner - occupancy rules for condominium developments for buyers with GSE or FHA mortgages will .
Lenders will have the opportunity to move REO properties off their books because the units could be eligible for buyers with GSE or FHA mortgages .
Further , individuals and families purchasing units in these developments with GSE or FHA loans will have access to more flexible and affordable financing opportunities . "
They " will have a wider choice of condominium developments .
Finally , existing owners in these developments will benefit as vacant units are purchased and occupied and the owner - occupied ratio increases . "
The last banking crisis in the late 1980s struck , at least in New England , on the heels of a frenzy of condominium conversions and construction which heavily targeted investors .
Even the most upscale developments had investors who bought units ( some costing over $ 350 per square foot ) at pre-construction prices to hold for a few years and resell .
On the lower end investors bought blocks of five , ten , or more units in older apartment buildings which were being " condominiumized . "
A common ploy was for the buildings ' converters to offer the units for no money down , taking back what was often an illegal second mortgage equivalent to the downpayment .
The profit margin on these conversions was so large that developers were not even particularly concerned about the junior liens being repaid .
When the crash came and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) became the owner of hundreds of condominium units throughout the region it found that very few of the foreclosed properties were in GSE or FHA approved developments because of the owner - occupancy ratio requirement .
Many of the heavily investor - owned complexes , however , were virtually destroyed ; unit prices had dropped to nearly nothing .
One complex in Manchester , New Hampshire had been sold to investors in blocks of eight units for $ 54,000 per unit .
A pre-foreclosure appraisal conducted for FDIC priced each unit between $ 5,400 and $ 7,000 .
Condo associations were unable to continue the most basic maintenance , and several complexes were so far - gone they were ultimately demolished .
The reduction of ratios requested by NAR are probably not so extreme as to cause these types of problems and may well encourage responsible investors to step up and take properties off of bank balance sheets .
Getting individual units back into private ownership would also give condominium associations more control over collecting monthly fees which would stabilize building services and maintenance .
Perhaps , however , if HUD and FHFA do concede to NAR 's request , they might consider making the reduction in owner - occupied ratio temporary , so as not to create a second wave of investor - generated nonsense eight or ten years down the road .
Ebola haemorrhagic fever in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
26 December 2008 - The Ministry of Health ( MoH ) of the Democratic Republic of the Congo declared on 25 December an outbreak of Ebola haemorrhagic fever in Mweka District , Kasai Occidental province based on laboratory results from the Centre International de Recherches Médicales de Franceville ( CIRMF ) in Gabon .
CIRMF confirmed the presence of Ebola virus in 2 samples from 2 of the patients in the outbreak by antigen detection .
In addition , laboratory tests conducted by Institut National de Recherches Biologiques ( INRB ) in Kinshasa , also confirmed the presence of Shigella .
As of 26 December , WHO is aware of 34 suspected cases including 9 deaths ( CFR 26 % ) associated with the ongoing event .
Additional samples have been collected and are en route to INRB .
The WHO Country Office , Regional Office and Headquarters are supporting the MoH in Kinshasa and in the field at the location of the outbreak .
In addition , the WHO Country Office is supporting the operational costs of the investigation and response teams and has deployed four vehicles to the field .
Additional staff , outbreak response equipment and supplies , including Personal Protective Equipment ( PPE ) , are also being sent to the area .
An enhanced team of national and international experts is being mobilized to implement control strategies for Ebola haemorrhagic fever and to support outbreak field response in the province .
WHO is working together with laboratory partners to provide comprehensive laboratory services , and to support the MoH in the control and investigation of the outbreak .
WHO is unaware of any reports signaling the international spread of disease and advises against the application of any travel or trade restrictions upon the Democratic Republic of the Congo .

Will scientists ever stop destroying our lives ?
We 're sorry to report , men , that according to a new study , masturbating throughout your 20s and 30s will totally give you cancer .
A UK study of more than 800 men found that internet porn really came along at the wrong time , for you :
Men who are very sexually active in their twenties and thirties are more likely to develop prostate cancer , especially if they masturbate frequently , according to a study of more than 800 men .
However the UK research team also found that frequent sexual activity in a man 's forties appears to have little effect and even small levels of activity in a man 's fifties could offer protection from the disease .
Most of the differences were attributed to masturbation rather than sexual intercourse .
Do n't worry dude .
They also found that men who get prostate cancer , on average , had more sexual partners .
So , you know , that 's probably how you got it .

So while the December 7th date for the Vado HD might be an educated guess , the details including that $ 200 price tag certainly look real enough .
The display still measures 2 - inches , but the beefier 3.3 x 7.9 x 6.3 - inch solid state camcorder now brings 8 GB of storage for up to 2 hours of 720 p MPEG - 4 recordings -- 8 hours at VGA quality .
It also ships with an HDMI cable for instant playback to your like - equipped television .
Otherwise , slot the cam into your PC's ( XP and Vista , only ) USB port to instantly share your works to YouTube and others with the help of the cam 's built - in Vado Central Software .

Woke Up This Morning , Got Myself a Gun
I thought maybe he would feel better in the morning .
Nope .
I am still bothered by the many liberties to be lost under an Obama presidency and liberal Democratic Congress .
Starting January 20 , I am going to keep a list of liberties lost .
I 'll probably seed a list of liberties likely to lose .
Perhaps in all the excitement yesterday you missed the news that Chuck Schumer said he wants to bring back the Fairness Doctrine .
As those of us following along with actual issues are aware , Obama is going to be the most anti-gun President in history , if he follows through on his stated views , his voting history , and so on .
He supported the DC gun ban , which he admits was unconstitutional .
He said the expiration of the so - called " assault weapons " ban was a " tragedy . "
He supports banning a lot of ammo , and making a lot more prohibitively expensive .
Despite his claim of supporting an " individual right " to keep and bear arms , it 's obvious his definition of " right " means the government can restrict that " right " into oblivion .
And his friends in the Congress , like the aforementioned Schumer , will go along with any gun restriction they can get their hands on .
That he came out on Election Day and talked about restricting the First Amendment tells you that these people are not afraid of anything right now .
So , it 's time to stock up , while we still can .
I am thinking M - 4 carbine , a bunch of large clips , and as much inexpensive ammo as I can get my hands on .

DETROIT 
One of the biggest boosters of the American auto industry said Tuesday that he was bailing out of his large stake in the Ford Motor Company  a stinging no -confidence vote that raised the anxiety level in this city over the deepening troubles of the Big Three car companies .
By starting to sell off his $ 1 billion bet on Ford , an investment that is now worth less than $ 300 million , the financier Kirk Kerkorian joined the growing ranks of investors who have soured on Detroit ’s prospects because of plummeting sales and mounting losses .
Mr. Kerkorian ’s abrupt decision to back away from Ford comes just six months after he began building his stake .
It also follows an effort by the private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management to try to sell Chrysler to General Motors after spending $ 7.4 billion a year ago to acquire the smallest of the Big Three automakers .
G.M. and Cerberus need banks and other investors to provide financing for the deal .
But the tenuous state of the industry has made prospective investors , so far , hesitant to back the merger .

Long - standing argument with my 6 - year - old ; she thinks Santa is real and I disagree .
She thinks I 'm needlessly skeptical .
Interestingly , at this point I have n't bought a single Christmas present this year .
I mean , there 's still time for me to win this argument .
The global recession is having an impact on China , but not one that is expected to halt the growth in military spending .
Currently , China expects the growth of its economy will slip , from the 11.9 percent last year , to five percent or less this year .
That would be the lowest annual growth for several decades , and it might get worse .
Nevertheless , the government is spending hundreds of billions of dollars to soften the blow of lost jobs .
A million or more unemployed workers could cause social disorder that might get out of hand .
Japan , China and South Korea are forming a joint disaster preparedness organization .
The three would pool information and disaster relief resources , for natural disasters like widespread earthquakes or typhoons that have an impact on all three countries .
This cooperation would involve purely civilian agencies , as well as some military ones .
Recent talks between the president of France and the Dali Lama ( the unofficial leader of those who campaign for Tibetan independence ) angered China , and diplomatic protests were made .
France ignored this , but now the French embassy in China is under hacker attack and largely shut down .
The Chinese government denies any responsibility .
Former Taiwanese president Chen is being prosecuted for corruption .
Chen resigned last August because of the charges .
His family has been investigated for corruption over the last two years .
Corruption is more common in China , but more often prosecuted in Taiwan .
China is demanding that the United States cancel arms sales to Taiwan , and refuses to resume U.S. - China military cooperation and exchanges until those arms sales are cancelled .
India has sent over a hundred troops to China for joint counter - terror training .
These exercises are to work out differences in communications and tactics , so that future joint operations will go more smoothly .
China has set free a thousand of the those arrested during the separatist riots in Tibet last March .
Hundreds more have been prosecuted and sent to prison .
Thousands of additional riot police remain in Tibet , and the secret police keep a closer eye on anyone suspected of separatist attitudes .
Recruiting of informers in separatist circles has increased , and Chinese officials in Tibet are under orders to prevent another uprising , or else ( they lose their jobs , or even their freedom . )
Google Web site -- and many of the company 's software programs -- are loaded with gags , goofs , and Easter eggs that have helped Google maintain a fun-loving spirit in the cutthroat world of Web competition .

All of us need to get things done .
Few of us have the genius or the vision to come up with a system for , you know , getting things done .
David Allen , sensing this particular void in the productivity and self - help book marketplace , published the aptly titled Getting Things Done in 2001 , which was soon followed by a sequel called Ready for Anything .
On Tuesday , Allen ’s latest opus , Making It All Work , hits bookstores .
Not surprisingly , Allen ’s “ art of stress - free productivity ” has inspired a raft of applications for the iPhone and iPod touch aimed at putting his principles into practice .
OmniFocus ( ) is sort of the 800 - pound gorilla of GTD applications , but instead of revisiting that , I looked at a few simpler tools available at the App Store .

Habits by Louis Franco helps users form good habits , which sounds simple enough .
But developing habits requires a bit of time and discipline .
It requires repetition and awareness .
Habits keeps your calendar free from clutter associated with routine tasks or the general stuff of life .
Whether the habit is walking four miles a day or calling your mom , you do n’t necessarily need to do it every day or every week , and you do n’t necessarily need to do it at a prescribed time , but you need to do it .
Habits keeps your habits organized and keeps score of how well you do .
You can set up your habits for every day , every other day , every weekend , every few days , every week and every month .
I would also suggest giving users the option of selecting every morning or every evening .
Habits ’ home screen shows what you need to do right now , or soon .
Tap the item and then tap a button indicating whether you “ did it , ” or “ skip it , ” or “ pause ” — a helpful feature if you are on the road , for example .
The app will show you when you last performed the task , and display a percentage of how often you did the task early or on time , and how often you were late or skipped .
You can also change how often you will perform the particular task .
The one habit that Habits cannot help you form is the habit of regularly checking in with Habits .
If you ca n’t manage that , you ’ve got real problems .
On the other hand , Habits could use an alarm or a daily e-mail reminder .
( As long as you remember to set up the cursed thing . )
GTD weighs heavily on lists and list - making , and a pair of apps aim to help expedite that process .
I wanted to like Buckaroo Software ’s CheckOff more than I do , and as a simple checklist app , it has a few features to commend it .
You can create checklist templates with ease .
Even more impressive , the app will auto - create lists on specific days of the week .
If you have a certain routine you follow every Tuesday and Friday , for example , CheckOff can generate a list from the template you ’ve set up for those days .
If you need to deviate from routine and add or subtract an item , you simply tap the edit key , make your changes , and save .
You can also create one - time checklists without relying on a template .
I find this feature particularly useful for creating grocery lists and lists of items my family needs for trips .
CheckOff shows you your progress by listing unfinished and completed checklists .
Unfinished lists display with a small pie-chart like icon , giving you an approximate idea of your progress .
CheckOff is more sophisticated than Habits , but does not compare well to a more comprehensive productivity app such as OmniFocus or Cultured Code ’s more user - friendly Things ( ) .
Of course , those applications — which are considerably more expensive than those under review — are also companion tools for desktop software .
Neither CheckOff nor Habits sync with your desktop or laptop .
They are much simpler apps , with narrower functions .
You take the good , you take the bad .
Another key feature of GTD is the Two - Minute Rule :
Do anything you absolutely must do that you can do right now in two minutes or less .
“ Do it , ” Allen writes .
“ If an action will take less than two minutes , it should be done at the moment it is defined . ”
Return that call , answer that e-mail .
You will see a ten - fold time benefit over the long term .
Developing a two - minute timer app was a no - brainer .
Hobbyist Software ’s GTD 2 Min Timer does exactly what it says .
Launch the app and the timer starts immediately , which is a bit disconcerting at first .
Timer lets you select from 11 alarm sounds — the default factory whistle is appropriate for the tool .
Or you can turn the alarm off .
If all GTD 2 Min Timer did were count down two minutes and whistle at you , it would hardly be worth a dollar .
You can use the scroll wheel to set the timer for up to an hour and start and stop at any time , which makes it a useful app for keeping meetings under control .
Finish your task early , and simply tap the app ’s reset button and the timer will restart at two minutes — or whatever time you ’ve set on the wheel .
I can think of a few of former editors of mine who would benefit from GTD , come to think of it .
Bottom line :
If you are looking for simple , clever tools to help you be productive , these apps may fit the bill .
But if comprehensive tools are what you seek , you will be disappointed .
The applications are compatible with any iPhone or iPod touch running the iPhone 2.x software update .

GE has reportedly stopped working on Incandescent light bulbs .
They actually had plans to make efficient and clean Incandescent bulbs , and even had working prototypes , but they scrapped those plans because governments are starting to ban those kind of light sources .
GE will instead focus on LEDs and OLEDs .
GE has stated before that it hopes to have OLED light products by 2010 .
Liberal interest groups , think tanks , lobbyists , bloggers and other nuisances are inundating the incoming Obama Administration with advice , but James Hansen recently managed to say something interesting .
Namely , the famous NASA scientist had the nerve to expose some of the global - warming fantasies widespread among children and politicians .
No , the spiritual leader of the climate - change movement has n't recanted .
Global warming threatens " not simply the Earth , but the fate of all its species , including humanity , " he writes in ...
As George Bush shuffles off to a long absence that is not only with leave but with a heartfelt global sentiment that it is long overdue , he leaves behind a lot of unfinished business .
One wonders whether , just in case , he will smuggle in a pardon for himself for his technical desertion and very definite absence without leave from the Texas Air National Guard .
What is really in order is some sort of pardon and apology to Dan Rather , who CBS 's cowardly management squeezed from 60 Minutes for telling the truth about Bush 's war record .
Rather 's suit against them , with its accompanying subpoenas , has now revealed that in their eagerness to throw a sacrificial victim to the swiftboating bloggers with their escorting media sharks , CBS management actually considered such paragons of journalistic objectivity as Ann Coulter , Rush Limbaugh , William Kristol , William Safire and William Buckley for the investigating panel .
Their concern was to counter the " reputation " of the network 's liberal bias .
In the end , they settled on Dick Thornburgh , the Republican former attorney general appointed by the deserter - in - chief 's dad , although apparently Roger Ailes , Fox News 's brain was also under consideration .
Indeed , since they discussed the composition of this panel with the Republican party and Viacom 's Washington lobbyists , it may even have been Republican operatives who had the good sense to realise that a Limbaugh or Coulter may not have the desired " reputation " of objectivity and credibility .
The investigation carefully did not consider the veracity of the charges against Bush , simply the provenance of the scrap of paper , but by the time it was over , many people who should have known better assumed that the story of Bush 's desertion was refuted .
In fact , the evidence was compelling .
Many others , myself included in my book , Deserter , had proved that George Bush joined the Texas Air National Guard with nepotistic backing in order to avoid service in Vietnam , a war that he agreed with .
And then he went missing and failed to fulfill the terms of his service , an offence for which other less well - connected people were going to prison or being drafted to the jungle .
Let us consider the sins of Rather .
Firstly , he admitted openly what everyone knew – that anchormen are performers not journalists .
Secondly , 60 Minutes pandered to the television need for a McGuffin to wave around .
However , it is still not proven that the memo under consideration was a forgery .
What has been proven beyond doubt was that the information in it was accurate .
The very secretary who said that she had not typed that particular piece of paper attested that she had typed exactly that same message .
The kindest explanation for CBS , other than outright political complicity , is that it paid the Danegeld , yet again , to keep the conservative hordes off its back by pandering to the Republican party .
In a sense , it was not unique since most of the media were in post - 9/11 , post - Iraq mode mesmerised into thinking that any criticism of the Bush administration was treachery in the face of the enemy .
It is not as if the Democratic benches hosted a swelling chorus of dissent either .
Rupert Murdoch cited the case last week : " Far from celebrating this citizen journalism , the establishment media reacted defensively .
During an appearance on Fox News , a CBS executive attacked the bloggers in a statement that will go down in the annals of arrogance .
' 60 Minutes , ' he said , was a professional organisation with ' multiple layers of checks and balances ' .
By contrast , he dismissed the blogger as ' a guy sitting in his living room in his pajamas writing ' .
But eventually it was the guys sitting in their pajamas who forced Mr Rather and his producer to resign . "
No it was not .
It was because the " mainstream media " – not least Murdoch 's – took up the bloggers against Rather and amplified their case .
In a sense , this defines the essence of swiftboating as an Olympic event .
The bloggers , backed by Fox , the rightwing talk radio jocks and the editorial pages of the WSJ with their hangers - on at the Standard , National Review etc , will conjure up a perfect storm of vituperation against their target , be it Kerry , Kofi Annan , or Dan Rather , and put everyone on the defensive .
The technique is to generate so much smoke that no one notices that there is no fire .
But for some reason the evidence against Bush , abounding in small and regional publications and on the web , was not taken up with the same assiduity .
So much for Murdoch 's concern for blogs – and for CBS 's journalistic standards in the face of its owner Viacom 's need to keep in with the Bush White House .

Everyone seems to be paying attention to what the CEOs of America 's automakers are driving to the auto bailout hearings on Capitol Hill .
General Motors noticed this , and sensed an opportunity .
GM CEO Rick Wagoner will reportedly arrive at Congressional hearings today in a 2010 Chevy Volt
Or rather , in the closest thing he could find .
Autoblog explains , " As it seems every press outlet will be covering the roadtrip adventures of the three Detroit leaders as they travel via wheeled transportation to the capitol to beg for billions ( remember , no corporate jets this time ) , Wagoner has wisely dumped the ho -hum hybrid Chevrolet Malibu in favor of a Chevy Volt mule in a Chevy Cruze body during at least the last few highly - visible miles of his journey " Wagoner will still make most of the journey in a 2009 Chevy Malibu Hybrid ... but not all of it .
" To take full advantage of the public display , GM will also bring a show version of the highly - anticipated 2011 Chevy Volt to the capitol and put it on display when Wagoner arrives at the Russell Senate Building around 9:30 AM . "
According to Detroit Free Press , the Volt used for this portion of the trip will be " a prototype Volt wearing the sheet metal of the upcoming Chevrolet Cruze . "
The Volt , a plug - in hybrid vehicle designed to drive up to 40 miles at highway speed on battery power alone , is planned for the 2010 or 2011 model year .
The Volt 's body has been shown to the press , and its drivetrain has been tested inside the bodies of other cars ( known in the industry as " mules " ) , but the two have never been shown together - and the press has never been allowed close enough to inspect the car 's propulsion system .
Battery technology is the limiting factor in every hybrid 's development - we do n't yet know whether the Volt 's batteries can do everything GM claims the car will do .
It is n't clear that the Volt testing mules can reach highway speed under battery power , or how long their batteries last .
According to Jalopnik , Wagoner will drive the Volt mule from his Washington hotel to " a 9:30 AM rally at the corner of Delaware Ave. and C street just outside the Russell Senate Building . "
That 's a distance of just a few miles , probably at speeds below 25 mph - so it still wo n't come close to showing us how close the Volt prototypes may be to finished products .
The fact that Wagoner did n't drive one from Detroit , but apparently had it shipped to Washington in order to drive the last few miles , may be an indication that the Volt program has a long was to go to keep its promises .
Wired , however , comments , " Rolling up to the hearing in a Volt clearly is a PR move , and a shameless one at that .
But we 're still glad to see the Volt appearing in public because the public needs to see it .
Not only is the Volt the most important car any of the Big Three automakers are working on right now , it is GM 's best shot at turning things around . "
While the bailout debate goes on , automakers are trying to sell cars as fast as possible with deep discounts .

Visitors said the park was nothing like the marketing on its website
In pictures
A newly - opened " winter wonderland " Lapland - style theme park has been described as a " joke " and a " scam " by hundreds of angry visitors .
Many people have demanded a refund of the £ 25 they paid to enter the Lapland New Forest , at Matchams Leisure Park on the Hampshire - Dorset border .
Several visitors have contacted the BBC saying the standard is extremely poor and does not resemble marketing photos .
Organiser Henry Mears said : " We do n't believe we ripped anyone off . "
He blamed " a few groups of professional troublemakers " for the allegations over the attraction which opened on Friday .
" Like all people they like to get into queues and just generate a bit of aggravation .
The two reindeer were obviously not enjoying their surroundings and the ' log cabins ' were a few green painted sheds
April Chantler
" What is not here that we have n't advertised ? " he added .
More than 250 people have joined three Facebook groups about the park , with many demanding refunds .
Some said they had contacted the RSPCA about the animals on site .
The park 's website , which became unavailable on Monday afternoon , had shown pictures of snowy scenes and icicles , and promised real log cabins , a nativity scene , husky dogs and other animals , as well as a " bustling " Christmas market .
It said : " We can assure you of an absolutely magical scene ... just look how real and cold the ' snow ' appears to be . "
But some visitors said that what they experienced was " disorganised chaos " and " hell " .
They have complained that , once inside the park , they had to pay more to use the attractions .
Many people said they were disappointed by the Chistmas market Some also said that the animals looked unhappy and the facilities , including a broken ice rink , were poor .
Amanda Goodenough , of Blandford , Dorset , told the BBC she paid £ 150 for tickets for her family .
The park was " a complete misrepresentation , leaving my children heartbroken , " she complained .
" The advertisement lends you to believe that this is a snow - covered Lapland village with Hollywood special effects and a bustling Christmas market with an ice rink .
" The website is totally misleading , including photographs which bear no relation to the reality which awaits you on entry . "
' Chained ' huskies April Chantler , of Dibden Purlieu , Hampshire , described the park as " hell " .
" The huskies were chained up in a pen howling , yapping and generally looking thin and unhappy .
" The two reindeer were obviously not enjoying their surroundings and the ' log cabins ' were a few green painted sheds with more or less nothing in them . "

Grace Tyrrell , of Fareham , Hampshire , said there were many health and safety issues and that the toilets were " full to the seat " leaving her six - year - old daughter " disgusted " .
" The entire day was a joke , and I know everyone else thought so , " she said .
" The nativity scene was a picture on a painted wall which was viewed from a distance and which had everyone we met laughing . "
Mr Mears , who organises the park 's marketing and advertising , added he was " bemused " by the complaints .
" Sadly , the first two days were very , very wet and cold and not the most pleasant . "
He said the ice rink was now open after " it had a problem " which was out of the park 's hands .
Mr Mears added he was going to speak to his boss to see " what we are going to do about it " , but could not promise anyone a refund .
Dorset County Council 's trading standards team said it would start an investigation after receiving more than 50 complaints .

Though progress is on the way toward and energy deal with China at the China - US Economic Dialog , with the changing administration , the stakes just got higher for China .
Grist reports that :
China is pursuing cleantech so aggressively that , were it not for the election of Obama , they would have been a lock to be the global leader in the clean energy production and export .

The Wall Street Journal contends that :
The transition in the U.S. government make it close to certain that the discussions wo n’t yield breakthrough agreements on issues such as currency reform .
U.S. President - elect Barack Obama has n’t said whether he will continue the semiannual Strategic Economic Dialogue , which was conceived by U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson .
But for Cleantech industries , it ’s all good !
I have been reading up on CouchDB , an interesting alternative to using relational databases for ( usually ) completely the wrong purpose .
After the last contract I have been working on and having to deal with the mess that led to I can really see the need for tools like this .
I always thought it was weird how you ended up having to do loads of queries per page viewed , how you are limited by SQL when doing anything more complex things and buggered when it came to storing trees or other structures .
With CouchDB queries are prepared in advance using proper programming languages and are called views , this lets you grab stuff with a lot more power .
It also offers much more flexibility with how you structure your data .
( You can have a query that ignores records that are n’t relevant for example . )
A free online book , friendly IRC channel and a great Lisp library are some of the bonuses to what already looks like a pretty good idea .
Another cool aspect of CouchDB is that it gives you your data in JSON form so you can skip the ‘ PHP Layer ’ and make a dynamic application with just HTML , JavaScript and CouchDB !
( View the source of that page to see ! )
I am going to write a couple of basic programs to get the hang of CouchDB soon , but before I started , I needed to get a few examples working .
It took me a while so to save you the bother here is the code :
( asdf:oos ' asdf:load-op :cl- couch ) ;
Setup the blog package ( defpackage : blog ( :use :asdf :asdf- install :cl :hunchentoot :cl- who :cl-couchdb-client ) ( : shadowing-import-from #:cl-couchdb-client #:url-encode :url - decode ) ) ( in - package : blog ) ; Connect to CouchDB ( open - server ) ; Create a database ( couch - request : put ( contacts ) ) ;
Add a few records ( couch - request : post ( contacts ) ' (( " Name " .
" Simon " ) ( " Skype " . " simon@skype.com " ) ) ) ( couch - request : post ( contacts ) ' (( " Name " .
" Hozay Jones " ) ( " Email " . " hozay@gmail.com " ) ( " Address " .
" 123 test st " ) ) ) ( couch - request : post ( contacts ) ' (( " Name " .
" Dave " ) ( " Website " .
" http://kzar.co.uk " ) ) ) ( couch - request : post ( contacts ) ' (( " Crap " . " Blah " ) ) ) ;
List the records ( couch - request : get ( contacts _all_docs ) ) ;
Now using futon create a view for the contacts database ;
Here is the map JavaScript function to use : ; function ( doc ) { ; if ( doc. Name ) { ; emit( doc.
Name , doc ) ; ; } ;} ; Call the design document contacts and the view by_name ;
Now we can use this view to see all the records with a Name ( couch - request : get ( contacts / _view/ contacts / by_name ) ) ;
And now any with the name Simon ( couch - request : get ( contacts / _view / contacts / by_name : key " \" Simon\ " " ) )
( I am brand new to this so I might have made some mistakes , it does give you somewhere to start from though . )
Any feedback would be great ,
Cheers , Dave .
I guess the good news then is that there is something in there that will appeal to everyone , regardless of your outlook .
The bad news ?
The claims that are directly opposed to your views will have you questioning the credibility of the report .
And if you are like me -- and note that between last year 's report and this year 's report they dropped their 2030 oil demand forecast by 10 million bpd -- you are left wondering whether there is any credibility at all in forecasts that far out .
This trend held in the section on renewable energy .
The optimist noted that renewable energy is expected to " expand rapidly . "
The pessimist noted that biofuels are predicted to only supply 5 % of our road transport fuel in 2030 .
And so the report goes , part rampant optimism and part rampant pessimism .
As I read through the 2008 International Energy Agency ( IEA ) World Energy Outlook , I had the distinct impression that I was reading contributions from people with completely opposite points of view .
The pessimist warned that we are facing a supply crunch and much higher prices .
The optimist in the report said that oil production wo n't peak before 2030 .
But for what 's worth , here 's what the IEA had to say about renewable energy .
Report Highlights
World energy demand is forecast to grow from 11,730 Mtoe ( million metric tons of oil equivalents ) in 2006 to 17,010 Mtoe in 2030 .
Fossil fuels , with oil as the primary source , will account for 80 % of energy used in 2030 .
China and India will be responsible for over half of the increased energy demand between now and 2030 .
Global demand for oil ( excluding biofuels ) is forecast to rise from 85 million bpd in 2007 to 106 million bpd in 2030 .
This forecast was revised downward by 10 million bpd since last year ’s forecast .
World demand for electricity is forecast to rise from 15,665 TWh in 2006 to 28,141 TWh in 2030 .
Renewable energy will displace gas to become the second largest producer of electrical energy by 2015 , but will still lag far behind coal .
For OECD countries , the increase in renewable electricity is greater than the increase in electricity from fossil fuels and nuclear .
The share of nuclear power in the world energy mix falls from 6 % in 2008 to 5 % in 2030 .
Electricity generation from PV and CSP in 2030 is forecast to be 245 TWh and 107 TWh , respectively .
Solar PV will continue to have the highest investment cost of all commercially deployed renewable energy sources .
Geothermal and wave technologies are forecast to produce 180 TWh and 14 TWh of electricity in 2030 .
Over 860
TWh of electricity from biomass is forecast to be produced in 2030 .
Present conversion of biomass to electricity is at 20 % efficiency .
Global output of wind power is forecast to grow from 130 TWh in 2006 to more than 660 TWh in 2015 to 1,490 TWh in 2030 .
It will become the 2nd largest source of renewable electricity ( after hydropower ) by 2010 .
Potential for hydropower in non-OECD countries is still large .
Most good sites in OECD countries have been utilized .
Energy storage is rarely the cheapest way of dealing with variability of wind and solar power , but several next generation storage technologies are under development .
These include ultracapacitors , superconducting magnetic systems , and vanadium redox batteries .
Electrolysis to produce hydrogen , later used in fuel cells on demand is an option , but the overall efficiency is only 40 % .
Carbon dioxide emissions from coal combustion are forecast to rise from 11.7 billion metric tons in 2006 to 18.6 billion metric tons in 2030 .
The ability of carbon sequestration to limit carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 is limited .
The reference scenario presumes that by 2030 , the U.S. will only meet 40 % of the biofuel mandate set in 2007 .
In Brazil , biofuels are projected to account for 28 % of road - transport fuel demand by 2030 .
The present amount supplied is equivalent to 13 % of road - transport fuel demand .
Demand for biodiesel is expected to grow faster than demand for ethanol .
Biofuels in 2006 provided the equivalent of 0.6 million bpd , representing around 1.5 % of global road transport fuel demand .
The United States is the largest user of biofuels , and most of the recent growth has been in the U.S .
The share of biofuels in road transport fuels is forecast to grow from 1.5 % in 2006 to 5 % ( 3.2 million bpd ) in 2030 .
Second generation biofuels based on lignocellulosic biomass , converted via enzyme hydrolysis or biomass gasification ( BTL ) are expected to become commercially viable .
However , the contribution will be minor , and not until after 2020 .
Capital costs for cellulosic ethanol are " significantly more " than sugarcane or grain - based facilities .
As a result , full commercialization hinges on " major cost reductions . "
The United States and Brazil both export soybean biodiesel to the EU .
( The fact that the U.S. exports any biodiesel is very surprising to me , given the high demand / prices for diesel in the U.S. )
Some countries are beginning to scale back their biofuel policies due to concerns about environmental sustainability .
Shortages of water availability will be a potential constraint for further expansion of biofuels .
Most biomass will still come from agricultural and forestry residues in 2030 , but a growing portion will come from biomass farmed for biofuels .
A growing share of biomass is also projected to fuel combined heat and power ( CHP ) plants .
There is considerable room for growth of solar water heating ( water heating consumes 20 % of all residential energy consumption ) .
China currently has 60 % of the world 's installed solar water heating capacity .
Solar water and space heating projected to grow from 7.6 Mtoe in 2006 to 45 Mtoe in 2030 .
Hybrid vehicles are commercially viable today ; electric vehicles have yet to gain traction .
Electric vehicle technology is advancing rapidly , but further improvements in storage technology are needed for efficiency and cost improvements .
Long term , electric hybrids , fully electric vehicles , and fuel cell vehicles have the most potential for minimizing the need for oil - based fuels .
In the very long term -- projecting out to 2050 - - fuel cell vehicles are forecast to make up 33 % to 50 % of new vehicle sales in the OECD .
Cumulative investment in renewable energy between 2007 and 2030 is projected to be $ 5.5 trillion , with 60 % of that for electricity generation .
Commentary
The report reiterates the points I have argued on numerous occasions : Biofuels will not scale up to produce more than a small fraction of our fuel demand , and even then with potentially serious consequences .
While the report spreads the blame for higher food prices on a combination of competition with biofuels , higher energy prices , poor harvests , and various agricultural policies , it correctly identifies water as a ( highly underrated ) issue in the future scaling of biofuels .
On the other hand , the report identifies Latin America and Africa as regions with the potential for boosting biomass production by modernizing farming techniques .
I think the report correctly identifies renewable electricity and renewable heating ( especially solar water heating ) as areas poised for growth .
However , it also predicts that carbon dioxide emissions will continue to rise .
This was a controversial issue I tackled earlier in the year , when I predicted " we wo n't collectively do anything that will reduce worldwide greenhouse gas emissions . "
I do n't think emissions are going to start falling substantially until nature does it for us .
The following figure was very interesting to me :
Source : 2008 IEA WEO
This figure suggests that by 2030 , the cost for solar PV and CSP will still be higher than all other renewable technologies are today .
And not just a little higher : solar PV is predicted to be twice as expensive in 2030 as hydro and onshore wind are today .
So much for Moore 's Law applying to solar PV .
However the nagging issue for me is the credibility of the predictions .
How much stock can I put into the renewable energy predictions from an agency that thinks oil production wo n't peak until 2030 , and that demand will exceed 100 million bpd ( contrary to the opinions of two Big Oil executives ) ?
Conclusions
The renewable energy portion was a tale of two technologies : Renewable electricity and renewable biofuels .
Renewable electricity is forecast to grow rapidly , and make up an increasing portion of electricity supplies .
The share of nuclear power falls , but coal usage is projected to rise 60 % by 2030 ( with 90 % of that increase in non-OECD countries ) .
The expected increase in coal usage helps explain why greenhouse gas emissions are forecast to continue rising .
Renewable biofuels , by contrast , are forecast to still make a very small contribution to overall road transport fuel by 2030 .
Cellulosic ethanol will be slow to be commercialized , and the contribution to fuel supplies by 2030 is expected to be small .
Concerns about negative externalities will grow , and the impact of biofuel production on water supplies will be hotly debated .
The well - known Black Hat SEO refers to an unethical strategy of search engine positioning .
The name comes from the cowboy movies in which the bad guy is represented with a black hat and the good guy with a white hat ( see White Hat SEO ) .
Due to the concept of “ unethical , ” the guidelines of search engines such as Google or Bing are ignored .
When creating links , spam practices are used , as in the case of external links that redirect different pages to Spanish homepages , and if these methods come to light , search engines exclude websites from being indexed .
Crawler
A crawler ( also known as a web spider or bot ) travels the global computer network ( WWW ) automatically looking for pages to analyze according to specific criteria .
The crawler operates independently and automatically repeats the tasks assigned to it .
Search engines like Google use crawlers to index content .
In this way , new web pages are included , those that no longer exist are deleted , and those still living are updated .
External link
The backlinks or external relationships are those that link some web pages with others and are important because they exert a positive influence on the positioning in the search engines .
An external link of a trustworthy website with a relevant theme ( in this respect Google sets a quality factor ) , it will make the search engines see it as a right reference page and , also , it will increase your Trust Rank .
The higher this algorithm , the higher the level of reliability with which Google will classify the links of a said web page .
The profile of links on a page ( number and quality of relationships ) is one of the most critical positioning factors for Google and other search engines , but also a crucial point in web positioning .
Internal link
The internal links refer to a subpage within a web page and are one of the most important instruments of web positioning .
In the first place , significant internal references have an added value for readers , since through them it is possible to access more information quickly .
Also , these links serve to optimize the structure of web pages and represent a quality criterion relevant to Google regarding the evaluation of the pages .
The Google crawler reads the internal structure of the web links and takes it into account when making the ranking .
The link juice , which is also transmitted through internal links , serves to improve the positioning of subpages and category pages .
Title tag
The “ title ” element establishes the title of a web page and is displayed both in the browser and in the search results list of Google .
Through it , the user can directly access the web page .
To obtain a good click index , it is important that it is formulated in a simple , precise and expressive way .
The “ title ” tag is one of the positioning factors in Google and will also be taken into account in the search engine positioning On Page .
Each URL will have a unique “ title , ” and ideally the keyword appears at the beginning of said “ title . ”
Getting the On - Page SEO of your website is very important that is why we let the pros at https://fudzology.com handle this to get it right .…

Well - known defense and homeland security analyst James Jay Carafano , PhD , has a solution to the pirate crisis : Lasers .
Which should come as no surprise .
Since the Heritage Foundation Senior Research Fellow thinks the answers to all kinds of security questions – from Russian mortars to Hezbollah missiles to jihadists ' bombs to pirates ' boats – lie in lasers and other so - called " directed energy weapons . "
In 2004 , for instance , Carafano suggested using " directed energy weapons to protect critical infrastructure . "
America's " power plants , transportation hubs , and telecommunications facilities [ are ] becoming increasingly vulnerable to precision missile attacks , " he warned .
The solution : " directed - energy weapons ( DEWs ) , which include lasers , microwaves , electromagnetic pulses , and high intensity radio frequency waves . "
The next year , Carafano declared lasers to be one of the " future of anti-terrorism technologies . "
Then , in 2006 , Carafano penned a " WebMemo " entitled , " Defanging Hezbollah : A Directed Energy Defense Could Help . "
Ray guns like the Tactical High Energy Laser , he suggested , would be ideal for blasting the terror group 's rockets .
" Congress should provide emergency supplemental funding to rush THEL into production , " he wrote .
Later that year , Carafano made similar arguments in several other papers .
In 2007 , he suggested that the Navy should rely on nuclear reactors , in part because they could supply energy for " new , power - intensive weapons systems like rail - guns and directed - energy weapons . "
This August , Carafano then declared that the " Russia - Georgia War Highlights Need for Directed - Energy Defenses , " too .
THEL and the like would be perfect for zapping the Russian mortars raining down on Georgia .
And now , Somalia .
In his latest WebMemo , " Pentagon Should Battle Pirates and Terrorists with Laser Technology , "
Carafano is disappointed that " the Pentagon is still reluctant to field these weapons because they cannot achieve the power and mobility the military thinks it needs for many battlefield missions . "
But fighting pirates do n't require high - powered lasers , like the THEL .
Less - potent lasers " would be effective for addressing a range of threats . "
The weapons " could , for example , disable the engines of small boats . "
Or they could " detonate shoulder - fired missiles before they strike their targets . "
Or they could " trigger IEDs [ improvised explosive devices ] from a safe distance before they threaten passing convoys , " Carafano offers .
Why , there 's practically nothing the ray guns can't do .

The Smokestack Effect : Toxic Air and America's Schools
What might be in the air outside your school ?
Search for a school to see the toxic chemicals that government data indicated were in the air outside .
School Name City / County Select a State Alabama Alaska Arizona Arkansas California Colorado Connecticut Delaware Florida Georgia Hawaii Idaho Illinois Indiana Iowa Kansas Kentucky Louisiana Maine Maryland Massachusetts Michigan Minnesota Mississippi Missouri Montana Nebraska Nevada New Hampshire New Jersey New Mexico New York North Carolina North Dakota Ohio Oklahoma Oregon Pennsylvania Puerto Rico Rhode Island South Carolina South Dakota Tennessee Texas Utah Vermont Virginia Washington Washington D.C.

The growl of air - monitoring equipment has replaced the chatter of children at Meredith Hitchens Elementary School in this Cincinnati suburb along the Ohio River .
School district officials pulled all students from Hitchens three years ago , after air samples outside the building showed high levels of chemicals coming from the plastics plant across the street .
The levels were so dangerous that the Ohio EPA concluded the risk of getting cancer there was 50 times higher than what the state considers acceptable .
' WEIRD ' SMELL : Odor sets off investigation at Ohio school BEST OR WORST :
Where does your school 's air quality rank ?
The air outside 435 other schools — from Maine to California — appears to be even worse , and the threats to the health of students at those locations may be even greater .
Using the government 's most up - to - date model for tracking toxic chemicals , USA TODAY spent eight months examining the impact of industrial pollution on the air outside schools across the nation .
The model is a computer simulation that predicts the path of toxic chemicals released by thousands of companies .
USA TODAY used it to identify schools in toxic hot spots — a task the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency had never undertaken .
The result : a ranking of 127,800 public , private and parochial schools based on the concentrations and health hazards of chemicals likely to be in the air outside .
The model 's most recent version used emissions reports filed by 20,000 industrial sites in 2005 , the year Hitchens closed .
The potential problems that emerged were widespread , insidious and largely unaddressed : • At Abraham Lincoln Elementary School in East Chicago , Ind. , the model indicated levels of manganese more than a dozen times higher than what the government considers safe .
The metal can cause mental and emotional problems after long exposures .
Three factories within blocks of the school — located in one of the most impoverished areas of the state — combined to release more than 6 tons of it in a single year .
" When you start talking about manganese , it does n't register with people in poverty , " says Juan Anaya , superintendent of the School City of East Chicago district .
" They have bigger issues to deal with . " •
The middle school in Follansbee , W.Va. , sits close to a cluster of plants that churn out tens of thousands of pounds of toxic gases and metals a year .
• In Huntington , W.Va. , data showed the air outside Highlawn Elementary School had high levels of nickel , which can harm lungs and cause cancer .
•
At San Jacinto Elementary School in Deer Park , Texas , data indicated carcinogens at levels even higher than the readings that prompted the shutdown of Hitchens .
A recent University of Texas study showed an " association " between an increased risk of childhood cancer and proximity to the Houston Ship Channel , about 2 miles from the school .
The 435 schools that ranked worst were n't confined to industrial centers .
Illinois , Ohio and Pennsylvania had the highest numbers , but the worst schools extended from the East Coast to the West , in 170 cities across 34 states , USA TODAY found .
IN DANGER ?
Toxics can affect kids , adults differently
In some school districts , emissions from the smokestacks of refineries or chemical plants threatened students of every age , preschool through prom .
Outside those schools , reports from polluters themselves often indicated a dozen different chemicals in the air .
All are considered toxic by the government , though few have been tested for their specific effects on children .
Scientists have long known that kids are particularly susceptible to the dangers .
They breathe more air in proportion to their weight than adults do , and their bodies are still developing .
Based on the time they spend at school , their exposures could last for years but the impact might not become clear for decades .
That was the case in Port Neches , Texas , where more than two dozen former students of Port Neches - Groves High School have been diagnosed with cancer several years after they graduated , according to court records .
So far , 17 have reached legal settlements with petrochemical plants located less than a mile from the school .
In court filings , the plants ' operators had denied they were to blame for the illnesses .
The U.S. EPA , which has a special office charged with protecting children 's health , has invested millions of taxpayer dollars in pollution models that could help identify schools where toxic chemicals saturate the air .
Even so , USA TODAY found , the agency has all but ignored examining whether the air is unsafe at the very locations where kids are required to gather .
If regulators had used their own pollution models to look for schools in toxic hot spots , they would have discovered what USA TODAY found : locations — in small towns such as Lucedale , Miss. , and Oro Grande , Calif. , as well as in large cities such as Houston — where the government 's own data indicated the air outside schools was more toxic than the air outside the shuttered Hitchens .
" Wow , " says Philip Landrigan , a physician who heads a unit at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York focused on children 's health and the environment .
" The mere fact that kids are being exposed ought to be enough to force people to pay attention .
The problem here is , by and large , there 's no cop on the beat .
Nobody 's paying attention . "

TV crews have descended on a house in Whittier , near Los Angeles A Californian woman who gave birth to octuplets earlier this week already has six children , US media have reported .
The eight babies were delivered nine weeks early by Caesarean section in a hospital near Los Angeles on Monday .
The mother has not been named , but US media are quoting family members as saying she already has six other children , including twins .
Doctors say the eight babies are making good progress and are expected to stay in hospital for several more weeks .
Although the babies ' mother asked doctors to keep her details confidential , a family acquaintance gave clues to her identity to the American CBS channel .
Shortly afterwards , media camped outside a house in Whittier , near Los Angeles .
' Sibling excitement '
The Associated Press news agency spoke to a man identified as the babies ' grandfather , who was with two children .
The children said they were excited to have eight new siblings , AP reported .
The Los Angeles Times later carried an interview with a woman identified as the babies ' grandmother , who said her daughter already had six young children and never expected the fertility treatment she had received would result in eight more babies .
A huge team was needed to deliver the babies successfully
She said that doctors had given her daughter the option of reducing the number of embryos , but she had declined .
" What do you suggest she should have done ?
She refused to have them killed .
That is a very painful thing , " she said .
She added that her daughter expected a big challenge raising 14 children .
The woman 's husband is expected to return to Iraq where he works as a contractor , the LA Times reported .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Officials at the Kaiser Permanente Medical Center , near Los Angeles , said the woman was already 12 weeks pregnant when she came to them .
Despite media questioning , the hospital has declined to say whether the mother became pregnant through fertility treatments .
The eight babies were delivered by a team of 46 doctors , nurses and assistants in the space of five minutes .
The mother is the second person recorded in the US to have delivered a set of living octuplets .
The last octuplets known to have survived birth in the US were born in Houston in 1998 .
One of the babies died one week later .

PSYOP against Milosevic ’s Yugoslavia
SGM Herbert A. Friedman ( Ret . )
The article is not a history of the Balkan conflict as confined to the old Yugoslavia .
It is a look at the PSYOP campaigns fought there in the past decade .
By definition , the historical content of this report is just a brief review and meant only to give the reader an idea of what was happening at the time that a specific leaflet , poster , or radio broadcast was disseminated in that war - torn country .
The United States found itself involved in the nation once called Yugoslavia several times in the past decade .
There was a violent disintegration of that country after the death of Joseph Broz ( Tito ) in 1980 .
In order to rule as dictator , Tito had divided the Serbian people , the largest ethnic group of Yugoslavia , into four " Socialist Federative Republics " and two Autonomous Regions .
Some 42 % of the Serbs were located outside Serbia Proper .
This system worked only as long as Tito was able to rule with an iron hand .
In 1989 , a new nationalist leader by the name of Slobodan Milosevic took power in the Serbian Republic .
He had previously served as the leader of Belgrade Communist Party and the Serbian Communist Party .
He wanted to dominate all of the old Yugoslavia , but when it became clear that he could not , he decided upon the ethnic cleansing of his country and the creation of a Greater Serbia .
He abolished Kosovo 's autonomy .
Croats and Slovenes feared that they were next in line .
There were daily news reports of murders , rapes , mass killings and other atrocities carried out by the Serbs as Milosevic drove the minorities from their lands and homes , " purifying " Serbia .
Croatia and Slovenia declared their independence from the Yugoslav Federated Republic .
In Croatia , ethnic Serbs and Croats begin a long , bloody conflict .
Serb snipers fired on peaceful demonstrators in Sarajevo , marking the beginning of the war .
The West recognized Bosnia - Herzegovina as an independent state .
Serbs killed 16 people waiting in line for bread in Sarajevo .
The UN imposed sanctions on Yugoslavia .
There were new reports of " ethnic cleansing , " a policy of slaughtering Muslim inhabitants of towns or driving them away in order to create an ethnically pure region .
There were reports of concentration camps and mass rapes .
Milosevic 's actions forced the United Nations to deploy peacekeeping forces and begin humanitarian relief operations .
Operation Provide Promise began on 2 July 1992 .
Twenty - one nations formed a coalition to resupply war - torn Sarajevo with food and medicine .
The U.N. established " no- fly " zones over Bosnia .
The United States mediated an agreement between the Bosnians , the Bosnian Croats , and the Government of Croatia to form a federation of Bosnians and Croats .
This ended the fighting between these factions .
The Bosnian Serbs remained belligerent and fired on coalition aircraft .
They shot down an Italian transport killing the crew .
When it became too dangerous to land at Sarajevo Airport , the cargo planes airdropped supplies .
Two leaflets were prepared and dropped over Bosnia .
They both depict a Hercules C - 130 USAF cargo plane in front of a faint United States flag .
Both leaflets picture crates falling by parachute marked with a bright red cross , and both are written in Serbo - Croat text , in Latin script on one side and Cyrillic on the other side .
On the first leaflet , the C - 130 drops four containers .
The leaflet tells the Serbs not to fire on the aircraft .
They drop food for all the people .
The text is : American aircraft will be dropping humanitarian aid for all people .
Do not fire on American aircraft .
Food and medical supplies are intended for all people .
On the second leaflet , the C - 130 drops three containers labeled " 500 KG . "
This leaflet was prepared because of accidents that occurred in Somalia .
Starving people rushed mindlessly into the drop zone only to be crushed by falling food crates .
The leaflet text is : Danger !
For everyone 's safety , let humanitarian aid land before approaching .
Before this first leaflet drop the U.S. Army 's 6th PSYOP Battalion had many alerts , false starts and partial deployments while the great powers decided if the action would be solely by the United States , under the auspices of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization , or the United Nations .
As a result , these first leaflets were designed in three different formats in Germany .
Eventually it was decided that this would be a NATO operation , but the decision was already made that the first leaflets would display the American flag .
The images were faxed via a secure link back to Ft. Bragg for printing by the Product Dissemination Battalion .
When the leaflets were delivered shortly before the first drop they were found to be poorly printed with a " grainy " appearance .
The PSYOP troops were very disappointed with the quality but it was too late to make any changes or reprint the entire stock of leaflets .
There were numerous published reports of the aerial leafleting .
On 25 February 1993 , U.S. aircraft dropped about 600,000 leaflets over Srebrenica , Cerska , Gorazde , and Zera .
On 27 February , two C- 130s dropped another million leaflets .
Five C-130s dropped 80 1 - ton food containers on 28 February .
Aircraft dropped another one million leaflets on 1 March .
Two other leaflets were not disseminated .
They bear the United Nations seal in the background .
The UN leaflets are actually a better product with a clearer sharper appearance .
The text is identical , except that in the first leaflet the word " American " is deleted concerning the origin of the aircraft .
Three U.S. C-130s conducted the first night airdrops over Bosnia , releasing 16 tons of Meals , Ready to Eat ( MREs ) on 28 Feb 93 .
By the end of the operation , aircraft from 21 countries had flown 12,886 sorties into Sarajevo , delivering 159,622 tons of food , medicine , and supplies and evacuating over 1,300 wounded people .
Operation Allied Harbor was NATO 's first humanitarian operation .
In the case of the Kosovo crisis , by the end of March 1999 the normal civilian non-governmental agencies were unable to cope with the massive influx of refugees into Albania .
By 15 June 1999 there were 479,223 refugees in the country .
The round sticker above was used to identify non-military NATO and humanitarian relief vehicles so they would get less interference from the local populace while carrying out day - to - day tasks .
It was also a quick means of vehicle ID for gate guards at Tirana airfield .
The Product Development Detachment of B Company of the 9th Psychological Operations Battalion printed about 7 million leaflets on four Risograph presses in the early days of the operation .
The bumper sticker above was attached to all U.S. relief supply cartons and cases .
Although SHINING HOPE was a NATO venture , the U.S. senior officers wanted to ensure that relief supplies from the U.S. were clearly identified .
Joint Task Force ( JTF ) Shining Hope was the United States contribution to Operation Allied Harbor .
The mission was to conduct foreign humanitarian assistance operations in support of US government and non-governmental agencies and international organizations engaged in providing humanitarian relief to Kosovo refugees in Albania and the Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia .
The Humanitarian Service Medal was authorized for U.S. military personnel who took part in the operation from 3 April 1999 to 5 June 1999 .
Master Sergeant ( retired ) Rod Schmidt of the 9th Psychological Operations Battalion adds : I wish I had a copy of a television commercial my guys ( Rick Eller and Rob Hart ) designed .
It was a non-interference commercial which asked the Albanian populace for their assistance in helping the Kosovar refugees by clearing roads for relief vehicles , etc .
It was very high quality and was broadcast on three separate Albanian television networks on a rotating and reducing cycle .
The first day it was broadcast , we had reports from the military police and relief organizations that Albanians were actually pulling off of the road to let them pass .
The Serbs continued to act aggressively toward their neighbors .
This forced NATO to undertake an intensive , month - long bombing campaign in August 1995 .
These air strikes produced the desired effect .
A cease - fire went into effect in October , and peace talks began on 1 November 1995 .
These negotiations produced the framework for peace known as the Dayton Peace Accords .
Operation Provide Promise continued until 9 January 1996 .
On that date , the last USAF C - 130 brought relief supplies into Sarajevo Airport and ended the longest humanitarian airlift in history .
US Servicemen came to Bosnia in December 1995 as part of the Implementation Force ( IFOR ) , the NATO - led peacekeeping force in Bosnia created under the Dayton accords .
Their mission was to enforce the agreement ending the Bosnian war .
The mission in Bosnia represented the alliance 's first major involvement in operational peacekeeping .
IFOR had a one - year mandate to oversee implementation of the military aspects of the peace agreement .
They achieved those goals by June 1996 .
The PSYOP Campaign is mentioned in the report , Target Bosnia : Integrating Information Activities in Peace Support Operations - NATO - led Operations in Bosnia - Herzegovina .
Following the signing of the Bosnian Peace Agreement on 14 December 1995 , which put an end to a four - year long war in Bosnia - Herzegovina , the UN mandated NATO to oversee and enforce a durable cease - fire between the former belligerents .
On 20 December 1995 , a NATO - led multinational force , called the Implementation Force ( IFOR ) started OPERATION JOINT ENDEAVOUR .
On 20 December 1996 , a smaller NATO coalition called the Stabilization Force ( SFOR ) replaced IFOR .
In operation JOINT GUARD , SFOR received an eighteen month mandate to oversee and enforce the cease - fire .
In Bosnia , IFOR and then SFOR ran an information campaign designed to " seize and maintain the initiative by imparting timely and effective information within the commander 's intent . "
The term information campaign refers to the coordinated and synchronized use of different information activities within the command .
The campaign had three components .
A public information ( PI ) campaign designed to establish NATO 's credibility with the international media to gain support from the contributing nations for the mission .
Public Information Officers executed this mission .
A psychological operations ( PSYOP ) campaign designed to influence the local population and its leaders in favor of IFOR troops and operations .
PSYOP units ( mainly American ) undertook this aspect of the campaign .
A Civil - Military Cooperation ( CIMIC ) information campaign designed to inform audiences about civil - military cooperation and to release information to aid the local populations .
CIMIC elements ( mainly U.S. Army ) undertook this mission .
A number of leaflets were prepared and distributed during this phase of the forced peace .
IFOR had a radio station in Tuzla that played music , news and sports for the people .
The Allies produced a standard radio leaflet that showed a radio antenna at the left and identified the station as : Radio IFOR - Tuzla - Rock of the Balkans - 1017 kHz .
The number and location of the IFOR / SFOR radio stations varied throughout the operations .
Originally , IFOR set up five radio stations located in the five most populated cities across the country : Sarajevo , Tuzla , Banja - Luka , Mrkonjic Grad , and Mostar ( struck down by a lightning on 14 September 1996 ) .
During the first six months of SFOR operations , the Combined Joint Information Campaign Task Force operated three radio stations in Sarajevo ( Radio Mir ) , Brcko , and Coralici .
In the fall 1997 , the French agreed to man and operate a new station in Mostar .
These radio stations operated at least 18 hours a day with music , news bulletins and messages .
Programming on Radio Mir consisted of : Current news five times a day ; " Classic " rock and roll , " Top 40 ' hits , Rhythm and Blues , " Eurohits , " and local area music ; Interviews with SFOR commanders and the Office of the High Representative ; and Broadcast talk shows with guest radio station personalities from local stations .
Major John Mills discusses " PSYOP : Radio Operations in Bosnia , " in Special Warfare , fall 2001 .
He notes that from January 1997 to August 1997 , elements of the United States Army Reserve 's 11th Psychological Operations Battalion and personnel attached from other USAR PSYOP battalions deployed to Bosnia - Herzegovina .
He says in part : After brainstorming numerous concepts , we hit on the solution - radio .
Our radio- production capability was limited .
Radio Mir in Sarajevo was producing various types of music tapes that contained intermittent soft - sell , radio - announcer voice - overs .
We decided to use radio to broadcast translations of open - source information from existing international news media ( Reuters , the Associated Press and United Press International ) to supplement the information products produced by the headquarters of the Combined Joint Task Force .
We needed a dedicated broadcast booth and professional - quality equipment .
The answer was an MSQ - 85B shelter .
The MSQ - 85B mobile audiovisual shelter was at the time one of the primary systems of the PSYOP community .
This HMMWV - mounted shelter was fielded during the 1980s .
The shelter provided a complete capability for recording , editing and reproducing audio and video products .
Had it been equipped with an FM transmitter , it would have been a complete broadcast studio .
Our major objective was to put out a message that would forcefully explain the SFOR 's right , under international law and under the DPA , to seize indicted war criminals .
We translated press releases from the Coalition Press Information Center , or CPIC , in an attempt to counter the tirade of messages being broadcast in Serbian controlled areas .
Each week , at Radio Tuzla , we produced and broadcast a 30 - minute show that came to be titled " The Week in SFOR . "
From January to August 1997 , the information campaign in Bosnia used local radio to communicate the SFOR message to the formerly warring factions .
While it was difficult to precisely measure the program 's effectiveness , the success of the combined efforts of the SFOR was reflected by a lack of active hostilities .
The radio program laid the groundwork for establishing long - lasting relationships with the local radio-station managers and personnel - some of the people who controlled what was being communicated in Bosnia .
U.S. Army Reserve Major Thomas Bergman is a member of the 18th PSYOP Company , 10th PSYOP Battalion , 7th PSYOP Group .
He was activated in December of 1995 for a tour in Bosnia .
He had three Tactical PSYOP Teams , two in support of the two Military Police battalions supporting Tuzla and Lukavac and one attached to the NORDPOL Brigade ( the Nordic countries , the Baltics , Poland and the United States ) in Doboj .
His unit provided the first U.S. Army Reserve PSYOP soldiers in Bosnia reporting to the 4th POG .
In regard to the radio comments above he says : Concerning IFOR radio broadcasts , the information attributed to Major John Mills first utilizing civilian radio and conducting a weekly show is incorrect .
I realized that the canned IFOR taped music and messages were inadequate from the start .
By the time the tapes reached the remote transmitters from Sarajevo , the news was outdated .
I requested funding to buy air time on local radio stations but was denied .
I approached several Tuzla radio stations and pitched the idea of a weekly hourly call - in talk show where we could give out current news and answer questions from the populace .
Radio Tuzla agreed and in early spring 1996 I began conducting a weekly show with the aid of my interpreter .
In regard to how PSYOP performed in 1995 he says :
All in all , as far as product design , dissemination and propaganda support of our supported units , PSYOP failed miserably .
We were ill - prepared for a mission which involved more than kicking radios and surrender leaflets out of airplanes especially when we were competing with superior forms of existing local media .
On the positive side he adds :
One of my teams was temporarily attached to the Russian Brigade in the Republika of Serpska to provide loudspeaker support during some tense attempted border crossings by displaced civilians wishing to return to visit their homes , cemeteries , etc .
My team was housed and fed by the Russians for almost a week and that may have been the first time that a U.S. PSYOP element directly supported a Russian unit .
As of March 1997 , IFOR / SFOR had produced 51 television spots to be given to local stations throughout theater .
More than 3 million posters and handbills were disseminated throughout theater between December 1995 and November 1997 .
The Task Force Eagle Information Operations Newsletter of January 1999 mentions some specific leaflet operations during 1997 .
Some of them are : Leaflets were distributed from helicopters over key cities and towns in the American - led peace enforcement zone in northeastern Bosnia and adjoining areas .
About 43,000 leaflets were distributed from the air and by soldiers on the ground .
The leaflets presented information about democracy and responsible government , quoting democratic thinkers including such icons as Thomas Jefferson , John Locke , Plato and others .
On 16 October 1997 , Task Force Eagle delivered by air , over the city of Brcko , leaflets which urged the inhabitants not to vote for Karadzic and his supporters .
Later that month , U.S. helicopters dropped leaflets on the city of Bijeljina in preparation for the November municipal elections .
These leaflets supported the Plavsic regime in Banja Luka .
The IFOR Coalition Joint Information Campaign Task Force ( CJICTF ) , supporting the peace operation in Bosnia , arguably produced more diverse printed products than any other mission to date .
They produced newspapers , newspaper articles , handbills , posters , magazines , comic - books , and flyers for both the military and civilian implementers of the Dayton Peace Agreement .
The primary mission of IFOR and SFOR Psychological Operations was to deter armed resistance and hostile behavior against IFOR / SFOR troops and operations The Allies also produced mine - warning leaflets .
One depicts seven different explosive devices and has a bright red triangle with the word " Danger . "
Another shows a child ’s foot about to step on a mine or a child about to touch a half - buried mine .
This 1996 IFOR Bosnia mine awareness leaflet depicts various types of landmines and says : Mines kill !
Do n't touch them .
As in almost every war the United States fights , mine awareness cards are prepared to protect the troops .
They are usually given away as training aides to any member who requests them from Supply .
These cards are restricted to U.S. military personnel to protect technical or operational information and are to be destroyed when no longer needed so that the enemy cannot see them .
There are 52 cards in this deck : 1 glossary , 1 mine awareness brief , 1 fuse characteristics , 1 fuse types , 19 antipersonnel mines , 10 antitank mines , 8 booby traps , 10 fuses and 1 mine system .
The anti-personnel card above shows a mine of the type the United States calls a “ Claymore . ”
There were many other propaganda publications used in Bosnia .
Perhaps the most interesting is the mine - warning 12 - page Superman comic book entitled " Deadly Legacy " that was produced pro-bono with DC Comics .
The cover shows the man of steel swooping down to save a two young boys who are about to pick up an explosive device on the ground .
The back of the book shows Superman flying the children to safety and the text : Superman has come to help the children of Bosnia - Herzegovina !
But even when he can't be here , you can keep yourself safe from land mines !
Mines kill kids !
For more information on how you can prevent these accidents , call the mine action center .
IFOR distributed over 1 million of the magazines in their first year in Bosnia .
Lieutenant Colonel Nick Swayne was the liaison with DC Comics in New York City tasked with the mine - awareness project that had the blessing and backing of then First Lady Hilary Clinton .
The military paid for the materials , ink and transportation , but not the art or concept work .
It supplied the photographs of Bosnians , local homes , landscape and backgrounds and the comic book artists did the rest .
The French were not enamored with the comic book , apparently disturbed that Superman represented " Truth , Justice and the American Way . "
Superman was very popular among the youth of Bosnia , but was the subject of consternation among certain allies .
Philip M. Taylor criticized the Superman Comic book in Munitions of the Mind : A History of Propaganda from the Ancient World to the Present Day , Manchester University Press , UK , 2003 .
I find it hard to accept his premise but he claims :
A classic example of how such well - intentioned propaganda can backfire , this comic had to be withdrawn when it was discovered that some young children were deliberately walking into minefields in the hope that Superman would come and save them .
This comment is rejected by Major Jeffrey
White who told me that it was never withdrawn from circulation , and definitely not as Phil Taylor suggests , based on the rationale that he cited .
Major
White never saw any comic books returned to Sarajevo .
He did feel that there was a significant undercurrent of anti-American sentiment among the NATO Forces , but the criticisms did not bear out in any of the post - testing in Bosnia .
There was never even one incident where it was reported that a child went into a known minefield hoping to be rescued by Superman , nor were there any other incidents provoked by the comic book .
LTC
Swayne states that he recalls two minor negative reactions to the comic book .
The first occurred when he coordinated with the United Nations Mine Action Center in Sarajevo prior to putting their phone number on the back cover of the comic book and matching poster .
They were not prepared for the number of calls that flooded their office .
Overnight their office went from a " Sleepy Hollow " to a place where the phone never stopped ringing .
The second was something that did not come out in pre or post - testing among the 10 to 15 - year - old target audience .
It was brought up by the International Press Corps at the unveiling of the comic book in the Sarajevo Holiday Inn .
They posed questions about the sexist nature of the comic in that the girl was always the subordinate character .
The comic was made for an audience and culture where that is the case whether we like it or not .
As a result , although it was an overwhelming success among the target audience , it was scrutinized by the international press because it did not depict an unrealistic dominant role for the female characters .
Sergeant Mark Jenkins of the 6th PSYOP Battalion was not very enthused about the comics .
He was a stickler for details , planning and Intelligence studies and the comics just appeared one day with the order to disseminate them .
He told me : I disagreed with them on principle , i.e. , that they were pushed on us from outside and had not gone through our campaign planning process , nor were they coordinated with any of our existing mine - awareness efforts .
So my reaction , as I recall , was , " Whatever , " and I hoped they might do some good .
But I was definitely worried it was further evidence of our pre-packaged " ready - fire - aim " approach to it all .
Another leaflet is in the form of a Federal Republic of Yugoslavia Narodna Banka Jugoslavije 20 Novih Dinara banknote of 1994 .
The front left of the leaflet looks like the banknote , the front right is all text :
In Business ...
More customers equal more sales and suppliers and more competition equals lower cost for consumers .
How can you influence this market ?
Encourage FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT .
It makes economic sense .
The back of the note depicts a small vehicle and a map .
The text is : FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT .
Everyone wins .
The leaflet encourages all of the various ethnic mixes of the area to open the borders for free trade with each other .
By December 1996 with the transition from IFOR to SFOR , the PSYOP task force organization somewhat changed .
The headquarters and Product Development Cell ( PDC ) became multinational instead of all - U.S. with French and British liaison officers assigned to the Combined Joint Information Task Force headquarters .
The British - led division acquired some printing equipment in spring 1996 to develop products specific to its area of responsibility .
Chef de Bataillon , M. E. Limon discusses the British and French effort in a Joint Services Command and Staff College Defense Research Paper : The British deployed up to 14 members of their 15th PSYOP Group to support the US led NATO PSYOP or IFOR Information Campaign .
The IFOR Information Campaign was conducted by the Combined Joint IFOR Information Campaign Task Force headed by a US full colonel .
The British were represented at divisional level , at theatre level , and at the Multinational Coordination Cell which dealt with strategic issues and was involved with the " Herald of Peace , " the theatre - level Information Campaign newspaper .
In mid-March 1996 , the British troops achieved the capability to produce their own printed products .
By late March 1996 , the British Divisional PSYOP element had print , reproduction , audio / radio , video and other imagery capabilities and three Land Rovers and trailers .
By spring 1996 , IFOR had established a strong link with the independent radio station in Banja Luka , ( " Radio Big " ) .
Personnel from IFOR appeared on a weekly show that combined music , conversation and questions from a live audience to deny any rumors and misconceptions and to promote a greater understanding of IFOR 's role .
Speaking of March 1996 , the last suburb of Sarajevo , a neighborhood called Grbavica , was officially turned over to the Muslim - Croat Federation effectively ending any possibility that the city would be surrounded and attacked by the Serbs in the future .
Grbavica was the fifth and final suburb to be transferred to the federation under the terms of the Dayton peace agreement .
Bosnian officials replaced Serb street signs , spoke of the final unification of the city , or trotted about in processions with Bosnian flags .
Over a thousand Serbs remained in the city , and the above leaflet reassures them and others who left earlier that is they have committed no crimes , they are welcome .
The text is : The Supreme Command of the Army of Bosnia - Herzegovina Grbavica is liberated .
Honest Serbs , who do not have blood on their hands , can return to the liberated territory .
Steven Collins goes into greater detail in " Army PSYOP in Bosnia : Capabilities and Constraints " in Parameters , summer 1999 .
By contrast , in the Multinational Division Southwest area , controlled by the United Kingdom , the importance of PSYOP was recognized early .
The UK military , drawing upon its extensive experience in Northern Ireland as well as its intimate familiarity with the region as part of the UN Protection Force , knew the critical importance of the battle for Bosnian " hearts and minds . "
Thus they requested deployment of US tactical PSYOP soldiers and radio broadcast equipment .
However , as with the French - led division , dissatisfaction with slow product support and a desire to control its own product development processes led the UK to field its own PSYOP element at its headquarters in Banja Luka .
This element continued to disseminate some products made by the PSYOP Task Force headquarters in Sarajevo , but the emphasis in the region was centered on its own PSYOP magazine , handbills , and other materials produced in Banja Luka .
Once again , oversight from Sarajevo was limited .
British Corporal Rob Walker was an Adjutant General Corps clerk in the Banja Luka " Metal Factory . "
This had been an actual factory but was taken over by the Multinational Task Force Northwest as a base for the Bosnia and Herzegovina stabilization force EUFOR ( formerly SFOR ) .
Rob worked in Information Operations ( Info Ops ) as their clerk and soon helped with printing leaflets in the Info Ops rooms .
The team was made up of various British Officers , both Active and Reserve , illustrators and some officers and senior noncommissioned officers from the U.S. Army .
Later , Walker was assigned the task of writing horoscopes for the free Mostovi ( Bridge ) newspaper .
The Mostovi staff was made up of Brits and Americans and the layout was done by a Royal Marine Illustrator .
35,000 copies of this 12 - page publication were regularly distributed .
Limon continues :
In 1994 , French forces were unable to conduct PSYOP .
There were no PSYOP specialists to advise the commanders in the field , and no printing facilities to communicate with the local population or factions .
PSYOP campaigns were limited to what can be called Civil Affairs .
In 1995 an attempt was made to define " Operational Communications " within a frame of Civil - Military Affairs .
Later , a service paper refined this concept by stating that Operational Communications aim at legitimate military intervention by explaining the objectives and roles of the forces to the local population and warring factions , and countering hostile propaganda activities directed towards friendly troops and the civil population .
Steven Collins adds : Multinational Division Southeast , under the control of the French , originally kept PSYOP at arm 's length .
The French reluctance to incorporate PSYOP into their plans was largely a legacy of their remembrance of French PSYOP 's dubious role in the war in Algeria in the late 1950s and early 1960s and participation in the attempted coup against Charles de Gaulle in 1961 .
The French also seemed to mistrust the motives of the US PSYOP personnel , who dominated the early effort in Bosnia .
Over time , the French began to accept increased US PSYOP support , including a PSYOP radio station in Mostar and a small group of US tactical PSYOP soldiers who disseminated materials .
The French frustration with the Byzantine nature of the US / NATO PSYOP product approval process contributed to their desire to develop their own capability in order to influence the PSYOP context more directly .
This led to the establishment of a French - run PSYOP radio station and creation of a French / Spanish / German PSYOP print product development capability in Mostar , all with virtually no oversight from the PSYOP Task Force headquarters in Sarajevo .
Apparently the French did trust the Belgians .
Belgium has a small PSYOP Support Element ( PSE ) unit called the Information Operations Group ( Info Ops Grp ) consisting of about 30 regular military personnel and selected reservists as needed .
After the loss of ten Belgian paratroopers in Rwanda in 1994 , apparently stirred up by the racist propaganda radio station Radio Télévision Libre des Mille Collines ( " Land of a Thousand Hills Free Radio and Television " ) , the Belgians realized the need for a PSYOP unit of their own .
Their first operation was in late 1999 in Kosovo where they installed a PSYOP radio station called " Radio Horizon " in the Belgian camp called " Center City " in the French - occupied section of Kosovo in Leposavic .
Even the name used for the campaign became an issue .
Target Bosnia states that some members of the North Atlantic Council did not want to be associated with a " psychological operations campaign . "
Changing the name to " IFOR Information Campaign " seemed to ease these fears .
However , there is little doubt that the " information campaign " was a psychological operations campaign .
It was conducted by PSYOP forces and according to NATO 's draft peace support psychological activities doctrine .
The Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe PSYOP staff officer stated that " I could not use the term ' psychological operations ' when I first briefed at North Atlantic Treaty Office Headquarters because that would have upset some nations . "
An unnamed author discussed the United Kingdom PSYOP operation in Kosovo in an untitled British Joint Services Command and Staff College abstract : Approximately 104.5 million leaflets were dropped by the coalition , primarily by the US , but despite the 78 - day bombing campaign the Serbian Army withdrew largely intact .
One commentator lamented that NATO 's PSYOP efforts were belated and perceived as threatening as well as being effectively countered by the Serbs who were able to demonstrate that modern high - tech precision weapons could be deceived using simple camouflage and concealment techniques .
Reflecting on this in a House of Commons Select Committee , Air Vice - Marshal Mike Heath stated : " There was no U.K. information campaign during the Kosovo crisis .
When we came out of it and we had firmly come second , we realized that this was something we needed to do pretty quickly . "
The campaign in Kosovo marked the inception of the Directorate of Targeting and Information Operations ( DTIO ) and the beginning of PSYOP integration into the wider Information Operations ( INFO OPS ) strategy in Kosovo .
However , Kosovo also highlighted a " weakness " in capability as the adversary demonstrated a clear awareness of the importance of Information Operations and were able to counter NATO PSYOP very effectively .
The French , German , Italian , and Spanish contingents all conducted PSYOP activities in support of their missions .
The Italian contingent developed a comic strip featuring Bugs Bunny to raise children 's awareness of mines .
There was little coordination between these efforts .
Additional themes were added to the list of PSYOP priorities .
The CJICTF was tasked with promoting democratic action , adherence to the rule of law , acceptance of returnees , and the ability of SFOR to enforce a secure environment in an even - handed manner .
There were also a number of magazines and newspapers published by the Allied forces .
U.S. forces in Sarajevo published a weekly news magazine called Herald of Peace .
The paper , each edition of which numbered 150,000 copies , was initially published in Stuttgart , Germany , later in Zagreb , Croatia , and finally in Sarajevo .
My good friend retired Lieutenant Colonel Karl Zetmeir was the publisher of the Herald of Peace for a short time .
He told me about his experience with the magazine :
One of the most professionally satisfying psychological operations products I ever worked on was the Herald of Peace .
Though a relatively short - lived product , it represented the hard work and true dedication to our craft on the part of its PSYOP soldiers as no other .
In a leaflet - dominated world often marked by simple illustrations and hip - shoot phraseology , the Herald of Peace stands in a class of its own .
We simply called it " the HoP . "
It was a magazine produced by the Combined Joint Information Task Force ( CJICTF ) in Sarajevo , Bosnia from 1996 through 1997 .
I myself reported to the CJICTF in June 1997 , where I worked for the Product Development Chief , Major Roger Smith , as the Officer in Charge for all print product development , which included being Chief Editor of the HoP , as well as the Budget / Finance ( BUDFIN ) officer for our overall PSYOP campaign efforts .
The officer I was replacing in both those functions was Captain Roger Lintz .
Roger 's drive and initiative had raised the bar from the HoP 's initial format to that of a glossy , four - color , 36 - page , TIME - quality magazine .
He 'd also negotiated a robust print contract with a Zagreb - based company that made this quality leap possible .
Our transition from his team to mine was seamless and we eagerly accepted this challenging job .
The operational direction of the HoP came from our boss Roger Smith .
Roger insisted the magazine hold true to stories that supported the Stabilization Force 's country - wide objectives , and we focused on themes like freedom of movement , election participation , and other peace initiatives .
The major stories covered subjects like the recently restored Sarajevo ambulance service or the purchase of new firefighting equipment .
We deliberately steered clear of ' collage ' photos of US or other nation 's military forces conducting peacekeeping operations , unit rotations , changes of command , etc .
One Stabilization Force logo was found on the inside cover , along with letters from the chief editor ( Roger Lintz , followed by myself ) and our Noncommissioned Officer editor ( Bob Kellogg followed by Hans - Marc Hurd ) in each issue .
In retrospect , we were going for the same appeal as that of a " Readers Digest , " that even older copies would be interesting and fresh to a war - devastated target audience , particularly in the hinterlands , that rarely saw any printed media at all .
In addition to its varied stories , the HoP had its own unique political satire cartoon .
The Balkan - renown and award winning cartoon artist , Hasan Faslic was contracted to write for us and he created " Mujo , Grujo and Lujo , " representing a Serb , Croatian and a Bosnian .
These three characters reduced very controversial political issues into simple and humorous cartoon illustrations .
Also hired were two other host - nation illustrators who created crossword puzzles and horoscopes for each issue .
We published 250,000 copies of the Herald of Peace each month .
Following lessons learned in disseminating the first few editions , we printed articles in both Latin and Cyrillic alphabets in a page - alternating style that prevented the magazine from being torn in two by the recipient just to keep the portion in " their " preferred alphabet .
Horoscopes enjoyed wide popularity among all three entities and we deliberately placed this on the back cover , so serve as the ' hook ' to generate interest .
Many times we 'd disseminate copies to people on the street to watch them start reading the horoscope , then take out a pen and begin working the crosswords .
As we 'd return to our vehicle a half hour later , we 'd see those same folks now thumbing through the rest of the articles .
The arrival of a new printing was always met with great excitement and anticipation within both the Combined Joint Information Task Force and Stabilization Force headquarters .
Bundles of the magazine would then be divided between our allies and disseminated across Bosnia - Herzegovina .
I was Chief Editor for two monthly editions of the Herald of Peace before production was abruptly stopped in August of 1997 .
That month the Combined Joint Information Task Force was inspected by a PSYOP Assessment Team ( POAT ) headed by the then 4th Psychological Operations Group Commander and a small staff .
Suffice it to say our vision of a PSYOP publication did n't match theirs .
Among other things , they wanted a portion of the issues printed in English for the Stabilization Force HQs staff , coverage of SFOR units included , broadened from what they thought was a Sarajevo - centric focus , and most importantly , they wanted the HoP printed every two weeks so the articles would be more current .
As the Budget / Finance officer who paid the bills for all the PSYOP products we made in each media , I knew these conditions far exceeded our contracted print agreement .
Production of the Herald of Peace thus came to a sudden and disappointing end .
We continued to publish " Mujo , Grujo and Lujo " as independent cartoons in various Bosnian newspapers .
However , in a particularly satisfying victory that Fall , the same Combined Joint Information Task Force print contract that had once produced 250,000 copies of the Herald of Peace across BiH was used to mass - print voter registration cards in the nick of time to ensure that the first nation - wide democratic elections in Bosnia could take place .
Ours was the only unit capable of accomplishing this feat .
Under SFOR this became the Herald of Progress with a circulation of about 100,000 by 1997 .
The Herald of Progress was a dramatic departure from former , traditional PSYOP print journalistic endeavors .
It was a " Madison Avenue - quality " monthly journal with pertinent articles , color photos , and political cartoons and commentaries .
It was published in both the Latin and Cyrillic alphabet .
Sergeant Mark Jenkens of the 6th PSYOP Battalion tells us more about the Herald of Peace , some of these facts from his After Action Report prepared 11 June 1996 .
Production work for the Herald of Peace in Zagreb began the week of 25 December 1995 .
The first Zagreb issue was laid out on 28 December 1995 and printed at Radin Press over the weekend .
Dissemination began in Bosnia and Herzegovina on 4 January 1996 .
Approved articles were received early in the week ( usually Tuesday ) , translations were completed by Wednesday evening , Disk files were prepared and forwarded to EuropaPress on Thursday , printing over the weekend , quality control check on Monday , delivered and placed on pallets on Tuesday , shipped to Bosnia on Wednesday .
After production in Zagreb ceased with issue 21 , remaining personnel in Zagreb deployed forward to Sarajevo on 22 May 1996 .
The approval process proved to be slow and unwieldy ; placing extreme time pressure on the translation section to meet weekly deadlines .
Jenkens also mentions problems that were not in his AAR .
For instance :
There were meaningless bureaucratic change requests .
One time we were told to change the word " happy " to " glad , " even though it translates to the same word in the foreign language .
Naples was annoyed that some of the broadsides we printed said " We will react to enemy actions against our convoys . "
They wanted " unfriendly " instead of " enemy , " but once again it 's the same word in Serbo - Croatian , " neprijatelj , " literally " un-friend . "
These kinds of problems caused added time and work to people on a very tight schedule .
British forces in Banja Luka printed a regionally attuned newspaper insert and later a magazine entitled Mostovi .
The German forces in Sarajevo published a bright and lively monthly magazine for teenagers entitled Mirko .
Publication began in June 1996 and production increased to a hundred thousand copies per edition by fall 1997 .
Germany deployed more than 1,350 soldiers in the crisis area .
They included soldiers of the PSYOPS forces who have been part of an international Press and Information Office ( PIO ) since May 2001 .
It was their task to convey the mission and goals of SFOR by means of targeted information campaigns .
Added to which , they were to influence the attitudes and behavior of the target audiences so that the spiral of violence was broken and the Dayton Peace Accord respected .
The SFOR Informer mentions Canadian patrols in Suica and says : Approximately once a week , members of the Canadian Company of paratroopers based in Tomislavgrad carry out patrols in the nearby villages .
These patrols are carried out with a low profile with only a few soldiers walking the streets , visiting restaurants and cafes , and talking to people they meet .
In the small community of Suica , 15 minutes north of Tomislavgrad , this day 's patrol has two purposes .
First of all the patrol is looking for kids to distribute the " Mostovi " magazine .
This magazine is produced by MND - SW and aimed at children and teenagers , presenting SFOR and topics of interest for kids .
The children are offered an opportunity to distribute the magazine in the village for monthly pay .
After talking to people in the local café , the patrol moved back on to the street .
When the school day ended the paratroopers got in touch with some children .
While talking to the first young boy , the other children realized the patrol was offering them a job so they swarmed around the busy Canadians .
" No problem finding eager kids in this town , " Pvt. Paddy Walsh said , while the last magazines were handed out .
Finally , another social patrol is over , while young new SFOR " employees " start earning their pay distributing the " Mostovi " magazine .
The various nations involved in the PSYOP effort retained review or approval authority of their products .
For example , German PSYOP forces had to send each issue of Mirko back to Germany for a final review before dissemination .
This review was established as Germany wanted to avoid any problem with its World War II legacy in the area of operations .
American products had to be approved both by IFOR / SFOR ( NATO chain of command ) and by U.S. EUCOM ( U.S. chain of command ) .
This dual procedure created conflicting requirements , as two staffs ( at IFOR / SFOR and at U.S.EUCOM ) had to see the final products before dissemination when the task force was under pressure to get products to target audiences as quickly as possible .
There are always humorous stories that come from these PSYOP campaigns .
One operator told me of his problems in disseminating the newspapers :
While in Bosnia working on the newspaper the pressure was on to distribute as many newspapers as possible to make the numbers look good .
Typically we would have 10,000 or so to distribute , and a town might have just a few hundred people .
Many shop owners and local citizens were not real enthusiastic about receiving our " propaganda . "
However , one store owner was more than happy to take them , and in fact asked for more .
Upon our second visit to the town we realized how they were getting distributed .
The gentleman was a butcher and was using the papers to wrap meat !
Oh well we thought , at least the people are getting the newspapers .
Major Thomas Bergman also mentions Herald of Peace distribution problems :
There was an ENORMOUS disconnect between Headquarters Sarajevo and the rest of the PSYOP units in other parts of the country .
The Herald of Peace , while a good idea , contained information that was usually outdated by the time it arrived to the Tactical PSYOP Teams for dissemination due to an inadequate distribution network .
I remember traveling to Sarajevo for a PSYOP " Meeting of the Minds , " I believe sometime in February or March of 1996 .
It was revealed that initially foreign nationals were contracted to distribute the Herald of Peace to various towns for dissemination in shops , etc. similar to the free papers here in the U.S. but there was no plan of action to verify that they were actually delivering them .
The belief was that they were getting paid and just dumping the product .
That was the reason for the creation of the " Red Ball Express " which was run by other members of the 18th Psychological Operations Company who were attached to PSYOP command in Sarajevo answerable to Col .
Altschuler .
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization Stabilization Force ( SFOR ) succeeded IFOR on December 20 , 1996 .
The mission 's aims became more ambitious .
In addition to deterring a resumption of hostilities and promoting a climate in which the peace process could continue to move forward , they included providing an increased level of selective support to civilian organizations .
NATO - led Operations in Bosnia - Herzegovina concludes with the following statement about psychological operations : PSYOP was entrusted with a vital mission in a difficult environment : provide an honest alternate viewpoint in a sea of local propaganda and disinformation to facilitate the Dayton Peace Accords implementation .
However , three sets of factors limited the effectiveness of the PSYOP campaign .
First , political sensitivities surrounding the use of PSYOP forces made it more difficult to run an effective , multinational PSYOP campaign .
Second , the weak and conciliatory nature of the PSYOP message limited its potential impact on the local populations .
The task forces ' difficulties in adapting to the local culture and media habits further impaired the campaign .
Finally , these shortcomings were all the more difficult to correct as PSYOP 's assessment of its effort was at best limited .
Mine Warning leaflets
This leaflet is designed to educate people on how to recognize the danger of mines and avoid them .
This 1999 SFOR handbill depicts various mines , grenades , mortars and Claymores on the front and the back and warns civilians against touching any of the dangerous explosives .
This 1998 SFOR poster depicts a child and asks how anyone can believe that mines are harmless .
Warning civilians about the danger of unexploded ordnance has always been a priority of the Allied military forces .
Above is a selection of warning leaflets to the civilians residing in Serbia , Bosnia , Kosovo and other parts of the old Yugoslavia .
PSYOP Problems Target Bosnia discusses problems with the PSYOP effort .
For instance , there was a belief that the PSYOP forces in Bosnia used equipment and media adapted to Third World countries with relatively low - literacy levels .
U.S. PSYOP had been mostly involved in the Persian Gulf , Somalia , Haiti , and Rwanda among others , and leaflets and newspapers were important in those locations .
However the population of Bosnia - Herzegovina was literate , relatively well - educated , and tended to look to television and computers for most of their current information and news .
In addition , U.S. PSYOP assets remained under U.S. control from December 1995 to October 1997 .
Other nations that were expected to support and supply these assets were often slow in doing so .
There was a certain distrust of U.S. PSYOP policy .
European nations felt the PSYOP effort was not fully NATO and were therefore reluctant to become full participants .
They pressed the U.S. to transfer authority to NATO as a prerequisite for more participation .
Finally , in October 1997 , U.S. PSYOP forces in theater were transferred to Supreme Allied Command Europe 's command and control .
There occasionally arose a lack of knowledge of habits and customs .
For example , during 1996 , a handbill depicting a " checklist " of what was done and what had to be achieved was prepared .
After the product was disseminated , it was realized that Bosnians do n't do checklists .
In another example , they developed a poster with a chess game to encourage voting .
Bosnians interpreted it as the international community playing with Bosnia 's future .
Other products did not take into account the local population 's knowledge .
For example , SFOR developed several products on the role of the military , the police , and the media in a democracy .
These products used quotes from Western historic figures like Lincoln , Roosevelt , Clausewitz , or Clemenceau , which were not appropriate for Bosnia - Herzegovina .
These products did not appeal to the Bosnians ' culture or history .
Sergeant Mark F. Jenkins of the 6th PSYOP
Battalion told me some of the problems that he encountered : Many of my memories are of frustration .
We in the 6th PSYOP Battalion had been alerted and then stood down so many times about Bosnia that I think some people had decided we were never really going to go .
I was apparently one of the few Serbo - Croat linguists that had kept up language skills ( and there were only three in the Battalion and one did not deploy ) , something that I found difficult to comprehend , ( and I was only all too aware of my shortcomings as a translator ) .
The potential for deployment to the former Yugoslavia had been apparent for several years .
We went in with so many good ideas and were consistently defeated and ground down by bureaucracy and worse , such as the ridiculously long time it took for news items to get approval for publication .
At one time , we had to submit everything back to Naples , and they tended to sit on it , no matter our deadlines .
I took pains whenever I was briefing any officers to stress that this was a European country we were dealing with , one with modern media , and if we were n't speedy , we had to at least be credible , or we could kiss our influence goodbye .
I 'd watched some of Milosevic 's speeches on Serbian TV during my stint at the US embassy in Belgrade a year or two earlier , and I was struck by how media - savvy he was ( so unlike his portrayal in many Western sources ) .
My position was that the Americans and NATO coming in should be like a wave of fresh air , and we needed to rapidly establish ourselves .
One thing that definitely drove me up a wall was the way we threw our doctrine out the window as soon as it was " game time . "
I was drawing up targeting forms , audience assessments , and all that stuff , and then I was told from the rear in Stuttgart to " stand down . "
That is preposterous .
If doctrine does n't work , you do n't ignore it , you amend the doctrine , or else the lessons learned never get institutionalized .
KOSOVO
In early 1999 , the Serbs again seemed intent on purifying their lands of all foreign ethnic groups .
Television reports told of thousands of ethnic Albanians persecuted , raped , or murdered .
This time the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( NATO ) took action .
NATO demanded full compliance with UN Resolution 1199 of 23 September 1998 .
The resolution called for all parties to cease hostilities .
At a meeting held 15 March 1999 , the Kosovar separatists agreed to a cease - fire , but the government of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic refused .
NATO warned that refusal to cease hostilities against the Kosovar civilians would lead directly to military force .
After a week of Serbian refusals , the 19 - member organization unanimously agreed to initiate air strikes .
The first occurred at 1400 on 24 March 1999 .
NATO aircraft pounded military and political targets within Serbia as part of " Operation Allied Force . "
Fighter aircraft later attacked Serb military forces in Kosovo .
NATO dropped no leaflets during the first week of bombing .
This was surprising .
Since the Serbs tightly controlled their news , the citizenry had no idea of why they were being bombed .
It was crucial for NATO to explain to the masses that the bombing was a direct result of Milosevic 's stubbornness , and that the bombing would cease the moment that Milosevic withdrew Serbian troops from Kosovo .
The Yugoslav Central government dropped aerial propaganda leaflets on the Kosovars on several occasions .
In August of 1998 , a Serbian Internal Affairs Ministry aircraft dropped leaflets over Kosmet and the southern province of Kosovo - Metohija calling on all ethnic Albanians to return to their homes .
The leaflet guaranteed their safety .
The leaflet printed in Serbian and Albanian stated : The Government of Serbia knows the difference between our Albanian citizens and terrorists .
Every citizen wants peace in Kosmet .
It continued : Terrorists can bring nothing good .
They only bring evil ... take your villages , put guns in your hands , dishonor your women and girls , take your money for the so - call Kos Liberation Army , and block roads .
The Serbs dropped leaflets again in April of 1999 .
The Serbs dropped the leaflets over the displaced person 's camp outside of Kisna Reka in Kosovo .
As before , the leaflets told the ethnic Albanians that it was safe to return home and promised safe passage .
NATO finally responded in early April 1999 .
American Hercules EC - 130 Commando Solo aircraft from the 193rd Special Operations
Wing broadcast propaganda programs to the Serbs that filled the airwaves with news and films of the thousands of refugees caused by Milosevic 's ethnic cleaning in Kosovo .
The aircraft , flying from Ramstein Air Base in Germany is able to broadcast AM , FM and TV images over any frequency .
A brief word of introduction about the production of PSYOP in Kosovo and Serbia .
According to documents released by the United States Army , 104.5 million aerial leaflets were dropped over Kosovo during the 78 - day air campaign of Operation Allied Force .
There were 34 distinct types prepared and disseminated .
The leaflets contain 4 - part codes .
The code relates to target audience , theme , action desired , and number of a leaflet in a series .
There are minor differences in the size , paper and ink .
Half the leaflets were produced at Ft. Bragg on digital Heidelberg printers ; half were prepared in Germany on the 3750 series Risograph or the Mobile Print System ( MPS ) .
The sizes vary according to printing machine , local paper availability , and in some cases the artistic layout of the leaflet designers .
In addition , there are minor variations of type size , font and color .
Most of the leaflets are in black and white , though many have words or paragraphs highlighted in color .
We know the total number of leaflets dropped and even the individual numbers .
The problem is that the latter were published using code names like " Think again " and " Questionnaire . "
In those cases that we can identify the leaflet I have listed the number dropped .
In other cases it is impossible to determine what the code name of a specific piece is .
NATO aircraft dropped 2.3 million leaflets in the Serbo - Croatian language over Yugoslavia on the weekend of April 3 and 4 .
These leaflets told the people why they were being bombed , and how to stop it .
The majority of the drops were over the northern area of Yugoslavia where there was little knowledge of the atrocities occurring in Kosovo .
NATO reported a second leaflet drop of 2.5 million leaflets overnight on 10 and 11 April .
Aircraft made the drop during the Orthodox Easter weekend .
The leaflets explained that NATO would stop bombing if Yugoslavia withdrew its forces from Kosovo , allowed refugees to return home , and accepted an international peace force in the province of Kosovo .
The first three NATO leaflets are the standard 6 x 3 " size , considered the optimum for pinpoint dropping on selected targets .
The first has black text on white paper .
The text is in Serbo - Croatian and Cyrillic .
The left side of the leaflet is blue .
There is a NATO symbol at the right and the word " HATO . "
When turned over , the paper is all white , the NATO symbol is at the upper left and lower right , and two words are highlighted in red .
There is no code number on this leaflet , but the official code number is 04 - Q - 07 - L0001-d .
The title of this leaflet is " NATO Strikes . "
The text on this leaflet says :
In March 1998 , the United Nations called for a diplomatic solution to the conflict in Kosovo .
Since then , the international community has made every effort to find a peaceful compromise .
On 18 March 1999 the Kosovar Albanians agreed to a plan that would disarm the KLA and keep an autonomous Kosovo as a legal part of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia .
However , your political leadership not only spurned this opportunity , but also stepped up its military campaign of repression and violence against the entire Kosovar Albanian population .
The Interim Political Agreement - the road to peace .
Text on the other side of the leaflet states :
As a direct result of your government 's actions , NATO has conducted air - strikes against military targets .
NATO has no quarrel with the Serb people , or their right to national Sovereignty .
NATO and the international community still desire a peaceful solution for Kosovo .
The leaflets were first dropped on the far - northern town of Subotica .
NATO aircraft dropped 3.6 million of this leaflet .
The second leaflet is somewhat similar .
It has the same NATO symbol and word " HATO " at the lower right .
They are in blue .
The rest of the text is in black and the paper is white .
When turned over , the paper is all white , the NATO symbol is at the upper left and lower right in blue , and several words are in blue .
The title once again is " NATO Strikes . "
Some of the text reads :
For the last week Serb armies and police , under direct orders of Slobodan Milosevic , have emptied the villages and towns of Kosovo and burned or destroyed thousands of houses .
Heads of families have been pulled from the arms of their wives and children and shot .
Thousands of innocent and unarmed people are feared dead .
Hundreds of thousands of refugees are fleeing Milosevic 's pogrom .
Do not allow misguided patriotism to blind you to his atrocities .
NATO defends the defenseless .
The code number on this leaflet 04 - B - 02 - L001 .
The third leaflet bears two photographs .
One side shows a gruff looking Slobodan Milosevic .
The text and photo are in black on white paper .
The text beneath the photo of Milosevic reads :
For years , Slobodan Milosevic has gambled with the future of the Serb people .
His policies have lost Krajina , Western Slavonia , Baranja , and Sarajevo .
Now he gambles again with his pogrom in Kosovo .
He is wagering Serbia 's sacred places , her place in the world , and the lives of his own people .
Are these truly his to lose ?
The other side of the leaflet shows a burning building .
Text next to the burning building is :
Is it really his to gamble ?
This leaflet is coded 04 - B - 02 - L002 .
This same general format was used on about seven leaflets other leaflets , with the Milosevic portrait sometimes in red , sometimes in blue .
NATO aircraft dropped 7.6 million of these leaflets .
Another leaflet picturing Milosevic is found in two formats , the difference being that one version is in a darker blue with some blue text in the message while the other is in a lighter blue and the text is all black .
5.9 million of these leaflets were printed with the codename " Nepotism . "
The text to the right of Milosevic 's picture is :
War and sacrifice for you
Good money for him , his family and his friends .
The back is all text : Serbia 's economy is crippled ; her war machine under attack .
But through it all , Milosevic , his family , and his inner circle have managed to make millions .
Tight control of state - run monopolies has given Milosevic an illicit financial empire at the expense of those he claims to defend .
His son Marko waits out the war in comfort .
He does not serve as ordinary Serbs must .
While your sons and husbands fight , Marko Milosevic parties in Belgrade or works on his sun-tan at the family villa in the Mediterranean .
Milosevic 's nepotism , cronyism , and genocide in Kosovo have drained Serbia 's economic resources and dragged the country into war with the world .
Is he the kind of leader you really want ?
In mid-April 1999 , the NATO attack plan added tactical strikes against the Serb military forces in Kosovo to the strategic bombing of Serbia .
Aircraft searched out troops , vehicles and armor taking part in the Kosovar persecution .
A new series of leaflets threatening the Serb military forces was prepared .
Each of these took the NATO four - pointed star and turned it into crosshairs as might be seen through a target scope .
The first ( fourth overall in the new series ) leaflet pictured an AH - 64 Apache attack helicopter in the foreground , and a small Serb tank silhouette in target crosshairs in the background .
The Apache helicopter has a M230 30 mm multi- barrel chain gun and 16 laser - guided Hellfire missiles .
The Hellfire has a range of 4.4 miles and a speed of Mach 1.7 .
It is a deadly tank killer .
The Coalition dropped this leaflet about 15 April .
The leaflet says in Serbo - Croat , " Do n't wait for me " on the front beneath the helicopter .
Text on the back reads : Attention VJ ( Yugoslav Army ) Forces !
You can hide , but NATO forces still see you .
Remain in Kosovo and face certain death ; or leave your unit and equipment , and get out of Kosovo now .
If you choose to stay , NATO forces will relentlessly attack you , with many different weapon systems , from many different nations , from the land , from the sea , from the sky .
Stop following Milosevic 's orders to commit genocide and other atrocities against civilians in Kosovo .
You are responsible for your own actions , and ultimately will be held accountable .
The choice is yours .
The text is in black except for the first and last lines which are in blue .
The code number is 03 - Q- 09 - L004 .
The same message appeared on both this leaflet and the following A - 10 leaflet .
NATO aircraft dropped 4.5 million of the leaflets with this text message .
Philip M. Taylor criticized this leaflet in Munitions of the Mind : A history of Propaganda from the Ancient World to the Present Day , Manchester University Press , UK , 2003 : Given that the Apache was never deployed during the air campaign because of orders to fight the war from above 15,000 feet , the failure to deliver what was promised in the messages was symptomatic of a defective PSYOP campaign that failed to break either the Serb military or civilian morale .
We should point out that the threatening portrait of an Apache attack helicopter was used again by the SFOR PSYOP team about 1999 .
The text is : SFOR Bringing about cooperation and providing peace for all .
One wonders how good this leaflet was as PSYOP since it is difficult to motivate people to accept cooperation and peace while threatening them with annihilation .
The fifth leaflet is similar .
It pictures an A - 10 Thunderbolt aircraft ( commonly known as " the warthog " ) in the foreground .
The Thunderbolt is firing a missile .
Once again , a small Serb tank silhouette in target crosshairs is shown in the background .
The A - 10 is armed with a GAU - 8/ A 30 mm seven - barrel Avenger cannon which fires approximately 4,000 armor- piercing rounds per minute , and six Maverick missiles .
The Maverick has a range of 25 miles at subsonic speed .
Text on the front of this leaflet beneath the aircraft is :
Do n't wait for me !
Text on the back is :
Over 13,000 Yugoslavian service members have already left the armed forces because they can no longer follow the illegal orders in Milosevic 's war against the civilians in Kosovo .
Remain in Kosovo and face certain death , or leave your unit and equipment , and get out of Kosovo now .
If you choose to stay , NATO forces will relentlessly attack you from every direction .
The choice is yours .
The text is in black except for the first and last lines which are in blue .
The code number is 03 - Q- 09 - L004 .
The same message appeared on both this leaflet and the previous Apache leaflet .
NATO aircraft dropped 4.5 million of the leaflets with this text message .
A sixth leaflet shows target crosshairs on a Serb tank .
Text on the back reads : Attention Serbian Armed Forces .
You are a NATO target .
Halt your current operations and return to your garrisons immediately .
If you fail to follow these instructions , NATO will continue to attack your unit .
Save your lives .
Flee while you can .
This leaflet is coded 03 - Q - 02 - L003 .
NATO aircraft may have dropped 800,000 of this leaflet .
A second tactical version of the same leaflet has the text : Attention 78th Motorized Brigade , 211 Armor brigade , 52nd and 78th Mixed Artillery , and attached units .
You are a NATO bombing target .
You will continue to be bombed until you return to your garrisons .
Return while you still can .
The code number of this variation is 03 - Q - 02 - L008 .
NATO aircraft may have dropped 300,000 of this leaflet .
Master Sergeant ( retired ) Rod Schmidt of B Company of the 9th Psychological Operations Battalion told me :
The sniper - scope green target leaflet dropped on Yugoslavia was based on a design I provided to 6th POB , although they modified it .
Originally , I had designed it to resemble the light green , grainy tinge of low - light scopes without the NATO symbol .
They were forced to darken the green color because the presses they had at that time just could n't print the light green design at a high enough resolution to render the image clearly .
A seventh leaflet gives the frequencies of five radio and a television channel that the people could tune in to receive NATO radio and television broadcasts .
The leaflet has the title " We want to talk to you . "
The radio stations listed are FM 92.5 , FM 102.2 , FM106.4 and AM 1003 .
Television channel 21 is listed , but I understand that only fuzzy pictures and weak audio could be heard over this channel .
The text on the front of the leaflet is : Mornings in Belgrade .
Interviews with world leaders .
News : international and regional .
Messages to the Serb people .
NATO policy statement .
NATO allied voice .
Radio and television station .
The back of the leaflet is all tex : FM 92.5 , FM 106.4 , FM 102.2 , AM 1003 , TV Channel 21 .
We want to talk to you .
The code number of this leaflet is 04 - E - 03 - L001 .
NATO aircraft dropped 1.2 million of this leaflet .
This captured still from a TV screen was broadcast from an EC - 130 orbiting over Serbia .
It clearly shows the logo of UHF Channel 21 .
The picture depicts a crying child at the right and what appears to be hand with a " V " for victory in a window at the right .
The hand is being pulled from the window , apparently to safeguard the person giving the sign .
A ninth leaflet shows a photograph of Slobodan Milosevic with an arrow pointing backwards .
The text above the president 's name read
No gasoline , no electricity , no trade , no freedom , no future .
This leaflet was dropped in late April as a warning of the coming bombing of crucial services like electricity and water .
On 3 May , NATO attacked the hydroelectric power station west of Belgrade and darkened much of Serbia .
The weapon used was a bomb containing thin graphite wires and particles that short - circuit the power lines , but do not destroy the generators .
There were continued attacks on oil and gasoline stocks , and talk of a NATO boycott .
How long will you suffer for Milosevic ?
As long as Milosevic is going to continue his program of destruction , rape , and murder in Kosovo , Serbia will drift deeper into international isolation .
Do n't let Milosevic hold you hostage to his atrocities .
The code number of this leaflet is 04 - B - 02 - L004 .
This leaflet was printed in two varieties with minor color difference .
By 29 April , over 19 million leaflets had been dropped over Yugoslavia .
Many of these leaflets were dropped along the Kosovo border where Serbs troops were operating .
Belgrade radio reported that NATO had dropped propaganda leaflets on 27 April near the Macedonian border and over Novi Sad on 29 April .
This number grew to 33 million leaflets by 9 May , with 14 leaflet drops over 12 cities in Yugoslavia .
There was no mention of leaflet drops for several weeks , than another flurry at the end of May .
The first mentioned the alleged dropping of thousands of NATO leaflets over Serbian troops in Kosovo on 26 - 27 May .
This leaflet was meant to remind the Serb military leadership that they were being watched and their crimes would be prosecuted .
The officers were told that their names had been collected and evidence of genocide , killings , ethnic cleansing , rapes , forced deportations , mass graves , looting , destruction of homes , destruction of religious and cultural objects , and crimes again humanity were being recorded .
This information was being collected and forwarded to a tribunal in The Hague .
The leaflet reminded the troops that every commander and other Army officers are responsible for the behavior and acts of his subordinates .
It reminds soldiers that they do not have to obey illegal orders because everything will be documented and they will pay the consequences .
These leaflets list the names of the commanders of the units operating in Kosovo .
Text on the front of the leaflet is : Attention VJ forces !
Right now the world is recording evidence of widespread war crimes by Serb military and paramilitary forces in Kosovo .
The emerging picture of atrocities against innocent civilians is clear and compelling .
Detailed intelligence reports are going to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia at the Hague .
Remember the Nuremberg Trials .
Commanders : every leader is responsible for the actions of his subordinates .
Soldiers : Illegal orders must not be obeyed .
The world is watching you !
You will be held accountable .
The back of the leaflet names the commander , " Units and Commander ... under scrutiny in Kosovo .
MG Vladmir Lavarevic - Prishtina Corps , COL Milos Mandic - 252nd Armored Brigade , COL Mladen Cirkovic - 15th Armored Brigade , COL Dragan Zivanovic - 125th Motorized brigade , COL Kirsman Jelic - 243rd Mechanized Brigade , COL Bozhidar Delic - 549th Motorized Brigade , COL Milos Djosan - 52nd Light Air Defense , and MAJ Zeljko Pekovic - 52nd Military Police Battalion .
Reported atrocities .
Genocide , murder , human shields , ethnic cleansing , rape , forced evacuations , mass graves , robbery , deportation , destruction of protected property , and crimes against humanity .
The world is watching you .
Every leader is held accountable for the actions of his subordinates .
The code number of this leaflet is 03 - X - 04 - L002 .
NATO aircraft dropped 8.7 million of this leaflet .
The Allies did something similar during WWII when they showed photographs and dossiers of certain Nazi leaders on leaflets and mentioned that the hangman 's rope was awaiting them .
The Coalition was serious about war crimes .
As soon as the " shooting war " was over they began to search for and arrest individuals they considered war criminals .
This poster is interesting because it is an early use of the " wanted " poster , later used by the United States in Iraq and Afghanistan after the 2001 terrorist attacks .
This 1998 poster shows both wanted war criminals and those who have already been captured .
On 29 May , two additional leaflets were mentioned in the press .
Pentagon officials announced that NATO was trying to exploit friction between Yugoslav Army troops and the Interior Ministry Police by exacerbating the situation .
NATO is dropping leaflets that read : Attention VJ Troops !
While you endure NATO bombing in the field , low of fuel and supplies , unpaid and past your service obligation , the MUP return home to count the profits from their confiscated " booty . "
They draw regular pay , use your equipment at your expense , and investigate you for not following their orders .
Meanwhile , you have been drafted and forced from your families to wage a war which you know is dishonorable and wrong .
The only thing you share is blame for the MUPs atrocities .
The red text on the back of the leaflet is :
Your blood , their rewards .
The code number is 03 - K - 06 - L001 .
NATO aircraft dropped 2.7 million of this leaflet .
Like Hitler 's " SS " and Hussein 's " Republican Guard , " The police are considered loyal to President Slobodan Milosevic .
They are better equipped and often receive better treatment than their army counterparts .
The inequality of treatment has created a long - standing animosity between the two services .
Once again , this technique was used in WWII to cause friction between the German Wehrmacht and the SS , and again in the Persian Gulf to point out inequalities between the Iraqi conscripts and the Republican Guard .
A United States Air Force officer told me that this leaflet was very effective and there was at least one case where a Serbian Reserve military unit mutinied and elected to return to Serbia to protect their families from the alleged abuses of the MUP .
He said that it made him a believer in PSYOP .
The second leaflet reported on 29 May depicts the USAF B - 52 Stratofortress .
It was reported that two such aircraft were seen over Pristina at 1400 GMT dropping leaflets that warned Yugoslav troops to leave Kosovo .
The text is : Attention VJ Forces , Leave Kosovo , NATO is now using B - 52 bombers to drop MK - 82 225 - kilogram heavy bombs on the Yugoslav Army units in Kosovo .
Every B - 52 bomber can carry more than 50 of these bombs .
These planes will keep coming back for you until they expel your unit from Kosovo and prevent you from committing atrocities .
If you want to survive and see your family again , abandon your unit and weapon and leave Kosovo immediately !
Thousands of bombs ... and the will , and the power , and the support of the entire world to relentlessly drop them on your unit .
The back of the leaflet shows a B - 52 dropping bombs .
The code number of this leaflet is 03 - NN - 17 - L002 .
NATO aircraft dropped 1.6 million of this leaflet .
The expressed reason for these leaflets from the very first day was to educate the common Serb of the reason for the bombing .
For instance , NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said on 11 April :
We have dropped leaflets on Yugoslavia ... to allow any willing Yugoslav to be able to read the position of the international community ....
There were some negative comments about the leaflet campaign .
A number of Serbs indicated that the language was stilted , incorrect , and not as good as the leaflets dropped by the Nazis during WWII .
This could be an attempt to attack the technical quality of the leaflet while ignoring the message --
The old " shoot the messenger " ploy .
Philip Taylor did n't think this leaflet was very effective .
He says that :
In Kosovo itself , VJ forces received warnings that they were about to be attacked unless they left the area .
This technique was copied from Kuwait when leaflets warning of impending attacks by Daisy Cutter bombs and B - 52s were successful in clearing the battlefield of enemy forces .
In Kosovo , however , the Yugoslav army was a very different proposition to that of Iraq 's largely conscripted forces .
The Yugoslav army did not flee .
Highly skilled in deception and camouflage techniques , it moved around with considerable skill to avoid the destructive power of the NATO air campaign .
In Vojvodina an elderly man was quoted as saying that the Nazi leaflets were good for cigarette rolling paper , but the NATO leaflets " are n't even good for that . "
Many academians believed that the threats and bullying tactics would harden the will of the Serbs .
Perhaps a stronger criticism was made by one of our ex-military officers who spent a lifetime in PSYOP .
He said :
Where is the empathy with the masses ?
Where is the expression of sorrow for the disruption in the lives of the innocent ?
Where is the expression of regret for the damage to the infrastructure ?
It sounds as if our total PSYOP effort is about as subtle and psychological as a turd in a punch bowl .
A rather colorful way to express one 's disdain of the campaign .
In addition , it seems that the Serbs are using bacteriological threats to frighten their own people and keep them from picking up the leaflets .
The Serbs have been masters of using the Internet for their own purposes .
One letter in Soc.culture .
Yugoslavia was entitled " NATO is using biological warfare . "
It went on to state that : I have already wrote you that NATO airplanes are dropping propaganda papers from time to time on cities all over the country .
In addition , those papers are found to be bacteriological positive .
There 's another thing ... workers who were packing these papers in airplanes were wearing special anti-bio - chemical suits ... strange ?
This attempt to frighten the masses with germ or explosive scares is an old trick used on many occasions in warfare .
The last thing a government in power desires is that you pick up and read enemy propaganda .
The Serbs also used posters and postcards to tell their side of the story .
Some of their work was very well done .
They used scenes of terrified and threatened women and children to strike an emotional chord in the viewer .
Perhaps the most interesting Serb retaliation was mentioned by Melissa Dittman in " Operation Hearts and Minds , " Monitor on Psychology , June 2003 :
The enemy can also try to counter PSYOP more directly .
During the Kosovo contingency operations , Serb agents reportedly contacted Serbo - Croatian translators working with the U.S. Army at Fort Bragg and threatened harm to them and their families if they continued to support U.S. information efforts .
As we stated earlier , by the conclusion of the operation , 104.5 - million leaflets were dropped by NATO , 34 different leaflets in 31 distinct varieties .
There were numerous themes .
Some of the more interesting ones are : 1 . Divide and conquer .
For example , the leaflet telling the Army that the police were better - equipped and committing crimes that the military would be blamed for .
Leaflet 03 - NN - 20 - LOO2 uses this theme by telling the troops that while they are away at the front , Milosevic is attacking their families at home .
This leaflet attempts to divide the military troops from the Serbian government .
The front shows Serb troops carrying protective shields advancing against civilians .
The text is :
While you are away fighting Milosevic 's war in Kosovo Families in villages and town across Serbia and Montenegro have begun to protest the war , calling for the return of their sons and husbands ...
The back is all text and says in part :
Only unity will save the Serbs
In response , Milosevic has greeted them with water cannons , riot police , and charges of treason .
It seems there is no difference to Milosevic between a Kosovar Albanian rebel and a Serb civilian trying to express their frustration with Government policy .
In response to the violent Serb crackdown , entire units from the Krusevac and Alexsandrovac area have left their positions in Kosovo - Metohija against orders and returned home to defend their families ... from their own government .
Return home where you are needed ... before Milosevic treats Paracin ... like Pristina .
I am told that at least two Serbian cities were taken off the bombing target list because allied leafleting had caused mothers and grandmothers to take to the streets in protest .
The " riots " were photographed and helped to convince some military units to return home from Kosovo .
This leaflet was extremely effective at destroying the Serbian military morale .
2 . Overwhelming strength of NATO forces .
The leaflets showing helicopters , fighter aircraft , rocket - launchers and B - 52 bombers .
3 . Overwhelming size of the force aligned against Serbia .
A good example of this theme is the " flag " leaflet .
During the Korean War , leaflet 2506 depicted 54 flags of the nations aligned against the Democratic Republic of ( North ) Korea .
During the Vietnam war , the allies printed a leaflet showing the flags of the seven nations aligned against the Democratic Republic of ( North ) Vietnam .
During Operation Desert Storm , the Coalition dropped leaflets bearing the flags of the 27 nations aligned to drive the forces of Saddam Hussein from Kuwait .
The theme of the great number of powers gathered against an enemy has always been a favorite of U.S. PSYOP .
The allied forces that took part in the war to drive the forces of Slobodan Milosevic from Kosovo disseminated leaflets showing the flags of the 19 NATO members .
Text on the front is , " We are fully committed ... The arsenals of Democracy run deep .
We can fight this campaign for months and months ... if not years .
General Henry Shelton , Chairman , US Joint Chiefs of Staff , 30 April 1999 . "
The back is all text , " Slobodan Milosevic has been terribly successful in using his military and paramilitary forces to commit horrendous atrocities , including mass murders , systematic rapes and forced evacuation against unarmed civilians in Kosovo - Metohija , and hiding the fact from his own citizens .
What he did n't expect was that he would be even more successful in isolating Serbia from the rest of the world and in unifying NATO and the world community of nations in its resolve to stop Serb atrocities and return the people of Kosovo - Metohija to their homes in safety .
He would do well to listen to the words of his own military experts : ' Serbs have fought a war since 1991 while still not having a single ally anywhere .
Not even the Russian Federation has declared itself our ally ...'
Col General Momcilo Perisic , Former VJ Chief of Staff , February 1999 . "
The code number of this leaflet is 04 - B - 02 - L009 .
NATO aircraft dropped 4.3 million of this leaflet .
4 . Leave your equipment .
The leaflets showing Serb tanks in crosshairs is a good example .
Hackers Hijacked Large E-Bill Payment Site
Hackers on Tuesday hijacked the Web site CheckFree.com , one of the largest online bill payment companies , redirecting an unknown number of visitors to a Web address that tried to install malicious software on visitors ' computers , the company said today .
The attack , first reported by The Register , a security news Web site , began in the early morning hours of Dec. 2 , when Checkfree 's home page and the customer login page were redirected to a server in the Ukraine .
CheckFree spokeswoman Melanie Tolley said users who visited the sites during the attack would have been redirected to a blank page that tried to install malware .
Tolley added that CheckFree regained control over its site by 5 a.m. on Dec. 2 .
The company said it was still having the malware analyzed by experts .
" The degree of exposure to users is dependent on how current their anti-virus software is and what browser they used to connect with , " Tolley said , adding that the company will release more information about the attack as it becomes available .
But Paul Ferguson , a threat researcher with anti-virus firm Trend Micro , said Trend 's analysis of the malware indicates that it is a new strain of Trojan horse program designed to steal user names and passwords .
It appears hackers were able to hijack the company 's Web sites by stealing the user name and password needed to make account changes at the Web site of Network Solutions , Check Free 's domain registrar .
Susan Wade , a spokeswoman for the Herndon , Va. , based registrar , said that at around 12:30 a.m. Dec. 2 , someone logged in using the company 's credentials and changed the address of CheckFree 's authoritative domain name system ( DNS ) servers to point CheckFree site visitors to the Internet address in the Ukraine .
DNS servers serve as a kind of phone book for Internet traffic , translating human - friendly Web site names into numeric Internet addresses that are easier for computers to handle .
" Someone got access to [ CheckFree 's ] account credentials and was able to log in , " Wade said .
" There was no breach in our system . "
Among the 330 kinds of bills you can pay through CheckFree are military credit accounts , utility bills , insurance payments , mortgage and loan payments .
Browsing through the first few letters of the company 's alphabetized customer list reveals some big names , including Allegheny Power , Allstate Insurance AT&T , Bank of America , and Chrysler Financial .
See the full list of companies here .
CheckFree's
Tolley stressed that the attack occurred during off - peak hours when customer traffic to its
Web site is typically low .
Still , CheckFree has a huge customer base :
The company claims that some 24.7 million consumers initiate payments through its services .
CheckFree declined to say how many of its customers and companies it handles payments for may have been affected by the attack .
But this thread over at an Ubuntu Linux mailing list suggests that U.S. Bank may also have been affected by this attack .
U.S. Bank did not return calls seeking comment .
Update , Dec. 6 , 2:11 p.m. ET :: For more on this developing story , please see the post Security Fix published today , Digging Deeper Into the CheckFree Attack .
A Glendale man has been arrested and accused of vandalizing a photo enforcement camera with a pickax .
Authorities say a state Department of Public Safety motorcycle officer witnessed a man wielding a large ax Wednesday night , striking the metal and glass housing that protects a photo enforcement camera off 59th Avenue and Loop 101 .
Travis Munroe Townsend , 26 , was arrested and charged with criminal damage , interference with a traffic control device and criminal trespass .
DPS officials said the vandalism did not affect the integrity of the camera 's operations , but a new protective housing had to be installed , costing several thousand dollars .
The camera was fully operational by 11 a.m.
Thursday , officials said .
" Any type of tampering with a photo enforcement site can result in extremely serious , life - changing charges being filed against a person , " DPS Director Roger Vanderpool said .
" DPS officers will continue to be vigilant at all hours of the day and night and stand ready to respond quickly to reports or first - hand observances of persons tampering with or vandalizing photo enforcement sites in any manner . "
When Mechanics Go Bad
Taking your car to a repair shop is like going to a doctor .
You expect to be treated professionally and have your problems fixed .
But sometimes doctors make terrible mistakes , such as amputating the wrong leg or leaving a scalpel in your body .
Mechanics are no different .
Here are some extreme examples of mechanics gone bad :
The Basics : Car Lift
You would think most mechanics would be extra careful when it comes to exotic cars .
These pictures prove otherwise .
Here 's a $ 300,000 Bentley Azure " resting " on its side .
This mechanic did n't read the owner 's manual for jacking up a Lotus Elise
The " Test " Drive
Most mechanics will test the car out after a major tune - up or repair to make sure everything works correctly .
Some take the test a little too far ...
Like the mechanic who drove this Acura NSX up to 110 mph and crashed it through a fence .
... or this mechanic who lost control and drove a customer 's Lamborghini Diablo up a curb and into a wall
This mechanic had just finished fixing a small scratch on the side of this $ 450,000 Porsche Carrera GT .
Of course he had to " test " the car out to make sure the car was still aerodynamic .
Too bad he made the problem worse .
And the Winner Is ...
This mechanic who managed to destroy one of the rarest vehicles in the world .
A $ 500,000 Bugatti EB110 !
He was test driving the car after an annual checkup .
Unfortunately it was raining and he was n't very careful .

Abstract
The antiviral drug acyclovir is a guanosine nucleoside analog that potently inhibits herpes simplex virus ( HSV ) replication .
Acyclovir treatment in patients coinfected with HSV and human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) has been observed to alter disease course and decrease HIV viral load , a finding that has been attributed to indirect effects of HSV suppression on HIV replication .
Based on this hypothesis , several clinical studies have recently investigated the use of acyclovir for treatment of patients coinfected with HSV and HIV or for prophylaxis against HIV transmission .
In this report , we use a single round HIV infectivity assay to show that acyclovir directly inhibits HIV infection with an IC 50 of ∼ 5 μm .
The target of acyclovir in HIV - infected cells is validated as HIV reverse transcriptase ( RT ) by the emergence of the RT variant V75I under the selective pressure of acyclovir .
The V75I mutation is part of the multidrug resistance pathway that enhances viral resistance to many of the best RT inhibitors approved for the treatment of HIV .
Biochemical analyses demonstrate that acyclovir triphosphate is a chain terminator substrate for HIV RT and can compete with dGTP for incorporation into DNA .
Although acyclovir may prove a useful lead for development of new HIV treatments , the selection of resistant mutants raises a cautionary note to the use of acyclovir monotherapy in patients coinfected with HSV and HIV .
POZNAN , Poland ( Reuters ) - Developing nations accused the rich of meanness on Saturday at the end of U.N. climate talks that launched only a tiny fund to help poor countries cope with droughts , floods and rising seas .
A woman gives money to a Greenpeace activist dressed as a homeless polar bear who was trying to hitch hike to Copenhagen , in Poznan , where U.N. climate talks were held , December 12 , 2008 .
Host Poland stuck to a proposal to agree a " Solidarity Partnership " at the end of U.N. climate talks on Friday despite criticism by many nations that progress was too scant to merit a sweeping title .
The new climate treaty will be adopted in Copenhagen at a meeting from Nov. 30 - Dec. 11 , 2009 .

They said the size of the Adaptation Fund -- worth just $ 80 million -- was a bad omen at the halfway mark of two years of negotiations on a new treaty to fight global warming designed to be agreed in Copenhagen at the end of 2009 .
“ We are so sad and so disappointed , ” Colombian Environment Minister Juan Lozano said of the December 1 - 12 talks , which went on into the early hours of Saturday and have been overshadowed by worries that global economic woes are drying up donor cash .
“ The human side of climate change is the suffering of our orphans and our victims and that was not considered here .
It ’s a bad signal on the road to Copenhagen , ” said Lozano .
“ I must say that this is one of the saddest moments I have witnessed in all these years , ” Indian representative Prodipto Ghosh told delegates at the 189 - nation talks , adding he had attended U.N. climate meetings for 12 years .
Several other nations including Brazil , Costa Rica and Maldives made similar remarks .
Many delegates expressed hopes that U.S. President - elect Barack Obama would adopt more aggressive climate policies .
Environment ministers at the talks in Poland set rules for the Adaptation Fund , which is meant to help poor nations build flood defenses , develop drought - resistant crops , or produce storm warnings .
Polish Environment Minister Maciej Nowicki , the host , said the launch of the fund was the biggest achievement of Poznan .
The fund , which can start paying out cash in 2009 , has just $ 80 million but could rise to $ 300 million a year by 2012 .
BILLIONS NEEDED
U.N. projections are that poor nations will need tens of billions of dollars a year by 2030 to cope with climate change .
Poland spent 24 million euros ( $ 31.84 million ) just to host the December 1 - 12 conference .
Developing nations accused the rich of blocking agreement in Poznan on a wider funding mechanism that could raise about $ 2 billion a year .
The issue was delayed until 2009 .
Yvo de Boer , head of the U.N. Climate Change Secretariat , said the talks achieved all they had set out to do but acknowledged there was “ some bitterness . ”
“ Half the work ( for Copenhagen ) has n’t been done , ” he said .
Still , he said Poznan had achieved a main task of reviewing progress toward a sweeping new global climate treaty in Copenhagen in December 2009 to replace the Kyoto Protocol .
Environmentalists disagreed .
“ We are desperately disappointed with the progress here , ” said Stephanie Tunmore of the Greenpeace environmental group .
“ The stocktaking bit was n’t difficult : ‘ What did we do in 2008 ?
Not much ’. ”

Environmentalists accused Australia , Canada , Japan and New Zealand of blocking progress and failing to set ambitious new goals to cut emissions .
By contrast , countries including Mexico , China and South Africa laid out ideas to curb rising emissions .
European Environment Commissioner Stavros Dimas said talks were on track .
“ Everyone said the fight against climate change is consistent with tackling the economic crisis , ” he said .
European Union ministers in Poznan expressed relief after EU leaders in Brussels agreed a pact on Friday to cut greenhouse gases by 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 -- after making costly concessions to east European countries .
Under the Adaptation Fund , cash is raised by a 2 percent levy on a U.N. system of projects to cut greenhouse gas emissions in poor nations .
The levy has raised 60 million euros ( $ 80 million ) so far .

Of course players sitting around the same table playing a game are going to be saying stuff that sometimes the characters being played by the players right next to them are not aware of .
As a GM , there are a few ways to deal with this :
You can enforce strict rules and separate the players so they can't communicate when their characters are out of contact .
You can insist that players write down anything that should be secret from other characters and engage in note - passing to communicate with the GM .
You can trust the players to faithfully separate player and character knowledge , and play their characters as if they do n't know what the other players are thinking .
Use every piece of player knowledge you can get your hands on to your own advantage .

R2 - D2 : All right !
Another hundred droids and I can level .
Anakin :
Is that what you 're doing ?
What about our mission ?
R2 - D2 : Next level I can get Enhanced Environmental Sealing .
I 'm obviously not going to infiltrate an enemy HQ without that .
Anakin :
It 's so touching that you 're into self - improvement .
{scene cuts to Jar Jar on the battlefield , surrounded by droids}
Captain Tarpals : Wesa done for , Jar Jar .
Jar Jar :
Not yet !
Here 's da plan .
Jar Jar : Artoo issa very smart droid .
Hesa can use da Trade Federation computers to tell da droids to stop working !
Captain Tarpals :
But how yousa gonna tell him that ?
{scene cuts back to R2 - D2 , shown in a moment of silence}
R2 - D2 : Oooh !
I just had a brilliant idea !
I hack into the Trade Federation 's computer systems and spoof a shutdown command for the droid army !
R2 - D2 : Oh look , it 's my best skill .
I roll 10001 .
GM : Er ...
There 's no way R2 could know what Jar Jar thought of .
R2 - D2 : Do I sound like I 'm talking in character ?
The first demonstration that a single adult stem cell can self - renew in a mammal was reported at the American Society for Cell Biology ( ASCB ) 48th Annual Meeting , Dec. 13 - 17 , 2008 in San Francisco .
The transplanted adult stem cell and its differentiated descendants restored lost function to mice with hind limb muscle tissue damage .
The adult stem cells used in the study , conducted at Stanford University , were isolated from a mixed population of satellite cells in the skeletal muscle of mice .
The skeletal adult muscle stem cells ( MusSC ) , which live just under the membrane that surrounds muscle fibers , normally respond to tissue damage by giving rise to progenitor cells that become myoblasts , fusing into myofibers to repair the tissue damage .
The scientists transplanted the MusSC into special immune - suppressed " nude " mice whose muscle satellite cells had been wiped out in a hind limb by irradiation .
The mice would only be able to repair injury if the transplanted MuSC " took . "
The scientists , Alessandra Sacco and Helen Blau , had genetically engineered the transplanted MusSC to express Pax7 and luciferase proteins .
As a result , every transplanted cell glowed under ultraviolet light and was easy to trace .
" To be able to detect the presence of the cells by bioluminescence was really a breakthrough , " says Blau .
" It taught us so much more .
We could see how the cells were responding , and really monitor their dynamics . "
Through luminescent imaging as well as quantitative and kinetic analyses , Sacco and Blau tracked each transplanted stem cell as it rapidly proliferated and engrafted its progeny into the irradiated muscle tissue .
The scientists then injured the regenerated tissue , setting off massive waves of muscle cell growth and repair , and subsequently showed that the MuSC and descendents rescued the second animal 's lost muscle healing function .
After isolating the luciferase - glowing muscle stem cells from the transplanted animal , the scientists duplicated , or cloned , the cells in the lab .
Like the original MuSC , the cloned copies were intact and capable of self - renewal .
" We are thrilled with the results , " says Sacco .
" It 's been known that these satellite cells are crucial for the regeneration of muscle tissue , but this is the first demonstration of self - renewal of a single cell . "
The ability to isolate and then transplant skeletal adult muscle stems cells could have a wide impact in treating not only a variety of muscle wasting diseases such as muscular dystrophy but also severe muscle injuries or loss of function from aging and disuse .
In other experiments , the researchers transplanted between 10 and 500 luciferase - tagged MuSC into the leg muscles of mice .
These cells also proliferated and engrafted , forming new myofibers and fusing with injured fibers .
Unlike tumor cells , the transplanted stem cells achieved homeostasis , growing to a stable , constant level and ceasing replication .
After demonstrating that the transplanted stem cells proliferated and fully restored the animal 's lost function , Sacco and Blau recovered new stem cells from the transplant with full stem cell potency , meeting the final " gold standard " test for adult multipotent stem cells .

A recent study of unemployment data by the Fiscal Policy Institute , a liberal research group , shows that the number of workers in manufacturing who are receiving unemployment benefits grew by 11 percent between October 2007 and October 2008 , compared with a 67 percent increase in the finance and insurance industries and 56 percent in the construction industry .
“ If they ’ve been flourishing , they ’ll be able to survive , ” said Mitchell Moss , a professor of urban policy and planning at New York University who has tracked the rise of the city ’s niche manufacturers .
“ Their competitive advantage is the quality and design of their production . ”
That is not to say that all niche manufacturers will avoid the recession or that their prosperity will boost the economy .
At least one woodworking company at the Navy Yard has gone out of business .
Some businesses there reported that business is not as strong as before .
And many face limited growth because there are only so many customers for products like body armor , $ 6,000 speakers and $ 3,000 tables .
“ There ’s a natural limitation to what they do , ” said Cliff Waldman , an economist with the Manufacturers Alliance / M.A.P.I. , a research organization in Arlington , Va. , that is supported by multinational manufacturers .
“ They have a few people with specialized skills and they service a few markets . ”
But it is also clear that smaller manufacturers have been expanding even as the city ’s more traditional industrial base has continued to shrink .
In Brooklyn , the number of jobs for niche manufacturers , which are not only small but also tend to have local clients , rose by 17 percent between 2001 and 2007 , said James Parrott , the chief economist of the Fiscal Policy Institute , quoting numbers from September ’s Brooklyn Labor Market Review from the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce .
In the same period , the number for manufacturers making products for mass markets declined by 48 percent .
Niche manufacturers currently make up a quarter of the more than 25,000 manufacturing jobs in Brooklyn , Mr. Parrott said .
No similar statistics were available for the rest of the city , which has a total of more than 92,000 manufacturing workers , he said .
The Ambassadors ( 1533 ) by Hans Holbein the Younger
The skull in this painting ( best seen standing to the right of it ) , hanging in the National Gallery in London is regarded as the most famous piece of anamorphic art , but the anamorphism is not immediately obvious and many people need to be told where to look to find it .
When the painting was first in the possession of the National Gallery , it took some years before anyone solved the puzzle of the " splodge " in the front of it , appearing to spoil an otherwise detailed painting .
Many sixteenth century European portraits include skulls as reminders of death

Until a few years ago , if you went to Vauxhall Rail station in London , you would see a mixture of images by the artist William Pye .
This image does n't make much sense , but the photographer of the next image was standing in the right place ( see next image ) .
If you stood in the correct place , you could see the British Rail logo .
Sadly these images no longer exist - Network Rail whitewashed them all out a couple of years ago .
This 17th - century oil painting by a Spanish artist was painted with slats sticking out of the base .
As you go past it , you see : Saint Francis of Assisi , Saint Francis de Paul and then Saint Peter .
You can find this painting in the Wellcome Collection .
The Hungarian graphic designer and artist Istvan Orosz is one of the leading exponents of anamorphosis today .
This public sculpture of a cylindrical mirror anamorphosis with a mosaic image will be created in Kitchener , Ontario next year .
It is a collaboration between the artist Allan MacKay and Professor James Hunt .
This artwork by Colin Wilbourn can be found in Sunderland , UK as an open air sculpture .
You have to sit in the right place to see it correctly ...
... as the person behind the camera here has done .
When viewed correctly , it shows a door .
This cone mirror anamorphosis of the scientist John Dalton , by the architect Andrew Compton , can be seen outside the Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester , UK .

The red light district has been popular for 700 years
Dutch authorities have revealed details of their plans to clean up Amsterdam 's famous red light district .
They say they will close half the city 's brothels , sex shops and marijuana cafes in a bid to drive organised crime from the city centre .
Council officials gave the sex industry a warning a year ago that they were going to close some brothels .
The deputy mayor of Amsterdam says the plans will stop the city being a " free zone " for criminals .
Last year the city said it wanted to close one - third of the red light district 's brothels , where scantily - clad prostitutes display themselves in shop windows .
But the new measures aim to reduce the number of sex " windows " from 482 to 243 , a council spokesman said .
Amsterdam also wants to close half of the 76 marijuana shops in the city centre .
City centre ' decay '
The city council says that some other businesses are also related to the decay of the city centre , including peep shows , sex shows , mini- supermarkets , phone and souvenir shops , and they will also be shut down .
You wo n't have to be embarrassed
Lodewijk Asscher
Deputy Mayor of Amsterdam
It says there are indications that some red light businesses serve as a cover for organised crime , including drugs and the trafficking of women .
" Money laundering , extortion and human trafficking are things you do not see on the surface but they are hurting people and the city .
We want to fight this , " said Deputy Mayor Lodewijk Asscher .
" We can still have sex and drugs but in a way that shows the city is in control . "
Officials have set aside some 39 m euros ( £ 33 m ) to bring back hotels , boutiques , galleries and restaurants to the area .
' Tolerant and crazy '
The plans come just days after a national ban on hallucinogenic or " magic mushrooms " from shops known as Smart Shops .
The BBC 's correspondent in the Netherlands , Geraldine Coughlan , says the latest plans go much further than had been expected .
Critics say the crackdown in Amsterdam is the latest example of a hardening of the traditional liberal Dutch approach to social issues including prostitution and soft drug use .
But Mr Asscher said that the changes would be more in line with Amsterdam 's image as a " tolerant and crazy place , rather than a free zone for criminals " .
" It will be a place with 200 windows ( for prostitutes ) and 30 coffee shops , which you can't find anywhere else in the world - very exciting , but also with cultural attractions , " he said , adding : " And you wo n't have to be embarrassed to say you came . "
Prostitution will be allowed only in two areas in the district - notably De Wallen , a web of streets and alleys around the city 's medieval retaining dam walls .
The area has been a centre of prostitution for hundreds of years .
Prostitution was legalised in the Netherlands in 2000 , formalising a long - standing tolerance .
Marijuana is technically illegal in the Netherlands , but prosecutors will not press charges for possession of small amounts .
Coffee shops are able to sell it openly .

Man beaten over bad performance of Dio song at karaoke bar

On November 7 , 2008 , Wisconsin resident Kyle Drinkwine became so enraged with the lackluster karaoke performance of a heavy metal song by Dio that he assaulted the singer and a second man at a local bar .
According to The Smoking Gun , Drinkwine throttled singer James Mischler , 28 , and his friend Cyrus Kozub , 29 , " over one 's ability to sing karaoke . "
Mischler was performing " Holy Diver , " the title cut on Dio 's 1983 debut album ( the band is fronted by Ronnie James Dio , the former Black Sabbath lead singer ) .
Following the assaults , police apprehended Drinkwine after a short foot chase .
A subsequent Breathalyzer test recorded his blood alcohol content at .169 , more than twice the state limit .
Drinkwine was booked into the Pierce County Jail on battery and disorderly conduct counts .
Suzanne Steeplton had worked for the Florida Transportation Bureau ( FTB ) for 36 years .
She was always on time , would work weekends and holidays when asked , and always had a smile on her face .
She was the perfect employee ; until now .
After 2 short hours of work on December 1st Steeplton was fired for handing out beer to every car that came through .
Although many drivers found this very entertaining and had no complaints , when a 16 year old brought home the beer to his mother , the mother was outraged and immediately called the FTB .
A Senior Representative drove up to Steepleton 's booth only to be greeted with a smile and handed an icy cold Bud .
While mildly amused , the representative closed Steepleton 's booth and brought her down to headquarters .
She was immediately fired and also arrested for distributing alcohol to a minor .
Steepleton claims her innocence and explained herself with the following statement :
I was participating in the required monthly Toll Booth Attendant 's conference where we learned December 's motto . "
At the age of 71 , Steepleton was a little hard of hearing and on this day she claims was having trouble with her hearing aids .
" I swear that I heard the speaker say the theme of the month was " Holiday Beer " , and even though I questioned what I heard I asked my good friend Edith Jones who was sitting next to me if that 's what he said .
Edith confirmed that the motto was " Holiday Beer " and that we were supposed to be extra pleasant while manning our booths .
As a bonus we were all told that whoever displayed the most holiday spirit in their toll booths and delivered the most holiday beer , would receive a brand new car .
As you can see I did exactly what I was told ! "
Although several people sympathized with her there was no way that she could keep her job but was let go with all her retirement benefits in tact .
As for the crime she faced , the prosecutor 's offered her a plea deal and she was given a small fine and probation .
It was also reported the the new Anheuser - Busch Company wants to use Steepleton in an upcoming holiday commercial where she will get to hand out beer to passers by in a make - shift toll booth placed in Times Square while dressed up as Mrs. Clause .

President Barack Obama says that multi-billion dollar bonuses taken by Wall Street bankers are " shameful " while taxpayers bail out their industry .
The president said their actions " were the height of irresponsibility " .
He said his administration would tell bankers they needed to show some discipline and restraint .
Mr Obama was responding to reports that employees at financial companies in New York collected an estimated $ 18.4 bn ( £ 12.9 bn ) in bonuses last year .
" It is shameful , and part of what we are going to need is for the folks on Wall Street who are asking for help to show some restraint and show some discipline and show some sense of responsibility , " he added .
" The American people understand that we have got a big hole we have got to dig ourselves out of but they do n't like the idea that people are digging a bigger hole . "
Earlier this week , US bank Citigroup cancelled an order for a new corporate jet after President Obama questioned the wisdom of the purchase .
The White House asked whether buying the jet was the " best use of money at this point " for a bank that took $ 45 bn ( £ 31.6 bn ) of public money last autumn .
Justin Silverton at Jaslabs has a supposed list of 10 tips for optimizing MySQL queries .
I could n't read this and let it stand because this list is really , really bad .
Some guy named Mike noted this , too .
So in this entry I 'll do two things : first , I 'll explain why his list is bad ; second , I 'll present my own list which , hopefully , is much better .
Onward , intrepid readers !
Some of his suggestions are just mind - boggling , e.g. , " remove unnecessary paratheses . "
It really does n't matter whether you do SELECT * FROM posts WHERE ( author_id = 5 AND published = 1 ) or SELECT * FROM posts WHERE author_id = 5 AND published = 1 .
None .
Any decent DBMS is going to optimize these away .
This level of detail is akin to wondering when writing a C program whether the post - increment or pre-increment operator is faster .
Really , if that 's where you 're spending your energy , it 's a surprise you 've written any code at all
There are cases when Mr. Silverton does note a good problem .
MySQL will indeed use a dynamic row format if it contains variable length fields like TEXT or BLOB , which , in this case , means sorting needs to be done on disk .
The solution is not to eschew these datatypes , but rather to split off such fields into an associated table .
The following schema represents this idea :
The rule in any situation where you want to opimize some code is that you first profile it and then find the bottlenecks .
Mr. Silverton , however , aims right for the tippy top of the trees .
I 'd say 60 % of database optimization is properly understanding SQL and the basics of databases .
You need to understand joins vs. subselects , column indices , how to normalize data , etc .
The next 35 % is understanding the performance characteristics of your database of choice .
COUNT (*) in MySQL , for example , can either be almost - free or painfully slow depending on which storage engine you 're using .
Other things to consider : under what conditions does your database invalidate caches , when does it sort on disk rather than in memory , when does it need to create temporary tables , etc .
The final 5 % , where few ever need venture , is where Mr. Silverton spends most of his time .
Never once in my life have I used SQL_SMALL_RESULT .
Let 's see if I fare any better .
I 'm going to start from the most general .
Benchmark , benchmark , benchmark !
You 're going to need numbers if you want to make a good decision .
What queries are the worst ?
Where are the bottlenecks ?
Under what circumstances am I generating bad queries ?
Benchmarking is will let you simulate high - stress situations and , with the aid of profiling tools , expose the cracks in your database configuration .
Tools of the trade include supersmack , ab , and SysBench .
These tools either hit your database directly ( e.g. , supersmack ) or simulate web traffic ( e.g. , ab ) .
Profile , profile , profile !
So , you 're able to generate high - stress situations , but now you need to find the cracks .
This is what profiling is for .
Profiling enables you to find the bottlenecks in your configuration , whether they be in memory , CPU , network , disk I/O , or , what is more likely , some combination of all of them .
The very first thing you should do is turn on the MySQL slow query log and install mtop .
This will give you access to information about the absolute worst offenders .
Have a ten - second query ruining your web application ?
These guys will show you the query right off .
After you 've identified the slow queries you should learn about the MySQL internal tools , like EXPLAIN , SHOW STATUS , and SHOW PROCESSLIST .
These will tell you what resources are being spent where , and what side effects your queries are having , e.g. , whether your heinous triple - join subselect query is sorting in memory or on disk .
Of course , you should also be using your usual array of command - line profiling tools like top , procinfo , vmstat , etc. to get more general system performance information .
Tighten Up Your Schema
Before you even start writing queries you have to design a schema .
Remember that the memory requirements for a table are going to be around #entries * size of a row .
Unless you expect every person on the planet to register 2.8 trillion times on your website you do not in fact need to make your user_id column a BIGINT .
Likewise , if a text field will always be a fixed length ( e.g. , a US zipcode , which always has a canonical representation of the form " XXXXX - XXXX " ) then a VARCHAR declaration just adds a superfluous byte for every row .
Some people poo-poo database normalization , saying it produces unecessarily complex schema .
However , proper normalization results in a minimization of redundant data .
Fundamentally that means a smaller overall footprint at the cost of performance — the usual performance / memory tradeoff found everywhere in computer science .
The best approach , IMO , is to normalize first and denormalize where performance demands it .
Your schema will be more logical and you wo n't be optimizing prematurely .
Partition Your Tables
Often you have a table in which only a few columns are accessed frequently .
On a blog , for example , one might display entry titles in many places ( e.g. , a list of recent posts ) but only ever display teasers or the full post bodies once on a given page .
Horizontal vertical partitioning helps : CREATE TABLE posts ( id int unsigned not null auto_increment , author_id int unsigned not null , title varchar ( 128 ) , created timestamp not null , PRIMARY KEY ( id ) ) ; CREATE TABLE posts_data ( post_id int unsigned not null , teaser text , body text , PRIMARY KEY ( post_id ) ) ;
The above represents a situation where one is optimizing for reading .
Frequently accessed data is kept in one table while infrequently accessed data is kept in another .
Since the data is now partitioned the infrequently access data takes up less memory .
You can also optimize for writing : frequently changed data can be kept in one table , while infrequently changed data can be kept in another .
This allows more efficient caching since MySQL no longer needs to expire the cache for data which probably has n't changed .
Do n't Overuse Artificial Primary Keys Artificial primary keys are nice because they can make the schema less volatile .
If we stored geography information in the US based on zip code , say , and the zip code system suddenly changed we'd be in a bit of trouble .
On the other hand , many times there are perfectly fine natural keys .
One example would be a join table for many - to - many relationships .
What not to do : CREATE TABLE posts_tags ( relation_id int unsigned not null auto_increment , post_id int unsigned not null , tag_id int unsigned not null , PRIMARY KEY ( relation_id ) , UNIQUE INDEX ( post_id , tag_id ) ) ;
Not only is the artificial key entirely redundant given the column constraints , but the number of post - tag relations are now limited by the system - size of an integer .
Instead one should do : CREATE TABLE posts_tags ( post_id int unsigned not null , tag_id int unsigned not null , PRIMARY KEY ( post_id , tag_id ) ) ;
Learn Your Indices
Often your choice of indices will make or break your database .
For those who have n't progressed this far in their database studies , an index is a sort of hash .
If we issue the query SELECT * FROM users WHERE last_name = ' Goldstein ' and last_name has no index then your DBMS must scan every row of the table and compare it to the string ' Goldstein . '
An index is usually a B - tree ( though there are other options ) which speeds up this comparison considerably .
You should probably create indices for any field on which you are selecting , grouping , ordering , or joining .
Obviously each index requires space proportional to the number of rows in your table , so too many indices winds up taking more memory .
You also incur a performance hit on write operations , since every write now requires that the corresponding index be updated .
There is a balance point which you can uncover by profiling your code .
This varies from system to system and implementation to implementation .
SQL is Not C C is the canonical procedural programming language and the greatest pitfall for a programmer looking to show off his database - fu is that he fails to realize that SQL is not procedural ( nor is it functional or object - oriented , for that matter ) .
Rather than thinking in terms of data and operations on data one must think of sets of data and relationships among those sets .
This usually crops up with the improper use of a subquery : SELECT a.id , ( SELECT MAX ( created ) FROM posts WHERE author_id = a.id ) AS latest_post FROM authors a Since this subquery is correlated , i.e. , references a table in the outer query , one should convert the subquery to a join .
SELECT a.id , MAX ( p.created ) AS latest_post FROM authors a INNER JOIN posts p ON ( a.id = p.author_id ) GROUP BY a.id
Understand your engines MySQL has two primary storange engines : MyISAM and InnoDB . Each has its own performance characteristics and considerations .
In the broadest sense MyISAM is good for read - heavy data and InnoDB is good for write - heavy data , though there are cases where the opposite is true .
The biggest gotcha is how the two differ with respect to the COUNT function .
MyISAM keeps an internal cache of table meta - data like the number of rows .
This means that , generally , COUNT (*) incurs no additional cost for a well - structured query .
InnoDB , however , has no such cache .
For a concrete example , let 's say we 're trying to paginate a query .
If you have a query SELECT * FROM users LIMIT 5,10 , let 's say , running SELECT COUNT (*)
FROM users LIMIT 5,10 is essentially free with MyISAM but takes the same amount of time as the first query with InnoDB.
MySQL has a SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS option which tells InnoDB to calculate the number of rows as it runs the query , which can then be retreived by executing SELECT FOUND_ROWS ( ) .
This is very MySQL - specific , but can be necessary in certain situations , particularly if you use InnoDB for its other features ( e.g. , row - level locking , stored procedures , etc. ) .
MySQL specific shortcuts MySQL provides many extentions to SQL which help performance in many common use scenarios .
Among these are INSERT ... SELECT , INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE , and REPLACE .
I rarely hesitate to use the above since they are so convenient and provide real performance benefits in many situations .
MySQL has other keywords which are more dangerous , however , and should be used sparingly .
These include INSERT DELAYED , which tells MySQL that it is not important to insert the data immediately ( say , e.g. , in a logging situation ) .
The problem with this is that under high load situations the insert might be delayed indefinitely , causing the insert queue to baloon .
You can also give MySQL index hints about which indices to use .
MySQL gets it right most of the time and when it does n't it is usually because of a bad scheme or poorly written query .
Goldberg speaks with Hisham Melhem , the reporter who interviewed Obama for al - Arabiya .
Melhem :
... in the long run , [ Obama ] is telling the Muslim world that it 's going to have a difficult time demonizing him .
He 's saying , " I 'm willing to disagree with the people of the Muslim world respectfully . "
He was miffed and angry by Zawahiri and Bin Laden , the way they speak of him .
And he jumped on it and dealt with it .
There 's a subtle shift here on how he looks at the war on al - Qaeda and the groups that collaborate with it .
He does n't put Hamas and Hezbollah in the same category as al - Qaeda .
Is there going to be disappointment later ?
We 're bound to have disappointments , but the main message is that a new wind is blowing .
He 's closing down Guantanamo , sending Mitchell , pulling out of Iraq , and maybe I 'm dreaming but I hope he would show Palestinians and Israelis tough love , both of them .
Do you want to tell me that Bin Laden and all these nuts are not going to be nervous about him ?
NEW YORK , Jan. 29 ( UPI ) --
A man has filed suit against his former employer , a New York currency trader , claiming his supervisor harassed him with ribbing about his " gay " vegetarianism .
Ryan Pacifico is seeking damages from Calyon in the Americas for " compensatory , emotional , physical and punitive damages , " the New York Post reported .

Pacifico said his relationship with his supervisor , Robert Catalanello , soured as soon as Catalanello discovered that Pacifico does not eat meat .
That occurred when Catalanello picked a steakhouse for a team - building dinner and another employee suggested a restaurant where Pacifico would be more comfortable .
Catalanello refused to change restaurants and said " Who the f --- cares ?
It 's his fault for being a vegetarian homo . "
In addition to verbal jibes , Catalanello would only order items containing meat for weekly team lunches , Pacifico alleged .
Pacifico was ultimately fired and said he was dismissed for a minor violation of the rules that he claimed was a cover for the real reason .

Regardless of where you believe to be the true “ Happiest Place On Earth ” is , you have to admit , Disneyland is at least pretty magical .
It 's so magical , in fact , that even after 50 years and over 500 million of visitors , there are still tons of secrets hidden in and about the Magical Kingdom .
1. Disneyland was expected to fail .
2 . Need a real drink ?
3. Tomorrow Land is so outdated .
4 . There 's a Disney Underground .
5. Olympic sports anyone ?
6 . It 's safe , but not 100 % safe .
7 . Ever feel like you 're being watched ?
8. A ghostly Hazmat problem .
9 . A pirate 's life for Jack .
10 . Words from beyond .
A few other fun tidbits :
Steve Martin used to work in the magic shop here .
There used to be live girls dressed like mermaids in the 2000 Leagues Under the Sea pool .
Did your balloon pop ?
Just show any balloon seller your popped balloon and they 'll give you a new one .
The Imagineers put special touches everywhere .
The Haunted Mansion features faces of a few of the early Imagineers and has tombstones written with inside joke references .
Coke gives the park free soda to eliminate competition in the park and for the advertising .
Hidden Mickeys are spread all over the park and there 's at least one in every ride .
Opening day was such a disaster that pretty much every press organization that attended the celebration had predicted the park 's failure within one year .
It opened on a day that was 101 degrees and the street asphalt still was n't dry , leading to it sticking to shoes .
By the end of the first day , all but 2 of the 48 Autopia cars were crashed and about half the rides were broken .
Despite all that , park visitors loved it and attendance continued to grow day by day .
Source ( Photo : Thomas Fredrick [ Flickr ] ) While many Disney fanatics may already know this one , others may find it surprising to know there is exactly one place in the entire park that serves alcoholic beverages .
The place is called Club 33 and it is a very exclusive club to get in .
To gain entry , there is a ten year waiting list and admission is at least a thousand dollars .
Supposedly , the food is good though .

Or at least , the first version is by now .
The only Tomorrow Land ride that still exists in its original state from the opening is Autopia , and even it was changed to fit with Cars the movie .
Actually though , there is one major change in Autopia from how it was on opening day - there were originally no guide rail to keep people on track .
Sometimes Disney was a little too trusting of the good of humans .

It 's not quite as exciting as it sounds though .
Despite rumors , the area under the park is n't a massive underground city .
There are many underground basements though , where cast can relax , change in and out of costumes and eat lunch in peace .
Think of it like a few really big break rooms .
Disney World on the other hand , was built late enough that they have a full city underground .
Photo : Frikitiki [ Flickr ] Just walking around the park over and over again is exercise enough for most people , but employees have the option of working out in the Matterhorn .
Surely you did n't think that huge mountain was only used for one little ride did you ?
No , the Matterhorn is officially classified as a gym and has a full basketball court inside .
In 1984 , it was even certified as an official Olympic Stadium .

Despite persisting urban legends that claim no one ever died in the park , people have .
At least 12 people have died there , reports vary as to whether some additional death tales are true or not .
All things considered though , 12 deaths in over 50 years is n't that bad .
Keep in mind , aside from dangerous rides , there is also a notable amount of gang violence at other Southern California amusement parks that does n't occur as frequently at Disneyland .
You might be .
There are cameras everywhere .
Aside from average security brigades , they even have special tasks forces with only a handful of things to focus on .
There are at least two special forces at the park , one dedicated to catching people using drugs at the park , and another dedicated to catching people who flash or flip off the cameras during the photo parts of the rides .
If you 've ever gotten a message saying your photo is n't available when you got off the ride , there 's a good chance someone either flashed some breast or flipped the bird to the camera .

There are many reports of people trying to spill the ashes of loved ones in the Haunted Mansion .
As nice of a thought as it is , there are plenty of ghosts in the Mansion already and if everyone dumped their ashes here , then the whole thing would be covered in dust .
So , every time it happens , the Mansion needs to be closed and a hazmat team cleans it .
We all know that Johnny Depp is dang sexy , but just the character of Jack Sparrow ?
Apparently , a lot of women still think he 's just as good as Depp .
In Pirate 's Booty , an ex-actor at Disneyland confessed how many women would try to hump him just for playing the character .
The stories range from flirting to receiving napkins with naughty offers .
( Photo : Locket479 [ Flickr ] ) Ever notice the telegraph clicking at the New Orleans ' train station ?
It 's ticking out the speech Disney gave out on the park 's opening day .
Traces of Disney are all over the park , my favorite one though is his old apartment over the fire house on Main Street .
They always leave the light on in his memory .
Not only is it cute , but it 's also rad that he got to live in the park .

Sound is the new frontier for Flash as Adobe Systems released its first major update in three years today , packing in features missing from May 's first beta .
Flash Player 10 will deliver sound file features that go someway towards giving developers working on audio the same powers of content creation and customization as video .
Adobe has added the ability to read audio files ' binary data and directly access the sound buffer to add the sounds filters you really want .
The company said it 's putting the creation and editing of audio content on a par with video , by giving creatives the power to build and edit sound files rather than use what 's in the box .
" Developers had n't been able to make sounds as dynamic as they could other parts of Flash , " Adobe platform senior product manager Justin Everett - Church said .
The version of Flash Player 10 unveiled in May focused on customization in graphics .
These features - delivered with today 's release - included a Just In Time ( JIT ) engine to load pixel bytecode into the Player engine , so that users could create their own graphics and effects rendering filters , and Adobe Pixel Bender to let users build pixel files and filters .
Adobe cited feedback from the beta community for extending the customization features to audio .
It 's interesting , though , that Flash Player 10 comes as Microsoft increases the pressure on Adobe with its own media player - the browser plug - in Silverlight .
In what must surely qualify as an attempt to overshadow Flash Player 10 , Microsoft announced Tuesday the release of its latest version of Silverlight - version 2.0 .
Microsoft wrapped the Silverlight 2.0 news with the announcement it 's funding a project at the open - source Eclipse Foundation to build open - source tools for Java .
Also , Microsoft is releasing controls under its Open Source Initiative ( OSI ) - approved open - source license and releasing its XAML documentation under the company 's Open - Specification Promise ( OSP ) .
Everett - Church said it was important to respond to community requests for Flash 10 very quickly .
" We want to keep them [ developers ] happy with our technology , " he said .
He also took issue with Silverlight 's cross-platform credentials , and Microsoft 's attempts to rally the open - source community behind its player .
He pointed to the fact that tools for Flash Player run on Windows and Mac - whereas Microsoft 's tools are only on Windows .
Adobe is also a member of Eclipse , whereas Microsoft is providing tactical backing for only certain projects . ®

Season Wrap Up
The Angels no doubt have the blue print for making the playoffs memorized .
The only problem is that in the past few seasons , when they get there , they are unable to get out of the Divisional round where they were the victim of the Boston Red Sox this season in just four games .
General manager Tony Reagins has to be frustrated with the recent lack of success in the post season because it seems like he has all of the pieces for a deep October run during the season .
With the Angels leading the major leagues with 100 wins in 2008 , it seemed like they were at least destined for the ALCS , but the Sox had too much October experience for them to take down .
The team received the most nation - wide press during the season for the record breaking performance of closer Francisco Rodriguez .
K- Rod , who is currently a free agent , broke the major league record with 62 saves .
Obviously , to win 100 games , the team was doing things right in all aspects of the game .
The interesting thing will be to see how they decide to fine tune an already deep team this off season .
Holes to Fill
Depending on what the team decides to do with their own free agent outfielders , they will probably have to look for some talent in that area .
There does n’t seem to be any talent at the AAA level that would be ready to come up to compete for an outfield position just yet , so that probably means they will have to bring in at least one player for a corner outfield position ( probably left field ) that was n’t on the team last season .
The Angels may have an upper hand in this area because many teams are going to be looking for corner outfielders this off season ( perhaps the biggest position besides pitchers ) , but the Halos have shown that they are willing to spend money to get talent , evidenced by their sixth ranked $ 119.2 million payroll last season .
Adding another arm to the starting rotation would n’t hurt either .
While their pitching was one of the best in the majors last season , some depth at this spot has never hurt anyone .
It currently looks like they are probably not going to resign K - Rod unless he is willing to take some sort of home town discount .
This would mean that the Angels will have the position of closer open .
Spending on closers ( and other relievers ) on the open market is always risky business as they often have one good year and one off year due to their usage .
Due to this fact , the team may try to fill the closer roll internally as they have a few arms they believe may be able to take the spot .
Free Agents
At the beginning of the off season , the Angels had eight players who could have entered free agency including outfielders Vladimir Guerrero , Garret Anderson and Jaun Rivera , pitchers Rodriguez , John Lackey and Jon Garland and first baseman Mark Teixeira .
The Angels have already made the decisions on some of these players as they have picked up the 2009 club options for Guerrero and Lackey , while also declining the option on Anderson .
Due to this fact , it is almost a lock that Anderson will not be back for this Los Angeles team next season ( leaving the hole in left field mentioned earlier ) .
Teixeira is no doubt their number one in house priority this off season .
A lot of what they do during the rest of the off season will depend on whether or not they are able to work out a deal with the first baseman who they acquired at the trade deadline .
The team has made some serious bids to free agent pitcher CC Sabathia and since he seems to want to play on the west coast , they have a serious shot of landing him ( written pre-signing with the Yankees ) .
The Outlook
It is very realistic to see the Angels repeating as division winners once again , especially if they are able to land Teixeira and Sabathia in the off season .
Whether these two players would give them the push that they have recently been lacking in the post season is yet to be seen ( especially due to the fact that Sabathia has been less than stellar during the past two post seasons with the Indians and Brewers ) .
Manager Mike Scioscia is probably one of the more respectable managers in the game at this point and has shown that he knows how to handle having a lot of big egos on his team during the 162 game season .
The Halos will probably look for takers for outfielder Gary Matthews Jr. during the off season , which would open up yet another spot in the outfield .
Even though Matthews is a quality player and has three years left on his current deal , he has not been able to get along with the team ’s management since coming to Anaheim as a free agent two seasons ago and all of this makes him expandable at the right price .
If they are able to pick - up some extra offense this off season , they could realistically improve on their runs scored ranking which was tenth in 2008 at 765 .
With all of the fire power the team has , it ’s some what surprising that it was not higher than that , although it did receive a jump at mid-season when Teixeira was acquired from the Braves .
Part of that low scoring total could have been the fact that they really did n’t need to score a whole lot because their starting pitching was so stellar throughout the season with Lackey and youngster Ervin Santana both making bids for the Cy Young Award .
Winning 100 games is a tough thing to do , and even tougher to repeat , but if the Angels are willing to spend the money to land the free agents they seem to be eying this off season , having a goal of exceeding 100 regular season wins would not seem out of the ordinary .

I t's kind of hard to keep saying that " smart is the new sexy , " given how many times we 've seen the brainy girl slip off her spectacles , let down her hair , and miraculously turn into a goddess beyond compare .
Still ,
It 's fair to say that Tina Fey 's success with " 30 Rock " -- both as the star and the creator of the show -- has done wonders to raise the prominence of the intelligent - and - beautiful blend of woman .
Liz Lemon is n't alone in her field today , what with Dr. Lisa Cuddy turning heads and saving lives on " House , " and when you look back and examine their spiritual ancestors , you find that there have been plenty of gorgeous geniuses on the airwaves in the past .
Now 's your chance to select which one of them you 'd prefer to have getting inside your head … and elsewhere .
So spend some time with our 10 " Hot & Smart " nominees below , carefully considering all of their ... um , qualifications .
Is the aforementioned Ms. Lemon tops among the beautiful and brainy , or does someone outshine her ?
Perhaps a certain blonde secretary for a Cincinnati - based radio station is worthy of your vote , or one of several nominees from the medical profession ?
Check out our TV Girlfriends home page to see all the other categories we had in this feature , and then check out who won each category and which character our readers chose as the ultimate TV Girlfriend .
Dr. Lisa Cuddy
Lisa Edelstein , " House "
Those skirts !
Those sweaters !
You would n't necessarily expect a hospital administrator , let alone a Dean of Medicine at a teaching hospital , to embrace such form - fitting fashions as those favored by Dr. Lisa Cuddy , but there 's rarely an occasion when this formidable woman does n't opt to spotlight her equally formidable figure .
But do n't let her looks fool you : Dr. Cuddy has a brilliant medical mind , and although she may not always be able to compete with the inestimable genius of her fellow physician , Dr. Gregory House , she 's plenty capable when it comes to doling out diagnoses and performing surgeries .
Be aware , however , that Dr. Cuddy has a nasty case of baby fever , so as a girlfriend , you may find that she 'll be interested in moving things along in the relationship a bit more quickly than you 'd prefer .
Then again , if you can get Dr. House to tell you about the strip tease she did for him in his drug - addled fantasy ( three words : Catholic schoolgirl outfit ) , you may be fully prepared to provide Cuddy with the child she 's always wanted .
Do n't miss our 2006 interview with actress Lisa Edelstein !
Liz Lemon
Tina Fey , " 30 Rock "
With her quirky sense of humor , social ineptness and those sexy librarian glasses , Liz Lemon may be the only true - blue nerd on our list .
That , of course , is anything but an insult .
As the head writer for NBC's " TGS with Tracy Jordan , " Liz does n't have a whole lot of free time to date , and even when she does go out , chances are she 'll figure out a way to sabotage the whole thing .
But Liz 's foibles merely make her that much more endearing , even if the incessant " tick - tick - tick " of her internal clock understandably makes us a little nervous .
Then again , there are worse things in life than settling down with an attractive , intelligent and successful woman who loves junk food , " Star Wars " and a good joke .
Her boss , Jack Donaghy , still suspects that Liz may be a lesbian , but we 're not ashamed to admit that the mere possibility only heightens our interest in her .
Plus , she kind of looks like the beautiful ( if slightly crazy ) Sarah Palin .
Jennifer Marlowe
Loni Anderson , " WKRP in Cincinnati "
She 's fallen head over heels once or twice , and her doorbell plays " Fly Me to the Moon , " but the world 's most respected receptionist is no romantic .
Curvaceous and wasp - wasted enough to compare to a Barbie doll and smart enough to be offered the position of Secretary of the Treasury ( literally ) , Jennifer Marlowe 's dating preferences lean toward well - to - do older men with names like " The Admiral " ; she enjoys their generosity as well as their tendency to " tire easily . "
Indeed , Ms. Marlowe seems to get most of her emotional satisfaction from her job , where her beauty , intelligence , and self - possession have rendered her a benign despot – dictating her salary , her ( limited ) duties , and whatever else she wants to dictate .
As the utterly platonic office wife to her ineffectual mama 's boy boss , Arthur Carlson , and a very sexy big sister to everyone else , she resolves disputes while having zero problem keeping would - be wolves like salesman Herb Tarlek at howling distance .
Sure , she occasionally provides romantic inspiration , though not much more , to potentially more suitable boyfriends like station manager Andy Travis and star DJ Dr. Johnny Fever , but that 's as far as it goes .
Yes , she'd be an amazing girlfriend or wife to any man – but is any man good enough ?
Lisa Miller
Maura Tierney , " NewsRadio "
So what if she 's a news reporter for one of the lowest - rated news radio stations in New York ; it is rare for Lisa Miller to not be the smartest person in the room , and Lisa wields that knowledge -- and her awareness of that knowledge -- both as a sword and a fierce source of pride .
She 'll even break the law in the interest of advancing said knowledge ( she stole a car at 17 because she did n't want to be late to take the SAT . )
Funny , then , that for someone so intelligent , Lisa seems to be completely unaware of how pretty she is ; she thinks that she 's special , sure , but she has no idea that she is in fact spectacular .
Or perhaps she 's just bluffing on that last point ; this is , after all , the same girl that used her game face to win back news anchor Bill McNeal after WNYX owner Jimmy James lost him in a poker game .
( She had a pair of sixes , by the way . )
Rare is the girl that is smart , modest , good but willing to be bad , and mysterious .
If she were ours , we could n't bring her home to meet Mom fast enough .
Dr. Dana Scully
Gillian Anderson , " The X - Files "
Smart , tough , beautiful – Scully is an insecure man 's worst nightmare .
She challenged and contradicted Mulder at every turn , and even though she was usually some version of wrong , it never deterred her .
Always the skeptic , she somewhat grounded her partner by demanding some sort of logic and scientific proof .
Wrangling Mulder was like herding cats , but Scully might have had a little feline in her as well – she avoided death on several occasions leading to the theory that she was , in fact , immortal .
It 's more likely that she was just too stubborn to die .
She stared down countless psychopaths , supernatural beings , aliens -- you name it -- and always came back for more .
This quality -- her fierce and undying loyalty -- was her greatest trait .
True , the woman could be a giant pain in the ass , but Fox always knew that she would have his back , and that 's why he eventually fell in love with her .
And really , who can blame him ?
The first five nominees in the " Hot and Smart " category are all worthy objects of our affection , but they certainly are n't the only TV braniacs to win our hearts .
Below you 'll find five more lovely ladies to consider before placing your vote for Bullz - Eye 's " Hot and Smart " TV Girlfriend .
Winifred " Fred " Burkle
Amy Acker , " Angel "
Only in our wildest dreams were our math or science teachers this adorable .
Smart as a whip and humble to boot -- good luck getting her to brag about herself , ever -- Fred Burkle is so irresistible that every one of her co-workers , from the lab techs to the muscle men , harbored some sort of crush on her .
( One of those crushes proved to be fatal , but let 's not talk about that right now . )
You 'll forgive her if she seems a little nuts from time to time ; spending five years in the alternate universe of Pylea as a " cow " ( read : human slave ) will do that to a person .
And did we mention the Texas accent ?
Swoon .
Carol Hathaway
Julianna Margulies , " ER "
Guys love sexy nurses .
They take care of you when you need help , and the hot ones manage to look great even when wearing ugly scrubs .
With her piercing eyes and long , curly black hair , Carol Hathaway certainly fit the bill .
She was also a no - nonsense nurse who did n't let doctors or patients push her around .
Unfortunately , you 'd have to battle Clooney to get her attention .
Colleen McMurphy
Dana Delany , " China Beach "
If you 're a nurse near the front lines in Vietnam , you have to be tough and smart .
If you 're also hot , you can count on most patients falling for you .
Colleen McMurphy was a sexy Irish tomboy with a great sense of humor who looked fantastic regardless of the circumstances .
She was also a great example of the heroic role played by so many nurses during wartime .
Seven of Nine
Jeri Ryan , " Star Trek : Voyager "
She may have the emotional range of a brick wall , but if there 's one cyborg we'd like to have an hour on the holodeck with , it 's Seven of Nine .
Sure , she was n't always the prettiest girl in the galaxy -- her time spent with the Borg Collective kept her too busy to worry about personal hygiene -- but by the time she was brought on board the Voyager , cleaned up , and put in a skintight silver catsuit , she was the object of more than just one crewmember 's affection .
Her intelligence may be the result of an artificial implant , but her body is all natural .
Christine Sullivan
Markie Post , " Night Court "
Yeah , she had a mullet .
But you know what that means -- even if crusading attorney Christine Sullivan was all business in the front , she knew how to party in the back .
Of course , loosening her inhibitions was easier said than done , as John Larroquette 's lecherous Dan Fielding repeatedly discovered during the show 's eight - year run , and who could blame him for trying ?
Smart and career - driven , Christine was everything an ' 80s woman was supposed to be -- and she was also as blonde and curvy as any randomly chosen centerfold from the decade , giving " approaching the bench " a whole new meaning for " Night Court " fans who knew how to appreciate a nice set of legal briefs .

More than half said they were not in love with their first partner , and only one in three believe it is important to be in love with someone before going to bed with them .
I ’m still mulling over everything I saw at the Consumer Electronics Show , but I know what my sleeper hit is : Sixense ’s TrueMotion game controller , which I saw demoed at the meeting room of chipmaker Analog Devices , which supplies some of the technology the controller uses .
It looks very much like Nintendo ’s Wiimote and the basic idea is the same .
But TrueMotion uses a base station that creates an electromagnetic field to provide much , much , much more precision than the Wiiremote .
It does n’t just know the general direction you ’ve moved the remote–it can tell exactly where it is and what angle you ’re holding it at .
End result :
You can manipulate on - screen objects in a way that feels dramatically more real than on the Wii .
I could go on , but Sixense ’s video demo shows this better than I can explain it–although TrueMotion is even more impressive when you try it yourself than it is in this clip :
Sixense says that TrueMotion will work with existing games as well as ones designed specifically to take advantage of its capabilities .
It expects TrueMotion - based controllers for PCs to ship by Christmas , one controller and base station bundled with a game will go for under $ 100 .

Britain 's environmental movement was yesterday presented with its starkest choice yet : whether or not to support the world 's largest - ever renewable energy project which will result in unprecedented ecological damage to one of our most important natural habitats .
The giant £ 20 bn Severn barrage , which would stretch 10 miles from Lavernock Point near Cardiff to Brean Down near Weston - super - Mare , would harness the tides to generate up to 5 per cent of the UK 's electricity needs – the equivalent of eight typical coal - fired power stations .
This is crucially important in the fight against climate change .
But environmentalists fear that by blocking the Severn estuary completely , the barrage would destroy vast areas of mudflats and mashes , which are vital feeding grounds for tens of thousands of wading birds , and prevent migratory fish such as salmon and eels from ascending rivers to spawn .
Other environmentalists think such a large project would divert resources away from other key renewable technologies such as wind power .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Yesterday the barrage appeared on a shortlist of five renewable energy schemes for the Severn estuary indicating that the project , which the Government is known to favour , is moving closer to formal acceptance .
The shortlist will now be the subject of a public consultation and a final decision will be taken by 2010 .
But the proposal is causing real difficulties for Britain 's green movement , whose members are united in the need to take action against global warming , yet view with deep dismay the unprecedented ecological damage a Severn barrage would undoubtedly bring about .
The dilemma could not be more acute : on the one hand , the prospect of more renewable energy from one place than is currently produced in the entire UK ; on the other , the virtual wiping out of one of Britain 's most important wildlife sites .
The dilemma will only increase as the imperative of countering climate change with major developments runs up against the damage to the natural world which such large - scale schemes may cause .
The Government 's official green advisers , the Sustainable Development Commission , thinks the barrage should be built if it can pass two tests : that new wildlife habitats can be created to compensate for those lost and that the project remains in public ownership .
The SDC favours it because with the Severn having the second highest tidal range in the world – the difference between high and low tides can be as much as 45ft – the energy - producing potential of a barrage is enormous , capable of generating more than eight gigawatts of power .
However , Friends of the Earth believe it would simply be too damaging and divert too much money that could be better spent fighting climate change in other ways .
Greenpeace agrees it has potential but thinks the Government should give priority to wind power .
The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds , the Wildlife Trusts and the Government 's own wildlife watchdog , Natural England , are all concerned over the impact on wildlife .
" It is hugely disappointing to see the Government still pushing forward with the environmentally destructive option of a Cardiff - Weston barrage , " said Martin Harper , the RSPB 's head of sustainable development .
" Climate change threatens an environmental catastrophe for humans and wildlife and we urgently need to find low and zero carbon alternatives to our insatiable appetite for fossil fuels , so harnessing the huge tidal power of the Severn has to be right .
But it can not be right to trash the natural environment in the process .
The final scheme must be the one that generates as much clean energy as possible while minimising harm to the estuary and its wildlife .
We know the Cardiff - Weston Barrage would destroy huge areas of estuary marsh and mudflats used by 69,000 birds each winter and block the migration routes of countless fish . "
Natural England 's chief executive Helen Phillips said yesterday : " Tackling climate change requires us to make a step change in the way we think about renewable energy but we have to ensure that the decisions we make stand the test of time and do not leave a legacy of environmental destruction in their wake . "
There is little doubt that a barrage would destroy more wildlife habitat than any other British construction project in modern times .
The Severn Estuary , where the celebrated naturalist Sir Peter Scott founded Slimbridge , the wildfowl refuge which became one of the world 's most famous nature reserves , provides an 86,000 - acre feeding ground for wild swans , geese and many thousands of wading birds , such as dunlin , turnstone , oystercatcher and ringed plover , from all over Europe .
Under EU wildlife habitat laws , if the Government were to go ahead , it would have to find alternative compensatory habitat – mudflats and marshes – which might be as much as 40,000 acres , and which might cost anything up to £ 3bn .
But that is unlikely to hold the Government back , such will be the temptation to grab that massive 5 per cent renewable energy boost from a barrage – for in December ministers took on the enormous obligation , in an EU - wide deal , of sourcing 20 per cent of total UK energy demand from renewables by 2020 .
Twenty per cent of total energy ( which includes heating and transport ) means finding about 40 per cent of electricity from renewables – nearly 10 times the current figure of about 4.5 per cent .
The Herculean size of that task means the Government is very likely to go for the barrage , especially as the onshore wind industry is suffering strongly from the rise in the euro against the pound , meaning turbines made in Germany and Denmark are now about a third dearer than they were a year ago .
Apart from the main barrage , four other shortlisted schemes were announced by the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change , David Miliband , yesterday .
They are : Shoots barrage , further upstream which would generate around 1GW ; Beachley barrage , an even smaller scheme just above the river Wye , which would generate around 625 MW ; Bridgwater Bay lagoon , a proposal which would impound a section of the estuary on the coast from east of Hinkley Point to Weston - super - Mare , which could generate 1.36GW and Fleming lagoon , a similar scheme which would generate the same amount of power from a section of the Welsh shore between Newport and the Severn road crossings .
Mr Miliband acknowledged fighting climate change involved " tough choices " and said : " The five schemes shortlisted are what we believe can be feasible but this does n't mean we have lost sight of others .
Half a million pounds of new funding will go some way to developing technologies still in their infancy , like tidal reefs and fences .
We will consider the progress of this work before any final decisions are taken . "
Is it the right decision to build the barrage ?
Andrew Lee : Yes
Climate science is telling us that we will have to reduce our carbon emissions to near zero by 2050 , if the rest of the world is to have any chance to develop at all , so we must take all options for Severn tidal power very seriously indeed .
In our report Turning the Tide , the SDC felt that a Cardiff - Weston barrage could be sustainable if it passed two tough tests .
The first is EU law : breaching the habitats and birds directives would set a dangerous precedent .
The second is the public interest – we said that any scheme must be publicly managed and owned .
The barrage is a player for 2050 , as are the newly emerging tidal fence and tidal reef technologies which might have less environmental impact .
Ironically , a smaller scheme could also have significant environmental impact , while being too small to help much in the energy mix and hived off entirely to the private sector to boot .
Andrew Lee is chief executive of the Sustainable Development Commission
Gordon James : No
For the amount of energy produced , a Severn barrage would be too damaging to the ecological features and species of international importance in the estuary – even given that climate change and sea - level rise would be gradually affecting habitats .
At a cost of around £ 15 bn it would be uneconomic , and public funds for " climate mitigation " projects could be better spent generating more energy in a shorter period of time from alternative renewable and or low - carbon schemes .
The barrage would preclude the building of large tidal lagoon impoundments and other tidal schemes in the Severn estuary from Bridgwater Bay eastwards , which may amount to considerable electricity and storage potential , and it would generate large amounts of electricity in two pulses of around four hours each day , which would not necessarily match high demand , and create problems for the national grid .

The Motion Picture Association of America ( MPAA ) has supplied its political wish list to the Obama transition team , and thanks to new transition team policies , that means the MPAA has shared its agenda with everyone on the Internet .
" Graduated response " rules are praised , anti-camcording rules are paramount , and Canada and Spain are two of the countries that need to be singled out for " priority trade policy attention . "
The Obama transition team is publicizing its meetings with interest groups and putting any materials provided to the team up on the change.gov web site .
The MPAA document is a mere one - pager that outlines the group 's international agenda , but it does give us a good sense of what an MPAA - run world would look like .
The group wants the US government to continue pressuring other countries on camcording in theaters , which it calls the " major source of pirated motion pictures . "
Free trade agreements with countries like Korea and Malaysia have recently included such provisions , forcing the countries to alter their laws or penalties for camcording before gaining better access to the US market .
The MPAA wants to see this trend continue in trade agreements ( no doubt including the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement under negotiation at the moment ) , and the group is especially concerned about Mexico , where camcording has reached " crisis proportions . "
But the truly interesting bits come further down the page .
In the section on Internet piracy , the MPAA understandably claims that such piracy is a top priority , and it wants to see " inter - industry cooperation " in the matter .
Fair enough , but what sort of cooperation is envisioned .
" MPAA views recent efforts by the Governments of France and the United Kingdom to protect content on - line and facilitate inter-industry cooperation as useful models , " says the document .
The reference is to the hugely controversial " graduated response " plans that the music industry , in particular , has pushed hard for in Europe .
" Useful models " suggests that MPAA would not be averse to seeing something similar in the US , though it 's difficult to imagine an Obama administration passing tough " three strikes " rules in the near future .
Blame Canada
The other controversial bit comes right at the end , when the MPAA offers up its 2009 country blacklist : Canada , China , India , Mexico , Russia , and Spain .
Canada is n't normally thought of as a piracy haven , but it has been on the hit list of IP groups for some time ; even video game companies have demanded that the country take action to crack down on pirates .
That irritates Canadians like Michael Geist , the law professor who helped lead the charge this year against an industry - friendly overhaul of copyright law .
The MPAA document " makes it clear that the copyright lobby groups will continue to blame Canada , despite the fact that Canada is compliant with its international obligations , " he writes .
" Claiming that Canadian law is akin to China or Russia ought to be dismissed outright , yet the ease with which the Canadian government caved to pressure on the camcording issue has apparently emboldened the same lobby group to demand even more . "
Giving hope to the MPAA may be news that Rep. Xavier Becerra ( D - CA ) , who ( literally ) represents Hollywood in Congress , could be tapped as the new US Trade Representative .
( USTR is also overseeing the ACTA process . )
Ed Black of the Computer & Communications Industry Association demands that whoever get the job " leave existing parochial , corporate or constituent interests behind now that his or her new constituency is the American public ...
Browbeating our trading partners to ratchet up IP protection or face trade sanctions has alienated our friends ...
While a ' what 's good for Disney must be good for America ' approach to IP foreign policy may once have made sense , it now impedes efforts to repair our international relationships . "
Making such lobbying documents public may not produce any substantive changes in how business in Washington gets done , but it certainly generates more public scrutiny of the various interest groups that plead their cases before the President - Elect .
In the case of the MPAA , some of those public reactions have been ... strong .
" It 's time to stop this madness , and President - elect Obama should treat these fleecers of the American consumer with the utmost contempt , " says one .
" Any actions as their lapdog enforcer would severely diminish my respect of his administration . "
Illustrating the power of submillimetre - wavelength astronomy , an APEX telescope image reveals how an expanding bubble of ionised gas about ten light - years across is causing the surrounding material to collapse into dense clumps that are the birthplaces of new stars .
Submillimetre light is the key to revealing some of the coldest material in the universe , such as these cold , dense clouds .
The region , called RCW120 , is about 4200 light years from Earth , towards the constellation of Scorpius .
A hot , massive star in its centre is emitting huge amounts of ultraviolet radiation , which ionises the surrounding gas , stripping the electrons from hydrogen atoms and producing the characteristic red glow of so - called H - alpha emission .
As this ionised region expands into space , the associated shock wave sweeps up a layer of the surrounding cold interstellar gas and cosmic dust .
This layer becomes unstable and collapses under its own gravity into dense clumps , forming cold , dense clouds of hydrogen where new stars are born .
However , as the clouds are still very cold , with temperatures of around - 250° Celsius , their faint heat glow can only be seen at submillimetre wavelengths .
Submillimetre light is therefore vital in studying the earliest stages of the birth and life of stars .
The submillimetre - wavelength data were taken with the LABOCA camera on the 12-m Atacama Pathfinder Experiment ( APEX ) telescope , located on the 5000 m high plateau of Chajnantor in the Chilean Atacama desert .
Thanks to LABOCA 's high sensitivity , astronomers were able to detect clumps of cold gas four times fainter than previously possible .
Since the brightness of the clumps is a measure of their mass , this also means that astronomers can now study the formation of less massive stars than they could before .
The plateau of Chajnantor is also where ESO , together with international partners , is building a next generation submillimetre telescope , ALMA , the Atacama Large Millimeter / submillimeter Array .
ALMA will use over sixty 12 - m antennas , linked together over distances of more than 16 km , to form a single , giant telescope .
APEX is a collaboration between the Max - Planck - Institute for Radio Astronomy ( MPIfR ) , the Onsala Space Observatory ( OSO ) and ESO .
The telescope is based on a prototype antenna constructed for the ALMA project .
Operation of APEX at Chajnantor is entrusted to ESO .
Consort of George III and Queen Victoria 's grandmother
Queen Charlotte , wife of the English King George III ( 1738 - 1820 ) , was directly descended from Margarita de Castro y Sousa , a black branch of the Portuguese Royal House .
The riddle of Queen Charlotte 's African ancestry was solved as a result of an earlier investigation into the black magi featured in 15th century Flemish paintings .
Two art historians had suggested that the black magiC must have been portraits of actual contemporary people ( since the artist , without seeing them , would not have been aware of the subtleties in colouring and facial bone structure of quadroons or octoroons which these figures invariably represented )
Enough evidence was accumulated to propose that the models for the black magi were , in all probability , members of the Portuguese de Sousa family .
Six different lines can be traced from English Queen Charlotte back to Margarita de Castro y Sousa , in a gene pool which because of royal inbreeding was already minuscule , thus explaining the Queen 's unmistakable African appearance .
The Negroid characteristics of the Queen 's portraits certainly had political significance since artists of that period were expected to play down , soften or even obliterate " undesirable " features in a subject 's face .
Sir Allan Ramsay was the artist responsible for the majority of the paintings of the Queen and his representations of her were the most decidedly African of all her portraits .
Ramsey was an anti-slavery intellectual of his day .
He also married the niece of Lord Mansfield , the English judge whose 1772 decision was the first in a series of rulings that finally ended slavery in the British Empire .
It should be noted too that by the time Sir Ramsay was commissioned to do his first portrait of the Queen , he was already , by marriage , uncle to Dido Elizabeth Lindsay .
Thus , from just a cursory look at the social awareness and political activism at that level of English society , it would be surprising if the Queen 's Negroid physiognomy was of no significance to the Abolitionist movement .
Perhaps the most literary of these allusions to her African appearance , however , can be found in the poem penned to her on the occasion of her wedding to George III and the Coronation celebration that immediately followed .
Descended from the warlike Vandal race , she still preserves that title in her face .
Tho ' shone their triumphs o'er Numidia 's plain , And Alusian fields their name retain ; they but subdued the southern world with arms ,
She conquers still with her triumphant charms , O ! born for rule , - to whose victorious brow The greatest monarch of the north must bow !
Who the Author of this Production is , is wholly unnecessary to the Public , as the Object for Attention is the DOCTRINE ITSELF , not the MAN .
Yet it may not be unnecessary to say , That he is unconnected with any Party , and under no sort of Influence public or private , but the influence of reason and principle
SCALE Organizers Call For Women in Open Source Presentations
by Ostatic Staff - Dec. 03 , 2008
The Southern California Linux Expo ( SCALE ) is one of the most heavily attended open source events held each year .
Slated to begin February 20 , 2009 , SCALE will once again host the annual Women in Open Source Conference ( WIOS ) , a one - day event where women in the open source industry have the chance to showcase their work , share accomplishments , and brainstorm ideas .
SCALE organizers have put out a call for papers in order to begin making decisions on presentations and are now accepting proposal ideas .
Virtually anyone is welcome to attend or suggest a presentation .
" Past attendees at this event have included women in technology , teachers , and parents of young girls .
As a woman , if you 've had experience working on a Free & Open Source project , deploying Free and Open Source software or been involved in the Free and Open Source community , please join us , " says the event 's Web page .
Last year 's talks covered a wide range of topics .
Perl Foundation President Allison Randal talked about " The Art of Conference Presentations " -- how to propose , create and give a great presentation from the ground up .
OpenLogic 's Stormy Peters discussed what it was like to be a community manager , while Intel 's Danese Cooper explored why complaining about the predominate issues surrounding women in open source wo n't get anyone anywhere .
To have a proposal considered for the next WIOS , head to the WIOS page at SCALE 's Web site for full details .
Archbishop Desmond Tutu said he was ashamed of what the UN had done Archbishop Desmond Tutu has accused South Africa of losing the moral high ground by failing to stand up to Zimbabwe 's president Robert Mugabe .
The Nobel Peace Prize winner told the BBC that using force should be an option to get rid of Mr Mugabe .
South Africa 's African National Congress ( ANC ) leader Jacob Zuma has also called for a quick end to what he describes as an " untenable ' situation .
And the UK foreign secretary described Mr Mugabe a " stain " on Zimbabwe .
' Deeply distressed ' Archbishop
Tutu also said he was saddened that his own country appeared not to be on the side of Zimbabweans .
FROM THE TODAY PROGRAMME Please turn on JavaScript .

More from Today programme
He said : " How much more suffering is going to make us say ' No we have given Mr Mugabe enough time ? ' "
South Africa had a leadership role as its president chairs the Southern African Development Community , he added .
But he told BBC Radio 4 's Today programme that South Africa had instead betrayed its legacy by blocking firmer action from the United Nations .
He added : " I want to say first of all that I have been very deeply disappointed , saddened by the position that South Africa has taken at the United Nations Security Council in being an obstacle to the Security Council dealing with that matter .
" And I have to say that I am deeply , deeply distressed that we should be found not on the side of the ones who are suffering .
I certainly am ashamed of what they 've done in the United Nations .
" For the world to say ' no , we are waiting for South Africa 's membership of the Security Council to lapse and then we can take action ' . "
Descent into chaos
The archbishop said the situation was an " awful indictment " to a country that had a " proud record of a struggle against a vicious system " .
He said : " We should have been the ones who for a very long time occupied the moral high ground .
I 'm afraid we have betrayed our legacy . "
Mr Miliband was responding to a Times leading article that said the Foreign Office believed it would be a mistake for Britain to get tough with Mr Mugabe .
In his letter to the newspaper , the foreign secretary reaffirmed the UK's view that Mr Mugabe had to go .
I have to say that I am deeply , deeply distressed that we should be found not on the side of the ones who are suffering
Archbishop Desmond Tutu
" Any sane person realises that Mugabe 's misrule is only spurring Zimbabwe 's descent into chaos , " he wrote .
" But your leading article channelled frustration at his continued abuse of power into an attack on the FCO [ Foreign and Commonwealth Office ] without logic , fact or justification . "
Mr Miliband added : " As long as Mugabe rules Zimbabwe he remains a stain on that country .
I acknowledge that he is also a stain on the international community , which has not been able to deliver the will of the Zimbabwean people .
" If attacking the FCO would help a single Zimbabwean I would understand that might be a price worth paying .
But it does not . "
In his Christmas message , ANC leader Mr Zuma said : " The new year must bring a speedy resolution to this utterly untenable situation . "
The United Nations meanwhile says it might take up to six months to control Zimbabwe 's cholera outbreak , which has now killed 1,174 people .
Unicef spokesman Roeland Monasch said the number of cholera cases had now increased to nearly 24,000 , spreading to all 10 of Zimbabwe 's provinces .
Mr Monasch said 5 % of cases were proving fatal , a very high rate compared with other cholera outbreaks .

Blood bags at a Gaza City hospital , 27 December 2008 .
( Sameh Habeeb )
What followed seems pretty much surreal at this point .
Never had we imagined anything like this .
It all happened so fast but the amount of death and destruction is inconceivable , even to me and I ’m in the middle of it and a few hours have passed already passed .
Six locations were hit during the air raid on Gaza City .
The images are probably not broadcasted on US news channels .
There were piles and piles of bodies in the locations that were hit .
As you looked at them you could see that a few of the young men were still alive , someone lifts a hand , and another raises his head .
They probably died within moments because their bodies were burned , most had lost limbs , some of their guts were hanging out and they were all lying in pools of blood .
Outside my home which is close to the two largest universities in Gaza , a missile fell on a large group of young men , university students .
They ’d been warned not to stand in groups as it makes them an easy target , but they were waiting for buses to take them home .
Seven were killed , four students and three of our neighbors ’ kids , young men who were from the Rayes family and were best friends .
As I ’m writing this I can hear a funeral procession go by outside ; I looked out the window a moment ago and it was the three Rayes boys .
They spent all their time together when they were alive , they died together and now they are sharing the same funeral together .
Nothing could stop my 14 - year - old brother from rushing out to see the bodies of his friends laying in the street after they were killed .
He has n’t spoken a word since .
What did Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert mean when he stated that we the people of Gaza were n’t the enemy , that it was Hamas and Islamic Jihad which were being targeted ?
Was that statement made to infuriate us out of out our state of shock , to pacify any feelings of rage and revenge ?
To mock us ?
Were the scores of children on their way home from school and who are now among the dead and the injured , Hamas militants ?
A little further down my street about half an hour after the first strike , three schoolgirls happened to be passing by one of the locations when a missile struck the Preventative Security Headquarters building .
The girls ’ bodies were torn into pieces and covered the street from one side to the other .
In all the locations , people are going through the dead , terrified of recognizing a family member among them .
The streets are strewn with their bodies , their arms , legs , feet , some with shoes and some without .
The city is in a state of alarm , panic and confusion , cell phones are n’t working , hospitals and morgues are backed up and some of the dead are still lying in the streets with their families gathered around them , kissing their faces , holding on to them .
Outside the destroyed buildings old men are kneeling on the ground , weeping .
Their slim hopes of finding their sons still alive vanish after taking one look at what had become of their office buildings .
And even after the dead are identified , doctors are having a hard time gathering the right body parts in order to hand them over to their families .
The hospital hallways look like a slaughterhouse .
It ’s truly worse than any horror movie you could ever imagine .
The floor is filled with blood , the injured are propped up against the walls or laid down on the floor , side by side with the dead .
Doctors are working frantically and people with injuries that are n’t life - threatening are sent home .
A relative of mine was injured by a flying piece of glass from her living room window and she had deep cut right down the middle of her face .
She was sent home ; too many others needed more urgent medical attention .
Her husband , a dentist , took her to his clinic and sewed up her face using local anesthesia .
More than 200 people dead in today ’s air raids .
That means more than 200 funeral processions , a few today , most of them tomorrow , probably .
To think that yesterday these families were worried about food and heat and electricity .
At this point I think they — actually all of us — would gladly have had Hamas forever sign off every last basic right we ’ve been calling for the last few months if it could have stopped this from ever having happened .
The bombing was very close to my home .
Most of my extended family live in the area .
My family is OK , but two of my uncles ’ homes were damaged ,
We can rest easy , Gazans can mourn tonight .
Israel is said to have promised not to wage any more air raids for now .
People suspect that the next step will be targeted killings , which will inevitably means scores more of innocent bystanders whose fates have already been sealed .

She returned to Gaza in September 2007 where she currently works as a freelance journalist .

The important thing to remember is that PlayStation Home will continue to evolve and change overtime , so be sure to get in often so you do n’t miss out …
See you in PlayStation Home .
This problem is n’t limited to New York Assembly races .
It has directly affected the presidential campaigns .
Last year , Fox News ordered John McCain to stop using a clip of himself at a Fox News - moderated debate .
Last month , Warner Music Group demanded YouTube remove an amateur video attacking Barack Obama that included its music , while NBC asked the Obama campaign to pull an ad that included some NBC News video with Tom Brokaw and Keith Olbermann .
No doubt , these corporations are simply trying to avoid controversy or embarrassment , but by claiming infringement , they are effectively censoring political speech .
Senator McCain has taken a lead in responding to this copyright extremism .
In a letter addressed to YouTube last week , the McCain campaign rightly criticized the Web site ’s decision to remove work that is “ clearly privileged under the fair use doctrine ” of copyright law and called upon YouTube to be more protective of political speech by conducting a more extensive review of material before it gets taken down .
Copyright law has become a political weapon because of a statute passed a decade ago : the Digital Millennium Copyright Act .
That law tells carriers like YouTube that unless they quickly remove material posted by users that is alleged to infringe copyright , they themselves could be liable for the infringement .
Understandably , YouTube and others have become quite vigilant in removing allegedly infringing content .
Indeed , the Web site has gone beyond the requirements of the law and has begun to shut down the accounts of people alleged to have violated copyright just three times .
The digital copyright act gives the alleged infringer an opportunity to demand that the content be restored .
But in the height of a political campaign , even a few hours of downtime can be the difference between effective and ineffective .
The law thus creates a perfect mechanism to censor political speech during the only time it could matter .
Recognizing this , campaigns and their allies are beginning to exploit this weapon .
The answer to this problem is not to abolish or ignore copyright .
Instead , the law should be revised , bringing focus to the contexts in which its important economic incentives are needed , and removing it from contexts where it is n’t .
The demise of the subprime mortgage industry has been hard on predatory brokers , too .
They feasted for years on bad loans until reality crashed down and the money ran out , and there they were : sharks without a frenzy .
Now they are circling again .
Predators of every sort have regrouped and returned to their old ways , this time as loan - modification companies , inserting themselves between hard - strapped homeowners and banks , offering to work deals  for cash up front .
It ’s a high - pressure , high - volume business , advertising in the usual low - rent ways : talk - radio ads , Web come-ons , fliers on car windshields .
The ads are full of glossy promises , like this one for a Long Island outfit : “ Reduce your mortgage rate to as low as 4 % .
No refinancing  no closing costs .
Reduce your monthly payment .
Foreclosures , late pays / bad credit okay . ”
It ’ll cost you  in this case , 1 percent of your outstanding loan , half of it in advance .
There ’s often nothing illegal about this booming and largely unregulated business .
Some shops are true scams , taking the money and running .
But others are just immoral , profiting on fear and false hopes with expensive services that nonprofit organizations and government agencies offer for nothing .
The more I thought about it , the more I wanted to learn how to make a pizza – and that 's why I came here .
But as often happens when travelling , the world was taking me over .
It was increasingly hard to stay focused on my task .
It 's quite good to go on holiday with some kind of deeply personal mission in mind ; it does n't matter how whimsical it is .
A mild sense of purpose , something to do , makes luxury so much more appealing and roughing it so much more meaningful .
I was staying at the Torre Maizza , a five - star converted farmhouse in Puglia , near the sea .
By the time I 'd been there for 24 hours , I 'd realised that it is a strong candidate for best hotel in the world and – AND !
– they have a cookery school .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Torre Maizza is a fairly rustic but historic and beautiful building that has been given a high - spec 21st - century makeover .
It has all the usual five - star gubbins ; it 's lavishly but discreetly appointed with all conceivable whistles and bells ; there 's a golf course and spa .
More importantly , the restaurant and the bar serve unparalleled delectable local organic wonders .
In fact , the Torre Maizza grows its own vegetables , prepares its own herbal teas , cures its own meat from its own animals .
Hell , they even make their own wine .
As soon as the staff got a sniff that I was vaguely interested in food it was all over .
" I would like to find out how to make mozzarella , " I said to the concierge and from that moment , my life was no longer my own .
It 's one of those hotels where everything you would like to happen happens with zero fuss in an abracadabra style .
When he found out I was a cheese - head , Vittorio , the hotel 's owner , took me under his wing .
And so it was that the evening after I arrived we were sitting under the stars in Taverna della Gelosia , one of dozens of restaurants in Ostuni , a walled city apparently made from lace and icing sugar .
It was about a 40 - minute drive from the hotel and Vittorio drove with less verve than most Italians , so we could talk .
About food .
We 'd dropped in on a couple of his buddies en route to dinner , most memorably Riccardo , the proprietor of a kind of space cave in the hillside within the citadel : all neon and nibbles and big bass drum .
Dozens of exquisite knick - knacks flowed towards us during the course of our aperitifs : tiny little sausages and betwiddled artichokes ; weird mushrooms , cured pork with rare cream cheese stuffing , a gargantuan extravaganza .
( Lunch had already been spectacular .
The hotel had sent a car to pick me up and take me to its beach restaurant Torre Coccaro when the guys on the boat landed a particularly fine tuna .
I was still reeling from that . )
So , I 'd come to make pizza but now I was sitting in one of the most charming creeper - clad courtyards I 'd ever seen , rolling my eyes at the food on offer .
It was exactly the place I 'm always looking for on holiday but can never find .
Vittorio contemplated the menu with compelling hauteur as I garbled on about how fantastic everything was .
" Well , she likes to make a lot of this middle - aged stuff , this lady .
It 's nice , but mainly stews , " he explained , evidently slightly disappointed .
Frizzante arrived with tiny red berries moving in Brownian motion in the effervescence .
We talked about food again : the 10 kinds of figs , the seven or eight kinds of tisane ( herb tea ) that they grow at Torre Maizza .
The luxuries flowed through us like a cleansing river .
My gorgonzola porcini was sumptuous .
" What are you eating , Vittorio ? "
" Oh , I do n't know : wild boar or something . "
I think I 'll spare you the masses of exquisite effortless endless detail of that spectacular feast and skip straight to the pomegranate liqueur .
As that arrived , I fell once more into gushing eulogies .
" Is nothing .
My granny make this stuff , " said Vittorio , smiling .
He would n't let me have a dessert and took me instead for ice cream and espresso in a cobbled square on the way home .
Italians always know exactly which place in town serves the best ice cream and they seem to have a new word for a new kind coffee every time I go back .
Now they are drinking " espressino " , which seems to be an espresso with about a teaspoon of hot milk and no foam .
We still think lattes are glamorous but things have moved on here .
In Italy , the culinary bar is always moving upwards – and it started really quite high .
British food has been getting better and better – and the best food in Britain is as good as anywhere – but in Italy the difference is that it is almost impossible to eat badly .
Little boys are taught how to make pasta by their grannies .
Puglia is quite far to the South of Italy and there are influences from Greece and Turkey , and even Arabic and Moorish touches to the architecture and cookery ; all those ancient cultures rubbing along side by side for centuries .
It 's a bounteous place and Vittorio gave the impression of a child living in a vast and wonderful sweet shop .
In the morning , the chef from the hotel , who was called Giuseppe and looked like Morrissey , took me to meet the mozzarella man , who worked in a nearby market town called Monopoli and looked like Ed Norton .
Ed was playing with what appeared to be a giant cappuccino machine , heating a vat of milk with a huge hose that blew mad professor amounts of steam from an intriguing plumbing manifold .
In Cheddar , making cheese takes about a year and a half , but in Puglia they 've got the whole process down to an hour .
It 's so simple .
The cheesemaker heated the milk to bath temperature , threw in some rennet and stood around looking cool while his huge blancmange set .
The cows were outside so I went to say hello .
When I came back in he was draining off the liquid , the whey , which would be fed to the pigs .
He showed some decent knife skills as he chopped the curd , but once he'd cut it into pieces all he had to do was add boiling water and lots of salt .
He worked the curds in the hot water like pizza dough and it gradually got stretchier and stretchier .
The heat polymerises the cheese molecules .
He kept on adding more hot water and stretching as a queue of exacting cheese freaks formed in front of the dazzling cheese counter .
I bought everything .
As we were leaving , the vegetable man arrived : fat grapes , cherry tomatoes , plum tomatoes , peaches , peppers , pears and mad melons .
We were waylaid as Giuseppe and the vegetable man became embroiled in animated discussions on tomatoes , while a doubled - up granny crept out from somewhere and started sniffing the grapes carefully .
Eventually , Giuseppe elected to take some tomatoes .
They were the plumpest , reddest - looking tomatoes I 've ever seen .
We scooted by the market on the way back .
A million kinds of olive , mussels like big bunches of bananas , fish men , fruit men , men selling weird stuff that defied categorisation but looked like it probably lived in the sea .
I was looking forward to my pizza by now and was wondering if we were going to pick some wheat next , but Giuseppe said that would n't be necessary , so after a snoot of espressino with the geezers in the square he insisted I see the church .
It looked like it had been done by Versace , a swirling marble trifle , all domes and complex curves with cherubs , angels in niches and saints ' skulls in the walls .
Creepy .
I really wanted to learn how to cook a pizza , but I suppose I 'd already learnt that the trickiest thing about cooking is assembling the right ingredients , which is probably why no one ever cooks anything they see being prepared on television .
You need the right gear , too , and that means a pizza oven .
Ever since I got home , I 've been dreaming of building one .
Giuseppe took me back to the hotel 's cookery school .
There was a fire roaring and the executive chef let the pizza expert take over at this point .
In no time he was twirling dough around .
I may need to be shown how to do that one more time ; making dough looked slightly more complicated than making mozzarella .
But it was a long way short of bewildering , nonetheless .
I managed something resembling dough and pretty soon we were oven ready .
Pizza oven ready .
Conventional ovens do n't get hot enough to cook a pizza properly .
The dough needs to explode .
But once you 've got the ingredients and the oven , well it 's a pizza cake .
It 's really just a cooked open cheese and tomato sandwich .
And what could be finer than that ?

Meditation 'as effective as medication ' in treating depression
Buddhist meditation techniques can be just as effective at combating depression as medication , a study has found .
The treatment , known as mindfulness - based cognitive therapy ( MBCT ) , helps people focus on the present instead of dwelling on the past or planning the future .
Fifteen months after an eight - week trial , 47 per cent of people with long - term depression who underwent the therapy suffered a relapse , compared to 60 per cent of those taking anti-depressant drugs .
Relaxation : Meditation as effective as medication
Professor Willem Kuyken , from the Mood Disorders Centre at the University of Exeter , said MBCT could shorten NHS waiting lists for psychological therapies .
He said : ' Anti - depressants are widely used by people who suffer from depression and that 's because they tend to work .
' But , while they 're very effective in helping reduce the symptoms of depression , when people come off them they are particularly vulnerable to relapse .
' MBCT takes a different approach - it teaches people skills for life .
What we have shown is that when people work at it , these skills for life help keep people well .
' Our results suggest MBCT may be a viable alternative for some of the 3.5 million people in the UK known to be suffering from this debilitating condition . '
He said the therapy is less costly than other treatments because one psychologist could treat many people .
Di Cowan , 53 , of Sampford Peverell , East Devon , took anti-depressants for more than 15 years before undergoing the group psychology .
The retired maths teacher now practises meditation techniques four of five times a week .
He said : ' It 's helped me immensely .
It 's given me the ability to come up against something that would have previously thrown me , think it through , come up with a solution and then move on .
' It 's helped me deal with recurrent thoughts .
My view of the world has changed and I look at life in a new light .
I 'm much more cheerful and positive .
Other people noticed a change .
' My friends and family were very quick to comment that I was showing an improvement . '
The trial saw 123 people with long - term depression split into two groups .
Half underwent MBCT in groups of between eight and 15 people , while the other half continued with their medication .
The study , funded by the Medical Research Council ( MRC ) , was published today in the Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology .
Way back in May of 2003 , when the internet was ugly and Web 2.0 did n’t exist yet , CompUSA had an online deal that caught my eye - a WinTV PVR - 250 Hardware MPEG Encoder card for $ 99 after rebate .
I had been debating the whole media center setup for a while and decided this was good time to make the leap .
The state of media center software at the time was pretty shoddy – convergence was talked about , but rarely happened .
Windows Media Center was n’t generally available and XBox Media Center was still in its infancy .
In either case , recording and playback of liveTV was n’t possible .
On the Linux front a war was being waged between MythTV and Freevo .
Freevo had a slick interface and supported almost any capture card , but because it shelled out to other programs for recording and viewing content , it just felt weird .
Furthermore , this lack of integration meant you could n’t use it like a TiVo to watch and record live TV because one program recorded TV while another played it back , and a notification was made only after it was done recording .
MythTV was still fairly new at the time , and sure enough , just before I got the card , support was added for hardware MPEG encoders that used the IVTV driver – such as the WinTV PVR 250 .
I ’ve been a reliable MythTV user and occasional hacker since then .
MythTV has developed very slowly since then .
Each new release brings support for a few more capture cards , and maybe some small new features , but it ’s slow development , especially in the user interface category leaves me feeling like I ’m stuck in 2003 still .
With some luck , the upcoming release of MythTV 0.22 will change that .
In fact , MythTV 0.22 could really rock your world , and here is why :
Hauppauge HD - PVR Support
MythTV remains one of the best choices if you want to capture high definition video .
The excellent support for pcHDTV cards , and the even better support for the incredible HD HomeRun , make it trivial to capture over the air or unencrypted cable high definition signals .
However , once spot where MythTV cannot compete with Windows Media center is for premium cable channels .
MythTV will never be able to support cable card tuners because of the closed environment that these external tuners live in and the current requirement that the tuners be locked to the PC they ’re purchased with .
So while it ’s perfectly easy to watch NBC and CBS in high definition , your hopes of being able to watch HBO or ESPN in high definition are slim at best .
Luckily , Hauppauge has developed an excellent solution that fits the needs of the MythTV user perfectly .
The Hauppauge HD - PVR model 1212
The Hauppauge HD - PVR is a USB component video capture box that transcodes signals up to 1080 i to H.264 video in real time .
On a technical level this means that you take the analog component ( YPbPr ) output of your cable TV box and it feed to the HD - PVR which will then re-digitize the video .
Quality snobs will note that this results in an extra stage of decompression and recompression which leads to artifacts , and they ’d be right , but luckily the quality of the box is pretty good , so only the most discerning eye will notice a different in video quality .
HD - PVR support will be included in the next release of MythTV .
QT4 and New Theming
MythTV is probably one of the last programs on the planet that still uses QT3 as it ’s widget set .
It ’s a reliable widget set , with moderate theme capabilities , but it was clearly designed for desktop applications .
You can change the color and appearance of widgets , like scroll bars , buttons , and drop down menus , but it does n’t have the ability to provide nice transitions between screens or widgets .
Basically , you ’re working with a static widget set .
Sometime , probably a couple of years ago , MythTV introduced support for OpenGL screen transitions .
Now when I go from the main menu to my recordings screen , a nice transition happens , but on the screen I ’m still using the same static screen with no transitions or interactivity .
Several times on the mailing list people have brought up how subtle transitions and audible feedback would really add to the experience – after all , TiVo did n’t succeed because it was the most feature filled , it succeeded because it had the best user interface .
Currently the closest thing that MythTV can do is run an external program that plays a sound when a key is received by the application .
I ’ve tried it , and it ’s just not quite right .
QT4 should fix many of these issues .
Nokia did n’t purchase QT to sell the widget toolkit as another system for creating desktop applications , they intended to use it in embedded applications where things do n’t always look the same .
The new features of QT4 , which was released way back in 2005 , really make it a top notch widget set .
In particular , the entire toolkit has been abstracted to work nicely with OpenGL , allowing for better transition effects , theming and mapping of graphics .
Watch out for the Trippy Pink Floyd Shit around 1:40
When combined with the longstanding ticket to create and have all widgets use libmythui , this means that effects will be getting a much needed overhaul .
Including smooth transitions on sliders and small amounts of sound effects .
VDPAU Support
Although PCs have gotten much faster since MythTV first arrived on the scene , MythTV can still tax your computer , especially when watching HD content and doing other things in the background .
It ’s fairly normal for me to watch an HD program as it is recording , record another HD program , flag previous recordings for commercials , and transcode content all at the same time .
You can play with nice settings and realtime threads to ensure the playback never skips a beat , but that ’s difficult , also you ’re ignoring the fact that most modern video cards have video decoding acceleration built in – effectively allowing you use your CPU only to push data across the bus , while the video card decodes and displays the video .
This support is nothing new , it ’s been around for a while in the form of XvMC .
Unfortunately , unless you ’re using a Via or Intel chipset , which are not common in standalone MythTV boxes , you ’re probably going to be out of luck here .
n Vidia cards do have some support for XvMC , but you sacrifice color in your on screen display and it rarely works properly .
Furthermore , XvMC has some architectural issues that cause problems when decoding HD size content frames .
In November , however , nVidia announced the creation of VDPAU - the Video Decoding and Presentation API for Unix .
In a nutshell , VDPAU is a moderately generic API , like Microsoft ’s DxVA , that utilizes nVidia ’s PureVideo technology to display video with less CPU .
Taking less CPU means that you can do more in the background and not worry about stuttering – or , if you ’re concerned about power , heat , and noise , like most MythTV users , you can use a more efficient less power hungry processor .
Just how much better is it ?
The guys at Phoronix did a series of VDPAU benchmarks that showed CPU usage with VDPAU go from around 40 % with X - Video to less than 5 % with VDPAU .
More savings for you .
Even though VDPAU has been released for only a month , the MythTV guys are hard at work supporting it .
The first patches for VDPAU support were committed in late November and there has been heavy development ever since .
If you ’re thinking about getting a new video card an nVidia 9000 series looks like it would be a great choice .
The Future
I ’ll be honest , there are times that I get really frustrated with the slow progress of MythTV and how the development seems to stall out frequently , despite its fairly large user base .
I do n’t consider myself a developer of MythTV , but I have contributed patches to the project , such as allowing the transcoder to crop letterboxes and pillarboxes from videos , and have worked as an advocate of MythTV locally .
Despite this , the poor usuability of the project continually has me evaluating other options , such as Boxee , which provides integration with Hulu and soon Netflix , but sadly lacks the ability to record and play back television .
I was really excited when Nero announced LiquidTV , but the poor review and complete inability to record QAM make it useless in hilly Pittsburgh where cable is required if you want to receive more than one or two stations .
So , for the time being , I ’m on MythTV – it has a suitable wife acceptance factor and allows me to record most everything I want .
The changes coming down the pipe for 0.22 will only make that better .
The beach can be undeniably a stress absorber and can be a natural stress reliever .
The nature itself is a good variable in keeping the body well - rounded and in a good state of mind also .
It is an inevitable fact that we cannot avoid facing some problems and challenges as we go through life .
Some of the stressful things that can accumulate in our mind and body are the stressors from work , from school , from family problems , and from personal , and or relationship matters .
However , these problems can be easily gotten over with the help of a natural venue for venting out and for releasing negative energies .
One of the most famous option for you to do in order to get over stress and other hardships in life is by going to the beach .
Here are some of the examples of the things that you can possibly do in order to achieve a stress - free life :
1. ENJOY STAR GAZING WITH SOME FRIENDS
The night sky at the beach is kind of a moment for serenity and isolation .
During this time of the day , the night sky can surely give you the chance to contemplate well about your life and the life struggles that you might be going through right now .
However , with the help of the nature , as the waves splash the waters towards the shore , and as the cold wind blows , you can look up at the sky and realize that not everything seems to be broken or empty .
On the other hand , breathing some fresh and relaxing air can give your mind a peaceful and wonderful time as you contemplate and as you think about things over .
2. HAVE A ROUGH CAMP
Having a rough camp can never be more enjoyable than spending it with your friends .
Being with your friends can surely help you release and vent out by having long and deep conversations with them .
It would also be a good time for you to catch up with some of your old friends .
On the other hand it is also of great importance to feel a new environment aside from the comfort that you can get at home .
It might sound a little bit more adventurous and hassle , but once you have tried this , it would be one of the most special things that you would be willing to do over and over again .
3. BARBECUE PARTY
During your stay by the sea side , it would be a good time to cook some good food as you spend a rough camp .
You can also start a bon fire which can give heat and comfort for everyone .
A perfect barbecue specialty would be hotdogs and marshmallows , some pork or beef meat , and some juicy sauce for the barbecue .
You might as well grill some good burger patty and enjoy the taste of a burger with some spicy taste and some cheeze melting in the mouth .
How cool would that sound , right ?
4. PLAY SOME MUSIC WITH FRIENDS
Another good thing that you can do as you have a cool and nice rough camping by the beach would be playing some good music .
All you have to do is play a guitar and let everyone in the squad sing along .
As you grab a can of beer or soda , it would be nice to sing to release all the anger , frustration , sadness , depression , and other negative energies that consume your mind , body , and soul .
It is of great importance to express your feelings whether it is good or bad , through the means of singing and or playing some nice music .
5. ENJOY THE ACCOMMODATING LODGE AND SERVICES OF THE RESORT
If ever that you are not comfortable with a rough camping , do not worry because some resorts do offer some cottages or accommodating lodge that has a quality as if it is a project done by orlando handyman .
This way , you do not have to worry about having a peace of mind and having some good and comfortable sleep as you spend the night at the resort .
It would also be a good time for you to have a comfortable time as you enjoy the beach .
This is specialized for people who cannot take the too cold blow of the wind by the beach .
We probably all know how cold is it to spend the night in a rough camp beside the beach , right ?
It can not be tolerated sometimes .
So no matter how much we want to have a rough camping to save money , there is still an option that tempts us to just get a cottage or room instead .
There are plenty of ways for you to enjoy the beach .
Do not just limit yourself by staying at your comfort zone .
As people say , you can never explore the wonders of the sea just by staying at the sea shore .
You need to go out and explore the wonders of the sea by going through the adventures that the ocean can offer .
Explore the sea and hone your skills and talent .
Do not be deceived by the temptation of your comfort zone .
Enjoy the world today because you might just regret that you have spent your entire life waiting for the right time and right moment to explore something new and something brave .

AUSTIN , Texas , Nov. 18 ( UPI ) --
Ninety - eight percent of 450 Texas biologists and biological anthropologists reject the theories of the intelligent design movement , a survey indicates .
The scientists responded to survey conducted by the Texas Freedom Network , an advocacy organization based in Austin that describes itself as " a mainstream voice to counter the religious right , " the Fort Worth Star - Telegram reported .
The survey results were released this week as the Texas State Board of Education prepared to discuss public school science curriculum .

The group 's survey of biologists at 49 public and private Texas universities also found that about 95 percent of the respondents want evolution to be the only theory of the origin of life taught in public schools .
" Opponents of evolution often say that we should ' teach the controversy , ' " Raymond Eve , a sociologist at the University of Texas at Arlington who conducted the survey , told the Star - Telegram .
" The response of scientists is : What controversy ? "
Backers of intelligent design theories said the survey was flawed because less than half of the 1,019 faculty members contacted for it responded .
" The only indication of that case which has been given to the appellant is the first sentence in paragraph 13 of the amended open statement , ' the Security Service therefore assesses that the risk of Abu Qatada absconding has increased since his release in June 2008 ' . "
A 33 - year - old man who was shot last week by Lakewood police was released today from the hospital and taken to Jefferson County Jail .
Shawn Patrick Brndiar was booked on charges of second - degree assault on a peace officer and resisting arrest .
There also are several outstanding warrants for his arrest , police said .
Brndiar was shot Nov. 19 in the parking lot of the Wal - Mart at 440 Wadsworth Blvd .
after officers contacted him because he had been acting suspiciously .
During a struggle with two officers , Brndiar was shot in the torso after police say he used a Taser on an officer he grabbed the device from and attempted to Taser a second officer .

THERE are no tanks in the streets or protesters occupying the airport , but Canada is in the midst of political turmoil the like of which this normally placid country has rarely seen .
Only seven weeks ago Stephen Harper , the prime minister , won a second term for his Conservative government , but once again without winning a parliamentary majority .
Now the three disparate opposition parties — the centrist Liberals , the socialist New Democrats ( NDP ) and the separatist Bloc Québécois — have ganged up in order to oust the Conservatives and replace them with a centre - left coalition .
That left Mr Harper scrabbling for survival .
On Thursday December 4th he asked Michaëlle Jean , who as governor - general acts as Canada 's head of state , to suspend Parliament until January .
After a two - hour meeting , she agreed to do so .
That means that for now Mr Harper has dodged a confidence vote scheduled for December 8th that the opposition parties , provided they stick together , were bound to win .
The opposition holds 163 of the 308 seats in the House of Commons .
Their alliance is an unlikely one .
Stéphane Dion , the Liberal leader , is an academic from Quebec who came into politics a decade ago expressly to oppose the French - speaking province 's separatists , represented by Gilles Duceppe and his Bloc Québécois .
Jack Layton , the NDP leader , has spent his career savaging previous Liberal governments .
Yet on Monday the three leaders wrote to the governor - general offering to form a Liberal - NDP coalition government .
The Bloc will not join in but its 49 MPs will back it for the next 18 months .
The letter prompted Ms Jean , a former refugee from Haiti , to cut short a trip to Europe to rush back to Ottawa .
Under the constitution , it is the governor - general 's prerogative to invite a party leader to form a government , with or without an election .
This sudden decision to stage a political coup was prompted by a government economic statement on November 27th .
The ostensible reason for opposition outrage was that Jim Flaherty , the finance minister , offered no new measures to stimulate the economy .
But that smacks of a pretext : despite alarmist headlines , for now the economy remains in relatively good shape .
What really provoked the opposition parties was that , having said there was no need for extraordinary measures , Mr Flaherty threw in some highly partisan ones : a big cut in public funding for political parties ; a ban on strikes by public - service unions ; and measures making it harder for women civil servants to complain if they are not paid the same as men .
A joke doing the rounds in Ottawa holds that Mr Harper , credited with having united two feuding right - of - centre parties to form the Conservatives in 2003 , has now done what was thought impossible and united the left too .
The government quickly dropped the measures on political funding and the right to strike .
But it was too late to stop the opposition 's plans to seize power .
The opposition 's putative coalition is beset with flaws .
Its problems start with its leader .
Mr Dion piloted the Liberals to their worst - ever showing in the election .
He is due to be replaced as Liberal leader at a party convention in May .
Then there is policy , which has required some difficult compromises .
Mr Dion has agreed to drop his unpopular carbon tax ( he now backs a cap - and - trade system for carbon emissions ) .
Mr Layton has dropped his previous opposition to cuts in corporate taxes .
A further awkwardness concerns reliance on the votes of the Bloc , whose raison d'être is the break - up of Canada .
All this means that Mr Harper may yet manage to cling to power .
He has defiantly raised the political temperature .
He has accused the Liberals of selling out the country to separatists ( in fact , in his first term he sometimes relied on separatist votes and when in opposition the Conservatives similarly offered to replace a Liberal minority government with help from the Bloc and the NDP ) .
The Conservatives are repeating that message in a blitz of radio and television advertising , as well as planning rallies across the country .
He has vowed to “ use all legal means to resist this undemocratic seizure of power ” .
Nevertheless , the prime minister is damaged .
Although there is no open revolt in Conservative ranks , several ministers pointedly failed to applaud the prime minister in the House of Commons this week .
But Mr Harper shows no sign of contrition .
Now he has bought himself time .
He will use it to prepare a budget for January 27th , the day after Parliament will resume , that will doubtless include some measures to stimulate the economy .
He will also hope that the opposition 's ardour for unity may cool .
But the parliamentary hiatus might allow the Liberals to bring forward their leadership vote and replace the lacklustre Mr Dion .
Mr Harper may have merely won a stay of execution .
Whatever happens , this week 's events may change Canadian politics for ever .
Only the Liberals or Conservatives have governed in Ottawa since 1926 , but Canada now has four significant parties ( a fifth , the Greens , won nearly 7 % of the vote but no seats ) .
Coalition politics may be inevitable .
Even so , Canadians have little idea who might be governing them after Christmas .
There ’s upside in a down economy — if you ’re in the condom business .
According to an interview with the condom manufacturer Trojan , their sales peak is the week between Christmas and New Years .
Come Santa season , everyone seems to jump in the sack .
( Here ’s further proof of the “ Santa effect . ” )
What is it about Christmas that revs up the sex drive ?
The increase in sexual activity at at the end of December harks back to Saturnalia , a pagan holiday when people feasted on boar flesh and indulged in a lot of prehibernatory sex .
Disapproving early Christians coopted the sexfest and turned it into the celebration of Jesus ’s birth .
“ Why either / or ? ” ask modern day revelers , and now many both celebrate the baby Jesus and also enjoy conceiving ( or preventing the conception of ) their own babies .
It ’s unsurprising that people have more sex during the weeklong holiday : we have time to relax , drink , and socialize more .
And not everyone wears Trojans — the birthrate in the United States peaks in the summer and in September , nine months after the winter bacchanalia .
Even more interesting , there may be a biological reason why people ’s sex lives heat up as the seasons cool down .
In BLONDES I describe the connection between hormone levels and waning daylight hours in autumn .
And we ’re not alone : other animals in the northern hemisphere also have their rutting season in the late fall — including reindeer .

Although Gregor.us is ostensibly an energy blog I sometimes feel the need to tackle macro issues .
Over the past few weeks I ’ve been trying to focus my thoughts on our current moment , where we find that deflationary pressures are rampant but reflationary policies globally are of a historic magnitude .
What follows is my attempt to take the two outcomes through , to their most obvious conclusions .
Deflationists
If you believe deflation will take hold , and no amount of monetary policy or fiscal policy globally can prevent it , then prepare for the collapse of the US financial system for the following reason : there will not be enough economic activity to support the asset base of the key banks and financial institutions .
Operations of the kind that took place last week with Citigroup would occur on a weekly basis .
In such an environment , even the good debtors will lose their jobs , run down savings , or walk away from their homes .
The FED will respond with more printing of money to give to the banks , but this frankly becomes nationalisation and then the government will mediate the aggregate private debt by forgiving most of it : all the mortgages , credit cards and commercial loans .
It will become painfully clear that no future economic activity will take place unless 90 % of the previous debt is forgiven .
Bottom line : in deflation there will be no condition present that will allow Americans to increase their savings , pay down debts , and repair balance sheets .
In deflation , the repair model simply will not happen .
It will be a collapse .
And the government will also default on its debt .
Infllationists
If you believe inflation takes hold and / or deflation never takes hold , then there is a chance that enough growth can take place while the debt is reduced by inflation that would allow Americans to keep working and devote capital to pay down debts with weaker dollars .
But , even with inflation , there is only a chance that this happens .
But , it ’s a decent chance .
Bottom line : it ’s crucial that the USD weaken substantially so that purchasing power is reduced to inhibit consumption of foreign goods , while at the same time earnings inflate via wage growth and proceeds are used to reduce debt .
The sign that reflation is taking hold would be a weakening of the USD , a rise in the stock market , and a good uptick in demand for money which would initially take place on a landscape of very low interest rates .
The Surprise
Thus , we arrive at the conundrum that I do n’t think the deflationists have figured out yet .
They are at present busily cheering on the rally in Treasuries , as yields plummet , only happy to have their thesis ( apparently ) confirmed .
What they have not figured out yet , and I am unclear why , is that deflation will detonate the private banking system , which will in turn detonate the US ability to rollover its own debt .
The government will own the banks , but , will not have enough tax revenues to service its debt .
Treasury auctions will fail , because supply will either be too large , or , the FED will be monetizing the auctions .
There will simply not be enough buyers of US debt under those conditions .
The surprise is therefore counter - intuitive : US Treasury bonds will default eventually if deflation takes hold , but , if inflation takes hold US Treasury bonds will simply go into a bad bear market –they ’ll be paid off but with cheaper dollars .
For the United States , a nation of debtors not savers , no truer words were ever spoken : inflate or die .

Changes done in each Linux kernel release .
Other places to get news about the Linux kernel are LWN kernel status , H - Online , or the Linux Kernel mailing list ( there is a web interface in www.lkml.org).
List of changes of older releases can be found at LinuxVersions .
If you 're going to add something here look first at LinuxChangesRules !
You can discuss the latest Linux kernel changes on the New Linux Kernel Features Forum .
Linux 5.8 has been released on Sun , 2 Aug 2020 .
Summary :
This release adds : memory management changes to improve the behaviour of systems under thrashing situations ; a event notification mechanism built on top of standard pipes that splices messages from the kernel into pipes opened by userspace ; support for having different procfs mounts with different mount options each one ; a Kernel Concurrency Sanitizer that helps to find data race bugs ; make it possible to use pidfds with setns ( 2 ) for easier attachment to the namespaces of a process ; support for Shadow Call Stack and Branch Target Identification in ARM64 to prevent security exploits ; support for Inline Encryption hardware ; new CAP_BPF and CAP_PERFMON capabilities for BPF and performance monitoring programs ; and IPv6 MPLS support .
As always , there are many other new drivers and improvements .
1. Prominent features
1.1 . Better behavior in memory thrashing situations
The reclaim code that balances between swapping and cache memory reclaim tries to predict likely reuse of a memory page .
When it fails it cannot detect when the cache is thrashing pathologically , or when the system is in the middle of a swap storm .
This code has been tuned over time to a point where even in the presence of large amounts of cold anonymous memory and a capable swap device , the VM refuses to even seriously scan these pages , and can leave the page cache thrashing needlessly .
The proliferation of fast random IO devices such as SSDs has made this undesirable behavior more noticeable .
This release sets out to address this .
Since Linux 3.15 , the kernel has exact tracking of refault IO - the ultimate cost of reclaiming the wrong pages .
This allows to use an IO cost based balancing model that is more aggressive about scanning anonymous memory when the cache is thrashing , while being able to avoid unnecessary swap storms .
This release base the LRU balance on the rate of refaults on each list , times the relative IO cost between swap device and filesystem ( swappiness ) , in order to optimize reclaim for least IO cost incurred .
The swapiness sysctl can also now be raised up to 200 to force the kernel to use swapping , which can be useful with in - memory swap , like zram or zswap .
1.2. Kernel Concurrency Sanitizer
The Kernel Concurrency Sanitizer ( KCSAN ) is a data race detector for the kernel .
Key priorities in KCSAN 's design are lack of false positives , scalability , and simplicity .
KCSAN uses compile - time instrumentation to instrument memory accesses and it is supported in both GCC and Clang .
Documentation : The Kernel Concurrency Sanitizer ( KCSAN )

1.3 . Kernel event notification mechanism
This release adds an event notification mechanism built on top of standard pipes , it splices notification messages from the kernel into pipes opened by userspace .
The pipe is opened in a special mode , and its internal buffer is used to hold messages generated by the kernel , which are then read out by read ( 2 ) .
The owner of the pipe tells the kernel which sources it would like to watch through that pipe , and filters may also be emplaced on a pipe so that certain source types and subevents can be ignored if they ’re not of interest .
In this release , the only event source is for keys / keyrings , such as linking and unlinking keys and changing their attributes , which will be used by Gnome .

1.4 . Private procfs instances
Procfs was historically tied to PID namespaces , this has the effect that all new procfs mounts are just a mirror of the internal one ; any change , any mount option update , any new future introduction will propagate to all other procfs mounts in the same PID namespace .
This release allows to have several procfs mounts with different mounts options within the same PID namespace .
The main aim of this work is to have on embedded systems one supervisor for apps .
It also adds some convenient mount options that let a private procfs mount to show only ptraceable processes in the procfs , which allows to support lightweight sandboxes in Embedded Linux .
Or a mount option that allows to hide non-pid inodes .
1.5 . Using pidfds to attach to namespaces
This release makes it possible to use pidfds to attach to the namespaces of a process , i.e. they can be passed as the first argument to the setns ( 2 ) syscall .
When a pidfd is passed , multiple namespace flags can be specified in the second argument and setns ( 2 ) will then attach the caller to all the specified namespaces all at once or to none of them .
Eg : setns ( pidfd , CLONE_NEWPID | CLONE_NEWNS | CLONE_NEWNET ) ;
These features support various use - cases where callers setns to a subset of namespaces to retain privilege , perform an action and then re-attach another subset of namespaces .
Apart from reducing the number of syscalls needed to attach to all currently supported namespaces , this also allows to setns to a set of namespaces atomically , this is useful for a standard container manager interacting with a running container .
1.6 . Shadow Call Stack and Branch Target Identification for improved security on ARM64
This release adds generic support for Clang 's Shadow Call Stack on ARM64 , which uses a shadow stack to protect function return control flow from buffer overruns on the main stack .
There is also support for ARMv8.5 - BTI in both user - and kernel - space .
This allows branch targets to limit the types of branch from which they can be called and additionally prevents branching to arbitrary code .

1.7 . Support for Inline Encryption hardware
This release supports Inline Encryption in the block layer .
Inline Encryption hardware allows software to specify an encryption context ( an encryption key , crypto algorithm , data unit num , data unit size , etc. ) along with a data transfer request to a storage device , and the inline encryption hardware will use that context to en / decrypt the data .
The inline encryption hardware is part of the storage device , and it conceptually sits on the data path between system memory and the storage device .

1.8 . Introduce CAP_BPF and CAP_PERFMON security capabilities
Using BPF has required the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability to run .
This means that software that needs to use BPF needs that capability , which grants way too many privileges .
This releases grants access to BPF functionality with a new CAP_BPF capability combined with CAP_PERFMON , CAP_NET_ADMIN and some of them kept under CAP_SYS_ADMIN .
The user process has to have : CAP_BPF to create maps and do other sys_bpf ( ) commands , CAP_BPF and CAP_PERFMON to load tracing programs , and CAP_BPF plus CAP_NET_ADMIN to load networking programs .
This release also adds the CAP_PERFMON capability for performance monitoring and observability .

1.9 . IPv6 MPLS support
This release extends the Multi-Protocol Label Switching support to IPv6 .
1.10 . bridge : Add support for Media Redundancy Protocol ( MRP )
This release adds support for the Media Redundancy Protocol is a data network protocol standardized by International Electrotechnical Commission as IEC 62439 - 2 .
It allows rings of Ethernet switches to overcome any single failure with recovery time faster than STP .
It is primarily used in Industrial Ethernet applications .
2. Core ( various )
( FEATURED ) Add Kernel Concurrency Sanitizer ( KCSAN ) commit , commit , commit , commit , commit , commit , commit , commit , commit , commit , commit , commit , commit , commit , commit
( FEATURED )
Add a general notification queue concept and add an event source for keys / keyrings , such as linking and unlinking keys and changing their attributes .
Key / keyring notifications are desirable because if you have your kerberos tickets in a file / directory , your Gnome desktop will monitor that and tell you if your credentials cache changes .
The notification queue is built on top of a standard pipe .
Messages are effectively spliced in .
The pipe is opened with a special flag : pipe2 ( fds , O_NOTIFICATION_PIPE ) .
The pipe is then configured and messages are read out of the pipe .
LSM hooks are included : A set of hooks are provided that allow an LSM to rule on whether or not a watch may be set , and a hook to allow an LSM to rule on whether or not a particular message may be posted to a particular queue commit , commit , commit , commit , commit , commit , commit , commit , commit , commit , commit , commit
( FEATURED )
Add support for Clang 's Shadow Call Stack mitigation , which uses a separately allocated shadow stack to protect against return address overwrites commit , commit , commit , commit , commit , commit , commit , commit , commit , commit , commit
( FEATURED ) namespaces : make it possible to use pidfds to attach to the namespaces of another process , i.e. they can be passed as the first argument to the setns ( 2 ) syscall .
Multiple namespace flags can be specified in the second setns ( ) argument and setns ( ) will attach the caller to all the specified namespaces all at once or to none of them .
The obvious example where this is useful is a standard container manager interacting with a running container : pushing and pulling files or directories , injecting mounts , attaching / execing any kind of process , etc .
It also allows to switch to a set of namespaces atomically commit , commit , commit
VFS ( FEATURED ) procfs : support multiple private instances commit , commit , commit , commit , commit , commit , commit , commit Add faccessat2 ( 2 ) syscall .
POSIX defines faccessat( ) as having a fourth " flags " argument , while the linux syscall does n't have it .
Glibc tries to emulate AT_EACCESS and AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW , but AT_EACCESS emulation is broken .
This release adds a new faccessat ( 2 ) syscall with the added flags argument and implement both flags commit utimensat ( 2 ) : AT_EMPTY_PATH support , this makes it possible to use utimensat on an O_PATH file ( including symlinks ) commit Allow unprivileged whiteout creation commit Have syncfs ( ) return error when there are writeback errors commit , commit statx ( 2 ) : add mount ID commit and mount_root commit

4. Memory management
( FEATURED ) Balance LRU lists based on relative thrashing :
The reclaim code that balances between swapping and cache reclaim tries to predict likely reuse based on in - memory reference patterns alone .
The balancing code has been tuned over time to a point where it mostly goes for page cache and defers swapping until the VM is under significant memory pressure .
Since commit a528910e12ec
Linux has exact tracking of refault IO - the ultimate cost of reclaiming the wrong pages .
This allows us to use an IO cost based balancing model that is more aggressive about scanning anonymous memory when the cache is thrashing , while being able to avoid unnecessary swap storms commit , commit , commit , commit , commit , commit , commit , commit , commit , commit , commit , commit , commit , commit
swap : speed up swapoff by properly updating readahead statistics commit

5 . Block layer
loop : Add LOOP_CONFIGURE ioctl .
This allows userspace to completely setup a loop device with a single ioctl , removing the in - between state where the device can be partially configured commit
Add support for Inline Encryption to the block layer .
Inline Encryption hardware allows software to specify an encryption context ( an encryption key , crypto algorithm , data unit num , data unit size , etc. ) along with a data transfer request to a storage device , and the inline encryption hardware will use that context to en / decrypt the data .
The inline encryption hardware is part of the storage device , and it conceptually sits on the data path between system memory and the storage device commit , commit , commit , commit , commit

11.2 . X86
Fixes for the new SRBDS security issue .
SRBDS is an MDS - like speculative side channel that can leak bits from the random number generator ( RNG ) across cores and threads .
New microcode serializes the processor access during the execution of RDRAND and RDSEED .
This ensures that the shared buffer is overwritten before it is released for reuse .
This is equivalent to a full bus lock , which means that many threads running the RNG instructions in parallel have the same effect as the same amount of threads issuing a locked instruction targeting an address which requires locking of two cachelines at once commit , commit , commit , commit
Add an initrdmem= option to specify initrd physical address commit

Dem councilman wants to stalk legal patrons of strip club David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Friday December 5 , 2008
Print This Email This Early Obama backer seeks administration job
A New York City councilman who objects to the image of a scantily - clad woman which looms over a strip club in a residential neighborhood has decided to take the law into his own hands by photographing patrons of the club and posting the pictures online .
Councilman James Sanders Jr. , a Queens Democrat , told the hosts of Fox & Friends on Friday , " We 're going to creative civil disobedience to ensure that everybody who goes into that club has a picture taken , and if they are proud to go into the club , we are proud to put it on the web . "
" The only problem is that legally , you may not be able to do that , " commented host Gretchen Carlson .
The billboard above the club entrance , which depicts a woman whose full breasts are covered only by a narrow strip of cloth over the nipples , is no more revealing than many comic book and video game images .
However , Fox News , which showed the full image in the first tease for the story , later pixelated over the breast area and cropped the bottom , creating the impression that the figure might be nude and making the image appear far more lurid .
" We have children , " Councilman Sanders explained in justification of his actions .
" And any time anyone puts a 25 foot tall display , that they call a sign , on a major intersection where our children have to go to school -- this insult to women , this insult to our community -- we 're going to take action . "
" We did a mass meeting and had more than 300 people there , " Sanders added .
" In fact , they wanted to take worse actions than I 'm speaking about .
We 're going to keep this legal . "
Fox 's legal expert , Judge Andrew Napolitano , then came onto the set , saying , " I have been watching this , and unfortunately the first amendment has some things to say about it . "
Sanders acknowledged that " the club is a legal establishment and they are obeying all of the zoning laws , " but he continued to claim , " They can advertise , they just do n't have to inflict pornography on us . "
" Under New York State law , " Napolitano explained , " it 's not pornographic .
...
And as repellant as the business is , it 's a lawful business . "
" There are community standards , " Sanders insisted , " and in our community this is not part of the standards . "
" If you want to argue that it violates the community standards , then you have to go to court and get a judge to agree , " Napolitano stated .
" In my opinion , it 's not pornographic , because New York 's law is very , very , very broad . "
" Where have we come , if that 's not pornographic ? "
Carlson asked .
" It looks pretty pornographic to me . "
Billboards which publicly push the grounds of good taste have recently raised protests in major cities from Cleveland to Toronto and have been the subject of campaigns by conservative religious groups .
Actor turned born - again Christian Stephen Baldwin attracted attention in 2006 when he announced plans to photograph patrons of a sex shop outside Nyack , NY .
Sanders , described by the Daily News as " a former Marine with a maverick reputation , " gained attention last spring by campaigning for Barack Obama while most New York City Democrats were supporting Hillary Clinton .
The News reported at that time that Sanders was hoping for a job in Washington if Obama won -- and that contenders for his council seat might include both his ex-wife and his current wife , who is his former chief of staff .

ROME  Italians never quite know whether to laugh or cry at Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi .
But many reacted with incredulity and outrage after the prime minister , visiting Moscow on Thursday , amiably called the first African - American president - elect in United States history “ young , handsome and suntanned . ”
Mr. Berlusconi made the remark while meeting President Dmitri A. Medvedev of Russia , saying that Senator Barack Obama ’s good looks , his youth and his so - called suntan were “ all the qualities ” for Mr. Medvedev and the future president to “ develop a good working relationship . ”
Many Italian newspapers gave the comment nearly as much front - page attention as Mr. Obama ’s victory itself .
The journalist Curzio Maltese wrote in the center - left La Repubblica that “ bookmakers would n’t even take bets ” on how long it would take for Mr. Berlusconi to let slip another of his famous gaffes .
“ Mr. Berlusconi never fails to live up to our worst expectations . ”
Mr. Maltese added that just when Mr. Obama ’s victory was “ inspiring billions of people ” to consider “ democracy , the most extraordinary triumph of humanity after centuries of bloodshed and intolerance , ” Mr. Berlusconi instead contributed “ a miserable , vulgar and racist remark , for which he did n’t even have the courage to take responsibility or the dignity to apologize . ”

The Art of Self - Reference in Video Games [ 11.25.08 ]
- Matthew Weise
" One of the worst annoyances of video gaming is the designers who want to show off how clever they are .
Interrupting the players ' immersion in order to remind them ‘ Do n't forget , it 's only a game ! ' may be the designers being playful , but the game is supposed to provide gameplay for the players , not for the designers .
Such cute gimmicks do n't improve the players ' experience ; they harm it .
It 's a direct slap in the face . "
— Ernest Adams in " Postmodernism and the Three Types of Immersion "
The above quote represents , to my mind , an important controversy in video games .
When a game is self - referential , when it acknowledges the technological apparatus of the computer , it can have a profound effect on player experience .
As far as game designer Ernest Adams is concerned , this effect is negative , inevitably shattering the fictional reality of the game and rendering it impossible to take seriously .
I do n't agree with this position .
Self - reference in games is not an inherently destructive act .
As game scholar Rune Klevjer asserts , " game fictions are not delineated by a ' fourth wall ' as they are in film or literature . "
The fourth wall is , of course , a term from theater that has become shorthand for the boundary between fiction and audience in a variety of media .
But applying this term to video games , Klevjer would argue , is a mistake because the line between reality and fiction in games does not function as it does in traditional media .
It is useful to think about the boundary between player and fiction as an elastic membrane -- a threshold -- rather than a wall , like Adams does .
Drawing attention to how this threshold functions through self - reference can actually enhance fiction rather than destroy it .
It can draw the player and game fiction together rather than driving them apart .
Self - Referential Games
There is a certain conventional point of view that states a video game should do anything and everything possible to make its technological apparatus invisible to the player in order to maintain a better sense of immersion .
This view is largely responsible for the growing trend of " invisible " user interfaces in games such as Peter Jackson 's King Kong ( Ubisoft 2005 ) or Mirror 's Edge ( Electronic Arts 2008 ) .
In these titles , traditional graphic overlays such as health meters are avoided .
Instead , the necessary information is communicated to the player in a supposedly more immersive visual manner , such as the screen turning red to indicate damage .
What Adams is complaining about is n't the existence of graphical interfaces , though .
His main problem is with games that admit , within the fiction of the game world itself , that they are games .
The particular game that offends Adams is Metal Gear Solid ( Konami 1998 ) , a game in which characters throughout the story make numerous references to the game apparatus , specifically the controller .
In one of many such moments , the game 's protagonist , Solid Snake , encounters a psychic boss character , Psycho Mantis , who implores him to " put his controller on the floor " so he can move it with his mind .
Psycho Mantis also claims he can " read "
Snake 's memory card to see what games he likes and comments on the prudence or recklessness of his saving habits .
Adams concludes :
" I do n't know enough about Japanese culture to say whether MGS 's self - referential nature was an attempt to be postmodern .
But I do stand by my original assertion that it 's out of place in a story of adventure . "
Postmodernism is a tricky concept ( and one that I will not deal with in detail here ) because in reality , it involves much more than just self - reference .
It extends into entire schools of thought on art , architecture , politics .
Adams uses the term much more simply , as a kind of shorthand for video games with self - referential habits .
Games like Metal Gear Solid cannot hide behind the veil of postmodernism , he seems to be saying , and expect users to be moved , excited , or otherwise emotionally engaged by a story .
This is , of course , my own guess as to what Adams thinks it means to take a game seriously .
To take a game seriously , one can imagine , is to believe that what happens to characters is meaningful and real within the sealed bubble that contains the fictional universe of its story .
If certain graphical interface elements , like life meters , are projected on the surface , it 's not a problem as long as the characters below do n't notice .
However , if the characters do notice , the whole bubble pops .
Reality and fiction , at least in Adams ' mind , do not mix .
From the moment Snake 's commanding officer in Metal Gear Solid mentions the " action " button , the story is finished .
It is proof that Snake 's world is n't real , so why should we care ?

Editor 's Note : Daniel J. Mitchell is a senior fellow at the Cato Institute , a libertarian public policy research foundation .
He formerly worked at The Heritage Foundation and as an economist for Republican Sen. Bob Packwood and the Senate Finance Committee .
He also served on the 1988 Bush - Quayle transition team .
Daniel Mitchell says an auto bailout would subsidize bad management and reward inflexible unions .
( CNN ) -- General Motors , Ford , Chrysler and the United Auto Workers union are pouring millions of dollars into a lobbying campaign for a taxpayer bailout .
The money devoted to influence peddling in Washington would be better spent on improving quality and finding ways to reduce a bloated cost structure , but both management and UAW have decided that fleecing taxpayers is a better option .
A taxpayer bailout would be a terrible mistake .
It would subsidize the shoddy management practices of the corporate bureaucrats at General Motors , Ford and Chrysler , and it would reward the intransigent union bosses who have made the synonymous with inflexible and anti-competitive work rules .
Perhaps most important , though , is that a bailout would be bad for the long - term health of the American auto industry .
It would discriminate against the 113,000 Americans who have highly - coveted jobs building cars for Nissan , BMW and other auto companies that happen to be headquartered in other nations .
These companies demonstrate that it is possible to build cars in America and make money .
Putting them at a competitive disadvantage with handouts for the U.S. - headquartered companies would be highly unjust .
A bailout also would be bad for General Motors , Ford and Chrysler .
The so - called Big Three desperately need to fundamentally restructure their practices .
More specifically , the car companies need to endure some short - term pain in order to restore long - term viability .
But that wo n't happen if politicians raid the treasury .
Getting access to taxpayer money would be akin to giving an alcoholic the key to a liquor cabinet .
It also would be bad for American taxpayers and the American economy .
For instance :
• A bailout will hurt the overall economy by misallocating resources .
When politicians grant special favors to a certain industry or a particular union , such decisions necessarily mean that market forces are being replaced by special - interest deal - making .
This type of interference with free markets is why nations such as France , Germany and Japan tend to grow more slowly and enjoy less prosperity .
But if America goes down this same path of government intervention , it is inevitable that we will suffer the same fate of stagnation and higher unemployment .
• A bailout will encourage other industries to seek taxpayer handouts .
The Wall Street bailout was a disaster in many ways , most notably as measured by the weak stock market and economic volatility .
But another negative aspect of the bailout is that other industries have now decided that it is OK to stick their snouts in the public trough , as well .
First Wall Street 's high fliers get a bailout .
Now the inefficient management and union at the Big Three want a handout .
Who will be next in line to pillage taxpayers ?
Giving handouts in exchange for political support is akin to getting high .
Once politicians decide they like the buzz of campaign contributions , they 'll turn into junkies with ordinary Americans footing the bill .
• A bailout is a perverse transfer from poor taxpayers to rich taxpayers .
America 's Founding Fathers surely never envisaged that the federal government would take money from one group of Americans and give it to another group .
Yet much of the federal budget is devoted to redistribution programs .
Bailouts are a particularly bizarre form of redistribution , however , because the corporate bureaucrats at the Big Three are among the very richest Americans .
The UAW bosses make extravagant salaries , as well , and even regular union workers make an average total compensation including benefits of approximately $ 70 per hour , far higher than the average American .
The government should not be in the business of giving unearned wealth to any group of citizens , but surely liberals and conservatives both can agree that politicians should not be taking money from middle class taxpayers and giving it to upper - middle class and rich taxpayers .
Advocates oftentimes admit that bailouts are not good policy , but they invariably argue that short - term considerations should trump long - term sensible policy .
Their biggest assertion is that a bailout is necessary to prevent bankruptcy , and that avoiding this result is critical to prevent catastrophe .
But Chapter 11 protection may be precisely what is needed to put American auto companies back on the path to profitability .
Bankruptcy laws specifically are designed to give companies an opportunity - under court supervision - to reduce costs and streamline operations .
Bankruptcy would not be popular in some quarters , to be sure .
The bloated management structure would be streamlined and many overpaid executives would be unhappy about having to find new jobs .
The UAW would be equally upset , particularly since bankruptcy might force an end to extravagant pension benefits and inefficient workplace practices .
But bankruptcy is akin to getting an alcoholic to put down the bottle .
There clearly will be short - term discomfort , but compassionate people recognize that this is the best approach .
America is on a dangerous path .
The Wall Street bailout was a mistake .
It transferred a huge amount of money from the productive sector of the economy to the government , and also exacerbated " moral hazard " by rewarding companies and executives who made dumb decisions .
But this may be the tip of the iceberg .
A bailout of U.S. - headquartered auto companies also would be a mistake , as would bailouts of homeowners or any other constituency .
If politicians genuinely want to help the economy , they should focus on reducing the burden of government , not increasing it .
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Daniel Mitchell .

I have found a new toy !
It is called Clojure .
What is it ?
It is a Lisp dialect that runs on the JVM .
Hey , hey , where are you going !
Crap !
Around 85 % of the readers just left the site in disgust .
Some of them have probably un-subscribed from my feed as soon as they saw the word lisp .
Oh well , well have to finish this without them .
What ’s wrong with Common Lisp you say ?
Nothing wrong with it .
But if you take a language and put it on top of JVM you now have double the amount of power .
Here is the thing about programming languages .
No matter which one you pick , it will be missing some library or functionality you will need for your project .
It ’s always a different thing that is missing , but you will never get a language that has everything .
And that ’s ok .
The JVM languages however have the advantage of being able to tap into the incredibly rich Java API , or to seamlessly invoke stuff written in other JVM languages such as Java , Jython , Javascript ( with Rhino ) and etc . .
This gives you a great deal of power and flexibility as you can imagine .
This is why I love Rhino which allows me to produce Java compatible code without actually using the Java syntax .
Clojure will allow me to do the same thing but with Lisp .
Of course there other JVM implementations of lisp such as Armed Bear Common Lisp ( ABCL ) or Second Interpreter for Scheme Code ( SISC ) .
All of these are fine , but I like Clojure because it seems to be a very progressive project .
Instead of simply porting CLISP or Scheme to JVM they decided to create their own flavor , one built from the ground up with Concurrency and Java interop in mind .
Traditional lisps do n’t do concurrent programming .
Since JVM has a great theading support so some of their implementations ( like SISC ) try to graft it in .
But they are bound by backward compatibility and other concerns so the results may vary .
Clojure on the other threads it ’s own path , abandoning some traditional conventions and implementing modern ideas .
For one it is strongly concurrent , providing interesting abstractions for dealing with synchronous and asynchronous data access problems .
Correct me if I ’m wrong but I do not thing that any other lisp implementation has such a through and well thought out threading support .
But that ’s not all .
Clojure natively implements modern data structures such as hash maps and vectors making them behave as functions .
Let me show you and example :
( def a ( hash - map " foo " " bar " " biz " " bif " ) ) ( a " foo " ) ; returns ' bar '
The language also extends standard lispy sequence functions such as map and filter to all objects that implement the Java iterable interface .
So you can easily apply them to all the crazy custom data structures from your legacy code base .
It also supports attaching metadata to your objects .
It allows you to associate arbitrary map ( eg. hash - map ) to an object which does not affect that objects hash for comparison purposes , and does n’t count as part of that object but which can be accessed at any time from within your code .
There is more stuff there but you can read about it on the Closure homepage .
The point is that this feels like a new , vibrant language that is going places .
When you work with CLISP or Scheme you are dealing with a mature , and pretty much static language .
They are pretty much set in stone at this point , and they are very reluctant of introducing new features .
Clojure on the other hand is in active development , and is constantly being improved .
It has a thriving community , a well maintained wiki page and a clearly defined set of goals and philosophy .
It is a very exciting project – and one of the very few times , that someone is doing some new and exciting things with Lisp .
It is a good idea to keep an eye on it .
I ’m not saying it will become the next big language .
I mean , come on – it ’s lisp .
But it does take lisp into new and interesting directions which is a good thing and for one I ’m excited about it .
If you want to start messing around with it , you will need to do three things :
First download the clojure .jar and put it somewhere Second download jline .
jar and put it in the same directory ( if you skip this part you wo n’t have history , and left / right arrow support in the console interpreter )
Make put this bash script somewhere in your path :
#!/bin/bash CLOJURE_DIR=/path/to/clojure
CLOJURE_JAR=$CLOJURE_DIR/clojure.jar if [ - z " $ 1 " ] ; then java - cp $ CLOJURE_DIR/jline.jar:$CLOJURE_JAR jline.ConsoleRunner clojure.lang .
Repl else java - cp $ CLOJURE_JAR clojure.lang .
Script $ 1 fi
This will allow you to invoke the command line interpreter by calling your script without any arguments , or run a script provided on the command line .
That ’s all you really need to get started .
Or you can just run it from the command line but as with many of these JVM language things these invocations tend to get way to long to type them in by hand each time .
So if you are a Lisp person , or you are interested in learning some lisp go and check it out .
You do n’t need to install anything .
Just download few files , put them in a temporary diectory and start plugging away .
If you do n’t like it , delete them and your done .
How easy is that ?
The risk of giving birth to babies with genetic defects as a result of marriages between first cousins is no greater than that run by women over 40 who become pregnant , according to two scientists who call for the taboo on first - cousin families to be lifted .
Women in their forties are not made to feel guilty about having babies and the same should apply to cousins who want to marry , said Professor Diane Paul of the University of Massachusetts in Boston and Professor Hamish Spencer of the University of Otago in Dunedin , New Zealand .
Although first - cousin marriages are legal in Britain , there have been calls to ban the practice because of reports that it has resulted in a higher - than - average incidence of birth defects in certain immigrant communities where it is common and culturally acceptable .
However , Professors Paul and Spencer said that the risk of congenital defects is about 2 per cent higher than average for babies born to first - cousin marriages – with the infant mortality about 4.4 per cent higher – which is on a par with the risk to babies born to women over 40 .
" Women over the age of 40 have a similar risk of having children with birth defects and no one is suggesting they should be prevented from reproducing , " said Professor Spencer , whose co-authored study is published in the online journal Public Library of Science .

First - cousin marriages were once quite common in Europe , especially among the elite – Charles Darwin married his first cousin Emma Wedgwood – but that changed in the late 19th - century as people , especially women , became more socially mobile and the risks became more evident .
The stigma attached to first - cousin marriages was supported by early studies into human genetics suggesting that " recessive " versions of a gene ( which are not expressed unless there are two of them , one from each parent ) are more likely to be expressed in the children of genetically related parents , as well as more likely to be defective .
Most states in America have either outlawed or restricted the practice , as has China , Taiwan and both North and South Korea .
Professor Spencer , an evolutionary zoologist , said these laws should be repealed , especially in America , where he said they were drafted in a way that discriminated against the rural poor and immigrants : " Neither the scientific nor social assumptions behind such legislation stand up to close scrutiny .
Such legislation reflects outmoded prejudices about immigrants and the rural poor and relies on over - simplified views of heredity .
There is no scientific grounding for it . "
In the UK , the issue came to the fore when the MP Phil Woolas , now the Immigration minister , claimed earlier this year that first - cousin marriages within Asian communities in Britain resulted in an increasing number of children with health problems .
" A lot of arranged marriages are with first cousins , and that produces lots of genetic problems in terms of disability [ in children ] , " Mr Woolas said .
Peter Corry of St Luke 's Hospital in Bradford estimates that among people of Pakistani descent in the city , 55 per cent of whom marry first cousins , the risk of recessive genetic disorders – the type due to related parents – is between 10 and 15 times higher than in the general population .
A 2004 study found that 13 out of 1,000 Asian children born in the Bradford area had inherited recessive disorders , which can lead to disabilities .

Tired of the same bland battles over and over again ?
Want to shake them up a bit so your players need to look at the battlefield in a new way , perhaps even make it part of the combat ?
Well then , this is the post you ’ve been waiting for !
Here are some new , and possibly some clichéd , battle scenarios you can try out in your games .
And yes , they are slanted towards fantasy games in most cases .
Feel free to adapt as necessary .
1 ) On the ice .
Or perhaps on a bunch of icebergs .
Ice is fun because it ’s slippery , and that can make for some interesting changes in the combat dynamics .
In addition , if there ’s some thin ice around , it could make things tactically interesting in trying to force your opponents to that area .
Perhaps if you fail a charging attack , you ’ll find yourself moving further past your enemy than you hoped you would .
And then there are other tactics , like blowing a hole in the ice below your opponents … and hoping it does n’t cause enough damage to get the ice under you too .
If you ’re doing battle on icebergs , you likely wo n’t be breaking enough ice to drop your opponents in the drink , but forcing them over the edge is an option .
So is a chase from iceberg to iceberg if you ’re looking for a non-standard chase scene .
Also , fire spells to melt the ice followed by ice spells to refreeze it might be useful in binding your opponents … or a way for the enemies to stop the PCs in their tracks for a few rounds .
2 ) While on a floating island crashing to the world below .
Yeah , I totally ripped this off from Sonic games , but so what ?
It could be an interesting scenario .
If you do n’t want an island , it could just as easily be a flying castle or fortress , or anything sufficiently large that can fall .
While this likely wo n’t change the battle dynamics much , it will add quite a bit of tension to the battle .
In addition , if the battle does n’t end in time , you ’ll have the fun experience of crashing into the ground and watching the island / fortress break apart … with you still on it and likely feeling the effects of a crash landing .
Perhaps the battle even continues after that point to keep things interesting .
3 ) Flying through the Astral Plane .
On the Astral Plane , all sorts of things are different .
Everyone already has a good deal of mobility .
They ’re also incorporeal , though it ’s likely their opponents are as well , so it ’s unlikely that will effect much .
However , since the Astral Plane is heavily shaped by thought , it ’s entirely possible that the thoughts of the PCs and their enemies reshape the battlefield .
For instance , a character remembering that time he fought a dragon might bring an astral dragonlike entity into existence to breathe fire on friend and foe alike for a turn .
You can have some real fun with this , as anything from the past can become a temporary battlefield hazard .
Of course , this will depend heavily on the campaign you ’re running , and how the Astral Plane fits into it .
4 ) “ In the middle of a rope - bridge over a river of molten lava is not even worth considering . ”
Perhaps this is true if you ’re an evil overlord , but to me , it sounds like a fantastic battle .
Limited movement for anyone stuck on the ground , a shaky battle platform , and a hot fiery end below for anyone who makes a misstep during the battle .
Severely limits the heavy artillery , since if the bridge goes , so do any allies on it .
Then again , a cut the bridge down and run strategy could make for a fun escape if done successfully .
But there ’s something to be said for fighting this one out traditionally until the bridge buckles from being overused .
Of course , that ’s only a couple possibilities out of many , and the bridge suspended over lava will certainly add to the atmosphere , no matter where the battle goes from there .
5 ) It ’s a dark and stormy night at sea .
And then your ship capsizes .
Then you see the giant krakken ( or other appropriately challenging sea creature ) .
Now , part of the fun in this battle is that the players are at a distinct disadvantage when it comes to mobility starting out .
Naturally , casters will even the odds in a round or two , but that ’s what casters are for .
With flying , water walking , water breathing , and countless other possibilities , including just swimming and fighting , the battle could go any number of ways .
Water can really mess with a combat too .
For those in the water , they have to maneuver through stormy seas while fighting .
For those walking on top of it , it will be hard to keep their footing as the water is constantly shifting .
For those flying above it , they have to get their attacks through the water somehow .
This will nullify a lot of casting options from the start .
Fireballs tend to stop when they hit water , unless they were cast while underwater … an undertaking that , though possible , has it ’s own issues .
Lightning spells will be interesting too , given the way water conducts electricity .
Archers will also have issues , as water resistance will make their arrows difficult to aim .
The warrior types will find their bulky armor more a burden than a help at this point in time , unless they receive some timely magical aid .
So there you have five battle scenarios you can try out in your game if you need a new combat scene to change things up a bit .
Have any favorites you ’d like to add to this list ?
Tell me about them in the comments !

2008 has not been a happy year for web security , especially regarding trust you can have in the identity of web site you 're visiting :
The implications of the 3rd and 4th scenarios are scary : as long as these issues stand , trusting internet transactions is an act of faith .
CAs definitely need to move their asses , performing and proving their due diligence on " basic validation " when issuing a proof of identity ( which a certificate is ) , rather than focusing on overpriced " premium services " .
Obsolete technologies like MD5 in SSL certificates must be deprecated and banned , both by CAs and browser vendors , as soon as possible .
In the meanwhile , there 's not much we as end - users can do , other than checking for a sudden and unjustified change in the SSL certificate of a site we usually do business with , and that 's not simple either , because there 's no built - in browser alert of the kind we 've got in SSH clients , for instance .
Anyway , some help can come from the Perspectives add - on for Firefox .
Even if Perspective 's primary and most advertised aim is enabling SSH - style certificate " validation " for self - signed certificates ( those not issued by an established certification authority ) , it can be configured to act a second validation layer for CA - signed certificates too , by checking their consistency from multiple internet nodes ( called " Notaries " ) and / or over time :
Install the Perspectives add - on ( if you are not a Firefox user , get Firefox first ) .
Open the Tools|Add - Ons Firefox 's menu item , then select the Perspectives row and click the Options button .
In the Preferences panel of the Perspective options window , check Contact Notaries for all HTTPS sites .
.
Optionally clear the Allow Perspectives to automatically override security errors checkbox if you 're not interested in managing self - signed certificates .
checkbox if you 're not interested in managing self - signed certificates .
Optionally modify , in the Security Settings box , the required quorum ( the fraction of Notaries which must agree ) and the number of days this quorum must have been reach for .
This way you should obtain some protection against rogue but " valid " certificates .
Happy new year !
Meraki Releases World 's First Solar - Powered WiFi Device
December 5th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
Yesterday , wireless networking provider Meraki started shipping the world ’s first solar - powered WiFi mesh device .
Meraki ’s groundbreaking energy - independent device is powered by a single solar panel and solar - charged battery .
Since the unit requires no grid - derived energy , it can be set up in areas lacking power supplies , like parks , golf courses , rural areas , and resorts .
With a price range of $ 848 to $ 1,497 , Meraki ’s set - up is n’t exactly cheap .
It is , however , cheaper than most other outdoor wireless network installations .
The most expensive item in outdoor wireless networks is often the electrical cabling installation — a step that is n’t necessary for the Meraki unit since it uses a solar - powered battery .
Meraki ’s battery is made up of lithium iron phosphate for fast recharging and high - power density .
The company provides a web - based dashboard to monitor charging .
While the Meraki device ’s release may not impact you directly just yet , start looking for wireless popping up in unexpected places in the near future .

Latest Cleantech Talk Episode
The animal kingdom has gained a cousin and lost a mother .
In a fundamental reconfiguration of the tree of life , scientists now say that the last common animal ancestor is not — as was commonly believed — a sponge or comb jelly , but rather an as - yet - unknown forerunner of amoeba - like creatures called placozoans .
" It 's a question that has plagued animal biologists for a couple hundred years :
What could be the mother of all animals ? " said Rob DeSalle , an evolutionary biologist at the American Museum of Natural History .
" We 've turned it upside down . "
Since Carl Linnaeus put life in taxonomic order in 1735 , scientists have proposed a variety of original or ur - animals , from Ernst Haeckel 's hypothetical , embryo - like gastraea to larval jellyfish called planula .
But in recent years , zoologists have favored either sponges or comb jellies as occupying a bifurcation point between Bilateria — creatures with bilateral symmetry , including humans and most of the animal kingdom — and the jellyfish , corals and polyps belonging collectively to Cnidaria .
Those hypotheses were based on relatively rough comparisons of anatomy and a handful of genes .
Molecular sequencing and supercomputer - enabled data analysis give biologists a clearer picture of life 's narrative — but DeSalle 's analysis , published Monday in Public Library of Science Biology , has merely moved the mystery to another level .
Comb jellies and sponges do n't appear to have predated Bilateria , but rather belong with Cnidaria in a single branch of the animal kingdom , originating in the lowly placozoans .
But while some scientists , among them DeSalle , thought that placozoa might represent the last common ancestor of all animals , it appears to belong solely to this newly defined branch , leaving the ur-animal shrouded in mystery .
" It fits in with what you might think is the most basal animal .
It 's only got three cell layers and four cell types .
Its motility is primitive .
It lives in warm oceans .
It 's got all the earmarks of the thing that gave rise to all animal life , " said DeSalle .
" But that 's not what the results show .
And though placozoa is the ur - cousin of complicated life , we still do n't know the ur-mother . "
DeSalle 's team fed data on 9,400 biological characteristics — from mitochondrial and nuclear DNA
sequences to RNA molecular structure — from 70 species spanning every major class of animal on Earth into a program that searched for patterns of relationships , determining which order made linear sense .
Out of this came the new tree , with DeSalle 's would - be ur - animal at the start of one branch .
Identified just 100 years ago crawling on an aquarium wall , placozoans have not even been studied in their ocean habitat , but its genome was sequenced in 2008 .
University of Texas taxonomist David Hillis called placozoa " among the most interesting animals that almost no one has ever heard about , " but was less enthusiastic about the conclusion , which he said " represents a fine distinction in how we reconstruct the ancestral animal . "
But such fine distinctions are fascinating to DeSalle .
Since placozoa do n't have a nervous system and jellyfish do , the findings suggest that nervous systems evolved at least twice , independently of each other .
This insight could stimulate research that provides a deeper understanding of our own nervous systems .
" Evolution has done all these experiments , and when you reconstruct common ancestors , you 're reconstructing the results of the experiment , "
said DeSalle .
" If you want to look at the development of our brains , of our nervous system , of anything we have as a result of experiments that nature has done , the best way to do it is to reconstruct our ancestors . "
DeSalle said a common animal ancestor is likely to come from Deuterostomia , a group of phyla that includes sea cucumbers .

Advertisement A US military F - 18 fighter jet has crashed into a residential area of San Diego , killing three people on the ground and injuring the pilot .
The San Diego Fire Department described the scene of the crash as " a heavily populated area " near Interstate 805 .
TV footage showed plumes of white smoke rising from several houses .
The Federal Aviation Administration said the jet had crashed as it prepared to land at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar and that the pilot had ejected .
The crash occurred two miles ( 3.2 km ) from the base , it added .
Personnel from Air Station Miramar , famous for its role in the movie Top Gun , have been dispatched to the crash site to investigate .
The Marine Corps said the jet , a two - seater F / A - 18D Hornet , had been on a training mission with only one pilot on board .
Mayor Jerry Sanders and a military official sent out their condolences to the families of the victims , whose identities have yet to be released .
' Out of control ' FAA spokesman Ian Gregor said the supersonic fighter had gone down in the University City area of San Diego at about 1200 ( 2000 GMT ) .
Both houses were totally engulfed in flames ...
I saw one pilot walking around and he was dazed
Donny James , witness
In pictures : San Diego jet crash Kurt Miller , who lives a few blocks from the crash site , told the BBC he had seen the jet coming in and thought it " seemed a little low " .
" I did not notice billowing black smoke from the engines or anything , however there were some noticeable fumes , which I originally just thought was exhaust , " he said .
" I did not realise until about 40 minutes later , on my way back to work , that they jet had actually crashed ... barely missing the local high school . "
Donny James , who was visiting the area , said the jet had " spiralled out of control , just like out of Top Gun " before coming down .
He said he was unable to get closer to the scene because two houses were on fire .
One was destroyed and another was badly damaged , he added .
" Both houses were totally engulfed in flames .
I saw a pilot walking around and he was dazed .
The police were telling everyone to get out of the way , " Mr James told CNN .
The pilot ejected before the crash and there was no ordnance on board Debris from the aircraft , including one of its engines , is strewn around the neighbourhood , reports say .
Officials have urged anybody who finds any parts to leave them and report them to authorities .
Witnesses said the pilot had landed in a tree close to the crash site .
He was later taken to Balboa Naval Hospital with injuries , officials said .
The BBC's Rajesh Mirchandani in Los Angeles says there have been concerns voiced by local people in the past about the frequency of flights by military aircraft over residential areas in California .

有川 （中略）例えばアニメで、小牧と毬江のエピソードが地上波で放送されなかったのは、毬江が聴覚障害者だという設定だったからなんです。毬江のエピソードはＴＶではできません、ということがアニメ化の大前提だったんです。それを了承してもらわないと『図書館戦争』はアニメ化できません、と真っ先に言われたことがとても衝撃的でした。（後略）
やはり。原作では印象的なキャラクターである毬江がテレビに出てこなかったのは、そういう裏があるのではないかと思っていたのだが。
ちなみに 、ＤＶＤの３巻には毬江の登場するテレビ未放映話「恋ノ障害」が収録されているのだそうだ。
これが
原作を読まずにテレビ版しか見ていない人は、そもそもメディア良化委員会が何のためにどんな基準で本を狩っているのか、よく分からなかったのではないだろうか。単純に体制に批判的な本だけを弾圧していると思っていたのではないか。
原作で重要な役割を果たすのが、『レインツリーの国』という小説である。主人公の笠原郁は高校時代、この本を書店で買おうとして、良化隊に取り上げられそうになった。そこを堂上に助けられたことが、彼女に図書隊への入隊を決意させるきっっかけになったのだ。
『レインツリーの国』は『図書館戦争』のスピンオフ作品として、作者自身によって執筆された。お読みになればお分かりだろうが、美しい恋愛小説である。しかし、ヒロインが聴覚障害者であり、「違反語」が使われているという理由で、『図書館戦争』の世界ではこの本が狩られているのである。
『図書館戦争』の世界は絵空事ではない。現実に起きていることだ。この話をリアリティがないと思うのは、出版界や放送界の実状を知らない人だろう。
『図書館戦争』の世界と違うのは、「違反語」リストを作り、それに従って言葉を狩っているのが、政府が作った良化委員会ではなく、出版界や放送界自身だということ。「メディア良化委員会」とは、実はメディアそのものなのである。
僕自身の体験を書こう。
2006 年10 月、 『 ＴＶブロス』のカンヌ映画祭についての記事の中で、ライターが露骨な差別表現を使ったという事件があった。ライターもライターだが、通してしまった編集者も不注意である。要するに差別問題に関する知識も関心も自覚もまるでなかったわけで、問題になるのは当たり前だ。
ところがその一件で、大手出版社がいっせいに過剰反応した。それまでＯＫだった、どうということはない表現にまで、過敏にチェックが入るようになったのだ。
そのとばっちりが僕にも来た。ちょうど『神は沈黙せず』の文庫版のゲラチェックをやっていたのだが、いったん戻したゲラに、校閲者による膨大な数のチェックが入って戻ってきたのである。どれも単行本ではまったく問題にならなかった箇所だ。修正しろという命令ではないが、あらためて表現に一考をお願いする……というのである。
どんな表現にチェックが入ったか、実例を挙げよう。
>ネットに流れた情報だけを盲信した人々が
>精神病院に入院させられているとか
>地球が狂いはじめているのではないだろうか
>狂信的な熱情にかられて行動した
>たちまち悪臭漂うスラムと化した
>自分の中にも狂気がひそんでいる可能性
>強いボスに盲従する猿たち
>いみじくもドーキンスが言ったように、「盲目の時計職人（ブラインド・ウォッチメイカー）」なのだ。
>兄は狂っているのだろうか。
>よく発狂しなかったものだと
>悲しみのあまり狂乱したことも
>怒り狂った群集によって
>頭のおかしい人間が行なった未熟な犯行にすぎず
>ポルターガイストの荒れ狂う施設 ！
>熱狂的な加古沢ファン
>精神錯乱が多発した
>ファンの狂騒に踊らされることは決してなかった
>狂気と正気の境界線をどこに置くか
>狂気に蝕まれている自分に言い聞かせた
これでもチェック箇所のごく一部にすぎない。 つまり「狂 」 「盲」という字すべてにチェックが入っているのだ。たまらん。
だいたい『ブラインド・ウォッチメイカー』を他にどう訳せと？ つーか、「ブラインド」はＯＫ で「盲目」はダメという根拠は何だ？
いちばん笑ったのは 、
>私はぽかんと口を開けた。盲点だった。
「 盲点」にもチェックが!?（笑）そりゃ盲点だったわ。いやもうこれは床にひっくり返って笑ったよ。 のちに「七パーセントのテンムー」を書いた時に、ギャグのネタにさせていただいた。
>馬丁の娘
>老婆の横顔
という部分にもチェックが入った。「馬丁」も差別語とは知らなかった。つーか、これをどう言い換えろというのだ？
なぜ「老婆」が差別語認定されているのか、編集さんも首をひねっていた。おそらく、かつて「婆あ」という侮蔑的表現が問題になったことがあって、そこから拡大解釈して「婆」という漢字すべてを自粛することになったのではないかと想像するが、今となっては真相は分からない。
>電波系
>サイコキラー
という単語にもチェックが入った。「サイコ」という言葉がまずいらしいのだ。冗談じゃない！
ヒッチコックの映画はどうなるんだ!?
だいたい、「サイコキラー」なんて言葉、日常的に使ってるだろ。
>かなり節操のない日本的キリスト教徒だったようだ
という部分にもチェック。「『日本のキリスト教徒は節操がない』と誤読されるおそれがあるのでは？」というのである。いねーよ、そんなひねくれた誤読する奴。お前だけだよ。
>日本各地の福祉施設に収容された何千人もの子供たち
という部分にもチェックが入った。「収容」という言葉がいかんので「預けられた」に改めろと指示された。なぜ？ 分からん。
さらに笑えたのが、アメリカ国内でイスラム原理主義者やキリスト教右翼によるテロが起きるというくだり。校正者の意見によれば、
「 フィクションですが、偏見を助長するおそれがあるのでは？」
アホかああああーっ ！
実在の集団による犯罪行為をフィクションの中で描いてはいかんというのなら、スパイ小説もポリティカル・フィクションも書けんようになるわーい！
出版業界で生きる人間が、自分の首絞めてバラバラにして埋葬するようなことを言い出すんじゃねえええーっ！
こんな箇所にもチェックが入った。
あるいは、ネットでベストセラーになったコミック『サンバーン』の作者、三崎純へのインタビューという話もあった。参考のために読んでみた私は、すぐに編集者に電話をかけ、「この仕事は別の人に回して」と依頼した。身障者の少女をレイプし、いじめ抜いた末に殺害する主人公の姿と、それをギャグを交えてあっけらかんと描く作者の姿勢は、私には反吐が出そうなほど不快だった。紙の本が出版物の主流で、出版業界のモラルが守られていた時代には、とうてい陽の目を見なかった作品だ。こんなものを描く人物がいることにも、それを夢中になって読む大衆がいることにも、やりきれなさを覚えた。
だからさ、主人公は差別意識に対する激しい怒りを表明してるんだよ？
あんたちゃんと文章の意味、理解してる？
25章のこんなくだりにもチェックが、
テキサス州アマリロの市庁舎では、玄関ホールの天井から長さ五メートルもある巨大な足がぬっと突き出した。職員や市民を驚かせただけで、すぐに消えてしまったものの、監視カメラには人間の一〇倍ぐらいのサイズがある白い素足がはっきり映っていた。明らかに黒人の足ではないことから、白人優越主義者はまたもや「神は白人であるという証明だ」と主張した。
ところがその四日後の夕刻、今度はニューメキシコ州フォート・サムナー郊外の住宅街に、巨大な裸の黒人が出現した。それは一〇人以上の目撃者たちの前で、身長一・二メートルから六メートルまで大きさを自由に変えたという。今度は黒人たちが「神はやっぱり黒人だった」と主張する番だった。
どこがまずいと思います？
なんと、 「黒人」という単語すべてにチェックが入ってるのである！ ええー、「黒人 」 もＮＧ 用語!? んなアホな！
『神は沈黙せず』をお読みになった方ならお分かりのように、この小説には僕自身の、身障者差別・人種差別・民族差別に対する強い嫌悪が随所に反映されている。
差別問題を扱うのだから当然、差別的発言をする人物も出てくるわけだが、それにすべてチェックが入った。「朝鮮の手先」「あつらは犯罪者ばっかりだ」とかである。
だからさ、この小説は差別を糾弾してる内容なのに、何でびくびして自粛しなきゃならんわけ？ おかしいじゃん！
最初は笑ってたが、だんだん腹が立ってきた。
この校閲者、自分では何も考えてない。機械的に「狂」
「盲」という字を検索して鉛筆でチェックを入れているだけである。ある表現が差別に当たるかどうか自分で判断することを放棄し、著者に全責任を押しつけている。それはつまり、「私は差別問題なんか分かりませーん」「責任とりたくありませーん」と宣言しているようなもんではないか。
そういう意識こそ差別なんだと、どうして気づかん!?
でもって、これまで小説の中で何度も差別問題を描いてきた僕が、何で今さら糾弾を恐れなくちゃなんないんですかい!?
こわくないよ、そんなの。万が一、人権団体に糾弾されたって、これまで自分が書いてきたものをずらっと並べて、「あなたの方こそ不勉強です。これを読んでください。僕はこういう作家です」と、逆に教育してやるよ。
こうした 「違反語狩り」が本当に差別をなくす目的ならいいことだろう。だが、現実は正反対だ。違反語リストを作って自主規制をしている人たちは、単純に言葉の言い替えで済ませているだけで、差別問題の本質など考えようとはしない。それどころか、障害者の抱える問題をリアルに描く作品や、差別を批判する内容の作品すら規制しようとする。
違反語狩りは差別問題への真摯な取り組みなどではなく、正反対である。現実に存在する問題から目をそむけ、口をつぐむことで、被差別者についての正しい理解が広まるのを妨げ、間接的に差別を助長しているのだ。
『別冊 図書館戦 争Ｉ』には木島ジンという作家が登場する。彼は反社会的、暴力的な作品ばかりを書いているが、婉曲表現ばかりで違反語をひとつも使っていないため、メディア良化法では取り締まることができない。彼は良化法に対する批判として、意図的にそうした小説を書き、社会に挑戦しているのである。
木島ジンというのは嫌な奴だと思う。しかし、言っていることは正論だ。違反語さえ使われていなければいいという問題ではない。それは『レインツリーの国』を読めばよく分かる。
『レインツリーの国』と木島ジンの作品は正反対だが、同じことを訴えている。前者は違反語を使ってはいる差別的ではなく、後者は違反語を使っていないが差別的である。
ある表現が差別的かどうかは文脈から判断するしかない。単語だけ取り出しても意味がない。こんな単純なことを理解できない――いや、理解しようとしない人間が大勢いる。
繰り返す。『図書館戦争』はリアルな話である。銃撃戦こそないものの、僕らはすでに『図書館戦争』の世界で生きているのだ。
『活字倶楽部』2008年秋号の有川浩ロングインタビューの中で、アニメ版『図書館戦争』のこんな裏話が披露されていた。やはり。原作では印象的なキャラクターである毬江がテレビに出てこなかったのは、そういう裏があるのではないかと思っていたのだが。ちなみに、ＤＶＤの３巻には毬江の登場するテレビ未放映話「恋ノ障害」が収録されているのだそうだ。これが アニメ版の毬江 の設定。声は植田佳奈か。うーん、テレビで見たかった。原作を読まずにテレビ版しか見ていない人は、そもそもメディア良化委員会が何のためにどんな基準で本を狩っているのか、よく分からなかったのではないだろうか。単純に体制に批判的な本だけを弾圧していると思っていたのではないか。『図書館戦争』の世界は絵空事ではない。現実に起きていることだ。この話をリアリティがないと思うのは、出版界や放送界の実状を知らない人だろう。『図書館戦争』の世界と違うのは、「違反語」リストを作り、それに従って言葉を狩っているのが、政府が作った良化委員会ではなく、出版界や放送界自身だということ。「メディア良化委員会」とは、実はメディアそのものなのである。僕自身の体験を書こう。2006年10月、
『ＴＶブロス』のカンヌ映画祭についての記事の中で、ライターが露骨な差別表現を使ったという事件があった。ライターもライターだが、通してしまった編集者も不注意である。要するに差別問題に関する知識も関心も自覚もまるでなかったわけで、問題になるのは当たり前だ。ところがその一件で、大手出版社がいっせいに過剰反応した。それまでＯＫだった、どうということはない表現にまで、過敏にチェックが入るようになったのだ。そのとばっちりが僕にも来た。ちょうど『神は沈黙せず』の文庫版のゲラチェックをやっていたのだが、いったん戻したゲラに、校閲者による膨大な数のチェックが入って戻ってきたのである。どれも単行本ではまったく問題にならなかった箇所だ。修正しろという命令ではないが、あらためて表現に一考をお願いする……というのである。どんな表現にチェックが入ったか、実例を挙げよう。>ネットに流れた情報だけを盲信した人々が>精神病院に入院させられているとか>地球が狂いはじめているのではないだろうか>狂信的な熱情にかられて行動した>たちまち悪臭漂うスラムと化した>自分の中にも狂気がひそんでいる可能性>強いボスに盲従する猿たち>いみじくもドーキンスが言ったように、「盲目の時計職人（ブラインド・ウォッチメイカー）」なのだ。>兄は狂っているのだろうか。>よく発狂しなかったものだと>悲しみのあまり狂乱したことも>怒り狂った群集によって>頭のおかしい人間が行なった未熟な犯行にすぎず>ポルターガイストの荒れ狂う施設
！>熱狂的な加古沢ファン>精神錯乱が多発した>ファンの狂騒に踊らされることは決してなかった>狂気と正気の境界線をどこに置くか>狂気に蝕まれている自分に言い聞かせたこれでもチェック箇所のごく一部にすぎない。
つまり「狂 」 「盲」という字すべてにチェックが入っているのだ。たまらん。だいたい『ブラインド・ウォッチメイカー』を他にどう訳せと？ つーか、「ブラインド」はＯＫ で「盲目」はダメという根拠は何だ？いちばん笑ったのは、>私はぽかんと口を開けた。盲点だった。「盲点」にもチェックが!?（笑）そりゃ盲点だったわ。いやもうこれは床にひっくり返って笑ったよ。 のちに「七パーセントのテンムー」を書いた時に、ギャグのネタにさせていただいた。>馬丁の娘>老婆の横顔という部分にもチェックが入った。「馬丁」も差別語とは知らなかった。つーか、これをどう言い換えろというのだ？なぜ「老婆」が差別語認定されているのか、編集さんも首をひねっていた。おそらく、かつて「婆あ」という侮蔑的表現が問題になったことがあって、そこから拡大解釈して「婆」という漢字すべてを自粛することになったのではないかと想像するが、今となっては真相は分からない。>電波系>サイコキラーという単語にもチェックが入った。「サイコ」という言葉がまずいらしいのだ。冗談じゃない！
ヒッチコックの映画はどうなるんだ!?
だいたい、「サイコキラー」なんて言葉、日常的に使ってるだろ。>かなり節操のない日本的キリスト教徒だったようだという部分にもチェック。「『日本のキリスト教徒は節操がない』と誤読されるおそれがあるのでは？」というのである。いねーよ、そんなひねくれた誤読する奴。お前だけだよ。>日本各地の福祉施設に収容された何千人もの子供たちという部分にもチェックが入った。「収容」という言葉がいかんので「預けられた」に改めろと指示された。なぜ？
分からん。さらに笑えたのが、アメリカ国内でイスラム原理主義者やキリスト教右翼によるテロが起きるというくだり。校正者の意見によれば、「フィクションですが、偏見を助長するおそれがあるのでは？」アホかああああーっ！実在の集団による犯罪行為をフィクションの中で描いてはいかんというのなら、スパイ小説もポリティカル・フィクションも書けんようになるわーい！出版業界で生きる人間が、自分の首絞めてバラバラにして埋葬するようなことを言い出すんじゃねえええーっ！こんな箇所にもチェックが入った。だからさ、主人公は差別意識に対する激しい怒りを表明してるんだよ？
あんたちゃんと文章の意味、理解してる？25章のこんなくだりにもチェックが、どこがまずいと思います？なんと、「黒人」という単語すべてにチェックが入ってるのである！ ええー、「黒人 」 もＮＧ用語!?
んなアホな！『神は沈黙せず』をお読みになった方ならお分かりのように、この小説には僕自身の、身障者差別・人種差別・民族差別に対する強い嫌悪が随所に反映されている。差別問題を扱うのだから当然、差別的発言をする人物も出てくるわけだが、それにすべてチェックが入った。「朝鮮の手先」「あつらは犯罪者ばっかりだ」とかである。だからさ、この小説は差別を糾弾してる内容なのに、何でびくびして自粛しなきゃならんわけ？
おかしいじゃん！最初は笑ってたが、だんだん腹が立ってきた。この校閲者、自分では何も考えてない。機械的に「狂 」
「盲」という字を検索して鉛筆でチェックを入れているだけである。ある表現が差別に当たるかどうか自分で判断することを放棄し、著者に全責任を押しつけている。それはつまり、「私は差別問題なんか分かりませーん」「責任とりたくありませーん」と宣言しているようなもんではないか。そういう意識こそ差別なんだと、どうして気づかん!?でもって、これまで小説の中で何度も差別問題を描いてきた僕が、何で今さら糾弾を恐れなくちゃなんないんですかい!?こわくないよ、そんなの。万が一、人権団体に糾弾されたって、これまで自分が書いてきたものをずらっと並べて、「あなたの方こそ不勉強です。これを読んでください。僕はこういう作家です」と、逆に教育してやるよ。こうした「違反語狩り」が本当に差別をなくす目的ならいいことだろう。だが、現実は正反対だ。違反語リストを作って自主規制をしている人たちは、単純に言葉の言い替えで済ませているだけで、差別問題の本質など考えようとはしない。それどころか、障害者の抱える問題をリアルに描く作品や、差別を批判する内容の作品すら規制しようとする。違反語狩りは差別問題への真摯な取り組みなどではなく、正反対である。現実に存在する問題から目をそむけ、口をつぐむことで、被差別者についての正しい理解が広まるのを妨げ、間接的に差別を助長しているのだ。『別冊 図書館戦争Ｉ』には木島ジンという作家が登場する。彼は反社会的、暴力的な作品ばかりを書いているが、婉曲表現ばかりで違反語をひとつも使っていないため、メディア良化法では取り締まることができない。彼は良化法に対する批判として、意図的にそうした小説を書き、社会に挑戦しているのである。木島ジンというのは嫌な奴だと思う。しかし、言っていることは正論だ。違反語さえ使われていなければいいという問題ではない。それは『レインツリーの国』を読めばよく分かる。『レインツリーの国』と木島ジンの作品は正反対だが、同じことを訴えている。前者は違反語を使ってはいる差別的ではなく、後者は違反語を使っていないが差別的である。ある表現が差別的かどうかは文脈から判断するしかない。単語だけ取り出しても意味がない。こんな単純なことを理解できない――いや、理解しようとしない人間が大勢いる。繰り返す。『図書館戦争』はリアルな話である。銃撃戦こそないものの、僕らはすでに『図書館戦争』の世界で生きているのだ。

The New York Yankees swooped in Tuesday and hooked prized free agent Mark Teixeira , reaching agreement with the first baseman on an eight - year contract worth $ 180 million , three sources involved in the negotiations said .
The agreement , which is subject to a physical , includes a signing bonus of about $ 5 million paid out over the first three years of the contract , no opt - out clause and a complete no - trade provision , the sources said .
With the Red Sox , Angels , Nationals and Orioles making well - documented runs at signing Teixeira , the Yankees made an offer weeks ago , but then withdrew it ; their intention all along was to make an offer , which they did formally on Tuesday , if it fell within parameters acceptable to the organization .
The contract will pay Teixeira , who made it clear he wanted to make a decision on where to play next season and beyond by Christmas , an average of $ 22.5 million per season .
Boston 's offer to Teixeira was for $ 168 million over eight years , an average of $ 21 million a year .
" They have the revenue sources that most do n't have , and they have a lot of money coming off the books this season , " Angels general manager Tony Reagins , who had hoped to retain Teixeira , told The Associated Press on Tuesday night .
" So if they 're willing and able to spend , I 'm pretty sure they 've made some good investments . "
The Yankees indeed shed $ 88.5 million from their books ( included in that total -- $ 23.4 million on Jason Giambi , $ 16 million on Bobby Abreu , and $ 11 million to both Mike Mussina and Carl Pavano ) , and even with the Teixeira contract , they expect their payroll to fall below $ 200 million .
New York has committed $ 423.5 million in salary in the past month , with $ 161 million going to left - handed pitcher CC Sabathia ( $ 23 million per over seven years ) and $ 82.5 million to right - hander A.J. Burnett ( $ 18.5 million per over five ) last week alone .
It 's not about reducing abortion .
The advocates for a new common ground correctly note the correlation between poverty and abortion rates .
But they fail to mention how poverty first contributes to unintended pregnancies .
There comes a moment in justice movements when society edges forward
just enough that once - heated controversies – suffrage , racial
integration , interracial marriage – become part of the cultural fabric .
Sexism and racism may continue to simmer , but the overall movement can
declare victory and move on .
On Election Day , the reproductive justice movement may have achieved
its moment .
The election of a pro-choice President - elect puts Roe v. Wade
back on firm ground .
Ballot measures that would have restricted
reproductive health rights in three states were all soundly defeated .
The Mexico City Policy , which blocks U.S. aid to international family
planning organization that counsel women on abortion , is expected to be quickly reversed .
A post-election survey by Faith in Public Life showed that a clear majority of Americans want to keep abortion legal .
The fiercest opponents of women ’s reproductive rights are not giving
up .
But over the past few weeks , we have heard a commitment from
several Catholic and evangelical Protestant leaders to finding a new
common ground on abortion .
David Gushee , writing for the Associated Baptist Press ,
notes that , " Over 80 percent of white evangelicals and Catholics
believe elected officials should work together to find ways to reduce
abortions by helping prevent unwanted pregnancies , expanding adoption
and increasing economic support for women who want to carry their
pregnancies to term . "
I welcome the support and collaboration of Professor Gushee , as well
as Rev. Jim Wallis of Sojourners , Catholic legal scholar Douglas Kmiec ,
Richard Cizik of the National Association of Evangelicals and others ,
who are calling to " reduce the number of abortions . "
But I am puzzled that their goal is to reduce abortions rather than the
unintended pregnancies that force women and families to consider
abortion in the first place .

The call to reduce unintended pregnancies is the right one .
What we
must focus on now are the means to do so – specifically , comprehensive
sexuality education ( not abstinence - only ) and universal access to
contraceptive services , including emergency contraception .
The advocates for a new common ground correctly note the correlation
between poverty and abortion rates .
But they fail to mention how
poverty first contributes to unintended pregnancies .
Adoption
alternatives and economic support for poor pregnant women are important
– but these strategies do not address the fact that poor women are at
least five times more likely than other women to become pregnant
unintentionally .
Here ’s what the Guttmacher Institute ’s Susan Cohen
wrote the last time an abortion reduction strategy was floated by
Democrats for Life in 2006 : " While it is theoretically possible that
increased social supports for pregnant women and even more
‘ adoption - positive ’ problem - pregnancy counseling could have some
impact , neither can hope to approach the real reductions in the
abortion rate that could be achieved by preventing unintended pregnancy in the first place . "
( Emphasis added . )
This is the real moral challenge we face .
I ’ve worked with thousands
of women facing unintended pregnancies .
They are n’t looking for
" abortion on demand " ; with only a handful of exceptions , these women
sat with me ( often with their partners or parents beside them ) , and
they wept as they tried to decide what was best to do .
Often they did
have financial concerns – not so much about how they would pay for
prenatal care or infant care , but about how they could afford to raise
a child ( or in many cases , another child ) to adulthood .
Too
often , they did not have partners who they wanted to spend their lives
with or who could support them .
As one of my colleagues has said , such
women have " too much responsibility already and too few resources , both
personal and economic . "
So here is my suggestion for common ground .
Let ’s stop talking
about reducing the number of abortions as a goal in itself .
Such talk
obscures what should be the principal objective – reducing unintended
pregnancies – and leads to counterproductive strategies that would
place restrictions on abortion access .
It also misrepresents the platform that President - elect Obama ran on ,
which affirmed a woman ’s right to choose and opposed " any and all
efforts to weaken or undermine that right . "
The Democratic platform
called for " access to comprehensive affordable family planning services
and age - appropriate sex education which empower people to make informed
choices and live healthy lives , " as well as economic support for
pregnant women .
Let ’s start talking about reducing unintended pregnancies .
This is not only the better public health position , it is a faithful
and moral one as well .
Five years ago , the Religious Institute
published an Open Letter to Religious Leaders on Abortion as a Moral Decision ,
which includes this eloquent and irrefutable statement : " The sanctity
of human life is best upheld when we assure that it is not created
carelessly . "
Surely this is the common ground where all of us – the new
Administration , the new Congress , even my Catholic and evangelical
colleagues – can proudly stand .

Sugar - Coated Fedora LiveCD Gives A Taste of the OLPC XO
by Ostatic Staff - Nov. 06 , 2008
Last Thursday , the OLPC Special Interest Group ( SIG ) announced the availability of the Fedora Sugar Spin LiveCD .
This release incorporates the Sugar Desktop Environment in to a Fedora liveCD .
It 's an easy way to try out the Sugar environment and associated applications without touching your existing system .
The OLPC SIG plans to bring more Sugar application adaptations to Fedora eventually , through the traditional YUM installation procedure .
At this point , the Fedora Sugar team has a base set of packages available for Fedora 10 ( in rawhide ) and reports that the ' yum groupinstall sugar - desktop ' should successfully install the desktop environment to traditional desktop installations .
The live disk image incorporates Sugar - Browse ( based on XULRunner ) and Sugar - Write ( based on AbiWord ) as well as support for chat and several other applications .
It 's interesting to watch Sugar spread from the OLPC XO laptop and appear in several major distributions .
Aside from encouraging wider development , it opens up a very targeted environment and platform to an audience of users who might never consider an OLPC machine .
Chronic Fatigue May Have a Viral Link
New research links chronic fatigue syndrome to a virus that lives in the gut .
Sept. 13 , 2007  --
Feeling tired ?
There 's a chance that lethargic feeling may have less to do with a hectic schedule and more to do with a stomach virus .
In a study published Wednesday in the Journal of Clinical Pathology , researchers in California suggest that chronic fatigue syndrome may be linked to the presence of enteroviruses -- viral microorganisms that reside in the digestive tract .
More than 1 million people are believed to suffer from CFS , a debilitating disease without any known cause or cure .
The condition is associated with persistent fatigue that severely limits day - to - day activities .
And many patients with CFS also complain of stomach pain and indigestion -- a correlation that led study author Dr. John Chia and co-investigator Andrew Chia of Enterovirus Medical Research to investigate further .
What they discovered by analyzing samples of stomach tissue from 165 patients with CFS was that 82 percent of these individuals had high levels of enteroviruses in their digestive systems .
" I believe that chronic antiviral infections are an important cause of CFS , " said lead author Chia .
" This finding will open the door to research on how the viruses work in the body and how antiviral drugs can be developed to treat these symptoms . "
Other experts in the field shared Chia 's optimism .
Dr. Nancy Klimas , a professor of medicine at the University of Miami School of Medicine said the research may have revealed a link that nobody expected .
" It 's a very powerful study , and one that is hard to dismiss because he looked at so many patients , " she said .
" I think he is on to something very important here . "
Tiny Virus , Major Fatigue
In recent years , microorganisms in the gut have been fingered as culprits in other maladies -- the most notable example being the link established between the stomach bacteria Helicobacter pylori and stomach ulcers , which netted Australian scientists Barry Marshall and Robin Warren a Nobel Prize in 2005 .
The stomach virus , Chia believes , that is linked to CFS enters the body through the gastrointestinal tract and then moves on to infect other tissues , such as the central nervous system and the heart .
It begins as an acute infection , causing flulike symptoms and stomachaches .
But then it lingers -- and in some people , it develops into a chronic infection that causes CFS .
Unlike traditional viruses that infect and kill cells , the enterovirus " has adapted to grow inside of a cell but does not kill it , " said Chia .
The cell protects the virus and allows it to thrive .
So although the body 's immune system tries to fight off the virus , it does not succeed .
But the immune system does not give up .
Rather , it continues to try to fight the virus -- a process that stresses the body , causing fatigue and stomach pain .
This most recent study is not the first one to identify a virus as the possible cause of CFS .
When research on CFS began about 20 years ago , scientists believed viruses to be the culprit .
At this time , unfortunately , researchers were either looking at the wrong types of viruses or did n't have the technology to find the right ones .
" When scientists could n't prove that CFS was linked to viruses , they moved on , " said Klimas .
" In the next seven to eight years , research was heavily focused on hormones and the autonomic nervous system .
However , with the human genome project and all the advances in genetics , there are now new tools available to look for viruses . "
One reason that the virus Chia has implicated in CFS may have been so hard to pin down is the fact that it does not appear in the blood .
In light of this , Chia looked for the viral proteins in the stomach tissue itself .
" We looked for the viral proteins in stomach cells of patients with CFS and of patients without CFS , who served as controls , " Chia said .
" We found tons of patients with CFS who had the viral proteins . "
And although about 20 percent of the control patients also tested positive for the virus , they had only a small amount of it in their tissue .
In contrast , the stomach cells of patients with CFS were swarming with it .
Hope for CFS Sufferers
Many researchers believe that enteroviruses are not the only cause of CFS .
" There are over 15 different pathogens contributing to CFS , " said Kristin Loomis , president and executive director of the HHV - 6 Foundation , which funds viral research .
" Enteroviruses are one , HHV - 6 is another , and Epstein - Barr virus is a third . "
With so many different viruses , it may seem impossible to tackle the disease .
However , certain antiviral drugs have already been developed that target specific viruses and can be used to treat certain groups of CFS patients .
In one example , doctors at Stanford University School of Medicine are using the antiviral drug valganciclovir to treat CFS -- with promising results so far .
And Chia believes that as long as other scientists in the field confirm his results , drugs to fight enteroviruses will be available within five years .
" However , " Klimas warned , " there are not antiviral drugs to cover all viruses . …
I think we should look at treatments that make the immune system stronger and less susceptible to viral infection . "
There is hope for CFS patients , Chia believes , even if it comes 20 years too late .
" I think it 's a good year for CFS , " he said .
" Federal agencies have recognized the severity of the disease .
It has been brought to the public 's attention by the media , and now it's the drug companies ' turn to start developing antiviral medications . "

Last night , 12 homes across 400 acres of a Tennessee town were damaged after coal ash erupted out of a nearby storage pond .
Today , thirty - nine environmental groups have petitioned Barack Obama to reject Bush ’s new rule that will allow coal ash from power plants to be more easily dumped in abandoned mines , despite the known risks of water pollution .
[ social_buttons ]
Coal ash , a byproduct of burning coal for electricity , is known to contain such toxins as mercury and arsenic , and is actually 100 times more radioactive than nuclear waste .
While storing the waste in old mines does help prevent disasters like the one in Tennessee , the toxins still seep into the groundwater while sitting in the mine .
“ Disposal of coal ash in mines is a growing practice that threatens the health and environment of coalfield communities , ” said Lisa Graves Marcucci , president of Jefferson Action Group , based in Pennsylvania .
While the flood in Tennessee is actually much smaller than coal ash pond disasters in the past , it is still an unpleasant reminder that there really is no such thing as clean coal .
The ash will always be a problem , even if the CO2 is somehow sequestered underground .
UPDATE : Greenpeace is now calling for a criminal investigation into the spill .
Similar accidents have resulted in felony charges in the past .
“ Every facility like this is supposed to have a spill contingency plan to prevent this kind of disaster , ” said Rick Hind , Greenpeace Legislative Director .
“ The authorities need to get to the bottom of what went wrong and hold the responsible parties accountable . ”

More evidence has emerged of appalling conflicts of interest that throw into doubt the advice rendered and the research performed by two prominent psychiatrists who have received substantial funding from the pharmaceutical industry .
The revelations prove , once again , the need for universities and professional societies to crack down on conflicts of interest , and for Congress to pass legislation that will bring hidden conflicts into the open .
Earlier this year , Congressional investigators discovered that Dr. Joseph Biederman , a world - renowned child psychiatrist at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital , had failed to report to Harvard at least $ 1.4 million in income from drug companies , in violation of the university ’s conflict - of - interest guidelines .
Now , internal drug company e-mail and documents that surfaced in a lawsuit have sketched out what looks like an unsavory collaboration between Dr. Biederman and Johnson & Johnson to generate and disseminate data that would support use of an antipsychotic drug , Risperdal , in children , a controversial target group .
The various documents indicate that Dr. Biederman repeatedly asked a Johnson & Johnson subsidiary to fund a research center at Massachusetts General to focus on children and adolescents with bipolar disorders and that the company provided almost $ 1 million .
Disturbingly , one of the center ’s publicly stated missions , along with improving the psychiatric care of children , was to “ move forward the commercial goals of J.& J . ”
Corey Hill — the lanky and likable contestant from season five of The Ultimate Fighter ( TUF ) — sustained a catastrophic leg injury during his fight against Dale Hartt at UFC Fight Night 16 : " Fight for the Troops " last night at the Crown Coliseum in Fayetteville , North Carolina .
Hartt apparently checked a leg kick from Hill early in the second round , which snapped the 6 ' 4 " Miletich - trained fighter 's shin .
It is a terribly graphic and unfortunate injury that will more than likely keep him sidelined for a very long time .
We wish him a speedy and full recovery .
Hill stopped Joe Veres via technical knockout in his Octagon debut at UFC Fight Night 12 back in January .
He dropped his next fight against Justin Buchholz at UFC 86 on July 5 .
We 'll provide and update on Hill 's health as soon as possible .

MySpace , the online social network owned by News Corp sees opportunities to buy start - ups for a fraction of what they would have cost six months ago as the economic slump slices millions of dollars off their price tags .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
MySpace co-founder and Chief Executive Chris DeWolfe said companies worth between $ 200 million and $ 300 million just six months ago are now running out of money and willing to sell themselves for less than one - tenth of that value .
Many Web 2.0 start - ups - so - called because they develop interactive websites and applications - have begun knocking on his door recently , looking to sell themselves , DeWolfe told the Reuters Media Summit via video conference .
" At the lower levels the money dries up , everyone 's looking for some kind of exit and the valuations we 're seeing out there are definitely a small , small fraction of what they were even five or six months ago , " he said , adding that he expects these companies to become even cheaper in the next few months .
DeWolfe said acquisitions are central to MySpace 's growth strategy , which includes expanding its presence in international markets , building its music offering and developing applications for mobile phones .
MySpace , which media mogul Rupert Murdoch bought for $ 580 million in 2005 , looks at start - ups in each of these areas when deciding to buy , build or partner with another company .
" Certainly we 're interested in expanding in key markets internationally and there may be some opportunities on the music side at some point , but right now we do n't have any particular companies directly in our sights , " the MySpace CEO said .
DeWolfe said MySpace also was not interested in Twitter , the micro-blogging site which gained mainstream popularity after President - elect Barack Obama 's campaign used it to communicate with supporters .
" We 're not actively interested in Twitter , " DeWolfe said in response to a question about whether MySpace wanted to buy it .
MySpace 's rival Facebook earlier held talks to buy Twitter , according to media reports .
Twitter is a " great service " but MySpace provides a similar service and would rather focus on acquisitions related to its core growth areas , he added .

Many start - ups in Silicon Valley , the stretch of land in northern California that is home to top internet and technology companies like Google , are struggling to stay afloat as the economy teeters on the edge of recession .
Top venture capital firms have warned start - ups to be cautious with their use of cash and to cut excess fat to survive the downturn .
Venture capitalists fund start - ups in hopes of making several times their investment once these companies go public or are sold to a bigger competitor .
Venture capital investment in start - ups fell 7 per cent in the third quarter compared to the second quarter .
The National Venture Capital Association expects investment to dip further in coming quarters as pension funds and institutional investors distribute fewer dollars among venture capital firms .
The web is changing .
Historically it ’s been painfully easy to request resources from remote locations ( such as stylesheets , scripts , images , and loading pages in iframes ) – but this has brought along a whole world of security issues that browsers are continuing to try and resolve .
This openness has come to define what web development is all about : Dead simple sharing of resources and ability to get started .
It ’s very likely that the lack of restrictions placed on these historical page elements will continue to plague browser developers for many years to come .
That does n’t mean that browsers have to make the same “ mistakes ” going forward .
This is where the new W3C Access Control specification comes into play .
All the new cross - domain - capable technologies that are coming to browsers will be requiring the use of Access Controls from the get - go , including :
The Access Control specification has been one of the most - rapidly - changing specifications that I ’ve seen .
I wrote a demo early this year and have had to update it at least twice since then in order to match the updated APIs – and it appears as if they may have even changed again .
Right now the specification requires that any resource that you wish to make accessible in a cross - domain manner must include an extra header specifying which site (s ) are allowed to access it .
If you wish to allow any site to access your resource you would use :
Access - Control - Allow - Origin : *
and if you only wanted one other domain to access it you would use :
Access - Control - Allow - Origin : https://johnresig.com
This is important :
It now means that site owners must make a conscious decision to enable cross -domain access of their resources ( in contrast to images , stylesheets , and scripts which are always made available cross - domain with no way to disable it ) .
( There are a number of other headers specified by the Access Control specification , for more fine - grained access . )
There is going to be a lot of confusion and anger regarding this large , fundamental , change to the style of these upcoming APIs :
They are n’t like the web that we know and love !
The best write - up that I ’ve seen , to date , was by Jonas Sicking of Mozilla on the Ogg Mailing lists .
This one section , in particular , is particularly poignant :
Why not use the same policy as for < img >?
Yes , we could definitely do the same for < video > as we have for < img > .
But it will come with the same downsides .
It will mean that we will have to be much more cautious with how we develop the API for .
There are already discussions about API features that we could not allow if we allowed cross -site video without Access - Control ( or similar ) protection .
We would not be allowed to have callbacks for captions where the captions are handed to page javascript to be displayed in the page .
This would allow an internet site to get captions from board presentation videos hosted on intranet sites , something that is obviously not acceptable .
We could say that the captions callback would work , but only if the video was loaded from same site , or if had the Access - Control - Allow - Origin : * header set .
However this will likely result in random bugs like captions sometimes failing since the developer had perfect hearing and so did n’t do a lot of testing with captions .
In general accessibility is hard enough to get people to do correct that I ’m reluctant to add features that work great as long as you do n’t take accessibility into account , but where you have to take extra steps to get accessibility to work .
Similar arguments goes for accessing the size of the video file ( for example through progress events ) .
We can not allow that to work for cross - site loads unless the site has opted in .
This is because we likely wo n’t know that it ’s actually a video that is being downloaded until after the first progress events have been fired .
This means that you could use < video > to measure file sizes for arbitrary files that are otherwise protected by firewalls and / or logins .
If we always restrict usage of < video > to the cases when we know that the video is private data we will be much more free to develop APIs and functionality since we wo n’t have to worry about protecting the data inside it , or deal with error conditions when someone tries to use sensitive APIs from a cross - site loaded video that did n’t have Access - Control - Allow - Origin : *.
I recommend that you take the time to read his whole piece as it ’s worth it to gain a full understanding of the problems at play here ( especially related to the < video /> tag ) .
One thing is clear : Security is being addressed center - stage in the new web APIs .
This is going to be good as it ’ll prevent horrible security bugs going forward while , at the same time , change the landscape of web development in a very fundamental way .
The web had its fun but now reality is starting to set in – it ’s time to get to work .
Hamas officials stepped in yesterday to offer cash handouts worth a total of $ 52 m ( £ 38.1 m ) to Gazans who had lost family members , homes or businesses , as fresh evidence emerged of Israel 's destruction of civilian infrastructure in Gaza , including the territory 's largest concrete factory and the only operating flour mill - both of which are now in ruins .
As well as the heavy toll on human life , more than 21,000 buildings and apartments have been wholly or partly destroyed , including at least 219 major factories , among them several industrial sites , including food processing plants .
Palestinian surveyors said an initial estimate shows overall damage of $ 1.9bn .
Israel 's leaders insisted its war was against Hamas and its structures in Gaza .
But much of Gaza 's private industry had already been forced out of business by Israel 's economic blockade over the past year and a half .
The rest has now been severely damaged by war .
" They are destroying the infrastructure of the economy , " said Amr Hamad , head of the Palestinian Federation of Industries .
" They want us to be dependent on their economy . "
The damage severely limits any hope of swift reconstruction and drives Gaza closer to complete aid dependency .
Israeli prime minister Ehud Olmert yesterday said the Israel Defence Forces had done " everything in order to avoid hitting civilians . "
" I do not know of any military that is more moral , fair and sensitive to civilians ' lives than the IDF , " he said .
One of the most striking targets was the al - Badr flour mill in Sudaniya , in northern Gaza , built in the 1920s and the largest mill in the strip .
After Israel halted imports of wheat flour into Gaza in early November , al - Badr became the last operating mill in the territory because it had a large store of wheat .
Before dawn on January 10 the mill 's main production lines , spread over five floors , were destroyed by an Israeli air strike - half the bomb casing remains on the first floor - and by several shells , apparently fired from tanks and Apache helicopters .
Rashad Hammada , 55 , co-owns the factory with his brother .
Hammada said he believed there were no Palestinian fighters in the compound .
He estimated his losses were at least $ 3 m and that , even if new machinery could be imported , it would take six months to a year to build a new production line .
Palestinian merchants are now forced to import refined wheat flour from Israel at 50 % higher cost .
" I 'm really surprised with the Israelis .
They encouraged us to build , and then they destroyed it , " said Hammada .
A few miles away at the Abu Eida concrete factory , east of Jabaliya , the scene was even more desolate .
All four of the company 's factories for ready - mix concrete and breeze blocks were reduced to rubble .
The factory - the largest concrete plant in Gaza - was a partner in an important northern Gaza sewage project supported by Tony Blair , the Middle East envoy .
Now the owner , Taysir Abu Eida , is facing losses of at least $ 10 m , which include his three - storey house nearby in Jabal Rayas that was destroyed with six neighbouring houses , where many of his relatives once lived .
Although the leading factories had insurance , there is no cover for war damage .
" Such widespread destruction of civilian economic infrastructure is surely a strike at the heart of attempts to bring peace , " said Chris Gunness , spokesman for the UN agency for Palestinian refugees .
Mitchell initiative
Following promises of a push for peace in the Middle East , Barack Obama 's envoy to the region , George Mitchell , is due to arrive in Israel on Wednesday .
Diplomats said Mitchell plans to meet leaders in Saudi Arabia , Egypt , Israel , the West Bank and Jordan , but they ruled out direct contact with Hamas .
The trip is expected to last roughly a week .
International envoy Tony Blair welcomed Mitchell 's appointment yesterday : " I see this as a partnership between America on the one side and the international community on the other ... to make sure that we get the help to people in Gaza , then that we set about revitalising the process ... leading to ( Palestinian ) statehood . "
Esteban Armando Nunez , the 19 - year - old son of former Assembly Speaker Fabian Nunez , was arrested in Sacramento County on Tuesday in connection with the stabbing death of a 22 - year - old college student in San Diego , police said .
San Diego Homicide Capt .
Jim Collins said Nunez was arrested along with three other men , all also 19 .
All four will be taken back to San Diego , where they will be jailed .
Each faces one count of murder and three counts of assault with a deadly weapon .
Collins said Luis Santos was stabbed to death at a party near San Diego State on Oct. 4 , during a brawl with other partygoers .
Reached by phone Tuesday night , Fabian Nunez declined to comment and referred calls to C. Bradley Patton , a criminal defense lawyer in Carlsbad .
Patton did not immediately return a message left at his office .

Arrested in addition to Esteban Nunez were Ryan Jett , Rafael Garcia and Leshanor Thomas .
The victim was a student at Mesa College .
Three other partygoers were wounded in the fight .
Fabian Nunez served six years in the Assembly , including four as speaker .
Term limits forced him to leave office this year .

This spooky black bean hummus , complete with edible spider web and spider , will be the healthiest thing on your vegan Halloween menu .
I have two standard Halloween recipes in my , ahhem , repertoire .
One of them involves baking the equivalent of a 4 - layer chocolate cake in the shape of a pumpkin ; it contains a gazillion calories and takes most of an afternoon to make .
As you can probably guess , I do n’t make that one very often .
When I need a Halloween - themed food for a party , I ’m much more likely to whip up this black bean hummus dip , which takes about 10 minutes and , if you scoop it up with carrot sticks or rice crackers , is one of the lighter dishes you ’ll find at most parties .
I vary the ingredients every time I make it .
Sometimes I treat it as a regular hummus , with lemon juice and a pinch of paprika ; other times it ’s more of a Southwestern bean dip , with chili powder and even tomatoes .
I took the middle road this time and used lime juice instead of lemon and chipotle pepper instead of paprika .
Unfortunately , I went a little overboard and added too much chipotle , resulting in a dip that was overly smoky and too spicy to serve to unsuspecting party - goers .
To balance out the heat and smokiness I started adding soy yogurt by the tablespoon .
As it turns out , I like the creaminess the yogurt imparts , so I ’m leaving it in the recipe .
My advice is to add the chipotle a little at a time ; if you add too much , its smoky flavor borders on bitter .

Chinese manufacturers who export have suffered in the credit crunch
Tens of thousands of migrant workers are leaving the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou after losing their jobs , railway officials say .
The increase to 130,000 passengers leaving the city 's main station daily is being blamed on the credit crunch .
Guangzhou is one of China 's largest manufacturing hubs , but many companies who export products have collapsed .
Chinese officials are worried that a sudden increase in unemployment could lead to social unrest .
The most badly hit export companies are toy , shoe , and furniture manufacturers .
There are already reports of demonstrations and social unrest in the provinces of Zhejiang and Guangdong .
An upsurge of labour disputes caused by bankruptcies and layoffs this week forced the boom - town of Shenzhen to issue an urgent notice calling for government departments and enterprises to work together to reduce tension .
BBC China analyst Shirong
Chen says there would be a ripple effect in many inner regions of China too - the earthquake - hit Sichuan Province has 1.3 m working in Shenzhen .
For the Chongqing municipality , three million migrant workers used to send home millions of US dollars ' worth of local currency every year , but this source of funding is dwindling to a trickle .
DETROIT 
With a lifeline from the White House , General Motors and Chrysler will survive for the next few months while they revamp .
But will they thrive again ?
The plans from the car companies offer little in terms of fresh ideas .
Instead , they are focused more on slow - selling models , persuading G.M. ’s debt holders to accept stock and getting union wages more in line with those paid by foreign brands in the United States .
Such moves are certainly necessary in the short term , but no company can keep cutting its way to prosperity .
Even President - elect Barack Obama said Friday that Detroit automakers should not “ squander the chance ” to change their management practices .
To be sure , it takes years and enormous investments to develop new vehicles , and much of Detroit ’s focus throughout this decade has been on shedding workers and closing plants in response to its shrinking market share .
ANALYSIS :ISRAELI DEFENCE minister Ehud Barak told the Knesset yesterday that Israel was engaged in " an all - out war " with Hamas " to the bitter end " .
Mr Barak added that the massive air assault Israel launched on Saturday is aimed not at Gaza 's residents , but at the coastal strip 's Hamas rulers .
He said the operation 's goal is to force Hamas to stop its hostile actions directed at Israeli civilians .
The defence minister said that Israel withdrew from the Gaza Strip three years ago to give a chance for a new reality on the ground , but that Hamas had used the territory as a terrorist base .
" Hamas is responsible for everything that happens in Gaza , " he said .
" This operation will be widened , deepened as we see fit . "
Mr Barak told the Knesset that the defence establishment spent months preparing for the Gaza operation .
Israeli leaders believe there is a window of opportunity to engage Hamas before world leaders begin to exert pressure to reach a settlement .
Israel struck in the period between Christmas and New Year when most western leaders were otherwise occupied .
The campaign also coincides with the changeover period of US administrations .
Both the outgoing and incoming US presidents are likely to believe that Washington 's peacemaking efforts in the region will be boosted if Israel manages to inflict a significant military defeat on Hamas .
Barack Obama , speaking earlier this year , after visiting Sderot , the Israeli border town which bore the brunt of militant rocket attacks , said : " If somebody was sending rockets into my house where my two daughters sleep at night , I would do everything to stop that , and would expect Israel to do the same thing . "
The Israeli leadership sees the war as only the latest round in the struggle of the Jewish state against the radical jihadist axis led by Iran and Syria , and their proxies , Hizbullah and Hamas .
And , Israel believes , the moderate Arab states also have a stake in a decisive Israeli victory , although their leaders may be reluctant to say so publicly .
Israeli analysts pointed to the unprecedented call by Hizbullah leader Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah , on Sunday for an uprising in Egypt , accusing Cairo of being a partner to " Israeli war crimes " .
Israeli leaders continue to be vague about the aims of the current campaign .
Despite previous comments in favour of toppling Hamas , no one has cited regime change as the ultimate aim of the war .
Hamas seized control of Gaza in the summer of 2007 , after a week of clashes with secular Fatah forces loyal to president Mahmoud Abbas .
In the previous year Hamas candidates had trounced their Fatah rivals in parliamentary elections in Gaza .
The Hamas coup in Gaza effectively created two separate Palestinian entities ; Hamastan in Gaza , and Fatahland in the West Bank .
Even in the unlikely event of Gaza residents turning against Hamas because of the Israeli assault , there is currently no viable alternative .
Mr Abbas and senior Fatah officials have expressed their desire to resume control of Gaza , but to do so following the current conflict would taint them as collaborators .
Ramadan Shallah , secretary general of the Islamic Jihad , warned that any Palestinian " who dares to return to the Gaza Strip aboard an Israeli tank would be condemned as a traitor " .
Paradoxically , the Israeli operation may not only end with Hamas still firmly entrenched in Gaza , but it may see their popularity increase in the West Bank , where security forces loyal to Mr Abbas have slowly been spreading their authority over the last year .

Three weeks after the death of top prospect Alexei Cherepanov , the New York Rangers are seeking a compensatory pick in the second round of the 2009 NHL draft , saying " with all due respect to Alexei 's family and his memory , he is technically eligible to be drafted again next year , " the New York Post has reported .
The team is citing Article 8.3 ( b ) in the NHL 's collective bargaining agreement , which mandates compensatory selections be provided when teams are unable to sign first - round draft picks .
Alexei Cherepanov , the top - ranked European player in the 2007 draft , was the Rangers ' first - round pick that year .
Gregory Shamus / Getty Images
" The question is with the one parenthetical phrase in Article 8.3 ( b ) that refers compensation for an unsigned first - round draft pick who is ' again eligible for the Entry Draft or becomes an Unrestricted Free Agent , ' " Rangers assistant general manager Cam Hope told the newspaper .
" That language was inserted to clarify that a team would be owed a compensatory pick even if they were to re-draft that player or sign him as a free agent .
" It seems now as if that phrase is unintentionally precluding the deceased from being included as eligible for compensation .
We understand that this is a sensitive issue , but with all due respect to Alexei 's family and his memory , he is technically eligible to be drafted again next year . "
Cherepanov was the 17th selection in the 2007 draft .
He died Oct. 13 after collapsing during a game in Russia while playing in a Continental Hockey League game with the Omsk club Avangard .
He was 19 years old .
" We are not attempting to capitalize on a tragedy , but there would be no question regarding the Rangers ' right to a compensatory pick if Cherepanov had been revived and survived the incident and were on life support , " Hope said .
" If an unsigned player sustained a massive injury on or off the ice , the drafting team would get a compensatory pick .
" We believe that the letter of the law applies in this case , but even if there is a disagreement on that , it 's clear that the spirit of the law applies . "
Rangers general manager Glen Sather first put the matter on the table in Chicago last month at the league 's GM meetings , the Post reported .
" At this point , the league has taken no position on the Rangers ' request , " NHL deputy commissioner Bill Daly told the newspaper .
" The matter is in front of the league 's general managers , who will address the subject at their next meeting in March .
" It 's possible that the language of the CBA would need to be amended to address situations such as this one .
If that 's the case , then we would need to negotiate that with the Players ' Association . "
A French appeals court has over - ruled a decision to annul the marriage of a couple because the bride had lied about being a virgin .
The Muslim couple are now legally married again even though both parties said they accepted the original court decision to annul the marriage .
That judgement had outraged feminists across France , who said it amounted to a fatwa against women 's liberties .
The husband 's lawyer argued that the wife had breached the wedding contract and tricked her husband into marriage .
Under the French civil code , a marriage can be annulled if a spouse has lied about a quote " essential quality " of the relationship .

Utah 's First Geothermal Plant in Over 20 Years Completed
November 7th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
Raser Technologies announced this week that it has completed construction of a plant on top of one of the United States ’ largest geothermal hotbeds to be discovered in over 25 years — so large that Raser believes it could power one third of all homes in Utah .
The plant , which is also the first to be completed in Utah in over 20 years , was constructed in only six months time using proprietary technology developed by Raser .
Most geothermal plants take five to seven years to complete .
Raser ’s 10 MW plant will utilize a new low temperature technology invented by UTC Power .
The technology generates electrical power with zero greenhouse gas emissions .
Over the next few months , Raser will complete the commissioning process for the plant .
The company hopes that it will be fully functional before 2009 .
Now that Raser has proven that speedy construction of geothermal plants is possible , expect to see more sites popping up quickly in the future .

Dumb Racer Fails to Ghost Ride
break.com -
Ghost Riding is an art perfected by Bay Area rappers that this European racer has n't quite been able to master yet .
Here is the video project I ’ve been working on .
Part documentary , part op - ed , it tries to make the case that the game nobody is talking about is the most innovative game of 2008 .
This game is a gateway drug .
And we need more of those .
Navel - gazing follows : I ’m not thrilled with how it turned out .
I ’m not crazy about the titles & credits , there are clicks and pops in a couple of spots because Windows Movie Maker sucks , I had to cut most of my crude and feeble attempts at humor to meet the 10 - minute YouTube limit , and my diction was sloppy in a couple of places .
And while I ’m at it , “ Reset Button ” probably is n’t the most catchy or original thing to call it , but you gotta call it something .
I thought I should call it something retro and old - timey .
Maybe “ Penny Arcade ” ?
I should Google and see if anyone is using that .
Ah well .
I ’ve wanted to get this out of my system for a while now .
I imagine it will stand or fall based on the ideas it contains , not on my various technical deficiencies .
Now that I ’ve sufficiently lowered your expectations , here is the fruit of my labors :
1,000 geek points to whoever can identify the music in the end credits .
And I ’m serious about the question I ask towards the end :
Do you need a game to punish you for failure in order to enjoy victory ?
( I ’m not just talking about blocking progress until you overcome the challenge , but taking away existing progress when you fail . )
Does making the punishment more punitive make winning more fun ?
Share and enjoy .
TOKYO ( Reuters ) -
The world ’s oldest man celebrated his 113th birthday on Thursday , telling reporters at his home in southern Japan about his joyful life and healthy appetite .
“ I ’m happy , ” said Tomoji Tanabe as the local mayor presented him with flowers and a giant tea cup glazed with his name and date of birth .
“ I ’m well .
I eat a lot , ” he added .
Tanabe , recognized by the Guinness Book of World Records as the oldest living male last year , eats mostly vegetables and believes the key to longevity is not drinking alcohol .
The former civil servant lives with his son , drinks milk every day and has no major illnesses , although he now writes in his diary only once or twice a month .
He used to write on a daily basis .
“ His favorite food is fried shrimp , but we ’ve heard that he ’s cut back on oily food , ” said an official at his hometown of Miyakonojo , about 900 km ( 560 miles ) southwest of Tokyo .
“ He ’s said he wants to live for another 10 years , that he does n’t want to die . ”
The Japanese are among the world ’s longest - lived people , with the number of those aged 100 or older at a record 36,276 , a government report last week showed .
Japanese women have topped the world ’s longevity ranks for 23 years , while men rank third after Iceland and Hong Kong .
" We all five have reached an agreement to request from the commission an immediate hearing session in order to announce our confessions ... with our earnest desire in this regard without being under any kind of pressure , threat , intimidations or promise from any party , " the note said .
If there 's one part of the coming Obama Presidency that I 'm not looking forward to , it 's his " voluntary " but also " universal " national service plan .
Some of this stuff is unobjectionable : expanding AmeriCorps , and doubling the size of the Peace Corps .
But then there 's the mandatory part of his voluntary service scheme , and here I 'll let the Obama - Biden web site speak for itself : " Obama and Biden will set a goal that all middle and high school students do 50 hours of community service a year .
They will develop national guidelines for service - learning and will give schools better tools both to develop programs and to document student experience . "
Putting aside the question of the educational value of community service , there 's simply nothing voluntary about forcing middle and high school students to do 50 hours of community service a year .
Obama may have carried the youth vote , voters between the ages of 18 and 29 , by a 66 to 32 margin , but I bet if kids in middle and high school could vote and they knew about Obama 's plan to conscript them into this national community service program , his margin among that age group would have been a lot slimmer although he still would 've won handily because the Republicans , thanks to their intransigence on social issues , have lost an entire generation of voters , but more on that in another post .
Middle school and high school were bad enough without having to do hundreds of hours of community service .
I can only hope that this sort of thing wo n't get through Congress , and just this once I 'm thankful that education policy is handled primarily at the state and local level .
And as ever , I 'm glad that I 'm no longer a student .
Obama 's web site also suggests that he 'll " require 100 hours of service in college , " another frightening prospect , but there 's some ambiguity here because it seems as though this might be truly voluntary community service that you would do in exchange for a $ 4,000 tax credit .
If it is mandatory , I suggest all college students try to graduate as fast possible , before this has a chance to become the law of the land .
As far as I 'm concerned , this is yet another attack on the young by the political class .
Obama 's clearly a brilliant man , but how can he be so stupid when it comes to national service ?
You can't teach American kids civics by forcing them to do community service work .
We 're stubborn , in fact , that 's our singular national virtue .
For a guy who spends so much time decrying cynicism , he sure seems to be pushing a program that will make the next generation even more cynical than me and my millennial buddies , and we 're a tough act to follow .
Call me a skeptic , but this " Ve haf vays of making you serve " program just does n't seem like the kind of thing that encourages civic - mindedness .
In general , coercion does n't tend to produce good results .
Here 's to hoping that " national service " itself was a cynical ploy on Obama 's part and he 'll forget all about once he takes office .
Hey , Mr. President , leave those kids alone !

Txeroki is suspected by police of killing two police officers in December 2007
The suspected military chief of the Basque separatist group , Eta , has been arrested in southern France .
Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero called the arrest of Mikel Garikoitz Aspiazu Rubina , alias " Txeroki " , a " severe blow " to Eta .
Mr Garikoitz Aspiazu is suspected of the murder of two Spanish civil guard officers in France in 2007 .
Eta is blamed for the deaths of more than 820 people in its 40 - year campaign for an independent Basque nation .
The arrest of Mr Garikoitz Aspiazu , 35 , which took place overnight in the Hautes - Pyrenees region of France , follows the detention of Eta 's alleged political commander , Javier Lopez Pena , in a joint Spanish - French operation in the French city of Bordeaux in May .
However , the BBC's Steve Kingstone in Madrid says that , in the past , high - profile arrests have always been followed by fresh attacks and Eta is far from defeated .
KEY ETA ARRESTS May 2008 : Political leader Javier Lopez Pena held in Bordeaux July 2007 : Logistics chief Juan Cruz Maiza Artola detained in Rodez , southern France October 2004 : Long - time political leader Mikel Albizu arrested in Salies de Bearn , southern France December 2002 : Military leader Ibon Fernandez Iradi held in southern France
Timeline : Eta's campaign Profile : Mikel Garikoitz Aspiazu Rubina Eta down but not out " Today Eta is weaker and Spanish democracy is stronger , " Mr Zapatero said .
But he admitted Eta would still be a threat .
" It has not lost its ability to attack all citizens ; it has not lost its ability to cause pain ; but with this arrest it has suffered a severe blow . "
The group resumed its campaign of violence in June 2007 , following the failure of secret dialogue with the Spanish government .
Correspondents say Mr Garikoitz Aspiazu was a key figure in the decision .
Police deaths Please turn on JavaScript .

Advertisement The Basque news agency , Vasco Press , said that Mr Garikoitz Aspiazu , whose nickname means Cherokee , had been detained along with another suspected Eta member in the town of Cauterets .
The French interior ministry did not provide any other details about the arrest , but said he was " suspected of being the perpetrator " of the murder of two Spanish civil guard officers in Capbreton on 1 December 2007 .
" This arrest shows again the resolute commitment of the French police and gendarmerie in the fight against all forms of terrorism and illustrates once again the excellent co-operation between France and Spain in the fight against Basque terrorism , " the French statement added .
The two Spanish civil guards were shot during a surveillance operation on suspected Eta members .
Their deaths prompted thousands of Spaniards to denounce the separatist group at a march in the capital , Madrid .
French police arrested a man and a woman over the attack several days later - but said at the time they were looking for a third suspect .
HAVE YOUR SAY
Like any army , Eta has a chain of command : when one goes down another takes her or his place Gerard Mulholland , Paris , France Earlier this month , Spanish Interior Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba said two recently arrested suspected Eta members had said Mr Garikoitz Aspiazu had told them he had participated directly in the shooting .
One of them had said he " heard Txeroki recognise that he was the assassin of the two policemen , " he added .
Eta suffered a major blow in May with the arrest of Mr Lopez Pena , alias " Thierry " , along with three other suspected members of the group .
Mr Lopez Pena is alleged to have ordered the December 2006 bombing of Madrid 's airport , which ended the 14 - month - old ceasefire with the government and killed two people .

In the span between the pseudo - conclusion of the recount last Friday , and today , the flow of actual information has essentially ceased ; having been replaced by the battle over public perception .
With the first round of challenge withdrawals having already taken place , each candidate decided a second round was in order .
The Franken campaign lead , again by releasing the following statement on December 9th at 9:43 AM CT :
The Franken campaign announced today that it was withdrawing an additional 425 ballot challenges , bringing the total number of challenges withdrawn by Franken to 1,058 .
Source : Al Franken For Senate
Coleman was again , late to the withdrawing party ; issuing this release about 8 hours later at 5:33 PM CT :
The Coleman for Senate campaign today announced it would be withdrawing an additional 475 challenged ballots ahead of the Minnesota State Canvassing Board meeting to review these ballots next week .
On Thursday , December 4 , the campaign withdrew 650 challenges for a total of 1,125 challenges withdrawn by the Coleman campaign .
Source : Norm Coleman For Senate
The Secretary of State 's data does not exclude these withdrawn challenges , so its impossible to draw any trends about these challenges beyond simple arithmetic .
If all withdrawn challenges are factored into the publicly available challenge count , a new challenge count emerges :
Current Withdrawn Franken : 2,220 1,058 Coleman : 2,292 1,125 Total : 4,514 2,183 Margin : 72 67
Its is absolutely impossible to know how these challenges will break , but we do know that Franken currently trails by at least 180 votes .
Using this assumption , I created functions for each candidate 's challenge gains as a function of the total number of relevant challenges ; these functions are shown below :
180 = Franken - Coleman x = Franken + Coleman
Where x is the number challenges directly adding to either candidate 's total .
Here 's an example ; lets assume x is 3,000 meaning that out of the 4,514 total challenges , only 3,000 of them actually resulted in either candidate gaining votes :
180 = Franken - Coleman 3000 = Franken + Coleman 3000 = ( 180 + Coleman ) + Coleman 2820 = 2 ( Coleman ) 1410 = Coleman 1590 = Franken
So if there are 3,000 additive challenges , Franken must win 53 % of them .
The graph below illustrates the above relationship for all values of x ranging between 180 and 4514 :
There is absolutely no data available to access the relative difficulty associated with reaching any challenge percentage in the above graph .
The graph simply presents the outcome necessary for a Franken victory based on the currently available data .
DUNDEE , FLORIDA – Polk County Sheriff ’s detectives arrested two Donald E. Woods Alternative School teachers today for possession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia .
During a routine search for drugs at the Dundee school , Sheriff ’s Office School Resource detectives found marijuana in a student ’s jacket .
Upon further investigation , a confidential source tipped off detectives about the two teachers , according to a Sheriff ’s Office report .
One teacher , Bradley Michael Goldsmith , 25 , of 5606 Loma Vista Court , in Davenport , admitted to socially smoking marijuana at his home .
The other suspects , who live in the same residence , are Jessica Allison Murray , 26 , who is also a Donald E. Woods teacher , and her boyfriend , Jason West , 26 .
They also admitted to smoking marijuana at the home , the Sheriff ’s Office said .
When the detectives searched the home , they found one large bong , five glass pipes , one cannabis grinder , and marijuana .
Goldsmith , Murray and West were arrested and transported to the Polk County Jail , each facing charges of possession of cannabis , possession of drug paraphernalia , and maintaining a dwelling for drug use .

A reader writes :
I love to see you grapple with trying to explain this woman and her thought processes .
You are missing something obvious though .
She believes in the literal truth of the Bible .
She believes it informs on matters of science , biology , evolution , physics , cosmology , etc .
So if there are multiple creation versions in the Bible what do you do , make up your own reality .
If there are contradictions in it , ignore them .
Just like you ignore inconvenient facts about day - to - day life .
If you BELIEVE the bible is the literal inerrant word of God what do you do ?
Well then you ignore all contrary facts , like the earth revolving around the sun , like the age of the earth .
You are seeing in Sarah Palin the fact that she has translated her biblical literalism into a way of attempting to deal with the real world and hence as you put it , her alternative universe .
I think what is going on is that she has internalized the fundamentalist way of thinking to such a degree that she no longer has much of a grip on reality .
She has taught herself to ignore reality in matters of faith and has transposed that way of thinking into her regular life .
The first chapter of my book on how conservatism destroyed itself in America is called " The Fundamentalist Psyche . "
I do n't think you can understand what happened under Bush and what Palin represents unless you grapple with the mindset that can deny empirical truth in favor of Divine Truth .
The resistance to debate , the inability to see your own faults and errors , your final surrender to the will of the Almighty as a way to cope with the massive errors involved in your own management of the material world : this is Bush 's world and Palin 's world .
Their magical thinking , combined with the mainstream media 's defensive crouch , made a great deal possible .
And Cheney took advantage .
It can work for a while .
But real conservatives know that dogma can never work in managing a fallen world .
In the end , it collapses .
And Obama walked confidently over the wreckage .
Until conservatives understand this , there will be no recovery .

How Do Our 42 US Presidents Rank as Leaders ?
( Part Two of Three )
Where does your favorite President of the United States rank in terms of business leadership in the new millennium ?
Could all or any of the US Presidents successfully run a large corporation today ?
Did they have what it takes to be a true leader or were they more concerned about themselves and their legacy ?
Were their decisions sound and founded on unwavering principles , or were they constantly swayed by the winds of political expediency and public opinion ?
Running the United States and running a large , for - profit corporation have more similarities than differences .
Whom would we choose to run our company if we had our pick from the 42 men who served as President of the United States ?
The editors at AskTheManager.com scoured the history books and looked deeply at each President ’s record as a leader .
We ignored the popularity of their decisions and judged these men solely on the traits that we feel make a good leader : the ability to execute ; honor ; intelligence ; character ; and , most of all , service .
To determine the final rankings , we graded each President on six weighted categories : humility ; delegation ; integrity ; vision ; success ( during their term ) ; and ( impact on ) future ( generations ) .
This is the second article in a three - series post .
Please see yesterday ’s post by following this link for our “ worst to first ” rankings of the US Presidents .
Today we bring you the leadership ranking of the Presidents , with the promised notes associated with each :
The Top 10 Presidential Leaders of All Time
The greatest Leader - Presidents ever , we ’d happily serve under any of these 10 distinguished men :
1. George Washington ( 1789 - 1797 )
Entrepreneurs understand how hard it is to start a new business , imagine starting a whole country !
Often underrated , Washington is truly a “ leader ’s leader ” in that he was always able to get the most out of other leaders , without hurting their egos or resulting to power struggles .
In 1787 , he presided over the Philadelphia Convention that drafted the United States Constitution and two years later he became the first President of the United States .
An enlightened leader , Washington even used his farewell speech to warn against the pitfalls of partisanship and involvement in foreign wars .
Kind of makes you wish the other 41 men on this list would have listened to him , does n’t it ?
AskThe Manager proudly proclaims George Washington as the Best Presidential Leader of all time .
2. Abraham Lincoln ( 1861 -1865 )
The 16th President of the United States , Lincoln led the US through it ’s greatest crisis – the Civil War .
Throughout his life and his Presidency , Lincoln showed great regard for his fellow man and a tremendous sense of honor and integrity .
If not for Washington , Lincoln would be number 1 – but number 2 on this list is n’t a bad thing .
For all Lincoln accomplished from a leadership point of view , he is the 2nd best President who ever served .
3. Thomas Jefferson ( 1801 - 1809 )
Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence , e’s on Rushmore for a reason , and in some ways he was the most successful Leader - President ever .
He was a selfless leader who was one of the first to embrace “ empowerment ” by advocating states rights .
Though he did n’t always agree with his own decisions , he chose a path he felt was the best for this country .
As a leader , Thomas Jefferson is the 3rd best President of all time .
4. Harry S Truman ( 1945 - 1953 )
“ The Man From Independence ” made the toughest decision in the history of the US Presidency : to be the first and only world leader to drop nuclear weapons on his enemies .
His decision no doubt saved the lives of hundreds of thousands of American soldiers and effectively ended World War II .
The Manager asks : would any of us be willing to make the same decision for the sake of freedom ?
Nearly hated when he left office , he was a humble leader who executed his agenda very well .
Truman is clearly the 4th best Leadership President ever .
5. John Adams ( 1797 - 1801 )
It ’s tough being second .
While John Adams was only a one - term President , he was actually a very competent , if not reluctant , leader .
He life story is dotted with chapters of selflessness and sacrifice .
He never seemed to put himself ahead of the needs of the country or the mission at hand .
A great Adams ’ story involves the defense of British soldiers accused in the Boston Massacre of 1770 .
Despite his feelings for the British Government and facing a loss of reputation in America , Adams vigorously defended the eight soldiers against the charges .
Because his Presidency could also be characterized as one of service to the people , John Adams is the 5th best Leader - President ever .
6. Woodrow Wilson ( 1913 - 1921 )
Thomas Woodrow Wilson was the consummate leader of his time .
He defied his party ( he was a Democrat ) to pass a conservative Republican - backed initiative to create the Federal Reserve System .
Most men would have towed the party line , though Wilson did what he felt was best for America .
He understood that he served us , rather than the other way around .
7. Jimmy Carter ( 1977 - 1981 )
One of the last honest Presidents , Jimmy Carter was the first true environmentalist to ever hold the office ( do n’t try to tell us about Roosevelt , Carter actually cared about the environment ) .
Though vilified by some , he showed great courage in boycotting the 1980 Summer Olympics in the Soviet Union – even though this move likely cost him a second term .
Carter was never concerned with himself or his cronies , and once asked for the resignation of several of his cabinet members .
Carter was one of the most selfless Presidents to ever serve the United States , and he seemed grateful every day that America allowed him to serve .
8. Franklin D. Roosevelt ( 1933 - 1945 )
FDR served four terms ( a record , of course ) and created government programs back when we actually needed government programs .
Without the New Deal , we probably would have been in a recession at least another two or three years .
Not really worthy of Mt. Rushmore in The Manager ’s view , but still not bad given the alternatives .
FDR did what he did to help America — a true servant leader .
9. James K. Polk ( 1845 -1849 )
Polk made the Top Ten primarily because he exercised leadership skills in the 1840s that would be admired today .
More specifically , Polk knew how to execute .
If he set an agenda , Polk accomplished it .
While President , he oversaw the expansion of territory in the US by more than 750,000 square miles .
He was a great negotiator and very adept at foreign policy .
Though he was the 11th US President , James K. Polk is the 9th best Leadership President of all time .
10 . Grover Cleveland ( 1885 -1889 and 1893-1897 )
Cleveland is the only US President to ever serve two non-consecutive terms .
Technically speaking , he was our 22nd and our 24th Presidents .
Known as a President dedicated to his principles , he is most often characterized as honest , intelligent and independent .
Just the qualities we ’re looking for in a True Leader .
Deservedly so , Grover Cleveland is the 10th Best Presidential Leader of All Time .
The Above Average Presidential Leaders
Above average among this group says you were something special .
These fourteen Presidents clearly distinguished themselves by providing exceptional leadership during their terms in office :
11 . Ronald Reagan ( 1981 -1989 )
The Great Communicator should have been called The Great Delegator .
Ronald Reagan epitomized leading through others , and was so respected at the end of his first term that he won 49 of 50 states ( what were you thinking Minnesota ? ) in the 1984 Presidential Election .
His hard stance on Communism during the Cold War was a 180 on the detente of the previous administration , and eventually led to the dismantling of the Soviet Union and the fall of the Berlin Wall .
If not for record ( at the time ) deficit spending during his term , he would likely rank in the top ten .
12 . Dwight D. Eisenhower ( 1953 - 1961 )
We like Ike , really we do .
What we really like about President Eisenhower is he had the ability to forgo immediate gratification for the sake of the future .
Most of his greatest accomplishments benefited those not even alive during his Presidency .
The US Interstate Highway System and America ’s space program are just two examples of his visionary leadership .
Even forgetting that he successfully led the Allied Forces in Europe during World War II , Ike clearly deserves to be ranked as the 12th Best Leader - President in history .
13 . ( tie ) William Howard Taft ( 1909 - 1913 )
Taft ’s determined action against trusts and his strengthening of the Interstate Commerce Commission prove he believed his mission as President was not to glorify himself , but to leave a lasting legacy on the people of the United States .
Although Teddy Roosevelt helped him get elected to his first term , he chose principles over party for the second term and broke with the self - centered Roosevelt .
An honorable man , Taft served as a capable Chief Justice of the Supreme Court for nearly nine years after he left office .
13 . ( tie ) James Monroe ( 1817 - 1825 )
The Presidency of James Monroe is characterized by all the things we want in a leader ( and a President ) today .
He was pragmatic , honest and non-partisan .
He made strong cabinet choices based on qualifications and not on personal greed or cronyism .
His greatest accomplishments include the acquisition of Florida and the Monroe Doctrine .
Though the Missouri Compromise would later be found to be unconstitutional , its passage at the time was considered important for the country .
15 . John F. Kennedy ( 1961 - 1963 )
A second son , JFK was a leader ’s leader .
He held to his resolve and proved to be wise beyond his years .
At 43 , he was the second youngest ever elected to the office of President .
His service in WWII , and as a both a representative and a senator proved to be too much for the current VP at the time , Richard Nixon .
While we will never know how much he could have meant to the US , his stance against the growth of communism worldwide , and his creation of the Peace Corps domestically prove he understood the future better than most Presidents .
16 . Calvin Coolidge ( 1923-1929 )
Although he was given the nickname “ Silent Cal , ” Coolidge uttered many phrases that defined his Presidency .
“ The business of America is business ” was one such phrase that belied his belief that the role of the government should be small and that American businesses would drive prosperity and growth .
We tend to agree with Silent Cal .
A leader of high integrity and distinguished for his character , Coolidge was one of those “ accidental Presidents ” who served their country first and themselves last .
Known best for creating prosperity without the involvement of the Federal government , Coolidge lowered taxes and government spending during his term , proving that the nation could grow without government programs and increased spending .
17 . Lyndon B. Johnson ( 1963 - 1969 )
LBJ earns high marks for his work to improve civil rights and alleviate poverty – as well as the creation of Medicare and Medicaid – though his escalation of troop levels during the Vietnam War proved to be the beginning of a disastrously terrible chapter in American history .
To his credit , Johnson ’s decisions seemed to be based on what he thought was best for the country , not necessarily what he thought was best for his party or his own political career .
In fact , he signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 with the firm belief that it would lead to the loss of Southern votes in future elections .
This demonstrated a level of high integrity that we ’ve rarely seen from a President since .
18 . John Quincy Adams ( 1825-1829 )
The son of the second President , John Q was actually a better diplomat and negotiator than he was a President .
That ’s not to say he did a poor job in the White House , he was simply stunning as Secretary of State in drafting the Monroe Doctrine ( among many other achievements ) .
As President , he had a great eye for the future : Adams championed such needed US improvement as roads , universities and canals without concern for reelection ( which he did not achieve ) .
A selfless leader with great vision , John Quincy Adams is often underrated on lists like these .
19 . James Madison ( 1809 - 1817 )
As the “ Author of The Constitution ” and the “ Father of The Bill of Rights , ” Madison deserves some slack that historians rarely give him .
While usually ranked in the bottom 10 % of all Presidents , The Manager does n’t put as much weight on issues like declaring war against the British and causing the tremendous casualties inflicted during the War of 1812 , because Madison ’s intentions were not self - directed or self - serving .
Though not a great manager , he understood that power rested with the people – most leaders today still forget this .
As a Presidential Leader , Madison was certainly above average .
20 . Andrew Jackson ( 1829 -1837 )
“ Old Hickory ” led 5,000 Americans against 7,500 British troops in the Battle of New Orleans ( 1815 ) and won .
Not a completely unbelievable feat until you consider that he lost only 13 men compared to the British losses of more than 2,000 .
While in office , he is credited with greatly reducing the Federal deficit and sometimes blamed with the creation of the spoils system .
A strange dichotomy , to say the least , that puts him near the middle of the leadership rankings .
21 . George Bush ( 1989 - 1993 )
George H. W. Bush would probably rank higher on this list if not for his failure to keep one big promise : “ read my lips , no new taxes . ”
Burdened by the deficit created by Reagan , Bush went against his own better judgment and broke his word with the American people .
He would later regret the decision to raise taxes , but it would be too late – Bush was a one - term wonder .
22 . Millard Fillmore ( 1850 - 1853 )
Never elected President , Fillmore assumed office after the death of Zachary Taylor .
Taylor ’s cabinet was corrupt and Fillmore wasted no time in replacing them all – a bold move that more business leaders should consider today .
Fillmore also showed great courage in remaining neutral on Hungary ’s independence , event though it meant he would probably give up a chance at reelection .
23 . Theodore Roosevelt ( 1901 - 1909 )
The youngest ever to become President at age 42 , his gigantic personality and his record in battle sometime move him higher on lists like these .
The Manager would n’t put him on the Mt. Rushmore of Leadership , however , because many of his greatest accomplishments seemed more self - serving that the twenty - two Presidents ahead of him .
As true Presidential Leaders go , Roosevelt is just barely above average .
24 . William McKinley ( 1897 -1901 )
Assassinated just after starting his second term in office , William McKinley was a leader who defied the popular opinion on most issues in favor of what was best for America .
Although we fought the Spanish - American
War during his term in office , McKinley resisted at first , despite public sentiment that we should have fought much sooner .
Under McKinley , the war lasted all of four months .
McKinley would probably rank higher on this list if not for the many political appointments he made based on friendships and back - office bargains .
Our Below Average Presidential Leaders
It ’s important to note that the bell curve for Presidential Leaders is skewed to the left .
As you ’ll see in tomorrow ’s post , the average leadership score of all 42 Presidents is 75.4 ( out of 100 ) .
While no company wants a below average leader , most of the below average Presidents could essentially lead and lead well ( as here they are ranked against other Presidents , a stringent comparison ) .
The weighted grading used by the editors of AskTheManager assumes top leadership skills are present with a score of 66.7 or above – 2/3 of a perfect score .
All below average Presidents scored at least this much except for Zachary Taylor and Benjamin Harrison .
( To see all the score , please read tomorrow ’s post . )
25 . Martin Van Buren ( 1837 -1841 )
After serving as a US Senator , the Governor of New York ( albeit for two months ) , Secretary of State and Vice President , Van Buren brought his extensive experience to the office of President .
He has the distinction of being the first President to be born as an American citizen , and the third to serve only one term .
He was largely unsuccessful at improving the faltering economy of his day , and he was known to make decisions that were politically smart rather than those that were humanely right .
26 . Chester Arthur ( 1881 - 1885 )
Arthur , best known for reforming civil service during his Presidency , showed great courage in office by replacing all but one of his predecessor ’s cabinet in an effort to go his own way and avoid cronyism .
He also tried to lower tariff rates and instituted the first federal immigration laws , despite political pressures .
Not all of his decisions led to prosperity for the nation , though he certainly appeared to lead with the best intentions .
27 . Gerald Ford ( 1974 - 1977 )
An “ accidental President ” ( he never desired the top office ) Ford was often unfairly lampooned for his unintended pratfalls .
If not for the pardoning of Richard Nixon ( the worst Presidential Leader of all time ) , Ford would probably rank in the Top 20 .
His humility and his keen understanding of just how lucky he was to serve in the highest office in the land almost make us forget the terrible inflation and recession that occurred under his watch .
28 . Herbert Hoover ( 1929 - 1933 )
Although he completely mishandled the Great Depression , Hoover was actually not a terrible leader .
In fact , HH was quite a humanitarian and very progressive in his views on leadership .
His generosity toward war victims and his belief that leadership should be “ bottom up ” versus “ top down ” made him unique among US Presidents in his era .
He ’d rank above average on The Manager ’s list , if not for that pesky stock market crash and the unnecessary deepening of the recession during his term .
29 . Bill Clinton ( 1993 -2001 )
Forget about Bill Clinton ’s popularity , his integrity and his motives are so in question that he should feel lucky to be ranked in the top 30 Presidential Leaders of all time .
Many Americans have no idea how close Clinton came to being convicted of perjury and obstruction of justice charges ( and subsequently being thrown out of office ) .
The editors of AskThe Manager believe true leaders face the music and take their medicine ( to blend a couple of metaphors ) , and Bill Clinton did neither .
Sorry , President Clinton , but in leadership , integrity matters .
30 . William Henry Harrison ( 1841 )
The editors at AskTheManager.com feel bad even giving Harrison a grade ( he served just over one month ) , but he did serve , so we ’re left with grading him based on what he accomplished with those precious few days in office and his overall makeup as a leader .
His high integrity and perceived lack of ego tell us that he could have been a very good leader .
Unfortunately , we ’ll never know for sure , and based on his lack of notable legislation during his days in office , he ranks as a below average Presidential Leader .
31 . Zachary Taylor ( 1849 -1850 )
A fan of Nationalism , Taylor is sometimes viewed as a President who stood his ground on the expansion of slavery .
In fact , Taylor was a slave owner and merely was unwilling to give to either side on the issue of slavery .
Although his term in office was just over one year , the editors of AskThe Manager feel he was not going produce great leadership no matter how long he served .
His cabinet was corrupt and he was largely ineffective as a leader .
32 . Benjamin Harrison ( 1889 - 1893 )
Although Harrison ’s administration was instrumental in passing the Sherman Antitrust Act , his reliance on higher tariffs and excessive government spending cast a fog over his accomplishments .
His Presidency was largely non-descript , and he did very little to guarantee continued prosperity or liberty for America .
The Ten Worst Presidential Leaders of All Time
Shame , shame , shame .
These ten men might find it hard to run any business of significant size – certainly they would struggle if their businesses faced threats from the economy or competition .
Their lack of noticeable accomplishments and / or general lack of character distinguish this group as the worst Leader - Presidents ever :
33 . James A. Garfield ( 1881 )
Six months in office should give Garfield an “ NA ” in The Manager ’s book , but every President gets a ranking .
Besides that , his short stay in office was mostly spent squabbling with a rival over a political appointment .
He probably could have been a great leader , but Garfield ’s priorities were a little out of whack .
More time would likely have earned him a better grade , but based on his body of work as a leader , he ’s the 10th worst President of all time .
34 . Rutherford B. Hayes ( 1877 -1881 )
Hayes ’ inactivity during office seems more a result of the times than a laissez - faire attitude ( though we could be wrong ) .
The actions he did take , like ending Reconstruction with the Compromise of 1877 , were politically motivated .
While his decisions were often flawed , like sending federal troops to handle the Great Railroad Strike of 1877 , we do n’t fault Presidents for making bad decisions , unless they were made with bad intentions .
Hayes , it seems , may have done just that throughout his Presidency .
35 . Ulysses S. Grant ( 1869 -1877 )
A President who allowed , if not encouraged , corruption , Grant was not a servant leader and is often overrated on lists like these .
While he supported civil rights and cracked down on the Ku Klux Klan , the depression that occurred during his term ushered in a Democratic congress that made him relatively ineffective .
His scandal - ridden administration and reports of anti-Semitism tarnish his legacy .
36 . George W. Bush ( 2001 - 2009 )
It ’s always easy to attack the sitting President , though all politicians should be judged by history and not by current popular sentiment .
That said , the editors at AskTheManager were hard pressed to move W any higher on the list .
Many Presidents have had poor popularity ratings , though with W the low opinion seem to come from a definite lack of true leadership .
His poor handling of the Iraq War ( great leaders admit when they ’re wrong and they “ fish or cut bait ” ) and the fact that only 10 % of his top cabinet members appointed in 2001 are still with him today , are among the many issues that show Bush deserves to be ranked as the 7th worst Presidential Leader of all time .
37 . Andrew Johnson ( 1865 -1869 )
Johnson , vice President at the time of Lincoln ’s assassination , vetoed many civil rights acts and blocked the 14th Amendment because of his deep feelings of racism .
His policies , and his inability to play well with others , led to his impeachment in 1869 .
Andrew Johnson has the distinction of being the first US President ever impeached and AskTheManager ’s 6th worst President ever .
38 . Franklin Pierce ( 1853 - 1857 )
While Pierce assumed the Presidency at a very tranquil time , it did n’t take him long to find controversy as the slavery issue soon came to the forefront .
His handling of this and other problems sometimes ranks him as the worst President of all time , though it ’s important to note that no other US President has ever assembled a cabinet that remained together for the entire term .
Pierce accomplished this despite choosing men with very different backgrounds for his cabinet positions .
That , The Manager believes , shows some leadership skills , just not enough to keep him from being ranked as the 5th worst President of all time .
39 . John Tyler ( 1841 -1845 )
Tyler assumed office upon the death of Tippecanoe ( William Harrison ) and proceeded to lead so poorly that his entire cabinet quit ( save Daniel Webster ) and he was expelled from his party .
The ability to compromise and to build a consensus are important traits in a good leader – Tyler could do neither and was , therefore , a terrible leader and the 4th worst Presidential Leader of all time .
40 . Warren G. Harding ( 1921 - 1923 )
As leaders go , Harding was a joke .
Warren G. looked upon the White House and even the country as his personal play land , letting his cronies loot the government coffers while he looked the other way .
By all accounts , he never had an interest in helping the American people or leading anyone or anything .
While no one ever proved Harding ’s involvement in the illegal bribes and kickbacks during his administration , a true leader would never have allowed any of it to happen .
As a leader , Harding gets our vote for the 3rd worst President of all time .
41 . James Buchanan ( 1857 -1861 )
A do - nothing who allowed the South to secede from the Union , Buchanan was the only US President never to marry and the greatest ostrich manager of all time .
His head firmly buried in the sand , Buchanan ’s inability to lead led to the Civil War , while his refusal to deal with the slavery issue makes him , in The Manager ’s eyes , a coward among cowards .
Cowardice has no place in leadership , therefore Buchanan is by our accounts , the 2nd worst President in history .
42 . Richard Nixon ( 1969 - 1974 )
When we look strictly at Tricky Dick ’s leadership abilities , we cannot help but be appalled by the incredible paranoia that led to the Watergate break - in and his criminal behavior that followed .
While The Manager believes much of what Nixon accomplished ( like creating the EPA and OSHA ) was with the best intentions , there are no excuses for his imperialism , the secret bombings during the Vietnam War , and his disastrous wage and price controls .
Congratulations Dick , as a leader , you are the worst President of all time .
It ’s important to note that these rankings are based on how these Presidents , their traits , their character and their decisions would impact a Fortune 500 company .
Are they capable of true leadership or were they just popular pawns of their party ?
To see the final scores and rankings in each of the six weighted categories : humility ; delegation ; integrity ; vision ; success ( during their term ) ; and ( their impact on ) future ( generations ) , please follow this link .
As we grow ever closer to the November 4 , 2008 Presidential Election , the real question for America is where would Barack Obama , John McCain , Joe Biden or Sarah Palin rank on this list ?
With the current economic climate and uncertain foreign affairs , it ’s clear we need a leader .

Russian President Dmitry Medvedev , arriving in Washington for international economic talks , Saturday struck a conciliatory tone toward the United States and expressed hope that President - elect Barack Obama will help improve the deteriorating U.S. - Russian relationship .
Medvedev , who spoke defiantly of the United States hours after Obama was elected , told an audience at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington that Russia believes Obama will act to overcome problems that have been accumulating in the relationship between the two countries .
He said he believed that a meeting with Obama should take place soon , and felt that Obama shared that view .
Obama has said that he wants better ties with Moscow .
In his Nov. 5 speech , which was widely taken as a challenge to the incoming U.S. president , Medvedev signaled that Moscow was ready to deploy missiles near Poland in response to U.S. plans to build a missile defense system in Poland and the Czech Republic .
He clarified Saturday that his government had no intention of delploying missiles at the present , but reserved the right to respond to the missile defense system .
Russia considers the system a first step toward countering its huge missile arsenal , though U.S. officials insist that it is intended to deal with what they say is a potential missile threat from Tehran .

“ We will not do anything until America takes the first step , ” said Medvedev , who took questions from former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and others .
“ Hopefully a new president and a new administration will have a willingness to deal with this problem . ”
Medvedev lamented that there was “ no trust ” in the U.S. - Russian relationship .
The Russian leadership has been eager to engage Obama ’s team as soon as possible on the missile defense issue and other matters , including concern over Georgia ’s breakaway republic of South Ossetia .
Obama has been more cautious on the missile defense system than have Bush administration officials , saying he would consider supporting it if there was proof that it will work .
Some scientists question whether the system , not yet complete , will be effective .
Though some Obama advisors have been urging a more conciliatory course , it would be difficult for the new administration to quickly defuse the difficult issues , analysts say .
Obama will not want to make any concessions that would be seen as abandoning Eastern European allies such as Georgia and Ukraine .

Medvedev also made a pitch for a new European security organization that would include all of Europe , Russia , the United States and Canada , and would not replace current security groups such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization .
He said such a group could have helped avoid the war in Georgia in August by providing a forum for discussion .
Medvedev said Russia had little interest at the moment in joining NATO , pointing out that NATO had considered , but rejected , the idea of integrating Russia in the early 1990s .
“ Now , the situation is a bit different , ” he said .
But he added that Russia has not ruled out the idea for all time , saying “ never say never . ”

Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni has warned the US vice president - elect against changing the Bush White House policies toward Iran .
“ It is of the utmost importance that we keep up our coordination against the Iranian threat because time is not on the side of the moderates , ” the ministry quoted Livni as saying in a telephone conversation with Senator Joe Biden on Monday .
Her remarks come amid speculation that president - elect Barack Obama would engage Iran in direct negotiations over the country ’s nuclear program .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
Tel Aviv , the sole possessor of a nuclear arsenal in the Middle East , has long alleged that Iran is trying to build a nuclear weapon , while arguing that the use of military force is a legitimate option in halting the Iranian program .
“ We do n’t rule out any option .
We recommend others do n’t rule out any option either , ” said Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak on Friday .

Comment on this article
Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney appear to be giving more interviews than their recent predecessors .
Dan Quayle , the last vice president not to seek the presidency while in office , gave three exit interviews ; Mr. Cheney has so far given four .
President Ronald Reagan gave five interviews during his last two months in office ; President Bill Clinton gave seven .
Mr. Bush has already given 10 , to outlets as varied as Real Clear Politics , the Pentagon Channel , an Arabic television channel and a sportswriter for The Washington Post ; the White House says more are to come .
Historians say presidents , especially those who serve two terms , often grow reflective at the end of their tenure .
“ They tend to be exhausted , they ’re worn out , they ’re trying to make some sense of their administrations , and there ’s a natural tendency for them to want to give their own perspective , ” said Jay Winik , who got to know Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney after they read his book , “ April 1865 , ” an account of the last month of the Civil War .
Never the introspective type , Mr. Bush has been freely answering “ how do you feel ” queries , which he once routinely dismissed as “ goo - goo questions , ” said his first press secretary , Ari Fleischer .
He has also used his interviews to reveal his softer side .
He has spoken of “ my relationship with the Good Lord , ” joked about his wife ’s cooking and spotlighted social programs he regards as achievements , like education reform and his global plan to fight AIDS .
If he has criticisms of President - elect Barack Obama , Mr. Bush has not shared them ; rather , he has hewed to the Bush family credo of graciousness in departure or defeat .
( “ I think he ’s discovered his inner Bush , ” Mr. Berman , the adviser , said . )
He also opened the door to a possible role for himself in the Obama presidency , citing his own decision to ask his father , the first President Bush , and Mr. Clinton to spearhead a fund - raising effort for tsunami victims .
“ President - elect Obama , I am confident , will call upon presidents to take on a mission , ” Mr. Bush told C - Span .
“ I will be happy to do it , particularly if I agree with the mission . ”
Mr. Cheney has been less diplomatic .
Like Mr. Bush , he has praised Mr. Obama for keeping Robert M. Gates as defense secretary .
But on “ Fox News Sunday ” this week , Mr. Cheney shot back at Mr. Biden for calling him “ the most dangerous vice president in history . ”
And asked by The Washington Times for his advice for Mr. Obama , Mr. Cheney talked of the importance of personnel decisions , then volunteered , “ Senator Clinton as secretary of state  I would never pick her to be my secretary of state . ”
Both men say they look forward to private life .
For Mr. Cheney , who has served in four Republican administrations , transitions are nothing new .
“ It ’s not my first time at the rodeo , ” he told The Washington Times .
Mr. Bush , who became Texas governor 14 years ago , told ABC News that he was eager to “ live life without the limelight . ”
Yet both will have more to say .
Mr. Cheney is likely to write a book .
Mr. Bush is contemplating a farewell address , and says he will definitely write a book , to give Americans , as he told The Washington Times , “ one man ’s point of view that happened to be in the center of it all . ”

Three states , one set of false statements
by Jeremy Hooper
You may think all of the various attempts to amend state constitutions so that they ban marriage equality are cut from the same discriminatory cloth .
And you , dear reader , would be absolutely right .
The " cruelness hidden behind a compassionate mask " thing is pretty much the same concept no matter where it is espoused .
" Protect marriage " always means a million things other than actually protecting marriage .
Going to the polls to vote against your fellow citizen is always an act of hostility , no matter the rationale .
However , someone has apparently told Focus on the Family that there 's some sort of difference between the way they hide their biased actions behind code - wording from one state to another .
That 's the only reason we can figure why they would make three different - yet - virtually - identical videos exploring the subtle nuances between their attempts to bastardize civil liberties in Arizona , Florida , and California :

In the beginning
If you 're in your early thirties , you might have fond memories of playing Sonic the Hedgehog , Altered Beast , or Streets of Rage on a Sega Genesis .
After the happy - go - lucky innocence of the NES era , the Genesis introduced millions of Americans to an edgier , more mature gaming aesthetic .
Despite its success in the New World , the Genesis did n't originate in the United States .
It started as the Sega Mega Drive , released in Japan 20 years ago .
Originally retailing for ¥ 21,000 ( about $ 163 in 1988 dollars ) , the Mega Drive inaugurated a brief period of console market domination by Sega , selling 30 million units worldwide in its various forms .
It significantly influenced the course of console gaming , while also inspiring some of the most odd and interesting moments in video game history .
Five ways the Genesis changed console gaming
It started the 16 - bit era
In the 1980s , 8 - bit microprocessors reigned in most video game consoles — partly due to their low cost and partly due to familiarity .
16 - bit CPUs had been around since the 1970s , but they remained prohibitively expensive for low - cost consumer products until the late 1980s , when they steadily decreased in price .
This new breed of processors gave companies a great chance to one - up the competition through improvement and innovation .
Sega did exactly that when it designed a new console , the Mega Drive , based on its powerful 16 - bit arcade hardware .
With the release of the Mega Drive , Sega inaugurated a new technological era in the game console arms race .
( It should be noted that NEC claimed its TurboGrafx - 16 console was a 16 - bit system , but in truth , it possessed an 8 - bit CPU . )
At the heart of this new console lay a Motorola 68000 CPU — the same processor that powered the Apple Macintosh , Commodore Amiga , and Atari ST personal computers .
Running at 7.67MHz , the Mega Drive processor blew the Super NES 's 3.58 MHz CPU out of the water in terms of raw speed and processing power .
Had the Genesis not come along , Nintendo would have been perfectly happy to continue squeezing every ounce ( and dollar ) out of its aging 8 - bit Nintendo Entertainment System ( NES ) hardware as long as it possibly could .
But after the Genesis shipped , there was no looking back ; technology had moved on , and the market moved with it .
It knocked Nintendo out of complacency
Flush with the overwhelming success of the NES , Nintendo was as arrogant as they came during the turn of the 1990s .
After thoroughly trouncing the Sega Master System ( Sega 's 8 - bit console ) in the United States , Nintendo did n't consider Sega 's new 16 - bit machine a threat , providing the perfect window for Sega to slip in right under Nintendo 's nose .
By the time Nintendo snapped out of its heady daze , Sega owned 55 percent of the 16 - bit marketplace .
Nintendo did eventually wake up , however ; through intensified marketing efforts with its Super NES console ( originally released in 1991 ) , Nintendo ultimately pulled ahead in total sales , just as the 16 - bit era was ending .
It gave us Sonic the Hedgehog
After the incredible success that was Super Mario Bros. worldwide , Nintendo solidified its corporate identity behind Mario , a pudgy plumber in blue overalls .
The image of Mario in the minds of America 's youth was strong ; in some surveys , more children could identify Mario than Mickey Mouse .
Sega soon realized that it needed a mascot as well .
Its answer came in the form of a blue anthropomorphic hedgehog capable of running at incredible speeds .
Sonic the Hedgehog burst onto the scene in his self - titled 1991 debut , selling millions of copies and stunning the industry .
Sonic was cool , fast , and edgy compared to Nintendo 's plodding plumber , and he soon wedged his way into the minds of American youth on equal terms with Mario .
Sonic the Hedgehog became the Genesis 's first " killer app " — that one game that drove Genesis system sales to new heights and fueled Sega 's domination of the market .
Without Sonic , it 's possible that the Genesis would have floundered and ultimately withered under the massive inertial might of Nintendo .
What could you do with thousands of dixie cups ?
Here 's a teacher - pranking - teacher moment , photographed for your enjoyment :
Every single one of those 10,000 dixie cups was full of water .
It took 10 people 3 hours to painstakingly set those things up and fill them .
Every single horizontal surface we could get to was covered .
There were even dixie cups in the desk drawers .
— The sluggish economy is starting to drag on the donations to charities and other nonprofits that rely heavily on corporate giving to meet their budgets .
" Corporate giving , like all charitable giving , is under a lot of stress and press because of the economy , " said Todd Cohen , editor of Philanthropy Journal .
Many companies base giving on net income , and foundations often rely on investment returns for gifts , Cohen said .
In general , both revenue streams are hurting in the recession and slumping stock market .
" It 's on everybody 's mind all the time these days , " he said .
The Philanthropy Journal hosted a training session Thursday for local nonprofits struggling to win over big donors .
" They 're being cautious .
They 're taking a look at where they 're going to invest their money , but it has not come to a standstill , " said Beth Briggs , a consultant with Creative Philanthropy in Raleigh .
Some companies get creative in their philanthropy , Briggs said .
Software developer Red Hat , for example , plans to forgo its holiday parties and use the savings to buy 800,000 meals for the needy .
The Blue Cross Blue Shield Foundation averages donations of about $ 7 million a year to health - related charities , and President Kathy Higgins said that wo n't change this year .
" Whether it 's tough economic times or just normal times , we 've been there for the not - for - profit community to help them elevate , " Higgins said .
A spokeswoman for Wachovia Corp. said that , despite thousands of job cuts and a pending acquisition by Wells Fargo & Co. , the bank is honoring its current commitments to charities .
Cisco Systems Inc. also plans to maintain its contributions this year , community relations manager Kirsten Weeks said .
" When the community is in need , that is when we really want to step up to the plate , and we 're seeing that with our employees , " Weeks said .
Corporate giving accounts for about 11 percent of the annual budget of the Food Bank of Central and Eastern North Carolina .
Food bank spokeswoman Christy Simmons said the organization feels fortunate that corporate donations have remained steady in the tight economy , but she noted that needs have risen 20 to 30 percent .
The tax break for charitable donations will help encourage some companies this year , but it 's unclear how a lengthy recession could impact corporate giving in 2009 , when corporate income may well be down and deductions less valuable .
" We have to support the things we care about and invest in those things , " Briggs said .
The Latest on Homicide Rates
Nothing grabs headlines like dire warnings about homicide trends .
And there is no criminologist better at garnering headlines than James Alan Fox , whom you might remember from Freakonomics for the ominous reports he produced about juvenile homicide for Attorney General Janet Reno in the 1990 ’s , even as crime began to plunge .
James Alan
Fox is baaaack with a new report that is garnering headlines .
The New York Times writes : “ Homicides by Black Teenagers Rise , Bucking a Trend . ”
The Wall Street Journal is even more precise : “ Murders of Black Teens Are Up 39 Percent Since 2000 - 01 , ” although actually murders by black teens are up more than murders of black teens .
So is it time to panic , or at least to take dramatic action ?
If you look at The New York Times graphic accompanying the story , it sure seems that way .
When the data are displayed differently , you likely come to a different conclusion .
Here is Figure 4 from the James Alan Fox report :
This figure presents homicide rates by age for blacks from 1976 to 2007 .
The dominant pattern in this picture is the huge spike in black youth homicides in the early 1990’s .
The phenomenon captured in the scary New York Times graphic above corresponds to the barely perceptible rise in the black circles at the far right of the figure .
Why do things look so different in The New York Times graphic versus the figure from Fox ’s own report ?
1 ) Compared to the early 1990 ’s , what is happening now is much smaller in scale .
2 ) When put side - by - side with no trend in the homicide rates of blacks aged 18 to 24 ( the gray circles in the graph ) , the blip by 14 - to 17 - year - olds does n’t seem so frightening .
And the most important ( and I would say devious ) difference between the two figures :
3 ) The numbers in The New York Times graphic and most of the James Alan Fox report fail to control for the change in the population of young black males over this time period .
According to U.S. Census data , the number of blacks aged 15 to 19 rose by about 15 percent between 2000 and 2007 .
So even if any individual black teen ’s propensity for crime was unchanged over this time period , the aggregate amount of black - teen crime would have risen by 15 percent .
In other words , in that New York Times graphic on perpetrators , just based on changes in population , the number of perpetrators would have been expected to rise from a little over 800 to nearly 1,000 .
Knowing that , the actual rise to roughly 1,150 does n’t seem that noteworthy .
In his report , James Alan Fox argues for the “ importance of restoring federal funds for crime prevention and crime control . ”
While I suspect that directing federal money toward crime control would be a better use of funds than continued bailouts , I would argue that it is time to experiment with something more radical that would actually save the government an enormous amount of money : ending the war on drugs .
More on that soon .

Hard - up Nasa sounds out potential US buyers for two of three remaining shuttles when they stop flying in 2010
It could be the ultimate Christmas present for anyone who can afford the stellar price tag : Nasa has announced plans to sell off its space shuttles when they stop flying in 2010 , at a cost of at least $ 42 m ( £ 27 m ) apiece – postage and packing included .
Selling its remaining shuttles would bring in much - needed dollars to the hard - up American space agency , which is already facing a budget deficit for the next - generation Ares rockets that it is planned will return astronauts to the moon .
The advertised price is just the starting figure for any one of the orbiters Discovery , Atlantis or Endeavour , which between them have flown 86 missions into space since 1984 .
Included is the minimum $ 6 m cost of stripping a shuttle of toxic and other hazardous materials , preparing it for travel and flying it to an airport of the buyer 's choosing .
As an agency of the US government , Nasa insists it wo n't be selling its most prized assets to just anybody .
So far , it is approaching only educational institutions , science museums and " other appropriate organisations " to gauge interest and assess the size of their chequebooks .
" Nasa is keenly aware of the essential value of these key assets to the space programme 's rich history , " an official says in a " request for information " document that seeks ideas for the public display of the shuttles after their retirement .
" The agency is therefore committed to making placement decisions that are determined to be in the best interest of the American taxpayer .
Special attention will be paid to ensuring they will retire to appropriate places . "
Only US citizens will be eligible to purchase and display the shuttles , which will be sold with all space - worthy fittings and fixtures except the main engines .
Interested parties must promise to display the spacecraft in a climate - controlled indoor location .
Six main shuttle engines will be available for separate purchase for up to $ 800,000 each , excluding transport costs .
Previously , Nasa has donated historically important space hardware for free .
Saturn rockets , lunar modules and other artifacts from the Apollo era are on display at various locations including the Kennedy Space Centre , in Florida , the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum , in Washington DC , and the US Space and Rocket Centre , in Alabama .
Only two of the shuttles are likely to be sold , with the third expected to remain in government hands , possibly on display in Washington .
" Nasa advised Congress that it would begin discussions with the Smithsonian Institution regarding accession of a flown orbiter to the national collection , " the agency said in the document .
The idea is to " gauge the level and scope of interest of US organisations in acquiring the two other orbiters for public display once Nasa 's programmatic requirements for the assets have been satisfied . "
Nasa 's own visitor centres , in Houston and at the Kennedy Space Centre , where all 124 shuttle launches to date have taken place , are among those invited to respond .
Five shuttles have flown into space since the programme began in 1981 .

A yob who killed a bus passenger during a row about his swearing has been jailed for just 27 months .
Gary Robson , 23 , shoved 60 - year - old Stanley Dixon off the bus after he challenged him about his language .
Mr Dixon hit his head on a pavement and died in hospital four days later .
The drunken thug lunged at Mr Dixon after his partner , Anne Fisher , challenged Robson over the way he was speaking to his own girlfriend .
Her complaints were met with a barrage of insults and abuse , prompting Mr Dixon to stick up for her .
Newcastle Crown Court heard Mr Dixon and Mrs Fisher had been travelling home to Peterlee from a night out in Hartlepool when Robson and his pals got onto the same bus .
Prosecutor Ewan Duff said : ' Anne Fisher had remonstrated with the defendant for using foul language and being abusive on a public service bus late in the evening .
' The remonstration by Mrs Fisher led to the defendant then being abusive to her and in turn led to Mr Dixon intervening in an attempt to stop that abuse .
' The incident ended with the defendant pushing Mr Dixon from the bus on which they all had been travelling so that he fell back from the bus , struck his head on the pavement and from which he sustained fatal injuries from which he died . '
Fellow passengers had also been insulted and forced to change seats to get away from Robson and his friends during the journey .
One elderly lady had said Robson in particular was using foul language .
' Every other word he used was the " F " word , it was upsetting to all , ' she told police .
The court heard it was when Robson , who was celebrating landing a new sales job , had turned his anger and aggression towards his own girlfriend , that Mrs Fisher decided to speak out .
' It seems to have been the abuse from the defendant towards his own girlfriend that caused Mrs Fisher to intevene , ' Mr Duff said .
' What she did was to turn and ask the defendant to stop swearing as there were young girls on the bus .
' The response of the defendant when Mrs Fisher asked them to stop was to say something to her like " what the f**** has it got to do with you " or " shut the f*** up and mind your own business " . '
The court heard it was at this point Mr Dixon , a divorced father - of - three with a history of heart trouble , stepped in to defend his partner , but was also met with abuse .
Mr Duff added : ' The general picture is of the defendant being aggressive towards Mr DIxon and indeed attempting to hit him on a number of occasions . '
Even Robson 's girlfriend and his friend were trying to pull him back from Mr Dixon and Mrs Fisher , who had already decided to leave the bus .
It was as they stopped to give the driver , who was calling the police , their names and addresses that the fatal clash occurred .
Mr Duff said : ' Mrs Fisher saw the defendant coming from the back of the bus and she feared he was going to attack Mr Dixon so she attempted to bar his way .
' She was struck in the face by the defendant , her glasses were knocked sideways and the defendant was able to get past her .
' Mr Dixon was posing no threat at all to the defendant and the defendant made a very determined effort to get to him , knocking Mrs Fisher aside , forcing his way past her and quite deliberately pushing Mr Dixon forcefully in the chest . '
Mr Dixon was taken to Sunderland Royal Hospital and later transfered to a specialist at Newcastle General but was pronounced dead on July 2 .
The court heard Mr Dixon , who divorced the mother of his three children in 1999 , had met Mrs Fisher , who has one daughter , in 2002 .
After the attack Robson went home and bought himself a pizza before being arrested by police the next day .
Defence barrister Richard Bloomfield said Robson , who had previously been in the armed forces , was genuinely sorry for what he did .
Mr Bloomfield said ;
' He will always have to carry with him the knowledge he was responsible for the responsible for the death of another person , all be it unintended .
' He carries that with him and does appear to be genuinely remorseful for what he has done . '
Judge David Hodson jailed Robson for 27 months .
The judge said : ' It is well recognised that these cases are among the most difficult that any court has to deal with .
' Mrs Fisher 's victim impact statement speaks of the devastation that Mr Dixon 's death has caused her and how her life will never be the same again .
' No court can ever restore Stanley Dixon to his family , no sentence can ever match their dreadful loss , no sentence of the defendant can ever equate to the sentence the family will have to endure , that will last forever .
' The court must have in mind the unlawful act was done without any intention to kill or cause really serious harm .
' Of course the result was Mr Dixon 's death , but I accept that was not your intention . '
Robson , of Peterlee , County Durham , admitted manslaugher at an earlier hearing .
Perspective view of a mountain in the eastern Hellas region of Mars surrounded by a deposit that scientists think are debris - covered glaciers .
Image is 20 miles ( 31 km ) across .
Mars has vast glaciers hidden under aprons of rocky debris near mid-latitude mountains , a new study confirms , pointing to a new and large potential reservoir of life - supporting water on the planet .
These mounds of ice exist at much lower latitudes than any ice previously found on the red planet .
" Altogether , these glaciers almost certainly represent the largest reservoir of water ice on Mars that 's not in the polar caps , " said John Holt of the University of Texas at Austin and the main author of the study .
" Just one of the features we examined is three times larger than the city of Los Angeles and up to one - half - mile thick , and there are many more . "
The gently sloping mid-latitude debris flows have puzzled scientists since they were revealed by NASA 's Viking orbiters in the 1970s — they looked very different than the fans and cones of debris found near mountains and cliffs in Mars ' equatorial regions .
Since their discovery , scientists have been debating how the features formed , with some proposing they were debris flows lubricated by ice that had since evaporated away .
But more recent observations suggested that the features " might be more ice than rock , " Holt said .
In other words , they could be Martian glaciers .
Holt and his colleagues used radar observations of the features , taken by NASA 's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter ( MRO ) , to peer into the features .
The findings , detailed in the Nov. 21 issue of the journal Science , suggest that the glacier theory is correct .
Finding huge deposits of ice at the Martian mid-latitudes is a boon to both the study of past potential Martian habitability , as well as future human exploration .
Glaciers are huge reservoirs of water once they melt , key to all life as we know it .
Radar echoes
The team used MRO 's Shallow Radar instrument to penetrate the rocky debris flows that lie in the Hellas Basin region of Mars ' southern hemisphere .
They examined the radar echoes to see what lay beneath the surface .
All signs pointed to ice , and lots of it .
The radar echoes received back by MRO indicated that radio waves passed through the overlying debris material and reflected off a deeper surface below without losing much strength — the expected signal for thick ice covered by a thin layer of debris .
The radar echoes also showed no signs of significant rock debris within the glaciers , suggesting that they are relatively pure water ice .
" These results are the smoking gun pointing to the presence of large amounts of water ice at these latitudes , " said Ali Safaeinili , a Shallow Rader team member at NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , Calif .
How old ?
The sheer amount of ice present in the flows studied was surprising ; extrapolating from the Hellas Basin feature to the many others present in both Martian hemispheres , there seems to be a lot of ice hiding under the Martian surface .
The researchers estimate that the amount of ice in these mid-latitude glaciers is about 1 percent of the ice that 's in Mars ' polar caps — roughly equivalent to the ratio of Earth 's non-polar glaciers to its polar ice , Holt told SPACE.com .
The glaciers could hold as much as 10 percent of the ice in the polar caps , similar to comparing Greenland 's ice sheets to Antarctica , Holt added .
But just how the ice got there is still a mystery .
" You should n't have ice of this quantity at these latitudes , " Holt said .
The theory is that the ice formed when Mars ' orbital tilt was much different than it is now ( the axis the planet spins on has considerable " wobble , " meaning its angle changes over time ) and the planet was much colder , allowing ice to form on the surface .
Ice on the surface of Mars today would immediately sublimate ( or change directly into the gas phase ) .
The rocky debris covering the ice is likely what keeps it in place today and has allowed it to survive below the surface for millions of years .
Scientists are n't exactly sure during which past ice age the glaciers may have formed , but by counting the number of impact craters in the overlying debris , they estimate them to be about 100 million years old , said study team member Jim Head of Brown University in Providence , R.I .
Water source
These ancient glaciers could hold clues that would shed more light on Mars ' past , particularly whether or not it ever harbored life .
" On Earth , " Head said , " such buried glacial ice in Antarctica preserves the record of traces of ancient organisms and past climate history . "
Ancient ice layers in glaciers on Earth preserve the signature of the current atmosphere at the time that they formed .
Head thinks the same could be true of the Martian glaciers .
In particular , small bubbles that form as the ice layers are deposited could have " samples of the atmosphere at that time , " he said .
A lander capable of drilling down several meters could be able to sample the ice in the glaciers .
" These are quite accessible to landers , " Holt said .
They could also be a source of water for any future manned Mars expeditions .
( When the researchers travel to Antarctica , for instance , they simply knock off chunks of ice and melt them instead of lugging water with them . )
" It 's a lot of ice , " Holt said .
" You could support a base for a long time . "
agreed , stunning .

LONDON ( Reuters ) -
Next year is set to be one of the top - five warmest on record , British climate scientists said on Tuesday .

The average global temperature for 2009 is expected to be more than 0.4 degrees celsius above the long - term average , despite the continued cooling of huge areas of the Pacific Ocean , a phenomenon known as La Nina .
That would make it the warmest year since 2005 , according to researchers at the Met Office , who say there is also a growing probability of record temperatures after next year .
Currently the warmest year on record is 1998 , which saw average temperatures of 14.52 degrees celsius - well above the 1961 - 1990 long - term average of 14 degrees celsius .
Warm weather that year was strongly influenced by El Nino , an abnormal warming of surface ocean waters in the eastern tropical Pacific .
Theories abound as to what triggers the mechanisms that cause an El Nino or La Nina event but scientists agree that they are playing an increasingly important role in global weather patterns .
The strength of the prevailing trade winds that blow from east to west across the equatorial Pacific is thought to be an important factor .
“ Further warming to record levels is likely once a moderate El Nino develops , ” said Professor Chris Folland at the Met Office Hadley Center .
“ Phenomena such as El Nino and La Nina have a significant influence on global surface temperature . ”
Professor Phil Jones , director of the climate research unit at the University of East Anglia , said global warming had not gone away despite the fact that 2009 , like the year just gone , would not break records .
“ What matters is the underlying rate of warming , ” he said .
He noted the average temperature over 2001 - 2007 was 14.44 degrees celsius , 0.21 degrees celsius warmer than corresponding values for 1991 - 2000 .
Less clear , however , is whether Mr. Burg has provided any serious answers .
This is partly because his book and discourse vacillate between two poles : congratulating Jews and the Zionist movement for their success so far , but warning them that they are turning into a kind of self - justifying Sparta , a warlike state on the verge of tragedy .
His central point is summed up in the English title of his book : “ The Holocaust Is Over ; We Must Rise From Its Ashes ” ( Palgrave Macmillan ) .
The Nazi slaughter of six million Jews , he says , has become the central theme of Israeli life , dominating it in a way that distorts the country ’s outlook .
Teenagers are sent on trips to Auschwitz ; every enemy of Israel ( Yasir Arafat , the Palestinian leader ; Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , the president of Iran ) is viewed as the reincarnation of Hitler .
MR. BURG has shifted the title of his book over the years .
When he was writing it , he called it “ Hitler Won . ”
When he published it in Hebrew he called it “ Defeating Hitler . ”
Partly , he said in the interview , his thinking is evolving , and partly his American editors made some smart cuts and suggestions .
But it also seems clear that he has modified and adjusted his arguments , especially for a foreign audience .
The English version does not have some of his more alarming assertions in the Hebrew one  for example , that the Israeli government would probably soon pass the equivalent of the Nuremberg laws , with provisions like a prohibition on marriage between Jews and Arabs .
Asked what precipitated his initial shift from mainstream public figure to more marginal public scourge , Mr. Burg pointed to a process that began in 2001 when he ran for leadership of the Labor Party and lost in a tight race that he says was stolen from him through back - room deals .
It was not so much the loss , he asserted , as the realization that he had poured his heart and soul into trying to win something that he had thought so little about .
“ I knew how to get elected , but what was I going to do once I got there ? ” he recalled thinking .
Maybe , he felt , it was lucky that he lost .
Iceland ’s banking collapse is the biggest , relative to the size of an economy , that any country has ever suffered .
There are lessons to be learnt beyond its shores
AP
ATOP a hill near Reykjavik 's old harbour is a bronze statue of Ingolfur Arnarson , the first Nordic settler of inhospitable Iceland .
It overlooks a bunker - like building : the central bank , headed by David Oddsson , a man who more than 1,100 years later has shown similar survival skills .
Before chairing the central bank 's board of governors , Mr Oddsson was prime minister for more than 13 years , a record , during which time Iceland became one of the richest countries in the world .
For years he was Iceland 's most popular politician , privatising most of the banking system with a Thatcherite zeal and floating the currency , the krona .
But the collapse of the krona and nationalisation of the country 's three largest banks in early October , which forced the country to secure help from the IMF , have left Iceland 's economic miracle and Mr Oddsson 's reputation in tatters .
For weeks , protesters have gathered in Reykjavik 's main square each Saturday calling for his removal from office .
On the chilly afternoon of December 1st a few hundred of them , shouting “ David out , David out ” , gathered at the Arnarson statue and marched down the hill to the central bank .
In the lobby , they were met by riot police , who eventually defused the situation .
Such protests are almost unheard of : the only previous mass demonstrations to shake the country , against NATO membership , took place in 1949 .
But the economic crisis has exposed deep fissures in the nation of 300,000 people .
In the same building the next day , Mr Oddsson barely smiles when he tells The Economist , “ They say that the only way to get to paradise without dying is to be governor of a central bank .
This has not been true in Iceland . ”
So far , such protests are the most tangible evidence of the troubles besetting Icelandic society .
The landscape bears scars too .
From the central bank , the view of snow - dusted Mount Esja across the estuary is blocked by a half - finished grey edifice , sprawled like a dead whale across the harbour - front .
This was to have been Iceland 's most spectacular building , crowning 15 years of economic growth : a concert hall facing out to the North Atlantic , covered in glass prisms imported from China meant to resemble glaciers and lava .
But since the collapse of the bank that led the funding , construction has almost ground to a halt .
Likewise , blocks of half - built luxury flats stand half - finished along the waterfront .
Instead of glass prisms , Icelanders are looking forward to a different Chinese cargo in the dying weeks of the year : fireworks .
They set off more per person each new year than any other country in the world .
Such is the demand that the Chinese manufacturers are making a special loan to Icelanders to buy them , according to a local newspaper .
Almost no other private creditor is lending them anything ; Iceland has turned instead to the IMF .
In November the fund agreed to a $ 2.1 billion two - year standby programme , which was supplemented by promises from Nordic countries and Poland , as well as Britain , the Netherlands and Germany .
The package will be worth $ 10.2 billion in total — more than half of Iceland 's GDP .
The IMF calls the collapse of the banks the biggest banking failure in history relative to the size of an economy .
In 2007 Iceland 's three main banks made loans equivalent to about nine times the size of the booming economy , up from about 200 % of GDP after privatisation in 2003 ( see chart 1 ) .
Only about one - fifth of those loans were in kronur ; interest rates on these were punitively high .
Ordinary citizens instead borrowed from their banks in cheaper currencies such as yen and Swiss francs to buy even the most modest homes and cars .
But after the banks collapsed in early October , the currency slumped and domestic interest rates rose sharply ( see chart 2 ) .
Exchange controls imposed in the heat of the crisis have severely restricted access to hard currency .
Initially , there were fears for the payments system .
But after an initial panic , credit and debit cards appear to work normally again ; Reykjavik 's stores are filled with Christmas shoppers , and restaurants still serve up expensive delicacies such as grilled whale .
But people are mostly living on borrowed time as well as borrowed money .
The IMF programme forecasts that the economy will contract by 9.6 % next year .
Many workers have been laid off but , thanks to Iceland 's labour laws , they have three months ' notice , so the impact is not yet being fully felt .
Many young Icelanders , who have never known unemployment , are expected to lose their jobs as businesses shut down .
Vilhjalmur Egilsson , head of the Confederation of Icelandic Employers , the main business organisation , says that “ corporate Iceland is technically bankrupt ” because of its foreign debts .
It is unable to refinance loans because the new capital controls mean all credit to the country has dried up .
With unemployment rising , citizens talk openly about defaulting on their home and car loans ( those flashy Range Rovers are now known dryly as “ Game Overs ” ) .
Principal payments on local - currency mortgages are indexed to inflation , which is expected to be 20 % this year .
Because of this and their foreign - currency exposure , many households ' debts have doubled in krona terms .
Sirry Hjaltested , a pre-school teacher who joins in the Saturday protests , says that her grocery bills have gone up by half in a few months .
She blames the country 's reckless bankers for the ruin of the economy .
“ If I met a banker , ” she says , “ I 'd kick his ass so hard , my shoes would be stuck inside . ”
The scale of what confronts Ms Hjaltested and other Icelanders is only just becoming clear .
According to the IMF , the failure of the banks may cost taxpayers more than 80 % of GDP .
Relative to the economy 's size , that would be about 20 times what the Swedish government paid to rescue its banks in the early 1990s .
It would be several times the cost of Japan 's banking crisis a decade ago .
Abroad , there are also stark lessons from Iceland 's woes .
There may also be important consequences for cross - border banking regulation all over Europe .
Iceland 's tale exemplifies why central banks around the world are spraying liquidity at the financial system to keep banks in business .
When liquidity vanishes , banks quickly become insolvent .
When that happens to foreign - currency loans and deposits , the central bank 's abilities as lender of last resort are tested , and Iceland shows how quickly a small country with a thinly traded currency can fail that test .
Iceland was uniquely overextended , but other countries , too , have big banking industries relative to the size of their economies supported by lots of borrowing .
Britain is one .
Willem Buiter of the London School of Economics , who prepared a report on Iceland earlier this year that gave warning of the risk of disaster , asked in a recent , widely discussed blog whether London could be “ Reykjavik - on - Thames ” .
A geyser under London
The balance - sheet of Britain 's banking system , at 450 % of GDP , was half the ( relative ) size of Iceland 's at the end of last year .
But that is still high .
Like Iceland , Britain does not have a global reserve currency , such as the dollar or the euro , to draw on if it needs to act as lender of last resort .
Its net foreign - exchange exposure is nil , but Iceland was in a similar position , and its banks have not been able to liquidate foreign assets to cover their foreign debts .
Mr Buiter acknowledges that Britain has access to currency swap lines from the world 's biggest central banks , which would help it prevent a run on the banks .
But he argues that the cost of this insurance will make London less competitive as a global financial centre .
He thinks this makes a good case for Britain to adopt the euro .
Among larger European countries , he says , the British government 's exposure to its banking sector is by far the highest .
“ Switzerland , Denmark and Sweden are in a similar pickle , ” he adds .
Iceland found , to its peril , that its access to the leading currencies was not as sure as it had hoped .
In fact , as troubles mounted , it succeeded only in securing swap lines worth € 1.5 billion ( $ 2.3 billion ) from three Nordic central banks in May , hardly enough to prevent a run on its banks .
The Federal Reserve , the European Central Bank ( ECB ) and the Bank of England all rejected Iceland 's requests , stating , according to the Central Bank of Iceland , that the Icelandic financial system was too large relative to the size of the economy for plausible swap lines to be effective .
They also wanted Iceland to talk to the IMF , which the authorities appear to have done only half - heartedly at first .
Why were the foreigners so tight - fisted ?
A big problem was the increasingly rickety business model of Iceland 's two largest banks , Landsbanki and Kaupthing Bank .
Because Iceland is so small , the banks could attract only paltry sums in domestic deposits , which made them overly reliant on international capital markets .
But in 2006 , in what one of their chief executives describes as a stroke of genius , they hit upon the idea of creating internet accounts to attract foreign deposits , using the cost savings from online banking to offer higher interest rates to savers .
Their strategy was so successful that soon they were sucking deposits away from bricks - and - mortar banks across Europe .
Financial officials in several countries say it became clear early this year that these online banks might pose a systemic threat across the region .
Landsbanki , for example , had used Iceland 's membership of the European Economic Area ( which gives countries access to the European single market without having to join the European Union ) to develop its online banking presence .
Under the EEA 's “ passport ” system , it could set up bank branches abroad that were supervised from Reykjavik , notably its internet operations in Britain and the Netherlands , called Icesave .
But as Icesave grew , European authorities realised that Iceland 's coffers were far too small to provide deposit insurance to savers , and that its central bank lacked reserves to act as a credible lender of last resort in the case of a run .
The British authorities pressed Landsbanki to create a subsidiary in London that would be supervised by British banking authorities , as its compatriot , Kaupthing , had done .
It never did .
When Landsbanki collapsed in October , the country ended up owing $ 8.2 billion to foreign internet depositors of its banks , an amount almost half the size of Iceland 's entire economy .
At the time , other big cross - border banks , such as Fortis , a Benelux bank , and Dexia , a Belgo - Dutch bank , were in deep trouble , and there were growing concerns among European officials that a country could be overwhelmed if it was home to a big international bank that failed .
Landsbanki made this fear into reality .
Partly as a result of the Iceland fiasco , the British government has written to the European Commission seeking urgent consideration of improvements to legislation of cross - border banking in the EEA , including better ways of protecting depositors in branches of foreign banks .
Forever in your debt
In Iceland there are still many misgivings about repaying the huge debts incurred , as there are about other aspects of the IMF programme .
A report in Morgunbladid , a national newspaper , claimed that relative to Iceland 's size , the debt to Icesave depositors is bigger than the reparations demanded of Germany by the Treaty of Versailles .
Mr Egilsson of the employers ' confederation has written to the IMF 's local boss in Iceland urging him to scrap what he describes as ruinous capital controls .
In his unassuming whitewashed offices near the central bank , Geir Haarde , the prime minister , appears sympathetic to some of these concerns .
“ There is still a lot of legal argumentation saying we should not pay ” the debt to Icesave depositors , he says , though he stresses that his government has agreed to reimburse them .
Bloomberg News
Oddsson loses his grip
He suggests that the government also thought long and hard before turning to the IMF .
Already the country is chafing under interest rates that were pushed up by six percentage points to 18 % during talks with the fund .
“ The interest - rate policy is probably the most difficult part for Icelanders to accept and understand , ” he says .
He hopes that rates will start to fall quite quickly early next year , but knows the IMF is concerned about a premature relaxation of monetary policy .
“ We will need to do it in a very careful way .
[ But ] we have had high interest rates here for a long time and people are tired of them . ”
The status of the nationalised banks is another sore point .
After being seized by the government ( Kaupthing was given an unhelpful shove into bankruptcy when the British government put its London subsidiary into administration ) , they have defaulted on their huge international liabilities .
These have been placed into “ old banks ” , while local - currency deposits and loans are in “ new banks ” that are meant to restore a semblance of normality to Iceland 's financial system .
However , even the new banks have written off about 50 % of their loans , implying that they do not expect that portion to be repaid .
With interest rates as high as they are , and principal payments indexed to inflation , Jon Jonsson , an Icelandic international banker , says the solvency of even the new banks remains in doubt .
Mr Haarde says one possible solution is to hand the banks over to their biggest foreign creditors .
Talks are under way with some , such as Germany 's Bayerische Landesbank , he says .
( On December 1st the German bank announced huge job cuts and said it would receive about € 30 billion of state support , partly because of its losses in Iceland .
It is not keen to take over an Icelandic bank . )
The key to stabilising Iceland will be the currency , and here the responsibility falls most heavily on Mr Oddsson .
In recent days the krona has shot up in value against the euro , partly because the central bank has eased the controls on inflows of foreign exchange .
But capital outflows are still restricted and there are growing fears among business people that the capital controls will drive the last vestiges of foreign investment out of Iceland .
It is also clear , however , that lifting the controls too quickly may lead to huge capital flight .
Mr Oddsson makes little attempt to conceal his disquiet over these matters .
Capital controls are “ not a line taken from the Bible , ” he says .
“ They were the recommendation of the IMF .
It was the government 's call and after it was done we supported it . ”
That hardly amounts to a ringing endorsement .
The currency is also where the politics of the crisis are likely to prove most troublesome .
It is not just left - wing agitators who blame Mr Oddsson for the crisis .
( Ever the politician , he expresses sympathy , saying the protests “ describe a huge disappointment of the people ” . )
He has regularly tussled with members of the country 's business elite and the large parts of the media that are owned by Baugur , Iceland 's most prominent international firm .
In an impassioned speech to Iceland 's Chamber of Commerce last month , he urged the police to investigate the activities of bank executives .
One Icelandic firm had debts of 1 trillion kronur ( $ 5.3 billion ) to the three big domestic banks , more than all the banks ' equity combined , he said .
“ The Central Bank of Iceland should probably place dead last on the list of those in need of investigation , ” he declared .
The bankers , in turn , blame him for almost everything , especially the blundered rescue of Glitnir , the smallest of the three banks , in late September , which turned a private - banking crisis into a sovereign - debt one .
He has been criticised for his handling of the overvaluation of the krona , which caused all manner of unhealthy speculation .
He is also accused of overlooking the inadequacy of the central bank 's lender - of - last - resort facility .
An answer across the sea
Whatever the merits of these arguments , the blame game complicates a debate which some consider crucial to Iceland 's attempts to escape from its crisis : a move towards adopting a hard currency , specifically the euro .
The nationalistic Mr Oddsson , who has spent his working life in Reykjavik , is thought to be against this .
( He dismisses the euro zone as a “ Shangri - La ” . )
Iceland 's international business people , buoyed by the arguments of academics such as Mr Buiter , believe that the crisis has exposed the dangers of relying on a small , fragile currency .
It would not be an easy decision .
Iceland has kept out of the EU , not least to safeguard its cod-fishing quotas .
The ECB has made clear that Iceland cannot adopt the euro unless it joins the EU first , which might take years .
Some academics suggest unilateral “ euroisation ” , as Montenegro has done .
This could be done with as little as € 100 m to replace notes in circulation , a fraction of Iceland 's € 3 billion of international reserves .
But such a unilateral step runs the risk of antagonising the EU .
And it might not stop capital flight .
The Independence Party , which Mr Oddsson long led , has brought forward its national convention to January to discuss these matters , but it is divided on the issue .
With the krona on life support , cool heads will be needed to stop the debate splitting the country .
Mr Jonsson , the banker , believes the euro question could be as significant , in its way , as Iceland 's decision to adopt Christianity and throw out its pagan gods 1,000 years ago .
If the krona finally goes the way of the pagans , there is a good chance that Mr Oddsson will go with it .
Plasma Technology Turns Trash into Gas
November 10th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
An Atlanta , GA - based company called Geoplasma is using trash to provide power to 50,000 homes in Florida .
The company ’s plasma refuse plant , which should be online by 2011 , is a first for the United States .
It will process 1,500 tons of garbage each day and send 60 MW of power to the grid .
Geoplasma ’s technology works by blasting garbage with a stream of plasma ( superheated gas ) .
The trash is vaporized into pressurized gas that spins a turbine to create electricity .
Plasma garbage disposal has a number of advantages — emissions are lower than with normal incineration , and it reduces both methane release and landfill volume .
Additionally , power prices are projected to be the same as with electricity generated from natural gas .
Many small plasma plants already exist in other parts of the world , so expect Geoplasma ’s inaugural US plant to be the first of many .

Only the biggest spider on earth , this plate - sized bird - gnawing beast actually prefers to feast on smaller fare , like bats , bugs , and annoying children .
In other words , the bird - eating spider rarely eats birds .
Sure .

Here , human human human human .
Good human !
The whistling spider is able to emit a distinctive whistle by rubbing its legs together .
What , you thought spiders had lips ?
How else would they whistle !
It ’s a vital part of its native ecosystem and while it is not critically endangered , habitat destruction puts this important species at risk .
Chinese Giant Salamander

Something tells us these giant salamanders were never called for in any witch ’s recipe .
Seriously , look at that thing !
That lives under some people ’s porches !
The United States is also home to a giant salamander called the Hellbender , and it ’s …well , the name fits .
However , it is not as endangered as the shockingly strange - looking Chinese cousin .
The Chinese giant salamander can grow to be nearly six feet long .
Lord Howe Island Stick Insect
Delightfully crisp !
Kidding , kidding .
There are hundreds of stick insects , but the Lord Howe Island stick insect is by far the most critically endangered of all of them .
It can grow to five inches in length ; but do n’t worry , it ’s not poisonous .
Just crunchy .
Weta

Think of this cheery critter as you would a common mouse : not terribly enjoyable to have underfoot , but vital to the ecosystem all the same .
The weta is native to New Zealand and while it ’s something of an icon thanks to Peter Jackson , non-native species , pest eradication and general ugliness ( which really ca n’t be helped now , can it ? ) have all contributed to the sad plight of the weta .
There are actually over 70 species of weta , with 16 being endangered or at risk .
The giant weta was thought to be extinct , but a new population was recently found .
They are n’t the cutest bugs around , but they are harmless and besides , they put up with your mug , do n’t they ?
Giant Water Bug
The inspiration for Alien ?
The palm - sized giant water bug possesses a syringe - like tooth that bores into its prey , injects a toxic venom that liquefies the animal ’s insides , and then …meat ’s back on the menu !
One of the favorite treats of Giant Water Bugs that live in the Amazon is the piranha .
If that tells you anything .
Why would we want something so bad ass to go extinct ?
It ’s not like other animals are waiting around to eat piranhas .
Frigate Island Beetle
( Image via Endangered Ugly )
Put anything in a place where it ’s hot and wet 99 % of the time , and it will grow .
Whether it ’s a fern , a vine or a dear - Jeebus - that ’s - horrifying beetle , things just come bigger in the tropics .
The seriously endangered and geographically unique Frigate Island Beetle is no exception .
It ’s the largest of the tenebrionid beetles and the most at risk .
If you ever leave the internet long enough to visit Frigate Island and you pick up a beetle and it stains your hands and clothes with a “ musky ” scented purple ink , put that little guy somewhere safe !
You ’ve just happened upon a Frigate Island beetle .
Giant Palouse Earthworm
( Image via ecoscraps )
At lengths of up to one foot , the Giant Palouse is the largest earthworm on earth .
It ’s quite harmless , but unfortunately it ’s endangered all the same .
It lives in Eastern Washington State and Idaho and was thought to be extinct until 2005 , when a student discovered a living specimen .
Previous sightings had n’t happened since the 1980s .
Part of the reason it ’s so hard to find the Giant Palouse ?
They burrow 15 feet into the ground .
Giant Coconut Crab
( Image via kottke )
This is not shopped .
This is not a hoax .
That is a giant crab on a garbage can .
They ’re native to Guam and other Pacific islands .
Coconut crabs are n’t endangered , per se , but due to tropical habitat destruction they are at risk .
In WWII , American soldiers stationed in the Pacific theater wrote home with tales about entire atolls being covered in the armor - plated giants .
These crabs can crack a coconut in one swipe ; but they ’re generally too slow to be very dangerous to humans .
Children pass lazy afternoons by picking the crabs off tree trunks and watching them crash to the ground ; it ’s reportedly great fun .
And kind of messed up .
Crinoid Snapping Shrimp
( Image via divegallery )
The tiny Crinoid snapping shrimp is the tiniest of all the snapping shrimp , and the only one that is endangered .
The snapping shrimp is often called the pistol shrimp because it comes with its very own “ gun ” by which it makes a loud cracking , shooting noise .
It really only shoots air , but the stun gun is enough to knock out prey foolish enough to swim past .
Honduran Ghost Bat
( Image via wonderful world of animals )
The Honduran ghost bat is not officially endangered , but many American ecologists consider it to be threatened due to rainforest habitat destruction and climate change .
It is unique , both for its tiny size ( just a few centimeters ) and its pale coloring .
Mallorcan Midwife Toad
( Image via arkive )
The Mallorcan Midwife toad …is a dude .
In a gender - bender twist that seems to occur a lot in the frog world , this toad swaps child - bearing and child - rearing duties .
The father serves as a surrogate for the tots until they hatch , and even cares for them after .
Mom , meanwhile , hunts and generally stays out partying every night .
Females will even compete with each other for mating rights , much like males of other animal species .
Quacking Frog
( Image via liquidghoul )
The quacking frog makes a sound that is just like a small duck .
Go on , listen !
Unfortunately , like many frogs , the quacking frog is endangered .
Scientist are particularly concerned when frogs disappear or show signs of stress , because frogs are considered indicator species .
Glass Frog
The glass frog is endangered , as well .
And absolutely stunning , so it would be a shame if we let it die out .
Note the visible organs in this beautiful specimen .
Unfortunately , with tropical rainforests in Central and South America threatened ( in some places , the problem is actually worse than it was in previous decades ) , the glass frog may go extinct .
More Legless Amphibians : the Icthyophis Kohtaoensis
( Image via Berkeley )
There are actually a number of legless amphibians , but some of the strangest ones have tentacles sprouting from their heads .
They ’re known as caecilians , and some of them have some really unusual physical adaptations for a number of functions ( the Mexican Walking Fish at the top of this post is just one ) .
One caecilian has a protruding tail - like limb that enables external fertilization , for example .
Though they look like soft worms , they have rows of very sharp teeth .
There are over 120 species of caecilians around the world that have been discovered so far , but many of them are endangered and we do n’t know much about them .
Komodo Dragon
( Image source )
Threatened by both volcanoes and humans , this fascinating prehistoric relic is endangered .
At 10 feet and 330 pounds , it is the largest lizard in existence .
They have poor hearing and cannot run very fast for very long , instead relying on their sharp eyesight and powers of stealth to hunt .
It possesses serrated teeth and has nasty attack habits , preferring to jab at the feet or drag its prey along for a bit before finishing off the deed .
If an animal is lucky enough to get away , it will soon die from massive infection thanks to the komodo ’s specialized bacteria .
Komodos will eat nearly anything , living or dead , including their own young .
Unlike the great cats , they will also eat nearly all of their kill , even the intestines , although they do swing those around to expel the feces first as they really do n’t like excrement .
For this reason , baby komodos roll themselves in feces to avoid being eaten .
Kagu
( Image via tropical birding )
A rare New Zealand bird , not much is known about the enigmatic Kagu .
It is flightless , though its wings are large ; it is a forest - dweller , though its markings are oddly light in color .
Very few remain and scientists know little about its preferences and habits .
We do know that it possesses “ nasal corns ” unlike any other bird .
For reasons unknown , the kagu also has one - third the red blood count of other birds .
Scientists have had a difficult time classifying this rare and unusual bird .
Hairy Nosed Wombat
Though it looks similar to the standard wombat , the hairy nosed wombat possesses some unique features .
Among the rarest mammals in the world , it has a backwards - opening pouch and is the largest burrowing herbivorous mammal known to humans .
The other oddity of the hairy nosed wombat is that its teeth continue to grow throughout its life – now that ’s long in the tooth !
Striped Rabbit
( Image via University of Alberta )
Only discovered within the last decade , the striped rabbit is considered a bit of a scientific novelty owing to its unusual markings .
It comes from a region of Burma that has revealed many unusual species previously unknown to scientists , including a miniature deer .
Pictures are scarce .
Astoundingly beautiful , and clearly a step up from the first game which is still technically impressive , these screenshots of Uncharted 2 are amazing .

The student who popped out to the shops ... and returned to find he was £ 100 billion overdrawn
Banking mad : Donald Moffat found his Barclays account to be £ 100 billion in the red when he checked online
Donald and Wendy Moffat had only logged on to check they had enough money in the bank to pay for the MoT on the family car .
But when they opened the account online , they saw more noughts than they could put a name to .
According to Barclays , the couple were £ 100 billion overdrawn .
The shortfall had been caused by two £ 50 billion withdrawals , about which , Mr Moffat , a student and part - time care worker , had no knowledge .
The 38 - year - old and his wife , 41 , immediately assumed they had been the victims of some kind of fraud .
' We knew we still had quite a bit left in the account as we checked last night before we went out , ' he said yesterday .
' This morning I went out to get a few things then , when I came back , my account was overdrawn by that amount .
My wife said she had never seen that many numbers on a bank account .
She did not know how to pronounce it never mind anything else .
Happily for the couple , their overdraft turned out to be little more than a technical glitch .
And when the father of two contacted Barclays to flag up his concerns , he was told staff already knew about the problem and were in the process of correcting it .
He was less pleased with the £ 10 compensation they offered .
' I was physically sick with the stress of this , it was affecting my wife and kids – I think it 's ridiculous , ' added Mr Moffat , of Irvine , in Ayrshire , Scotland , who is studying computing at college .
He is hoping the bank will increase its offer of compensation .
In a statement , Barclays said : ' Earlier today a technical error caused some customer accounts to be incorrectly debited .
' The problem was immediately identified and corrected within less than an hour , and all affected customer accounts are now showing correct balances .
' No customers will be financially impacted by this error .
We apologise for any inconvenience this may have caused our customers . '
However , it is not the first time technical glitches at banks have caused distress .
When aerobics instructor Liz Seymour , came home from holiday in 1998 , she found a letter telling her she was £ 121 billion overdrawn .
The TSB branch , in Hull , warned that her interest payments would be £ 2.5 billion a month .
' I nearly fainted .
If I was that much overdrawn , I 'd have stayed on holiday for good , ' said the 24 - year - old .
The bank later apologised for its ' clerical error ' .
Abstracting on , suggested solutions
Explicit type applications
f :: forall a .
a -> a f = \ x -> x b :: Bool b = f True
w
w
f :: forall ( a ::*) . a -> a f = /\ ( a ::*) -> \ ( x ::a ) -> x b :: Bool b = f @Bool True
/\
expr @type
I guess I should be more constructive than just whining about how Haskell does n't always do what I want .
I do have some suggestions on how to fix things .
Let 's look at a simple example again :
The way I like to think of this ( and what happens in ghc ) is that this is shorthand for something more explicit , namely the Fversion of the same thing .
In Fall type abstraction and type application are explicit .
Let 's look at the explicit version ( which is no longer Haskell ) .
I 'm usingfor type abstraction andfor type application .
Furthermore each binder is annotated with its type .
This is what ghc translates the code to internally , this process involves figuring out what all the type abstractions and applications should be .
Not something a little more complicated ( from my previous post )
class C a b where x :: a y :: b f :: ( C a b ) => a -> [ a ] f z = [ x , x , z ]
x
x :: forall a b .
( C a b ) => a
x
f
f :: forall a b .
( C a b ) => a -> [ a ] f = /\ ( a ::*) ( b ::*) -> \ ( z::a) -> [ x @a @b1 , x @a @b2 , z ]
b
b1
b2
The type ofisSo wheneveroccurs two type applications have to be inserted ( there 's also a dictionary to insert , but I 'll ignore that ) .
The decorated term for ( ignoring the context ) The reason for the ambiguity in type checking is that the type check cannot figure out that theis in any way connected toand .
Because it is n't .
And there 's currently no way we can connect them .
So I suggest that it should be possible to use explicit type application in Haskell when you want to .
The code would look like this
f :: forall a b .
( C a b ) => a -> [ a ] f z = [ x @a @b , x @a @b , z ]
forall
Something like abstype
class
Ops t where data XString t :: * (+++ ) :: XString t -> XString t ->
XString t instance Ops Basic where type XString Basic = String (+++ ) = (++)
newtype
newtype
abstype
The order of the variables in thedetermines the order in which the type abstractions come , and thus determines where to put the type applications .
Back to my original problem with abstraction .
What about if this was allowed :
So the class declaration says I 'm going to use data types ( which was my final try and which works very nicely ) .
But in the instance I provide a type synonym instead .
This would be like using ain the instance , but without having to use the newtype constructor everywhere .
The fact that it 's not a real data type is only visible inside the instance declaration .
The compiler could in fact make aand insert all the coercions .
This is , of course , just a variation of thesuggestion by Wehr and Chakravarty .

Functional Programming Unit Testing - Part 6 Saturday , January 10 , 2009
In the last installment in this series , we talked about separating the side effecting code from the pure functions .
I gave examples in both Haskell and F# to accomplish this goal , although with Haskell it ’s more intuitive due to encapsulating the side effects within the IO monad .
This time , let ’s cover how we can abstract the monadic code through the use of type classes .
Using the book , Real World Haskell , has opened up a lot of possibilities in this area .
Refactoring Again
I want to revisit our topic of refactoring that in the last post .
In this post and the next couple of posts , I want to explore additional areas with refactoring including the following :
Keeping Things
Pure – covered last post
Monadic Isolation for Testing
Refactoring with frameworks ( HLint , etc )
In this post , let ’s cover how we can abstract away the side effecting into a pure , controlled environment for testing .
Abstracting Towards Purity
In the Haskell world , there is both a blessing and a curse associated with the IO monad in how powerful it is .
The power comes from helping us avoid purity mistakes , but since there are n’t any grades of IO monads meaning to the level of what it can and cannot do , it could be a source of problems .
Taking an idea from the Real World Haskell book , we can not only tame the IO monad , but as well , hide it so that we could test our functions without actually causing any IO operations to take place .
In order to do this , we could specify a type class with specifies the interface we wish to expose to this monad .
If you ’re not familiar with type classes , it ’s a way that we can specify a set of functions that can have different implementations based upon the type given .
They could be mistaken for generic interfaces in the .NET world , but in fact they are quite different and a bit more powerful .
Let ’s go ahead and define a type class for dealing with database interactions using HDBC and ODBC so that we could abstract away the IO and instead stub our return .
-- file SqlAbstraction.hs
import Control .
Monad
import Database.HDBC
( SqlValue (.. ) )
class Monad m => MonadConnection c m | m -> c where
connectODBC :: String -> m c
quickQuery ' :: c -> String -> [ SqlValue ] -> m [ [ SqlValue ] ]
run :: c -> String -> [ SqlValue ] -> m Integer
commit :: c -> m()
disconnect :: c -> m()
Now that we ’ve defined what is allowed in our monadic abstraction , let ’s stub out what some of these returns might be .
In order to do that , we need a monad that does nothing more than returns the original value , which is the Identity monad .
We can then implement an instance of the Identity monad on top of our abstraction such as the following .
-- file SqlAbstraction.hs
instance MonadConnection String Identity where
connectODBC connString = return connString
quickQuery ' conn cmd params =
return [ [ SqlInteger 1 ] ]
run conn cmd params = return 0
commit conn = return ()
disconnect conn = return ()
Now running our implementation of a given function that uses this monad is simple and would require nothing more than the following and yield a pure value .
ghci > :t runIdentity someFunction -- replace with a real function
runIdentity someFunction :: Bool
ghci > runIdentity someFunction
True
Now that we understand that we can stub out our return values from the monad instance , we could also look at what the real implementation might look like .
-- file SqlAbstraction.hs
import qualified Database .HDBC
import qualified Database .HDBC.ODBC
instance MonadConnection Database.HDBC.ODBC.Connection IO where
connectODBC = Database.HDBC.ODBC .connectODBC
quickQuery ' = Database.HDBC .quickQuery '
run = Database .HDBC
.run
commit = Database.HDBC
.commit
disconnect = Database.HDBC .disconnect
We realize once I run the Identity version that because I ’m getting a pure value with deterministic input based upon my stubs , I could write my tests in either HUnit , the xUnit style of testing , or just as well , I could use QuickCheck to verify the results .
In this instance , I ’ll use HUnit to run through this because my inputs are well defined .
setSchema_ReturnSchema :: Test
setSchema_ReturnSchema =
TestCase $ assertEqual " Should get schema " 1
( runIdentity $ setSchema " testConn " [ " schema_version " ])
setSchema_InsertSchema :: Test
setSchema_InsertSchema =
TestCase $ assertEqual " Should create schema with 0 " 0
( runIdentity $ setSchema " testConn " [ " foobar " ])
setSchema :: MonadConnection c m => c -> [ String ] -> m
Int
setSchema conn tables =
if " schema_version " `elem` tables
then do r <- quickQuery ' conn " SELECT version FROM schema_version " [ ]
case r of
[ [ x ] ] -> return ( fromSql x )
x -> fail $ " Unexpected result in setSchema : " ++ show x
else do run conn " CREATE TABLE schema_version ( version INTEGER ) " [ ]
run conn " INSERT INTO schema_version VALUES ( 0 ) " [ ]
commit conn
return 0
Above is a simple implementation with the tests I defined to flush out the behavior of what setSchema should do .
The two cases define whether I already have a schema version or I do n’t and act appropriately .
I can then run the tests to verify the behavior .
ghci > runTestTT $ TestList [ setSchema_ReturnSchema , setSchema_InsertSchema ]
Cases : 2 Tried : 2 Errors : 0 Failures : 0
Counts {cases = 2 , tried = 2 , errors = 0 , failures = 0}
Not only could we test with stubs , but as well , we can capture which methods are called by logging all calls made to our MonadConnection functions through the use of the Writer monad .
This way , we can determine through examining our log afterwards which functions were called , and which were not .
First , we need to define even operations for all items that we care about .
Then we need to tell the Writer monad how to capture our events .
Let ’s define how we might do that .
-- file SqlAbstraction.hs
import Control .
Monad .
Writer
data Event = Open String
| Query String String [ SqlValue ]
| Run String String [ SqlValue ]
| Commit String
| Disconnect String
deriving ( Show , Eq )
newtype WriterIO a = W { runW :: Writer [ Event ] a}
deriving ( Monad , MonadWriter [ Event ] )
runWriterIO :: WriterIO a -> ( a , [ Event ] )
runWriterIO = runWriter .
runW
instance MonadConnection String WriterIO where
connectODBC connString = tell [ Open connString ] >> return connString
quickQuery ' conn cmd params =
tell [ Query conn cmd params ] >>
return [ [ SqlInteger 1 ]
run conn cmd params= tell [ Run conn cmd params ] >> return 0
commit conn = tell [ Commit conn ]
disconnect conn = tell [ Disconnect conn ]
In our MonadConnection instance , we are not only returning the values as before , but we are also using the tell function to log certain information about each function as they are called .
This way , when parsing the results of the Event list , we can determine whether our expectations were met .
Let ’s write a simple example of how it actually works to capture the results .
Imagine this contrived example .
hasRecord :: MonadConnection c m => m Bool
has Record = do
conn <- connectODBC
" dsn=testdb "
r <- quickQuery ' conn " SELECT * FROM testdb WHERE id <= ? "
[ toSql ( 2 :: Int ) ]
disconnect conn
return ( length r > 0 )
Running this example is as easy as above from the command line .
Let ’s look at what it might produce :
ghci > :t runWriterIO has Record
runWriterIO has Record :: ( Bool , [ Event ] )
ghci > runWriterIO has Record
( True , [ Open " dsn=testdb " , Query " dsn=testdb " " SELECT * FROM testdb WHERE id <= ? "
[ SqlInt32 2 ] , Disconnect " dsn=testdb " ] )
What this was able to do was not only return the value , but also the logged events based upon what was called with the given arguments so that I may use any number of functions to analyze the event list .
Let ’s write one last test against our setSchema function where we make sure that we ’re committing the transaction if the schema_version table does not exist .
We recorded an action of Commit which should show up in our results , so we ’re going to look for that as part of our test .
setSchema_CommitTrans :: Test
setSchema_CommitTrans =
TestCase $ assertBool " Should commit transaction "
( verifyCommit ( runWriterIO $ setSchema " testConn " [ " foobar " ] ) )
where verifyCommit res = let ( r , a ) = res in
Commit " testConn " `elem` a
Now that we ’ve defined the test , we can run it to verify the result .
ghci > runTestTT setSchema_CommitTrans
Cases : 1 Tried : 1 Errors : 0 Failures : 0
Counts {cases = 1 , tried = 1 , errors = 0 , failures = 0 }
As you can see , we ’re now able to detect when things happen in this monadic abstraction .
This leads to a lot of very interesting possibilities .
Especially if we take this example further to allow for some arbitrary IO instances using lifting and monad transformers .
The question is , are there any downsides ?
There is a bit of work to stub out these samples , and once set , not easy to change for your given file .
But once you understand how to do this , testing in a pure environment becomes quite easy .
Taking lessons learned from the Haskell world , could we apply them to F# ?
Monadic Abstraction in F# ?
Understanding what we know about monads in Haskell , what I ’d like is the opportunity to do the same with F# monads .
You may recall that that the standard for the monad in Haskell looks like the following .
class Monad m where
(>>= ) :: m a -> ( a -> m b ) -> m b
(>>) :: m a -> m b -> m b
return :: a -> m a
fail :: String -> m a
As you can see , it ’s using a typeclass to define the monad in that we could easily swap out instances .
In F# , monadic instances by a simple class which contains Delay , Bind and Return functions as the bare minimum defined such as the following outline :
type MonadBuilder =
abstract member Bind : # Monad <'a > * ( 'a -> # Monad <'b > ) -> # Monad <'b>
abstract member Return : ' a -> # Monad <'a >
abstract member Delay : ( unit -> ' a ) – > 'a
Where # Monad is replaced with a concrete type of some sort such as ‘ a list , ‘ a option , Async < ’a > and so on .
Using this as an outline , we can define such things as the Identity Monad such as the following .
type Identity <'a > =
I of 'a
type IdentityBuilder ( ) =
member x .
Bind ( x : Identity <'a > , k : 'a -> Identity <'b > ) =
match x , k with
| I x , f -> f x
member x .
Return ( i : ' a ) : Identity <'a > = I i
member x .
Delay ( f ) = f ( )
let ident = new Identity Builder ( )
let runIdentity = function
| I x -> x
let iResult =
ident { let !
f = I " foo "
return f
}
let result = runIdentity iResult
When we look at the above code , we realize that there really is n’t an easy way to abstract this in such a way that we could say , substitute an Identity monad for an async monad and expect it to continue with the code using the current way that F# sugars the monadic syntax .
It ’s not to say it might not be able to get done , it ’s just not worth the effort at this point using the existing sugaring .
Others have taken different angles such as such as with simple operators and template expansion , but in this case , I do n’t think that ’s enough to help .
Instead , it ’s best to use the existing mocking frameworks that we already have to trace such behaviors .
The support of monads in F # at this juncture is limited by this fact that one monad cannot be substituted for another .
But this does n’t stop me from enjoying monads in F# , but that ’s for another post .
Conclusion
As you can see , monadic abstractions using type classes can be very useful in order to isolate side effects and test with pure values .
This gives us the ability to not only stub out our values , but also record the actions taken in a mock - ish way so that we observe our expectations .
Unfortunately , the way that F# monads were implemented does not lend itself to this operation , but my hope is that this is supported at some point .
There is still more to come in this series , including an exploration of cleaning up our code .
With such tools as HLint and others , we can better understand the language by some of the suggestions given .
And maybe you too could follow the Haskell Evolution , and maybe F# one in the future ?
But Stéphane Dion , who leads the Liberals and who would become the coalition ’s prime minister , dismissed the idea of working with Mr. Harper and said the Conservatives ’ budget was unlikely to satisfy the opposition ’s economic demands .
“ We do not want any more of his words , we do n’t believe them , ” Mr. Dion told reporters before the closed doors of the House of Commons .
“ We want to see changes , monumental changes . ”
Opposition leaders said they would continue to try to form a new coalition , and strongly criticized Mr. Harper ’s attempt to thwart them .
“ He ’s put a lock on the door on the House of Commons , ” Jack Layton , the leader of the New Democrats , told reporters .
“ He refuses to face the people of Canada through their elected representatives . ”
The opposition ’s move to form a new coalition has , in turn , elicited sharp criticisms from some Conservative members .
“ That is as close to treason and sedition as I can imagine , ” Bob Dechert , a Conservative member , said Wednesday , echoing a refrain heard widely in Alberta , the prime minister ’s home province .
Technically , what Mr. Harper did was to “ prorogue ” Parliament , a move that stops all actions on bills and the body ’s other business , and thus goes well beyond an adjournment ( which was not available to Mr. Harper in any event , as it requires parliamentary approval ) .
It is not unprecedented  prorogation is used occasionally to introduce a new legislative agenda  but this is the first time any Parliament members or constitutional scholars here could recall the maneuver being used in the midst of a political crisis and over the objections of Parliament .
Mr. Harper declared the parliamentary suspension after a two - and - a - half hour meeting in Ottawa with Ms. Jean .
While no governor general has ever previously rejected a prime minister ’s request to prorogue Parliament , several constitutional scholars said Mr. Harper was the first one to have asked permission when he did not have the support of the legislature .
“ That ’s why they spent two and a half hours talking , ” said C. E. S. Franks , a professor emeritus of political studies at Queen ’s University in Kingston , Ontario .
Chanel , Yves Saint Laurent , Givenchy , Viktor & Rolf and so many others have been trying to convince us for some time now that goth style is , in terms of clothing , rather more like an edgier fashion statement , instead of the sheer outcome of weirdness or despair , as many might think .
Therefore , bulky jewelry , bold darker tones , lots of leather and , not to forget , lots of lace and flowing fabrics have been “ stealing ” the spotlight on the catwalks , especially in the winter - fall collections .
A lot alike its medieval version , the soft goth style for the 2008/2009 season has gone for maxi lengths of the skirts and the dresses , definitely for some stylish high - necks , and for the everlasting leather skinny pants .
Furthermore , the colors also have an outstanding effect in the overall impression they make , as one can find , besides the darker colors , some pleasant surprises - lilac , purple tones , as well as gray and soft green shades making their way onto the fancy fabrics .
The rough look , so often misinterpreted as resembling a “ witch ” in appearence , is softly tempered by the feminine accents of some airy chiffon layers floating around , or by delicate lace accents .
Delicate ribbons , as well as the knitted clothes , are back in high style and have been the hit of the fall lately , especially when fashionistas like Keira Knightley and Sienna Miller have been spotted walking on The British Independent Film Awards red carpet in some gothic see - through lace dresses .
Despite the fact that there are voices stating that lace is “ an evening thing , ” which cannot face up the risks of daylight , extravagant collections signed Alexander McQueen , Prada , and so on have paired it with leather or wool , and have taken it to the streets .
This ancient Chinese story today which is about Duke Mu of the Zhou Dynasty .
This time I will be translating it myself .
— –
Duke Mu of Qin once went out and lost his swiftest horse , and went to look for it himself .
He saw that some people killed the horse , and were eating the meat .
Duke
Mu said to them , “ That was my swiftest horse ! ”
Then the men got frightened and immediately stood up .
Duke
Mu then said , “ I have heard that if one eats the meat of a fast horse without having some ale will kill them , ” and then Duke Mu gave the men some ale one by one .
Those who killed the horse drank the ale and then left ashamed .
3 years after this incident , The State of Jin attacked the state of Qin and Duke Mu was under siege .
Those who in the past ate the horse meat said to each other , “ We can go and die and repay the the grace of drinking ale with our horse meat . ”
The siege then had ended .
Duke
Mu in the end through this way overcame his challenges and was able to triumph over Jin .
He Captured Duke Hui of Jin and then returned to his home .
This is a situation where kindness was applied and good fortune was returned from it .
— –
Now in this ancient Chinese story we see the result of kindness pays off in the long run .
I wo n’t lie I might not have done the same if I saw my best horse being eaten .
Now , when I was translating the story , I did n’t see anything that would give an exact number of how many people were eating the horse but the main point of the story is that is better to be kind than malevolent .
I have to say though this story is much nicer to read than hearing that old honey and fly cliche .
I use the term ale for the Chinese character for 酒 , not wine because wine came into existence late on in Chinese History , the first form of alcoholic drink was some sort of ale like or beer substance made from wheat in the northern areas of China , so I feel ale is more appropriate .
This is probably the best ancient story you can find to show why being kind is better than being cold - hearted not only in ancient Chinese times , but for any time in the world .
This is a picture of Xi An with me in it .

As I read Incest , I realized that something which I had always taken to be unique , the voice of Myra Breckinridge , was actually that of Anaïs in all the flowing megalomania of the diaries .
Of course , I had not read the diaries then , but even so , if only for that one thundering voice , I am forever in her debt .

The major coal ash spill that occurred in eastern Tennessee on Monday covered an area of approximately 400 acres in debris from a retention lake near the Kingston Fossil Plant .
The Tennessee Valley Authority , the largest utility company in the United States , assured the locals that the water was safe to drink , despite the fact that approximately one billion gallons of coal fly ash – a byproduct of burning coal – spilled into nearby rivers and polluted them severely .
Tom Kilgore , the leader of TVA , said on Sunday that the company would pay for testing the quality of water in wells around the spill site , so as to reassure some 2-300 affected residents that the spill posed no immediate danger to their health .
An entire neighborhood in Harriman was flooded , and the debris made its way into the Emory River , which prompted concerns for people living in nearby Kingston .
Although it exhibits a PR - friendly facade , TVA also refuses to let independent observers take pictures and water samples from the affected area .
Two photographers who tried to capture the site on film were detained by TVA police and held in custody for about an hour before being released .
The two , members of the Knoxville - based United Mountain Defense , said that they wanted to take water samples of their own , to have it independently tested .
“ This is an issue of national importance .
People need to know if the water is safe or not , ” said David Cooper , one of the photographers .
The illegal detention was widely criticized by civil rights groups , which said that the very core of American freedom was infringed upon by the actions of TVA police .
They argued that people had a right to know the scale of the disaster , and also to see for themselves the devastation .
There are currently no laws in place to prevent people from taking water samples out of national rivers or creeks , they added .
The danger now is that the ash spill will dry out , which would mean that a cloud of ash , similar to the one released by a volcano , will roam the region and deposit itself on everything it comes across .
Emergency response teams are currently working to clear the area of potentially hazardous remains .
The times are unprecedented .
Not since 1861 have we watched the last gasps of an outgoing administration with such anxiety .
Then the nation was concerned with drift and inertia ; now we watch for further ideological mischief .
Republicans were aghast in 2001 to discover that President Bill Clinton ’s staff allegedly had dropped the “ W ” from White House computer keyboards .
Frat house stuff .
George W. Bush has left a legacy significantly more troubling , measured by the breakdown of normal government processes , as well as of constitutional guarantees and practices .
We watch last - minute rushes to implement new administrative rules , to transform and burrow political appointees into tenured civil servants , to further weaken environmental safeguards , to shift public funds to a desired end , and to lay down policy declarations to leave the current administration ’s successors bound or embarrassed until they are undone .
Think , for example , about the fate of official records .
Will they be removed or shredded to further obscure this administration ’s doings ?
Nourished on secrecy from its inception , and carefully concealing many of its activities through the years , the Bush administration may be determined to make one last play for secrecy by taking its records and storing them in a Dallas warehouse , pending a Bush library .
In these waning weeks , a group of us is locked in legal combat with Vice President Dick Cheney and his corps of unseen advisers , seeking an injunction to prevent them from leaving office with their e-mail records .
[ Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington , et al. , v. Richard B. Cheney , et al , Civil Action No. 08-1548 , U.S. District Court , District of Columbia ] .
Cheney and his team are resisting at every turn , following a strategy of running out the clock and thereby implicitly admitting their intention to destroy or take their records .
If Barack Obama as president would withdraw Bush ’s infamous Executive Order 13233 , which effectively repealed the Presidential Records Act of 1978 , Bush and Cheney still can expect to seal their papers for at least 12 years .
If Richard Nixon is their model , count on at least 20 .
The president - elect ’s Web site promises he will reverse Executive Order 13233 nullifying the timely , lawful release of presidential records .
John Podesta , who heads the transition team , acknowledged that , as president , Obama will , “ when appropriate , ” reverse that order .
Some will remember John F. Kennedy ’s famous “ stroke of the pen ” promise for a federal fair housing ordinance in 1960 — unfortunately , Kennedy ’s pen paralysis resulted in an 18 - month delay .
Bush ’s order subverts the 1978 law ’s provisions for public access to presidential records .
It requires the Archivist of the United States to withhold materials if a former president asserts executive privilege , even if the incumbent president disagrees .
Put another way , any assertions of privilege for the papers of Bush and his father must be honored by the incumbent president .
Maybe now this is clearer .
Bush ’s order also stands the right of access on its head .
Now , the burden is on the researcher to show a “ demonstrable , specific need . ”
In short , researchers retain a very expensive right to litigate .
In 1988 , the Circuit Court for the District of Columbia emphatically rejected President Ronald Reagan ’s order directing the Archives to accept any claims advanced by former President Nixon to block release of his presidential materials , repudiating Reagan ’s contention that the Archivist might legally and independently support a former president .
The Bush order is no different , for it requires the Archivist to honor the former president ’s claims even when the incumbent disagrees with them .
Such a course constitutes nothing less than the incumbent ’s abdication of his obligation of fidelity to the law .
Bush ’s action provides no end to the mutual back - scratching for that fellowship of ex-presidents .
If the incumbent and former president agree to block release , the president and his Department of Justice must defend the assertion of privilege , thus saving his predecessor potentially significant legal fees .
Richard Nixon wrote endless volumes of memoirs to support his lawyer habit .
Make no mistake : the Bush order broke new ground .
Allowing a former president ’s family or personal representative to assert privilege is novel , if not bizarre .
It delegates and brazenly enlarges an ever - more luxuriant executive privilege upon former presidents — something the Bush administration has been very adept at doing for itself .
The shadowy doctrine of executive privilege has been elevated to a personal right , extending a lifetime , and even beyond .
You can take it with you , if Bush has his way .
The order is beyond audacious .
Incumbent presidents decide and judge the nature of national security , not former presidents .
If the incumbent sees no national security issue at stake , why should a former president , ever anxious to preserve and enhance his reputation , make that determination ?
Bush ’s order already has freed his father from scholarly scrutiny , now some four years overdue .
Only the timely and gracious intervention of Nancy Reagan prevented President Bush from sealing the Reagan papers .
Those documents might tell us more about George H. W. Bush ’s role in the Iran - Contra affair , other than having to go to the bathroom , or something like that , when the sordid business was discussed in the National Security Council ’s proceedings .
Repudiating Executive Order 13233 is essential .
This is not a partisan matter ; even the Republican - controlled Congress favored repeal in 2004 , but Tom DeLay effectively buried it for Bush , and Sen. Mitch McConnell , R - Ky. , similarly blocked action in the Senate last year .
Rep. Dan Burton , R - Ind. — of all people — led the move to repeal ; apparently he believed this was the only way he could get at the Clinton papers .
The prospects of George W. Bush and Dick Cheney proclaiming executive privilege long after they fade from their official duties is staggering .
Their penchant for secrecy undoubtedly would insure significant gaps in any attempts to fathom the history of their deeds and actions .
President - elect Obama has given us a promise .
It must be delivered .

Kilauea is one of the most active volcanoes on Earth
It has been described as a geologist 's dream - a unique opportunity to study up close the volcanic processes that built the Earth 's continents .
Drillers looking for geothermal energy in Hawaii have inadvertently put a well right into a magma chamber .
Molten rock pushed back up the borehole several metres before solidifying , making it perfectly safe to study .
Magma specialist Bruce Marsh says it will allow scientists to observe directly how granites are made .
" This is unprecedented ; this is the first time a magma has been found in its natural habitat , " the Johns Hopkins University , Baltimore , professor told BBC News .
" Before , all we had to deal with were lava flows ; but they are the end of a magma 's life .
They 're lying there on the surface , they 've de-gassed .
It 's not the natural habitat .

" It 's the difference between looking at dinosaur bones in a museum and seeing a real , living dinosaur roaming out in the field . "
Professor Marsh has been discussing the discovery here at the American Geophysical Union 's Fall Meeting 2008 .
In control This is not the first time drillers have encountered magma ; the depth of the hit and the setting are , however , thought to be unique .
The exploratory well was being put down in the east of Hawaii's Big Island , through the basalt lava fields formed by Kilauea Volcano .
It could be this is how continents could have been started to be built on the planet
Bruce Marsh
The idea was to find steam from waters heated deep underground in fractured rock , to drive turbines on the surface to generate electricity .
The company behind the project , Puna Geothermal Venture , has had a successful power operation in the area for 15 years .
But the drillers were shocked - not only to hit magma but to also hit such a big heat source at the relatively shallow depth of 2.5 km .
" It 's hotter than hell ; it 's over a thousand degrees centigrade , " said Professor Marsh .
Bill Teplow , a consulting geologist with US Geothermal Inc , who oversaw the drilling , stressed there was no risk of an explosion or of a volcanic eruption at the site .
" It was easily controlled in the well bore because of the magma 's highly viscous nature .
It flowed up the well bore 5 - 10 m but then the cool drilling fluid caused it to solidify and stop flowing , " said Mr Teplow .
" At no time were we in danger of losing control of the well . "

The breakthrough was made in 2005 .
Only now are researchers confident enough about their work to discuss the details publicly .
They are not sure how large the magma chamber is , but some initial testing suggests it may have been put in place by activity from Kilauea in the 1950s , perhaps even the 1920s .
Professor Marsh said the chamber was docile and slowly cooling .
The consistency of the magma was like chilled pancake syrup , he said .
It is hoped the site can now become a laboratory , with a series of cores drilled around the chamber to better characterise the crystallisation changes occurring in the rock as it loses temperature .
The magma is a dacite , making it chemically distinct from the basalt which forms nearly the entire mass of the Hawaiian Islands and the surrounding oceanic crust .
It has a much higher silica content .
Dacite magma chemistry is similar to that of the granitic core of the continents .
Professor Marsh said the Puna material , therefore , may represent the first time that the actual process of differentiation of continental - type rock from primitive oceanic basalt had been observed in situ .
" Granites are about 75 % SiO2 and basalts are about 50 % .
Average continental material is probably in between , at about 60 % , " explained Professor Marsh .
" Here 's one that turns out to be 67 % silica .
It 's up there ; it 's a very respectable silicic magma .
And it's in the middle of the ocean , and it could be this is how continents could have been started to be built on the planet . "
A small section of the Puna dacite viewed in a geologist 's microscope Geothermal experts are also fascinated by the event .
The Kilauea encounter is by far the shallowest and the hottest encounter of rock in a commercial operation , and it will be studied to see if there are lessons that can be applied to electrical generation project elsewhere in the world .
" We were at about 2.5 k m which is pretty routine drilling depth , " explained Mr Teplow .
" But that is half the depth of experimental projects in Europe and Australia where they are drilling very deep into hot granite - some 5 - 5.5 km down - and getting 260C rock ; and here we 're getting 1,050C rock . "

For many people who use a computer , knowing where to store growing amounts of data can become tricky .
You start off with one disk , run out of space , buy a bigger one etc .
And if you have a camcorder you ’ll be generating gigabytes of data for every Mini DV tape you record .
Also , you may have a digital video recorder attached to your TV and wish to permanently keep some of the programmes / films you ’ve recorded .
Now you ’re talking hundreds of gigabytes , if not terabytes of storage that are required to handle all this data .
And then there ’s the problem of backups … oh boy , this will be a fun project 🙂
Here ’s a series of articles that tackle this tricky subject , where I describe the choices I made , the problems encountered and the solutions found during my quest to build my own ZFS home fileserver , or ZFS home NAS box ( network attached storage ) .
A quote from Paul Venezia , InfoWorld : ( click the picture to go to the full InfoWorld article )
It ’s not every day that the computer industry delivers the level of innovation found in Sun ’s ZFS .
The fluidity , the malleability , and the scalability of ZFS far surpass any file system available now on any platform .
More and more advances in the science of IT are based on simply multiplying the status quo .
ZFS breaks all the rules here , and it arrives in an amazingly well - thought - out and nicely implemented solution .
We ’re talking about a file system that can address 256 quadrillion zettabytes of storage , and that can handle a maximum file size of 16 exabytes .
For reference , a zettabyte is equal to one billion terabytes .
In order to bend your mind around what ZFS is and what it can do , you need to toss out just about everything you know about file systems and start over .

Two experts on Auschwitz argue for and against the idea that the former Nazi death camp should be allowed to crumble away .
Historian Robert Jan Van
Pelt says that once the last survivor has died it should be left for nature to reclaim , and eventually forgotten .
But former Polish Foreign Minister Wladyslaw Bartoszewski , once an inmate , says Auschwitz must be preserved to bear witness to the fate of its victims .
ROBERT JAN VAN PELT , HISTORIAN AND AUTHOR Many Auschwitz survivors have told me that a visit to the camp can teach little to those who were not imprisoned there .
Their view is best summarised in the text of Alain Resnais ' celebrated movie Night and Fog ( 1955 ) , written by the camp survivor Jean Cayrol .
As the camera pans across the empty barracks , the narrator warns the viewer that these remains do not reveal the wartime reality of " endless , uninterrupted fear " .
The barracks offer no more than " the shell , the shadow " .
Should the world marshal enormous resources to preserve empty shells and faint shadows ?
Certainly , as long as there are survivors who desire to return to the place of their suffering , it is appropriate that whatever remains of the camps is preserved .
Many of the same survivors who have told me that I can derive little knowledge from a visit to the camp acknowledge that it was good for them to return to the place , anchoring an all - encompassing nightmare back to a particular place .
The world owes it to them not to close such an opportunity for a return .
As long as one survivor is still alive , the remains of the camp should remain available .
It might be that ... the best way to honour those who were murdered in the camp and those who survived is by sealing it from the world
But what when there are no survivors left ?
In his autobiographical novel The Long Voyage ( 1963 ) , former Buchenwald inmate Jorge Semprun considered what ought to happen with the remains of that camp after the death of the last survivor , " when there will no longer be any real memory of this , only the memory of memories related by those who will never know ( as one knows the acidity of a lemon , the feel of wool , the softness of a shoulder ) what all this really was . "
Semprun hoped that grass , roots and brambles would be allowed to take over the camp , destroying the remainder of the fences , barracks and crematorium , effacing " this camp constructed by men " .
As we commemorate the 64th anniversary of the arrival of the Red Army at the gates of Auschwitz - the term " liberation " is not really appropriate as most of the inmates had been evacuated a few days earlier in death marches - it is good to begin thinking about the future first anniversary of the day when the last Auschwitz survivor has died .
It might be that we will agree that the best way to honour those who were murdered in the camp and those who survived is by sealing it from the world , allowing grass , roots and brambles to cover , undermine and finally efface that most unnatural creation of Man .
At that future date , may the slowly crumbling debris of decay suggest the final erasure of memory .
Robert Jan Van
Pelt is a professor at the School of Architecture , University of Waterloo in Ontario , Canada .
He is a world - renowned authority on Auschwitz , and the author of several books on the subject , including Auschwitz : 1270 to the Present .
WLADYSLAW BARTOSZEWSKI , CHAIRMAN OF THE INTERNATIONAL AUSCHWITZ COUNCIL
The only people with a full and undeniable right to decide the future of the Auschwitz - Birkenau Memorial are the hundreds of thousands murdered in this concentration camp .
The prisoners whom I met as prisoner number 4427 , when I was detained in Auschwitz between September 1940 and April 1941 , are among them .
To some I owe my survival .
They saved me , guided not only by the impulse of the heart , which was heroic at the time .
They also believed that the survivors will bear witness to the tragedy which in Auschwitz - Birkenau became the fate of so many Europeans .
Thus I and numerous former prisoners fulfil the testament of the victims and convey to subsequent generations the truth about those days .
But the moment when there will be no more eyewitnesses left is inexorably approaching .
What remains is the belief that when the people are gone , " the stones will cry out " .
The ruins of crematoria and gas chambers in Birkenau , the empty bunks in barracks , the dark cells in Block 11 and the Wall of Death - all of them will cry out .
Therefore , it is meaningful to save stones , ruins , and buildings , even if the price is high .
It lies in the nature of man that when no tangible traces remain , events of the past fall into oblivion .
If we let the memorial cease to exist , we will take a great burden on our conscience - we will trample upon the testament of the victims
We do renovate castles , preserve paintings and old libraries .
The best example is the memory of ancient Greece and Rome - centuries have passed but it is still vivid , thanks , among others , to the remains of both civilisations .
Why then should we let be forgotten the Memorial to the suffering of thousands of prisoners from many countries , and to the extermination of Jews ?
The place which has grown to be a global symbol and a warning against all forms of contempt for mankind and of genocide ?
There is no other place like that in the world - no other KZ [ Konzentrationslager , or concentration camp ] was a concentration camp and extermination camp at the same time .
Right after the war , there occurred ideas - which fortunately have not been implemented - to demolish the remains of Auschwitz - Birkenau and plough the area up .
The justification given was that a place of such cruel murder should vanish from the face of the Earth .
I do not wish to say that the intentions were not honourable , but in my view disguised behind them were other , not entirely realised , motivations .
When a man commits evil , he tries to obliterate its traces .
Auschwitz - Birkenau is like a continuous sting of remorse that torments humanity , especially Europe .
It is a sting of remorse for every person who is indifferent to the suffering of others .
Auschwitz - Birkenau must forever remain an unhealed , burning wound , which wakes people up from moral lethargy and forces them to take responsibility for the fate of our world .
If we let the memorial cease to exist , we will take a great burden on our conscience .
We will trample upon the testament of the victims .
I hope to be a false prophet in saying that , but if we allow Auschwitz - Birkenau to disappear from the face of the Earth , we might just be opening a way for a similar evil to return .
Prof Wladyslaw Bartoszewski is a historian , author , diplomat and former Auschwitz inmate .
Two times Polish foreign minister , Prof Bartoszewski is currently secretary of state and plenipotentiary of the prime minister for international dialogue .
A selection of your comments : I have never visited Auschwitz but have been to Bergen - Belsen several times .
Because it was demolished shortly after it was liberated , there is little at Belsen now beyond monuments .
I feel it was a tragedy that the decision to demolish it was taken , albeit that the imperative preventing the spread of typhoid etc made the decision almost inevitable .
To take a similar decision about Auschwitz when those sorts of pressures do not exist would seem to me to show a fundamental lack of humanity .
Dave , Hatfield
With a sea war grave we leave the ship to rest and we stop divers swimming the wreck .
I would prefer to see something similar for Auschwitz - secured and left to be reclaimed by nature .
Future generations can learn of such atrocities ( and this by far is not the only example of mass genocide ) from visits to museums and through education .
Spend the money on ensuring that it becomes part of our education and leave Auschwitz to rest .
Tom Calthrop , Bequia , Grenadines
As a child I remember the letters my mother would get from survivors of the camps looking for possible living relatives .
In 1996 , I went to Auschwitz to see the unhumanity that unbridled bigotry engenders .
I am not a Jew , but the victims were not limited to Jews .
Poles , Russians , and political unacceptables from all over Europe had their fates sealed at these camps .
To shutter them from the public is to gloss over those failings of the human spirit that allow these camps to exist in the first place .
We must be reminded of our failures as humans , just as we must be reminded of our successes .
Failure to do that will allow bigotry to again reappear ... as in the Gulag ... Guantanamo ... the killing fields of Cambodia ... the refuge camps in the Sudan .
William Bloch , St. Charles , IL Preserve it .
If not , the lessons will be forgotten and evil will keep repeating .
This should stand as a memorial for man 's evil against man , not just the Jews and the victim of the Nazis
Gregory Natsch , Jefferson City , MO USA
It should be kept .
Anything which serves as a reminder of the attempted destruction of a race , a faith , a belief system should be maintained ad infinitum .
Bill , Hemel Hempstead UK
Only when you stand inside a gas chamber and see the marks left by thousands of fingernails in the concrete walls as men , women and children blindly struggled for an escape can you even begin to comprehend the level of atrocity and suffering .
The camp infrastructure must endure as a memorial and witness to inhumanity on such scale .
Frank McKay , St. Albans UK
As a non-Jew who visited Auschwitz last year I can only say that it should be preserved as a forceful reminder of man 's inhumanity to man and a warning not to let this be repeated .
If we simply abandon this site to the whims of nature , we would be denying that it was created as a result of human processes .
Human processes must therefore preserve it .
Roy Kift , Castrop - Rauxel , Germany
It should remain , not only as a memorial to the thousands that died but also a reminder to the world what happens when dictators are ignored .
Jessie , Essex
My father was as political prisoner incarcerated and tortured in a German Concentration camp .
He survived and as a child I heard his tortured nightmares in my bed next door .
Having experienced the sufferings of an inmate in my own family and considering the enormity of the crimes to mankind committed by the Nazi regime I feel that these facilities should be maintained forever , and all costs .
To remember the past , for the sake of the future .
Peter Brinkmann , Berlin / Germany
I can appreciate both sides of the arguement and have sympathy with both views .
However on balance I believe future generations would be amazed at us if we did not preserve something that has been so fundamental in shaping the post war world and politics .
I would vote to keep it
Ian Humphreys , Caterham UK
As a Jew whose great - grandparents dies in Auschwitz , I think it should be preserved .
I went to Poland to learn more about what had happened , and though was it left is only a shell , it still has things to teach us , things that may be forgotten without physical evidence .
I know I want my daughter to be able to go there one day and to learn of the past as well as hope for the future .
Rachel , Israel
As a young soldger i saw the mass graves of belsen , all the remains of all these camps must be preserved !!. it will not stop such things happening again .
it is happening now and will happen again .
but it proves it did happen
arthur , manchester
As beautiful as letting earth grow over the remains of Auschwitz sounds , I think preserving the site will , in the long run , be more important .
Our memories are too short to risk letting the world doubt the existence of the Holocaust , especially Auschwitz , due to the lack of physical evidence .
Let us not aid the Holocaust deniers ; preserve Auschwitz even though it is only a shell of the horrors that took place within .
Anne , Canada
I do n't agree that Auschwitz should be allowed to become overgrown and disappear .
That would be too easy for us all .
I also disagree that the stones have no value .
Only this weekend I was moved to tears by a mere account in the Times of a group of school children visiting Auschwitz and other camps and memorials .
It had obviously had a massive effect on that generation and will , hopefully inform their actions in the future .
I have n't been but I intend to do so one day .
Keep them and preserve the memories .
Lesley , Hope Valley Crumble away ?
No .
The memory of man is short .
What is out of sight is often out of mind .
Stalin said , " One death is a tragedy , a million is a statistic . "
But these were not just statistics .
They were all real , live human beings .
Historian George Santayana 's famous quote is apt : " Those who do not remember the past are condemned to repeat it . "
If these burial grounds are allowed to fade , so to will the probability that it will happen again , by inverse proportion .
In a very real sense they are open graves .
Just like we must maintain places of beauty for the goodness they inspire , so these places must be maintained , and their horrific stories told anew to each generation , to prevent it from ever happening again .
Dannan Tavona , FR , DD , Eugene , OR , USA I went to Auschwitz as part of the Learning From Auschwitz Project , and although it can be argued the full horror can never be converyed I would argue that it will still change people and their attitudes forever .
There are ao many dreadful and inspirational stories to teach people how cruel mankind can be and jsut exactly what can be done about it .
Leaving Auschwitz as a blight on this earth will ensure people remember what happened last time and stop it .
Lucy Coulson , Nuneaton
Why keep an wounded soul open , let it seal it 's faith by not reminding ourselves over and over again ... last man stand , let it rest forever ...
Clay Batt , Baulkham Hills , Australia
These camps should be left to crumble and be allowed to be consummed by nature .
Perhaps a more fitting memorial should be erected .
One that would stand the test of time and act as a reminder and a testament to those that suffered .
John Allen , basingstoke I visited both Auschwitz and Auschwitz - Birkenau on Boxing Day last year .
While I thought I knew what to expect it was the sheer scale of , particularly , Auschwitz - Birkenau that remains in my mind ; no film can convey the size of Auschwitz - Birkenau that you can see standing in the tower above the main gate and to see the , admittedly , ruins of what is left stretching out in front of you .
Polish school children are taken to one of the concentration camp sites as part of their schooling and it acts as a reminder as to what was done in their country .
For me both Auschwitz and Auschwitz - Birkenau acted as a horrifying example of what happens when a race attempts to carry out genocide .
Genocide is still going on in parts of the world today .
The Nazi concentration camps were not just about exterminating Jews but many other ' undesirables ' too .
I think that Auschwitz - Birkenau should be kept as a reminder and a warning to future generations .
Simon Jones , Cambridge , UK NO .
Auschwitz is a part of our human history and should not be left to ruins .
It is a reminder of the suffering and truimph of the human spirit in the midst of tyrrany and opression , just like we have the hiroshima memorial or the crosses of normandy .
If it be left to ruins , there will be no évidence to mock those people who deny the holocaust .
Auschwitz should be seen by generations for them to know that goodness always truimphs over evil in the end .
Dante , france Obviously while there are still survivors who want it to remain , it should do .
However , once there are no more , would it not be better to destroy the remains of Auschwitz and build something on the site as a memorial to those who suffered there ?
Perhaps a hospital or something similar , as a symbol of hope over ( literally ) suffering ?
Auschwitz has not yet disappeared , but genocide has still occurred after the end of the Second World War .
We must never forget the evil that occurred , but we do n't need Auschwitz 's remains to keep the memories fresh .
HS , Cornwall , England Auschwitz should be preserved as a reminder to all future generations of the failure of humanity to save innocent lives as well as demonstrating the evil of despot rulers .
Auschwitz was also a POW Camp where British Soldiers were detained .
Homosexuals , Jehovahs Witnesses , Gypsies , Anti-Facists , the mantally ill and freemasons all suffered at the hands of Nazis none of this should be forgotten
Mark Johns , Ottery St Mary , Devon , UK
No this place must be kept as a memorial to all those and their families .
Perhaps just as important as a reminder of what happened at this time for tomorrows children .
This should be the same for all of these places .
One day i am going to take my children there and explain what happened .
John , West Sussex
It should be left to crumble but the ground should never be used for anything else ; left as it is .
How could someone preserve this abomination ?
To do so would mean actually repeating the building of it , albeit for a different reason .
T , UK I believe that Auschwitz should be preserved .
Humanity easily remembers its triumphs , but soon forgets its evils .
To future generations , the Holocaust may seem too horrible to believe or remember .
We need to preserve Auschwitz and other physical reminders of our past so that does not happen .
Lee , Japan
I have no connection to any victim of Auschwitz but visited it in 2002 .
The sheer horror of what went on there is still unimaginable but it does give a good account of it .
I remarked that it should be a place that everyone should visit to appreciate what humans can do to one another as a reminder that we should never let this kind of things happen again .
I feel strongly that we should maintain Auschwitz so that I can show my son what happened and eventually so he can show his son .
It is important that physical embodiments exist to help people who were n't there to grasp , even in a small way , the sheer inhumaness of what Auschwitz and other camps stood for .
Dominic Martinez , Manchester , UK I have visited Auschwitz and was moved by what I saw .
It was a harrowing visit but it did make me think alot about man 's inhumanity to man .
It should be preserved as a testimany to this inhumanity and for future generations to physically see an indication of what the camp was like rather than read about it .
I think there is too much emphasis placed on the Jewish aspect of the " holocaust " .
There were other ethnic groups such as the Romanies who are never mentioned .
There have also been other episodes of mass slaughter eg Cambodia and Rwanda , which are not treated with the same publicity or moral outrage .
The concentration camps of Europe were an outrage to civilisation and should be remembered and not allowed to deteriorate .
Tom Ray , Stotfold , England I think it should be preserved for generations to come as a solemn reminder of man 's inhumanity to man and the horrors of genocide .
odette brightmore , nottingham Having visited Auschwitz it is a truly moving place which in my opinion should be kept open .
It does not matter how many books you have read on it nothing defines the horror of the place until you have visited .
As was said in the article if we forget we will be forced to remember .
Dave , Edinburgh I am disgusted and absolutely shocked that anyone would seek to canvas opinions like this .
Auschwitz is not just there for the survivors - it is there for all of us - Jew and Gentile alike .
A reminder to all humanity of just how dangerous politicians and their followers can become .
Dennis , Johannesburg South Africa
Places like these should be preserved - least we forget .
The Colleseum in Rome has been preserved and that was a place of death .
What happened in the Second World War should not be forgotten .
I am in my early 50s and it amazes me that some 18 year olds do not know what a Death Camp was and have never heard of the Holacaust and that is bad .
In the UK there are school trips to such places and I strongly believe that this is good as the next generations must learn from the past mistakes and horrors of previous generations and learn from them .
I believe that too many of the younger generation are being shielded from the bad things in life and only experience the good .
They need to know the difference between good and bad / evil .
Susan Berry , Tramore , Ireland
All actions have consequence , and wars are not fought by the generals who lead the armies .
The only tribute to the fallen is their gravestones .
What remembrance is there for the innocent caught up in the struggles of empires ?
As long as the memorials of victorious war are preserved , so should the symbols of war 's evils .
As long as the weapons of war are lovingly preserved , so should the scenes of mass weeping be preserved - until there is no more war .
Realist , Los Angeles USA
This is a very delicate subject on which there will be many points of view , hence , I think it should be for the survivors , after which the families , to decide .
Julie Townsend , Eltham / London
I agree with Mr Bartoszewski , that whilst we preserve ancient ruins , we should preserve other important parts of our history that may not be so happily remembered .
People take photographs of the good times , the weddings , the birthdays , but they rarely document those things which are unhappy ... funerals , illness .. and yet these things are our history too .
Preserve Auschwitz - it should be a sobering reminder of part of History which would all too easily be forgotten and like the funerals , the illnesses of life , Auschwittz is sadly part of our history too .
Christopher , Kendal Auschwitz should be preserved because to do otherwise might give comfort to future generations of holocaust deniers .
Of course the reality of the horrors experienced by inmates can not be fully appreciated by those of us fortunate enough to live in civilised democracies but I would say that a partial appreciation is better than no appreciation at all
Nigel Davies , Stockport UK
It should be preserved in my opinion .
Future generations should be able to visit it and be warned against racism , and small mindedness , so that the atrocities should never happen again .
It should stand as a testimony to all those who suffered .
It deserves to stand and they deserveit to stand too !
Karen C. , Luton , England
A few years ago I went on a school trip to Auschwitz .
It was a humbling , and for many , upsetting , experience for our group of 14/15 year olds .
Nothing that we had learnt in the classroom could have prepared us for the experience .
The memories of the vast space , eerie silence and the fact we were merely standing in a place that had claimed so many lives will remain with me forever .
I think it is so important that Auschwitz is preserved in order for future generations to learn about the past and as a reminder that nothing that terrible should be allowed to happen again .
Lyndsey , Nottingham I believe Auschwitz should remain as a memorial to the incredible suffering experienced by so many .
We retain graves of our loved ones why should we not retain a visible memory of the site of the death of so many innocent people ?
Shame that this happened should not come into the equation .
Lindsay MDowell , Darwin Australia
I visited the Auschwitz camp last summer , and whilst I agree that as visitors to the camp in modern times we could never gain a full insight to the full monstrosity or inhumanity of the crimes committed there , the experience was still a very emotional , sobering , and somewhat distressing one .
People should never be allowed to forget the dark depths to which humanity sank in the holocaust , and the Auschwitz camp must remain , not only as a reminder of this , but also a shrine to those who survived the camps , and the millions of innocents that did not .
Simon , Sheffield
It is clearly important to keep Auchwitz .
It is the physical proof of the events of the time and a necessity for educational purposes .
It is only through education that we can learn about the horrors of the concentration camps .
Like the dome at Hiroshima ; it is a very powerful educational tool .
robert halse , Bendigo , Australia Preservation of these places is vital , if only to prevent holocaust deniers the possibility of asking where the evidence is .
I visited Dachau nearly 30 years ago , and it changed my life for ever , making me aware that such events must never be allowed to happen again .
Where will future generations get this kind of experience if the evidence is destroyed ?
Paul A , Brisbane , Australia Auschwitz should never ever be forgot about , and should be looked after so that people in years to come can be reminded about how horrific and terible it really was .
If anything the site should be re built as it was in the war so people can really understand it .
Nick , Shrewsbury
We cannot allow the memory of those horrific events to be forgotten .
A memory of a memory is better than no memory at all .
Would you have the events of 9/11 written out of history ?
After the last survivor has passed , seal the area and let it stand as both a monument to the innocent people who perished there , and a warning of the grisly depths to which the human animal can stoop .
Let it also serve as a beacon of hope and inspiration , that after the ultimate price needlessly paid by so many at just this one camp , evil can be stopped , and punished .
For the times of Auschwitz to be forgotten , to me , is tantamount to condoning it .
David , Aberdare , south Wales
The place speaks for itself .
It is a chilling reminder of mankind 's inhumanity to itself , and in my opinion should be preserved at all cost .
Eduardo Martinez de Salinas , Barcelona , Spain I think Auschwitz , should be preserved as a memorial and a constant reminder of the horror and atrocities that were carried out there , no one should be allowed to forget .
To many people are trying to put out that it never took place !
Graham Todd , Benoni , South Africa .
Under no circumstances .
We must never allow this to be forgotton .
I am a teacher and was horrified to find out last week that my school is taking the Holocaust off of the cirrululm as the head of departmet does not feel that it is relevant anymore .
It will always be relevant and we should never forget .
Oldgirl , Wallington I could never hope to understand the suffering and evil that took place in this camp .
However I do feel that although the final survivors are sadly now very few , those family members and others who were affected by the genocide can take some solace in visiting the remains of the site .
A place to reflect and offer a prayer or thought can be very helpful in healing wounds .
However to preserve the whole site would not in my opinion be the best use of the site and allowing parts to return to nature , would show everyone that the world moves on and heals itself in time
Lord B , Sussex
How will the newer generations remember the atrocities of such camps , if not through its preservation ....
Granted it is only a building .... but stories told and retold need to be preserved ..... making it into a ¨museum¨ should keep the realities of what occured there alive ... if only as a reminder of what happened during those years .....
Let history teach us what other atrocities humanity has allowed ....
Slavery , for one ....
And the destruction of reminders of this shameful reality are slowly dissapearing ..... not only from the landscape but also from the minds of the world ....
Let the shame be shown and shown again .... for we seem to never learn ...
Neil A , Mauritius Auschwitz should be preserved as a reminder and warning to furture generations of the evil mankind is capable of .
This , at least for a few more generations , until time and the flow of history eventually forces it 's finish , in hope that globalization will produce laws and conventions guaranteeing nothing like it will ever occur again .

Nov. 11 , 2008  -- For Dr. George Daley , Sen. Barack Obama 's recent victory in the U.S. presidential election was a hopeful sign for an issue he holds close to his heart -- and which he believes has the potential to save lives .
The issue is stem cell research .
And Daley , immediate past president of the International Society for Stem Cell Research , says that , since the election , hopes have been high that the next four years could signal an era of greater flexibility for scientists in the field .
" We are hopeful that removing restrictions on funding for stem cells will be one of the first acts of the Obama presidency , " Daley said .
" In the research community , we would all breathe a sigh of relief . "
The restrictions , which have been in place since 1994 , have been seen by many in the field as a stifling force .
Though such research was still possible through private and state dollars , the creation of and experimentation on such lines quickly became taboo for many universities and other research centers under fear of scrutiny .
The first hint of a policy change came Aug. 30 when the group Science Debate 2008 received a response to questions they posed to both the Obama and McCain campaigns regarding their positions on federal funds for stem cell research .
" I strongly support expanding research on stem cells , " the response from the Obama team reads .
" I believe that the restrictions that President Bush has placed on funding of human embryonic stem cell research have handcuffed our scientists and hindered our ability to compete with other nations .
" As president , I will lift the current administration 's ban on federal funding of research on embryonic stem cell lines created after Aug.
9 , 2001 through executive order , and I will ensure that all research on stem cells is conducted ethically and with rigorous oversight . "
Most researchers shared Daley 's enthusiasm .
" The next administration adopts the mainstream view of the majority of Americans : that stem cell research offers the best hope and potential for some of the desperately needed cures for currently untreatable diseases , " said James Douglas Engel , professor and chair of the department of cell and developmental biology at the University of Michigan Medical School in Ann Arbor .
" Obviously , if federal funds become available for this research it will hasten our goal of developing cures for these diseases . "
Others said that such a move could put the United States on pace with Israel , Australia , Canada , Japan and a number of Western European countries that have adopted flexible policies to push embryonic stem cell research .
" Politically , this will have an important effect on providing an open policy for stem cell research in the U.S. , and could help increase our country 's status as a leader in the field , " said Dr. Paul Sanberg , director of the Center of Excellence for Aging and Brain Repair at the University of South Florida in Tampa .
But not all agreed that such a reversal would have an immediate positive effect .
" This is principally form over substance , " said Tim McCaffrey , director of The George Washington University Medical Center 's Catherine Birch McCormick Genomics Center in Washington , D.C .
" The benefit to the health of the American public will result only from substantial and sustained increases to the NIH budget , " McCaffrey said .
" Simply changing a particular regulation about the use of federal funds to create new lines will have no impact whatsoever when the funding to take advantage of stem cells is quite limited . "
Lifting a Longstanding Ban
The first executive branch move to block federal funding for the creation of embryos for stem cell research came in 1994 under the pen of President Bill Clinton .
This position was reinforced by President George W. Bush , who , in August 2001 , strengthened the ban on federal funding by barring federal funds for research on all but a few existing embryonic stem cell lines .
What should and should not happen to embryos remains a source of intense debate .
Embryos , which are balls of cells created by putting a sperm cell and an egg cell together and allowing the result to divide , are valuable to researchers because they represent a source of undifferentiated cells not programmed to be any type of cell in particular .
In essence , an embryonic stem cell is a blank check ; scientists hope we will eventually be able to control the development of these cells , making them into whatever tissues are needed .
While some maintain that research on new embryonic cell lines could one day yield treatments and cures for devastating illnesses , others say the embryos represent human life and should not be destroyed .
But with the adversity of the ban came some new approaches .
Among these was the advent of induced pluripotent ( iPS ) cells -- cells which are nudged into a state from which they can differentiate into a limited number of different cell types .
Researchers agree that these cells do not have the degree of flexibility afforded by their embryonic counterparts , but they have , nonetheless , allowed for limited therapeutic research .
Other research that has qualified for federal funding has focused on so - called adult stem cells -- cells which are extracted from adult tissues and tweaked to yield other cell types .
Dr. Neil
Theise , an adult stem cell researcher and professor of pathology and medicine at the Beth Israel Medical Center of Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York , said that a lifting of the embryonic stem cell research ban would " lift the need for political opposition to adult stem cell research , as well " and have benefits across the board for all forms of stem cell research .
" It is by pursuing both paths that practical therapeutic and industrial benefits can manifest in the swiftest , most safe and cost - effective manner , " he said .
Lifting Ban May Not Mean More Money
But others believe that opening the gates to federal funds could have the exact opposite effect , actually decreasing the amount of money available to researchers .
" Unless there is a boost in funding for this research at the NIH , it is highly likely that funding for currently allowed research will actually decrease as the pool of funds gets diluted by new applications , " Sanberg said .
" Overall funding for stem cell research in our country could decrease if the states feel less inclined to fund their own stem cell initiatives in a downward economy , thinking that the federal government is now funding all stem cell research . "
Groups opposed to embryonic stem cell research predicted such a slip in overall funding , as well .
" The concern with new federal policies is that any rush to create new lines from embryos will simply siphon valuable funds away from research with much greater potential , including iPS cells , and especially existing and developing adult stem cell therapies that are already treating patients for dozens of diseases , " said David Prentice , senior fellow for life sciences for the Family Research Council , a Christian political organization that opposes embryonic stem cell research .

Windows 10 Creator Update has promised to bring to the table a great number of changes and overhauls to Microsoft ’s OS and more recently , there has been a confirmation from Microsoft as to the paths of upgrade for the current Windows 10 running smartphones .
According to Microsoft ’s Windows Blog , there is just a number of supported devices for the new Windows 10 Creator Update .
What we know so far is that the ones which are compatible are the Trinity NuAns NEO , the MouseComputer MADOSMA Q601 , VAIO Phone Biz , the SoftBank 503 LV , Alcate ’s Idol 4S , OneTouch Fierce XL , the HP Elite X3 and the Microsoft Lumia 550 , 640/640XL , 650 , 950/950 XL phones .
This should not come as a surprise as most of the phones represented run Windows as their OS and they are some of the newest ones released .
Therefore , continued support on these devices should be something expected .
PC users that have any variant of the Windows 10 OS will be receiving the Creators update .
However , this cannot be said by smartphones which are running Windows .
This is due to the threshold set by Microsoft in terms of the quality of the mobile devices that can support the new update .
Most of the mid to low tier smartphones will not be compatible with this new update and will most likely be abandoned as far as support goes .
The result of this decision is targeted more on the former CEO of Microsoft who completely ignored the competition and focused on getting everything tied into Microsoft ’s OS .
His concept was that one operation system would be dominating the mobile market .
To his dismay , Android has achieved this instead of Windows .
The current CEO has taken the strategy in a completely different direction and focused more on cloud services for their devices .
This will be the area of the market where the new strategy will be placed into effect , and perhaps this time , Microsoft will be the ones sitting winning the competition for the best cloud service .
Geeks have been fantasizing for many years about a fully automated lifestyle , where their gadgets magically power themselves and figure out how to best get online without your help .
The first piece of the puzzle is already being worked on by a number of companies and researchers , but Apple may be working on letting users create their own little personal networks with the help of radio frequency ( RF ) modules that will communicate amongst each other in order to maintain constant connectivity .
A recently - published patent application titled " Personal area network systems and devices and methods for use thereof " gives us clues as to how such a system would work .
Small devices that do n't have access to long - range communications protocols , like the iPod in your pocket or your wristwatch , could still be equipped with short - range protocols , like Bluetooth or WiFi .
From there , they could be set up to communicate with devices that do have long - range protocols , like your mobile phone or a some other wireless network .
What would be the benefit to this ?
For one , the smaller , less - capable gadget could take advantage of the protocols built into the more - capable device (s ) near you , allowing you to do things like get online or make phone calls .
" For example , a user may place or take a telephone call using the host device by wirelessly communicating with the long - range communications device via the short - range communications protocol .
Thus , an advantage of the invention is that the host device can serve as the interface for performing functions on both the host device and long distance communication device , " writes Apple .
Apple points out that the user may keep a number of RF modules on his or her person already , or in the home .
" This way , a user need not worry about having to carry a long - range communications device wherever he or she may go , as a RF module may be kept in locations frequently visited by the user . "
When that user moves around from one locale to another , the communications devices can connect to new modules in order to determine what 's the best way to make that call or send that text message .
The other obvious benefit to the system is that all of your gadgets are now talking to each other and can interact in ways that we have only just begun to explore in the consumer space .
One example that Apple provides is being able to sit down in your car and browse your contact list — stored on your phone — via the car 's navigational controls without ever having to plug anything into anything else .
You could also change songs on your iPod by fiddling with your wristwatch , or perform any number of other small tasks between devices depending on the functionality of each one — like , say , getting readings on your iPod about the abysmal condition of your running shoes .
The students were testing a method of investigating the light fluctuations of thousands of stars in the OGLE database in an automated way .
The brightness of one of the stars was found to decrease for two hours every 2.5 days by about one percent .
Follow - up observations , taken with ESO 's Very Large Telescope in Chile , confirmed that this phenomenon is caused by a planet passing in front of the star , blocking part of the starlight at regular intervals .
According to Ignas Snellen , supervisor of the research project , the discovery was a complete surprise .
" The project was actually meant to teach the students how to develop search algorithms .
But they did so well that there was time to test their algorithm on a so far unexplored database .
At some point they came into my office and showed me this light curve .
I was completely taken aback ! "
The students , Meta de Hoon , Remco van der Burg , and Francis Vuijsje , are very enthusiastic .
" It is exciting not just to find a planet , but to find one as unusual as this one ; it turns out to be the first planet discovered around a fast rotating star , and it's also the hottest star found with a planet , " says Meta .
" The computer needed more than a thousand hours to do all the calculations , " continues Remco .
The planet is given the prosaic name OGLE2 - TR - L9b .
" But amongst ourselves we call it ReMeFra - 1 , after Remco , Meta , and myself , " says Francis .
The planet was discovered by looking at the brightness variations of about 15 700 stars , which had been observed by the OGLE survey once or twice per night for about four years between 1997 and 2000 .
Because the data had been made public , they were a good test case for the students ' algorithm , who showed that for one of stars observed , OGLE - TR - L9 , the variations could be due to a transit -- the passage of a planet in front of its star .
The team then used the GROND instrument on the 2.2 m telescope at ESO 's La Silla Observatory to follow up the observations and find out more about the star and the planet .
" But to make sure it was a planet and not a brown dwarf or a small star that was causing the brightness variations , we needed to resort to spectroscopy , and for this , we were glad we could use ESO 's Very Large Telescope , " says Snellen .
The planet , which is about five times as massive as Jupiter , circles its host star in about 2.5 days .
It lies at only three percent of the Earth - Sun distance from its star , making it very hot and much larger than normal planets .
The spectroscopy also showed that the star is pretty hot -- almost 7000 degrees , or 1200 degrees hotter than the Sun .
It is the hottest star with a planet ever discovered , and it is rotating very fast .
The radial velocity method -- that was used to discover most extrasolar planets known -- is less efficient on stars with these characteristics .
" This makes this discovery even more interesting , " concludes Snellen .

The final judgment [ PDF ] from Utah is here at last .
It recites what the August 10 , 2007 and July 16 , 2008 orders said , but it also resolves the recent dispute over SCO 's desire to voluntarily waive some claims and then bring them back to the table after an appeal , should it prove successful .
Here 's SCO 's motion to voluntarily dismiss , and Novell 's response , so you can verify that this judgment indeed represents another loss for SCO .
You 'll see that it was Novell that suggested the wording regarding SCO 's voluntarily dismissed claims that we see in the judgment , that they be dismissed " without the possibility of renewal following appeal . "
SCO caved on its voluntarily dismissed claims , then , and Novell did not .
So , another loss for SCO .
No matter what happens on appeal , then , SCO can't resurrect those claims .
It can appeal the rest of the matters it lost in August 2007 and July of 2008 .
Novell , however , in an identical circumstance , can pull its voluntarily dismissed claims out of its back pocket and go after SCO .
And I 'm sure it would .
In the wording of the judgment , Novell has " the right to pursue these claims only in this action , should there be a subsequent adjudication or trial in this action . "
So if there were an appeal and SCO got the case sent back to Utah for a jury trial , for example , SCO 's favorite daydream , then Novell could bring back to the courtroom all its voluntarily dismissed claims .
Here , in contrast , is the wording on the SCO claims from the judgment : 3 . The remaining portions of SCO 's claims for Breach of Contract ( Count II ) , Copyright Infringement ( Count IV ) , and Unfair Competition ( Count V ) are voluntarily dismissed with prejudice , without the possibility of renewal following appeal .
So , all the tricky language SCO suggested to the judge was for naught .
Whew .
Here 's the docket entry :
11/20/2008 565 - FINAL JUDGMENT in favor of Novell , Inc. , SCO Group and also against Novell , Inc. , SCO Group .
Case Closed .
Magistrate Judge Brooke C. Wells no longer assigned to case .
See Judgment for details .
Signed by Judge Dale A. Kimball on 11/20/08 . ( ce ) ( Entered : 11/20/2008 )
Now it 's on to an appeal , if SCO can afford it , I suppose .
As SCO 's lawyer , Arthur Spector , told the court at the September hearing in the bankruptcy , that could take a year and a half or it could take five .
Of course , Novell could appeal also , independent of SCO , and it might decide to , in some alternate universe where companies throw away a hard - won victory .
I guess they could appeal the amount they won , trying to get it higher , or Novell might want to appeal the judgment from July that SCO had the right to enter into the Microsoft and SCOsource end user licenses .
I know I would like them to .
If SCO appeals , then I think Novell might just go ahead .
If not , who'd blame them for wanting to forget they ever met anybody called SCO ?
If it were me , I 'd decide based on whether I thought SCO was going to get new funding .
If they did , I 'd go ahead and appeal , because otherwise whoever buys up the litigation or backs it could restart SCOsource .
I think that 's what all the delay in bankruptcy has been about , actually .
SCO is n't so keen on showing its hand , I 'd imagine .
Anyway , after the lull in SCO news , for sure it 's going to get really interesting again pronto .

CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - Instead of infiltrating breaks in the skin , HIV appears to attack normal , healthy genital tissue , U.S. researchers said on Tuesday in a study that offers new insight into how the AIDS virus spreads .
They said researchers had assumed the human immunodeficiency virus , or HIV , sought out beaks in the skin , such as a herpes sore , in order to gain access to immune system cells deeper in the tissue .
Some had even thought the normal lining of the vaginal tract offered a barrier to invasion by the virus during sexual intercourse .
“ Normal skin is vulnerable , ” said Thomas Hope of Northwestern University ’s Feinberg School of Medicine said in a telephone interview .
“ It was previously thought there had to be a break in it somehow , ” said Hope , who is presenting his findings at the American Society for Cell Biology meeting in San Francisco .
He said until now , scientists had little understanding of the details of how HIV is transmitted sexually in women .
Hope and colleagues at Northwestern in Chicago and Tulane University in New Orleans developed a new method for seeing the virus at work .
They studied newly removed vaginal tissue taken from hysterectomy surgeries , and introduced the virus which carried fluorescent , light - activated tracers .
Then they watched under a microscope as the virus penetrated the outer lining of the female genital tract , called the squamous epithelium .
They also observed this same process in non-human primates .
In both cases , they found HIV was able to quickly move past the genital skin barrier to reach immune cells , which the virus targets .
Hope said the study suggests the virus takes aim at places in the skin that had recently shed skin cells , in much the same way that skin on the body flakes off .
The finding casts doubt on the prior theory of the virus requiring a break in the skin or gained access through a single layer of skin cells that line the cervical canal .
And it might explain why some prevention efforts have failed .
Hope said one clinical trial in Africa in which women used a diaphragm to block the cervix had no effect at reducing transmission of the virus .
Nor have studies of drugs designed to prevent lesions in genital herpes proven effective .
Hope said the findings emphasize the need for treatments such as a vaccine to prevent infection .
And it makes clear the need for the use of condoms , which are highly effective at preventing infection .
“ People need to remember that they are vulnerable , ” Hope said .
“ The sad part is if people just used a condom , we would n’t have this problem , ” he said .
In the United States , HIV is mostly passed among men who have sex with men .
Females account for 26 percent of all new HIV cases in the United States , according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
Globally , HIV is more commonly spread by heterosexual sex .
The virus has infected 33 million people globally and has killed 25 million .
Even as economic losses and unemployment levels mount , America 's most effective engine for wealth and job creation is being dangerously -- perhaps fatally -- compromised .
For more than 30 years the entrepreneurship - venture capital - IPO cycle centered in Silicon Valley has generated new wealth , commercialized innovation , and created new companies and industries .
It 's also spun off millions of new jobs .

The urban art

The idea to write this article came from something that was suggested to me as a " must read " , which was a story about a 20 year - old young man who was taken to a court room in Helsinki , Finland , accused of vandalism on the metro , trains and buses - actually , the young man was using colour spays and was doing graffiti .
Unfortunately it seemed as though he was going to visit a Finnish jail for a short period of his life ; of course , the accused pleaded his innocence and the court recessed to take a decision .
The young man , accompanied by an officer , went to the toilet and there , as the escorting officer later said , he heard ‘ scratching noises ’ and found the young man tagging the courthouse men ’s room with a magic marker .
The court decided to send him to prison and the police said that the damages this certain graffiti artist had caused to public transportation totalling up to 10,000 Euros .
In a search of the man 's house , the police found photographs of his work , sketches and , of course , a lot of colour spays and marker pens .
The problem here is that the state cannot see graffiti as form of art for only one reason : they cannot understand something that does n’t make a profit !
You see , you do n’t have to pay a ticket to see it ; it is just there on the wall - shocking , colourful , aggressive , provocative , sensitive .
I have never understood why graffiti supposedly dirties and vandalizes when all these adverts dirty and vandalize the minds of people in the worst possible way .
Actually , the only ones I think who are scared of graffiti are politicians and advertising company sharks .
The ones who really vandalize public transportation are all these adverts that rudely try to make you feel inefficient and want you to buy their products .
Bansky , the most famous graffiti artist in Britain , has reached the walls of galleries lately but still he prefers the anonymity of the brick walls of London .
He enjoys the adrenaline of the hide - and - seek with the police - you see , internationally graffiti is illegal !
Amazingly graffiti is not considered art by the artists who also know there is no better place to exhibit your work , your paintings , than on a wall !
Another amazing thing about graffiti is that one artist adds to the work of another - it is like a painting that evolves through different painters .
Graffiti is the absolute immigrant art ; the artists are strangers in their own cities !

There is no question that some remarkable pieces of art have resulted from graffiti street artists .
But the average contribution I see on some walls and scratched into the glass of Metro trains consists of badly written obscenities with no graphic merit whatsoever .
I 'm sure there are amusing things written on the inside of toilet booths but the lack of real talent or originality results in mere defacement , not art .
Perhaps street artists should be required to ask permission before committing their efforts to inviting spaces .
If they are good enough they might even get paid for their efforts .
I applaud the efforts in the discipline and it might be a good idea for the community to provide areas for people to try out their talents .
If they are good enough they might be preserved but if they are mere disgusting messes they could be quickly painted over with white to provide surface for someone else to try .
Competitions in the efforts could bring worthwhile publicity to the artists and provide a tourist attraction .

I agree there are a lot of rubbish but the same time there are some fantastic and real artistic works .
Actually a graffiti work has become the reason a long time ago for me to spent a week in Brussels and I was just passing by thinking that I will stay only one day !
It was the side of an old building near the train station and it was ... plainly fantastic !

EAST PROVIDENCE , R.I .
They came for the gravely ill racketeer last month , appearing at his North Providence home around dawn .
His time was near , but not as near as the police officers at his door .
He went peacefully .
Soon he was at state police headquarters , where veteran detectives knew him well : Nicholas Pari , once the smart - dressing mobster whose nickname , “ Nicky , ” had clearly not taxed the Mafia muse .
Now 71 , with gauze wrapped around his cancer - ruined neck : Nicky Pari .
The arrest , for running a crime ring from a flea market , put him in a reflective mood , and he said some things he clearly needed to say , including that he was dying .
Still , ever - faithful to that perverse code of the streets , he seemed insulted when asked about the deeds of others .
“ He would n’t cooperate beyond talking about himself and his past actions , ” says Col. Brendan Doherty , the state police superintendent , who knew Mr. Pari from long years spent investigating Rhode Island crime , back when it was more organized .

The Danger of Keeping Robert Gates Press reports say Barack Obama may retain George W. Bush ’s Defense Secretary Robert Gates as a gesture to war - time continuity , bipartisanship and respect for the Washington insider community , which has embraced Gates as something of a new Wise Man.

Printer friendly However , if Obama does keep Gates on , the new President will be employing someone who embodies many of the worst elements of U.S. national security policy over the past three decades , including responsibility for what Obama himself has fingered as a chief concern , “ politicized intelligence . ”
During a campaign interview with the Washington Post , Obama said , “ I have been troubled by … the politicization of intelligence in this administration . ”
But it was Gates – as a senior CIA official in the 1980s – who broke the back of the CIA analytical division ’s commitment to objective intelligence .
In a recent book , Failure of Intelligence : The Decline and Fall of the CIA , former CIA analyst Melvin A. Goodman identifies Gates as the chief action officer for the Reagan administration ’s drive to tailor intelligence reporting to White House political desires .
A top “ Kremlinologist , ” Goodman describes how Gates reversed a CIA tradition of delivering tough - minded intelligence reports with “ the bark on . ”
That ethos began to erode in 1973 – with President Richard Nixon ’s appointment of James Schlesinger as CIA director and Gerald Ford ’s choice of George H.W. Bush in 1976 – but the principle of objectivity was n’t swept away until 1981 when Ronald Reagan put in his campaign chief , William Casey , as CIA director .
Casey then chose the young and ambitious Robert Gates to run the analytical division .
Rather than respect the old mandate for “ bark on ” intelligence , “ Bob Gates turned that approach on its head in the 1980s and tried hard to anticipate the views of policymakers in order to pander to their needs , ” Goodman wrote .
“ Gates consistently told his analysts to make sure never to ‘ stick your finger in the eye of the policymaker . ’”
It did n’t take long for the winds of politicization to blow through the halls of CIA headquarters at Langley , Virginia .
“ Bill Casey and Bob Gates guided the first institutionalized ‘ cooking of the books ’ at the CIA in the 1980s , with a particular emphasis on tailoring intelligence dealing with the Soviet Union , Central America , and Southwest Asia , ” Goodman wrote .
“ Casey ’s first NIE [ National Intelligence Estimate ] as CIA director , dealing with the Soviet Union and international terrorism , became an exercise in politicization .
Casey and Gates pushed this line in order to justify more U.S. covert action in the Third World .
“ In 1985 , they ordered an intelligence assessment of a supposed Soviet plot against the Pope , hoping to produce a document that would undermine Secretary of State [ George ]
Shultz ’s efforts to improve relations with Moscow .
The CIA also produced an NIE in 1985 that was designed to produce an intelligence rationale for arms sales to Iran . ”
Hyping Soviet Power
One of the key distortions pushed by Casey and Gates was the notion that the Soviet Union was a military behemoth with a robust economy – rather than a decaying power with a shriveling GNP .
The logic of the Casey - Gates position was that exaggerating the Soviet menace justified higher U.S. military spending and U.S. support for bloody brush - fire wars – central elements of Reagan ’s foreign policy .
Since the mid-1970s , the CIA ’s analytical division had been noting cracks in the Soviet empire as well as signs of its economic - technological decline .
But that analysis was unwelcome among Reagan ’s true - believers .
So , in 1983 when CIA analysts sought to correct over - estimations of Soviet military spending – to 1 percent a year , down from 4 to 5 percent – Gates blocked the revision , according to Goodman .
From his front - row seat at CIA headquarters , Goodman watched in dismay as Gates used his bureaucratic skills to consolidate the agency ’s new role underpinning favored White House policies .
“ While serving as deputy director for intelligence from 1982 to 1986 , Gates wrote the manual for manipulating and centralizing the intelligence process to get the desired intelligence product , ” Goodman stated .
Gates promoted pliable CIA careerists to top positions , while analysts with an independent streak were sidelined or pushed out of the agency .
“ In the mid-1980s , the three senior [ Soviet division ] office managers who actually anticipated the decline of the Soviet Union and Moscow ’s interest in closer relations with the United States were demoted , ” Goodman wrote , noting that he was one of them .
“ The Reagan administration would not accept any sign of Soviet weakness or constraint , and CIA director Casey and deputy director Gates made sure intelligence analysis presented the Russian Bear as threatening and warlike , ” Goodman wrote .
These institutional blinders remained in place for the rest of the 1980s .
“ As a result , the CIA missed the radical change that Mikhail Gorbachev represented to Soviet politics and Soviet - American relations , and missed the challenges to his rule and his ultimate demise in 1991 , ” Goodman wrote .
When the Soviet Union – the CIA ’s principal intelligence target – collapsed without any timely warning to the U.S. government , the CIA analytical division was derided for “ missing ” this historic moment .
But the CIA did n’t as much “ miss ” the Soviet collapse as it was blinded by Gates and other ideological taskmasters to the reality playing out in plain sight .
Goodman was not alone in identifying Gates as the chief culprit in the politicization of the CIA ’s intelligence product .
Indeed , Gates ’s 1991 confirmation hearing to be George H.W. Bush ’s CIA director marked an extraordinary outpouring of career CIA officers going public with inside stories about how Gates had corrupted the intelligence product .
There also were concerns about Gates ’s role in misleading Congress regarding the secret Iran- Contra operations in the mid-1980s , an obstacle that had prevented Gates from getting the top CIA job when Casey died in 1987 .
Plus , in 1991 , Gates faced accusations that he had greased his rapid bureaucratic rise by participating in illicit or dubious clandestine operations , including helping Republicans sabotage President Jimmy Carter ’s Iran hostage negotiations in 1980 ( the so - called October Surprise case ) and collaborating on a secret plan to aid Iraq ’s dictator Saddam Hussein ( the Iraqgate scandal ) .
Despite significant evidence implicating Gates in these scandals , he always managed to slip past relying on his personal charm and Boy Scout looks .
For his 1991 confirmation , influential friends like Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman David Boren , D - Oklahoma , and Boren ’s chief of staff George Tenet made sure Gates got the votes he needed .
In his memoir , From the Shadows , Gates credited his friend , Boren , with clearing away the obstacles .
“ David took it as a personal challenge to get me confirmed , ” Gates wrote .
( Tenet ’s help on Gates also earned him some chits with the Bush Family , which paid off in 2001 when Tenet was Bill Clinton ’s last CIA director and was kept on by George W. Bush , whom he served loyally , if incompetently . )
After getting confirmed in 1991 , Gates remained CIA director until the end of George H.W. Bush ’s presidency .
However , even after Bill Clinton removed him in 1993 , Gates never wandered far from the Bush Family orbit , getting help from George H.W. Bush in landing a job as president of Texas A&M.
Damaging Documents During the Clinton years , documents surfaced implicating Gates in questionable actions from the 1980s , but the new evidence got little notice .
For instance , the Russian government sent an extraordinary intelligence report to a House investigative task force in early 1993 stating that Gates had participated in secret contacts with Iranian officials in 1980 to delay release of 52 U.S. hostages then held in Iran , a move that undercut President Carter .
“ R[obert ] Gates , at that time a staffer of the National Security Council in the administration of Jimmy Carter , and former CIA Director George Bush also took part ” in a meeting in Paris in October 1980 , the classified Russian report said .
In the 1980s , Moscow was very interested in the U.S. dealings with the new Islamic government of Iran , a neighboring country to the Soviet Union .
In July 1981 , the Soviets even shot down an Argentine - registered plane that strayed into Soviet airspace while delivering a supply of weapons from Israel to Iran , a secret shipment that had the Reagan administration ’s blessing .
The Russian allegation about Gates and the Paris meeting in October 1980 also did n’t stand alone .
The House task force had other evidence from French and Israeli intelligence officials , as well as witnesses from the arms - trafficking field , corroborating reports of Reagan - Bush contacts with Iranian officials in Europe during Campaign 1980 .
However , the House task force never followed up on the Russian report because when it arrived – on Jan. 11 , 1993 – the chairman , Rep. Lee Hamilton , D - Indiana , had already decided to get rid of the October Surprise case as part of a sweeping clean of investigations into alleged Reagan - Bush wrongdoing .
Years later , Lawrence Barcella , the task force ’s chief counsel , told me that in late 1992 evidence implicating the Republicans in the October Surprise caper had begun pouring in , so much so that he urged Hamilton to extend the investigation several months .
Instead , Hamilton ordered the inquiry wrapped up – and the October Surprise allegations rejected – all the better to start the new Clinton administration with a bipartisan gesture to the Republicans .
Like much of the other incriminating evidence , the Russian report was shoved into a box and stuck in a remote Capitol Hill storage room .
I discovered it in late 1994 after gaining access to the task force 's documents .
By then , however , there was almost no media interest in the “ old ” scandals of the Reagan - Bush years .
Not only were those stories dated , but many of the central players were either dead or – like Gates – out of government .

Iraqgate Scandal Gates also was implicated in a secret operation to funnel military assistance to Iraq in the 1980s , as the Reagan administration played off Iran and Iraq battling each other in the eight - year - long Iran - Iraq War .
Middle Eastern witnesses alleged that Gates worked on the secret Iraqi initiative , which included Saddam Hussein ’s procurement of cluster bombs and chemicals used to produce chemical weapons for the war against Iran .
Gates denied all the Iran - Iraq accusations in 1991 , and Boren ’s Senate Intelligence Committee never pressed too hard to check them out .
However , four years later – in early January 1995 – Howard Teicher , one of Reagan ’s National Security Council officials , added more details about Gates ’s alleged role in the Iraq shipments .
In a sworn affidavit submitted in a Florida criminal case , Teicher stated that the covert arming of Iraq dated back to spring 1982 when Iran had gained the upper hand in the war , leading President Reagan to authorize a U.S. tilt toward Saddam Hussein ’s Iraq .
The effort to arm the Iraqis was “ spearheaded ” by CIA Director William Casey and involved his deputy , Robert Gates , according to Teicher ’s affidavit .
“ The CIA , including both CIA Director Casey and Deputy Director Gates , knew of , approved of , and assisted in the sale of non-U.S. origin military weapons , ammunition and vehicles to Iraq , ” Teicher wrote .
Ironically , this same pro-Iraq initiative involved Donald Rumsfeld , then Reagan ’s special emissary to the Middle East .
An infamous photograph from 1983 shows a smiling Rumsfeld shaking hands with Saddam Hussein .
Teicher described Gates ’s role as far more substantive than Rumsfeld ’s .
" Under CIA Director [ William ] Casey and Deputy Director Gates , the CIA authorized , approved and assisted [ Chilean arms dealer Carlos ] Cardoen in the manufacture and sale of cluster bombs and other munitions to Iraq , ” Teicher wrote .
However , like the Russian report , the Teicher affidavit was never seriously examined or explained .
After Teicher submitted it to a federal court in Miami , the affidavit was classified and then attacked by Clinton administration prosecutors .
They saw Teicher ’s account as disruptive to their prosecution of a private company , Teledyne Industries , and one of its salesmen , Ed Johnson .
Gates benefited , too , from Official Washington ’s boredom with – and even hostility toward – Reagan - Bush - I - era scandals .
Instead , the polite and personable Gates continued to enjoy influential protectors on both sides of the aisle , from Republicans around George H.W. Bush to Democrats like David Boren and Lee Hamilton .
Plus , some of Gates 's CIA protégés , such as former Deputy Director John McLaughlin , were liked by Democrats as well as Republicans .
( McLaughlin was a member of Obama ’s intelligence advisory group during Campaign 2008 . )
Great Timing Gates ’s connections – and his timing – served him well when he was placed on the Iraq Study Group in 2006 along with its co-chairs , Lee Hamilton and Bush Family lawyer James Baker .
By fall 2006 , the ISG was moving toward recommending a drawdown of U.S. forces in Iraq .
Meanwhile , President George W. Bush found himself in need of a new Defense Secretary to replace Donald Rumsfeld , who had grown disillusioned with the Iraq War .
Though Rumsfeld was viewed publicly as a hardliner , privately he sided with his field commanders , Generals George Casey and John Abizaid , in favoring a smaller U.S. “ footprint ” in Iraq and a phased withdrawal .
Rumsfeld put his views in writing on Nov. 6 , 2006 , the day before congressional elections .
With Rumsfeld going wobbly , Bush turned to Gates and – after getting Gates ’s assurance that he would support Bush ’s intent to escalate the war , not wind it down – Bush offered him the job .
Rumsfeld ’s firing and Gates ’s hiring were announced the day after the Nov. 7 elections and were widely misinterpreted as signs that Bush was throwing in the towel on Iraq .
Rumsfeld ’s memo was disclosed by the New York Times on Dec. 3 , 2006 , two days before Gates was scheduled for his confirmation hearing .
[ See Consortiumnews.com ’s " Gates Hearing Has New Urgency . " ]
But Democrats on the Senate Armed Services Committee were so enthralled by the false narrative of Bush tossing over the ideologue ( Rumsfeld ) in favor of the realist ( Gates ) that they took no note of what the real sequence of events suggested , that Bush was determined to send more troops .
Gates was whisked through to confirmation with no questions about the Rumsfeld memo and with unanimous Democratic support .
Sen. Hillary Clinton and other senior Democrats praised Gates for his “ candor . ”
Within a few weeks , however , it became clear that Bush – with Gates ’s help – had bamboozled the Democrats .
Not only did Bush dash the Democrats ’ hopes for a bipartisan strategy on Iraq by junking the ISG recommendations , but he chose to escalate by adding 30,000 new troops .
Instead of negotiating with Iran and Syria as the ISG wanted , Bush sent aircraft carrier strike groups to the region .
For his part , Gates joined in pummeling the Democrats by suggesting that their legislation opposing the " surge " was aiding and abetting the enemy .
“ Any indication of flagging will in the United States gives encouragement to those folks , ” Gates told reporters at the Pentagon on Jan. 26 , 2007 .
“ I ’m sure that that ’s not the intent behind the resolutions , but I think it may be the effect . ”
During Campaign 2008 , Gates also opposed Obama ’s plan to set a 16 - month timetable for withdrawing U.S. combat forces from Iraq .
Nevertheless , Gates remains a favorite of the Washington insiders , many of whom – like Lee Hamilton – have expressed warm support for the idea of keeping him on at least for the early part of the Obama presidency .
If the President - elect is serious about taking that advice , he first might want to review the extensive evidence of Gates ’s devious behavior and consider whether Gates deserves the trust of the American people – and their newly elected government .

Last June , Al Jazeera English produced a report from Gaza about a young couple who were preparing to marry during the relative calm of the cease - fire between Hamas and the Israeli government , a time when they could finally shop for furniture and , as the reporter put it , let themselves “ dream that a happy life together is within reach . ”
Now that reporter , Ayman Mohyeldin , a former CNN producer , can be seen with a helmet and flak jacket answering questions from an anchor back in the studio in Doha , Qatar , describing the Israeli bombing and ground campaign in Gaza intended to stop Hamas missiles from being fired into Israel .
In a conflict where the Western news media have been largely prevented from reporting from Gaza because of restrictions imposed by the Israeli military , Al Jazeera has had a distinct advantage .
It was already there .
There are six reporters in Gaza , two working for Al Jazeera English and four working for the much larger and more popular Arabic version of the network , which was created in 1996 with a $ 150 million grant from the emir of Qatar , Sheik Hamad bin Khalifa al - Thani .
Al Jazeera describes itself on the air as “ the only international broadcaster with a presence there . ”
WASHINGTON , Dec. 28 ( UPI ) --
The Pentagon says religious literature can be dispersed at military recruitment sites across the United States , but no religion can get preferential treatment .
In addition to the rule against religious favoritism under the new Pentagon initiative , the U.S. military also ordered that all religious representatives be prevented from evangelizing at recruitment sites , The ( Norfolk ) Virginian - Pilot reported Sunday .

Publications that " create the reasonable impression that the government is sponsoring , endorsing or inhibiting religion generally " will also not be permitted at the locations , the Pentagon said in its new regulation .
The enhanced rules for the 65 recruit processing centers nationwide are an apparent reaction to multiple complaints from civil liberties groups .
The Virginian - Pilot said the groups had complained that certain ministries have been targeting the recruitment sites for their evangelizing efforts and attempting to draw in followers by tying themselves to the military .

Cyclone - style storms have ripped through parts of Queensland on Australia 's east coast .
They killed one man , destroyed homes and left more than 200,000 properties without power .
The storms hit the state capital Brisbane and the popular tourist areas of the Sunshine Coast and Gold Coast .
This was the worst storm to hit Brisbane in a quarter of a century , unleashing hail , torrential rain and strong winds .
Residents in one of its most badly - hit suburbs have said their streets resemble a war zone .
Most of the trees over 10 m ( 33 feet ) tall have simply been snapped in half .
" It looks like as if a bomb , a great big bomb , [ has ] gone off in all the street , " said Davina Thomas .
" We can't get out of our street , just walking down to the corner , there are power lines down , there are trees across the road , all we hear is ambulances or sirens I 'm not sure which .

A high - school calculus teacher scored a victory for capitalism and dealt socialized education quite a blow this year .
A recent article in USA Today reported that Tom Farber had devised a brilliant , free - market way of funding the tests that he felt were necessary for his students .
Mr. Farber was faced with a dilemma felt by teachers across the country .
His supplies budget was cut by the district , which meant that if Farber wanted to give his students the much - needed practice tests that would prepare them for later placement tests , he would have to find funding elsewhere .
Many teachers either would have paid for the additional expense out of their own pocket or deprived their students of the requisite practice tests .
Farber estimated that , had he paid for the copies out of pocket , it would have cost him almost $ 200 .
Unwilling to shortchange his students or to pay for the copies himself , the visionary teacher found an alternative : he began to sell advertisements on his test papers .
According to USA Today , he charged $ 10 per ad on quizzes , $ 20 per ad on chapter tests , and $ 30 per ad on semester finals .
Within a few days he had over 75 email requests for ads !
Farber has already generated $ 350 in ad revenue .
The article also states that approximately 67 % of the ad sales are inspirational messages , paid for by parents .
Others are from local businesses .
This free - market solution enables parents to voluntarily provide additional funding in order to help their children .
It also allows local businesses to benefit from targeted advertising .
Local businesses may also benefit from an improved labor pool due to the improved education students receive from their funding .
It is an excellent example of parties participating in voluntary exchange and everyone benefiting : students benefit from the improved education ; parents are pleased by improved placement scores ; and businesses benefit from a better labor force and more customers .
This is capitalism at its finest .
Unfortunately , we live in a time when the knee - jerk reaction is to demand more funding from the government .
Mr. Farber has demonstrated that free - market solutions are superior to any that can be provided by government .
This also provides a prime example of one of the fundamental flaws with government funding .
Government - funded organizations inherently rely on thinking in which decisions are made from the top and imposed on the lower levels .
This stifles the ingenuity of the people who have firsthand experience actually doing the work and defers decision making to bureaucrats and committees .
If we are to believe that monopolies are bad because they do not have the best interest of the consumer in mind and have little incentive to improve their product , then why are we to believe that a government monopoly over schooling is good ?
It can be reasonably argued that this particular government monopoly is worse than private - sector monopolies , because citizens are forced to pay even if they do not consume the service .
To illustrate the point , consider a hypothetical shoe monopoly .
If the government declared that shoes are a practical necessity of life in this country , and that there are people unable to afford the best - quality shoes available in the free market , would we then support a " shoe tax " to allow the government to manufacture and distribute shoes free of charge to everyone ?
In this scenario , citizens could still purchase shoes from other providers but would be forced to pay their share of the " shoe tax " as well .
Since the citizens are already paying for these government shoes ( through taxation ) , the demand for private - sector - produced shoes would be fairly low .
Since the demand for privately made shoes would be low , those who desire better shoes would be forced to pay prices that are far higher than those that existed prior to government shoes .
The citizens , seeing the high price tag on privately made shoes , would then conclude that they really do need government shoes because only an elite few could afford private shoes .
The success of Farber 's experiment shows that , contrary to the common contention , parents would not be forced to shoulder the cost of educating their children alone in the absence of public schools .
This is concrete proof that businesses do understand the importance of well - educated students and are willing to provide funding for such a valuable resource .
Advertisement revenue is not the only source of funding for schools but it is an important illustration of one of the ways of providing excellent education without extracting funds by force .
Under the current system , everyone is forced to provide funding for schools , regardless of how poor the quality of education provided by those schools .
Under a private system , various schools would compete for students and for funding .
Both parents and businesspeople would be more willing to devote their resources to the better schools .
Students would be the ultimate beneficiaries of such competition .
Many people would agree that the education provided in public schools today is far less than ideal .
While there are public schools that provide excellent educations for their students , the costs to taxpayers are too high and the funds are obtained in a highly unethical manner .
The lesson to be learned from the success of Farber is that truly private education is plausible and even preferable to the current education provided by the government .
Argentine ants fighting .
These ants are though to have come to the United States from Argentina aboard ships in the 1890s .
An ant species that originated in the Black Sea region has invaded more than 100 areas across Europe and is moving north .
Scientists say if it is not stopped , it will reach northern Germany , Scandinavia and Britain and could invade the whole world .
The pest , called Lasius neglectus , destroys native ant species as it invades new territory .
It has also invaded much of Asia .
This week in the journal PLoS ONE , scientists presented the first thorough study of the intruder , which was discovered in 1990 after moving into Hungary .
" Its rapid spread through Europe and Asia [ is ] the most recent example of a pest ant that may become a global problem , " the scientists write .
Ants rule
Ants thrive all over the world because they are very adaptive .
Urban ants , for example , have adapted to the extreme heat of city living .
Scientists estimate there are about 20,000 different species globally .
The combined weight of ants in the Brazilian Amazon is thought to be four times greater than the combined mass of all of the mammals , birds , reptiles and amphibians there .
When they arrive in new locations , ants can be extremely aggressive and very detrimental to local flora and fauna .
For example , the non-native red fire ant causes about $ 750 million of damage in the United States every year , the authors of the new study point out .
And the Argentine ant has spread along thousands of miles of coastline in southern Europe , exterminating the natural insect fauna .
In California , the Argentine ant armies have nearly wiped out all native ants .
Unbelieveable numbers
L. neglectus resembles the common black garden ant , but its colonies involve up to 100 times more workers .
It frequently settles in parks and gardens , the researchers say , and it quickly exterminates native ants .
" When I saw this ant for the first time , I simply could not believe there could be so many garden ants in the same lawn , " said University of Copenhagen researcher Jacobus J. Boomsma , a co-discoverer of the ant .
L. neglectus live in networks of interconnected nests , with many queens that mate underground and do n't fly .
So how do they spread across a continent ?
They infest potted plants , and humans carry them far and wide , the researchers said .
" The future will therefore see many more ants become invasive , so it is about time we understand their biology and this study is a major step in that direction , " said Jes S. Pedersen , who coordinates the invasive ant program in Copenhagen .
The rush for the safety of US Treasury debt is playing havoc with America 's $ 7 trillion " repo " market used to manage liquidity .
Fund managers are hoovering up any safe asset they can find because they do not know what the world will look like in January when normal business picks up again .
Three - month bills fell to minus 0.01 pc on Tuesday , implying that funds are paying the US government for protection .
“ The worth to a company to have the president always talking about a BlackBerry and how it absolutely is a necessity to keep in touch with reality ? ” he said .
“ Think about how far the company has come if they ’re able to say , ‘ The president has to have this to keep in touch . ’ ”

The maker of the BlackBerry , Research in Motion , recently introduced advertising campaigns and products like the touch - screen Storm that are meant to position BlackBerry as not just a business device but a consumer product like the iPhone .
The company , which declined to comment on Mr. Obama ’s enthusiasm for its product , also struck a sponsorship deal with John Mayer , a popular guitarist but hardly the leader of the free world .
“ The most powerful man in the country is saying , at this moment , basically , I ca n’t live without mine , ” Lori Sale , the head of artist marketing at the agency Paradigm , which pairs actors like Adrien Brody and Katherine Heigl with advertisers .
“ It represents their now complete and final crossover to a device that people adore . ”
Ms. Sale said that Mr. Obama had essentially participated in what is called a satellite media tour for BlackBerry by discussing the product with reporters .
Just a single day of a media tour , “ with the most A - list of A - list of A - list , would probably be 10 to 15 million dollars , ” she said .
That he is not paid to promote BlackBerry is even better for R.I.M .
“ What makes it even more valuable than that is how authentic it is , ” she said .
Mr. Kelly said the endorsement went both ways : while Mr. Obama was doing a lot for BlackBerry , BlackBerry had helped Mr. Obama ’s image by making his message seem more relevant .
TORONTO , June 24 ( UPI ) --
Toronto's city council , in a bid to clamp down on gun violence , approved canceling the leases of two shooting ranges operating on city property .
The move was the idea of Toronto Mayor David Miller , who last month called target shooting " a hobby that creates danger to others , " the Toronto Star reported .

Councilors voted 31 - 9 Monday night to cancel the leases of a range in the city 's east end and one in the downtown Union Station rail station , the Toronto Sun said .
" In a day when you can't bring a large tube of toothpaste on the plane with you , how could we possibly allow guns to wander through Union Station , the biggest transportation hub in Canada ? "
Miller said .
Bernard Becker , a member of the Union Station gun club board of directors , said the council showed ignorance of gun laws and gun clubs , and said target shooters still have to carry their weapons through Union Station and on public transit to other facilities .
The city bylaw also bans the opening of new gun clubs or gun-related manufacturing facilities , the Sun said .
Explaining how she felt when John McCain offered her the Vice - Presidential spot , my Vice - Presidential candidate , Governor Sarah Palin , said something very profound : “ I answered him ‘ Yes ’ because I have the confidence in that readiness and knowing that you can’t blink , you have to be wired in a way of being so committed to the mission , the mission that we ’re on , reform of this country and victory in the war , you ca n’t blink .
So I did n’t blink then even when asked to run as his running mate . ”
Is n’t that so true ?
I know that many times , in my life , while living it , someone would come up and , because of I had good readiness , in terms of how I was wired , when they asked that — whatever they asked — I would just not blink , because , knowing that , if I did blink , or even wink , that is weakness , therefore you can ’t , you just do n’t .
You could , but no — you are n’t .
That is just how I am .
Do you know the difference between me and a Hockey Mom who has forgot her lipstick ?
A dog collar .
Do you know the difference between me and a dog collar smeared with lipstick ?
Not a damn thing .
We are essentially wired identical .
So , when Barack Obama says he will put some lipstick on my pig , I am , like , Are you calling me a pig ?
If so , thanks !
Pigs are the most non-Élite of all barnyard animals .
And also , if you put lipstick on my pig , do you know what the difference will be between that pig and a pit bull ?
I ’ll tell you : a pit bull can easily kill a pig .
And , as the pig dies , guess what the Hockey Mom is doing ?
Going to her car , putting on more lipstick , so that , upon returning , finding that pig dead , she once again looks identical to that pit bull , which , staying on mission , the two of them step over the dead pig , looking exactly like twins , except the pit bull is scratching his lower ass with one frantic leg , whereas the Hockey Mom is carrying an extra hockey stick in case Todd breaks his again .
But both are going , like , Ha ha , where ’s that dumb pig now ?
Dead , that ’s who , and also : not a smidge of lipstick .
A lose - lose for the pig .
There ’s a lesson in that , I think .
Who does that pig represent , and that collar , and that Hockey Mom , and that pit bull ?
You figure it out .
Then give me a call .
Seriously , give me a call .
Now , let us discuss the Élites .
There are two kinds of folks : Élites and Regulars .
Why people love Sarah Palin is , she is a Regular .
That is also why they love me .
She did not go to some Élite Ivy League college , which I also did not .
Her and me , actually , did not go to the very same Ivy League school .
Although she is younger than me , so therefore she did n’t go there slightly earlier than I did n’t go there .
But , had I been younger , we possibly could have not graduated in the exact same class .
That would have been fun .
Sarah Palin is hot .
Hot for a politician .
Or someone you just see in a store .
But , happily , I did not go to college at all , having not finished high school , due to I killed a man .
But had I gone to college , trust me , it would not have been some Ivy League Élite - breeding factory but , rather , a community college in danger of losing its accreditation , built right on a fault zone , riddled with asbestos , and also , the crack - addicted professors are all dyslexic .
Sarah Palin was also the mayor of a very small town .
To tell the truth , this is where my qualifications begin to outstrip even hers .
I have never been the mayor of anything .
I ca n’t even spell right .
I had help with the above , but now —
Murray , note to Murray : do not correct what follows .
Lets shoe the people how I rilly spel Mooray and punshuate so thay can c how reglar I am , and ther 4 fit to leed the nashun , do to : not sum mistir fansy pans .
OK Mooray .
Get corecting agin !
Thanks ,
Murray , you ’re fabulous .
Very good at what you do .
Actually , Murray , come to think of it , you are so good , I suspect you are some kind of Élite .
You are fired , Murray , as soon as this article is done .
I ’m going to hire someone Regular , who is not so excellent , and lives off the salt of the land and the fat of his brow and the sweat of his earth .
Although I hope he ’s not a screw - up .
I ’m finding it hard to concentrate , as my eyes are killing me , due to I have not blinked since I started writing this .
And , me being Regular , it takes a long time for me to write something this long .
Where was I ?
Ah , yes : I hate Élites .
Which is why , whenever I am having brain surgery , or eye surgery , which is sometimes necessary due to all my non-blinking , I always hire some random Regular guy , with shaking hands if possible , who is also a drunk , scared of the sight of blood , and harbors a secret dislike for me .
Now , let ’s talk about slogans .
Ours is : Country First .
Think about it .
When you think of what should come first , what does ?
Us ourselves ?
No .
That would be selfish .
Our personal families ?
Selfish .
God ?
God is good , I love Him , but , as our slogan suggests , no , sorry , God , You are not First .
No , you do n’t , Lord !
How about : the common good of all mankind !
Is that First ?
Do n’t make me laugh with your weak blinking !
No !
Mercy is not First and wisdom is not First and love is super but way near the back , and ditto with patience and discernment and compassion and all that happy crap , they are all back behind Country , in the back of my S.U.V. , which —
Here is an example !
Say I am about to run over a nun or orphan , or an orphan who grew up to become a nun — which I admire that , that is cool , good bootstrapping there , Sister — but then God or whomever goes , “ It is My will that you hit that orphaned nun , do not ask Me why , do n’t you dare , and I say unto thee , if you do not hit that nun , via a skillful swerve , your Country is going to suffer , and do n’t ask Me how , specifically , as I have not decided that yet ! ”
Well , I am going to do my best to get that nun in one felt swope , because , at the Convention , at which my Vice - Presidential candidate kicked mucho butt , what did the signs there say ?
Did they say “ Orphaned Nuns First ” and then there is a picture of a sad little nun with a hobo pack ?
Not in my purview .
Sarah Palin knows a little something about God ’s will , knowing God quite well , from their work together on that natural - gas pipeline , and what God wills is : Country First .
And not just any country !
There was a slight error on our signage .
Other countries , such as that one they have in France , reading our slogan , if they can even read real words , might be all , like , “ Hey , bonjour , they are saying we can put our country , France , first ! ”
Non , non , non , France !
What we are saying is , you ’d better put our country first , you merde - heads , or soon there will be so much lipstick on your pit bulls it will make your berets spin !
In summary : Because my candidate , unlike your winking / blinking Vice - Presidential candidate , who , though , yes , he did run as the running mate when the one asking him to run did ask him to run , which that I admire , one thing he did not do , with his bare hands or otherwise , is , did he ever kill a moose ?
No , but ours did .
And I would .
Please bring a moose to me , over by me , and down that moose will go , and , if I had a kid , I would take a picture of me showing my kid that dead moose , going , like , Uh , sweetie , no , he is not resting , he is dead , due to I shot him , and now I am going to eat him , and so are you , oh yes you are , which is responsible , as God put this moose here for us to shoot and eat and take a photo of , although I did not , at that time , know why God did , but in years to come , God ’s will was revealed , which is :
Hey , that is a cool photo for hunters about to vote to see , plus what an honor for that moose , to be on the Internet .
How does the moose feel about it ?
Who knows ?
Probably not great .
But do you know what the difference is between a dead moose with lipstick on and a dead moose without lipstick ?
Lipstick .
Think about it .
Moose are , truth be told , Élites .
They are big and fast and sort of rule the forest .
Sarah took that one down a notch .
Who ’s Élite now , Bullwinkle ?
Not Sarah .
She ’s just Regular as heck . ♦

The Indian government has announced a number of steps to strengthen internal security after the Mumbai attacks .
Interior Minister P Chidambaram said a national investigative agency would be launched , anti-terror laws beefed up and coastal security strengthened .
It is the government 's first detailed response to the public outcry over the attacks which left at least 173 people dead , including nine of the 10 gunmen .
India says militants had Pakistani links and has urged Pakistani action .
Pakistan denies any involvement in the attacks , but has promised to co-operate with the Indian investigation .
It has been under tremendous Indian and American pressure to act .
The new Indian security plans were announced on the day a magistrate extended policy custody of the lone surviving gunman , Mohammed Ajmal Amir Qasab , until 24 December .
Challenge of terrorism
" We can not go back to business as usual .
We have to take hard decisions and prepare country and people to face the challenge of terrorism , " Mr Chidambaram , the newly appointed Indian interior minister , told parliament .
Mumbai suspect remanded by court ' Rot ' at heart of intelligence
He said a number of steps would be taken to bolster internal security .
• a national investigation agency would be set up • vacancies in the country 's intelligence agencies would be filled and they would be equipped with advanced equipment • a coastal command would be set up to secure India 's 7,500 km - long coastline • a total of 20 " counter - insurgency , anti-terrorism " schools would be set up in various parts of India to train to train police and security personnel • commando forces to be set up in the states • laws relating to terrorist acts would be beefed up • money laundering laws to be strengthened " We can not go back to business as normal , " Mr Chidambaram said .
The BBC's South Asia correspondent Chris Morris says India 's security system has not been properly reformed in decades and is in urgent need of repair .
Communication between state and federal level is poor and the whole structure is under - resourced and under - staffed , he says .
But while few will argue with the need to overhaul the security system , the proposal for tougher anti-terror laws will be more controversial , our correspondent adds .
There will be political disagreements between the government and the opposition about how tough they should be and how they should be targeted , he adds .
UN ban India 's interior minister also reiterated the government 's view that " the finger of suspicion unmistakeably points to the territory of our neighbour Pakistan " as the source of the attacks .
TEN NAMED GUNMEN Nasir , alias Abu Umar ( Nariman House ) Abu Ali ( Taj Palace ) Soheb ( Taj Palace ) Fahad Ullah ( Oberoi ) Mohammed Ajmal Amir Qasab ( survived ) Bada Abdul Rehaman ( above left , Taj Palace ) Abdul Rehaman Chota ( above right , Oberoi ) Ismal Khan ( CST station ) Babar Imaran ( Nariman House ) Nazir , alias Abu Omer ( Taj Palace ) Evidence gathered from the bodies of the dead gunmen and the boats they travelled to Mumbai indicated they were Pakistani nationals belonging to the militant group the Lashkar - e - Taiba , he said .
Foreign Minister Pranab Mukherjee told parliament Pakistan needed to demonstrate its commitment to root out militant groups in the country .
He said Pakistan 's raid on the main Lashkar - e - Taiba camp in Pakistan - administered Kashmir on Sunday needed to be followed up " with the complete dismantling of the infrastructure facilities " .
But he said attacking Pakistan was " no solution " .
The UN Security Council has added four leaders of Lashkar - e - Taiba to a list of people facing sanctions for links with al - Qaeda and the Taleban .
They face an assets freeze , travel ban and arms embargo .
The Security Council panel also said that the charity Jamaat - ud - Dawa was a front for Lashkar - e - Taiba and subject to sanctions .

Sanader last Christmas ...
The Croatian government has banned Christmas and New Year parties in the public sector because of the global financial crisis .
State - run firms and organisations have also been told that they wo n't be allowed to dip into their funds to buy Christmas presents .
The ban follows a proposal to freeze public - sector salaries next year .
Prime Minister Ivo Sanader said there was no need for panic , but the country had to be serious .
... and this Christmas
" I believe that with the proposed measures ... we can avoid a deeper crisis within the next year , " he added .
The government has promised to balance the budget in 2009 .
If this is achieved , it will be for the first time since Croatia became independent of the former Yugoslavia in 1991 .
Croatia is heavily reliant on earnings from its tourist industry and there are fears that visitor numbers will drop sharply next year .
According to reports , Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) , Kevin Martin , is on his way out .
It could spell an end for controversial plans to create a nationwide free wireless broadband system .
It was widely expected that newly elected President Barack Obama would have replaced Martin as chairman upon taking office .
( Martin would have remained as one of the five commissioners as that position was guaranteed until 2011 . )
Martin has opted to resign effective January 20th ( Obama 's inauguration day ) and will take up a post at the Aspen Institute , a non-partisan think - tank .
( Source : reuters.com )
The FCC regulates broadcasting and telephone use as well as determining government policy on many Internet issues .
Martin had been spearheading a plan to auction off frequencies which will be freed up when TV broadcasters switch to all - digital broadcasting next month .
Those plans had included forcing one auction winner to provide free wireless Internet across the nation , making its cash by charging for faster access services .
Opponents had argued it was n't the government 's business to make such demands and that Internet access should be left to the free market .
Martin had also been pushing for reforms to a system that decides how telephone call charges are split when two or more firms are involved .
The proposals were designed to be a fairer split and to help subsidize supply of broadband services in rural areas where it would otherwise be unprofitable .
Martin said funding for the reforms could come from allowing firms to charge up to $ 8.50 a month to provide fixed - line service ( currently capped at $ 6.50 ) , or by charging a $ 1 license fee on every handset sale , whether fixed - line or cellphone .
There is already a vacancy on the commission with the end of Deborah Taylor - Tate 's term in December .
Obama had reportedly been considering appointing Julius Genachowski , who drafted his technology policy during the Presidential election campaign , to both fill her commissioner post and take over as chairman .
( Source pcmag.com
While the change of chairman may alter FCC policy , Martin 's departure as a commissioner wo n't necessarily make any difference to its political stance .
That 's because FCC rules say that only three members of the same political party can serve as commissioners at one time .
If Democrat Genachowski does join the commission , the spot left by Martin will have to be filled by a Republican or an independent .
When General Motors was the biggest and most profitable auto manufacturer in the world , its strategy was to provide “ a car for every purse and purpose . ”
G.M. offered a panoply of distinctive brands , each targeted at a particular category of buyer — Buick for the successful but conservative driver , Cadillac for the wealthier and more flamboyant , and so on .
This was a tremendously successful strategy in the days when G.M. ’s domination was unchallenged .
But now , with G.M. losing billions of dollars a year and struggling to restructure , it just looks like a waste of time and money .
When analysts talk about how to turn G.M. around , most start with the need to slim down the company and get rid of less popular brands .
( Buick and Pontiac are perennial nominees . )
It ’s an eminently sensible approach , but it ’s unlikely to happen anytime soon , because it would challenge the interests of some of the most powerful players in today ’s auto industry — car dealers .
Car dealers , with their low - production - value TV commercials and glad - handing tactics , seem like the archetypal small businessmen , and it ’s hard to believe that they could sway the decisions of global corporations like G.M. and Ford .
But , collectively , they have enormous leverage .
Dealers are not employees of the car companies — they own local franchises , which , in every state , are protected by so - called “ franchise laws . ”
These laws do things like restrict G.M. ’s freedom to open a new Cadillac dealership a few miles away from an old one .
More important , they also make it nearly impossible for an auto manufacturer to simply shut down a dealership .
If G.M. decided to get rid of Pontiac and Buick , it could n’t just go to those dealers and say , “ Nice doing business with you . ”
It would have to get them to agree to close up shop , which in practice would mean buying them out .
When , a few years ago , G.M. actually did eliminate one of its brands , Oldsmobile , it had to shell out around a billion dollars to pay dealers off — and it still ended up defending itself in court against myriad lawsuits .
As a result , dropping a brand may very well cost more than it saves , since it ’s the dealers who end up with a hefty chunk of the intended savings .
You ’d think that what ’s bad for G.M. would also be bad for the people who sell its cars .
But G.M. makes money ( when it does ) on new cars and on the financing of loans .
Dealers , by contrast , make most of their money on servicing old cars and selling used ones .
So dealers can thrive even when the automaker languishes .
And at the state level they often have more political influence than automakers do .
In the late nineties , for instance , local dealers were challenged by companies that wanted to sell cars over the Internet .
In response , some states , including Texas , actually passed laws making it illegal to have a business selling cars online ( unless you already owned a local dealership ) , and regulators told Internet companies to cease and desist .
When Ford itself started experimenting with online sales , dealers ’ vigorous objections ( along with legal challenges ) caused the manufacturers to quickly retreat .
If automakers sometimes find dealers difficult to do business with , it ’s entirely their own fault .
Why , after all , have Ford and G.M. always sold their cars through independent dealers ?
They could have owned the dealerships themselves , with the salesmen being employees , much as Starbucks does today with its stores .
Instead , they preferred to give dealers franchises , and work with them as partners .
And , historically , the automakers were not good partners .
In 1920 , for instance , the U.S. economy went into a deep recession .
But Henry
Ford kept his factories running at full tilt , and forced thousands of Ford dealers around the country to buy new cars that they had little chance of selling .
The dealers knew that if they said no they ’d never see a Model T again , so they ate the inventory .
A decade later , when the Great Depression hit , Ford and G.M. used the same strategy to help keep the production lines going .
They turned their dealers into a cushion against hard times .
In the long term , this was a disastrous tactic , because it inspired mistrustful dealers to look to the government for help .
( The first franchise law was passed in 1937 . )
Dealers recognized that much about their businesses was always going to be out of their control — automakers not only decide what cars get made but also dictate sales strategies and incentive plans .
So they decided to protect what they could , using laws to insulate themselves from competition and from the risk of being dropped by the manufacturer .
And that ’s what has made life so hard for the automakers today .
The irony in all this is that G.M. and Ford adopted the dealer system because they thought it would make their lives easier .
A dealer who owned his own business would work harder than a mere employee , the thinking went , and would not require a lot of outside monitoring .
But the benefits that the car companies reaped from franchising cost them a lot in terms of control and flexibility .
There are now many things that G.M. ca n’t do ( like shut down Buick ) that it could do easily if it owned its own dealers .
Car companies might like to change this — in the late nineties , both G.M. and Ford tried to start buying up dealerships .
But , at this point , the system is self - protecting ; dealers revolted , state regulators started nosing about , and the automakers gave up .
They made a devil ’s bargain some eighty years ago , and now they ’re stuck with it .
Call it the revenge of the middleman .

Explaining why she would be a good Senator , she said : " So I think in many ways , you know , we want to have all kinds of different voices , you know , representing us , and I think what I bring to it is , you know , my experience as a mother , as a woman , as a lawyer , you know , I 've been an education activist for the last six years here , and , you know , I 've written seven books – two on the Constitution , two on American politics .
Barack Obama has assembled a team of rivals to implement his foreign policy .
But while pundits and journalists speculate endlessly on the potential for drama with Hillary Clinton at the state department and Bill Clinton 's network of shady funders , the real rivalry that will play out goes virtually unmentioned .
The main battles will not be between Obama 's staff , but rather against those who actually want a change in US foreign policy , not just a staff change in the war room .
When announcing his foreign policy team on Monday , Obama said : " I did n't go around checking their voter registration . "
That is a bit hard to believe , given the 63 - question application to work in his White House .
But Obama clearly did check their credentials , and the disturbing truth is that he liked what he saw .
The assembly of Hillary Clinton , Robert Gates , Susan Rice and Joe Biden is a kettle of hawks with a proven track record of support for the Iraq war , militaristic interventionism , neoliberal economic policies and a worldview consistent with the foreign policy arch that stretches from George HW Bush 's time in office to the present .
Obama has dismissed suggestions that the public records of his appointees bear much relevance to future policy .
" Understand where the vision for change comes from , first and foremost , " Obama said .
" It comes from me .
That 's my job , to provide a vision in terms of where we are going and to make sure , then , that my team is implementing . "
It is a line the president - elect 's defenders echo often .
The reality , though , is that their records do matter .
We were told repeatedly during the campaign that Obama was right on the premiere foreign policy issue of our day – the Iraq war .
" Six years ago , I stood up and opposed this war at a time when it was politically risky to do so , " Obama said in his September debate against John McCain .
" Senator McCain and President Bush had a very different judgment . "
What does it say that , with 130 members of the House and 23 in the Senate who voted against the war , Obama chooses to hire Democrats who made the same judgement as Bush and McCain ?
On Iraq , the issue that the Obama campaign described as " the most critical foreign policy judgment of our generation " , Biden and Clinton not only supported the invasion , but pushed the Bush administration 's propaganda and lies about Iraqi WMDs and fictitious connections to al - Qaida .
Clinton and Obama 's hawkish , pro-Israel chief of staff , Rahm Emanuel , still refuse to renounce their votes in favour of the war .
Rice , who claims she opposed the Iraq war , did n't hold elected office and was not confronted with voting for or against it .
But she did publicly promote the myth of Iraq 's possession of WMDs , saying in the lead up to the war that the " major threat " must " be dealt with forcefully " .
Rice has also been hawkish on Darfur , calling for " strik[ing ]
Sudanese airfields , aircraft and other military assets " .
It is also deeply telling that , of his own free will , Obama selected President Bush 's choice for defence secretary , a man with a very disturbing and lengthy history at the CIA during the cold war , as his own .
While General James Jones , Obama 's nominee for national security adviser , reportedly opposed the Iraq invasion and is said to have stood up to the neocons in Donald Rumsfeld 's Pentagon , he did not do so publicly when it would have carried weight .
Time magazine described him as " the man who led the Marines during the run-up to the war – and failed to publicly criticise the operation 's flawed planning " .
Moreover , Jones , who is a friend of McCain's , has said a timetable for Iraq withdrawal , " would be against our national interest " .
But the problem with Obama 's appointments is hardly just a matter of bad vision on Iraq .
What ultimately ties Obama 's team together is their unified support for the classic US foreign policy recipe : the hidden hand of the free market , backed up by the iron fist of US militarism to defend the America First doctrine .
Obama 's starry - eyed defenders have tried to downplay the importance of his cabinet selections , saying Obama will call the shots , but the ruling elite in this country see it for what it is .
Karl Rove , " Bush 's Brain " , called Obama 's cabinet selections , " reassuring " , which itself is disconcerting , but neoconservative leader and former McCain campaign staffer Max Boot summed it up best .
" I am gobsmacked by these appointments , most of which could just as easily have come from a President McCain , " Boot wrote .
The appointment of General Jones and the retention of Gates at defence " all but puts an end to the 16 - month timetable for withdrawal from Iraq , the unconditional summits with dictators and other foolishness that once emanated from the Obama campaign . "
Boot added that Hillary Clinton will be a " powerful " voice " for ' neoliberalism ' which is not so different in many respects from ' neoconservativism . ' "
Boot 's buddy , Michael Goldfarb , wrote in The Weekly Standard , the official organ of the neoconservative movement , that he sees " certainly nothing that represents a drastic change in how Washington does business .
The expectation is that Obama is set to continue the course set by Bush in his second term . "
There is not a single , solid anti-war voice in the upper echelons of the Obama foreign policy apparatus .
And this is the point : Obama is not going to fundamentally change US foreign policy .
He is a status quo Democrat .
And that is why the mono- partisan Washington insiders are gushing over Obama 's new team .
At the same time , it is also disingenuous to act as though Obama is engaging in some epic betrayal .
Of course these appointments contradict his campaign rhetoric of change .
But move past the speeches and Obama 's selections are very much in sync with his record and the foreign policy vision he articulated on the campaign trail , from his pledge to escalate the war in Afghanistan to his " residual force " plan in Iraq to his vow to use unilateral force in Pakistan to defend US interests to his posturing on Iran .
" I will always keep the threat of military action on the table to defend our security and our ally Israel , " Obama said in his famed speech at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee last summer .
" Sometimes , there are no alternatives to confrontation . "
Rice : Bush did n't ignore any 9/11 ' warning , ' because there was no ' when , where , how ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Thursday December 18 , 2008
Print This Email This Outgoing Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has acknowledged that she was responsible for the security failures that made possible the 9/11 attacks .
However , she did so only fleetingly and in a backhanded manner before returning to justifications of her actions .
" I do take responsibility -- but this was a systemic failure , " Rice told CNN 's Zain Verjee during an exit interview on Wednesday .
Verjee had begun pressing Rice with a question about whether she had ignored warnings of the forthcoming al Qaeda attack .
" This is simply not true , " Rice replied , saying that there had been only " a single item that said bin Ladin determined to attack  not when , where , how . "
Rice insisted the real cause of the failure was that " we did not have the capacity in our systems to share information between law enforcement , the intelligence agencies , and to be able to act in a very quick and decisive way . "
" The worst breach of national security in the history of the United States came under your watch , " Verjee persisted .
" Absolutely , " Rice agreed .
" Did you ever consider resigning ? " asked Verjee .
" Taking responsibility ? "
" I do take responsibility , " Rice finally acknowledged , " but this was a systemic failure .
...
We , the administrations before us , had not thought of this as the kind of war against the terrorists that we were going to have to wage . "
Verjee later brought up former Secretary of State Colin Powell 's recent statement that " frankly , the National Security Council system didnt function in a way that I thought it should have functioned .
We didnt always vet everything in front of the President . "
Rice , who was head of the National Security Council at the time of September 11 , insisted , " Any principal who ever wished to say something to the President , I facilitated it within hours  not within days , within hours .
And the President sat with his National Security team , and everybody had an opportunity to speak their mind . "

Lot of news flying around about the release of WordPress 2.7 , featuring new Administration Panel interface to make WordPress more usable and accessible .
Significant features and redesigns was added to WordPress 2.7 to make blogging on the new Dashboard Panel more valuable than ever .
You may find your Themes no longer work the way you are used to .
It could be that they might be broken , because something in WordPress that was fundamental to them changed , but it ’s also possible that you can get them working again by updating some settings , or maybe just a small edit .
This post will highlight WordPress 2.7 HOW - TO get your theme working again by updating some settings and represent some of the best and significant features added to your Administration Panel .
So let ’s get started and do n’t forget to subscribe to our RSS - Feed and visit my twitter page : nourayehia if you want to follow to keep track on our next post .
1. Enhancing your WordPress 2.7
Theme
1.1 . Enhancing Comment Display – Threading , Paging , etc .
WordPress 2.7 includes a lot of new enhancements , but one of the big ones is the new comment functionality .
Comments can be threaded , paged , etc .
Making your theme ’s comments compatible with WordPress 2.7 should be your first step when you edit your theme files .
Otto has written a detailed post on the new comment enhancements in WordPress 2.7 .
For details on how to update your theme to take advantage of these new features , please see the Enhanced Comment Display article .
1.2 . Make this post sticky
Previously we had to use a plug - in to place a post at the top of the front page for posts and keep it there after new posts are made .
With WordPress 2.7 you are now able to do this by just selecting a check box in your admin area > Edit Post > Publish panel >
Visibility : Public and click edit .
1.3 . Post Classes
Previously we used the code below to wrap a div around each post with a class=â€ œpostâ€ ?
< div id =" post -<?php the_ID ( ) ; ? > " class= " post " >
With WordPress 2.7 a new function for post classes is included , which will help theme authors perform simple styling and formating for the post area .
< div id =" post -<?php the_ID ( ) ; ? > " <? php post_class ( ) ; ?>>
The new function is post_class ( ) , where you will be able to to add your own classes as well .
< div id =" post -<?php the_ID ( ) ; ? > " <? php post_class ( ' style ' ) ; ?>>
The out put of this function is
< div class= " post sticky hentry category - icons style " id =" post -5966 " >
This will add a number of classes to the div : post , category - slug , tag - slug , class â€™stickyâ€™ ( if this post was marked as sticky from the admin area as mentioned in the previous point ) and your specified class name .
1.4 . wp page menu
Template Tag wp_page_menu acts as a wrapper for wp_list_pages , displays a list of WordPress Pages as links and support for Home page .
Because wp_page_menu( ) acts as a wrapper for wp_list_pages ( ) , all of the wp_list_pages ( ) parameters can be used with this Template Tag .
The following example causes “ Home ” to be added to the beginning of the list of Pages displayed .
In addition , the Pages wrapped in a div element , listed under the title , “ Page Menu ” , and Page IDs 5 , 9 , and 23 , are excluded from the list of Pages displayed .
<?php wp_page_menu('show_home=1&exclude=5,9,23&menu_class=page-navi&title_li= <h2 >' . __(' Page Menu ' ) . '< /h2 >' ) ; ?>
The output is something like this , where you will be able to have a complete control on styling the menu item and styling the menu item of the current page
< div class = " page - navi " >< ul > < li > < a href = " https://www.noupe.com " >
Home</a></li><li class= " page_item page - item - 10 current_page_item " >< a title= " About Noupe " href = " https://www.noupe.com/about ">About Noupe</a></ li>< li class=" page_item page - item - 43 " >< a title = " Advertise " href = " https://www.noupe.com/advertise ">
Advertise</a></li><li class=" page_item page - item - 1374 " >< a title = " Noupe Archive " href = " https://www.noupe.com/archive ">Noupe Archive</a></li></ul></div>
When you check the HTML output you will see â€œcurrent_page_itemâ€ ?
class name added to current menu item .
1.5 . Logout Link
wp_logout_url is a new template function for WordPress 2.7 , this will redirect the user who has logged out back to the page where the link was clicked .
< a href= " <? php echo wp_logout_url ( ) ; ?>" > Logout</a>
2. New Admin Area Features
2.1 . Keyboard Shortcuts for browsing and moderating comments
the ability to use keyboard shortcuts to browse and moderate comments was introduced .
These keyboard shortcuts are designed to save time by allowing you to rapidly navigate and perform actions on comments .
Keyboard shortcuts are enabled by visiting the Profile panel in Administration > Users > Your Profile .

Now you have the ability to reply to your user ’s comments from the admin .
A Popup reply form apears when “ Reply ” link is clicked , your reply is submited by AJAX .
2.4 . Allow plugin installations via web interface from Admin Area
The plugin installer allows for installing plugins from the WordPress Administration panels .
You can search for plugins by tag , plugin author , or by subject .
It also lists the featured , most popular , and recently added and updated .
When you click on the title of a plugin , you can see the details and choose to install it into your WordPress plugin list .
2.5 . Admin ’s new Navigation Menu
One of the best features of the new WP 2.7 feature is moving the top navigation to a side navigation .
The side navigation will allow users to expand and collapse sections to reveal the submenus without loading a new screen .
In addition , the entire navigation column is collapsible , with a remnant of icons providing an “ advanced ” mode that creates the largest possible working area .
2.6 . Interesting Dashboard Modules : QuickPress & Recent Drafts
A fast way to create drafts or posts that do n’t require the full metadata options of the Add New Post screen is using the QuickPress module found on the Dasboard area .

Building collections ...
Reasons people collect stuff
With the current state of the economy and many people getting laid off from their job or getting hours cut , budgets for many are getting tighter and tighter .
Even if the current economic crisis has n’t much affected you personally , you may still be taking proactive measures to be more frugal .
You may be wondering how you can start saving some money in various ways that will allow you to free up some space in your budget .
Believe it or not there are a variety of do it yourself ideas that you can easily incorporate into your life that do n’t cost much at all .
I hear often from my readers how they are looking for more frugal living ideas .
Ways to save money cut back and live on a leaner budget .
Here are some easy ways to save money and live on a smaller budget .
Learn to Sew your Own Clothes
This is not something I am good at but I have many friends who have taken up sewing and besides loving it they have become very good !
Purchasing new clothes is not cheap these days .
This is especially true if you have children , who need new wardrobes nearly every year .
However , if you learn to sew , you can make clothing yourself and save big time .
Even if you have to take a sewing class , it will be well worth it if you are able to sew your own clothes and some clothes for your family .
If fabric costs are a concern you can always design new clothes using thrift store finds .
For example , you can buy a couple cheap tank tops at a thrift store and sew a twirly fabric skirt onto them , creating low cost sun dresses .
If you need new clothes and you do n’t know how to fit it in your budget , consider sewing and you may be able to save some money .
Grow Some of Your Own Food
An easier solution because anyone can have a garden , even a patio garden with a few pots !
Groceries are getting more and more expensive as well .
It ’s so difficult when you go to the store and you find that simple food items have doubled in price .
Shopping for groceries really costs quite a bit of money , but there is something that you can do to save .
Growing your own food can help you to save on your grocery bill .
Planting some food in a garden or in a container garden is not expensive at all .
You can easily purchase seeds or even plants that have already been started .
Start growing them and you ’ll soon have some produce of your own .
Lettuce , tomatoes , and strawberries are all easy crops to start with .
This can provide some nice savings on your weekly shopping bill .
Our Strategies For Saving On Your Grocery Bill
So , we have to find ways to spend less on groceries while still getting the things that we need to feed ourselves and our families .
Here are six money saving tips to try the next time you go grocery shopping .
Here ’s my family ’s food budget strategy for continuing to eat organic in tough times :
Buy in season
Trying to eat organic summer vegetables in the winter will quickly put a dent in your food budget .
Right now , root vegetables , potatoes , and winter squash are at their cheapest and their tastiest .
Apples are also fresh and reasonably priced , and citrus comes into season around the holidays .
Use in - season vegetables and fruits to fill your family ’s table with affordable nutritious goodness .
Think ahead
Shop once a week , and do n’t shop for food while hungry .
Buying all of your food on one trip avoids the trap of running to the store several times , which burns extra gas and can add extra impulse buys to your basket .
Make a plan
Planning your weekly meals and sticking to it keeps you from buying whatever sounds good when you ’re shopping .
Always shop from a list .
Cook at home
I personally love to go out to eat because it means I ’m not cooking but eating out is not cheap !
If you are n’t a great cook , you can learn .
You can read articles and easily get recipes online .
Ask friends to share their favorite , simple to make , meal recipes .
Instead of spending so much money eating out or spending a lot on pre-made foods at the grocery store , you ’ll find that it is a whole lot cheaper for you to buy raw ingredients and make the meals yourself .
Not only will it save you quite a bit of money , but you ’ll be eating healthier meals as well .
Eating out will burn up your cash , and many restaurants serve food with dubious origins , so cooking from scratch makes the most sense to us .
If you do eat out , find a local place that serves real food , clean food , food made from scratch , not a can ( and organically grown , or at least MSG and GMO - free ) .
There ’s a place here in my neck of the woods that makes their own tempeh and has a 2 for 1 tempeh burger special ( Tempeh Tuesday ) .
The four of us can fill up for under twenty bucks .
Eat simple
For families that eat meat , cutting back meat - based dishes to once or twice a week means being able to afford organic or grass - fed choices .
Fill out a dish with grains or beans .
Making a casserole or soup can keep the menu simple and affordable .
Make extra
A large meal cooked once a week and served as leftovers or sent for lunches helps to save energy and water .
It ’s less stressful for the cook as well .
If you do eat out , find a local place that serves real food , clean food , food made from scratch , not a can ( and organically grown , or at least MSG and GMO - free ) .
There ’s a place here in my neck of the woods that makes their own tempeh and has a 2 for 1 tempeh burger special ( Tempeh Tuesday ) .
The four of us can fill up for under twenty bucks .
Raid the fridge
I ’m the king of the end of the week random ingredient meal .
I make a pot of rice ( or beans , millet , etc. ) , sauté onions and garlic with other random veggies , mix together , and serve wrapped in a tortilla .
Another option is to make good use of your leftovers , instead of letting them sit too long in the fridge and then having to throw them out at the end of the week !
Shop at the same stores
This is more of a frustration reliever .
In a new store , you spend most of your time looking for things and walking up and down every aisle , which oftentimes leads to forgetting an item or two .
Going to the same store each time makes you more familiar with the prices so you can estimate your bill as you write your grocery list .
Buy more staples than prepared foods
It is easier to buy a box of macaroni and cheese , but is it more economical ?
A large box of macaroni and a block of cheese will make more servings for your family than one box of prepared macaroni and cheese .
The next time you go shopping and pick up a box or bag of an already prepared item , ask yourself if you can make that at home for less .
If you can , then put that item back in favor of less expensive staples .
Clip coupons
They put those in the newspaper for a reason .
If there are new items you want to try , use a coupon to get it at a discount .
If you like it , you have saved some money .
On the other hand , if you do n’t take a liking to it , you did n’t pay full price .
For me , coupons save an average of ten or more dollars per visit .
That ’s money in my pocket that I can put towards gas for the car .
Buy in bulk
Consider the food items that you use most often .
Cereals , meats , vegetables , condiments , juices , and paper products can be bought in bulk usually at a lower price at food warehouses like Costco , BJ’s , and Wal - Mart .
If you have a coupon , you ’ll save even more money .
We try to have the staple foods on hand at all times , buying a month ’s worth or more and storing it in the pantry .
Many co-ops and health food stores offer discounts for case quantities and bulk bags of grains .
Most grains , beans , and flour is sold in 25 or 50 pound bags .
25 pounds of grains fits perfectly in a 5 gallon bucket , keeping it fresh and safe from bugs or rodents .
Check at hospitals or school cafeterias for free food - grade buckets .
Do n’t shop when you are hungry
This is a definite no - no .
Shopping on an empty stomach means that you will pick up more things than you need .
You are more likely to pick up that bag of chocolate chip cookies or that box of donuts when the growling gets underway .
Take a grocery list with you
This is another protection against picking up things that are too costly .
Check your cabinets and the fridge to see what you need and write them down .
Remember , the goal is to stick to the list as much as possible .
Rising prices do n’t have to mean a lean dinner table .
There are ways to make your food dollar go further and if you take the time to implement the ideas listed above as well as others of your own , you ’ll see savings each and every time you shop .
Make Use of Used Objects
This is the easiest thing we can all do if we just put our minds to it !
Making use of used objects in your home can be helpful .
Get creative with making things yourself .
Do you have an old pair of jeans lying around your home ?
If so , use your sewing skills to cut them off and make shorts .
Do you need a new handbag ?
Simply cutting the legs off a pair of old jeans and using the top of the jeans can be used to make a cool handbag that looks like a designer bag .
A tin can will look good as a pencil holder or planter .
A glass pop bottle can be a flower vase .
Look around your home and find things you do n’t use .
Figure out how you can use them for another use to save some money .
In what ways are you cutting back and living on leaner budget ?
Share your tips and tricks .

This post takes a close look at one awkward aspect of classic ( non-arrow ) FRP for interactive behavior , namely the need to trim ( or “ age ” ) old input .
Failing to trim results in behavior that is incorrect and grossly inefficient .
Behavior trimming connects directly into the comonad interface mentioned in a few recent posts , and is what got me interested in comonads recently .
In absolute - time FRP , trimming has a purely operational significance .
Switching to relative time , trimming is recast as a semantically familiar operation , namely the generalized drop function used in two recent posts .
In the rest of this post , I ’ll adopt two abbreviations , for succinctness :
type B = Behavior type E = Event
Trimming inputs
An awkward aspect of classic FRP has to do with switching phases of behavior .
Each phase is a function of some static ( momentary ) input and some dynamic ( time - varying ) input , e.g. ,
sleep :: B World -> B Cat eat :: Appetite -> B World -> B Cat prowl :: Friskiness -> B World -> B Cat wake :: B World -> E Friskiness hunger :: B World -> E Appetite
As a first try , our cat prowls upon waking and eats when hungry , taking into account its surrounding world :
cat1 :: B World -> B
Cat cat1 world = sleep world `switcher` ( ( flip prowl world < $> wake world ) `mappend` ( flip eat world < $> hunger world ) )
The ( < $ > ) here , from Control .
Applicative , is a synonym for fmap .
In this context ,
(<$ > ) :: ( a -> B Cat ) -> E a -> E ( B Cat )
The FRP switcher function switches to new behavior phases as they ’re generated by an event , beginning with a given initial behavior :
switcher :: B a -> E ( B a ) ->
B a
And the mappend here merges two events into one , combining their occurrences .
When switching phases , we generally want the new phase to start responding to input exactly where the old phase left off .
If we ’re not careful , however , the new phase will begin with an old input .
I ’ve made exactly this mistake in defining cat1 above .
Consequently , each new phase will begin by responding to all of the old input and then carry on .
This meaning is both unintended and is very expensive ( the dreaded “ space - time ” leak ) .
This difficulty is not unique to FRP .
In functional programming , we have to be careful how we hold onto our inputs , so that they can get accessed and freed incrementally .
I do n’t think the difficulty arises much in imperative programming , because input ( like output ) is destructively altered , and programs have access only to the current state .
I ’ve done it wrong above , in defining cat .
How can I do it right ?
The solution / hack I came up for Fran was to add a function that trims ( “ ages ” ) dynamic input while waiting for event occurrences .
trim :: B b -> E a -> E ( a , B b )
trim b e follows b and e in parallel .
At each occurrence of e , the remainder of b is paired up with the event data from e .
Now I can define the interactive , multi- phase behavior I intend :
cat2 :: B World -> B
Cat cat2 world = sleep world `switcher` ( ( uncurry prowl < $> trim world ( wake world ) ) `mappend` ( uncurry eat < $> trim world ( hunger world ) ) )
The event trim world ( wake world ) occurs whenever wake world does , and has as event data the cat ’s friskiness on waking , plus the remainder of the cat ’s world at the occurrence time .
The “ uncurry prowl < $ > ” applies prowl to each friskiness and remainder world on waking .
Similarly for the other phase .
I think this version defines the behavior I want and that it can run efficiently , assuming that trim e b traverses e and b in parallel ( so that laziness does n’t cause a space - time leak ) .
However , this definition is much trickier than what I ’m looking for .
One small improvement is to abstract a trimming pattern :
trimf :: ( B i -> E o ) -> ( B i -> E ( o , B i ) ) trimf ef i = trim i ( ef i ) cat3 :: B World -> B
Cat cat3 world = sleep world `switcher` ( ( uncurry prowl < $> trimf wake world ) `mappend` ( uncurry eat < $> trimf hunger world ) )
A comonad comes out of hiding
The trim functions above look a lot like snapshotting of behaviors :
snapshot :: B b -> E a -> E ( a , b ) snapshot_ :: B b -> E a -> E b
Indeed , the meanings of trimming and snapshotting are very alike .
They both involving following an event and a behavior in parallel .
At each event occurrence , snapshot takes the value of the behavior at the occurrence time , while trim takes the entire remainder from that time on .
Given this similarlity , can one be defined in terms of the other ?
If we had a function to “ extract ” the first defined value of a behavior , we could define snapshot via trim .
b `snapshot` e = fmap ( second extract ) ( b `trim` e ) extract :: B a -> a
We can also define trim via snapshot , if we have a way to get all trimmed versions of a behavior — to “ duplicate ” a one - level behavior into a two - level behavior :
b `trim` e = duplicate b `snapshot` e duplicate :: B a -> B ( B a )
If you ’ve run into comonads , you may recognize extract and duplicate as the operations of Comonad , dual to Monad ‘s return and join .
It was this definition of trim that got me interested in comonads recently .
In the style of Semantic editor combinators ,
snapshot = ( result.result.fmap.second ) extract trim
or
trim = argument remainders R.snapshot
The extract function is problematic for classic FRP , which uses absolute ( global ) time .
We do n’t know with which time to sample the behavior .
With relative - time FRP , we ’ll only ever sample at ( local ) time 0 .
Relative time
So far , the necessary trimming has strong operational significance : it prevents obsolete reactions and the consequent space - time leaks .
If we switch from absolute time to relative time , then trimming becomes something with familiar semantics , namely drop , as generalized and used in two of my previous posts , Sequences , streams , and segments and Sequences , segments , and signals .
The semantic difference : trimming ( absolute time ) erases early content in an input ; while dropping ( relative time ) shifts input backward in time , losing the early content in the same way as drop on sequences .
What ’s next ?
While input trimming can be managed systematically , doing so explicitly is tedious and error prone .
A follow - up post will automatically apply the techniques from this post .
Hiding and automating the mechanics of trimming allows interactive behavior to be expressed correctly and without distraction .
Another post will relate input trimming to the time transformation of interactive behaviors , as discussed in Why classic FRP does not fit interactive behavior .
This post takes a close look at one awkward aspect of classic ( non-arrow ) FRP for interactive behavior , namely the need to trim ( or “ age ” ) old input .
Failing to trim results ...
It 's actually kind of amazing how much dough Microsoft has spent over the past little while in an attempt to polish its image in the minds of the general populace , and as if those " I 'm proud to be a PC " and completely incomprehensible Gates / Seinfeld spots were n't enough , the Redmond - based outfit is about to roll out its own clothing line ( dubbed " Softwear " ) this month .
And no , we 're not kidding .
Not even a little .
Microsoft has purchased the assistance of Crispin Porter & Bogusky in order to ensure the results are actually desirable , and it has also hired rapper Common as a spokesman .
We can't definitively say the shirt you see above is as fly as Pharrell 's Gizmondo Enzo tee , but we 'd rock it .
We 'd rock it hard .

Shia LaBeouf Drops Film Project , Schedules Hand Surgery
, Eagle Eye star , has been recovering from a serious hand injury that he suffered in a July 27 rollover .
He had extensive surgery on his crushed hand immediately after the accident and was able to complete filming of Transformers : Revenge of the Fallen .
His latest project , Dark Fields , is another matter .
The role would have had LaBeouf 's character stumbling upon a one - of - a - kind smart pill .
Production has already been delayed and apparently can't wait any longer so the action film , directed by Neil Burger , will move along without Shia .
LaBeouf , whose injury was far more serious than most thought , will undergo another procedure to repair the area around his thumb .
Check out photos of the crash here .
Take a peek at our red carpet photos of LaBeouf and Megan Fox .
